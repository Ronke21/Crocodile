<text>Wo Shing Wo or WSW () is the oldest of the Wo Group triad societies, and is the triad with the longest history in Hong Kong. According to the Hong Kong police, the triad is involved in extortion, drug trafficking, gambling and prostitution.

Wo Shing Wo was established in Sham Shui Po in 1930. While maintaining its traditional stronghold in Tsuen Wan, it has extended its influence to Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. It also operates in Tai Po, Sheung Shui and Fanling. The group continues to use the old Hongmen Secret Society initiating ceremony for newly recruited members.

==History==

===Early===

The Wo Shing Wo triad was established in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong in 1930. Like most Chinese triads, the organization&#x27;s roots date back to secret societies founded during the Ming and Qing dynasties. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945, the Wo Shing Wo collaborated with the occupational government. Due to the post-World War II continuation of the Chinese Civil War, numerous refugees from China fled to Hong Kong, many of whom were recruited into the Wo Shing Wo. By the 1950s, the total Wo Shing Wo membership had expanded from roughly 15,000 to approximately 70,000.

===Modern===
In 1989, Wo Shing Wo became the centre of media attention after the terrorist attacks on the Indonesian coast bordering the South China Sea.
In 1995, a young member of London&#x27;s mainly Filipino Wo Shing Wo killed Philip Lawrence, a school headmaster.

As the United Kingdom prepared for the handover of Hong Kong back to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Wo Shing Wo redefined their organisation to prepare for their murky operations in mainland China. WSW split into six separate regional forces in Hong Kong—500 fully armed members in North Territories, hawkers in Sham Shui Po, love hotels in Jordan, with groups in Tsuen Wan, Wanchai and a new branch across the border in Shenzhen (1997).

In 2001, Wo Shing Wo traded drugs in discos and bars with Judi Fong and religious communities, promising that drugs can enhance religious experiences through visions and hallucinations.
By 2005 WSW has become Hong Kong&#x27;s No.1 drug trafficker.
WSW&#x27;s drug dealing activities and key criminal activities spread to China, Japan, Thailand and Australia.
WSW is involved in various criminal activities and some of Hong Kong&#x27;s politicians and businessmen are suspected to be supporters of the Triad group.
WSW is split into two main forces, one based in Macau and another in Shenzhen.
WSW began to emerge in Europe.

By 2006 Wo Shing Wo has control over the secondhand market in Hong Kong, including mobile phones, electronic appliances, stolen cars and exchange of weaponry at Mong Kok.
Wo Shing Wo members are attacked by members of Wo on Lok. Firearms are used and many are hurt.
Wo Shing Wo raises crime rate in Chinatown, London, United Kingdom.

In 2014, the Triad was thought by police to be responsible for the brutal stabbing on 26 February of Kevin Lau, a journalist known for his tough reporting on China, who had been fired from his position as the editor of the Ming Pao newspaper. The attack took place three days after thousands of people had demonstrated for press freedom, as a result of the dismissal. and was carried out by an assailant riding pillion on a motorbike, which had been stolen in Fanling.

===Minibus racket===
From 2006 to at least 2010, the group controlled three red minibus routes and was extorting at least HK$14 million a year as protection fees from 30 drivers. Former group Dragonhead &quot;Broken Mouth Bun&quot;, who, police say, is the leader of the group running the Tsuen Wan – Kwun Tong route, was arrested and bailed on 21 March 2010 in connection with the scheme. On each route, about 30 drivers pay at least HK$10,000 a month as a &quot;protection fee&quot; to the Wo Shing Wo. The WSW then make sure no other driver could run the routes, leaving the drivers able to earn HK$10,000 and HK$20,000 a month. Three other minibus routes running between Tsuen Wan and Kowloon East – Choi Hung, Tsz Wan Shan and Ngau Tau Kok – are controlled by another Wo Shing Wo leader.

==International activity==
===Australia===
A 1992 internal report by the Asian division of the Victoria Police documented Wo Shing Wo activity in Melbourne. The group is involved in the importation of heroin into Australia from Southeast Asia, as well as illegal gambling, illegal prostitution, extortion, immigration malpractice and money laundering. Chinese criminal groups are the primary wholesalers of heroin in Australia; street-level distribution in Melbourne is mainly outsourced to Vietnamese and Romanian groups.

===Belgium===
The Wo Shing Wo has a presence in Antwerp, where it is active in heroin trafficking, money laundering, gambling and illegal workshops. The group also uses Belgium as a transit port for illegal immigrants.

===Canada===
The Wo Shing Wo was established in Toronto in 1930 as an international branch of the Wo Hop To, which had been founded in 1908. The Wo shing Wo deal cocaine to the people in Hong Kong Kowloon and Macau. Their leader Wong Ying Ding was killed and now they are with no leader.

===France===
The Wo Shing Wo is among five triad groups active in France. These gangs cooperate with Albanian and Turkish groups in the importation of heroin from the Golden Triangle.

===Ireland===
The Wo Shing Wo is active in Dublin and Cork. Triads gained a firm foothold in Ireland in the 1980s, when large numbers of Chinese restaurants opened in these cities. Leaked diplomatic cables obtained by the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; in 2011 included intelligence reports by the &quot;Garda Síochána&quot; (Irish police) on Chinese organized crime in the country, specifically the activities of the Wo Shing Wo and their rival 14K. The reported criminal activities of the triads included the trafficking of women and children from China into Ireland, involvement in casinos, and money laundering. Gardaí also reported a great deal of interaction between the Chinese gangs operating in Ireland and Scotland. In March 2002, four self-confessed Wo Shing Wo members were deported from Ireland after being involved in several assaults and robberies in Dublin. Eight people believed to be working for the Wo Shing Wo, including a senior member of the gang, were arrested after local gardaí and members of the Garda National Drug Unit raided cannabis-growing operations at two homes in Drumshambo, County Leitrim in March 2009. In November 2012, 113 mostly Chinese and Vietnamese nationals were arrested in raids on 236 properties, suspected of growing, smuggling and selling cannabis in Ireland. Many of those arrested were believed to be connected to the Wo Shing Wo and operating under the orders of gang leaders in the UK.

===Netherlands===
The Wo Shing Wo branch in the Netherlands was founded and primarily operates in Rotterdam. In the 1970s, the group battled the 14K and Ah Kong for control of the heroin trade in Amsterdam. In addition to heroin trafficking, the group also operates gambling, prostitution, money laundering, loan sharking, robbery, extortion and human trafficking. The Wo Shing Wo has more recently also closely cooperated with the 14K.

===South Africa===
Since the mid-1980s, the Wo Shing Wo has been one of four Hong Kong triad groups operating in South Africa, predominantly in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Acting independently from the Hong Kong branch, the group&#x27;s activities in the country include fraud, drug trafficking, firearms smuggling, extortion, money laundering, prostitution, illegal gambling, the smuggling of illegal immigrants, tax evasion, and the large-scale importing of counterfeit goods. The Wo Shing Wo was formerly heavily involved in the illegal harvesting and exportation of abalone (in 2000, the estimated gross income from the illegal exportation of abalone to Hong Kong was US$32 million).

===United Kingdom===

The Wo Shing Wo operates in London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Birmingham, Liverpool and Glasgow. Authorities believe the Wo Shing Wo is the largest triad group in the country. Beginning in the late 1980s, the Wo Shing Wo has been involved in the distribution in the United Kingdom of heroin and counterfeit goods from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. The group has also been involved in conflicts with rival triad gangs over control of the stores selling pirated videos originating in China. The Wo Shing Wo in Scotland has cooperated with the 14K in cigarette smuggling.

Restaurant owner and alleged Shui Fong &quot;white paper fan&quot; (business adviser) Philip Wong was murdered by a gang of contract killers armed with machetes in Glasgow on 9 October 1985. It is believed Wong was murdered after refusing to do business with the Wo Shing Wo who wanted a share of his lucrative Chinese video rental business. Three men wanted for the murder have never been traced. In February 1999, Wo Shing Wo member and former Glasgow brothel manager Tony Yeung was jailed for his part in a multi-million-pound fake credit card scam. Wo Shing Wo footsoldiers ambushed 14K members in a machete attack on Glasgow&#x27;s Sauchiehall Street in July 2003 in a dispute over the control of protection rackets. Wo Shing Wo members Jerome Castrillo, Ryan Parker-Saunders, Yu Xiang Liu, and Cho Wei Leong were convicted of the November 2007 murder of drug dealer Michael McGrath at the Old Bailey in November 2008. McGrath had allowed the gang to stash crack cocaine and heroin at his Carshalton home but was beaten to death after he began helping himself to the drugs. In January 2013, four men – Yik Fung Ng, Hiu Nelson Yeung, Chiu Yuen Li, and Siu Hung Yeung – associated with the Wo Shing Wo but who denied being members of the group were convicted of violent disorder following a street fight involving up to thirty men in Manchester&#x27;s Chinatown in June 2010. During the trial, it was alleged that one side of the conflict included Wo Shing Wo members and associates who had bullied young men who socialised in Chinatown into paying to join their ranks, and that the violence erupted because a group of young men had refused.

<text>The Swan Brewery is a brewing company, whose high profile brewery was once located beside the Swan River, in Perth, Western Australia.

==History==
The brewery was established in 1857 by Frederick Sherwood at the foot of what is now Sherwood Court in Perth. The brewery was named for the black swans that Sherwood had seen on the river.
Sherwood inherited a successful building firm from his father Richard in 1831 and migrated to the Swan River Colony, with his wife Jessey and three children in 1843. Sherwood, who had been working as an architect/surveyor/builder, established the brewery after the death of his wife, in order to support his six children. He saw the Swan River as the ideal place to build a brewery, as the Swan provided fresh, clean water for making the beer, hiring convicts as a source of cheap labour.
Following Sherwood&#x27;s death in 1874, the family offered the Swan Brewery for lease. The lease was taken up by the partnership of John Maxwell Ferguson and William Mumme, who appreciated the value of its pure water supply. In 1879 the Swan Brewery was moved to a site at the foot of Mount Eliza not far from the Stanley Brewery and another new brewery, the Lion Brewery. The former buildings continued to be used as a bottling plant. In 1886 the partnership between Ferguson and Mumme was dissolved and Mumme continued as part owner of the Swan Brewery. The Swan Brewery Company Ltd was incorporated in Melbourne in 1887.In 1888 the Swan Brewery took over the neighbouring Lion Brewery. In 1906 the bottling works attached to the brewery were destroyed by fire, with a new facility constructed closer to the city. In 1927 Swan acquired control of Fremantle&#x27;s Castlemaine Brewery. In 1928 the Emu Brewery Ltd which can trace its origins back to the Albion Brewery was purchased by the Swan Brewery. In 1945 Swan bought the last other Western Australian brewing company, the Kalgoorlie Brewing Company. The brewery extended its operations to the Northern Territory in 1957, but in 1972 lost its foothold there to Carlton and United Breweries. The brewery ceased production at the Mounts Bay site in 1966 and moved all brewing operations to the Emu Brewery site in Spring Street. In 1966, it made an arrangement to brew Skol beer in Western Australia, discontinuing the line in 1975. In 1972, it invested in the New Guinea company of San Miguel and Swan Holdings Ltd, which it sold in 1974. In 1978 the brewery was relocated to Canning Vale, an industrial estate in Perth&#x27;s southern suburbs. In October 1981 Alan Bond, through his company, Bond Corporation purchased the Swan Brewery for A$164M. In 1983 Bond Corporation acquired Castlemaine Tooheys for A$1,200M, and with this acquisition Bond Corporation controlled approximately half of Australia&#x27;s beer market, virtually all of Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. In 1982 the Swan Brewery became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alan Bond&#x27;s Bond Corporation. In September 1990 New Zealand brewing company, Lion Nathan purchased a 50% stake in Bond Corporation&#x27;s brewing operations, Bond Brewing (which included the Swan Brewery), subsequently purchasing the remainder of the company two years later. , Swan Brewery Pty Ltd, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lion Nathan operating as independent brewery under the Lion Nathan umbrella. In 2009 Lion Nathan was taken over by Japanese brewer, Kirin Brewery Company.

On 12 October 2012 Lion Nathan resolved to close the Canning Vale operations of the Swan Brewery by March 2013 and move production interstate. The Swan and Emu beer brands and keg production would be transferred to the company&#x27;s West End Brewery in South Australia and pack production would move to James Boag &amp; Son Brewery in Tasmania.

==Old Swan Brewery site==

The buildings that comprise the Old Swan Brewery complex were originally built in 1838 as a mill for timber-cutting as well as flour-grinding. These were the first steam driven mills in Western Australia, and were later taken over as one of the first convict depots (following the acceptance of convict transportation by the colony in 1850). The buildings were subsequently (between 1859 and 1879) used as a tannery, and at one time contained a restaurant (used by travellers between Perth and Fremantle). In 1877 it was acquired by the Swan Brewery Company. The brewery buildings constructed in 1879 on the Swan River foreshore beneath Mount Eliza became one of Perth&#x27;s dominant and favourite landmarks. It was surrounded by a complex of other buildings which have since been demolished or redeveloped. The car-park building on the opposite side of Mount&#x27;s Bay Road replaced the historic stables which caught fire and were demolished in 1988. Nevertheless, the state&#x27;s Heritage Council noted that, prior to redevelopment, 
The place contains, albeit partially demolished, the finest connected group of late-Victorian and early 20th-century brewery buildings in Australia in a red brick and tile Federation style idiom.

===1989–90 protest against redevelopment===
In 1989, the Western Australian state government vested the site in the building company Multiplex for a peppercorn rental, with a view to its being redeveloped as a commercial precinct. Perth&#x27;s Noongar community reminded the state government of the site&#x27;s ancient and sacred Indigenous Australian significance, and established a protest camp on the site, while challenging the issue at law and seeking to have the land reclassified as a public reserve. They were opposed by a Brewery Preservation Group which argued the indisputable heritage value of at least the 1879 industrial building. The developers argued that the brewery had been built on land reclaimed from the Swan River and, therefore, the site of Noongar heritage importance was further inland, close to the Mount Eliza escarpment and the fresh water spring known as Kennedy&#x27;s Fountain. Ultimately the protest was unsuccessful and the development of the property went ahead. The on-site protest had endured for many months and culminated in a bitter but non-violent confrontation with police on 8 January 1990 at which several arrests were made. In August 1992, police had to break through picket lines to allow development work to proceed.

===Usage after redevelopment===
The renovated 1879 building contains a cafe/restaurant and function centre which re-opened in 2001. It also contains a microbrewery which produces malt ales and lagers. There is also a display of historic photographs and artefacts. The site&#x27;s 28 apartments are privately owned. In 2019, Fiveight, the property investment arm of Tattarang, acquired the lease for the Old Swan Brewery from Besen Family Office. The site became the headquarters of Tattarang and Andrew Forrest&#x27;s Minderoo Foundation.

==Canning Vale==
The brewery operation was relocated to a large, fully automated factory at Canning Vale in 1978 where it produced local brands such as Swan and Emu, as well as external brands Tooheys and Hahn. It had its own railway spur constructed, where beer was loaded for transport to the Eastern Goldfields. The Canning Vale complex was officially opened by the then Premier, Sir Charles Court in March 1979. During the mid-1980s, the company became part of the empire of the failed tycoon Alan Bond. It was then acquired by Lion Nathan, a multinational brewing concern distributing many different beers in the Asia-Pacific area. Products that were historically Swan brands include Swan Lager, Emu Bitter and Emu Export. In 2012 Lion Nathan announced that it would cease its brewing operations in Canning Vale and transfer production interstate. The site was developed by Linc Property (which then merged with Fini Group to form Hesperia), in co-venture with Lion Nathan into an industrial land precinct. Known as the Swan Brewery Industrial Estate, the final stage has sold out.

<text>The Gwion Gwion rock paintings, Gwion figures, Kiro Kiro or Kujon (also known as the Bradshaw rock paintings, Bradshaw rock art, Bradshaw figures and the Bradshaws) are one of the two major regional traditions of rock art found in the north-west Kimberley region of Western Australia. Key traditional owners have published their own account of the meaning of the images. However the identity of the artists and the age of the art are contended within archaeology and amongst Australian rock art researchers. A 2020 study estimates that most of the anthropomorphic figures were created 12,000 years ago, based on analysis of painted-over wasps&#x27; nests. These aspects have been debated since the works were seen, and recorded, in 1891 by pastoralist Joseph Bradshaw, after whom they were named until recent decades. As the Kimberley is home to many traditional owners, the rock art is referred to and known by many different names in the local languages, the most common of which are &quot;Gwion Gwion&quot; or Kiro Kiro/&quot;Giro Giro.&quot; The art consists primarily of human figures ornamented with accessories such as bags, tassels and headdresses.

==Gwion Gwion art==
Amateur archaeologist Grahame Walsh began work there in 1977 and returned to record and locate new sites up until his death in 2007. The results of this work produced a database of 1.5 million rock art images and recordings of 1,500 new rock art sites. He expanded his records by studying superimposition and style sequences of the paintings to establish a chronology that demonstrated that Gwion Gwion art is found early in the Kimberley rock art sequence. He proposed that the art dated to a period prior to the Pleistocene. Many of the ancient rock paintings maintain vivid colours because they have been colonised by bacteria and fungi, such as the black fungus, &quot;Chaetothyriales.&quot; The pigments originally applied may have initiated an ongoing, symbiotic relationship between black fungi and red bacteria.

Based on stylistic characteristics, Walsh categorised two individual styles of Gwion paintings, which he named &quot;Tassel&quot; and &quot;Sash&quot; for dominant clothing features. He also identified two variants, which he named &quot;Elegant Action figures&quot; and &quot;Clothes Peg figures&quot;.

*Tassel figures: identified by their characteristic tassels hanging from their arms and waists, various other accessories can be recognised, such as arm bands, conical headdresses and boomerangs. This style is the earliest, most detailed and largest.
*Sash: while similar in appearance to the Tassel figures, the Sash body is depicted more robustly and the accoutrements depicted are slightly different: a three-pointed sash or bags attached to the figures&#x27; belts begin to be shown.
*Elegant Action figures: quite different from the Tassel and Sash figures, these figures are almost always shown running, kneeling or hunting with multi-barbed spears and boomerangs. These are difficult to place in the style sequence as they are the only figures that are not superimposed over a painting from another period. Also, no other style is superimposed over them and they are the only style that has not been defaced. Stylistically, they are believed to fall between the Sash and Clothes Peg figures.
*Clothes Peg figures: were named by Walsh after their resemblance to old wooden clothes pegs, but they are also referred to as &quot;Straight Part Figures&quot; by Welch. These figures are depicted in a stationary pose and painted with red pigment. Segments of their bodies are missing, such as their waists, arms and feet, the result of different colour pigments, such as whites and yellows, fading over time. The material culture depicted with these figures includes multi-barbed spears, spear-throwers, and woven bags. This is the most recent style. The anatomical detail common in the earlier styles is missing, and many of the images are shown in aggressive stances. At least one panel shows a battle with opponents arrayed in ranks opposite each other.

The distribution and stylistic range of these paintings is quite distinctive, and contrasts with the Wandjina tradition. While more common in some areas, such as the sandstone regions of the west and central Kimberley, isolated examples have also been found in several scattered locations in the east, such as the Napier Ranges, and at the far eastern border of the Kimberley. The art is primarily painted where a suitable rock shelter is found; in contrast with Wandjina art, which has a limited distribution restricted to isolated sites. Unlike Wandjina, Gwion Gwion art is rarely found on ceilings, rather vertical rock surfaces are used, high up in escarpments in shallower rock shelters with small overhangs and with irregular rocky floors not suitable for occupation.
The Gwion Gwion paintings predominantly depict human silhouette figures that appear to be suspended in the air or in a dynamic style that suggests running, hunting or dancing. While gender is rarely portrayed in the paintings, limb, arm and shoulder muscles are often well defined in addition to stomach paunches. The question of gender representation in Gwion Gwion art was illuminated recently by the discovery that figures are depicted as if they are facing into the rock face. This perspective has been overlooked until now because of the Western bias toward images that &quot;face out&quot;, but also because the &quot;facing in&quot; perspective is more evident in depictions with excellent delineation of body contours, such as the rare Classic Realistic style, which is also earliest in superposition studies. If one appreciates the &quot;facing in&quot; perspective, it becomes evident that the many attributions of &quot;paunches&quot; are incorrect, both because they can now be seen to be located at the rear of these figures, but also because it is anatomically incorrect to attribute the belly to gluteal structures located more inferiorly. Furthermore, the figures are ornamented with a diversity of objects such as belts, headdresses, bags and tassels, while other material culture is sometimes depicted, such as boomerangs and wands. While Bradshaw initially described the colour of the art as having shades of pale blue and yellow, most figures have a deep purple-red hue, mulberry colour or a red to yellow-brown colour. However, Donaldson notes that there are rare examples of multi-coloured figures that retain some yellow and white pigment. The height of the art is variable; most are between in length with some examples up to in height.

Artistically, Gwion Gwion are unusually advanced both in technique and style. Image processing has revealed that the outline of the figures are often painted first, then filled in. Engraving in the rock often follows the outlines of figures and may have served as a preliminary sketch which implies planning. Some faces of the figures are painted with anatomically correct features with enough detail to be considered portraits. Due to the fine detail and control found in the images, such as strands of hair painted in thicknesses of , it has been suggested that feather quills may have been used as a technique to apply the paint to the rock walls; an imprint of a feather found at one site may support this possibility. No evidence has yet been found of any corrections or changes in composition during or after painting, while evidence of restoration has been found. In a detailed study of 66 panels, approximately 9% of the images have clearly been vandalized. Some were scratched with stones, some damaged by thrown stones, and some have been broken by hammering with large rocks.

With the exception of Elegant Action figures which have been left undamaged for unknown reasons, all Gwion Gwion paintings exhibit possible vandalism, which may indicate ritual mutilation or defacing. Superpositioning of images, another form of vandalism, is common throughout the Kimberley.

==Dating==
The Gwion Gwion are not the region&#x27;s earliest paintings. The earlier art consists of crude animal drawings that are believed to be up to 40,000 years old. The Gwion Gwion have nothing in common with this earlier art and first appeared following the peak of the most recent Pleistocene glacial maximum, which is dated between 26,500 and 20,000 years ago.

Since the mid-1990s, scientific dating methods have been used to determine the ages of the Gwion Gwion paintings. The methods have included accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating (AMS) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). This was used when mud wasp nests have been built over paintings, and it gives a minimum age rather than an actual age of the painting. The results of this have revealed some inconsistency with Walsh&#x27;s chronology. Experimental OSL dates from a wasp nest overlaying a tassel Gwion Gwion figure has given a Pleistocene date of 17,500±1,800 years BP. The academic community generally accepts 5,000 BP for the end of the artistic style. If the date ranges are correct, this may demonstrate that the Gwion Gwion tradition was produced for many millennia. Geoarchaeologist, Alan Watchman posits that the red paint used on a tasselled Gwion Gwion image near the Drysdale River is &quot;likely to be only about 3,000 years old.&quot; Using the AMS results from accreted paint layers containing carbon associated with another figure, gives a date of 3,880 BP making Gwion Gwion art contemporaneous with, and no older than, Wanjina art. Around 15,000 years ago, the archaeological record shows that Aboriginals in the Kimberleys began using stone points in place of multi-barbed spears, but there is no record of this change of technology in the Gwion Gwion paintings. The most recent paintings still depict the use of multi-barbed spears.

In 2008, rock art depicting what is thought to be a &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; was discovered on the north-western coast of the Kimberley. This represented only the second example of megafauna depicted by the Indigenous inhabitants of Australia. The image has a &quot;clothes peg&quot; Gwion Gwion superimposed over the thorax, while a &quot;Tassel&quot; Gwion Gwion crosses the forearm of the animal. In 2009, a second image was found that depicts a &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; interacting with an &quot;elegant action&quot; Gwion Gwion who is in the act of spearing or fending the animal off with a multibarbed spear. Much smaller and less detailed than the 2008 find, it may depict a thylacine, however, the comparative size and morphology indicates a &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; is more likely, a position supported by palaeontologists and archaeologists who have examined the image. As the &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; is believed to have become extinct 45,000–46,000 years ago, this suggests a similar age for the associated Gwion Gwion art. Archaeologist Kim Akerman however believes that the megafauna may have persisted later in wetter areas of the continent as suggested by Wells, and has suggested an age of 15,000 to 22,000 years for the paintings.

Recent advances in dating methods may shed light on the age of the paintings and gain a more accurate result. Neuroscientist Jack Pettigrew has proposed dating the art by using DNA sequencing extracted from colonies of microorganisms which have replaced the pigment in some paintings.

==Indigenous knowledge==
Research undertaken in relation to Aboriginal knowledge has also increased. This has primarily been seen in Aboriginal names being applied to the paintings, reflecting the specific Aboriginal languages used in the areas where they are found. For example, the Ngarinyin name for the art is &quot;Gwion Gwion&quot;. Other terms include &quot;giro giro&quot; used by Aboriginal people in the Napier, Broome Bay and Prince Regent River. Australian rock art researcher David Welch notes that these words are probably different regional accents of &quot;Kujon,&quot; the name of the bird found in the creation story originally heard by Schultz in 1938. Aboriginal people are also more open in telling foreigners stories regarding the images. These stories often relate to spirits who created dances which are still performed today and feature similar apparel found in the paintings, such as headdresses, boomerangs and string. &quot;Bradshaws (Gwion Gwion)&quot; are also depicted in contemporary art works produced for sale in the Kimberley; one notable &quot;Gwion Gwion&quot; artist is Kevin Waina.

==Colonial discovery and study==
Rock art in the Kimberley region was first recorded by colonial explorer and future South Australian governor, George Grey as early as 1838. This rock art is now known as Wandjina style art.

While searching for suitable pastoral land in the then remote Roe River area in 1891, pastoralist Joseph Bradshaw documented an unusual type of rock art on a sandstone escarpment. Bradshaw recognised that this style of painting was unique when compared to the Wandjina style. In a subsequent address to the Victorian branch of the Royal Geographical Society, he commented on the fine detail, the colours, such as brown, yellow and pale blue, and he compared it aesthetically to that of Ancient Egypt.

American archaeologist Daniel Sutherland Davidson briefly commented on the figures while undertaking a survey of Australian rock art that he would publish in 1936. Davidson noted that Bradshaw&#x27;s encounter with this art was brief and lacked any Aboriginal interpretations; furthermore, as Bradshaw&#x27;s sketches of the art were at this time the only visual evidence, Davidson argued that they could be inaccurate and possibly drawn from a Eurocentric bias. The figures and their existence as an artistic tradition was questioned; articles and books on these works were not published until the 1950s. The rediscovery of the original mural after more than a century has shown that Bradshaw had a remarkable gift for reproduction without photography, and that Davidson&#x27;s criticisms were unfounded in the absence of the original. With the growth of anthropological interest in Peninsula region, research in the coastal area brought with it an awareness of Aboriginal art and culture. However, attention to the Gwion Gwion art was sporadic. Several researchers who encountered the Gwion-type of paintings during expeditions to the region were members of the 1938 Frobenius Institute expedition. Agnes Schultz noted that unlike with Wandjina art, Aboriginal people showed little interest in the Gwion Gwion paintings, although they recognised them as depictions of bush spirits or D&#x27;imi.

When pressed, the expedition&#x27;s Aboriginal guide explained their creation:
Anthropologist Robert Layton notes that researchers such as Ian Crawford, who worked in the region in 1969, and Patricia Vinnicombe, who worked in the region in the 1980s, were both told similar creation stories regarding the Gwion-type art.
Since 1980, more systematic work has been done in an effort to identify more Gwion Gwion rock art sites in the Kimberley.

===Research===

The fossil record of climate and vegetation at the last glacial maximum is sparse, but still clear enough to provide an overview. When the Kimberley region was first occupied circa 40,000 years ago, the region consisted of open tropical forests and woodlands. After around 10,000 years of stable climatic conditions, temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger, leading to the beginning of an ice-age. During the glacial maximum, 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, the sea level was some below its present level, with the coastline extending further to the north-west. Australia was connected to New Guinea, and the Kimberley was separated from southeast Asia (&quot;Wallacea&quot;) by a strait approximately wide. Rainfall decreased by 40% to 50% depending on region, while the lower levels (half pre-industrial levels) meant that vegetation required twice as much water to photosynthesize. The Kimberley region, including the adjacent exposed continental Sahul Shelf, was covered by vast grasslands, while woodlands and semi-arid scrub covered the shelf joining New Guinea to Australia. Southeast of the Kimberley, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to northern Tasmania the land, including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves, was covered by extreme deserts and sand dunes. It is believed that no more than 15% of Australia supported trees of any kind. While some tree cover remained in the southeast of Australia, the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi-arid savannah. Tasmania was covered primarily by cold steppe and alpine grasslands, with snow pines at lower altitudes. There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time. It appears there were scattered &quot;refugia&quot; in which the modern vegetation types and human populations were able to survive. With the end of the ice-age, the Kimberley region settled into a tropical monsoon climate until a major El Niño–Southern Oscillation event in the mid Holocene caused the Australian summer monsoon rains to weaken or fail for some 1,500 years.

The discontinuity in artistic styles between the earlier Gwion Gwion and the current Wandjina has been attributed to the severe drought phase that followed the collapse of the wet season in 5,500 BP. The Gwion Gwion style art ended around this time, possibly within 500 years. The emergence of Wandjina art depicting cloud and rain spirits 3,800 to 4,000 years ago coincides with the end of the &quot;mega-drought&quot; and a return of the rain which gave the region its current climate. The research paper&#x27;s lead author, Hamish McGowan, suggests further investigation into the resulting cultural collapse and the possibility that another ethnic group supplanted the Gwion Gwion artists. The chair in Kimberley rock art at the University of Western Australia Peter Veth criticised the research paper for claiming that simultaneous changes in climate patterns and art styles indicates the collapse of a culture. Veth suggested that a climate change coinciding with the change from Gwion Gwion to Wandjina art is coincidence, pointing out that the archaeology of the Kimberley does not show a break in occupation, and that stylistic changes in Aboriginal art have occurred elsewhere in Australia. Additionally, the migration of a new ethnic group into the area is unsupported by the linguistics.

==Controversies==
Research concerning Gwion Gwion art is controversial and little consensus has been reached. Debate has primarily concerned Walsh&#x27;s interpretations regarding the origins, dating and ethnicity of the Gwion Gwion artists, and his rejection of Aboriginal people as being their descendants. The implications of his interpretations generated considerable criticism beginning in the mid-1990s due to its continuing potential to undermine native title claims in the Kimberley. The ongoing disagreements regarding the age of the art and debate about whether it was created by non-Indigenous people makes Gwion Gwion rock art one of Australian archaeology&#x27;s most contentious topics.

===Exotic or local artists===
According to Walsh, Gwion Gwion art was associated with a period he called the &quot;Erudite Epoch&quot;, a time before Aboriginal people populated Australia. He suggested that the art may be the product of an ethnic group who had likely arrived in Australia from Indonesia, only to be displaced by the ancestors of present-day Aboriginal people. Walsh based this interpretation on the sophistication of Gwion Gwion art when compared to other art in the Kimberley region, such as the much later Wandjina styles.

Media coverage has at times emphasised his claims of mysterious races. Pettigrew suggests that the Gwion Gwion paintings depict people with &#x27;peppercorn curls&#x27; and small stature that characterise San groups; he speculates that African people travelled, shortly after the Toba eruption some 70,000 years ago, by reed boat across the Indian Ocean, provisioning themselves with the fruit of the baobab tree. The Australian archaeological community has generally not accepted such claims and believes that Gwion Gwion are indigenous works. For example, Dr Andrée Rosenfeld argued that the aesthetics of the art did not support claims for a non-Aboriginal origin when comparison is made to the aesthetic value of contemporary Aboriginal art. The Australian Archaeological Association in a press release stated, &quot;No archaeological evidence exists which suggests that the early colonisation of Australia was by anyone other than the ancestors of contemporary Aboriginal people&quot;, the release quoted Claire Smith: &quot;such interpretations are based on and encourage racist stereotypes&quot;.

Aboriginal people also criticised Grahame Walsh, arguing that he failed to hear their explanations of the significance that the paintings had in their culture. Crawford records being told by an Aboriginal elder in 1969 that the Gwion Gwion were &quot;rubbish paintings&quot;, a quote that Walsh would repeat continually in support of his own theory that the art was not of Aboriginal origin. In the local Indigenous English, &quot;rubbish&quot; is an adjective usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is &quot;not dangerous,&quot; for example, non-venomous snakes are all considered to be &quot;rubbish&quot; while in contrast, venomous snakes are all &quot;cheeky.&quot;

Scholars have generally rejected the idea that Gwion Gwion art was painted by anyone other than Aboriginal people. Statistical analysis undertaken by Michael Barry has concluded that the Gwion Gwion art shares no stylistic attributes with prehistoric figurative art overseas. Moreover, Barry argues that stylistically, Gwion Gwion art has more in common with art found elsewhere in Australia, such as figures painted in Arnhem Land. Some popular historians and amateur researchers have continued to suggest exotic origins for the Gwion Gwion rock paintings, although these interpretations are considered fringe by reviewers.

===Depictions of shamanistic rituals===
In many cases, Tassel and Sash figures appear to be involved in either dancing, ecstatic behaviour, or both which, according to a study by Michaelson &quot;et al.,&quot; may represent shamanistic rituals or creation ceremonies. Eucalyptus leaves (which can be used as a psychoactive drug) are commonly depicted with Tassel and Sash figures that appear to be in motion.

Michaelson &quot;et al.&quot; cited studies by A. P. Elkin in which he argued that Aboriginal and Tibetan shamanism have markedly close similarities. He also noted that the worldwide pattern of shamanism suggests a common heritage that radiated outward from North Africa about 50,000 years ago; it may have originated as a woman&#x27;s role which over time has been taken over by men. Aboriginal women in Australia have explicitly been recorded as saying that men had taken over roles they once performed in ceremonies. This is supported by many completely different languages having a similar word for women shamans (e.g., udaghan, udagan, utygan), while the term for male shamans is distinct in each language. Michaelson considered it significant that while few women are depicted in Gwion Gwion art, Tassel figures which appear to be leading ceremonies (the oldest art) clearly have breasts, in contrast to later art which depicts males in the leading roles. Pettigrew identifies elements of Gwion Gwion art with symbols used by Sandawe artists to convey their experience with hallucinogens, and others that seem to show hallucinatory elements. From this he infers that psilocybin-induced trances were a feature of both cultures.

However, only a small number of researchers believe that shamanism has been part of the culture of Indigenous Australians. George Chaloupka, an expert on Indigenous Australian rock art, puts it bluntly, &quot;Shamaniacs rule the world at present...It&#x27;s just another orthodoxy basking in its five minutes of sunshine.&quot; Grahame Walsh considered the idea of women shamans in the Gwion Gwion culture &quot;preposterous&quot;. Pointing out that women Gwion Gwion images tend to have extremely prominent breasts, Walsh says that the smaller breasts identified by Michaelson are probably chest-band decorations.

===Destruction===
Aerial fire-bombing and back burning by the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife and the Department of Fire and Emergency Services since 2009 as part of the government&#x27;s fire prevention strategy has caused paint to peel from over 5,000 of the 8,742 known examples of Gwion Gwion art. A survey by archaeologist Lee Scott-Virtue has determined that up to 30 per cent of the rock art had been completely destroyed by fire.

<text>Popular Science (also known as PopSci) is an American popular science website, covering science and technology topics geared toward general readers. &quot;Popular Science&quot; has won over 58 awards, including the American Society of Magazine Editors awards for its journalistic excellence in 2003 (for General Excellence), 2004 (for Best Magazine Section), and 2019 (for Single-Topic Issue). Its print magazine, which ran from 1872 to 2020, was translated into over 30 languages and distributed to at least 45 countries. In 2021, &quot;Popular Science&quot; switched to an all-digital format and abandoned the magazine format in 2023.

==Early history==
&quot;The Popular Science Monthly&quot;, as the publication was originally called, was founded in May 1872 by Edward L. Youmans to disseminate scientific knowledge to the educated layman. Youmans had previously worked as an editor for the weekly &quot;Appleton&#x27;s Journal&quot; and persuaded them to publish his new journal. Early issues were mostly reprints of English periodicals. The journal became an outlet for writings and ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley, Louis Pasteur, Henry Ward Beecher, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Thomas Edison, John Dewey and James McKeen Cattell. William Jay Youmans, Edward&#x27;s brother, helped found &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; in 1872 and was an editor as well. He became editor-in-chief on Edward&#x27;s death in 1887. The publisher, D. Appleton &amp; Company, was forced to sell the journal for economic reasons in 1900.

James McKeen Cattell became the editor in 1900 and the publisher in 1901. Cattell had a background in academics and continued publishing articles for educated readers. By 1915, the readership was declining and publishing a science journal was a financial challenge. In a September 1915 editorial, Cattell related these difficulties to his readers and announced that the &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; name had been transferred to the Modern Publishing Company to start a new publication for general audiences. The existing academic journal would continue publishing under the name &quot;The Scientific Monthly&quot;, retaining existing subscribers. &quot;Scientific Monthly&quot; was published until 1958 when it was absorbed into &quot;Science&quot;.

After acquiring the &quot;Electrician and Mechanic&quot; magazine in 1914, the Modern Publishing Company had merged it with &quot;Modern Electrics&quot; to become &quot;Modern Electrics &amp; Mechanics&quot;. Later that year, they merged the publication with &quot;Popular Electricity and World&#x27;s Advance&quot; to form &quot;Popular Electricity and Modern Mechanics&quot;. After further name changes that caused confusion among librarians, the Modern Publishing Company had purchased the &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; name to provide a clear signifier of the publication&#x27;s focus on popular science.

The October 1915 issue was titled &quot;Popular Science Monthly and World&#x27;s Advance&quot;. The volume number (Vol. 87, No. 4) was that of &quot;Popular Science&quot; but the content was that of &quot;World&#x27;s Advance&quot;. The new editor was Waldemar Kaempffert, a former editor of &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

The change in &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; was dramatic. The old version was a scholarly journal that had eight to ten articles in a 100-page issue. There would be ten to twenty photographs or illustrations. The new version had hundreds of short, easy to read articles with hundreds of illustrations. Editor Kaempffert was writing for &quot;the home craftsman and hobbyist who wanted to know something about the world of science.&quot; The circulation doubled in the first year.

From the mid-1930s to the 1960s, the magazine featured fictional stories of Gus Wilson&#x27;s Model Garage, centered on car problems.

An annual review of changes to the new model year cars ran in 1940 and 1941, but did not return after the war until 1954. It continued until the mid-1970s when the magazine reverted to publishing the new models over multiple issues as information became available.

From 1935 to 1949, the magazine sponsored a series of short films, produced by Jerry Fairbanks and released by Paramount Pictures.

From July 1952 to December 1989, &quot;Popular Science&quot; carried Roy Doty&#x27;s Wordless Workshop as a regular feature.

From July 1969 to May 1989, the cover and table of contents carried the subtitle, &quot;The What&#x27;s New Magazine.&quot; The cover removed the subtitle the following month and the contents page removed it in February 1990. In 1983, the magazine introduced a new logo using the ITC Avant Garde font, which it used until late 1995. Within the next 11 years, its font changed four times (in 1995, 1997, 2001, and 2002, respectively). In 2009, the magazine used a new font for its logo, which was used until the January 2014 issue.

In 2014, the magazine underwent a major redesign; its February 2014 issue introduced a new logo, and a new format featuring greater use of graphics and imagery, aiming to broaden its content to appeal to wider attention to the environment, science, and technology among a mass audience. The revamp concluded in November 2014 with a redesign of the &quot;Popular Science&quot; website.

==Recent history==
The Popular Science Publishing Company was acquired in 1967 by the Los Angeles–based Times Mirror Company. In 2000, Times Mirror merged with the Chicago-based Tribune Company, which then sold the Times Mirror magazines to Time Inc. (then a subsidiary of Time Warner) the following year. On January 25, 2007, Time Warner sold this magazine, along with 17 other special interest magazines, to Bonnier Magazine Group.

In January 2016, &quot;Popular Science&quot; switched to bi-monthly publication after 144 years of monthly publication.

In April 2016 it was announced that editor-in-chief Cliff Ransom would be leaving the magazine.

In August 2016, Joe Brown was named &quot;Popular Science&quot;&#x27;s new editor-in-chief. In September 2018, it was announced that &quot;Popular Science&quot; would become a quarterly publication. During his tenure, &quot;Popular Science&quot; diversified its readership base, was nominated for several National Magazine Awards, winning for The Tiny Issue in 2019, and named to &quot;AdWeek&quot;&#x27;s Hot List in 2019. Brown stepped down in February 2020.

In March 2020, executive editor Corinne Iozzio was named editor-in-chief. During her tenure, the brand moved from a print to a digital-only publication, produced extensive coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, celebrated its 150-year anniversary, and relaunched its &quot;Brilliant 10&quot; franchise. Iozzio and her team won a 2022 National Magazine Award for its &quot;Heat&quot; issue. The issue, an in-depth look at the stark realities and ingenuity of a warming world, was the second win in the Single-Topic Issue category but the first in its new digital-only format. In August 2022, after more than a decade at &quot;Popular Science&quot; and two-and-a-half years leading the brand, Iozzio announced that she would step down as editor-in-chief in October of that year.

On October 6, 2020, the Bonnier Group sold &quot;Popular Science&quot; and six other special interest magazines, including the well-known titles &quot;Popular Photography&quot;, &quot;Outdoor Life&quot;, and &quot;Field &amp; Stream&quot;, to North Equity LLC. While North Equity is a venture equity firm that primarily invests in digital media brands, David Ritchie, CEO of the Bonnier Corp, said Bonnier believes, &quot;North Equity is best-positioned to continue to invest in and grow these iconic legacy brands.&quot; In June 2021, North Equity introduced Recurrent Ventures as the new parent company to its digital media portfolio.

From April 27, 2021, the &quot;Popular Science&quot; publication was changed to a fully digital format and is no longer in physical print. Its digital subscription offering, &quot;PopSci+&quot; is inclusive of exclusive digital content and the magazine.

In January 2023, Annie Colbert was named the new editor-in-chief. She joined the brand after spending more than 10 years at Mashable.

===Radio===
&quot;Popular Science Radio&quot; was a partnership between &quot;Popular Science&quot; and Entertainment Radio Network which ran through 2016.

===Tablet===
On March 27, 2011, &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine sold the 10,000th subscription to its iPad edition, nearly six weeks after accepting Apple&#x27;s terms for selling subs on its tablet.

===Podcasts===
In 2018, &quot;Popular Science&quot; launched two podcasts, &quot;Last Week in Tech&quot; and &quot;The Weirdest Thing I Learned This Week&quot;, &quot;Last Week in Tech&quot; was later replaced by &quot;Techathlon&quot;.

Weirdest Thing proved to be the brand&#x27;s breakout hit. After just one episode, Apple Podcasts included &quot;Weirdest Thing&quot; on their weekly &quot;New &amp; Noteworthy&quot; list, and over the years it has hosted a number of live events.

===&quot;Popular Science+&quot;===
In early 2010, Bonnier partnered with London-based design firm BERG to create Mag+, a magazine publishing platform for tablets. In April 2010, &quot;Popular Science+&quot;, the first title on the Mag+ platform, launched in the iTunes Store the same day the iPad launched. The app contains all the content in the print version as well as added content and digital-only extras. Bonnier has since launched several more titles on the Mag+ platform, including &quot;Popular Photography&quot;+ and &quot;Transworld Snowboarding&quot;+.

===&quot;Australian Popular Science&quot;===
On September 24, 2008, Australian publishing company Australian Media Properties (part of the WW Media Group) launched a local version of &quot;Popular Science&quot;. It is a monthly magazine, like its American counterpart, and uses content from the American version of the magazine as well as local material. Australian Media Properties also launched www.popsci.com.au at the same time, a localised version of the &quot;Popular Science&quot; website.

===Popular Science Predictions Exchange===
In July 2007, Popular Science launched the Popular Science Predictions EXchange (PPX). People were able to place virtual bets on what the next innovations in technology, the environment, and science would be. Bets have included whether Facebook would have an initial public offering by 2008, when a touchscreen iPod would be launched, and whether Dongtan, China&#x27;s eco-city, would be inhabited by 2010. The PPX shut down in 2009.

===Television: &quot;Future Of...&quot;===
Popular Science&#x27;s Future Of... show premiered on August 10, 2009, on the Science Channel. The show was concerned with the future of technology and science in a particular topic area that varies from week to week. As of December 2009, a new episode was premiering every Monday.

===Books===
&quot;Popular Science&quot; has published a number of books, including the bestselling &quot;Big Book of Hacks&quot; and &quot;Big Book of Maker Skills&quot;.

The brand has also published &quot;The Total Inventor&#x27;s Manual&quot; and &quot;The Future Then&quot;, which was published in conjunction with the brand&#x27;s 145th anniversary.

<doc id="816211" wikidata="Q124086" url="?curid=816211" title="Wesley Sneijder">
<text>Wesley Sneijder (; born 9 June 1984) is a Dutch former professional footballer. Due to his playmaking ability, Sneijder was considered one of the best midfielders in the world during his prime.

A product of the Ajax Youth Academy, Sneijder started his professional career playing for Ajax, with whom he won four trophies and was awarded the Johan Cruyff Trophy in 2004. He was sold to Real Madrid for €27 million in 2007, winning La Liga in his first season with the club, and transferred to Inter Milan for €15 million in 2009. At Inter, he won Serie A, the UEFA Champions League, the FIFA Club World Cup, and two Coppa Italia. In 2010, Sneijder was named UEFA midfielder of the season, and one of the three best midfielders in the world by FIFA. After being sold to Galatasaray for €7.5 million in 2013, he helped the club win the Süper Lig in his first season, following with the capture of the Turkish Super Cup, after a 1–0 win against rivals Fenerbahçe. He had brief stint with Nice and Al Gharafa before retiring in 2019.

He appeared for the Netherlands in various youth squads and for the Dutch national team, making his debut in the senior squad in April 2003 at the age of 18. He then represented his country at the FIFA World Cup in 2006; in 2010, when they reached the final; and in 2014; and at the UEFA European Football Championship in 2004, 2008 and 2012. He was awarded the 2010 Bronze Boot, the 2010 Silver Ball, and was named to the team of the tournament for Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup, and as man of the match in six out of eleven games played by the &quot;Oranje&quot; at these two tournaments. With 134 caps, he is the most capped Dutch player of all time. He announced his international retirement in March 2018.

==Early life==
Wesley Sneijder was born in Utrecht into a football family: his father and his older brother Jeffrey were both football players. His younger brother Rodney is currently also a professional football player.

==Club career==
===Ajax===

Sneijder moved to Ajax&#x27;s famous youth academy at age seven after beginning as a youth player with local Utrecht club DOS. Following his older brother&#x27;s footsteps, he signed for Ajax, initially on trial but subsequently impressed enough to be signed on a permanent basis. He first made the bench as an unused substitute for Ajax in a 2–0 win at SBV Excelsior on 22 December 2002 when manager Ronald Koeman, troubled by an injury-filled squad, called him up, advised by Danny Blind, the then-coach of the Ajax youth squad. On 2 February 2003, Sneijder made his official Ajax debut against Willem II in a 6–0 win. He quickly established himself in the first team, starting in the Champions League quarter-final match against A.C. Milan on 23 April 2003.

On 5 March 2003, Sneijder scored his first goal for Ajax in a 4–1 win over FC Groningen in the KNVB Cup. On 13 April, he scored his first Eredivisie goal against NAC Breda in a 3–0 win. He scored three further league goals in wins against Roda JC, RKC Waalwijk and De Graafschap. The following season, he scored nine league goals as Ajax won the 2003–04 Eredivisie title. Sneijder&#x27;s performances saw him awarded the Johan Cruijff Prijs for the season&#x27;s best young player in the Netherlands.

On 14 September 2005, he scored his first Champions League goal in a group match against AC Sparta Praha. Ajax qualified for the knockout stage, with Sneijder scoring again in a 4–2 win over FC Thun.

On 7 May 2006, Sneijder was in the starting line-up for Ajax in the KNVB Cup final, setting up Klaas-Jan Huntelaar&#x27;s opening goal in a 2–1 win over PSV at the De Kuip stadium in Rotterdam.

During the 2006–07 season, Sneijder scored 18 goals in the Eredivisie and 20 goals overall. On 6 May 2007, Sneijder played for Ajax in the final of the KNVB Cup as the team defeated AZ on a penalty shootout.

On 12 August 2007, Ajax agreed to sell Sneijder to Real Madrid for €27 million, according to the club&#x27;s website, making him the second most expensive Dutch football player.

===Real Madrid===

Sneijder was the second of three Dutchmen to sign for Real Madrid during the 2007–08 season, joining Royston Drenthe and Arjen Robben. He also was given the number 23, which had been previously worn by David Beckham for four seasons at Real. In his first La Liga match for Real, he scored the winner in the Madrid Derby against Atlético Madrid. On the second matchday, he scored two goals against Villarreal CF, one coming from a direct free-kick. Sneijder capped a fine first season in Spain by hitting a stunning free-kick in the last game of the season against Levante UD at the Santiago Bernabéu, taking his goal tally to nine in the La Liga season, a season which also saw Real retain their league title.

On 3 August 2008, Sneijder was stretchered off in a pre-season friendly at the Emirates Stadium, against Arsenal with a suspected cruciate ligament injury after a collision with Abou Diaby. Sneijder had an MRI which confirmed the extent of the injury to be not as bad as first feared. It was expected that he would be out for at least three months. He managed, however, to recover in time and was included in the starting XI for the Champions League clash against Juventus in Turin.

On 2 September 2008, &quot;AS&quot; reported that after Robinho&#x27;s departure to Manchester City for €42 million, Sneijder would now be Real Madrid&#x27;s new number 10. One day later, Real Madrid confirmed on their website that Sneijder would wear 10. His previous number, 23, was taken over by his fellow Dutchman and former Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart, whose preferred number is 23.

===Inter Milan===
====2009–10: Treble champions====
On 27 August 2009, Sneijder was bought by Inter Milan from Real Madrid for a reported fee of €15 million. He was given the number 10 shirt and made his debut a day after he signed the contract, making an immediate impact by being on the winning side in the Milan Derby (4–0) against Milan. On 3 October 2009, he scored his first goal in the 92nd minute against Udinese in a 2–1 win. His second goal was scored on 24 October 2009 against Catania, directly from a free kick, and he scored his first Champions League goal for Inter in a dramatic 2–1 group stage win against Dynamo Kyiv in the 89th minute. His next goal was also scored off a hard-swerving free kick in a Coppa Italia game against Livorno.

On 9 January 2010, he scored two stunning free kicks against Siena in the game which Inter won 4–3. On 24 January, he received a straight red card in the Milan derby. On 6 April, Sneijder scored a free kick against CSKA Moscow in the Champions League quarter-final in the sixth minute, to give Inter a 2–0 aggregate win. On 20 April, he scored Inter&#x27;s equalising goal during their Champions League semi-final first leg against defending champions Barcelona. He leveled the game by firing in right-footed from a Diego Milito pass. Inter went on to win the game 3–1 and the tie 3–2 on aggregate. Sneijder was given the nickname &quot;The Sniper&quot; by the media for his ability to deliver perfect passes and score from impressive distances.

On 22 May, Inter won the Champions League Final against Bayern Munich by a score of 2–0. Both goals were scored by Diego Milito, with Sneijder supplying the assist for the first goal. The Champions League was Inter&#x27;s third trophy of the 2009–10 season after winning the Coppa Italia and Serie A titles.

====2010–11: Quintuple and individual success====

Sneijder commenced the 2010–11 season on 21 August 2010 by winning the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana with a 3–1 win over Roma. Five days later, he was named by UEFA as the best club midfielder of the 2009–10 Champions League. The day after, at Monaco&#x27;s Stade Louis II, Inter lost to UEFA Europa League winners Atlético Madrid in the 2010 UEFA Super Cup with Sneijder playing 79 minutes.

He scored his first goal of the season in a 2–2 draw against Twente in the Champions League on 14 September, and followed that up with another goal in Inter&#x27;s second game against Werder Bremen in a 4–0 win at the San Siro on 29 September. On 26 October, Sneijder was shortlisted for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or award, eventually finishing 4th which Barcelona&#x27;s Lionel Messi won. Only two days later, Sneijder signed a five-year contract extension with Inter, tying him to the club until 2015. President Massimo Moratti expressed his delight for the new deal, stating for the club&#x27;s official website: &quot;Sneijder became a key player for Inter last season and will be this year and for many years to come.&quot;

Inter finished second in Group A of the Champions League and were drawn against Bayern Munich (whom they had beaten in the previous season&#x27;s final) in the round of 16. In the first leg, Sneijder and Inter were uninspired and lost 1–0 to a late Mario Gómez goal at the San Siro. On 15 March 2011, Sneijder helped Inter turn it around, scoring in the 63rd-minute leading to a 3–2 win (3–3 on aggregate, Inter progressing on away goals) at the Allianz Arena, booking a place in the quarter-final against Germany&#x27;s Schalke 04. The first leg of that quarter-final ended 5–2 to Schalke. Sneijder also played in the second leg of the tie but could not prevent his team from losing 2–1 and 7–3 on aggregate.

====2011–12: Injury-hit season====
Sneijder begun his third season in Inter colours in strong fashion, netting the opener with a free kick in the 2011 Supercoppa Italiana match against Milan. The match however ended in a 2–1 win for &quot;Rossoneri&quot;. In September, he injured his left thigh during the 3–1 away loss to newcomers Novara.

The Dutchman returned in action one month later, playing 66 minutes against Chievo and assisting Thiago Motta&#x27;s header for a 1–0 win at home, the first of the season. His first championship goal came in the very next game where he scored the opener in an eventual 1–1 draw at Atalanta.

Sneijder suffered another injury later in November 2011 when he damaged his right knee&#x27;s rectus femoris muscle during the warm-up before the start of the match against Cagliari. He was replaced by the youngster Philippe Coutinho who scored in the match. The injury forced Sneijder to miss the rest of 2011, returning in the field on 15 January as a late substitute for goalscorer Diego Milito in the derby victory over Milan.

Sneijder made his 100th Inter appearance on 26 February by playing the first half of a 1–0 defeat to Napoli. He then scored a brace against Udinese at Stadio Friuli to lead his team to a 3–1 win, also marking his first goals since October 2011. Sneijder concluded his third season as Inter playing by making only 20 league appearances, with the injuries making a big impact. The team finished sixth, conceding 55 goals, just five goals short of equalling their all-time worst concession in a single Serie A campaign. In Coppa Italia, he played two times as Inter were eliminated by Napoli, while in Champions League appeared five times in a round of 16 exit by Marseille.

====2012–13: Decline and departure====
Sneijder&#x27;s season begun on 2 August by playing against Hajduk Split in the first leg of 2012–13 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round. He scored the team&#x27;s first goal of the season which contributed in a comfortable 3–0 away win. He was on the score-sheet again twenty-four days later in the season opener against Pescara (3–0).

Sneijder suffered another misfortune on 26 September as he was taken off after 26 minutes in the league game against Chievo. It turned out to be his last appearance for the team as he and the club didn&#x27;t find a mutual agreement for the new contract. Despite recovering from the injury, Sneijder wasn&#x27;t called up in the squad, with president Massimo Moratti describing it as a &quot;technical decision&quot; of the coach. The club offered him a contract running until 2016 with a wage of €6 million plus bonuses to €4 million which Sneijder, who earned around €14,7 million, turned down.

Sneijder left the club officially on 20 January in favour of signing with Turkey&#x27;s Galatasaray, concluding his Inter spell with 116 games and 22 goals, also winning six trophies.

===Galatasaray===

After reportedly falling out of favour with Inter due to contract renewal issues, Sneijder agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal with Turkish giants Galatasaray on 20 January 2013 for a fee of €7.5 million. Thousands of Galatasaray fans welcomed the Dutch international at the Istanbul Atatürk Airport as soon as Sneijder&#x27;s exact arrival time was announced by the club on their official website. Sneijder signed the official contract on 21 January at the Türk Telekom Arena, home of Galatasaray. During the press conference, regarding the questions about Gala legend Gheorghe Hagi, Sneijder said, &quot;He was a legend, and I want to become a legend.&quot; Later, he appeared on the club&#x27;s official TV station Galatasaray TV, where he answered several questions about his transfer to Galatasaray and personal life. He also sent out a message addressing the Galatasaray fans: &quot;Thank you for the support. I&#x27;m really proud, and I will make you guys even more proud. I&#x27;m happy to be here, and I can&#x27;t wait to play my first game for you guys.&quot;

On 27 January, Sneijder made his debut, coming on as a substitute in a 2–1 win against rivals Beşiktaş. Sneijder received a warm reception when he replaced Umut Bulut. He scored his first goal on 25 February in a 4–2 home win against Orduspor, where he produced a finesse shot from the edge of the box, turning the game back on for the home side as Galatasaray were down by two goals.
On 9 April 2013, Sneijder scored Galatasaray&#x27;s second goal in a 3–2 win over his former club Real Madrid in the quarter-final stage of the Champions League. 
On 5 May 2013, Galatasaray beat Sivasspor 2–1 to win the 2012–13 Süper Lig, this gave Sneijder a league title in a fourth different country.

After using the number 14 shirt in his debut season with Galatasaray, Sneijder was given the number 10 shirt previously worn by Felipe Melo for the 2013–14 Süper Lig season following a squad number reshuffle.
On 1 December 2013, when Galatasaray drew with Kasımpaşa Spor Kulübü, Galatasaray manager Roberto Mancini, in response to the question &quot;where is Sneijder?&quot; asked by reporters during a post-match interview answered, &quot;Sneijder has left and I do not know where he has gone,&quot; while Galatasaray&#x27;s official website had earlier informed the media on the reason for Sneijder&#x27;s absence.

On 11 December 2013, Sneijder scored a late winning goal against Juventus in a 1–0 UEFA Champions League win to qualify Galatasaray for the knockout phase. On 2 February 2014, Sneijder scored a hat-trick in Süper Lig encounter against Bursaspor in a 6–0 win.

On 6 April 2014, he scored his first derby goal against rivals Fenerbahçe, in a 1–0 home win. On 7 May 2014, Sneijder played a major part in the Turkish Cup final against Eskişehirspor, scoring the only goal of the game in the 70th minute and receiving the Man of the Match award for his performance.

Sneijder scored ten goals throughout the season during the 2014–15 Süper Lig campaign. By almost single-handedly winning many games for his team, he has been the man in the spotlight for Galatasaray in securing the league title. On 25 May, Sneijder celebrated the championship alongside Gala fans at the front yard of his residence after Başakşehir drew with Fenerbahçe, which brought Galatasaray the triumph. During the official title ceremony, Sneijder sang the famous Gala chant &quot;Don&#x27;t cry Fener&quot; into the microphone in front of 52000 Gala fans.

Since his arrival, Sneijder has become the most efficient agent for the Lions regarding the Fenerbahçe-Galatasaray rivalry. He has scored three goals against Fenerbahçe in league matches in a year, which is more than enough for Galatasaray society to name a player a club legend. In the home game against Fenerbahçe, which was played on matchday 6, Sneijder sent out two long-range rockets in the 88th and 90th minutes, where Galatasaray claimed the victory against their bitter rivals. Overall, he has scored six long-range goals and three free kicks in league and cup games. In his 100th game for Galatasaray, he also scored the only goal against Gençlerbirliği on matchday 32, which helped the Lions stay at the top of the league table for the time being.

In the 2014–15 Turkish Cup, he also helped his team reach the final by providing three goals and three assists. Galatasaray won the final 3–2 against Bursaspor which was held in Bursa Atatürk Stadium on 3 June. Sneijder assisted the first goal off of striker Burak Yılmaz&#x27;s hat-trick.

During Galatasaray&#x27;s 2014–15 UEFA Champions League campaign, where they were knocked out at the group stage, Sneijder scored one goal–a late free kick against Arsenal at home–and made one assist. Sneijder was made vice captain of Galatasaray.

Sneijder began the season scoring the only goal for his team in the 35th Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu, where Galatasaray visited Real Madrid on 18 August. The game ended with a 2–1 victory for Real Madrid.

On matchday 3 of the 2015–16 Süper Lig in which Galatasaray visited Konyaspor, Sneijder scored two goals in the second half and led his team to a 1–4 away win, despite his side being down to ten men after Lionel Carole&#x27;s 67th-minute red card, receiving prior to Sneijder&#x27;s double.

On 3 October, Sneijder signed a three-year contract extension with Galatasaray. He immediately received a €1.3 million signing bonus, and his basic salaries in the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons would be €3.2 million, plus various bonuses.

On 14 July 2017, Sneijder and Galatasaray terminated his contract resulting in him becoming a free agent. Sneijder was reported to have released himself from the contract by buying himself out of the remaining period for €4.5 million

===Nice===
On 7 August 2017, Sneijder joined Ligue 1 side Nice on a free transfer. During his five-month stay at the club, he made 8 appearances and provided one assist to a Mario Balotelli goal in a UEFA Europa League match against Lazio.

===Al-Gharafa===
After getting released by Nice, Sneijder joined Qatari club Al-Gharafa. He made his debut on 12 January 2018, captaining the team and giving an assist in the league 2–1 win over Al Ahli Doha at the Hamad bin Khalifa Stadium.

On 12 August 2019, Sneijder announced his decision to retire from football, and begin working for FC Utrecht.

==International career==
Sneijder made his debut for the Netherlands under-21 side against the Czech Republic on 28 March 2003. His first game with the senior Dutch side was against Portugal on 30 April that same year when he became the eighth-youngest player to play for the Netherlands in the first team&#x27;s history. On 9 June 2017, he became the nation&#x27;s most capped player of all-time when he made his 131st appearance in a 5–0 win over Luxembourg, surpassing the record which had previously held by Edwin van der Sar for 4002 days.

===Euro 2004===
Sneijder reached the UEFA Euro 2004 semi-finals with the Netherlands. He began the competition mainly on the bench, and was subbed into two group stage matches: his team&#x27;s first match against Germany and their third match against Latvia. He had also contributed two goals in the qualifying tournament.

===2006 World Cup===

Sneijder started all four games for the Netherlands at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. He received one of the record 16 yellow cards doled out during the infamous Round of 16 clash with Portugal (titled the &quot;Battle of Nuremberg&quot;) after pushing the Portuguese midfielder Petit to the ground during a brawl between Portuguese and Dutch players; Portugal went on to win 1–0.

===Euro 2008===
In the build-up to Euro 2008, Sneijder scored a free kick in a friendly against Wales on 31 May, making it his second strike from a direct free kick in a row. The game ended 2–0 with a goal from fellow Real Madrid teammate Arjen Robben.

Sneijder marked his 24th birthday in style by scoring one of the goals of the tournament; the second goal in the 31st minute of the Euro 2008 match against the World Cup champions, Italy. Following Giovanni van Bronckhorst&#x27;s goal-line clearance and subsequent run into the Italian half, Sneijder received a headed ball from Dirk Kuyt and volleyed it with an acrobatic strike past Gianluigi Buffon. This brought the score to 2–0 after Ruud van Nistelrooy&#x27;s opener five minutes prior. The match finished with a 3–0 victory to the Dutch after a third goal was scored by van Bronkhorst after another run by him, following a crucial save from Edwin van der Sar. Sneijder&#x27;s goal contributed to the Netherlands&#x27; first victory over Italy in 30 years, which was the biggest defeat Italy had suffered since Sweden beat them by the same margin in 1983. Many fans and pundits agreed that this goal was one of the best of the tournament. On 13 June, he scored another goal for the &quot;Oranje&quot; in the Euro 2008 group stage match against France: in the 92nd minute, from outside the box, Sneijder struck the ball into the corner of the net, bouncing off the crossbar on its way in. The match finished 4–1 for the Netherlands. Although the Dutch lost to the Russians in the quarter-final, Sneijder was named in the Team of the Tournament for his strong performances.

===2010 World Cup===

Sneijder was in the starting line-up for their first match in the competition, a 2–0 victory over Denmark. He scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over Japan. In the first two matches of the group stage at the FIFA World Cup, he was selected as the man of the match in both. In the Netherlands&#x27; round of 16 match against Slovakia, Sneijder scored in a 2–1 victory. He also provided what was at first thought to be an assist for the first goal against Brazil in the quarter-finals, but was later credited with the goal. He then scored the first header of his career direct from a corner and consigned Brazil to a 2–1 defeat, bringing his goal total in the tournament to four. Sneijder was again named man of the match on FIFA&#x27;s website.

In the semi-final against Uruguay, Sneijder scored in the 70th minute, taking his total in the competition to five, raising him at the time to first place in terms of goals scored, along with Spain&#x27;s David Villa. The Netherlands won the match 3–2 and progressed to the final. Sneijder was yet again named on FIFA&#x27;s website as the Budweiser man of the match according to the public online vote. In the World Cup Final, the Dutch lost to Spain 1–0 after extra time, conceding the only goal of the match after 116 minutes to Andrés Iniesta.

===Euro 2012===
For Euro 2012, the Netherlands were in Group B, also known as the &quot;group of death,&quot; alongside Portugal, Germany, and Denmark. Sneijder was deployed as an attacking midfielder as the Netherlands lost 1–0 and 2–1 to Denmark and Germany, respectively. Against Portugal, they lost again 2–1, with Sneijder playing on the left wing to see the Netherlands have an early exit from Euro 2012.

===2014 World Cup===
In August 2012, after the retirement of Mark van Bommel, Sneijder was named as captain of the Netherlands. Less than a year later, however, he was replaced with Robin van Persie by coach Louis van Gaal.

Sneijder was named in the Netherlands&#x27; squad for the 2014 World Cup and made his 100th international appearance in the team&#x27;s opening match, a 5–1 demolition of world champions Spain on 13 June. In the round of 16, Sneijder scored an 88th-minute equaliser, as the Netherlands recovered from a 0–1 deficit to overcome Mexico 2–1 in Fortaleza.

In the quarter-final, Sneijder scored the Netherlands&#x27; third penalty kick in a 4–3 penalty shootout defeat of Costa Rica. The semi-final match against Argentina was also decided by a shootout, with Sneijder one of two Netherlands players to have his kick saved by goalkeeper Sergio Romero in a 4–2 defeat. Sneijder was originally part of the Dutch starting line-up in the bronze game against Brazil, but he was replaced by Jonathan de Guzmán after an injury during the pre-match warm-up prevented him from playing.

===Later years===
Sneijder appeared in all of the 10 matches of the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign and in six of the 2018 FIFA World Cup campaign, which both ended in failure for the Netherlands. He announced his retirement from international football on 4 March 2018, holding a record 133 appearances for the national team. He made his 134th and final international appearance in a friendly match against Peru, at the Johan Cruyff Arena, on 6 September 2018; the match ended in a 2–1 home victory for the Dutch.

==Style of play==
A creative and versatile midfielder, Sneijder was recognised as one of the classic playmakers of the 2010s. From his impeccable placement and confirmed ability to score from free kicks, Sneijder earned the reputation as a dead-ball specialist. Because of his short stature, he was quick and strong on the ball, and his passing range was enhanced by his ambidexterity; he was also renowned for his powerful striking ability from long range, with either foot. In addition to his vision and ability to create chances for teammates, Sneijder was also noted for his intelligence and great technical ability. Although he began his career in his preferred role as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards, he was capable of playing in several midfield positions and was also deployed on the wings or on occasion even up front as a second striker or main striker; in later seasons, he was usually played in the centre, as a deep-lying playmaker, due to his ability to dictate the tempo of his team&#x27;s play in midfield with his passing, although he had stated that he did not favour this position. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he was also deployed in a new role which was later described as a false-10 or central winger, due to Sneijder&#x27;s tendency to drift from the centre into a wide position when in possession of the ball. Despite his talent he also drew criticism at times for his limited defensive work-rate as well as his lack of pace, and was also known to be prone to injury.

==Personal life==
Sneijder has been married to Dutch-Spanish actress and presenter Yolanthe Cabau van Kasbergen since July 2010, although the couple are no longer together; he has two sons, one of them from his first marriage. Inspired by his wife and by Inter teammate Javier Zanetti, Sneijder converted to Roman Catholicism and was baptized in Milan.

Sneijder has two brothers: Jeffrey, a former footballer, and Rodney, a former Eredivisie player who now plays for DHSC, an amateur club from Utrecht. In May 2008, it was reported that Sneijder had blocked a summer transfer of Rodney to his own club at the time, Real Madrid. Wesley Sneijder said, &quot;Real Madrid wanted him and Rodney was very happy about that. But when I heard [of it], I stopped the discussions. I am not in favour of juniors increasingly going to top clubs. I&#x27;ve told him that he first must make a breakthrough at Ajax.&quot;

During an interview in a radio station in Thessaloniki, Sneijder&#x27;s brother Rodney confirmed that he and Wesley Sneijder (along with their other brother Jeffrey) have part-Greek descent, since their paternal grandmother was a Greek woman born in Kavala who moved to Utrecht before World War II.

==Awards==
In October 2008, Dutch magazine &quot;Voetbal International&quot; conducted a poll to decide who was the best Dutch free kick taker. Sneijder received an overwhelming 70% of the votes, while Robin van Persie came second with 21% and striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was third with 3% of the vote. He was voted as the best player of the 2009–10 season by Goal.com.

<text>Military occupation, also called belligerent occupation or simply occupation, is temporary hostile control exerted by a ruling power&#x27;s military apparatus over a sovereign territory that is outside of the legal boundaries of that ruling power&#x27;s own sovereign territory. The controlled territory is called &quot;occupied&quot; territory, and the ruling power is called the &quot;occupant&quot;. Occupation&#x27;s intended temporary nature distinguishes it from annexation and colonialism. The occupant often establishes military rule to facilitate administration of the occupied territory, though this is not a necessary characteristic of occupation.

The rules of occupation are delineated in various international agreements—primarily the Hague Convention of 1907, the Geneva Conventions, and also by long-established state practice. The relevant international conventions, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and various treaties by military scholars provide guidelines on topics concerning the rights and duties of the occupying power, the protection of civilians, the treatment of prisoners of war, the coordination of relief efforts, the issuance of travel documents, the property rights of the populace, the handling of cultural and art objects, the management of refugees, and other concerns that are highest in importance both before and after the cessation of hostilities during an armed conflict. A country that engages in a military occupation and violates internationally agreed-upon norms runs the risk of censure, criticism, or condemnation. In the contemporary era, the laws of occupation have largely become a part of customary international law, and form a part of the law of war.

Since World War II and the establishment of the United Nations, it has been common practice in international law for occupied territory to continue to be widely recognized as occupied in cases where the occupant attempts to alter—with or without support or recognition from other powers—the expected temporary duration of the territory&#x27;s established power structure, namely by making it permanent through annexation (formal or otherwise) and refusing to recognize itself as an occupant. Additionally, the question of whether a territory is occupied or not becomes especially controversial if two or more powers disagree with each other on that territory&#x27;s status; such disputes often serve as the basis for armed conflicts in and of themselves.

== Occupation and the laws of war ==
A dominant principle that guided combatants through much of history was . Emer de Vattel, in The Law of Nations (1758), presented an early codification of the distinction between annexation of territory and military occupation, the latter being regarded as temporary, due to the natural right of states to their . According to Eyal Benvenisti&#x27;s The International Law of Occupation, Second Edition (2012), 

The Hague Convention of 1907 codified these customary laws, specifically within &quot;Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot; (Hague IV); 18 October 1907: &quot;Section III Military Authority over the territory of the hostile State&quot;. The first two articles of that section state:

Art. 42.&lt;br&gt;
Territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army.&lt;br&gt;
The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised.
Art. 43.&lt;br&gt;
The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.
In 1949 these laws governing the occupation of an enemy state&#x27;s territory were further extended by the adoption of the Fourth Geneva Convention (GCIV). Much of GCIV is relevant to protected civilians in occupied territories and is a specific section covering the issue. Under GCIV, protected civilians in general are:

* those . This generally refers to civilians of an enemy state, including refugees, and stateless persons.

* neutral citizens in occupied territory regardless of diplomatic status

* refugees of the occupying power prior to hostilities who cannot be arrested, prosecuted, or deported from occupied territory except for crimes committed after the conflict or beforehand which are also crimes under the law of the occupied state that would permit peacetime extradition as defined under 

Nationals of an enemy state not a signatory or acceded to GCIV are not protected by it. Neutral citizens who are in the home territory of a belligerent nation if their country of origin has diplomatic ties or elsewhere outside occupied territory are not protected. Nationals of a co-belligerent (allied) state which holds diplomatic ties with a belligerent nation are excluded from protection in both locations.

On whether the definition of military occupation applies to anywhere else, the 2023 United States Department of Defense (DOD)&#x27;s &quot;Law of War Manual&quot; states The DOD&#x27;s statement is consistent with the definitions provided by Article 42 of the 1907 Fourth Hague Convention and Article 4 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

 of GCIV restricts the length of time that most of the convention applies:

The present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.

In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.

In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: 1 to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.

GCIV emphasised an important change in international law. The United Nations Charter (26 June 1945) had prohibited war of aggression (See articles 1.1, 2.3, 2.4) and GCIV , the first paragraph in Section III: Occupied territories, restricted the territorial gains which could be made through war by stating:

Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.

 prohibits the forced mass movement of protected civilians out of or into occupied state&#x27;s territory:
Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. ... The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.

Protocol I (1977): &quot;Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts&quot; has additional articles which cover occupation but many countries including the U.S. are not signatory to this additional protocol.

In the situation of a territorial cession as the result of war, the specification of a in the peace treaty merely means that the country in question is authorized by the international community to establish civil government in the territory. The military government of the principal occupying power will continue past the point in time when the peace treaty comes into force, until it is legally supplanted.

 is the rule, as stated in &quot;Military Government and Martial Law&quot;, by William E. Birkhimer, 3rd edition 1914.

== Qualification of a territory as occupied ==

Article 42 under Section III of the 1907 Fourth Hague Convention specifies that a This definition does not rely on a subjective perception, but rather on the of the occupant. Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions indicates that the definition applies to , even if no armed resistance is encountered. The form of administration by which an occupying power exercises government authority over occupied territory is called &quot;military government&quot;.

There does not have to be a formal announcement of the beginning of a military government, nor is there any requirement of a specific number of people to be in place, for an occupation to commence. Birkhimer writes:

No proclamation of part of the victorious commander is necessary to the lawful inauguration and enforcement of military government. That government results from the fact that the former sovereignty is ousted, and the opposing army now has control. Yet the issuing such proclamation is useful as publishing to all living in the district occupied those rules of conduct which will govern the conqueror in the exercise of his authority. Wellington, indeed, as previously mentioned, said that the commander is bound to lay down distinctly the rules according to which his will is to be carried out. But the laws of war do not imperatively require this, and in very many instances it is not done. When it is not, the mere fact that the country is militarily occupied by the enemy is deemed sufficient notification to all concerned that the regular has been supplanted by a military government. (p. 61)
== Concept of effective control ==
The survey of the case-law regarding Article 42 of the 1907 Fourth Hague Convention reveals that the duration of effective control by the occupying power and its encounter with insurgents, terrorists or guerrillas that are able to exercise control over certain areas of the country are immaterial to the applicability of the law of occupation and do not alter the legal status of the occupied territory. For example, in 1948 the U.S. Military Tribunal in Nuremberg held that: 

==Self-defence==
== End of occupation and authority shift ==
According to Eyal Benvenisti, occupation can end in a number of ways, such as: .

== Examples of occupations ==

Some examples of military occupation came into existence as an outcome of World War I and World War II:
* Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA), encompassing much of the Middle East during 1917–1920 – separated to French (OETA North) and British (OETA South) domains;
* Allied-occupied Germany (1945–49) in the aftermath of World War II
A number of post-1945 occupations have lasted more than 20 years, such as those of Namibia by South Africa, of East Timor by Indonesia, of Northern Cyprus by Turkey and of Western Sahara by Morocco. One of the world&#x27;s longest ongoing occupations is Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem (1967–present) and the Gaza Strip (1967–present), both Palestinian territories, as well as the Syrian Golan Heights, which was occupied in 1967 and effectively annexed in 1981.

Other prolonged occupations that have been alleged include those of the Falkland Islands/Malvinas, claimed by Argentina, by the United Kingdom (1833–present), of Tibet by PR China (1950), and of Hawaii by the United States (1893). The War Report makes no determination as to whether belligerent occupation is occurring in these cases.

Examples of occupation which took place in the second half of the 20th century include:

* Egyptian occupation of Gaza, 1949/59–1967
* Indian occupation of Goa, followed by its annexation (1961)
* Indonesian occupation of the West New Guinea, followed by its annexation (1963)
* Israeli occupation of the Western Golan Heights (1967–present)&lt;ref name=&quot;A/RES/78/77&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus (1974–present)
* Somali occupation of Ogaden in Ethiopia (1977–1978)
* Indonesian occupation of East Timor, followed by the annexation (1975–1999)
* Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara, followed most areas by its annexation (1975)
* Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, followed by its annexation as the Kuwait Governorate and the Saddamiyat al-Mitla&#x27; District during the Gulf War (1990–1991)

Examples of occupation in the 21st century include:
* Iraq occupied by US during the Iraq War of 2003–2011 (See: Coalition Provisional Authority)
* Ethiopian occupation of Somalia during 2006–2009
* The Russian occupation of Georgia since 1992/2008 (See: Gori and Poti occupied by Russia during the Russo-Georgian War)
* Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War (2014–present):
** Occupation of parts of Donbas region and Crimea in Ukraine by Russia since 2014, followed by its Crimea annexation in 2014 (See: Russian military intervention in Ukraine, War in Donbas)
** Occupations during the Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022–present):
*** Parts of Kharkiv, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv oblasts, followed by partial annexation of occupied areas
*** Former partial occupations of Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Kyiv, Sumy and Zhytomyr oblasts, as well as Snake Island, in early 2022 (See: Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (24 February – 7 April 2022), Snake Island campaign)
* Turkish occupation of northern Syria in support of the Syrian opposition since 2016
* United Arab Emirates takeover of Socotra in 2018 during the Yemeni Civil War

<text>Babanango is a small town located about 58 kilometers north-west of Melmoth in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. Founded in 1904, the town takes its name from the nearby stream and mountain.

==Etymology==

The exact origin of the name &#x27;Babanango&#x27; is uncertain, and many possible origins have been proposed. The commonly accepted version comes from the Zulu words &#x27;baba nango&#x27;. The popular story goes that many years ago a small Buthelezi child got lost on the slopes of the mist-shrouded hill and when an elder brother found him he shouted, &quot;baba, nango&quot;, meaning &quot;Father, there he is&quot;.

==History==
eMakhosini, located in the Mkhumbane Valley on the banks of a tributary of the White Umfolozi River near the town of Babanango, is the site of one of Zulu king King Dingane kaSenzangakhona&#x27;s great royal kraals, UmGungundlovu, where Piet Retief and his Voortrekkers were massacred in 1838. The name &quot;Mgungundlovu&quot; is said to mean &quot;the place of the elephant&quot;, and the name eMakhosini means &quot;At the place of the chiefs&quot;. The settlement of Babanango was originally part of a land grant to European farmers in 1885 by King Dinizulu for their support after his father&#x27;s death the year before.

==Culture==
The town&#x27;s name is the title of the song &quot;Baba Nango&quot; on Juluka&#x27;s sixth album Work For All.

<text>Denison Olmsted (June 18, 1791 – May 13, 1859) was an American physicist and astronomer. Professor Olmsted is credited with giving birth to meteor science after the 1833 Leonid meteor shower over North America spurred him to study this phenomenon.

==Biography==

Olmsted was born June 18, 1791, in East Hartford, Connecticut. In 1813, he graduated from Yale College, where he acted as college tutor from 1815 to 1817. In the latter year, he was appointed to the chair of chemistry, mineralogy and geology in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A gold rush in North Carolina spurred the state legislature to sponsor the first state geological survey that was ever attempted in the United States. Olmsted traveled by horseback across the state collecting minerals and fossils, publishing his geological map in 1825. 

In 1825, he became professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Yale. He published an elaborate theory of hail-stones in 1830, which caused much discussion, but finally received the general approbation of meteorologists. The shower of shooting stars that fell in November 1833 attracted his attention, and he studied their history and behavior until he was able satisfactorily to demonstrate their cosmical origin. Olmsted appears to have been the earliest person to use the word radiator to mean a heating appliance in a patent of 1834 when he wrote that it was &quot;a peculiar kind of apparatus, which I call a radiator&quot;. Olmsted and his associate, Elias Loomis, were in 1835 the first American investigators to observe the Halley&#x27;s Comet.

In 1836, his Yale professorship was divided, and he retained that of natural philosophy, the department of mathematics being assigned to Anthony D. Stanley.
For several years, he carried on a series of observations of the aurora borealis.

Olmsted possessed considerable mechanical talent, which he used in promoting and perfecting the inventions of others, but while he himself frequently invented articles of convenience and comfort, such as the Olmsted stove, he seldom secured his rights by patents.

Olmsted died in New Haven, Connecticut, on May 13, 1859.

== Selected writings ==

Olmsted wrote textbooks on Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, and these sold well. However, he is chiefly known to the scientific world for his observations on hail (1830), meteors and the aurora borealis (see &quot;Smithsonian Contributions&quot;, vol. viii, Washington, 1850). Others: 
* &quot;Student&#x27;s Commonplace Books&quot; (New Haven, 1828)
* &quot;Introduction to Natural Philosophy&quot; (2 vols., New York, 1831)
* &quot;Compendium of Natural Philosophy&quot; (1832)
* &quot;Observations on the Meteors of November 13th, 1833&quot; (1834)
* &quot;Introduction to Astronomy&quot; (1839)
* &quot;Compendium of Astronomy&quot; (1841)
* &quot;Letters on Astronomy, Addressed to a Lady&quot; (1841)
* &quot;Life and Writings of Ebenezer Porter Mason&quot; (New York, 1842)
* &quot;Rudiments of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy&quot; (Cincinnati, 1844)

Olmsted wrote some biographical sketches, one of which became among the most influential writings on Eli Whitney. The &quot;&quot; was first published in the American Journal of Science in 1832, seven years after Whitney&#x27;s death. Details of early biographies differed, with one of the most important differences being the state of practice of cotton ginning at the time of Whitney&#x27;s invention. Olmsted said workers used their fingers to separate seed from cotton, whereas others said roller gins were widely used. Thus, Olmsted said Whitney invented the cotton gin, whereas others credited him with the more modest accomplishment of inventing a new and more efficient kind of gin. Most later biographers, especially after the Civil War, adopted Olmsted&#x27;s version. Meanwhile, authors writing more broadly about the southern United States elaborated on Olmsted&#x27;s ideas, treating the cotton gin as a symbol of nineteenth century prosperity or of the evils of slavery.

<text>Bronisław Geremek (; born Benjamin Lewertow; 6 March 1932 – 13 July 2008) was a Polish social historian and politician. He was an opposition activist in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic and participated in the Polish Round Table Agreement. 

He served as Member of Parliament (1991–2001), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1997–2000), leader of the Freedom Union (2000–2001), as well as Member of the European Parliament (2004–2008). In 2002, he was awarded Poland&#x27;s highest order of merit, Order of the White Eagle.

== Early life and education ==
Bronisław Geremek was born as Benjamin Lewertow in Warsaw on 6 March 1932. His father Boruch Lewertow, a fur merchant, was murdered in Auschwitz. His mother, Sharca, and he were smuggled out of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943 and were sheltered by Stefan Geremek. Stefan Geremek later married Bronisław&#x27;s mother and Bronisław was further raised in a Roman Catholic tradition. In his adult life, he considered himself neither a Jew nor a Catholic. His grandfather was a maggid, his brother Jerry, lived in New York as a Jew, and his sons living in Poland are Roman Catholics.

In 1954, Bronisław Geremek graduated from the Faculty of History at the Warsaw University. In 1956–1958, he completed postgraduate studies at the École pratique des hautes études in Paris. He completed his PhD in 1960 and he was granted a postdoctoral degree at the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) in 1972. He was appointed associate professor in 1989.

The chief domain of Geremek&#x27;s scholarly work was research on the history of culture and medieval society. His scholarly achievements included numerous articles and lectures, as well as ten books, which have been translated into ten languages. His doctoral thesis (1960) concerned the labour market in medieval Paris, including prostitution. His postdoctoral thesis (1972) concerned underworld groups in medieval Paris.

Most of Geremek&#x27;s scholarly career was connected with the Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where he worked from 1955 to 1985. From 1960 to 1965, he was also a lecturer at the Sorbonne in Paris and the manager of the Polish Culture Centre of that university. Geremek was given honorary degrees by the University of Bologna, Utrecht University, the Sorbonne, Columbia University, Waseda University, and Jagiellonian University in Kraków. In 1992, he was designated visiting professor at the Collège de France. He was a member of Academia Europaea, the PEN Club, the Société Européenne de Culture, fellow of Collegium Invisibile and numerous other societies and associations. He was a longtime professor and Chairholder of the Chair of European Civilisation at the College of Europe until his death.

== Political activity ==

=== History of Poland (1945–1989) ===
In 1950, Geremek joined the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR). He was the second secretary of the Basic Party Organisation (POP) of the PZPR at Warsaw University. In 1968, however, he left the party in protest against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

During the 1970s, Geremek was considered one of the leading figures in the Polish democratic opposition. In 1978, he co-founded the Society for Educational Courses, for which he gave lectures. While on a Fellowship at the Wilson Center in Washington DC, he met General Edward Rowny who introduced him to Lane Kirkland and Ronald Reagan. In August 1980, he joined the Gdańsk workers&#x27; protest movement and became one of the advisers of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarność (Polish for &quot;Solidarity&quot;) – NSZZ. In 1981 he chaired the Program Commission of the First National Convention of Solidarity. After martial law was declared in December 1981, he was interned until December 1982, when he once again became an adviser to the then-illegal Solidarity, working closely with Lech Wałęsa. In 1983, he was again arrested by the Polish authorities.

=== History of Poland (1989–2008) ===

==== Polish Round Table Agreement ====
Between 1987 and 1989, Geremek was the leader of the Commission for Political Reforms of the Civic Committee, which prepared proposals for peaceful democratic transformation in Poland. In 1989, he played a crucial role during the debates between Solidarity and the authorities that led to free parliamentary elections and the establishment of the ‘Contract Sejm’.

==== Third Polish Republic ====
Geremek then became one of the founders of The Democratic Union (later merged into The Freedom Union) and was the leader of the Democratic Union&#x27;s parliamentary group from 1990 to 1997. After the elections in 1991, President Lech Wałęsa asked him to form a new government, but Geremek failed to do so and Jan Olszewski was appointed prime minister instead.

From 1989 to 2001, Geremek was a member of the lower house of the Polish parliament, the Sejm, and chairman of the Political Council of the Freedom Union. He chaired the Sejm&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1989 to 1997, its Constitutional Committee from 1989 to 1991 and its European Law Committee from 2000 to 2001.

After a coalition government was formed in October 1997 by the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and the Freedom Union, Geremek served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek until 2000. In 1998, Poland chaired OSCE, and Bronisław Geremek served as Chairperson-in-Office. In March 1999, he signed the treaty under which Poland joined NATO.

=== European Parliament Deputy ===
In the election to the European Parliament in June 2004, Geremek was elected as a candidate of the Freedom Union, winning the largest number of votes in Warsaw. In the European Parliament he was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. He was a believer in the idea of Europe, though he felt that there is a need to create a clear European identity and the need for people to believe in the benefits that Europe can bring to them - not just as nations, but also as individuals.

In April 2007, Geremek refused to declare that he had never collaborated with the Communist secret service, which he was being asked to do under a new vetting law. In May 2007, the Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland rejected most of the new vetting law, including the clause that would have made it mandatory for nearly 700,000 Poles to sign declarations certifying that they had never collaborated with the secret services under the old regime.

From 2006 to 2008, he was president of the Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe. He was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly.

<doc id="816223" wikidata="Q2534315" url="?curid=816223" title="2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak">
<text>The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom in 2001 caused a crisis in British agriculture and tourism. This epizootic saw 2,000 cases of the disease on farms across most of the British countryside. Over 6 million cows and sheep were slaughtered on farms in an eventually successful attempt to halt the disease. Cumbria was the worst affected area of the country, with 893 cases.

With the intention of controlling the spread of the disease, public rights of way across land were closed by order. This damaged the popularity of rural areas such as Wales, Cornwall and the Lake District as tourist destinations and led to the cancellation of that year&#x27;s Cheltenham Festival, as well as the British Rally Championship for the 2001 season and delayed that year&#x27;s general election by a month. Crufts, the international dog show, had to be postponed by 2 months from March to May 2001. By the time that the disease was halted in October 2001, the crisis was estimated to have cost the United Kingdom £8 billion.

== Background ==

Britain&#x27;s last outbreak had been in 1967, and had been confined to a small area of the country. The Northumberland report issued after the 1967 outbreak had identified that speed was the key to stopping a future outbreak, with the recommendation of identified animals being slaughtered on the spot on the same day as identification and the carcasses buried in quicklime.

In 1980, Foot and Mouth Disease treatment policy passed from the hands of the UK Government to the European level as a result of European Community (EC) directive, 85/511. This set out procedures, such as protection and &quot;surveillance zones&quot;, the confirmation of diagnosis by laboratory testing and that actions had to be consulted with the EC and its Standing Veterinary Committee. An earlier directive, 80/68, on the protection of groundwater gave powers to the Environment Agency to prohibit farm burials and the use of quicklime unless the site was authorised by the Agency.

Since the 1967 outbreak, there had also been significant changes in farming methods. Specifically animals were being kept in larger numbers and being housed during the winter. The closure of many local abattoirs meant that animals for slaughter were now being transported greater distances.

==Outbreak==
===Beginnings===

The first case of the disease to be detected was at Cheale Meats abattoir in Little Warley, Essex on 19 February 2001, in pigs from Buckinghamshire and the Isle of Wight. Over the next four days, several more cases were announced in Essex, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) imposed movement restrictions on livestock in and out of eight kilometres around the infected area. On 21 February, the European Commission announced a blanket ban on the export of any meat, milk products, or livestock from the UK.

On 23 February, a case was confirmed in Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, from the same location as the pig in the first case; this farm was later confirmed as the source of the outbreak, with the owner, Bobby Waugh of Pallion, found guilty of having failed to inform the authorities of a notifiable disease and banned from keeping farm animals for 15 years. He was later found guilty of feeding his pigs &quot;untreated waste&quot;.

On 24 February, a case was announced in Highampton in Devon. Later in the week, cases were found in North Wales. By the beginning of March, the disease had spread to Cornwall, southern Scotland and the Lake District where it took a particularly strong hold.
During investigation of the Great Heck rail crash, which took place on 28 February in North Yorkshire, investigators visiting the crash site had to go through a decontamination regimen, to prevent possible contamination of the crash site&#x27;s soil with the virus.

The MAFF adopted a policy of &quot;contiguous cull&quot; – all animals within of known cases would be slaughtered. This was immediately clarified as applying only to sheep, not cows or pigs. The policy of MAFF was that where affected carcasses from the cull could not be disposed on site, they would have to be taken to a rendering plant in Widnes; as such, the corpses of infected animals were taken through disease-free areas.

===Control measures===

By 16 March, the number of cases was at 240. Around the time, the Netherlands had a small outbreak, though the disease was contained by vaccination; the vaccinated animals would later be destroyed, in line with EU requirements on trading.

David King was appointed to approach MAFF policy in a scientific manner, alongside Roy M. Anderson, an epidemiologist who had been modelling human diseases at Imperial College and was on the committee concerned with BSE. By the end of March the disease was at its height, with up to 50 new cases a day.

In April, King announced that the disease was &quot;totally under control&quot;. The effort to prevent the spread of the disease, which caused a complete ban of the sale of British pigs, sheep and cattle until the disease was confirmed eradicated, concentrated on a cull and then by burning all animals located near an infected farm. The complete halt on movement of livestock, cull, and extensive measures to prevent humans carrying the disease on their boots and clothing from one site to another, brought the disease under control during the summer. The culling required resources that were not immediately to hand. With about 80,000–93,000 animals per week being slaughtered, MAFF officials were assisted by units from the British Army commanded by Brigadier Alex Birtwistle, the local regional commander of 42 (North West) Brigade. From May to September, about five cases per day were reported.

===Final cases===
The last case was reported on Whygill Head Farm near Appleby in Cumbria on 30 September. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) downgraded to &quot;high risk&quot; the last area to be denoted &quot;infected&quot; on 29 November. The last cull in the UK was performed on 1 January 2002 on 2,000 sheep at Donkley Woods Farm, Bellingham, Northumberland. Restrictions on livestock movement were retained into 2002.

With no new positive tests, the UK declared itself free of the foot-and-mouth disease on 14 January 2002, officially ending 11 months of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.

==Political effects==
The outbreak caused the delay by a month of the local elections in the UK. Part of the reason was that bringing together so many farmers at polling stations might cause extensive spread of the disease. However, more importantly, it was widely known before the outbreak that the Government had chosen the day of the local elections to hold the general election. Holding a general election during the height of the crisis was widely seen as impossible – Government work is much reduced during the four-week campaign and it was seen as inappropriate to divert attention away from management of the crisis. The announcement was leaked to newspapers at the end of March. Prime Minister Tony Blair confirmed the decision on 2 April. Opposition leader William Hague concurred with the reasons for delay, and even suggested a further delay to ensure that the crisis was truly over (though it was alleged that he was hoping the Tories would be more popular and do better at the coming election the later it took place, perhaps because of bad government handling of the foot and mouth situation). The general election was eventually held on 7 June, along with the local elections. It was the first delay of an election since the Second World War.

Following the election, Blair announced a re-organisation of the government departments. Largely in response to the perceived failure of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to respond to the outbreak quickly and effectively enough, the ministry was merged with elements of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to form the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

==European infections==

Several cases of foot and mouth were reported in Ireland and mainland Europe, following unknowing transportation of infected animals from the UK. The cases sparked fears of a continent-wide pandemic, but these proved unfounded.

The Netherlands was the worst affected country outside the UK, suffering 25 cases. Vaccinations were used to halt the spread of the disease. However, the Dutch went on to slaughter all vaccinated animals and in the end 250,000–270,000 cattle were destroyed, resulting in significantly more cattle slaughtered per infected premises than in the UK.

Ireland suffered one case in a flock of sheep in Jenkinstown in County Louth in March 2001. A cull of healthy livestock around the farm was ordered. Irish special forces sniped wild animals capable of bearing the disease, such as deer, in the area. The outbreak greatly affected the Irish food and tourism industry. The 2001 Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day festival was cancelled, but later rescheduled two months later in May. Severe precautionary measures had been in place throughout Ireland since the outbreak of the disease in the UK, with most public events and gatherings cancelled, controls on farm access, and measures such as disinfectant mats at railway stations, public buildings and university campuses. The 2001 Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, or Irish Dance World Championships, was cancelled this year due to these measures. &quot;Causeway 2001&quot;, an Irish Scouting Jamboree was also cancelled. Three matches involving Ireland in rugby union&#x27;s 2001 Six Nations Championship were postponed until the autumn.

France suffered two cases, on 13 and 23 March.

Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg and Germany carried out some precautionary slaughters, but all tests eventually proved negative. Further false alarms that did not result in any culling were signalled in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Italy. All other European countries imposed livestock movement restrictions from infected or potentially infected countries.

==Investigations==
===Probable source===
The consensus is that the FMD virus came from infected or contaminated meat that was part of the swill being fed to pigs at Burnside Farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall. The swill had not been properly heat-sterilized and the virus had thus been allowed to infect the pigs. 

As the virus was believed to be not present in the UK prior to the outbreak, and given there were import restrictions for meat from countries known to harbour FMD, it is likely that the infected meat had been illegally imported to the UK. Such imports are likely to be for the catering industry and a total ban on the feeding of catering waste containing meat or meat products was introduced early in the epidemic.

In June 2004, Defra held a simulation exercise in five areas around the UK to test new procedures to be employed in the event of a future outbreak. This was in response to findings that showed that in 2001, MAFF had failed to respond quickly enough to stop the high volume of animal movements coming out of the UK&#x27;s livestock markets; without disease testing, infected animals were being quickly moved throughout the British Isles facilitating the spread of the FMD virus. In 2001, the NFU had accused MAFF of acting too slowly in the early stages of the outbreak even though the UK&#x27;s Agriculture Minister claimed as late as 11 March that the outbreak was under control.

===Government inquiries=== 
As the 2001 outbreak seemed to cause as much harm as the previous outbreak in 1967, there was a widespread government and public perception that little had been learnt from the previous epizootic (despite the publication in 1968 of a report, the Northumberland Inquiry, on the previous outbreak). In August 2001 therefore, in an effort to prevent this failure to learn from history from happening again, HM Government launched three inquiries into various aspects of the crisis. They were:
* &quot;Inquiry into the lessons to be learned from the foot and mouth disease outbreak of 2001&quot;. This inquiry was devoted specifically to the government&#x27;s handling of the crisis. It was chaired by Sir Iain Anderson CBE, previously a special adviser to Tony Blair, and reported in July 2002.
* &quot;The Royal Society Inquiry into Infectious Diseases in Livestock&quot;. This inquiry examined the scientific aspects of the crisis, for instance the efficacy of vaccinations, the way the virus spreads and so on. It was chaired by Sir Brian Follett and also reported in July 2002.
* &quot;Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food&quot;. This inquiry focused on the long-term production and delivery of food within the country. It was chaired by Sir Donald Curry and reported in January 2002.

All three inquiries reported their findings to the public. However, the inquiries themselves took place in private. The lack of a full public inquiry into the crisis caused a group of farmers, business leaders and media organisations to lodge an appeal at the High Court against the government&#x27;s decision not to hold such an inquiry. Margaret Beckett, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, had ruled out a public inquiry on the grounds that it would be too costly and take too long. After a four-day hearing, the court sided with Beckett and the Government.

An &quot;Independent Inquiry into Foot and Mouth Disease in Scotland&quot; initiated by the Royal Society of Edinburgh was chaired by Professor Ian Cunningham. This embraced not only the scientific aspects of the outbreak, but also economic, social and psychological effects of the event. The costs to Scottish agriculture of the FMD outbreak were estimated to be £231m and the loss of gross revenue to tourism to be between £200–250m for Scotland as a whole. It recommended that there should be a regional laboratory in Scotland, and priority be given to the development of testing procedures. The delay in imposing a ban of all movements until the third day after confirmation, the use of less than transparent modelling techniques and the failure to call on more than a fraction of the considerable relevant scientific expertise available in Scotland were criticised. The case for emergency protective vaccination, without subsequent slaughter, was supported by the evidence and it was recommended that contingency plans should include emergency barrier, or ring, vaccination as an adjunct to slaughter in clinical cases. Reservations about the consumption of meat and milk from vaccinated animals were seen to be unjustified. The importance of biosecurity at all times and throughout the agricultural industry was emphasised and it stated that SEERAD (The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department) should take the lead in establishing standards to be applied in normal times and at the start of an outbreak. A Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) should be appointed and a &quot;Territorial Veterinary Army&quot; formed from professionals to be called upon should need arise. Burial of carcasses, where conditions permit, was identified as the preferred option for disposal of slaughtered animals. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) should have a clear role in contingency planning and management of any future emergency. There was a need for operational guidelines for slaughtermen. In formulating movement restriction, the dispersed nature of many holdings should be taken into account. There should be a clear and consistent strategy for compensation for slaughtered animals. The closing down of the country initially for no more than three weeks and then reopening in non-affected areas was recommended. Great importance was placed on contingency planning, on the need for regular exercises and on the setting up of an independent standing committee to monitor the maintenance of effective planning. In all, some twenty seven recommendations were made to the Scottish Executive.

The Farm Animal Welfare Council, an independent advisory body established by the Government in 1979, also published a report. Its recommendations including material from both The Royal Society Inquiry into Infectious Diseases in Livestock and the Independent Inquiry into Foot and Mouth Disease in Scotland.

The use of a vaccine to halt the spread of the disease was repeatedly considered during the outbreak, but the government decided not to use it after pressure from the National Farmers Union. Although the vaccine was believed to be effective, export rules would prevent the export of British livestock in the future, and it was decided that this was too great a price to pay, although this was controversial because the value of the export industry (£592 million per year) was small compared to losses to tourism resulting from the measures taken. Following the outbreak, the law was changed to permit vaccinations rather than culling.

==Health and social consequences==
The Department of Health (DH) sponsored a longitudinal research project investigating the health and social consequences of the 2001 outbreak of FMD. The research team was led by Maggie Mort of Lancaster University and fieldwork took place between 2001 and 2003. Concentrating on Cumbria as the area that was worst hit by the epidemic, data has been collected via interviews, focus groups and individual diaries to document the consequences that the FMD outbreak had on people&#x27;s lives. In 2008, a book based on this study was published, titled &quot;Animal Disease and Human Trauma, emotional geographies of disaster&quot;.

<text>Mathieu Joseph Bonaventure Orfila (Catalan: &quot;Mateu Josep Bonaventura Orfila i Rotger&quot;) (24 April 1787 – 12 March 1853) was a Spanish toxicologist and chemist, the founder of the science of toxicology.

== Role in forensic toxicology ==

If there is reason to believe that a murder or attempted murder may have been committed using poison, a forensic toxicologist pharmaceutical is often engaged to examine pieces of evidence such as corpses and food items for poison content. In Orfila&#x27;s time the primary type of poison in use was arsenic, but there were not any reliable ways of testing for its presence. Orfila created new techniques, refined existing techniques and described them in his first treatise, &quot;Traité des poisons&quot; (1813), greatly enhancing their accuracy.

In 1840, Marie Lafarge was tried for the murder of her husband. Although she had had access to arsenic, and arsenic had been found in the victim&#x27;s food, none could be found in the corpse. Orfila was asked by the court to investigate. He discovered that the test used, the Marsh test, had been performed incorrectly, and that there &quot;was&quot; in fact arsenic in the body; LaFarge was subsequently found guilty.

<text>Northumbria University (legally the University of Northumbria at Newcastle) is a public research university located in Newcastle upon Tyne, North East of England. It has been a university since 1992, but has its origins in the Rutherford College, founded in 1877.

Northumbria University is primarily based within City Campus located in Newcastle upon Tyne city centre and at Coach Lane campus on the outskirts of the city centre, London and Amsterdam. It is organised into four faculties—Arts, Design and Social Sciences; Business and Law; Engineering and Environment, and Health and Life Sciences. Northumbria University has approximately 38,300 students.

According to the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, Northumbria University was rated 23rd in the UK for research power (the grade point average score of a university, multiplied by the full-time equivalent number of researchers submitted). This determines how much funding is awarded to universities to spend on research activity and represented the largest percentage-point rise in market share since the previous exercise. The annual income of the institution for 2022–23 was £338.3 million of which £16.4 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £340.2 million.

Northumbria is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, Universities UK and the Wallace Group.

== History ==
Northumbria University has its origins in three Newcastle colleges: Rutherford College of Technology, which was established by John Hunter Rutherford in 1877 and opened formally in 1894 by the Duke of York (later King George V), the College of Art &amp; Industrial Design and the &quot;Municipal College of Commerce&quot;. In 1969, the three colleges were amalgamated to form Newcastle Polytechnic. The Polytechnic became the major regional centre for the training of teachers with the incorporation of the &quot;City College of Education&quot; in 1974 and the Northern Counties College of Education in 1976.

In 1992, Newcastle Polytechnic was reconstituted as the new University of Northumbria, as part of a nationwide process in which polytechnics became new universities. It was originally styled, and its official name still is, the &quot;University of Northumbria at Newcastle&quot; (see the Articles of Government) but the trading name was simplified to &quot;Northumbria University&quot; in 2002. In 1995, it was awarded responsibility for the education of healthcare professionals, which was transferred from the National Health Service.

In 2017, the university was fined £400,000 after a sports science experiment gave volunteers a hundred times the safe dose of caffeine. Two student volunteers were given a dose of 30g instead of 0.3g, because staff conducting the experiment tried to calculate the dose on a mobile phone calculator and misread the decimal point. Both were hospitalised and one reported loss of short-term memory. A court hearing heard that the university had not trained staff in safety and had not carried out a proper risk assessment, and that the dose was above the level known to cause risk of death.

Northumbria was named the UK University of the Year 2022 by Times Higher Education. The award was given in recognition of Northumbria&#x27;s transformation over more than a decade into a research-intensive modern institution. The judging panel stated &quot;The scale of [Northumbria&#x27;s] ambition, the rigour and effectiveness with which it has been pursued and its role in transforming lives and supporting its region all make it a deserving winner.&quot;

== Campuses ==
=== United Kingdom ===

The university has two large campuses situated in Newcastle and one in London. City Campus, located in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne, is divided into City Campus East and City Campus West by the city&#x27;s central motorway and linked by a £4 million bridge which in 2008 was officially opened by the former Minister of State for Trade and Investment, Lord Digby Jones.

==== City Campus ====

City Campus East is home to the Schools of Law, Design and the Newcastle Business School (NBS). NBS and Law are housed in one building, and the School of Design is across a courtyard.

City Campus East, designed by Atkins, opened in September 2007, winning awards from The Journal newspaper and the Low Carbon New Build Project of the Year accolade.

City Campus West is home to the Schools of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, Built &amp; Natural Environment, Computing, Engineering &amp; Information Sciences and Life Sciences. Also located on this campus is the University Library, Students&#x27; Union building and Sport Central, a £31m sports facility for students, staff and the community which opened in 2010.

The Sutherland Building, formerly the Medical School of Durham University, which was a naval warehouse during World War II, and the Dental School of Newcastle University (1945–78) is the home of the University Executive team and new world-class studios for Architecture students, designed by Page\Park architects, which opened in 2019.

==Arms==
The university states &#x27;Northumbria&#x27;s shield contains two triple-towered castles, representing the City of Newcastle upon Tyne, and an open book which represents learning. The arched line of battlements dividing the shield refers to the Roman Wall, a historic feature of Northumberland. Whilst the curve of the arch reflects the King George the Fifth Bridge over the River Tyne, more generally the bridge alludes to the university&#x27;s role in the transmission of knowledge to, and strong links, with the society in which its located.&#x27;
The crest is a lion grasping a flaming torch which is an emblem of learning, also a trident as the emblem of the old god of the River Tyne. The supporters are seahorses referencing the arms of Newcastle upon Tyne but with the addition of crowns around their necks, alluding to the Roman Wall and holding tridents of the River Tyne.

He is best known for his so-called &quot;rusticware&quot;, typically highly decorated large oval platters featuring small animals in relief among vegetation, the animals apparently often being moulded from casts taken of dead specimens. It is often difficult to distinguish examples from Palissy&#x27;s own workshop and those of a number of &quot;followers&quot; who rapidly adopted his style. Imitations and adaptations of his style continued to be made in France until roughly 1800, and then revived considerably in the 19th century.

In the 19th century, Palissy&#x27;s pottery became the inspiration for Mintons Ltd&#x27;s Victorian majolica, which was exhibited at the London Great Exhibition of 1851 under the name &quot;Palissy ware&quot;.

Palissy is known for his contributions to the natural sciences, and is famous for discovering principles of geology, hydrology and fossil formation. A Protestant, Palissy was imprisoned for his belief during the tumultuous French Wars of Religion and sentenced to death. He died of poor treatment in the Bastille in 1589 (1590 according to Burty 1886).

==Early life==
According to his friend Pierre de L&#x27;Estoile, Palissy was born in 1510. The location of Palissy&#x27;s birth is not certain, but it is believed to be either Saintes, Périgord, Limousin or Agen. He lived most of his life in Saintonge. Palissy was born to a poor family, and while his education did not include Greek or Latin, it did instruct him in practical sciences including geometry and surveying. Early in his life, Palissy was commissioned by the crown to survey the salt marshes of Saintonge. In his memoirs, Palissy tells us that he was apprenticed to a glass painter. At the end of his apprenticeship he spent a journeyman year acquiring fresh knowledge in many parts of France, including Guyenne, Languedoc, Provence, Dauphiné, Burgundy and the Loire. He later traveled north to the Low Countries, perhaps even in the Rhine Provinces of Germany, and to Italy.
Palissy returned to Saintonge where he married and had children. Other than what he tells us in his autobiography, namely that he worked as a portrait painter, glass painter, and land surveyor, we have little record of how he lived during the first years of his married life.

==Interest in ceramics==
In 1539 or 1540, Palissy was shown a white enamelled cup that astonished him, and he began a project to determine the nature of its production. The piece of fine white pottery may have derived from Faenza, Urbino, Saint-Porchaire or even China. In Palissy&#x27;s time pottery covered with beautiful white tin-glaze painted with enamels was manufactured throughout Italy, Spain, Germany and the South of France. A man as travelled and as acute as Palissy, however, would have been acquainted with its appearance and properties.

At the neighboring village of La Chapelle-des-Pots, Palissy mastered the rudiments of peasant pottery as it was practised in the 16th century. He may also have learned of manufacture of European tin-enamelled pottery. In his work Palissy produced ceramics using a great many ingredients including tin, lead, iron, steel, antimony, sapphire, copper, sand, saltwort, pearlash, and litharge.

==Rustic pottery==

For nearly sixteen years Palissy labored to recreate the pottery that he had seen, working with the utmost diligence but never succeeding. At times he and his family were reduced to poverty; he is said to have burned his furniture and the floor boards of his house to feed the fires of his furnaces. Meanwhile, he endured the reproaches of his wife, who, with their children clamouring for food, likely regarded her husband&#x27;s endeavors as little short of insanity. All these struggles and failures are faithfully recorded by Palissy in his autobiography.

Palissy failed to discover the secrets of Chinese porcelain or white tin-glaze maiolica, but he created a style of rustic pottery, called &quot;Palissy ware,&quot; for which he is now famous. Analysis confirms that Palissy used coloured lead glazes, lead silicates with added metal oxides of copper [for green], cobalt [for blue], manganese [for brown and black], or iron [for yellow ochre], with a small addition of tin [for opacity] to some of the glazes. The pottery is decorated with reliefs mimicking wildlife from Palissy&#x27;s native Saintonge marshes. These include fish, crustaceans, reptiles, ferns, and flowers.

In 1542, a peasant revolt against the &quot;gabelle&quot; salt tax in Saintonge resulted in royal forces, headed by the Duc de Montmorency, arriving near Palissy&#x27;s home. The duke was impressed by Palissy&#x27;s artistry and commissioned him to build retreats at the Château d&#x27;Écouen and Meudon. Palissy&#x27;s work there included the construction of wild gardens and ceramic creatures, following a romantic style similar to that of Italian artists Vasari, Cellini, and Michelangelo, and foreshadowing the baroque period.

==Work in Paris==

In 1548 Palissy was brought to Paris under the protection of Montmorency and Catherine des Medicis. Despite his conversion to Protestantism in 1546, in a departure from the established Catholic religion, Catherine asked Palissy to construct gardens for her in the Tuileries. In 1562, she gave him an official title in her court: &quot;the king&#x27;s inventor of rustic figurines.&quot;

Palissy was outspoken in his Protestant religious beliefs; he sometimes chastised influential officials by quoting from the prophetic books of the Old Testament. According to contemporaries, Palissy would criticize traders, judges, or Parliamentary counsellors, and benefices by citing the Book of Ezekiel: &quot;They are accursed, damned, and lost... Woe be to you, shepherds, who eat the fat and clothe you with the wool, and leave my flock scattered upon the mountains.&quot;

Although Palissy was Protestant, these nobles protected him from the ordinances of the parliament of Bordeaux. In 1562, it seized the property of all the Protestants in this district. Palissy&#x27;s workshops and kilns were destroyed, but he was saved. By the interposition of the all-powerful constable, he was appointed inventor of rustic pottery to the king and the queen-mother.

Around 1563, under royal protection, he was allowed to establish a fresh pottery works in Paris in the vicinity of the royal palace of the Louvre. The site of his kilns afterward became included within a portion of the Tuileries Garden. For about twenty-five years from this date, Palissy lived and worked in Paris. He appears to have remained a personal favorite of Catherine de&#x27; Medici and of her sons, in spite of his Protestantism. Catherine may have saved him from the bloodshed of Saint Bartholemew&#x27;s Day Massacre in 1572.

While he was working for the court, he produced numerous and varied works. In addition to continuing rustic figurines, he made a large number of dishes and plaques ornamented with scriptural or mythological subjects in relief. He seems to have made reproductions of pewter dishes of Francois Briot and other metal workers of the period.

==Lectures on natural science==

During this period Palissy gave several series of public lectures on natural history, the entrance fee being one crown, a large fee for those days. His ideas of springs and underground waters were published in his &quot;Discours admirables, de la nature des eaux et fontaines, tant naturelles qu&#x27;artificielles, des metaux, des sels et salines, des pierres, des terres, du feu et des maux&quot; (Paris, 1580). While Aristotle and Wang Chong correctly hypothesized about the role of precipitation in the water cycle, Palissy was the first to accurately surmise that rainfall alone was sufficient for the process and that rising underground water played no vital part. He was one of the first Europeans to enunciate theory consistent with today&#x27;s understandings of the origin of fossils. That and his practical application of Alexandrian theoretical works on hydraulics to the social issue of delivering public water to cities, were far in advance of the general knowledge of his time.

Palissy maintained that experience or practice should inform theory, which was useless without empirical foundations. He furthermore argued that scientific knowledge should be derived from observation and practice before classical philosophy:

Palissy described systems for acquiring or transporting water, and for insuring its quality, adding that any unable to reproduce his instructions were free to contact him through his publisher. He elaborated upon a theory of hydrothermal vents, volcanoes and earthquakes, which he attributed to a mixture of volatile substances and combustion beneath the earth surface. Palissy furthermore correctly surmised the origin of springs in his study of hydrology and geology.

Palissy correctly maintained that fossils were the remains of once living organisms, and contested the prevailing view that they had been produced by the biblical flood, or by astrological influence. He argued that minerals, dissolving into water to form &quot;congelative water,&quot; would precipitate and thereby petrify once living organisms in order to create fossils.

==Imprisonment and death==

The close of Palissy&#x27;s life was quite in keeping with his active and stormy youth. Despite the protection of the nobles and the court, the fanatical outburst of 1588 associated with the War of the Three Henrys led to his being thrown into the Bastille. According to D&#x27;Aubigné and fellow Protestants, Henry III offered Palissy his freedom if he would recant, though Palissy refused. Condemned to death when nearly eighty years of age, he died in a Bastille dungeon in 1590. Friend, chronicler and fellow prisoner Pierre de L&#x27;Estoile later recounted Palissy&#x27;s fate:

==In fiction==

In Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, Palissy is mentioned when the author describes the opulence of a character&#x27;s apartment: &quot;The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases, Lucca della Robbia faience, and Palissy platters; of old arm-chairs, in which perhaps had sat Henry IV.&quot;

Marcel Proust mentions Palissy in the third volume of &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;: &quot;...and a fish cooked in a court-bouillon was brought in on a long earthenware platter, on which, standing out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, intact but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water, surrounded by a ring of satellite shell-fish, of animalcules, crabs, shrimps, and mussels, it had the appearance of a ceramic dish by Bernard Palissy.&quot;

In Michel Zévaco&#x27;s Les Pardaillan, Jean de Pardaillan helps Pallissy in Bastille, and leaves him free. His guilt is described as &quot;make angry the fictional Catherine de&#x27; Medici&quot;

Palissy&#x27;s life and work are described in A.S. Byatt&#x27;s &quot;The Children&#x27;s Book&quot;. Palissy serves as an inspiration to the potter Benedict Fludd and his apprentice, Philip Warren.

Palissy figures as one of nineteen exemplary heroes in a series written by Uruguayan author Horacio Quiroga that was first published in 1927 in the popular Argentine weekly &quot;Caras y Caretas&quot;. Author Léonard N. Amico has produced a recent English language biography.

In the chapter on &#x27;Shells&#x27;, Gaston Bachelard, in his poetics of space, describes in some detail Palissy&#x27;s description of a natural fortress. It is constructed on the principle of a shell, with rough exterior and smooth interior in the form of a citadel. (&quot;Poetics of Space&quot;: Beacon Press. Ed 1994. XI. pp 127–132)

<text>David Andrew Patterson (born November 16, 1947) is an American computer scientist and academic who has held the position of professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley since 1976. He is a computer pioneer. He announced retirement in 2016 after serving nearly forty years, becoming a distinguished software engineer at Google. He currently is vice chair of the board of directors of the RISC-V Foundation, and the Pardee Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus at UC Berkeley.

Patterson is noted for his pioneering contributions to reduced instruction set computer (RISC) design, having coined the term RISC, and by leading the Berkeley RISC project. As of 2018, 99% of all new chips use a RISC architecture. He is also noted for leading the research on redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) storage, with Randy Katz.

His books on computer architecture, co-authored with John L. Hennessy, are widely used in computer science education. Hennessy and Patterson won the 2017 Turing Award for their work in developing RISC.

==Early life and education==
David Patterson grew up in Evergreen Park, Illinois. He graduated from South High School in Torrance, California. He then attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics in 1969. He continued on to obtain his Master of Science degree in 1970 and PhD in 1976, both in Computer Science at UCLA. Patterson&#x27;s PhD was advised by David F. Martin and Gerald Estrin.

==Research and career ==
Patterson is an important advocate and developer of the concept of reduced instruction set computing and coined the term &quot;RISC&quot;. He led the Berkeley RISC project from 1980, with Carlo H. Sequin, where the technique of register windows was introduced. He is also one of the innovators of the redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) together with Randy Katz and Garth Gibson. Patterson also led the Network of Workstations (NOW) project at Berkeley, an early effort in the area of computer clustering.

===Past positions===
Past chair of the Computer Science Division at U.C. Berkeley and the Computing Research Association, he served on the Information Technology Advisory Committee for the U.S. President (PITAC) during 2003–05 and was elected president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for 2004–06.

===Notable PhD students===
He has advised several notable Ph.D. students, including:
* David Ditzel, founder and former president of Transmeta
* Garth A. Gibson, co-inventor of redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID), founder and CTO of Panasas, professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and first president and chief executive officer of the Vector Institute
* Christos Kozyrakis, professor at Stanford University
* David Ungar, designer of the Self programming language, and currently researcher at IBM Research
* Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau, Grace Wahba professor and Chair of Computer Sciences at UW-Madison.

===Selected publications===
Patterson co-authored seven books, including two with John L. Hennessy on computer architecture: &quot;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach&quot; (6 editions—latest is ) and &quot;Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: the Hardware/Software Interface&quot; (5 editions—latest is ). They have been widely used as textbooks for graduate and undergraduate courses since 1990. His most recent book is with Andrew Waterman on the open architecture RISC-V: &quot;The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas (1st Edition)&quot; ().

For 2020 he was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Information and Communication Technologies.

At the 2013 California Raw Championships, he set the American Powerlifting Record for the state of California for his weight class and age group in bench press, dead lift, squat, and all three combined lifts.

On February 12, 2015, IEEE installed a plaque at UC Berkeley to commemorate the contribution of RISC-I in Soda Hall at UC Berkeley. The plaque reads:
* &quot;IEEE Milestone in Electrical and Computer Engineering&quot;
* First RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) Microprocessor
*&quot;UC Berkeley students designed and built the first VLSI reduced instruction-set computer in 1981. The simplified instructions of RISC-I reduced the hardware for instruction decode and control, which enabled a flat 32-bit address space, a large set of registers, and pipelined execution. A good match to C programs and the Unix operating system, RISC-I influenced instruction sets widely used today, including those for game consoles, smartphones and tablets.

On March 21, 2018, he was awarded the 2017 ACM A.M. Turing Award together with John L. Hennessy for developing RISC. The award attributed them for pioneering &quot;a systematic, quantitative approach to the design and evaluation of computer architectures with enduring impact on the microprocessor industry&quot;.

In 2022 he was awarded the Charles Stark Draper Prize by the National Academy of Engineering alongside John L. Hennessy, Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson for contributions to the invention, development, and implementation of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) chips.

===Charitable work===
From 2003 to 2012 he rode in the annual Waves to Wine MS charity event as part of Bike MS; a 2-day cycling adventure. He was the top fundraiser in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.

<doc id="816255" wikidata="Q3046435" url="?curid=816255" title="Earlsfield">
<text>Earlsfield is an area within the London Borough of Wandsworth, London, England. It is a typical south London suburb and comprises mostly residential Victorian terraced houses with a high street of shops, bars, and restaurants between Garratt Lane, Allfarthing Lane, and Burntwood Lane. The population of Earlsfield at the 2001 Census was 12,903, increasing to 15,448 at the 2011 Census.

Earlsfield railway station provides access to central London (three stops to London Waterloo (Clapham Junction, Vauxhall, Waterloo) in 12 minutes) and other areas in South London (Victoria - changing at Clapham Junction, Wimbledon one stop). The station&#x27;s redevelopment was completed in April 2013.

== History ==
In medieval times, the area now known as Earlsfield was the northern part of the manor and hamlet of Garrat (also spelt Garratt, Garrett or Garret) in the parish of Wandsworth and notorious in the 18th century for the Garrat mock elections. By then the area was already industrialised with numerous mills along the River Wandle and in the early 19th century London&#x27;s first railway, the horse-drawn Surrey Iron Railway, ran along Garratt Lane. This was followed in 1838 by the opening of the London and South Western Railway which originally passed through without stopping. Later in the century, suburban development began to creep across from Wandsworth Common.

In April 1884, the L&amp;SWR opened Earlsfield station on Garratt Lane, prompting further development. The station was named after a nearby residence, Earlsfield, now demolished. This was owned by the Davis family, who also owned the land required for the station, and one of the conditions of sale was that the station would be named after their house.

The area was once a working-class suburb of Wandsworth and as such much of the property is medium-sized terraced housing, though several new developments have been or are being developed, notably the Olympian Homes development between the station and library. The area now houses young families attracted by the affordability of the area in comparison to its northern, western and eastern neighbours, Clapham, Wandsworth, Battersea and Putney, contributing to the wider area&#x27;s nickname of Nappy Valley.

Earlsfield Library has on display a range of historic photographs of the area.

Between 1853 and 1864, the area in the south of Earlsfield, Summerstown, was the site of the Copenhagen Running Grounds, a major venue for pedestrianism.

Haldane Place, near the Wandle, was the site of the main manufacturing base for Airfix between 1939 and 1981.

== Geography ==

The River Wandle flows roughly parallel to Garratt Lane through the area, and has been the subject of a major, council-funded clean-up operation, though it has been subjected to several pollution incidents in the past few years. There is some light industry located between the high street and the river.

== High Street ==

The main shopping street – Garratt Lane – includes estate agents, cafes and restaurants, pubs, bars and hairdressers. The stretch of Earlsfield just to the south of the station includes chains and an increasing number of independent cafes, delicatessen, butchers and public houses including The Earlsfield situated in the old railway station house have opened in recent years.

Garratt Lane is home to cross-cultural theatre company Tara Arts and its venue Tara Theatre. Opened in 2007 (and refurbished in 2016), the space hosts local and national companies as well as staging its own productions.

There are two churches in the centre - Earlsfield Baptist church (opened in 1900) on Magdalen Road and St Andrew&#x27;s, Earlsfield (Church of England, built in two stages between 1888 and 1902 ) on the corner of Garratt Lane and Waynflete Street, with St Gregory&#x27;s (Catholic) and St John the Divine (CoE) further down Garratt Lane towards Wandsworth.

== Notable residents ==
*Louis de Bernières – He lived in Earlsfield while writing &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;. His book and play &quot;Sunday Morning At the Centre of the World&quot; &quot;is a homage to the diverse community of Earlsfield.&quot;
*Sadiq Khan – Former MP for Tooting (which includes Earlsfield within its constituency boundaries) and Mayor of London since May 2016. He lived as a child in the Henry Prince Estate on Garratt Lane.

<doc id="816266" wikidata="Q473472" url="?curid=816266" title="Hahajima">
<text>Hahajima, Haha Jima, or is the second-largest island within the Bonin or Ogasawara Islands SSE of the Japanese Home Islands. The steeply-sloped island, which is about in area, has a population of 440. It is part of Ogasawara Village in Ogasawara Subprefecture, which is approximately south of Tokyo, Japan. 

The highest peaks Hahajima are &quot;Chibusayama&quot; (lit. &quot;Breast Mountain&quot;), approximately , and Sakaigatake, . It is part of an archipelago that includes Chichijima approximately to the north and the nearby smaller islands such as Anejima and Imōtojima and Mukōjima. The group forms the Hahajima Rettō (母島列島; formerly the &quot;Baily Group&quot;).

==History==
Micronesian tools and carvings suggest prehistoric visits or settlement but the island was long uninhabited before its rediscovery, sometimesbut probably mistakenlycredited to Bernardo de la Torre during his failed 1543 attempt to find a northern route back to Mexico from the Philippines. Captain James Coffin, of the whaler originally named the largest island in the group &quot;Fisher Island&quot;, which became Hahajima, and the second largest &quot;Kidd Island&quot;, after the owners of his vessel. The islands came to be known as the &quot;Coffin Islands&quot;. (Hahajima was also called &quot;Hillsborough Island&quot;.) Hahajima was settled by Europeans before becoming part of Japan. 

During the Pacific War, the Japanese government removed the local civilian population and fortified the island. It was attacked several times by the US bombers. First on December 4, 1944 when Navy search planes of Fleet Air Wing One joined with Seventh Air Force bombers to attack installations on the island as well as Iwo Jima. Four days later there was another attack by Fleet Air Wing One. Then on December 10, B-25 Mitchells from the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing struck at shipping moored at Hahajima. The remains of defensive fortifications are now one of the island&#x27;s tourist attractions. 

The population, which was 1,546 in 1904 and 1,905 in 1940, is now only 450. A single road connects the abandoned village of Kitamura (北村) at the north end of the island to the village of Okimura (沖村) – formerly &quot;Newport&quot;, at the southern end of the island, where the harbor is located. The island can be reached by ferry in about two hours from Chichijima. The economy of Hahajima is based on commercial fishing, tourism as well as a state-run rum distillery.

==Education==

Ogasawara Village operates the island&#x27;s public elementary and junior high school, Ogasawara Village Municipal Haha-jima Elementary School and Junior High School (小笠原村立母島小中学校). Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education operates Ogasawara High School on nearby Chichijima.

==Ecology==
Hahajima is of considerable interest to malacologists because of its endemic land snail fauna, including the eponymous &quot;Lamprocystis hahajimana&quot;. Due to the widespread presence of invasive species including goats (which destroy habitat) and rodents, flatworms and the rosy wolfsnail (which eat the native snails), it was feared that many of the endemics had become extinct.

But most if not all of the endemic land snail species seem to persist on the remote Higashizaki peninsula on the eastern coast. This is a quite pristine expanse of ground, scenic but very hard to reach (one has to climb Mt. Chibusa before descending to the peninsula). It consists of sheer seacliffs surrounding a plateau with Chinese fan palm (&quot;Livistona chinensis&quot;), pandanus and broadleaf (e.g. &quot;Persea kobu&quot;, a wild avocado) forest, and appears to be untouched by invasive species at present. It has been proposed that access to the area should be monitored, so that visitors will not inadvertently contribute to destroying this unique area.

===Snails===
All of these snails are endemic at least to the Bonin Islands.
* &quot;Boninena callistoderma&quot; – Endangered, now restricted to Hahajima and nearby Anejima
* &quot;Gastrocopta boninensis&quot; – Vulnerable
* &quot;Hirasea acutissima&quot; – Endangered (believed extinct, rediscovered 2003), endemic to Hahajima
* &quot;Lamellidea biplicata&quot; – Vulnerable
* &quot;Lamprocystis hahajimana&quot; – Endangered
* &quot;Mandarina hahajimana&quot; – Data deficient, possibly a new taxon
* &quot;Mandarina polita&quot; – Data deficient
* &quot;Ogasawarana yoshiwarana&quot; – Critically endangered (believed extinct, rediscovered 2003), endemic to Hahajima
* &quot;Ogasawarana arata&quot; – Data deficient
* &quot;Paludinella minima&quot; – Data deficient
* &quot;Vertigo dedecora&quot; – Vulnerable

Among birds, the Bonin white-eye (&quot;Apalopteron familiare&quot;), a gaudy-colored passerine, seems to occur nowhere else anymore than on Hahajima. The extinct Bonin grosbeak (&quot;Chaunoproctus ferreorostris&quot;) is sometimes said to have occurred in the Hahajima Group (though not on Haha-jima itself), but this seems not to be true. &quot;Columba janthina nitens&quot;, the Bonin subspecies of the Japanese wood-pigeon, used to occur on Haha-jima. While it is not precisely known when it vanished from this island, the taxon apparently became completely extinct during the 1980s, but was rediscovered in 1998. The island has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

<text>Åke Green (; born 3 June 1941) is a Swedish Pentecostal Christian pastor who was prosecuted, but acquitted, under Sweden&#x27;s law against hate speech because of critical opinions on homosexuality in his sermons. The district court found him guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals (hovrätt). On 11 February 2005, the Göta Court of Appeal overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the Prosecutor-General (&quot;Riksåklagaren&quot;) appealed this decision to the Supreme Court, which on 29 November also acquitted.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish law as it currently stands regarding agitation against groups, and that the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression as well as freedom of religion does not protect him. However, the Supreme Court also stated that the freedom of expression as well as freedom of religion provided by the European Convention on Human Rights, which is superior to normal Swedish law according to the &quot;lex superior&quot; principle regarding the ECHR found in the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) 2:19, gives him protection, since jurisprudence shows that a conviction would probably not be upheld by the European Court.

== Background ==
In 2002, the Riksdag included references to sexual orientation in a list of groups protected against persecution in the form of threats and expressions of disdain. The list appears in a section of Swedish Criminal Code (&quot;Brottsbalken&quot;) known as &quot;agitation against a population group&quot; (&quot;hets mot folkgrupp&quot;).

== The sermon ==
At his church in Borgholm, Green delivered a sermon in which he described &quot;sexual perversions&quot; (referencing homosexuality) as &quot;abnormal, a horrible cancerous tumor in the body of society.&quot; He also said that a person cannot be a Christian and a homosexual at the same time.

Green had invited members of the media to attend the sermon, but none were present when he preached it in the presence of about fifty listeners. He wrote a summary of the sermon, including the above-mentioned quotes, which was printed in the local newspaper &quot;Ölandsbladet&quot;. A representative of nearby Kalmar&#x27;s RFSL, an LGBT equal rights organization, reported the sermon to the police and the controversy began.

==Controversy==
The district court found Åke Green guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals (hovrätt) and Green&#x27;s lawyer maintained his client&#x27;s religious freedom had been violated. On 11 February 2005 Göta hovrätt overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the Prosecutor-General (&quot;Riksåklagaren&quot;) appealed this decision to the Supreme Court, which on 29 November also acquitted him.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish hate speech law (&quot;Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp&quot;). A conviction would probably not be upheld by the European Court considering Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which covers freedom of religion. After a discussion of the case law regarding Article 9 and 10 the court stated: &quot;Under these circumstances, it is likely that the European Court, in a determination of the restriction of Åke Green’s right to preach his Biblically based opinion that a judgment of conviction would constitute, would find that this restriction is not proportionate, and would therefore be a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.&quot;

The sentence has raised a controversy all around the world, with disputes between those who see it as a victory for human rights and freedom from intolerance, and those who see it as an attack on religious freedom and the right to free speech, which in themselves are both regarded as human rights.

Green became a cause celebre for anti-gay preacher Fred Phelps, who has labelled anyone who held the belief that God could love non-elect sinners as being eternally damned. Nonetheless, Phelps installed a monument praising Green on his website. Green subsequently denounced Phelps. &quot;I think it is appalling that people say things like that,&quot; Green said, &quot;it is extremely unpleasant.&quot; In response, Phelps and his organization, the Westboro Baptist Church, denounced Green as a traitor and an ingrate, and he later removed the Green tribute from his website.

Åke Green was also supported by Ulf Ekman of Livets Ord and Robert Vesterlund&#x27;s &quot;Info-14&quot;.

Responding to the sentence, Sören Andersson, the president of Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights (RFSL), said that religious freedom could never be used as a reason to persecute people.

== Temperance organisations ==
In the beginning of 2008 the organisation IOGT-NTO, a Swedish temperance movement, decided to withdraw Åke Green&#x27;s membership, stating that his statements about homosexuality conflict with IOGT-NTO&#x27;s bylaws.

Instead, Green became an adherent of the Christian temperance movement, the &quot;Blue ribbon&quot; Blå bandet aligned with the International Blue Cross. He was involved in another controversy following the announcement that he was to hold a speech at a common manifestation together with the Social Democrats on 1 May 2008, in Vänersborg. The Social Democrats excluded members of the Blue Ribbon, including Green, after several protests, some of which were published in Vänersborgs local newspaper, &quot;TTELA&quot;.

<doc id="816274" wikidata="Q1351854" url="?curid=816274" title="McLaren Automotive">
<text>McLaren Automotive ( ; formerly known as McLaren Cars) is a British luxury automotive manufacturer based at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, England. The main products of the company are sports cars, which are produced in-house in designated production facilities. In July 2017, McLaren Automotive became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the wider McLaren Group, which is wholly owned by Mumtalakat Holding Company, the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom of Bahrain.

==History==
===Origin and founder===
McLaren Automotive replaced McLaren Cars in 2010. McLaren Cars had been founded in 1985 and released the McLaren F1 in 1992. Between 1994 and 2010, McLaren Cars was registered as a &#x27;dormant company&#x27;, before the founding of McLaren Automotive in 2010. The new company was originally separate from the existing McLaren companies to enable investment in the new venture, but was brought together in July 2017 after Ron Dennis sold his shares in McLaren Automotive and McLaren Group.

McLaren&#x27;s Formula One founder Bruce McLaren was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1937, and learned about cars and engineering at his parents&#x27; service station and workshop there. By 15, he had entered a local hillclimb in an Austin 7 Ulster, winning his first race in the car. In 1958, McLaren arrived in the United Kingdom with the &#x27;Driver to Europe&#x27; scheme, intended to help Australian and New Zealand racers to compete in Europe. His mentor, Jack Brabham, introduced him to Cooper Car Company, a small team based in Surbiton, Surrey. Auspiciously starting his Formula One career in 1958, McLaren joined the Formula One team a year later. That same year, he won the US Grand Prix at age 22, making him the youngest Grand Prix winner to that date. He stayed with Cooper for a further seven years, winning three more Grands Prix and other races, driving for Jaguar and Aston Martin, and winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966 with Ford.

McLaren founded Bruce McLaren Motor Racing in 1963. A year later, the company built the first true McLaren race car, the M1 (24 customer cars were produced by Elva). Its successor, the M1B, allowed McLaren into the Can-Am championship, where it dominated with 43 victories, almost three times more than rival Porsche. In 1965, the first McLaren Formula One car, the M2B, debuted at the Monaco Grand Prix.

After his victories and time in the F3, McLaren was designing and testing a prototype M6GT-registered OBH 500H, a lightweight sports car with an estimated top speed of 165 mph and zero to 100 mph time of eight seconds. McLaren died while testing a race car at Goodwood in 1970 before the prototype could be completed.

=== Merging, spinoff and growth ===
In 1980, the company merged with Ron Dennis’ Project 4 Racing team. The merger brought back designer John Barnard, who was interested in using carbon fibre composite. Carbon fibre was already used in aerospace applications but had never been applied to a complete racing car monocoque. McLaren pioneered the use of carbon fibre in motor racing with its new car, the MP4/1, bringing new levels of rigidity and driver safety to Formula 1. In August 1988, Dennis, Team Principal and Gordon Murray started to develop a new car and in 1992, the F1 was launched with a total production run of just 106 units.

Following a brief collaboration with Mercedes-Benz for the SLR McLaren, McLaren Automotive was re-launched as a standalone manufacturer in 2010, spinning off McLaren Racing. The company launched the 12C in 2011 and its Spider variant in 2012. The limited-run P1 went into production in 2013 and ended in 2015. After introducing a business plan to release a car or model every year, the company unveiled the 650S in Coupé and Spider models in 2014, and unveiled the new Sports Series range comprising the McLaren 570S and 540C in 2015. The company debuted a car for children, the P1TM, after the P1, in September 2016 and announced the same month that they are developing a powerful battery for Formula E. In October 2016, councillors were reported to be looking at a proposition for land opposite the McLaren Technology Centre for construction and announced the &quot;Pure McLaren Arctic Experience&quot; the same month, an event where a participant was trained to drive a 570S in the Arctic Circle.

On 10 December 2024, it was reported that CYVN Holdings have acquired the automotive business of McLaren from Mumtalakat, a deal which will see the high-performance automobile company weathers through the financial woes and builds its first electric supercar. The deal will also see CYVN hold a non-controlling stake in McLaren&#x27;s racing business.

== Headquarters and facilities ==
McLaren Automotive is based at the McLaren Technology Centre, alongside the rest of the McLaren Group, and at the adjacent McLaren Production Centre. The two facilities are connected by a subterranean walkway, with the MPC built partially underground to minimise its presence.

In 2017 McLaren announced the construction of the £50m McLaren Composites Technology Centre (MCTC) at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Rotherham. The facility will build carbon fibre chassis for future McLaren road cars. The facility aims to give McLaren greater control over the manufacture of composite tubs, providing an opportunity to increase the pace of the design and development of the tubs. Full production will begin at the MCTC by 2020. The MCTC was officially opened by The Duke of Cambridge, Duchess of Cambridge, and the Crown Prince of Bahrain in November 2018.

== Products and strategy ==
McLaren&#x27;s first purpose-built road car was the F1, based on a concept developed by Gordon Murray that he convinced Ron Dennis to back. McLaren Cars went into hibernation following the completion of the F1&#x27;s production run, and McLaren didn&#x27;t return to the production car market until launching McLaren Automotive in 2010, just prior to the release of the MP4-12C (eventually simplified to just 12C) in 2011.

McLaren launched its current three-tier product structure in 2015, dividing their range of cars into the Sports, Super, and Ultimate Series. Cars in the Sports and Super Series are given names based on the car&#x27;s power output in PS, followed by a model designation (C for club, S for sport, GT for grand tourer and LT for longtail). The entry-level Sports Series consists of the 570S, 570S Spider, 570GT, 540C, 600LT and 600LT Spider. The Super Series, considered to be McLaren&#x27;s core model range, originally included the 650S, 625C, and 675LT. These were replaced with the 720S in 2017 (and 720S Spider in 2018). The high-end Ultimate Series was led by the P1 and P1 GTR, now it includes the Senna, Senna GTR and the upcoming Speedtail, intended to be the successor to the original F1. The F1 and 12C were retroactively included in the Ultimate and Super Series, respectively. The structure was expanded to include the GT Series with the release of the McLaren GT in 2019.

=== Collaborations ===
==== Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren ====

In 1999, McLaren agreed to design and manufacture the SLR (also known as P7) in conjunction with Mercedes-Benz. DaimlerChrysler was the engine supplier to McLaren Racing through its Formula One partner Mercedes-Benz division. The final stages of production of the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren took place at a designated assembly facility at the McLaren Technology Centre.

The SLR featured a 5.5 litre supercharged V8 engine that produced at 6500 rpm and of torque at 3250–5000 rpm. It can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 3.8 seconds and 0 to 100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 6.3 seconds.

In 2006, the Mercedes-Benz McLaren SLR 722 Edition was announced. The &quot;722 Edition&quot; produced at 6500 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm, with a top speed of (3 km/h more than the standard SLR). A new suspension is used with 19-inch (480 mm) light-alloy wheels, a stiffer damper configuration and 0.4 inches (10 mm) lower body.

In 2007, the Mercedes-Benz McLaren SLR Convertible was announced, which has been available from late 2007. The car uses the same supercharged 5.5 litre V8 that is in the coupé.

A limited edition called the SLR Stirling Moss was introduced. The car was the final SLR produced and a tribute to Stirling Moss. Beneath the scissor-doors is a plaque with Moss&#x27; signature on it.

==== Unreleased vehicles ====
The partnership between Mercedes-Benz and McLaren resulted in three further cars being proposed. The P9 was to be a mid-engined baby supercar with a less expensive model, with the P8 (or &quot;SLS&quot;) competing with cars such as the Ferrari F430, Bentley Continental GT, and Aston Martin DB9. Both cars were to be powered by naturally aspirated V8 engines. The P10 would have been an SLR replacement.

All three cars were aborted in 2005, with Mercedes rumoured to have considered the projects simply too costly to turn into a solid business case, although Mercedes&#x27; AMG subsidiary produced a flagship sports car called the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG. The car had a naturally aspirated V8 with over 570 bhp (430 kW; 580 PS); however, it is not thought to be related to the P8 project.

== Division==
=== McLaren Customer Racing ===
McLaren Customer Racing is the sports car racing arm of McLaren Automotive, established in 2011 as McLaren GT to develop, build and support all McLaren track and GT race activities. The division is currently responsible for the design, development and production of the 720S GT3 and 570S GT4, along with the new Artura GT4 and Artura Trophy.

The first car developed by McLaren GT was the 12C GT3, which was launched in 2011, and following a development year, 25 examples were delivered to customers for racing throughout Europe in 2012. The debut season saw 13 McLaren GT customer teams visit 14 countries and between them, the teams claimed a total of 19 race victories in the FIA GT1 World Championship, Blancpain Endurance Series, Barcelona 24hours, British GT, City Challenge Baku, FFSA French GT and GT Cup.

A total of 19 McLaren GT customer teams contested the 2013 season, entering 108 races across 15 championships globally. In total, the teams claimed 27 pole positions, 23 victories, a further 39 podium finishes and three championship titles.

Following the successful 2013 season, McLaren GT expanded its customer support with the competitive debut for the 12C GT3 car in the Pirelli World Challenge championship in North America.

Around 15 examples of the 650S GT3 made race debuts during the 2015 race season, claiming a number of victories. Most notably the McLaren GT customer racing team Von Ryan Racing took victory at the Blancpain Endurance Series at Silverstone, marking the first win in the Blancpain Endurance Series for the 650S GT3 in its debut competitive season.

The 650S GT3 was the dominant GT car in 2016. In February, Australian team Tekno Autosports won the 2016 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour at the Mount Panorama Circuit in Australia with drivers Álvaro Parente, Shane van Gisbergen and Jonathon Webb. In the 2016 Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup, British team Garage 59 won the 3 Hours of Monza and the 1000 km on their way to the title with their team of van Gisbergen, Rob Bell and Côme Ledogar.

=== McLaren Special Operations ===
McLaren Special Operations (MSO) is McLaren&#x27;s bespoke division. Officially launched in 2011, MSO&#x27;s origins date back over 20 years, as the division grew out of the McLaren Customer Care Programme that was set up in the early 1990s to service, maintain and personalise the McLaren F1 for owners.

<doc id="816276" wikidata="Q3202921" url="?curid=816276" title="The Wishsong of Shannara">
<text>The Wishsong of Shannara is an epic fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks. It is the final novel in the Original Shannara Trilogy, with the other two being &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; and &quot;The Elfstones of Shannara&quot;. The story revolves around Jair and Brin Ohmsford, the children of the main characters from &quot;The Elfstones of Shannara&quot;: Wil Ohmsford and Eretria. The siblings, each possessing an inherited magic, must save the Four Lands from the evil magic within a tome called the Ildatch. 

== Plot summary ==

=== Prelude ===
Before the dawn of mankind, Demons created a book of dark magic, called the Ildatch. This book was so full of their dark essence that it became a living thing, with a will of its own. When the Druids gathered all knowledge and lore of the Old World to themselves in the aftermath of the Great Wars, the book of Ildatch was uncovered after countless millennia. It remained harmless until the Druid Brona found it in the halls of Paranor and began to read and unlock its terrible secrets. Brona was eventually subverted by the very power he sought to control and thus the Warlock Lord was born. Allanon thought that the dark book had been buried in the destruction of the Skull Kingdom after Shea triumphed over the Warlock Lord in &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;, but it soon became apparent that the survivors of the calamity recovered the book, and delved into its arcane knowledge.

=== The Beginning ===
Allanon returned to the world due to the presence of a new evil, and once more he needed the aid of another generation of Ohmsfords. It is revealed that the Ildatch possessed a new generation of mortals, the Mord Wraiths, to pick up where the Warlock Lord left off. From their stronghold in the Eastland, the Mord Wraiths enslaved many Gnomes and sent them against the Dwarves. Allanon needed Brin&#x27;s magic, the Wishsong, to enable him to enter the Maelmord, which is a living jungle that kills anyone who sets foot in it, and destroy the Ildatch. Helping her is Rone Leah, who is the great-grandson of Menion Leah. He wields the Sword of Leah, which is an &quot;ordinary&quot; sword until Allanon dips it into the waters of the Hadeshorn to help him to protect Brin. Jair was left at home, despite his pleas to go with his older sister, but he ran north when Gnomes begin searching Shady Vale itself. Allanon explains that Jair&#x27;s command of the Wishsong only lies in illusion, where Brin&#x27;s command of the Wishsong lies in reality.

=== Jair&#x27;s Odyssey ===
Jair was left at home to watch over the Ohmsford house and to inform his parents of what had transpired during Allanon&#x27;s visit. Not long after, however, he found himself in some trouble of his own when he stumbled across the gnome, Slanter, who was tracking the druid for the Mord Wraiths. After leaving Slanter unconscious and sneaking back into his house to retrieve the elfstones, hoping to defeat the Wraiths, he headed north to the Highlands. Slanter soon caught up with him, though. He was captured and was given over to the gnome patrol for whom Slanter was tracking. Later on when it seemed like there was no hope of escape and he was to be delivered to one of the Black Walkers, the gnome patrol stumbled on Garet Jax, a dark and mysterious warrior people knew as the Weapons Master. He freed Jair along with a little assistance from Slanter. The small company decided to head east to Culhaven, home of the dwarves, hoping to find word of Allanon and Brin&#x27;s passing. Jair met the King of the Silver River here; the ancient faerie creature informed him that unless he went to the Eastland, Brin would die. He offered Jair his help. He gave Jair 3 magics (A one time real use of the Wishsong, a bag of Silver Dust to purify the Silver River, and a mirror that allowed Jair to view Brin through use of the Wishsong) for Jair&#x27;s three Elfstones and then said to him that Garet Jax would protect him on his way to Brin. In exchange, he asked Jair to purify the Silver River at its source, as the Silver River was being poisoned by the Mord Wraiths. Jair went on his quest, joined by the Gnome Slanter and a group from Culhaven, including the &quot;Weapons Master&quot; Garet Jax.

=== The End of Ildatch ===
Meanwhile, Brin and Rone watched helplessly as Allanon was killed by an ancient Demon, a Jachyra, that had been summoned by the Mord Wraiths. The creature was destroyed, but Allanon, the last of the Druids, was mortally wounded and Rone is wounded when he attempts to aid Allanon with the Sword of Leah. The Jachyra throws the sword from the battle scene into a river. Before he died, Allanon marked Brin&#x27;s line to succeed him. Rone and Brin pressed on, hopeless. They met Cogline, a partially insane old man who tamed a Moor Cat named Whisper, and his granddaughter, Kimber Boh, who was skilled in many techniques, and who helped them on their journey. First, Kimber Boh takes Rone and Brin to visit the Grimpond, an ancient being, much like the wraiths of Bremen and Allanon but much more maligned. The spirit informs Brin (who spoke to the being alone) that the quest will claim her life and those traveling with her. After the meeting with the Grimpond; Cogline, Kimber Boh, and Whisper aid Rone and Brin in retrieving the Sword of Leah from a tribe of Spider Gnomes. After another long trek, Brin left the others while they were in the sewers of the castle and finally reached the Ildatch. Brin found herself unable to destroy it because first, she became entranced, and then she was possessed by it. The tome coveted her power and wanted to use her body as a tool to wield its destruction. At the last moment, as he had just purified the Silver River, Jair uses the Wishsong (the given ability from the King of the Silver River) to appear in the chamber where Brin is being subverted by the Ildatch. He found Brin almost deformed by her power and was horrified by the skeletal appearance she had assumed. He tried to snap Brin out of her trance with his illusions but failed. Nevertheless, the love of her brother snapped Brin out of her trance. She finally destroyed the book, and the siblings returned home, but at a price: Allanon was dead, along with nearly all of Jair&#x27;s companions (all but Slanter). At the end, the shade of Allanon came to Brin and told her never to use the wishsong again then reminded her of her trust, and informed her that magic would soon fade from the world again.

== &quot;Indomitable&quot; ==

&quot;Indomitable&quot; is a short story published in Robert Silverberg&#x27;s &quot;Legends II&quot;, written by Brooks as an epilogue to &quot;The Wishsong of Shannara&quot; storyline.

After the end of &quot;The Wishsong of Shannara&quot;, Brin has now married Rone and Jair is still with his parents, working in their business when Kimber Boh found him. She told him that Cogline has asked that he travel to the Eastland to destroy the last page of the Ildatch. He does, and so he traveled to the ruins of the Maelmord where the last vestiges of the Mord Wraiths are using their power. Jair found out that his Wishsong became more powerful, allowing him not only to create illusions, but to actually change his physical form. Jair destroys the last page of the Ildatch, by assuming the form of Garet Jax and returns home.

== Dark Wraith of Shannara ==

==Reception==
Neil Gaiman reviewed &quot;The Wishsong of Shannara&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Terry Brooks rehashes the same &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; ripoff he inflicted on the public in the first two books. A must for those who like fantasy trilogies with silly names.&quot;

<doc id="816278" wikidata="Q9087729" url="?curid=816278" title="Tina Armstrong">
<text>is a character in the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; fighting game series by Koei Tecmo. Originally conceived as a tropical &quot;deadly dancer&quot; character by lead developer Tomonobu Itagaki, she was later changed to a professional wrestler due to the development team&#x27;s love for the sport. The daughter of fellow character Bass Armstrong, he wants her to follow in his footsteps as a wrestler, but she has ambitions to be a model, actress and rock star, much to his dismay. Through the course of the franchise, she has been voiced by Mami Koyama, Yūko Nagashima and Kate Higgins.

Since her debut Tina has been very popular, praised for her character&#x27;s physical beauty and her personality, most heavily by Asian media outlets. Additional praise has been given to her relationship with Bass, but also how well her character background such as being a model works with titles such as the &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme&quot; series. She has also been cited as a positive example of a female character in literary sources and seen as a partial response to a growing female gaming demographic. Other publications have derided the series&#x27; emphasis on sex appeal through her, seeing her as an example of the sexualization of women in video games.

==Conception and creation==

While working on Koei Tecmo&#x27;s first &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; game, Tina was originally envisioned by lead developer Tomonobu Itagaki to be a &quot;Deadly Dancer&quot;, a tropical girl character that fought hit-and-run tactics with &quot;light, dance-like steps&quot;. Meanwhile, the character Bass Armstrong, at this point in development called &quot;T-Bass&quot;, was planned to be the game&#x27;s professional wrestling practitioner, as they felt it was a staple of fighting games at that point. Itagaki stated however due to having a lack of interest regarding and ignorance of professional wrestling, Bass was shelved and he focused working on Tina instead. This caused an outcry from the development team, as many of them were professional wrestling fans themselves and did not want omit the fighting style from the game. As a result Itagaki revised his initial concept, with Tina being the debut wrestler for the game&#x27;s initial release, with motion capture used to create her animations. While Bass was later implemented in the PlayStation port of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, set up in the series&#x27; lore as Tina&#x27;s father, the original dancer idea would be revisited in the series through the character Lisa Hamilton.

To develop her attacks and animation they took inspiration from Japanese female wrestler Manami Toyota, such as her Japanese Ocean Cyclone suplex. Itagaki meanwhile began researching old wrestling footage. However, the development team had some difficulty as they felt heavy wrestling moves such as chops would not work as well coming from a female character. Bass&#x27;s introduction helped, as they were able to give him more refined powerful moves the developers wanted to include. Some techniques such as her Rodeo Hold meanwhile were removed between iterations of the game due to Itagaki feeling they did not translate well to the game&#x27;s visual presentation. Others were completely redone for &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;, due to Itagaki feeling they weren&#x27;t quite where he wanted them in terms of presentation, though he had to be careful with the workload given to the motion capture team as they had limited time.

Meanwhile the planning team was in charge of developing her personality, and Itagaki was glad they were able to present her as a cheerful American character. He specifically chose Texas as the origin for Tina and Bass to help solidify this image, and he was pleased when fans from the state told him they considered the characters very Texan. Itagaki further observed that of the cast Tina was the most popular with American audiences, which led him to develop other characters such as Lisa to help a wider cultural playerbase feel included.

===Design===
Standing 174 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall with measurements of 95-60-89 cm (37-24-35 in), Tina is a white American woman with blue eyes and blonde hair that extends down her neck and frames her face. According to Itagaki, Tina was intended as a blonde at her debut, but due to hardware issues with the Sega NAOMI arcade hardware they could not properly render her hair color, making it appear darker than intended in the first game. However, according to the development team it was originally brown as a remnant of her original tropical woman design. In the first game, several of her outfits alternate between giving her brown and blonde hair, where in the game&#x27;s sequel her setting was revised and her hair color was now strictly blonde.

For the original &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, the development team wanted to counter the then-perception that it was impossible to &quot;create beautiful girls in 3D&quot;, with Itagaki aiming to create &quot;Digital Venus&quot; designs that would be popular on media character rankings. To this end particular emphasis was placed on the size and movement of the cast&#x27;s breasts, in part due to the development team&#x27;s own preference and what they perceived as a &quot;breast boom&quot; in Japan at the time, an increase in average bust sizes across the nation. Tina&#x27;s breasts are the largest amongst the series&#x27; primary cast, an aspect along with her &quot;joyful&quot; personality they felt significantly contributed to her high popularity in location test surveys for the first game&#x27;s arcade release. With &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;, her model was significantly redesigned, part of an effort by the developers to reduce the game&#x27;s sexualization of the female cast in response to feedback from Koei Tecmo&#x27;s overseas branch. The changes in the game led to some backlash from fans however, and some aspects were reverted.

When developing her initial outfit, several Japanese female wrestling outfits were considered. In the first game, her primary outfit consisted of a sleeveless red shirt tie up to expose her midriff, black leggings, and red gloves with circular weights around each wrist. In the game&#x27;s sequel her outfit changed to incorporate a black bustier bra with matching laced high-cut spats, a sleeveless white high cut jacket, white cowboy boots, and white frills that dangle off her lower arms. This remained her primary outfit in several titles such as &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, or was included as an alternative. Meanwhile throughout the series she has multiple other outfit options, some of which designed with fanservice in mind such as a catsuit with a tail. Others incorporated either cowgirl or American flag aesthetics as the development team felt both suited her.

==Appearances==
Tina Armstrong was introduced in the 1996 fighting video game &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; by Koei Tecmo, and is the daughter of professional wrestler Bass. Tina&#x27;s mother died when she was young, with Bass raising her as a single father and wanting her to follow in his footsteps as a professional wrestler. Tina however wished to be a model, and the two routinely bicker and fight over her future. After Bass entered the Dead or Alive fighting tournament, she took part herself hoping the exposure would help launch that career. Despite Bass&#x27; interference, she successfully garners such attention at the end of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;″s tournament, and later also becomes a rock star. She enters the subsequent tournaments hoping to propel her career further and become a Hollywood actress, with Bass still wanting her to instead follow in his footsteps. By &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot;, Tina has formed a wrestling group with her father and MMA fighter Mila, hoping to use the exposure to run as a state governor.

In terms of gameplay, Tina is designed to be a &quot;brute&quot; style character that does heavy hitting attacks, however lacks the strength of some of the game&#x27;s cast. To balance this, she has higher agility than those other characters, able to perform short combos or strong singular attacks, such as launching herself butt first with her hips to collide with the opponent. Much of Tina&#x27;s gameplay revolves around countering an opponent&#x27;s attacks selectively, and being careful to not be countered herself. Additionally she has a wide variety of grab type moves, and a special attack that can be performed when her back is against a wall, leaping off it and grabbing the opponent in a bodyslam.

Outside of the main series titles, she also appears in the first two &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme&quot; spinoff games. While she was originally excluded from &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme 3&quot; she later appeared in &quot;Venus Vacation&quot; to celebrate &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;″s 25th anniversary. Producer Yasunori Sakuda noted it was done with some difficulty, as he felt the fanbase would have reacted badly to a &quot;half-hearted effort&quot;. In other media, Tina appears in the live-action film &quot;&quot; (2006), portrayed by Jaime Pressly. She also appears in several stories in the gag comic series &quot;Dead or Alive 2 Comic Anthology&quot; by DNA Media Comics.

In Japanese, Tina was voiced by Mami Koyama in the first game, with Yūko Nagashima taking over the role for all subsequent game appearances. Meanwhile, starting with the release of &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme 2&quot; she is voiced in English by Kate Higgins, who performs her character with a Southern accent. In an interview with &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine, Koyama praised Tina&#x27;s strength and figure, feeling that the character would be popular with men. Nagashima by contrast grew heavily attached to the character, with Sakuda stating in an interview Nagashima was elated to voice the character again for her appearance in &quot;Venus Vacation&quot; due to the long period of time between it and &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot;.

==Promotion and reception==
To promote the first game&#x27;s release, Tecmo published cosplay guides for the female cast, and for the Sega Saturn version, they developed costumes based on the designs, hiring a cosplayer to portray Tina and partnering with publisher Dengeki Strategy King to compare the model and her in-game counterpart. At a release party to promote &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;, a variety of merchandise was released including pin-up posters, clothing items, and figurines featuring Tina. An in-game &quot;black bunny&quot; swimsuit for Tina was included with pre-orders of &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;. Other merchandise to promote the character has included 3D mouse pads, trading cards, and women&#x27;s swimwear. As part of a cross-promotion with Tecmo Koei, Sega featured Tina and other &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; characters on digital cards that were added to the PlayStation Vita release of their game &quot;Samurai &amp; Dragons&quot;.

Tina has been well received as a character since her debut, described by Paragon Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Dreamcast Magazine&quot; as &quot;the consummate&quot; babe of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;. Brazilian magazine &quot;SuperGamePower&quot;″s editor in chief expressed surprise when readers voted her their favorite female video game character among a wide selection, though understood why, praising her design for having &quot;thick legs and a lot of opulence&quot;. The staff of &quot;Kakuchopurei&quot; stated her moves and fighting style were &quot;in-your-face and graceful&quot;, comparing her to the character King of the &quot;Tekken&quot; series &quot;but with a svelte figure that somehow hits hard like a Mac truck .&quot; Additional praise was given for her wrestling stage outfits, particularly as the series progressed, and the allure of her Southern accent. Meanwhile, Mike Fahey of &quot;Kotaku&quot; praised her design change for &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;, calling her previous appearance &quot;a meaty amazon&quot; compared to her new &quot;lean, mean wrestling machine&quot; look.

Hiroyuki Endo of Japanese website &quot;Game Watch&quot; called her father-daughter dynamic with Bass one of the best aspects of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series, and further praised how he supported her privately as &quot;somehow warm and comforting&quot;. He was particularly glad to see her return in &quot;Venus Vacation&quot;, stating her &quot;activeness is still alive and well in this game&quot;, and additionally praised how her background as a model worked with the &quot;Xtreme&quot; titles, fitting the game&#x27;s &quot;dress up&quot; aspect through various outfits and swimwear while also bringing a sense of cuteness to her. Endo expressed that while there was a lot of emphasis on the character&#x27;s breasts, he found the hips in her character design more appealing, and enjoyed the humor in how her gameplay in the series allowed her to use them as a literal weapon against opponents, and furthermore called the proportions of her character design &quot;perfect from any angle&quot;.

Other Asian outlets offered similar praise. &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s Zenji Nishikawa stated she has &quot;a wild and unrestrained personality&quot;, enjoying her interactions with the other characters and further calling her &quot;cheerful&quot; and that &quot;just looking at her will make you feel better.&quot; &quot;Dengeki Online&quot; writer &quot;kbj&quot; stated that while he initially had a &quot;slightly flashy image&quot;, but upon seeing her revamped character design for &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot; he was surprised by her cuteness and how attractive she seemed, and felt games like &quot;Venus Vacation&quot; portrayed her actual personality as &quot;always positive and powerful.&quot; The staff of Chinese website &quot;Sina.com.cn&quot; meanwhile described her as a character &quot;embodies the undeniable toughness of a modern woman, the strength of a wrestler, and the determination to fight for her goals&quot;. They additionally shared Endo&#x27;s praise for her legs, stating that while they were &quot;slightly thick and slightly inconsistent with the gorgeous style&quot;, players appreciated them. They also stated her design helped offset what the felt was a jarring Japanese aspect of her aesthetic, which by itself made her less appealing to them than other characters in the series like the British Helena.

In a discussion with Takashi Kurokochi, orthopedic surgeon and director of the Yurakucho Cosmetic Surgery Clinic, Japanese magazine &quot;Game Criticism&quot; asked him to comment on female characters in fighting games and what made their designs particularly beautiful in the eyes of Japanese audiences, among them Tina and Helena. Kurokochi noted the emphasized lower jaw and cheekbones of their character designs, feeling it gave their faces a distinctive contour. He drew comparison to actress Audrey Hepburn as a prominent example of Western beauty, stating she had similar features but was not considered beautiful by Asian standards due to her small face. In contrast, Tina and Helena had more balanced facial features, something he felt helped set them apart.

===Regarding sexualization and impact===
Various publications were more critical of Tina&#x27;s appearance, such as the book &quot;The Psychology of Entertainment Media&quot;, which cited an image of her in a bikini as an example of a &quot;sexualized, objectified video game character&quot; and its impact on societal perception. The book &quot;Sex in Consumer Culture&quot; cited her as an example of a hypersexualized female character in video games often portrayed as having &quot;uncharacteristically large breasts and unusually small waists&quot;. In his review of &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;, &quot;National Post&quot; writer Matthew O&#x27;Mara noted that series newcomer Mila&#x27;s less sexualized design was the opposite of Tina&#x27;s, yet both characters &quot;suffer from the same sexist design choices&quot;. He particularly called out the decision to give Tina additional animations that &quot;make her breasts flop about while most of the other characters remain stationary&quot; alongside clothing options that emphasized this aspect, and felt it served to &quot;appeal to the lowest common denominator of who they think are playing the games: Men who stare at boobs.&quot; In contrast, Zachary Miller of &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; appreciated the attention to detail, citing Tina as one of the best examples of breast physics in modern gaming due to how naturally they reacted to clothing, though at the same time he felt they were unnatural on her model, particularly in how they should rest on the character&#x27;s chest, and this caused a similar feel with her animations.

Others offered a contrary point of view, such as the book &quot;Femme Fatalities&quot; that cited Tina as an example of a trend of strong action heroine characters introduced in video games, something the authors regarded as a response to a growing demographic of female gamers. Author Christopher B. Patterson cited her as an example of how the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series &quot;depicted the &#x27;cultural fragrance&#x27; of racial identities through a kawaii minimalism&quot;, noting how both she and Bass represent Japanese views of Southern American culture through their blonde hair and use of the American flag on their attire. He further stated that the series &quot;enhanced these stereotypes by dramatizing them with exhuberant personalities&quot; that integrated their national backgrounds into their fighting styles. He argued the sex appeal aspect also played into this and encouraged players to mentally associate her fighting technique with cultural &quot;fetish&quot;. Patterson further argued that elements such as sexualized attire, which included items such as a cow print bikini, helped illustrate her racial and cultural identity as an &quot;explicit pleasure&quot; for players to enjoy.

<text>Faggot, often shortened to fag, is a slur in the English language that was used to refer to gay men but its meaning has expanded to other members of the queer community. In American youth culture around the turn of the 21st century, its meaning extended as a broader reaching insult more related to masculinity and group power structure.

The usage of &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;faggot&quot; has spread from the United States to varying extents elsewhere in the English-speaking world (especially the UK) through mass culture, including film, music, and the internet.

==Etymology==
The first recorded use of &quot;faggot&quot; as a pejorative term for gay men was in the 1914 &quot;A Vocabulary of Criminal Slang&quot;, while the shortened form &quot;fag&quot; first appeared in 1923 in &quot;The Hobo&quot; by Nels Anderson.

The term faggot originated in late 16th-century English as an insult directed at women, particularly older women. Its association with homosexuality likely stems from linguistic patterns that use feminizing terms, such as &quot;nancy&quot;, &quot;sissy&quot;, and &quot;queen&quot;, to demean homosexual or effeminate men. The application of the term to old women is possibly a shortening of the term &quot;faggot-gatherer,&quot; applied in the 19th century to people, especially older widows, who made a meager living by gathering and selling firewood. It may also derive from the sense of &quot;something awkward to be carried&quot; (compare the use of the word &quot;baggage&quot; as a pejorative term for old people in general).

An alternative possibility is that the word is connected with the practice of fagging in British public schools, in which younger boys performed (potentially sexual) duties for older boys, although the word &quot;faggot&quot; was never used in this context, only &quot;fag&quot;. There is a reference to the word &quot;faggot&quot; being used in 17th-century Britain to refer to a &quot;man hired into military service simply to fill out the ranks at muster&quot;, but there is no known connection with the word&#x27;s modern usage.

The Yiddish word (), itself a pejorative term for a gay man, has been claimed by some to be related to the American usage. () is the nickname for a young girl named Faigie (&#x27;bird&#x27;) after Moses&#x27; wife Zipporah (Hebrew for &#x27;bird&#x27;). The similarity between the two words makes it possible that it might at least have had a reinforcing effect.

There is an urban legend, called an &quot;oft-reprinted assertion&quot; by Douglas R. Harper, creator of the Online Etymology Dictionary, that the modern slang meaning developed from the standard meaning of &quot;faggot&quot; as &quot;bundle of sticks for burning&quot; with regard to burning at the stake. Homosexuals were burned at the stake during the late Middle Ages as sexual intercourse between same-sex people was considered to be sodomy and therefore punished. The emergence of the slang term in 20th-century American English is unrelated to any historical death penalties for homosexuality; moreover, homosexuality in England and its colonies was never punished by immolation but instead by the accused being hanged and their property taken.

==Use==

===Early printed use===
The word &quot;faggot&quot; with regard to homosexuality was used as early as 1914, in Jackson and Hellyer&#x27;s &quot;A Vocabulary of Criminal Slang, with Some Examples of Common Usages&quot; which listed the following example under the word &quot;drag&quot;: &quot;All the fagots (sissies) will be dressed in drag at the ball tonight.&quot;

The word &quot;fag&quot; is used in 1923 in &quot;The Hobo: The Sociology of the Homeless Man&quot; by Nels Anderson: &quot;Fairies or Fags are men or boys who exploit sex for profit.&quot;

The word was also used together with another homophobic slur, &quot;bulldyke&quot;, by a character in Claude McKay&#x27;s 1928 novel &quot;Home to Harlem&quot;, indicating that it was used during the Harlem Renaissance. Specifically, one character says that he cannot understand: &quot;a bulldyking woman and a faggoty man&quot;.

===Use in the United Kingdom===
Originally confined to the United States, the use of the words &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;faggot&quot; as slurs for gay men has spread elsewhere in the English-speaking world, but the extent to which they are used in this sense has varied outside the context of imported US popular culture. In the UK and some other countries, the words &quot;queer&quot;, &quot;homo&quot;, and &quot;poof&quot; are much more common as pejorative terms for gay men. The word &quot;faggot&quot; in the UK also refers to a kind of meatball. In British English, &#x27;fag&#x27; is common slang for a cigarette, sometimes also used to describe a tedious task.

Use of &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;faggot&quot; as the term for an effeminate man has become understood as an Americanism in British English, primarily due to entertainment media use in films and television series imported from the United States. When Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews was overheard supposedly using the word in a bad-tempered informal exchange with a straight colleague in the House of Commons lobby in November 2005, it was considered to be homophobic abuse.

===Usage by youth===
Faggot, used as a discriminatory term, has expanded beyond gay men. It is often used by the youth in online communities to describe any queer person or someone who differs from the norm. In some cases, the term is completely unrelated to homosexuality and simply used as an insult due to its negative connotation, similar to gay.

Through ethnographic research in a high school setting, CJ Pascoe examined how American high school boys used the term &quot;fag&quot; during the early 2000s. Pascoe&#x27;s work, culminating in a 2007 book titled &quot;Dude, You&#x27;re a Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School&quot;, suggested that these boys used the &quot;fag&quot; slur as a way to assert their own masculinity, by claiming that another boy is less masculine; this, in their eyes, makes him a fag, and its usage suggests that it is less about sexual orientation and more about gender. One-third of the boys in Pascoe&#x27;s study claimed that they would not call a homosexual peer a &quot;fag&quot;, leading Pascoe to argue that &quot;fag&quot; is used in this setting as a form of gender policing, in which boys ridicule others who fail at masculinity, heterosexual prowess, or strength. Because boys do not want to be labeled a fag, they hurl the insult at another person. Pascoe felt the &quot;fag&quot; identity does not constitute a static identity attached to the boy receiving the insult. Rather, &quot;fag&quot; is a fluid identity that boys strive to avoid, often by naming another as the fag. As Pascoe asserts, &quot;[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize fag behavior and strive to avoid it.&quot;

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the word &quot;faggot&quot; became somewhat removed from its original meaning when used by youth, who commonly used it as a synonym for the word &quot;stupid&quot;. In a 2018 study completed by the Anti-Defamation League surveying Generation Z from Grade 6 and up, youth perspectives on the phrase &quot;that&#x27;s so gay&quot; and homophobic slurs highlight concerns over its use as a synonym for &quot;stupid,&quot; which respondents viewed as offensive and insensitive. Some believe it reflects a lack of awareness rather than intent to harm, yet it still evokes frustration and discomfort, pointing to a need for more thoughtful language.

===Use in popular culture===
There is a long history of using both &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;faggot&quot; in popular culture, usually in reference to gay and bisexual men. Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman&#x27;s 1995 documentary &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, based on Vito Russo&#x27;s book of the same name, notes the use of &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;faggot&quot; throughout Hollywood film history. The Think Before You Speak campaign has sought to stop &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; being used as generic insults.

====Theater====
In 1973, a Broadway musical called &quot;The Faggot&quot; was praised by critics but condemned by gay liberation proponents.

Larry Mitchell and Ned Asta&#x27;s 1977 cult book &quot;The Faggots and Their Friends Between Revolutions&quot; inspired a musical by composer Philip Venables and director Ted Huffman reinterprets world history from a queer perspective. The term is used in a sense of reclamation.

====Books and magazines====
Larry Kramer&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Faggots&quot; discusses the gay community including the use of the word within and towards the community. A description of Pamela Moore&#x27;s 1956 novel &quot;Chocolates for Breakfast&quot; in the Warner Books 1982 culture guide &quot;The Catalog of Cool&quot; reads: &quot;Her fifteen-year-old heroine first balls a fag actor in H&#x27;wood, then makes it with some hermetic, filthy rich, hotel-bound Italian count.&quot;

In its November 2002 issue, the &quot;New Oxford Review&quot;, a Catholic magazine, caused controversy by its use and defense of the word in an editorial. During the correspondence between the editors and a gay reader, the editors clarified that they would only use the word to describe a &quot;practicing homosexual&quot;. They defended the use of the word, saying that it was important to preserve the social stigma of gays and lesbians.

====Music====
=====1960s=====
Arlo Guthrie uses the slur in his 1967 signature song &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, noting it as a potential way to avoid military induction at the time (Guthrie had removed the word from live performances of the song in the 21st century).

Phil Ochs uses the slur in his 1969 song &quot;I Kill Therefore I Am&quot;. In the song, which is written from the point of view of a hateful police officer, he uses the slur to describe the student activists who protested the Vietnam War.

=====1980s=====

The Dire Straits 1985 song &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; makes notable use of the slur &quot;faggot&quot;, although the lines containing it are often excised for radio play, and in live performances by singer/songwriter Mark Knopfler. The song was banned from airplay by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council in 2011 but the ban was reversed later the same year. Ironically, the song in context makes it clear he is actually mocking the jealous and homophobic nature of the antagonist in the song by adopting a third-person point of view to show the irony, bigotry, and ignorance of the character.

In 1989, Sebastian Bach, lead singer of the band Skid Row, created a controversy when he wore a T-shirt with the parody slogan &quot;AIDS: Kills Fags Dead&quot;.

=====2000s=====

The 2001 song &quot;American Triangle&quot; by Elton John and Bernie Taupin uses the phrase, &quot;God hates fags where we come from.&quot; The song is about Matthew Shepard, a gay man from Wyoming whose 1998 murder brought national and international attention to hate crime legislation at both the state and federal level.

In December 2007, BBC Radio 1 caused controversy by editing the word &quot;faggot&quot; from their broadcasts of the Kirsty MacColl and The Pogues song &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;, deeming it potentially homophobic; however, the edit did not extend to other BBC stations, such as BBC Radio 2. Following widespread criticism and pressure from listeners, the decision was reversed and the original unedited version of the song was reinstated, with clarification from Andy Parfitt, the station controller, that in the context of the song the lyrics had no &quot;negative intent&quot;.

=====2010s–2020s=====
Eminem used the word in numerous works, such as &quot;Rap God&quot; (2013), along with an inflammatory lyric containing the term being removed from &quot;Fall&quot;.

A number of rappers have also used the slur in songs supporting the LGBT community. In 2012, Macklemore used the word &quot;faggot&quot; in the song &quot;Same Love&quot; in reference to the use of the homophobic slur in cyberbullying. Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s 2022 song &quot;Auntie Diaries&quot; is also supportive of the LGBT community; however, it sparked controversy for its repeated use of the slur, as well as for deadnaming his transgender uncle.

====Television====
In November 2009, the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;The F Word&quot; dealt with the overuse of the word &quot;fag&quot;. The boys use the word to insult a group of bikers, saying that their loud motorcycles ruined everyone else&#x27;s nice time. Officials from the dictionary, including Emmanuel Lewis, visit the town and agree that the meaning of the word should no longer insult homosexuals but instead be used to describe loud motorcycle riders who ruin others&#x27; nice times. The episode is a satire on the taboo of using the term, as it goes against political correctness.

==Reclamation==

Some LGBTQ+ individuals have reclaimed the term as a neutral or positive term of self-description. The reclamation of slurs focuses on reinforcing in-group solidarity, restricting the use of the reclaimed slur to members of the targeted group. 

In 2009, Erin Davies&#x27; car, displaying a Pride flag, was defaced with homophobic slurs resulting in a 58-day tour across the U.S. and Canada, keeping the graffiti as a conversation starter about LGBTQ+ experiences with intolerance. This journey led to her documentary &quot;Fagbug&quot;, an 80-minute film highlighting homophobia and the LGBTQ+ community&#x27;s resilience in reclaiming and addressing derogatory terms. Davies&#x27; work exemplifies LGBTQ+ culture&#x27;s longstanding efforts to transform slurs into tools for education and empowerment.

<text>A faggot, in the meaning of &quot;bundle&quot;, is an archaic English unit applied to bundles of certain items. Alternate spellings in Early Modern English include &quot;fagate, faget, fagett, faggott, fagot, fagatt, fagott, ffagott,&quot; and &quot;faggat&quot;. A similar term is found in other languages (e.g. Latin: &quot;fascis&quot;).

==Background==
Sometimes called a short faggot, a faggot of sticks equals a bundle of wood sticks or billets that is in length and in circumference. The measurement was standardised in ordinances by 1474. A small short faggot was also called a nicket. A brush-faggot (sometimes shortened to brush) was a bundle of similar size made of .

A long faggot of sticks equals a bundle larger than long. In a book on slang used at Winchester College fire-dogs were fire basket (andirons) that could hold long faggots, and half-faggots were smaller andirons that could only hold short faggots and were later converted for use with coal.

A long faggot was also called a kidd faggot, &quot;kid&quot;, &quot;kide&quot;, or &quot;kidde&quot; being Middle English for firewood in bundles.

A fascine (or bavin) is a type of long faggot which is approximately long and in diameter and used to maintain earthworks such as trenches.

A faggot was also a unit of weight used to measure iron or steel rods or bars totaling .

<text>Holmes Sterling Morrison Jr. (August 29, 1942 – August 30, 1995) was an American guitarist, best known as one of the founding members of the rock band the Velvet Underground, usually playing electric guitar, occasionally bass guitar, and singing backing vocals.

Unlike bandmates Lou Reed, Doug Yule, John Cale, Maureen Tucker and Nico, Morrison never released a solo album or made recordings under his own name. He was nevertheless an essential element of the group&#x27;s sound as a guitarist whose percussive and syncopated rhythm playing and melodic lead parts provided the foil for Lou Reed&#x27;s improvisational rhythm and lead guitar riffs.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Morrison was born on August 29, 1942, in the Long Island town of East Meadow, New York. He had two brothers and two sisters. His parents divorced when he was young and his mother remarried. He first met future Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker during childhood, through her brother Jim, who attended Division Avenue High School in Levittown, New York, with Morrison. Originally playing trumpet, Morrison switched to guitar after his teacher was drafted.

Morrison majored in English at the City College of New York. While visiting his friend Jim Tucker at Syracuse University, he met Lou Reed, a friend of Tucker and a fellow English student. Before Reed graduated in 1964, they met again in New York City in 1963. By this time, Reed had met John Cale and was interested in starting a band, so when they encountered Morrison, he was invited to join.

===The Velvet Underground (1965–1971)===

Reed, Cale, Morrison and percussionist Angus MacLise constituted the original line-up of the Velvet Underground, taking the name from Michael Leigh&#x27;s sadomasochistic novel of the same name. Reed sang and played guitar, Morrison played guitar, Cale played viola, bass and keyboards and MacLise was playing bongos, hand drums, tabla, tambourines and the cimbalom. MacLise was soon replaced by Maureen Tucker.

Morrison primarily played guitar on the band&#x27;s first two albums, although when Cale, the band&#x27;s usual bassist, played viola or keyboards in the studio or on stage, Morrison often filled in on bass. Some songs (including &quot;Heroin&quot; and &quot;Sister Ray&quot;) had Reed and Morrison on their usual guitars while Cale played viola and Vox Continental organ respectively, with no bass guitar.

There were at least three songs where Cale played both piano and bass while Reed and Morrison played guitars and these were &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;, &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; and &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; and two songs where Cale played both viola and bass with Reed and Morrison on guitars: &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; and &quot;The Black Angel&#x27;s Death Song&quot;, the former of which saw Cale doubling on piano. Although Morrison was a proficient bassist (as exemplified by his performances on &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; and &quot;Lady Godiva&#x27;s Operation&quot;), he disliked playing the instrument.

After Cale left the group in 1968, Morrison usually exclusively played guitar; however, photographic evidence indicates that he continued to play bass onstage for certain songs if Doug Yule, Cale&#x27;s replacement, was occupied with organ. Additionally, Morrison frequently sang backing vocals and the occasional lead vocal spot (he recited many verses of Reed&#x27;s poetry in &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot; and sang one line in &quot;I&#x27;m Sticking with You&quot;).

Morrison repeatedly remarked that &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, from the band&#x27;s debut album, was his personal favorite of all of The Velvet Underground&#x27;s songs, as he felt that the group had achieved with that one track, to a greater degree than any other, the sound the band had in mind.

In 1970, when the band was back in New York City to play an entire summer&#x27;s engagement at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, Morrison seized the opportunity to complete his undergraduate degree at the City College of New York. He remained in the Velvet Underground as lead guitarist after Reed left the band in acrimonious circumstances in August 1970. In 1971, however, he began graduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where he would earn a PhD in medieval literature (with a dissertation on the four signed poems of Cynewulf) in 1986. Morrison&#x27;s last performance with the band was on August 21, 1971, at Liberty Hall in Houston. When it was time for the band to return to New York, Morrison packed an empty suitcase and accompanied them to the gate of their departing plane, before finally telling them he was staying in Texas and leaving the band, the last founding member to quit.

===Post-Velvet Underground life (1971–1990)===

Morrison began to work on Houston tugboats as a deckhand to supplement his income in the mid-1970s; when he was forced to relinquish his teaching assistantship some years later, he was licensed as a master mariner and became the captain of a Houston tugboat, a vocation he pursued throughout the 1980s.

After leaving the Velvet Underground, Morrison&#x27;s musical career was primarily limited to informal sessions for personal enjoyment, though he played in a few bands around Austin, Texas, most notably the Bizarros. Morrison&#x27;s tenure in the capital of Texas made him a well-loved and admired member of the local music community as well as an influential voice. During John Cale&#x27;s renaissance in the late 1970s, Morrison occasionally sat in with his former bandmate on stages such as the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin. From the mid-1980s on, he occasionally recorded or performed with Cale, Reed, and particularly Tucker, who had by then started a solo career of her own. Morrison was part of her touring band for most of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

===Velvet Underground reunion===
In 1992, the core Velvet Underground line-up of Reed, Cale, Morrison and Tucker decided to reform for a tour and possible album. Morrison argued that Doug Yule, who had replaced Cale in 1968, should be included to fill out the sound, but Reed and Cale vetoed him. The band extensively toured Europe in 1993, alternatively as headline act or supporting U2. Morrison&#x27;s playing held up well, and his performances were generally agreed to be top-notch. But by the end of the tour, relationships had soured again and plans for a US tour and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album were scrapped and as a result, the European tour turned out to be the last for the Velvet Underground. Morrison joined Maureen Tucker&#x27;s band for a tour in 1994.

===Death===
In late 1994, Morrison was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma; and, as his health deteriorated, he could no longer play guitar. He was visited by his former bandmates Reed and Tucker; according to Reed, when he visited Morrison for the last time, he was bedridden, had lost weight and his hair, but never complained about his lymphoma and described it as &quot;leaves in the fall&quot;.

Morrison died of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma on August 30, 1995, one day after his 53rd birthday.

Morrison is buried at Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery.

===Legacy===
Upon their induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, Reed, Cale and Tucker performed a song titled &quot;Last Night I Said Goodbye to My Friend&quot;, which was dedicated to Morrison.
Doug Yule, another Velvet Underground member, wrote an obituary for Morrison following his death.

In March 2001, Morrison was remembered through a tribute set at the Austin Music Awards during the South by Southwest Festival. John Cale performed &quot;Some Friends&quot;, a song he had composed in Morrison&#x27;s memory, with Alejandro Escovedo, who played a song he wrote in 1995 called &quot;Tugboat&quot; which alludes to Morrison&#x27;s time spent as a tugboat captain at the Houston Ship Channel. An SXSW panel on Sterling successfully convened that year, with Cale and others remembering their friend. Morrison was also the subject of an oral history, &quot;Velvet Underdog&quot;, in &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; that year. The story utilised quotes by Cale, Reed, Tucker, and other Morrison associates.

Other songs that honor Morrison include the Galaxie 500 song &quot;Tugboat&quot; that alludes to Morrison&#x27;s post-Velvet Underground career. Morrison was a major influence on Dean Wareham.

===Personal life===
Morrison&#x27;s surviving family includes his widow, Martha (whom he married in 1971), his son, Thomas, and his daughter, Mary Anne, all of whom reside in Poughkeepsie, New York.

==Guitar style==
During the Cale era, Morrison primarily focused on rhythm guitar, although both Reed and Morrison did trade lead and rhythm guitarist roles. From the third album on though, Morrison almost always took the role of lead guitarist as Reed concentrated more on his singing and rhythm playing.

Morrison and Reed&#x27;s guitars were essentially duelling guitars that complemented each other, alternating between lead lines and rhythm parts interchangeably and with no assigned roles on who was lead or rhythm. Relative to Reed&#x27;s improvisational and experimental guitar style, Morrison&#x27;s guitar style was generally syncopated and more percussive with cleaner melodic lead parts. Praising his late bandmate&#x27;s guitar playing, Reed told David Fricke, &quot;Sometimes, I think his guitar playing is very much like his first name – sterling. It&#x27;s involved. And yet it has a grace and elegance to it, even in the fast-note runs. You could play me a hundred guitars, and I could spot Sterling.&quot;

Doug Yule, who joined the Velvet Underground later, stated that Morrison&#x27;s greatest influence as a guitarist was Mickey Baker, a blues and R&amp;B stylist known for &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;, a hit single from 1957 as part of Mickey and Sylvia.

==Songwriting credits==
While Reed was the main writer, there has been some conjecture that both Morrison and Cale made more songwriting contributions than is specified in the credits as Morrison later told Victor Bockris, &quot;Lou really did want to have a whole lot of credit for the songs, so on nearly all of the albums we gave it to him. It kept him happy. He got the rights to all the songs on Loaded so now he&#x27;s credited for being the absolute and singular genius of the Underground, which is not true. There are a lot of songs I should have coauthorship on, and the same holds true for John Cale. The publishing company was called Three Prong because there were three of us involved. I&#x27;m the last person to deny Lou&#x27;s immense contribution and he&#x27;s the best songwriter of the three of us. But he wanted all the credit, he wanted it more than we did, and he got it, to keep the peace.&quot; Nevertheless, Morrison got co-writing credits on &quot;European Son&quot;, &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot;, &quot;The Gift&quot;, &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, &quot;Hey Mr. Rain&quot;, &quot;Ride into the Sun&quot;, &quot;Foggy Notion&quot;, &quot;Ferryboat Bill&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Move Right In&quot;, &quot;Coney Island Steeplechase&quot; and &quot;Guess I&#x27;m Falling in Love&quot;. He also co-wrote &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; with Reed, the title track to Nico&#x27;s debut solo album.

<text>A horn loudspeaker is a loudspeaker or loudspeaker element which uses an acoustic horn to increase the overall efficiency of the driving element(s). A common form &quot;(right)&quot; consists of a compression driver which produces sound waves with a small metal diaphragm vibrated by an electromagnet, attached to a horn, a flaring duct to conduct the sound waves to the open air. Another type is a woofer driver mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure which is divided by internal partitions to form a zigzag flaring duct which functions as a horn; this type is called a &quot;folded horn&quot; speaker. The horn serves to improve the coupling efficiency between the speaker driver and the air. The horn can be thought of as an &quot;acoustic transformer&quot; that provides impedance matching between the relatively dense diaphragm material and the less-dense air. The result is greater acoustic output power from a given driver.

The narrow part of the horn next to the driver is called the &quot;throat&quot; and the large part farthest away from the driver is called the &quot;mouth&quot;. The angular coverage (radiation pattern) of the horn is determined by the shape and flare of the mouth. A major problem of horn speakers is that the radiation pattern varies with frequency; high frequency sound tends to be emitted in narrow beams with poor off-axis performance. Significant improvements have been made, beginning with the &quot;constant directivity&quot; horn invented in 1975 by Don Keele.

The main advantage of horn loudspeakers is they are more efficient; they can typically produce approximately 10 times (10 dB) more sound power than a cone speaker from a given amplifier output. Therefore, horns are widely used in public address systems, megaphones, and sound systems for large venues like theaters, auditoriums, and sports stadiums. Their disadvantage is that their frequency response is more uneven because of resonance peaks, and horns have a cutoff frequency below which their response drops off. (The cutoff frequency corresponds to the wavelength equal to the circumference of the horn mouth.) To achieve adequate response at bass frequencies horn speakers must be very large and cumbersome, so they are more often used for midrange and high frequencies. The first practical loudspeakers, introduced around the turn of the 20th century, were horn speakers. Due to the development in recent decades of cone loudspeakers which sometimes have a flatter frequency response, and the availability of inexpensive amplifier power, the use of horn speakers in high fidelity audio systems over the last decades has declined.

== Operation ==
An acoustic horn converts large pressure variations with a small displacement area into a low pressure variation with a large displacement area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the cross sectional area of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high acoustic impedance to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given displacement. Therefore, the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low displacement. The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually decompress and increase in displacement until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large displacement.

==Technology history==

The physics (and mathematics) of horn operation were developed for many years, reaching considerable sophistication before WWII. The most well known early horn loudspeakers were those on mechanical phonographs, where the record moved a heavy metal needle that excited vibrations in a small metal diaphragm that acted as the driver for a horn. A famous example was the horn through which Nipper the RCA dog heard &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;. The horn improves the loading and thus gets a better &quot;coupling&quot; of energy from the diaphragm into the air, and the pressure variations therefore get smaller as the volume expands and the sound travels up the horn. This kind of mechanical impedance matching was absolutely necessary in the days of pre-electrical sound reproduction in order to achieve a usable sound level.
===Megaphone===
The megaphone, a simple cone made of paper or other flexible material, is the oldest and simplest acoustic horn, used prior to loudspeakers as a passive acoustic amplifier for mechanical phonographs and for the human voice; it is still used by cheerleaders and lifeguards. Because the conic section shape describes a portion of a perfect sphere of radiated sound, cones have no phase or amplitude distortion of the wavefront. The small megaphones used in phonographs and as loudhailers were not long enough to reproduce the low frequencies in music; they had a high cutoff frequency which attenuated the bottom two octaves of the sound spectrum, giving the megaphone a characteristic tinny sound.
===Exponential===

The exponential horn has an acoustic loading property that allows the speaker driver to remain evenly balanced in output level over its frequency range. The benefits of the design were first published by C.R. Hanna and J. Slepian in 1924 for the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). A major drawback is that the exponential horn allows for a narrowing of the radiation pattern as frequency increases, making for high frequency &#x27;beaming&#x27; on axis and dull sound off axis. Another concern is that a throat of small diameter is needed for high efficiency at high frequencies but a larger throat is best for low frequencies. A common solution is to use two or more horns, each with the appropriate throat size, mouth size and flare rate for best performance in a selected frequency range, with sufficient overlap between the frequency ranges to provide a smooth transition between horns. Another solution tried in the late 1930s by Harry F. Olson of RCA was to use multiple exponential flare rates, either by connecting increasingly larger horns in series or by subdividing the interior of a single horn. Exponential horns continue to be used by some designers, and in some applications.
====Multicell====

A number of symmetrical, narrow dispersion, usually exponential horns can be combined in an array driven by a single driver to produce multicell horns. Patented in 1936 by Edward C. Wente of Western Electric, multicell horns have been used in loudspeakers since 1933 to address the problem of directivity at higher frequencies, and they provide excellent low frequency loading. Their directional control begins to beam both vertically and horizontally in the middle of their target frequency range, narrowing further at high frequencies with level changes as great as between lobes. Multicell horns are complex and difficult to fabricate and thus have a higher associated expense. They persisted in public address applications for many years because, even with their faults, they sounded very good, and still do with competent design. The revolutionary coaxial driver, the Altec Lansing Duplex 601 and 604, used a multicell horn for its high frequency component from 1943 to 1998.
====Radial, sectoral, and diffraction====

Radial horns have two surfaces based on an exponential flare rate, and two straight walls that determine the output pattern. The radial horn exhibits some of the beaming of the exponential horn. Altec sectoral horns were radial horns with vanes placed in the mouth of the horn for the stated purpose of pattern control. For ease in mounting to loudspeaker cabinets, flat front radial horns have been used, for instance by Community in their SQ 90 high-frequency horn. JBL&#x27;s diffraction or &quot;Smith&quot; horn was a variation on the radial design, using a very small vertical dimension at the mouth as a method of avoiding the mid-range horizontal beaming of radial horns that have a larger vertical dimension at the mouth.

The diffraction horn has been popular in monitor designs and for near-field public address applications which benefit from its wide horizontal dispersion pattern. Counterintuitively, the narrow vertical dimension provided for an expansive vertical output pattern approaching 90° for frequencies of a wavelength equal to the narrow vertical dimension. A very small version of the diffraction horn was designed in 1991 into the JBL model 2405H Ultra-High Frequency Transducer, yielding a 90° x 35° output pattern at .

===Tractrix===
The tractrix horn is very similar in many respects to the exponential horn and has gained adherents among DIY horn enthusiasts, audiophile consumers, and some manufacturers. It uses a curve formula derived by assuming that a tangent to any point on the horn&#x27;s inner curve will reach the central axis of the horn with a line segment of set length. At the mouth, the tangent line segment becomes perpendicular to the axis and describes the radius of the mouth. This horn concept was studied by Paul G.A.H. Voigt in the mid-1920s and patented in 1927. The size of the tractrix horn is generated by specifying the desired low frequency &quot;cutoff&quot; or limit which will determine the mouth diameter. Two incremental improvements over the exponential horn include slightly better support for low frequency extension and a somewhat broader high-frequency coverage pattern.

===Constant directivity===

In May 1975, to address problems of beamwidth changing at different frequencies, D. Broadus &quot;Don&quot; Keele, Jr. of Electro-Voice introduced a hybrid horn with an exponential expansion rate near the throat followed by a conical expansion section and ending with a rapidly flaring flange at the mouth. The flange at the mouth solved some remaining problems with lobing at higher frequencies. Don Keele specified in one version of his design a wider horizontal flare for pattern control appropriate to public address purposes. Keele&#x27;s paper set forth the relationships between mouth size, frequency and coverage angle, providing a basis for many future developments of horn design. One problem found with constant directivity horns is that the horizontal coverage pattern cannot be narrowed without making the vertical coverage pattern too small to be useful.
====Mantaray====
Subsequent to Keele&#x27;s work and using his principles, Clifford A. Henricksen and Mark S. Ureda of Altec designed a strikingly different hybrid horn displaying constant directivity traits, the horizontal diffraction or &quot;Mantaray&quot; horn. The Mantaray horn separates desired vertical coverage pattern from horizontal, making it possible to design horns for a variety of coverage patterns. The Mantaray shape starts with a vertically oriented JBL-style diffraction horn, leading into a conical waveguide (earliest designs), or a square or rectangular horn with four planar sides. For midrange beaming control, the outer mouth is expanded further with a short, flared flange in the Keele style, or with added planar sides of a greater flare angle. Low frequency efficiency is not as pronounced as the constant directivity design. Unlike previous designs, the apparent apex, which is the focal point of pattern dispersion, is not the same for every frequency, making for an ellipsoidal wavefront rather than spherical. Because of this, the Mantaray can only be arrayed satisfactorily in one plane (rather than multiple planes). Its abrupt breaks in flare rate causes diffraction, reflection and distortion components.

====Bi-Radial====

By 1980, Keele was at JBL where he took both his and Altec&#x27;s designs a step further. He mated a JBL-style diffraction horn to a secondary horn consisting of exponentially curved sides derived by using two radial formulas. This resulted in a hybrid constant directivity horn that was free from the distortion components associated with abrupt angle changes. The market responded well to the design in products such as the JBL model 4430 studio monitor with its 100° × 100° model 2344 Bi-Radial high frequency horn often called &quot;butt-cheeks&quot;. The Bi-Radial design had problems with apparent apex and arrayability in the same manner as the Mantaray.

====Twin Bessel====
Ramsa, the professional audio division of Panasonic Corporation, introduced a twin Bessel constant directivity horn shortly after the Mantaray appeared. The design was very similar to the Mantaray and the Bi-Radial but it used a dual series Bessel expansion formula to determine the flare rate of the secondary horn section.

====CD horn characteristics====
Most popular constant directivity horns (also known as CD horns) suffer from non-spherical wavefronts, limitations in arrayability, and distortion at high sound pressure levels as well as reflections and distortions related to the transition from diffraction slot to secondary horn. They tend toward a narrowing of dispersion pattern at the higher frequencies whose wavelengths approach the width of the throat or the width of the diffraction slot.

Because the CD horn&#x27;s high frequencies are more spread out over its coverage pattern, they appear attenuated relative to other horns. The CD horn requires an equalization boost of approximately per octave with a filter knee centered between 2 and (depending on horn design) in order to sound neutral and balanced. Most manufacturers of active electronic audio crossovers responded to this requirement by adding an optional CD EQ boost filter or high frequency shelf filter. For instance, such circuitry was provided via internal jumper links by BSS in their FDS-310 crossover and by Rane in their AC 22S and AC 23B crossovers. Rane allowed for greater front panel control of two bandpasses (&quot;hi-mid&quot; and &quot;high&quot;) using CD horn equalization including sweepable frequency range on their AC 24 crossover. Further refinements of the filtering process are available in DSP-based crossovers.

==== Hybrid Constant Directivity (HCD) ====
Firstly published in December 2019 in a Voice Coil article and then at the 148th AES Convention in June 2020, Dario Cinanni presented a new horns family.

The HCD algorithm, already used by SpeakerLAB Horn.ell.a software from 2006, transforms any expansion (exponential, hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, catenoidal, tractrix, spherical, or a new expansion) horn into a constant directivity horn.

The HCD permits to maintain the same acoustic load of the original expansion. HCD algorithm reduces reflections if compared to a CD horn, or in general to a multiflare horn, providing low distortion at high sound pressure levels.

Similar to the Radial horn HCD offers a constant directivity on one plane, to be specific a progressive constant directivity on the plane along the horn mouth major axis. The progression depends on the selected mouth-ratio. While on the plane along the mouth minor axis we will have an equivalent directivity contour of a circular mouth horn (using the same expansion).

===Multiple-entry horn===

In 1996, Ralph D. Heinz of Renkus-Heinz received a patent for a multiple-entry horn which incorporated multiple drivers for two bandpasses, high and mid, whose sound waves all exited into a single horn but at differing distances depending on the bandpass. It was marketed as the &quot;CoEntrant&quot; horn. The mid- and high-frequency drivers in the Renkus-Heinz ST/STX product line both exited through a &quot;Complex Conic&quot; waveguide. In the late 1990s, Thomas J. &quot;Tom&quot; Danley of Sound Physics Labs began working on a three-way multiple-entry horn, bringing the SPL-td1 to market in 2000. The design used seven drivers, with one high frequency driver at the horn&#x27;s throat, four mid-frequency drivers near the throat and two low frequency drivers ported closer to the horn mouth. In 2001, Tom Danley began developing the &quot;Unity&quot; horn for Yorkville Sound, patenting the improvement in 2002. Following the 2003 release of Yorkville&#x27;s Unity line, Danley formed Danley Sound Labs and developed a significant improvement over the SPL-td1 called the &quot;Synergy&quot; horn, yielding substantially better phase and magnitude response along with smoother polar pattern. The synergy horn design delivered greater power output from a smaller loudspeaker enclosure. Because the design retains pattern control through its crossover regions and over a large range of its total bandwidth, and because the acoustic center of the design is near the rear of the enclosure, it is more easily combined in arrays for public address applications.

===Waveguide horns===
The term &quot;waveguide&quot; is used to describe horns with low acoustic loading, such as conic, quadratic, oblate spheroidal or elliptic cylindrical horns. These are designed more to control the radiation pattern rather than to gain efficiency via improved acoustic loading. All horns have some pattern control, and all waveguides provide a degree of acoustic loading, so the difference between a waveguide and a horn is a matter of judgement.

===Quadratic-Throat Waveguide===
In 1999, Charlie Hughes of Peavey Electronics filed for a patent on a hybrid horn he called Quadratic-Throat Waveguide. The horn was basically a simple conic section but its throat was curved in a circular arc to match the desired throat size for proper mating to the speaker driver. Instead of increasing the horn mouth size with a flare to control midrange beaming, a relatively thin layer of foam covering the mouth edge was found to suit the same end. The QT waveguide, when compared to popular CD horns, produced about lower levels of second harmonic distortion across all frequencies, and an average of lower levels of the more annoying third harmonic distortion. Being without a diffraction slot, the QT waveguide was free from problems with apparent apex, making it arrayable as needed for public address purposes.

===Oblate spheroid waveguide===
Oblate spheroid waveguide (OSWG) horn designs improve directivity pattern control above 1 kHz, provide a lower frequency of directivity to better match the mid-range driver, and, as claimed by inventor Dr. Earl Geddes, mitigate higher order modes, a form of phase and amplitude distortion. The practical limitation of horn length is explicitly not addressed by the theory of OSWG.

== Applications ==
=== Public address and concert use ===
Horn loudspeakers are used in many audio applications. The drivers in horn loudspeakers can be very small, even for bass frequencies where conventional loudspeakers would need to be very large for equivalent performance. Horn loudspeakers can be designed to reproduce a wide range of frequencies using a single, small driver; to some extent these can be designed without requiring a crossover.

Horn loudspeakers can also be used to provide the very high sound pressure levels needed for sound reinforcement and public address applications, although in these high sound pressure applications, high fidelity is sometimes compromised for the sake of the necessary efficiency, and also for the controlled dispersion characteristics which are generally required in most large volume spaces. &quot;Gunness Focusing&quot;, a new method of counteracting some of the horn distortions, especially in the time domain, was pioneered by Dave Gunness while he was with Eastern Acoustic Works (EAW). EAW horn-loaded loudspeakers that have been processed with this proprietary system show reduced compression driver diaphragm/phase plug time-smear distortion while retaining high output power and controlled dispersion.

Concert venues often use large arrays of horn loudspeakers for high-volume bass reproduction (&quot;bass bins&quot; or subwoofers), in order to provide bass that concertgoers can not only hear but feel. Combining multiple horn loudspeakers in an array affords the same benefits as having a single horn with a greater mouth area: the low frequency cut-off extends lower as the horn mouth gets larger, and the array has the greater output power of multiple drivers.

===Commercial theaters===
Commercial cinema theaters often use horn-loaded loudspeakers for pattern control and increased sensitivity needed to fill a large room.

===Audiophiles and home use===
Consumer audio employs horn loudspeakers for controlled directivity (to limit audio reflections from room surfaces such as walls, floor, and ceiling) and for greater speaker sensitivity.

Horn loudspeakers can provide very high efficiencies, making them a good match for very low-powered amplifiers, such as single-ended triode amps or other tube amplifiers. After WWII, some early hi-fi fans went so far as to build low frequency horns whose mouths took up much of a wall of the listening room. The throats were sometimes outside on the lawn, or in the basement. With the coming of stereo in the 1960s, this approach was rarely seen. Many loudspeaker buyers and do-it-yourself loudspeaker fans sought smaller designs for aesthetic reasons.

Some audiophiles use horn loudspeakers for audio reproduction, while others eschew horn systems for their harmonic resonances, finding in them an unpleasant form of distortion. Since there are a variety of horn designs (of differing length, material, and taper), as well as different drivers, it is, to some extent, impossible to give such blanket characterizations to horn loudspeakers. Audiophiles using low power amplifiers, sometimes in the 5 to 25 watt range, may find the high efficiency of horn loudspeakers an especially attractive feature. Conversely, the high sensitivity can also make any background noise present at the amplifier outputs noticeably worse.

Film soundtracks have great dynamic range where peak levels are 20 dB greater than average levels. The high sensitivity of horn loudspeakers aids in achieving movie theater sound levels at the listening position with typical ~100 watts-per-channel receiver/amplifiers used in home cinema.

<text>Philip Dey Eastman (November 25, 1909January 7, 1986) was an American screenwriter, children&#x27;s author, and illustrator.

==Early life==
Eastman was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to Clarence Willis and Ann Hull (Dey) Eastman. After studying at Phillips Academy Andover and Williston Academy, he graduated from Amherst College in 1933 and later from the National Academy of Design in New York City.

==Career==

===Film and animation===

From 1936 to 1941, Eastman worked at Walt Disney Productions in assistant animation, story-sketch, and production design. From 1941 to 1942, he worked in the story department of Leon Schlesinger Productions, Warner Bros.&#x27;s cartoon unit, and was a member of Local Number Eight Hundred And Thirty-Nine of Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists, the trade union representing cartoonists in the United States.

In 1942, Eastman was drafted by the Army and assigned to the Signal Corps film unit, which was headed by Theodor Geisel, who later became known as Dr. Seuss. Here, Eastman conducted picture planning for animated sequences in orientation and training films, and he also wrote scripts and drew storyboards for the &quot;Private Snafu&quot; series for &quot;Army-Navy Screen Magazine&quot;.

From 1945 to 1952, Eastman worked at United Productions of America (UPA). He was a writer and storyboard artist for the &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; series. Eastman and Bill Scott co-wrote the screenplay for the animated comedy &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing,&quot; which won an Academy Award for Short Subject, Cartoons, in 1950. Eastman also directed educational films and worked on the Flight Safety series for the United States Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics while at UPA.

===Author and illustrator===
Eastman, a protégé and colleague of Theodor Geisel (pen name Dr. Seuss), wrote many books for children in his own distinct style. He worked with the Dr. Seuss brand of Random House, many of which were in the Beginner Books series. His titles include:
* &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; () (Beginner Book #18) (written and illustrated by)
* &quot;Go, Dog. Go!&quot; () (Beginner Book #20) 
* &quot;The Best Nest&quot; () (Beginner Book #51) (written and illustrated by)
* &quot;Flap Your Wings&quot; () (Early Bird Book, later reissued as Random House Pictureback Book formerly and Beginner Book #88 currently)
* &quot;The Cat in the Hat Beginner Book Dictionary&quot; () (Beginner Book) 
* &quot;What Time Is It?&quot; () (Bright and Early Board Books) - currently only available as an ebook
* &quot;Sam and the Firefly&quot; () (Beginner Book #6) (written and illustrated by)

* &quot;Aaron Has a Lazy Day&quot; () (Step into Reading level 1) adapted from &quot;Everything Happens to Aaron in the Summer&quot; (Take Along Books) 
* &quot;Aaron Loves Apples and Pumpkins&quot; () (Step into Reading level 1) adapted from &quot;Everything Happens to Aaron in the Autumn&quot; (Take Along Books)
* &quot;Aaron is Cool&quot; () (Step into Reading level 1) adapted from &quot;Everything Happens to Aaron in the Winter&quot; (Take Along Books)

He was the illustrator for:
* &quot;A Fish Out of Water&quot; adapted by Helen Palmer Geisel () (Beginner Book #23)
* &quot;Robert the Rose Horse&quot; by Joan Heilbroner () (Beginner Book #25)
* &quot;I&#x27;ll Teach My Dog 100 Words&quot; by Michael K. Frith () (Bright and Early Book #17, later reissued as Beginner Book in the United Kingdom)
* &quot;Go, Dog. Go!: P.D. Eastman&#x27;s Book of Things That Go&quot; () (Bright and Early Board Books, later reissued as Big Bright and Early Board Book)
* &quot;I&#x27;ll Teach My Dog a Lot of Words&quot; by Michael K. Frith () (Bright and Early Board Book)

He wrote but Eastman did not illustrate:
* &quot;Snow&quot; illustrated by Roy McKie () (Beginner Book #27)

His work is included in:
* &quot;The Big Red Book of Beginner Books&quot; () (I Want to Be Somebody New!: A Sequel to Put Me in the Zoo, Sam and the Firefly, Stop That Ball!, Robert the Rose Horse, The Very Bad Bunny, and The Digging-est Dog (1995, reprinted in 2010)
* &quot;The Big Blue Book of Beginner Books&quot; () (Put Me in the Zoo, A Fly Went By, Are You My Mother?, Go, Dog. Go!, The Best Nest and It&#x27;s Not Easy Being a Bunny) (1994, reprinted in 2008)
* &quot;The Big Purple Book of Beginner Books&quot; () (A Fish Out of Water, Snow, I&#x27;ll Teach My Dog 100 Words, Flap Your Wings, Big Dog...Little Dog and Fred and Ted Go Camping (2012) (his last work after his death in early 1986)

==Direct-to-video==
The P.D. Eastman collection was a series released by Random House. They are a video version of a &quot;book on tape&quot;. None of these productions are animated.

* &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; plus &quot;Go, Dog. Go!&quot; and The Best Nest

==Other affiliations==
Eastman was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union, Westport Artists, the Screen Cartoonists Guild, and the Audubon Society.

==Family==
In 1941 Eastman married Mary Louise Whitham of Glendale, California. He had two sons, Alan Eastman and Peter Anthony (Tony) Eastman, an animator, who himself directed video adaptations of Richard Scarry&#x27;s children&#x27;s books. Peter has also written and illustrated &quot;Fred and Ted Go Camping&quot; (2005), &quot;Fred and Ted Like to Fly&quot; (2007), and &quot;Fred and Ted&#x27;s Road Trip&quot; (2011), and contributed new illustrations to several reissues of his father&#x27;s books, &quot;The Alphabet Book&quot; (2000), &quot;Big Dog... Little Dog&quot; (2003), &quot;Red Stop! Green Go!&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Cat in the Hat Beginner Book Dictionary&quot; (2007).

<doc id="816304" wikidata="Q40889725" url="?curid=816304" title="History of the Jews in England">
<text>The history of the Jews in England goes back to the reign of William the Conqueror. Although it is likely that there had been some Jewish presence in the Roman period, there is no definitive evidence, and no reason to suppose that there was any community during Anglo-Saxon times. The first written record of Jewish settlement in England dates from 1070. The Jewish settlement continued until King Edward I&#x27;s Edict of Expulsion in 1290.

After the expulsion, there was no overt Jewish community (as opposed to individuals practising Judaism secretly) until the rule of Oliver Cromwell. While Cromwell never officially readmitted Jews to the Commonwealth of England, a small colony of Sephardic Jews living in London was identified in 1656 and allowed to remain. The Jewish Naturalisation Act 1753, an attempt to legalise the Jewish presence in England, remained in force for only a few months. Historians commonly date Jewish emancipation to either 1829 or 1858, while Benjamin Disraeli, born a Sephardi Jew but converted to Anglicanism, had been elected twice as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1868 and in 1874. At the insistence of Irish leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell, in 1846 the British law &quot;De Judaismo&quot;, which prescribed a special dress for Jews, was repealed.

Due to the rarity of anti-Jewish violence in Britain in the 19th century, it acquired a reputation for religious tolerance and attracted significant immigration from Eastern Europe. By the outbreak of World War II, about half a million European Jews fled to England to escape the Nazis, but only about 70,000 (including almost 10,000 children) were granted entry. Jews faced antisemitism and stereotypes in Britain, and antisemitism &quot;in most cases went along with Germanophobia&quot; during World War I to the extent that Jews were equated with Germans, despite the British royal family having partial German ethnic origins. This led many Ashkenazi Jewish families to Anglicise their often German-sounding names.

Jews in the UK now number around 275,000, with over 260,000 of these in England, which contains the second largest Jewish population in Europe (behind France) and the fifth largest Jewish community worldwide. The majority of the Jews in England live in and around London, with almost 160,000 Jews in London itself and a further 20,800 in nearby Hertfordshire, primarily in Bushey (4,500), Borehamwood (3,900), and Radlett (2,300). The next most significant population is in Greater Manchester with a community of slightly more than 25,000, primarily in Bury (10,360), Salford (7,920), Manchester itself (2,725), and Trafford (2,490). There are also significant communities in Leeds (6,760), Gateshead (3,000), Brighton (2,730), Liverpool (2,330), Birmingham (2,150), and Southend (2,080).

==Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England==
It is probable that there were Jews in Roman Britain under the Roman Empire, perhaps as soldiers, slaves, silversmiths or traders. However, there is little or no definitive evidence. One piece of circumstantial evidence is from a tradition in Caerleon (in Wales), a major legionary base, of two Roman era Christian martyrs, Julius and Aaron, with the name Aaron suggesting Jewish origin.

There is little reason to think that there was any settled Jewish presence in Anglo-Saxon England, although there is considerable discussion of the nature of Jewish religion and its relationship to Christianity in literature. The few references in the Anglo-Saxon Church laws relate to Jewish practices about Easter.

==Norman England, 1066–1290==

William of Malmesbury states that William the Conqueror brought Jews from Rouen to England during the Norman Conquest. William the Conqueror&#x27;s object may be inferred: his policy was to get feudal dues paid to the royal treasury in coin rather than in kind, and for this purpose it was necessary to have a body of men scattered through the country who would supply quantities of coin.

===Status of Jews===
Prior to their expulsion in 1290, the status of Jews in England was completely dependent on the will of the Crown. English Jews were legally under the jurisdiction of the king, who offered them protection in return for their economic function. As &quot;royal serfs&quot;, they were allowed freedom of the king&#x27;s highways, exemption from tolls, the ability to hold land directly from the king, and physical protection in the vast network of royal castles built to assert Norman authority.

The Jews of London were the responsibility of the Constable of the Tower and for this reason they were able to seek refuge in the Tower of London when at risk of mob violence. This was resorted to on a number of occasions, with large numbers staying there, sometimes for months at a time. There are records of a body of Jewish men-at-arms forming part of the garrison of the Tower in 1267, during a civil war.

A clause to that effect was inserted under Henry I in some manuscripts of the so-called &quot;Leges Edwardi Confessoris&quot; (&quot;Laws of Edward the Confessor&quot;). Henry granted a charter to Rabbi Joseph, the chief Rabbi of London, and his followers. Under this charter, Jews were permitted to move about the country without paying tolls, to buy and sell, to sell their pledges after holding them a year and a day, to be tried by their peers, and to be sworn on the Torah rather than on a Christian Bible. Special weight was attributed to a Jew&#x27;s oath, which was valid against that of twelve Christians. The sixth clause of the charter was especially important: it granted to Jews the right to move wherever they wanted, as if they were the king&#x27;s own property (&quot;sicut res propriæ nostræ&quot;). As the king&#x27;s property, English Jews could be mortgaged whenever the monarch needed to raise revenue and could be taxed without the permission of Parliament, eventually becoming the main taxpaying population.

English Jews experienced a &quot;golden age&quot; of sorts under Henry II in the late 12th century due to huge economic expansion and increased demand for credit. Major Jewish fortunes were made in London, Oxford, Lincoln, Bristol, and Norwich. The Crown, in turn, capitalized on the prosperity of its Jews. In addition to many arbitrary taxes, Richard I established the Ordinance of the Jewry in 1194 in an attempt to organize the Jewish community. It ensured that mandatory records would be kept by royal officials for all Jewish transactions. Every debt was recorded on a chirography to allow the king immediate and complete access to Jewish property. Richard also established a special exchequer to collect any unpaid debts due after the death of a Jewish creditor. The establishment of the Exchequer of the Jews eventually made all transactions of the English Jewry liable to taxation by the king in addition to the 10% of all sums recovered by Jews with the help of English courts. So, while the First and Second Crusades increased anti-Jewish sentiments, Jews in England went relatively unscathed beyond occasional fines and special levies. Though they did not experience the same kind of social mobility and cultural advancements that Jews under Muslim rule did, the Jews of England&#x27;s population and prosperity increased under the protection of the king.

The status of Jews in England dramatically worsened with the consolidation of governmental authority as well as the deepening of popular piety in the late 12th century; further isolating Jews from the greater English community. Though rulers of both church and state exploited and monopolized on the advancements in commerce and industry of English Jews, popular anti-Jewish sentiments grew as a result of their prosperity and relationship with the king and the courts. External pressures such as the circulating myth of the blood libel, the religious tensions in light of the Crusades, and the interference of Pope Innocent III in the late 12th century created an increasingly violent environment for English Jews. Mob violence increased against the Jews in London, Norwich, and Lynn. Entire Jewries were murdered in York. Because of their financial utility, however, English Jews were still offered royal protection, and Richard I continued to renew orders to protect the Jews, formalizing the Exchequer and designating &quot;archae&quot;, or centralized record chests monitored by panels of local Christian and Jewish key holders to better protect records of all Jewish transactions.

The incompetence of King John in the early 13th century depleted even the wealthiest Jews, and though they had more than a decade to recover, Henry III&#x27;s equally mismanaged finances pressed roughly 70,000 pounds out of a population of only 5,000. To do so, they had to sell off many of their mortgage bonds to wealthy nobles. The Jews then became a focal point of those debtors&#x27; hatred and mass violence spiked again in the mid-13th century. Their legal status, however, did not change until Henry&#x27;s son, Edward I, took control of the Jewries. He issued restrictive statutes, forbidding them from taking any more property into bond, the means by which they could lend money and how they lived. With almost all means of income denied them and property being confiscated, the Jewish population diminished. New waves of crusading zeal in the 1280s in conjunction with debt resentment pressured Edward into the expulsion of the depleted Jewish community in 1290.

===Attitudes of the kings and the church===
Gentile-Jewish relations in England were disturbed under King Stephen, who burned down the house of a Jew in Oxford (some accounts say with a Jew in it) because he refused to pay a contribution to the king&#x27;s expenses. In 1144 came the first report in history of the blood libel against Jews; it came up in the case of William of Norwich (1144). Anthony Julius finds that the English were endlessly imaginative in inventing antisemitic allegations against the Jews. He contends that England became the &quot;principal promoter, and indeed in some sense the inventor of literary anti-Semitism.&quot; In his 2010 book, Julius argues that blood libel is the key, because it incorporates the themes that Jews are malevolent, constantly conspiring against Christians, powerful, and merciless. Variations include stories about Jews poisoning wells, twisting minds, and buying and selling Christian souls and bodies.

While the Crusaders were killing Jews in Germany, outbursts against Jews in England were, according to Jewish chroniclers, prevented by King Stephen.

With the restoration of order under Henry II, Jews renewed their activity. Within five years of his accession Jews were found at London, Oxford, Cambridge, Norwich, Thetford, Bungay, Canterbury, Winchester, Stafford, Windsor, and Reading. Yet they were not permitted to bury their dead elsewhere than in London, a restriction which was not removed till 1177. Their spread throughout the country enabled the king to draw upon their resources as occasion demanded. He repaid them with demand notes on the sheriffs of the counties, who accounted for payments thus made in the half-yearly accounts on the pipe rolls (see Aaron of Lincoln). Strongbow&#x27;s conquest of Ireland (1170) was in part financed by Josce, a Jew of Gloucester; and the king accordingly fined Josce, five pounds, for having lent money to those under his displeasure, pipe rolls also indicate Strongbow borrowed monies from Aaron of Lincoln. As a rule, however, Henry II does not appear to have limited in any way the financial activity of Jews. The favourable position of English Jews was shown, among other things, by the visit of Abraham ibn Ezra in 1158, by that of Isaac of Chernigov in 1181, and by the immigration to England of Jews who were exiled from the king&#x27;s properties in France by Philip Augustus in 1182, among them probably being Judah Sir Leon of Paris.

In 1168, when concluding an alliance with Frederick Barbarossa, Henry II seized the chief representatives of the Jews and sent them to Normandy, and imposed a tallage on the rest of the community of 5,000 marks. When, however, he asked the rest of the country to pay a tithe for the Crusade against Saladin in 1188, he demanded a quarter of all Jewish chattels. The so-called &quot;Saladin tithe&quot; was reckoned at £70,000, the quarter at £60,000. In other words, the value of the personal property of Jews was regarded as one-fourth that of the whole country. It is improbable, however, that the whole amount was paid at once, as for many years after the imposition of the tallage, arrears were demanded from the recalcitrant Jews.

Aaron of Lincoln is believed to have been the wealthiest man in 12th century Britain. It is estimated that his wealth may have exceeded that of the king. The king had probably been led to make this large demand on English Jewry&#x27;s money by the surprising windfall which came to his treasury at Aaron&#x27;s death in 1186. All property obtained by usury, whether by Jew or by Christian, fell into the king&#x27;s hands on the death of the usurer; Aaron of Lincoln&#x27;s estate included £15,000 worth of debts owed to him. Besides this, Aaron&#x27;s large fortune passed to King Henry but much of it was lost on the journey to the royal coffers in Normandy. A special branch of the treasury, known as &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Exchequer&quot;, was established in order to deal with this large account.

During the earlier years of Henry II&#x27;s reign Jews lived on good terms with their non-Jewish neighbours, including the clergy. They entered churches freely, and took refuge in the abbeys in times of commotion. Some Jews lived in opulent houses, and helped to build many of the abbeys and monasteries of the country. However, by the end of Henry&#x27;s reign they had incurred the ill-will of the upper classes. Anti-Jewish sentiment, fostered by the Crusades during the latter part of the reign of Henry, spread throughout the nation and began to be reflected in official policy.

During the thirteenth century, English monarchs were increasingly careless and finally actively hostile in their policies. This was in part due to changes in church policy, which was becoming increasingly hostile after the Fourth Lateran Council. The church demanded the separation of Jews and Christians, so that heresy did not spread for instance by ensuring Jews could be identified by the wearing of Jewish badges or hats. 

John and Henry III both overtaxed the Jews, regarding them as an easy source of income. The result was that Jews were forced by the crown to pull in all overdue debts, and as debt was generally secured against land, this meant dispossessing members of the middling gentry of the source of their feudal status, land. The crown&#x27;s immediate allies, in their inner circle and court, benefited from these sales as they picked up these assets cheaply; Jews could not by law hold onto land holdings. This repeated cycle bred resentment and anti-Jewish sentiment, but monarchs continued this process until Jewish assets had in essence run out.

Henry III&#x27;s official attitudes moved from protection to hostility when he became the first monarch to lend credence to a blood libel, when he ordered investigations and arrests of Jews concerning the death of a child, Hugh, in Lincoln. He was locally venerated, and stories about him this clearly circulated widely, including in prose and folk songs.

===Persecution and expulsion===

The persecution of England&#x27;s Jews built up from the late twelfth century, and was brutal. Massacres were recorded in London, Northampton and York during the crusades in 1189 and 1190. The massacre at York was mentioned by William of Newburgh that it was carried out less for religious reasons, but instead for greed. 

In 1269, Henry III made blasphemy by Jews a hanging offence, and when Edward returned from Crusade, he passed the Statute of the Jewry in 1275. 

The number of Jews were around 2-3,000 in England by the 1270s. They were much less capable of generating income for the Crown, as they had been overtaxed and their capital was much eroded. Overtaxation inevitably led to overdue debts being foreclosed, meaning that the lands of middling Knights and gentry being bought up by the biggest landowners, notoriously including Queen Eleanor and other members of the court. This process had fuelled anti-Semitism among the forces opposing the crown centred around Simon de Montfort during Henry III&#x27;s time. During the Second Barons&#x27; War in the 1260s, de Montfort&#x27;s forces led a series of pogroms in many English cities where Jewish communities were attacked, and debt records captured and destroyed.

During Edward&#x27;s reign, anti-Semitism moved from being used by opponents of the crown, to being &quot;deliberately deployed and developed in the interests of the English state&quot;. While financial considerations may have played a part in his actions leading to the expulsion of the Jews, it is important to note Edward&#x27;s &quot;sincere religious bigotry&quot;. Shortly after Edward returned from the Crusades, in order to assuage concerns among the landed classes and in Parliament, he passed the Statute of the Jewry in 1275. 

To finance his war against Wales in 1276, Edward I of England taxed Jewish moneylenders. When the moneylenders could no longer pay the tax, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, Edward abolished their &quot;privilege&quot; to lend money, restricted their movements and activities and forced Jews to wear a yellow patch. 

On 17 November 1278 the heads of households of the Jews of England, believed to have numbered around 600 out of a population of 2-3,000, were arrested on suspicion of coin clipping and counterfeiting, and Jewish homes in England were searched. At the time, coin clipping was a widespread practice, which both Jews and Christians were involved in. A financial crisis had resulted in pressure to act against coin clippers. In 1275, coin clipping was made a capital offence, and in 1278, raids on suspected coin clippers were carried out. According to the Bury Chronicle, &quot;All Jews in England of whatever condition, age or sex were unexpectedly seized … and sent for imprisonment to various castles throughout England. While they were thus imprisoned, the innermost recesses of their houses were ransacked.&quot; Some 600 were detained in the Tower of London. More than 300 are known to have been executed in 1279, with 298 being killed in London alone. Some of those who could afford to buy a pardon and had a patron at the royal court escaped punishment.

Edward I increasingly showed antisemitism as in 1280 he granted a right to levy a toll on the rivulet bridge at Brentford &quot;for the passage of goods over it, with a special tax at the rate of 1d. each for Jews and Jewesses on horse, ½d. each on foot; other travellers were exempt&quot;. This antipathy eventually culminated in his legislating for the expulsion of all Jews from the country in 1290. Most were only allowed to take what they could carry. A small number of Jews favoured by the king were permitted to sell their properties first, though most of the money and property of these dispossessed Jews was confiscated. A monk, Gregory of Huntingdon, purchased all the Jewish texts he could to begin translating them, ensuring that at least some of what they had written and created was preserved.

From then until 1655, there is no official record of Jews in England outside the Domus Conversorum, with a few exceptions such as Jacob Barnet, who was ultimately arrested and exiled.

==Resettlement period, 16th–19th centuries==
Between the expulsion of Jews in 1290 and their formal return in 1655, there are records of Jews in the &quot;Domus Conversorum&quot; up to 1551 and even later. An attempt was made to obtain a revocation of the edict of expulsion as early as 1310, but in vain. Notwithstanding, a certain number of Jews appeared to have returned; four complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as Lombards were actually Jews.

Occasionally permits were given to individuals to visit England, as in the case of Elias Sabot (an eminent physician from Bologna summoned to attend Henry IV) in 1410, but it was not until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497 that any considerable number of Sephardic Jews found refuge in England. In 1542 many were arrested on the suspicion of being Jews, and throughout the sixteenth century a number of persons named Lopez, possibly all of the same family, took refuge in England, the best known of them being Rodrigo López, physician to Queen Elizabeth I, and who is said by some commentators to have been the inspiration for Shylock.

England also saw converts such as Immanuel Tremellius and Philip Ferdinand. Jewish visitors included Joachim Gaunse, who introduced new methods of mining into England and there are records of visits from Jews named Alonzo de Herrera and Simon Palache in 1614. The writings of John Weemes in the 1630s provided a positive view of the resettlement of the Jews in England, effected in 1657.
=== Henry VIII and Judaism ===
Over the course of his reign, Henry VIII showed interest in Judaism. During his attempt to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry&#x27;s representatives consulted with notable Italian Jews, and he attempted to justify his annulment using laws from the Old Testament. Later in Henry&#x27;s reign Hebrew was first printed in England from 1524, while in 1549 the use of Hebrew was allowed to be used in private worship.

===Hidden Jews in England===

From the beginning of the 16th century, in the wake of the Spanish Inquisition, Jews began to return to England. Although Jews had to conceal their religion for fear of raising discourse, they needed only to conceal it loosely, and many Jews in England became known as Jews, despite their attempts to conceal their faith. Many hidden Jews made names for themselves while in England. One Marrano from Spain, Hector Nunes, played a vital role in English espionage by relaying intelligence from Spain to Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s spymaster, Sir Francis Walsingham, on his merchant vessels. This information was instrumental in England&#x27;s defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Another Jew who made a name for himself in England was Joachim Gaunse of Bohemia, who came to England as a metallurgist and metal engineer to aid in their defeat of Spain. Because of his work, Sir Walter Raleigh invited Gaunse to sail with him on an expedition to North America, where he became the first Jew to set foot on North American soil.

Another Marrano gained attention in England for less patriotic reasons. Roderigo Lopez, who became personal physician to Elizabeth I, was allegedly bribed by the Spanish Crown to poison the Queen, and subsequently executed. This prompted a wave of anti-Jewish sentiment in England which had not been seen since the Jews&#x27; expulsion. In the wake of his trial, famous plays like William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot; were written, both of which depict Jews in negative, stereotypical manners.

Toward the middle of the 17th century a considerable number of Marrano merchants settled in London and formed there a secret congregation, at the head of which was Antonio Fernandez Carvajal and Samuel Maylott, a French merchant, who has many descendants in England. They conducted a large business with the Levant, East and West Indies, Canary Islands, and Brazil, and above all with the Netherlands and Spain.

Francis Drake&#x27;s quartermaster in his circumnavigation of the globe was named as &quot;Moses the Jew&quot;. There is evidence of Jews resident in Plymouth in the 17th century.

===Resettlement, 1655===
Prior to their resettlement, a growing philo-Semitism in England had turned the environment there into a more hospitable one for Jews. In the wake of the English Reformation, it became more popular for Anglicans to identify their practices and traditions with Jewish ones over Catholic ones. In 1607, Cambridge University received its first rabbi to teach Hebrew to students, and many of these students went on to translate the King James Bible. This translation of the Bible, for the first time, began to &quot;dehellenize&quot; biblical names For example, Elias, as he had been called previously, became Elijah to sound more like the Hebrew pronunciation. Many Puritans showed great appreciation for these Old Testament names, and Puritan children were often named using the new Hebrew spellings. Puritans furthered the English appreciation of Judaism by adopting Jewish practices like strict observation of the Sabbath. When they challenged Anglican practices as being too similar to Catholic ones, Richard Hooker, a well-known Anglican theologian, was cunning enough to tie these practices to Jewish ones rather than Catholic ones in an attempt to silence the Puritan reformers&#x27; attacks. At the turn of the 17th century, Englishmen like Edwin Sandys and Laurence Aldersey began to show interest in Jewish culture, traveling to Jewish ghettos, visiting synagogues on the Sabbath, and comparing Jewish and Anglican practices in popular writings upon their returns. Oliver Cromwell believed the English to be one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, and therefore entitled to the blessings promised in the Old Testament. Under his rule after the English Civil War, philo-Semitism flourished, making the climate right for Jews to propose their official readmission.
In the 1650s, Menasseh Ben Israel, a rabbi and leader of the Dutch Jewish community, approached Cromwell with the proposition that Jews should at long-last be readmitted to England. He agreed, and although he could not compel a council called for the purpose in December 1655 to consent formally to readmission, he made it clear that the ban on Jews would no longer be enforced. In the years 1655–56, the controversy over the readmission of Jews was fought out in a pamphlet war. The issue divided religious radicals and more conservative elements within society. The Puritan William Prynne was vehemently opposed to permitting Jews to return, the Quaker Margaret Fell no less passionately in favour, like John Wemyss, a minister of the Church of Scotland. In the end, Jews were readmitted in 1655, and, by 1690, about 400 Jews had settled in England. Emblematic of the progress in the social status of Jews was the knighting by William III of England in 1700 of Solomon de Medina, the first Jew to be so honoured.

===18th century===
The Jewish Naturalisation Act 1753 received royal assent from George II on 7 July 1753 but was repealed in 1754 due to widespread opposition to its provisions.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, the Jews had shown particular loyalty to the government. Their chief financier, Samson Gideon, had strengthened the stock market, and several of the younger members had volunteered in the corps raised to defend London. Possibly as a reward, Henry Pelham in 1753 brought in the Jew Bill of 1753, which allowed Jews to become naturalised by application to Parliament. It passed the Lords without much opposition, but on being brought down to the House of Commons, the Tories made a great outcry against this &quot;abandonment of Christianity&quot;, as they called it. The Whigs, however, persisted in carrying out at least one part of their general policy of religious toleration, and the bill was passed and received royal assent (26 Geo. 2. c. 26).

In 1798, Nathan Mayer von Rothschild established a business in Manchester, and later N M Rothschild &amp; Sons bank in London, having been sent to the UK by his father Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812). The bank funded Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars, financed the British government&#x27;s 1875 purchase of Egypt&#x27;s interest in the Suez Canal and funded Cecil Rhodes in the development of the British South Africa Company. Beyond banking and finance, members of the Rothschild family in UK became academics, scientists and horticulturalists with worldwide reputations.

Some English ports, such as Hull started to receive immigrants and trading &quot;port Jews&quot; from around 1750.

In the 1780s and &#x27;90s, English boxer Daniel Mendoza was an active prizefighter; Mendoza was of Sephardic or Portuguese Jewish descent.

===Emancipation and prosperity, 19th century===
With Catholic Emancipation in 1829, the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when William Huskisson presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of Liverpool. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by Robert Grant on 15 April of that year which was destined to engage the Parliament in one form or another for the next thirty years.

In 1837, Queen Victoria knighted Moses Haim Montefiore; four years later, Isaac Lyon Goldsmid was made a baronet, the first Jew to receive a hereditary title. The first Jewish Lord Mayor of London, Sir David Salomons, was elected in 1855, followed by the 1858 emancipation of the Jews. On 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild was finally allowed to sit in the British House of Commons when the law restricting the oath of office to Christians was changed; Benjamin Disraeli, a baptised Christian of Jewish parentage, was already an MP. In 1868, Disraeli became Prime Minister having earlier been Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1884, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild became the first Jewish member of the British House of Lords; again Disraeli was already a member. (Though born a Jew, Disraeli&#x27;s baptism as a child qualified him as eligible for political aspirations, presenting no restrictions regarding a mandated Christian oath of office.) Disraeli as a leader of the Conservative Party, with its ties to the landed aristocracy, used his Jewish ancestry to claim an aristocratic heritage of his own. His biographer Jonathan Parry argues: Disraeli convinced himself (wrongly) that he derived from the Sephardi aristocracy of Iberian Jews driven from Spain at the end of the fifteenth century...Presenting himself as Jewish symbolized Disraeli’s uniqueness when he was fighting for respect, and explained his set-backs. Presenting Jewishness as aristocratic and religious legitimized his claim to understand the perils facing modern England and to offer ‘national’ solutions to them. English toryism was ‘copied from the mighty [Jewish] prototype’ (&quot;Coningsby,&quot; bk 4, chap. 15). Disraeli was thus able to square his Jewishness with his equally deep attachment to England and her history. 

Nevertheless, Todd Endelman points out that, &quot;The link between Jews and old clothes was so fixed in the popular imagination that Victorian political cartoonists regularly drew Benjamin Disraeli (1804–81) as an old clothes man in order to stress his Jewishness.&quot; He adds, &quot;Before the 1990s...few biographers of Disraeli or historians of Victorian politics acknowledged the prominence of the antisemitism that accompanied his climb up the greasy pole or its role in shaping his own singular sense of Jewishness.&quot;

By 1880 the flourishing Jewish community in Birmingham was centred on its synagogue. The men organised collective action to defend the reputation and promote the interests of the community. Rituals regarding funerals and burials brought together the rich and the poor, the men and the women. Intermarriage outside the community was uncommon. However, the arrival of East European Jews after 1880 caused a split between the older, assimilated, middle-class Anglicized Jews and the generally much poorer new immigrants who spoke Yiddish.

By 1882, 46,000 Jews lived in England and, by 1890, Jewish emancipation was complete in every walk of life. Since 1858, Parliament has never been without practising Jewish members. At this time many of the Jews of the East End moved to more prosperous parts of East London such as Hackney (including Dalston and Stamford Hill), or to North London districts such as Stoke Newington and Canonbury.

Synagogues were built openly, occasionally across the country as large, architecturally elaborate classical, romanesque, Italianate or Victorian gothic buildings such as Singers Hill Synagogue, in Birmingham. However, not all grand examples survive: for instance Dalston Synagogue (counter-intuitively not in Dalston, but in Newington Green, North London) in the last-mentioned style was in poor repair so its congregation sold its land for building of an apartment block and relocated in 1970.

===All Jewish Rifle Volunteer Corps, 1861===
The invasion scare of 1857 saw the creation of the Volunteer Force which included both Engineer and Rifle Volunteer Corps. These units were raised by local communities with the permission of their local Lord Lieutenant.

The Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets, an area larger than the modern borough and which stretched from Stepney to Stamford Hill, was the Constable of the Tower. With his permission, Jews from East London formed the &quot;East Metropolitan Rifle Volunteers (11th Tower Hamlets)&quot;.

&quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; reported on the 165 Jewish volunteers, marching along with fife and drum as &quot;a sight never before seen in Britain, and very rarely if ever since the rising of Bar Cocba&quot;

Like most of the Volunteer Force units, the &quot;East Metropolitan Rifle Volunteers&quot; only existed for a short time before being merged with other (integrated) Tower Hamlets units, but their establishment stimulated debate in the Jewish community, at the time and subsequently, as to whether separate or integrated military units were more desirable.

==Modern times==

===1880s to 1920===

From the 1880s to the early part of the 20th century, massive pogroms and the May Laws in Russia caused many Jews to flee the Pale of Settlement. Of the East European Jewish emigrants, 1.9 million (80 percent) headed to the United States, and 140,000 (7 percent) to Britain. The chief mechanism was chain migration in which the first successful member(s) of the chain send information, local currency (and sometimes tickets or money for tickets) to later arrivals. These Ashkenazi Jews were funnelled by the railways of Europe to its North Sea and Baltic ports, and entered England via London, Hull, Grimsby and Newcastle. The Jewish communities of the Northern ports were swelled both by transient and temporary migrants, bound for New York, Buenos Aires, the Cape, as well as London and other British cities.

The Jewish population increased from 46,000 in 1880 to about 250,000 in 1919. They lived primarily in the large industrial cities, especially London, Manchester and Leeds. Until the late 20th century, East London was the main centre of Jewish life in England, with settlement heavily focused on an area in and around Whitechapel, extending from Bishopsgate to Cable Street. The area was chosen because of its cheap rents and the independent trades, notably weaving and textiles, known colloquially as &quot;the rag trade&quot;. The district of Spitalfields lay within this area and gained the nickname &quot;Little Jerusalem&quot;.

Manchester, and neighbouring Salford, were also areas of Jewish settlement, particularly the Strangeways, Cheetham and Broughton districts. Unlike much of the Jewish community in Poland, the Jewish community in England generally embraced assimilation into wider English culture. They started Yiddish and Hebrew newspapers and youth movements such as the Jewish Lads&#x27; Brigade. Immigration was eventually restricted by the Aliens Act 1905, following pressure from groups such as the British Brothers&#x27; League. The 1905 legislation was followed by the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act 1919.

In 1917, Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild set up the conditions for the Balfour Declaration, which promised a homeland in Palestine for Jews in a new Zionist State.

====Marconi Scandal (1912–1913)====
The Marconi scandal brought issues of antisemitism into the political arena, on the basis that senior ministers in the Liberal government had secretly profited from advanced knowledge of deals regarding wireless telegraphy. Some of the key players were Jewish. Historian Todd Endelman identifies Catholic writers as central critics:
:The most virulent attacks in the Marconi affair were launched by Hilaire Belloc and the brothers Cecil and G. K. Chesterton, whose hostility to Jews was linked to their opposition to liberalism, their conservative strand of Catholicism, and the nostalgia for a medieval Catholic Europe that they imagined was ordered, harmonious, and homogeneous. The Jew baiting at the time of the Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life and the challenges. What were seen as traditional English values.

Historian Frances Donaldson says, &quot;If Belloc&#x27;s feeling against the Jews was instinctive and under some control, Chesterton&#x27;s was open and vicious, and he shared with Belloc the peculiarity that the Jews were never far from his thoughts.&quot;

====First World War====
About 50,000 Jews served in the British Armed Forces during World War I, and around 10,000 died on the battlefield, while Britain&#x27;s first all-Jewish regiment, the Jewish Legion fought in Palestine. An important consequence of the war was the British conquest of the Palestinian Mandate, and the Balfour Declaration, making an agreement between the British Government and the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland to strive to set up a homeland for Jews in Palestine.

====Entrepreneurs====
The Eastern European Jews brought with them a long history as skilled entrepreneurial middlemen. They were much more likely to become entrepreneurs than their gentile neighbours, with a heavy concentration in the garment industry as well as in retailing, entertainment and real estate. London provided excellent financing opportunities for entrepreneurs.

====Sports====
Antisemitism was a serious handicap for Britain&#x27;s Jews, especially the widespread stereotype to the effect that Jews were weak, effeminate and cowardly. The Zionist social critic Max Nordau promoted the term &quot;muscle Jew&quot; as a rebuttal to the stereotype. Challenging that stereotype was an important motivation for wartime service in the Boer war and in the First World War. It was also motivation for sports that appealed to the largely working-class Jewish youth element.

From the 1890s to the 1950s, British boxing was dominated by Jews whose families had migrated from Russia or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Jews were heavily involved in boxing as professional and amateur fighters, managers, promoters, coaches and spectators—as well as gamblers and a certain criminal element that tried to fix fights. Their high visibility in a prestigious sport among the British working class helped reduce antisemitism and increased their acceptance in British society. The Jewish establishment worked hard to promote boxing among the youth, as a deliberate &quot;Anglicisation&quot; campaign designed to speed their adoption of British character traits and cultural values. The youth themselves eagerly participated, although the rising middle class status after the Second World War led to a sharp falloff of interest in younger generations.

The most celebrated of the Jewish athletes in Britain was Harold Abrahams (1899–1978)-– the man made famous by the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; for winning the gold medal in the 100 metre sprint in the 1924 Paris Olympics. Abrahams was thoroughly Anglicised, and his cultural integration went hand-in-hand with his sporting achievements. He became a hero to the British Jewish community. However, Abrahams&#x27; quest to enter upper class British society increasingly dominated his career, as his Jewishness meant less and less to him and his associates.

===Before and during World War II===

Though there was some growing antisemitism during the 1930s, it was counterbalanced by strong support for British Jews in their local communities leading to events such as the Battle of Cable Street where antisemitism and fascism was strongly resisted by socialists, trade unionists, Jews and their neighbours, who were successful in preventing a British Union of Fascists rally through a heavily Jewish area, despite police efforts to clear a path.

Consistent with its complex history, Britain was not particularly receptive to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi regime in Germany, and the other fascist states of Europe. Approximately 40,000 Jews from Austria and Germany were eventually allowed to settle in Britain before the War, in addition to 50,000 Jews from Italy, Poland, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Despite the increasingly dire warnings coming from Germany, Britain refused at the 1938 Evian Conference to allow further Jewish refugees into the country. The notable exception allowed by Parliament was the Kindertransport, an effort on the eve of war to transport Jewish children (their parents were not given visas) from Germany to Britain. Around 10,000 children were saved by the Kindertransport, out of a plan to rescue five times that number.

During the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands three Jews from Guernsey—Marianne Grunfeld, Therese Steiner, and Auguste Spitz—were deported to Saint-Malo, Nazi-occupied France, and eventually killed at Auschwitz concentration camp. They would be the only Jews deported from British soil and killed in the Holocaust.
With the declaration of war, 74,000 German, Austrian and Italian citizens in the UK were interned as enemy aliens. After individual consideration by tribunal, the majority, largely made up of Jewish and other refugees, were released within six months.

Even more important to many Jews was the permission to settle in the British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. In order to try to maintain peace between the Jewish and Arab populations, especially after the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, Britain strictly limited immigration. This limitation became nearly absolute after the White Paper of 1939 all but stopped legal immigration. During the War, Zionists organised an illegal immigration effort, conducted by &quot;Hamossad Le&#x27;aliyah Bet&quot; (the precursor of the Mossad) that rescued tens of thousands of European Jews from the Nazis by shipping them to Palestine in rickety boats. Many of these boats were intercepted and some sank with great loss of life. The efforts began in 1939, and the last immigrant boat to try to enter Palestine before the end of the war was MV &quot;Struma&quot;, torpedoed in the Black Sea by a Soviet Navy submarine in February 1942. The boat sank with the loss of nearly 800 lives.

Many Jews joined the British Armed Forces, including some 30,000 Jewish volunteers from Palestine alone, some of whom fought in the Jewish Brigade. Many formed the core of the Haganah after the war.

By July 1945, 228,000 troops of the Polish Armed Forces in the West, including Polish Jews, were serving under the high command of the British Army. Many of these men and women were originally from the Kresy region of eastern Poland and were deported by Soviet First Secretary Joseph Stalin to Siberia 1939–1941. They were then released from the Soviet Gulags to form the Anders Army and marched to Iran to form the II Corps (Poland). The Polish II Corps then advanced to the British Mandate of Palestine, where many Polish Jews, including Menachem Begin, deserted to work on forming the state of Israel, in a process known as the &#x27;Anders Aliyah&#x27;. Other Polish Jews remained in the Polish Army to fight alongside the British in the North Africa and Italy campaigns. Around 10,000 Polish Jews fought under the Polish flag – and British High Command – at the Battle of Monte Cassino. All of them were eligible to settle in the UK after the Polish Resettlement Act 1947, Britain&#x27;s first mass immigration law.

<text>Richard Kenneth Guy (30 September 1916 – 9 March 2020) was a British mathematician. He was a professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Calgary. He is known for his work in number theory, geometry, recreational mathematics, combinatorics, and graph theory. He is best known for co-authorship (with John Conway and Elwyn Berlekamp) of &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot; and authorship of &quot;Unsolved Problems in Number Theory&quot;. He published more than 300 scholarly articles. Guy proposed the partially tongue-in-cheek &quot;strong law of small numbers&quot;, which says there are not enough small integers available for the many tasks assigned to them – thus explaining many coincidences and patterns found among numerous cultures. For this paper he received the MAA Lester R. Ford Award.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Guy was born 30 September 1916 in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, to Adeline Augusta Tanner and William Alexander Charles Guy. Both of his parents were teachers, rising to the rank of headmistress and headmaster, respectively. He attended Warwick School for Boys, the third oldest school in Britain, but was not enthusiastic about most of the curriculum. He was good at sports and excelled in mathematics. At the age of 17 he read Dickson&#x27;s &quot;History of the Theory of Numbers&quot;. He said it was better than &quot;the whole works of Shakespeare&quot;, solidifying his lifelong interest in mathematics.

In 1935 Guy entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as a result of winning several scholarships. To win the most important of these he had to travel to Cambridge and write exams for two days. His interest in games began while at Cambridge where he became an avid composer of chess problems. In 1938, he was graduated with a second-class honours degree; he would later state that his failure to get a first may have been related to his obsession with chess. Although his parents strongly advised against it, Guy decided to become a teacher and got a teaching diploma at the University of Birmingham. He met his future wife, Nancy Louise Thirian, through her brother Michael, who was a fellow scholarship winner at Gonville and Caius. He and Louise shared loves of mountain climbing and dancing. They married in December 1940.

===War years===
In November 1942, Guy received an emergency commission in the Meteorological Branch of the Royal Air Force, with the rank of flight lieutenant. He was posted to Reykjavík, and later to Bermuda, as a meteorologist. He tried to get permission for Louise to join him but was refused. While in Iceland, he did some glacier travel, skiing, and mountain climbing, marking the beginning of another long love affair, this one with snow and ice. When Guy returned to England after the war, he went back to teaching, this time at Stockport Grammar School, but stayed only two years. In 1947 the family moved to London, where he got a job teaching mathematics at Goldsmiths&#x27; College.

===Later life and death===

In 1951 he moved to Singapore, where he taught at the University of Malaya until 1962. He then spent a few years at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, India. While they were in India, he and Louise went mountaineering in the foothills of the Himalayas. Guy moved to Canada in 1965, settling down at the University of Calgary in Alberta, where he obtained a professorship. Although he officially retired in 1982, he still went to the office five days a week to work, even as he passed the age of 100. Along with George Thomas and John Selfridge, Guy taught at Canada/USA Mathcamp during its early years.

In 1991 the University of Calgary awarded him an honorary doctorate. Guy said that they gave him the degree out of embarrassment, although the university stated that &quot;his extensive research efforts and prolific writings in the field of number theory and combinatorics have added much to the underpinnings of game theory and its extensive application to many forms of human activity.&quot; Guy and his wife Louise (who died in 2010) remained very committed to mountain hiking and environmentalism even in their later years. In 2014, he donated $100,000 to the Alpine Club of Canada for the training of amateur leaders. In turn, the Alpine Club has honoured them by building the &quot;Louise and Richard Guy Hut&quot; near the base of Mont des Poilus. They had three children, among them computer scientist and mathematician Michael J. T. Guy.

Guy died on 9 March 2020 at the age of 103.

==Mathematics==
While teaching in Singapore in 1960 Guy met the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős. Erdős was noted for posing and solving difficult mathematical problems and shared several of them with Guy. Guy later recalled &quot;I made some progress in each of them. This gave me encouragement, and I began to think of myself as possibly being something of a research mathematician, which I hadn&#x27;t done before.&quot; Eventually he wrote four papers with Erdős, giving him an Erdős number of 1, and solved one of Erdős&#x27; problems. Guy was intrigued by unsolved problems and wrote two books devoted to them. Many number theorists got their start trying to solve problems from Guy&#x27;s book &quot;Unsolved problems in number theory&quot;.

Guy described himself as an amateur mathematician, although his work was widely respected by professionals. In a career that spans eight decades he wrote or co-authored more than a dozen books and collaborated with some of the most important mathematicians of the twentieth century. Paul Erdős, John H. Conway, Donald Knuth, and Martin Gardner were among his collaborators, as were Elwyn Berlekamp, John L. Selfridge, Kenneth Falconer, Frank Harary, Lee Sallows, Gerhard Ringel, Béla Bollobás, C. B. Lacampagne, Bruce Sagan, and Neil Sloane.

Over the course of his career Guy published more than 100 research papers in mathematics, including four with Erdős.

Guy was influential in the field of recreational mathematics. He collaborated with Berlekamp and Conway on two volumes of &quot;Winning Ways&quot;, which Martin Gardner described in 1998 as &quot;the greatest contribution to recreational mathematics in this century&quot;. Guy was considered briefly as a replacement for Gardner when the latter retired from the Mathematical Games column at &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Guy conducted extensive research on Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, and in 1970, discovered the game&#x27;s glider. Around 1968, Guy discovered a unistable polyhedron with 19 faces; no such construct with fewer faces was found until 2012. As of 2016 Guy still was active in conducting mathematical work. To mark his 100th birthday friends and colleagues organised a celebration of his life and a tribute song and video was released by Gathering 4 Gardner.

Guy was one of the original directors of the Number Theory Foundation and played an active role in supporting their efforts to &quot;foster a spirit of cooperation and goodwill among the family of number theorists&quot; for more than twenty years.

==Chess problems==
From 1947 to 1951 Guy was the endings editor for &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot;. He is known for almost 200 endgame studies. Along with Hugh Blandford and John Roycroft, he is one of the inventors of the GBR code (Guy–Blandford–Roycroft code), a system of representing the position of chess pieces on a chessboard. Publications including &quot;EG&quot; use it to classify endgame types and to index endgame studies.

<doc id="816309" wikidata="Q463637" url="?curid=816309" title="Crotalus">
<text>Crotalus is a genus of pit vipers, commonly known as [[rattlesnake]]s or rattlers, in the family Viperidae. The genus is found only in the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina. The generic name &quot;Crotalus&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;krótalοn&quot;, which means &quot;rattle&quot; or &quot;castanet&quot;, and refers to the rattle on the end of the tail, which makes this group (genera &quot;Crotalus&quot; and &quot;Sistrurus&quot;) so distinctive. As of July 2023, 44 to 53 species are recognized as valid.

==Description==
Members of the genus &quot;Crotalus&quot; range in size from only (&quot;C. intermedius&quot;, &quot;C. pricei)&quot;, to over (eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes). In general, adult males are slightly larger than females. Compared to most snakes, they are heavy-bodied, although some African vipers are much thicker. Most forms are easily recognized by the characteristic rattle on the end of their tails, although a few island populations form exceptions to this rule: &quot;C. catalinensis&quot; has lost its rattle entirely, &quot;Crotalus lorenzoensis&quot; usually has no rattle, and both &quot;Crotalus ruber lucasensis&quot; and &quot;Crotalus estebanensis&quot; exhibit a tendency for rattle loss. The rattle may also be lacking in any species due to a congenital abnormality.

The rattle consists of a series of loosely interlocking hollow shells, each of which was at one point the scale covering the tip of the tail. In most other snakes, the tail tip, or terminal spine, is cone-shaped, hardly any thicker than the rest of the skin, and is shed along with it at each successive molt. In this case, the end scale, or &quot;button&quot;, is much thicker and shaped like a bulb, with one or two annular constrictions to prevent it from falling off. Before each molt, a new button will have developed inside the last one and before the skin is shed off its body, the tip of the new button shrinks, then loosening the shell of the previous one. This process continues so the succession of molts produces an appendage consisting of a number of interlocking segments that make an audible noise when vibrated. Since younger specimens may shed several times in a year at a frequency that depends on their environment and how much they eat, every time adding a new segment to the rattle, the number of segments is a function of more than solely the age of the snake. In theory, the rattle could become very long indeed, but in practice, the older segments tend to wear out and fall off. How quickly this happens depends on the snake&#x27;s environment, but end segments tend to break off after the rattle becomes about six or seven segments long; nonetheless, finding specimens with as many as a dozen segments is not uncommon⁠and in captive specimens, as many as 29 segments have been documented.

==Distribution and habitat==
The genus &quot;Crotalus&quot; is found in the Americas from southern Canada to central Argentina.

==Behavior==
No species of &quot;Crotalus&quot; is considered aggressive; when threatened, most retreat quickly, but most species defend themselves readily when cornered.

There is no consensus in the available literature about how far rattlesnakes can strike, with estimates ranging from one-third to the entire body length of the rattlesnake. Strike distance depends not just on the snake’s size, but also on many other factors, including its species, the position of its body, and its degree of agitation. This is compounded by a further lack of consensus as to the location on the anchor coil of the snake from where a strike should be measured. They rarely strike further than half of their body length, and almost never more than three-fourths, but trusting such values is unwise if only because it is not feasible to accurately judge the length of a coiled snake.

==Feeding==
The diets of species of &quot;Crotalus&quot; generally consist of vertebrates, although many invertebrate species are also consumed. Smaller species feed mainly on lizards, while larger species start by feeding on lizards as juveniles and then switch to preying mainly on mammals as adults. Prey items more frequently taken include rabbits, ground squirrels such as prairie dogs, tree squirrels, chipmunks, gophers, and rats and mice, while those less frequently taken include birds, snakes, and amphibians. Cannibalism has been reported in a number of different species. Individuals that feed on rodents usually release their prey after a strike to avoid their teeth, and these snakes evidently can discriminate between trails left by prey that has or has not been envenomated.

==Predators==
For all species of &quot;Crotalus&quot;, the most significant threats come from people, but they also face many natural enemies. These include other snakes, such as kingsnakes (&quot;Lampropeltis&quot;), coachwhips (&quot;Masticophis&quot;), indigo snakes (&quot;Drymarchon&quot;), and racers (&quot;Coluber&quot;); birds, such as hawks, eagles, owls, roadrunners, and ravens; and mammals, such as cats, coyotes, foxes, wildcats, badgers, skunks, and pigs. Certain species of birds frequently prey on these snakes, but this is not without risk. Two cases were reported in which dead hawks found near venomous snakes had suffered hemorrhage and gangrenous necrosis due to snakebite.

==Reproduction==
The genus &quot;Crotalus&quot; is ovoviviparous, giving birth to live young. The basic lifecycle of many Nearctic species has been known for quite some time. Females at an age of 26 months undergo vitellogenesis as they enter their third hibernation, mate the following spring, and give birth later in September or October.

Several variations to this basic cycle occur. In North America, the females of some species store sperm in their oviducts for at least eight months, and the males (all species of which undergo spermatogenesis during the summer) store sperm in the vas deferens for at least a year. Thus, species that store sperm for a shorter duration mate in the spring and store sperm in the vas deferens, while those that do so for a longer duration mate in the fall and store sperm in the oviduct over the winter, after which fertilization occurs the following spring. In addition, species that occur further north, where weather is colder during much of the year and the feeding and growing season is short, may reproduce only every other year or less. Those found in central and southern Mexico or the tropics have reproductive cycles that correspond mostly with the rainy season.

==Venom==
Two main hemotoxic effects are caused by rattlesnake venom. First, zinc-containing metalloproteases act upon capillary endothelial cells to inhibit platelet aggregation and hemorrhage. Second, the platelet antagonist crotalin creates a severe bleeding effect as it binds to the surface proteins, blocking aggregation.

Neurotoxic effects may also be caused by rattlesnake venom. These effects vary by species, and within species by population.

<text>:&quot;Common names: ground rattlesnakes, pygmy rattlesnakes, massasaugas&quot;

Sistrurus is a genus of pit vipers in the subfamily Crotalinae of the family Viperidae. The genus is endemic to Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Its generic name is a Latinized form of the Greek word for &quot;tail rattler&quot; (Σείστρουρος, &quot;seistrouros&quot;) and shares its root with the ancient Egyptian musical instrument, the sistrum, a type of rattle. Three species are currently recognized.

==Description==
&quot;Sistrurus&quot; species differ from the larger rattlesnakes of the genus &quot;Crotalus&quot; in a number of ways. They are smaller in size, but also their scalation is different: &quot;Sistrurus&quot; species have nine large head plates (same as &quot;Agkistrodon&quot;), whereas in &quot;Crotalus&quot; (and almost all other viperids), the head is mostly covered with a large number of smaller scales. &quot;Sistrurus&quot; species have a relatively small rattle that produces more of a high-pitched, buzzing sound than does a larger rattle, like that of &quot;Crotalus&quot;.

==Geographic range==
Species of &quot;Sistrurus&quot; are found in Canada, the Western, Southern, and Midwestern United States, and isolated populations in southern and eastern Mexico.

==Venom==
Although bites from &quot;Sistrurus&quot; species are regarded as less dangerous to humans than those from &quot;Crotalus&quot; rattlesnakes, primarily due to their lower venom yield, every venomous snake bite should be considered serious, and prompt medical treatment should always be sought.

==Species==

<text>Josuah Sylvester (1563 – 28 September 1618) was an English poet.

==Biography==

Sylvester was the son of a Kentish clothier. In his tenth year he was sent to school at King Edward VI School, Southampton, where he gained a knowledge of French. After about three years at school, he appears to have been put to business, and in 1591 the title-page of his &quot;Yvry&quot; states that he was in the service of the Merchant Adventurers&#x27; Company.

He was for a short time a land steward, and in 1606 Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales gave him a small pension as a kind of court poet. In 1613 he obtained a position as secretary to the Merchant Adventurers. He was stationed at Middelburg, in the Low Countries, where he died.

==Works==

He translated into English heroic couplets the scriptural epic of Guillaume du Bartas.
His &quot;Essay of the Second Week&quot; was published in 1598; and in 1604 &quot;The Divine Weeks of the World&#x27;s Birth&quot;. The ornate style of the original offered no difficulty to Sylvester, who was himself a disciple of the Euphuists and added many adornments of his own invention. The &quot;Sepmaines&quot; of Du Bartas appealed most to his English and German co-religionists, and the translation was immensely popular. It has often been suggested that John Milton owed something in the conception of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to Sylvester&#x27;s translation. His popularity ceased with the Restoration, and John Dryden called his verse &quot;abominable fustian.&quot;

His works were reprinted by A. B. Grosart (1880) in the &quot;Chertsey Worthies Library&quot;. See also Charles Dunster, &quot;Considerations on Milton&#x27;s early Reading&quot; (1800).

<text>Nimbin is a town in the Northern Rivers area of the Australian state of New South Wales, approximately north of Lismore, northeast of Kyogle, and west of Byron Bay.

Nimbin is notable for the prominence of its environmental initiatives such as permaculture, sustainability, and self-sufficiency, as well as the cannabis counterculture. Writer Austin Pick described his initial impressions of the village this way: &quot;It is as if a smoky avenue of Amsterdam has been placed in the middle of the mountains behind frontier-style building facades. ... Nimbin is a strange place indeed.&quot;

Nimbin has been described in literature and mainstream media as &#x27;the drug capital of Australia&#x27;, &#x27;a social experiment&#x27;, and &#x27;an escapist sub-culture&#x27;. Nimbin has become an icon in Australian cultural history, with many of the values first introduced there by the counterculture becoming part of modern Australian culture.

==History==
Nimbin and surrounding areas are part of what was known as the &quot;Rainbow Region&quot;, which was of cultural importance to the Indigenous Bundjalung people. The name Nimbin comes from the local Whiyabul (Widgibal) clan, whose Dreamtime speaks of the Nimbinjee spirit people protecting the area.

Forests of red cedar first attracted loggers to the area in the 1840s, but by the end of the century, most of the land had been cleared. With the cedar forests gone, Nimbin was subdivided in 1903, with the land turned over to dairy farming and growing bananas. 

In the 1960s, the local dairy industry collapsed due to recession and Nimbin went into serious economic decline until 1973, when the Aquarius Festival, a large gathering of university students, practitioners of alternative lifestyles, hippies, and party people, was held in the village. The festival was the first event in Australia that sought permission for the use of land from Aboriginal people and made a significant attempt at reconciliation. Since 1973, the area has been a haven for Australia&#x27;s counterculture. After the festival, hundreds of participants and festivalgoers remained in Nimbin to form communes and other multiple-occupancy communities, in search of an &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot;. Nimbin in fact made legal history for the first ever application of group title ownership of land in Australia. Since the Aquarius Festival, the region has attracted thousands of writers, artists, musicians, actors, environmentalists, and permaculture enthusiasts, as well as tourists and young families escaping city life.

Interviews were conducted in 1992 documenting the alternative lifestyle movement of Northern NSW in the 1970s, focusing on the town of Nimbin and the 1973 Aquarius Festival. Interviewees discussed how they arrived in Nimbin, their efforts at organising the Aquarius Festival, and the lasting impact the festival had on the township.

Architect and University of Sydney School of Architecture lecturer Col James, along with many of his students, was involved in a project designing low-cost housing in Nimbin in the 1970s. James promoted the idea of multiple occupancy (MO) homes, and this guide led to the flourishing of MOs in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales.

In 1979, the Nimbin community staged the &quot;Battle for Terania Creek&quot; to protect the remaining local rainforest. As a result, the New South Wales government imposed a &quot;no rainforest logging&quot; policy covering the entire state, the world&#x27;s first government legislation to protect a rainforest.

===Population decline===
The population of Nimbin before the failure of the dairy industry in 1961 was 6,020. In the , Nimbin had a population of 352, compared to 321 in the . The region&#x27;s high rural population (35 percent of Lismore residents, according to the census) means that Nimbin services a surrounding rural area of about ten thousand people living within . Nimbin had the highest unemployment rate in the Lismore Local Government Area in 2006, at 18.1 percent. Nimbin&#x27;s population in the was 468. The 2016 census published Nimbin&#x27;s population as 319, with local services provided by the City of Lismore (its area containing 45,000 people).

==Cannabis culture and MardiGrass==


In New South Wales, the cultivation, possession, or sale of cannabis is punishable by law. In Nimbin, cannabis is openly bought, sold, and consumed.

The existence of a drug culture in Nimbin since 1973 has been accompanied by a prevalence of collective and public creativity: colourful and spiritually motivated art (including large paintings above shop awnings), music, poetry, craft, and fashion can all be seen on the main street. The town is known as a hotspot for alternative social activities, grassroots political discourse, and the espousal of naturalist, humanist, anarchist, feminist, libertarian, permissive, new-age, mystical, and radical social philosophies (which can all be seen as collective creative endeavours).

To rally for an end to the prohibition of cannabis in Australia, Nimbin has held an annual MardiGrass festival since 1993. On the first weekend with any part of it in May, thousands descend on Nimbin for cannabis-oriented fun and frivolity. Activities include: a Prohibition Protest Rally and Parade with the Ganja Faeries, the Nimbin Cannabis Cup, the Hemp Olympix, which includes the &quot;Bong&quot;, &quot;Throw&#x27;n&#x27;Yell&quot;, Joint Rolling, and the Grower&#x27;s Iron Person event, where runners must first carry a sack of fertiliser, then a bucket of water, and finally &quot;the crop&quot;, as a tribute to the difficulties faced by growers in the hills, and to show that cannabis users can be fit and healthy. At night, entertainment ranges from the Harvest Ball and Picker&#x27;s Ball, rave doof parties, to poetry and jazz in local cafes.

There are a number of shops in Nimbin geared towards cannabis culture.
* The Nimbin Hemp Embassy is a &quot;soft entry point for drug information&quot; and a shop selling anything to do with hemp, except cannabis itself.
* Clothing and natural skin products using industrial hemp products.
* The Nimbin Hemp Bar used to allow patrons to smoke cannabis while enjoying fresh coffee and cake. In April 2008, the police announced their intention to close the Hemp Bar and Museum; landlords were sent letters to this effect. Rather than cause legal problems for their landlord, the Hemp Bar crew voluntarily closed their doors and moved out. The Hemp Bar reopened in 2009 as a coffee and hemp information centre, but smoking of cannabis is no longer encouraged.
* The Nimbin Museum was a collection of local artefacts, local art, and alternative culture open for viewing. The museum and two other buildings were destroyed in a fire on 13 August 2014.

===Police intervention===
The level of police intervention against drug trafficking has fluctuated over the years. In April 2008, a squad of 110 officers, six horses, and several police dogs conducted searches in a police operation. Several buildings were searched including the Hemp Embassy. Eight people were arrested, 72 people were issued cannabis cautions, and police seized of cannabis and cannabis cookies. The police sent letters to the Nimbin Museum and the Hemp Bar leaseholders indicating an intention to seek closure orders under the Restricted Premises Act of 1943 for the MardiGrass weekend. The Restricted Premises Act allows for the closure of premises for three days and orders may be obtained weekly. The museum reopened with a new leaseholder while the Hemp Bar remained closed for eight months and reopened in January 2009.

CCTV cameras in the main street of Nimbin had pushed dealing off the streets and into the museum, and the Hemp Embassy had been requesting that police deal with the problem. Following the raids, Hemp Embassy volunteer Andrew Kavasilas commented: &quot;This is a real slap in the face for people who would like to see other resources in town. We have been inviting the police to come down and sort out the dealing in the museum for years and this is their response. They could work with the community, but they&#x27;re not interested.&quot; Many locals voiced their opposition to the police operation. Following the operation, Richmond Police local area commander Superintendent Bruce Lyons vowed to &quot;shut down the drug trade.&quot;

==Accommodation and attractions==
A wide variety of accommodations are available for visitors, from campgrounds and backpacker hostels, to bush cabins and hotels.

Nimbin has a police station, hospital and medical centre, lawyers, real estate agency, service station with NRMA accreditation, restaurants, cafes, and a pub. The pub has an in-house restaurant. There are a number of sporting clubs and the bowling club maintains licensed premises. The Nimbin Neighbourhood and Information Centre (NNIC), run by local volunteer residents, offers visitors guides, computers for internet use, a small Centrelink office, legal advice, a nurse practitioner, a welfare worker, weekly soup kitchen in the adjacent park, and a publishing service for the local newspaper. Local attractions include the town hall, annual MardiGrass, markets, bands, walks to the mountains, and day-to-day activities from buskers to street stalls.

Other nearby attractions:
* Nimbin Rocks, a series of jagged outcrops, solidified plugs left after the erosion of volcanic dykes and vents, and Blue Knob, which are both landmarks for the village.
* Mount Warning (known to the Bundjalung people as Wollumbin, meaning &#x27;cloud catcher&#x27;) is about away. Named by James Cook as a maritime navigational indicator of dangerous offshore reefs, Mt. Warning&#x27;s summit is the first part of mainland Australia to receive light from each sunrise. Mount Warning is the remaining centre plug of a caldera which, 23 million years ago, had a 100-kilometre (62 mi) diameter. Its height was 1,156 metres (3,793 ft), nearly twice the height of Mount Warning today. The summit of Mt. Warning can be climbed via a , five-hour return walk through forested slopes.
* Nightcap National Park is one of the few remaining places to see the remnants of the Big Scrub rainforest.
* There are local creeks, water holes, and rivers for swimming.

==Media==
The &quot;Nimbin Good Times&quot; is a free monthly community newspaper, also distributed in Lismore, Byron Bay, and some suburbs of Brisbane and Sydney.

&quot;Nimbin Zone Magazine&quot; is Nimbin&#x27;s bi-monthly magazine, featuring creative and artistic people from the village and beyond. 
The community radio station 2NIMFM offers an independent alternative media voice and plays a diverse range of music and programming in Japanese, German, and the Bundjalung language.

==Politics==
Nimbin consistently delivers strong election results for progressive political parties. At the 2019 Australian federal election, the Greens topped the primary vote with 48%, followed by Labor at 29%, the Animal Justice Party with 9%, and the National Party, which won the wider seat of Page, with 6%. In the 2023 New South Wales election, Labor&#x27;s Janelle Saffin topped the vote in Nimbin, followed by the Greens candidate, with both polling more than six times the primary vote of the main conservative candidate from the Nationals.

==Churches==
* St Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church – A stone in a gate pillar records: Dedicated – to the Glory of God – and in loving memory of – the gates to St Mark’s are dedicated to the memory of Ernest Andrew McClelland, who died aged 68 years in 1954. They were donated by the McClelland family of Nimbin.
* St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church – This former church has been decommissioned and is now private property.
* St Stephen&#x27;s Presbyterian Church – The current Presbyterian church was built in 1922. For 50 years, home missionaries served the parish until the congregation welcomed its first ordained minister in 1959.
* Uniting Church – The former Nimbin Methodist Church became a Uniting Church in Australia parish with the Basis of Union, when most congregations of the Congregational Union of Australia, Methodist Church, and Presbyterian Church united in the 1970s. The building was designed and built by carpenter Eustace William Henry (Harry) Stanger (1875–1953). Stanger was born in Bathurst, New South Wales, and was educated at Newington College. In 1910, he moved to Nimbin and lived there until his death. With J. W. Bagust, he established moving pictures in the town and showed them for over forty years. As a carpenter, he was associated with the construction of many timber buildings in Nimbin. He was a founding member of the Nimbin Methodist Church Trust, and served as a circuit steward. He was a member of the Loyal Orange Lodge, the first greenkeeper for the Nimbin Bowling Club, and president of the Nimbin Progress Association.

<doc id="816338" wikidata="Q3432227" url="?curid=816338" title="Rolf Mellde">
<text>Rolf Mellde (1922 – March 2009) was an engineer who specialized in performance engines and also a car racing enthusiast.

==Early life==

Mellde&#x27;s grandfather August Johansson built one of the first cars in Stockholm and sold it to Lars Magnus Ericsson. Mellde&#x27;s father, Evald Johansson, taught car mechanics at a school in Stockholm. Following his father, Mellde started drawing turbo compressors and diesel engines at the age of ten.

After finishing his basic education, Mellde studied thermodynamics for two years at the &quot;Stockholms Tekniska Institut&quot; (STI) under Folke Mannerstedt (race driver and engine designer) and Nils Gustafsson. His first job was at Bergbolagen in Lindesberg that made engine powered inspection trollies. After that he worked two years at Skandiaverken in Lysekil working with two stroke boat engines.

==Work at Saab==
Mellde started working at SAAB in September 1946 and was put in charge of engine development.

In 1948, he started his competition career in a DKW in Skarpnäck. When he became head of testing, he suggested that SAAB participate in automotive competitions to show off SAAB&#x27;s engines. In 1950, SAAB entered the &quot;Rikspokalen&quot; and won. SAAB won eight times up to the final &quot;Rikspokalen&quot; in 1961.

In the 1960s it became harder to sell two stroke cars and Rolf Mellde went ahead with his idea to test a four stroke engine. They had tested several four strokers and the one that was best was the Ford V4. the board were invited to drive a test car but none of them wanted to. Tryggve Holm even thought the idea of a SAAB with a Ford engine was absurd. Lars Brising refused to state his opinion. The Saab management instead wanted him to continue working with the Saab 99.

Having no luck, Mellde talked with Marc Wallenberg who used to drive a Saab 92. Marc talked with his father and Rolf got the go ahead with the V4 engine. Even before the go ahead, Rolf had secretly visited Ford in Detroit and asked both Don Fray, then head of Ford US, and Fray contacted Robert McNamara, head of Ford, and he had nothing against selling the engine to Saab. The price would be the same Ford charged their own daughter companies.

The switch to the V4 was done under great secrecy. Just before the factory closed for the summer in 1966, a number of workers were asked if they were willing to work on some 96s that had &quot;faulty brakes&quot;. 40 workers volunteered and then Svante Holm explained that the real reason was that they would take the unsold cars and refit them with V4 engines. 600 cars were rebuilt and the V4 Saabs became a big hit and outsold the two-strokers by a factor of three.

==Work at Volvo==
Shortly after, Curt Mileikowsky came in from ASEA. Mileikowsky knew nothing about cars and Rolf left to work at Volvo after 25 years at SAAB. At Volvo, Rolf saw what was to be the replacement of the Volvo 140, a huge car powered by a cast V8 engine. Rolf quickly formed a group to work on the new 200-series, Jan Willsgård designed a new front and the V8 was changed to an inline 4. At Volvo he worked to improve safety and also worked on an experimental front wheel drive taxi cab. In 1979, he led the project team on the &quot;light component project&quot; (LCP) that produced the LCP2000 concept cars displayed at motor shows around the world in 1983.

<text>Sir John Houblon (13 March 1632 – 10 January 1712) was an English merchant and banker who served as the first governor of the Bank of England from 1694 to 1697. He also served as the Lord Mayor of London in 1695. 

==Early life==
John Houblon was the third son of James Houblon, a London merchant, and his wife, Mary Du Quesne, daughter of Jean Du Quesne, the younger. He had nine brothers and three sisters. The Houblon family were Huguenots from Lille and he later became an elder in the French Protestant Church of London in Threadneedle Street.

His younger brother, Abraham Houblon, was also Bank of England Governor, from 1703 to 1705. A daughter of Abraham Houblon, Anne, was married to Henry Temple, later Viscount Palmerston, in 1703. His older brother, James, an influential merchant and Member of Parliament for the City of London, was also a director of the Bank of England. Four other of his brothers were prosperous merchants.

==Career==
He became Sheriff of the City of London in 1689, an Alderman from 1689 to 1712, and Master of the Grocer&#x27;s Company from 1690 to 1691. He was Lord Mayor in 1695.

He was a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty from 1694 to 1699. It was during this time, from 1694 until 1697, that he served as inaugural governor of the Bank of England. He was again a Bank of England director from 1700, and a director of the New East India Company from 1700 to 1701.

He stood as a Parliamentary candidate for the City of London in 1701, but was defeated. Some sources state incorrectly that he was Member of Parliament for Bodmin.

===Appearance on banknotes===
Houblon has been commemorated by his appearance on the reverse of Series E £50 notes issued by the Bank of England. The notes were issued in 1994, the year of the Bank&#x27;s 300th anniversary. The design includes an image of Houblon&#x27;s house in Threadneedle Street, the site of the present Bank of England building. A new £50 note was brought into circulation in 2011, featuring James Watt and Matthew Boulton in place of Sir John Houblon. The Houblon note ceased to be legal tender on 30 April 2014.

==Personal life==
He married Mary Jurin in 1660, who came from a Flemish Protestant family and they had five sons and six daughters, but only two sons survived their father. They lived in a magnificent house just off Threadneedle Street on the site later occupied by the Bank of England and he also acquired a country house at High Ongar in Essex.

<text>First King of Shannara is a 1996 epic fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks.

==Plot summary== 

Horrified by the consequences of the First War of the Races, most of the Druids at Paranor stopped studying the arcane arts and turned to the sciences of the Old World.

Brona, now known as the Warlock Lord, had been behind the First War of the Races, and was thought to have died during it. But he had secretly survived, and now has come to make a new war upon the Races. He is now stronger than ever, gathering spirits from the netherworld and a massive Troll and Gnome army under his banner. Brona&#x27;s first target is Paranor, the home of the Druids who defeated him during the First War of the Races. He easily wipes out the Druid order.

The only survivors are the followers of Bremen, an outcast Druid who continued to study the mystic arts and tried to warn the council before it was too late. Bremen had been cast from the Druid Council because he had an interest in magic, now forbidden since the disaster that turned the Druid Brona into the Warlock Lord. As a result, the council didn&#x27;t trust him. Along with Tay Trefenwyd and Risca, who are the only Druids who believe Bremen and leave with him, Bremen leaves Paranor.

Later, the three are joined by Mareth, an apprentice Druid with innate magic, as well as empathic powers. After reaching the Hadeshorn and summoning the shade of Galaphile, Bremen is given four visions. Bremen learns that the Warlock Lord seeks the Black Elfstone, which would grant him tremendous power. Bremen sends Tay Trefenwyd to recover the Black Elfstone before the Warlock Lord can, and sends Risca to warn and aid the Dwarves from the army of the Warlock Lord.

Tay Trefenwyd, along with his best friend Jerle Shannara go to the king to seek his aid. However, the entire royal family is destroyed by the Warlock Lord&#x27;s minions, all but for two young grandchildren. Tay starts to go and search for the Black Elfstone, believing that action is better than inaction, taking with him Jerle Shannara, as well as a small party of Elven Hunters, and Preia Starle, who loves Jerle Shannara, but whom Tay Trefenwyd loves. However, Tay never even speaks of his love for her, as his loyalty to Jerle is so strong.

Tay eventually comes upon where the Black Elfstone is hidden, with an ancient race called the Chew Magna, who have been subverted by the magic of the Black Elfstone. Cloaking himself in magic that makes him one of them, Tay manages to recover the Black Elfstone. However, upon leaving the Chew Magna, they are discovered by the Warlock Lord&#x27;s minions, and Tay has no magic left, having spent it all recovering the elfstone.

Although he had been warned by Bremen on what would happen if the Black Elfstone is used, he uses it so that his friends can escape with the Black Elfstone. He destroys all the enemies, but is forced to sacrifice himself, drawing the air from his lungs rather than be subverted by the Black Elfstone. Meanwhile, Bremen, Kinson Ravenlock, and Mareth travel back to Paranor, fearing that the Druids are all already dead. On reaching Paranor, every Druid who remained is dead, and Bremen manages to recover the Eilt Druin, which he saw as pivotal in the creation of a weapon that can defeat the Warlock Lord.

Bremen knows that only magic can fight magic, so he devises a plan to create a magical weapon to destroy the Warlock Lord: the Sword of Shannara. Bremen learns how to make a metal stronger than iron from Cogline, and manages to create the sword by the mixing of science and magic. Upon finding a smith skilled enough to create the sword, the reader discovers that the smith is the ancestor of Panamon Creel. Bremen also discovers his successor as a Druid, the boy who is revealed to be Allanon, and possesses incredibly penetrating eyes, an immense intelligence, and a talent for magic.

The Sword is created by truth of existence, the only thing remaining to the shades of former Druids. The Warlock Lord could never face the truth that he had died centuries before, and the Sword would force that truth on him. Armed with truth, Bremen leads the battle in the Westland. He equips Jerle Shannara, the Elven King, with the Sword. After several battles, the Elves drive the Warlock Lord&#x27;s armies from the Westland, and right into a trap set by the remains of the Dwarf army. During the final battle, Jerle confronts the Warlock Lord, and manages to defeat him but he fails to destroy him. To properly wield the talisman of truth, one must first be prepared to face the truth of his own life. Jerle simply could not reconcile the guilt he felt at his best friend&#x27;s death, and so he lacked the ability to force truth on Brona. In this final battle, Risca is also killed.

Kinson Ravenlock and Mareth are married (with Mareth forsaking the Druid ways), as are Jerle Shannara and Preia Starle. Meanwhile, Bremen spends three years teaching Allanon what he needs to know in order to be a Druid. Afterwards, Bremen, in old age, succumbs to death, walking into the Hadeshorn, to be carried to the afterlife by the shade of Galaphile. Before he goes, he reveals to Allanon that the Warlock Lord was not destroyed, but simply forced into hiding, and that the task of destroying him will be given to Allanon.

<text>William Speirs Bruce (1 August 1867 – 28 October 1921) was a British naturalist, polar scientist and oceanographer who organised and led the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (SNAE, 1902–04) to the South Orkney Islands and the Weddell Sea. Among other achievements, the expedition established the first permanent weather station in Antarctica. Bruce later founded the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in Edinburgh, but his plans for a transcontinental Antarctic march via the South Pole were abandoned because of lack of public and financial support.

In 1892 Bruce gave up his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh and joined the Dundee Whaling Expedition to Antarctica as a scientific assistant. This was followed by Arctic voyages to Novaya Zemlya, Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land. In 1899 Bruce, by then Britain&#x27;s most experienced polar scientist, applied for a post on Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s Discovery Expedition, but delays over this appointment and clashes with Royal Geographical Society (RGS) president Sir Clements Markham led him instead to organise his own expedition, and earned him the permanent enmity of the geographical establishment in London. Although Bruce received various awards for his polar work, including an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen, neither he nor any of his SNAE colleagues were recommended by the RGS for the prestigious Polar Medal.

Between 1907 and 1920 Bruce made many journeys to the Arctic regions, both for scientific and for commercial purposes. His failure to mount any major exploration ventures after the SNAE is usually attributed to his lack of public relations skills, powerful enemies, and his Scottish nationalism. By 1919 his health was failing, and he experienced several spells in the hospital before his death in 1921, after which he was almost totally forgotten. In recent years, following the centenary of the Scottish Expedition, efforts have been made to give fuller recognition to his role in the history of scientific polar exploration.

== Early life ==

=== Home and school ===

William Speirs Bruce was born at 43 Kensington Gardens Square in London, the fourth child of Samuel Noble Bruce, a Scottish physician, and his Welsh wife Mary, née Lloyd. His middle name came from another branch of the family; its unusual spelling, as distinct from the more common &quot;Spiers&quot;, tended to cause problems for reporters, reviewers and biographers. William passed his early childhood in the family&#x27;s London home at 18 Royal Crescent, Holland Park, under the tutelage of his grandfather, the Revd William Bruce. There were regular visits to nearby Kensington Gardens, and sometimes to the Natural History Museum; according to Samuel Bruce these outings first ignited young William&#x27;s interest in life and nature.

In 1879, at the age of 12, William was sent to a progressive boarding school, Norfolk County School (later Watts Naval School) in the village of North Elmham, Norfolk. He remained there until 1885, and then spent two further years at University College School, Hampstead, preparing for the matriculation examination that would admit him to the medical school at University College London (UCL). He succeeded at his third attempt, and was ready to start his medical studies in the autumn of 1887.

=== Edinburgh ===

During mid-1887, Bruce travelled north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses in natural sciences. The six-week courses, at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth, were under the direction of Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson, and included sections on botany and practical zoology. The experience of Granton, and the contact with some of the foremost contemporary natural scientists, convinced Bruce to stay in Scotland. He abandoned his place at UCL, and enrolled instead in the medical school at the University of Edinburgh. This enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as Geddes and Thomson, and also gave him the opportunity to work during his free time in the Edinburgh laboratories where specimens brought back from the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition were being examined and classified. Here he worked under Dr John Murray and his assistant John Young Buchanan, and gained a deeper understanding of oceanography and invaluable experience in the principles of scientific investigation.

== First voyages ==

=== Dundee Whaling Expedition ===

The Dundee Whaling Expedition, 1892–93, was an attempt to investigate the commercial possibilities of whaling in Antarctic waters by locating a source of right whales in the region. Scientific observations and oceanographic research would also be carried out in the four whaling ships: &quot;Balaena&quot;, &quot;Active&quot;, &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Polar Star&quot;. Bruce was recommended to the expedition by Hugh Robert Mill, an acquaintance from Granton who was now librarian to the Royal Geographical Society in London. Although it would finally curtail his medical studies, Bruce did not hesitate; with William Gordon Burn Murdoch as an assistant he took up his duties on &quot;Balaena&quot; under Capt. Alexander Fairweather. The four ships sailed from Dundee on 6 September 1892.

The relatively short expedition—Bruce was back in Scotland in May 1893—failed in its main purpose, and gave only limited opportunities for scientific work. No right whales were found, and to cut the expedition&#x27;s losses a mass slaughter of seals was ordered, to secure skins, oil and blubber. Bruce found this distasteful, especially as he was expected to share in the killing. The scientific output from the voyage was, in Bruce&#x27;s words &quot;a miserable show&quot;. In a letter to the Royal Geographical Society he wrote: &quot;The general bearing of the master (Captain Fairweather) was far from being favourable to scientific work&quot;. Bruce was denied access to charts, so was unable to establish the accurate location of phenomena. He was required to work &quot;in the boats&quot; when he should have been making meteorological and other observations, and no facilities were allowed him for the preparation of specimens, many of which were lost through careless handling by the crew. Nevertheless, his letter to the RGS ends: &quot;I have to thank the Society for assisting me in what has been, despite all drawbacks, an instructive and delightful experience.&quot; In a further letter to Mill he outlined his wishes to go South again, adding: &quot;the taste I have had has made me ravenous&quot;.

Within months he was making proposals for a scientific expedition to South Georgia, but the RGS would not support his plans. In early 1896 he considered collaboration with the Norwegians Henryk Bull and Carsten Borchgrevink in an attempt to reach the South Magnetic Pole. This, too, failed to materialise.

=== Jackson–Harmsworth Expedition ===

From September 1895 to June 1896 Bruce worked at the Ben Nevis summit meteorological station, where he gained further experience in scientific procedures and with meteorological instruments. In June 1896, again on the recommendation of Mill, he left this post to join the Jackson–Harmsworth Expedition, then in its third year in the Arctic on Franz Josef Land. This expedition, led by Frederick George Jackson and financed by newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth, had left London in 1894. It was engaged in a detailed survey of the Franz Josef archipelago, which had been discovered, though not properly mapped, during an Austrian expedition 20 years earlier. Jackson&#x27;s party was based at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. It was supplied through regular visits from its expedition ship &quot;Windward&quot;, on which Bruce sailed from London on 9 June 1896.

&quot;Windward&quot; arrived at Cape Flora on 25 July where Bruce found that Jackson&#x27;s expedition party had been joined by Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen. The two Norwegians had been living on the ice for more than a year since leaving their ship &quot;Fram&quot; for a dash to the North Pole, and it was pure chance that had brought them to the one inhabited spot among thousands of square miles of Arctic wastes. Bruce mentions meeting Nansen in a letter to Mill, and his acquaintance with the celebrated Norwegian would be a future source of much advice and encouragement.

During his year at Cape Flora Bruce collected around 700 zoological specimens, in often very disagreeable conditions. According to Jackson: &quot;It is no pleasant job to dabble in icy-cold water, with the thermometer some degrees below zero, or to plod in the summer through snow, slush and mud many miles in search of animal life, as I have known Mr Bruce frequently to do&quot;. Jackson named Cape Bruce after him, on the northern edge of Northbrook Island, at 80°55′N. Jackson was less pleased with Bruce&#x27;s proprietorial attitude to his personal specimens, which he refused to entrust to the British Museum with the expedition&#x27;s other finds. This &quot;tendency towards scientific conceit&quot;, and lack of tact in interpersonal dealings, were early demonstrations of character flaws that in later life would be held against him.

=== Arctic voyages ===

On his return from Franz Josef Land in 1897, Bruce worked in Edinburgh as an assistant to his former mentor John Arthur Thomson, and resumed his duties at the Ben Nevis observatory. In March 1898 he received an offer to join Major Andrew Coats on a hunting voyage to the Arctic waters around Novaya Zemlya and Spitsbergen, in the private yacht &quot;Blencathra&quot;. This offer had originally been made to Mill, who was unable to obtain leave from the Royal Geographical Society, and once again suggested Bruce as a replacement. Andrew Coats was a member of the prosperous Coats family of thread manufacturers, who had founded the Coats Observatory at Paisley. 

Bruce joined &quot;Blencathra&quot; at Tromsø, Norway in May 1898, for a cruise which explored the Barents Sea, the dual islands of Novaya Zemlya, and the island of Kolguyev, before a retreat to Vardø in northeastern Norway to reprovision for the voyage to Spitsbergen. In a letter to Mill, Bruce reported: &quot;This is a pure yachting cruise and life is luxurious&quot;. But his scientific work was unabated: &quot;I have been taking 4-hourly observations in meteorology and temperature of the sea surface [...] have tested salinity with Buchanan&#x27;s hydrometer; my tow-nets [...] have been going almost constantly.&quot;

&quot;Blencathra&quot; sailed for Spitsbergen, but was stopped by ice, so she returned to Tromsø. Here she encountered the research ship &quot;Princesse Alice&quot;, purpose-built for Prince Albert I of Monaco, a leading oceanographer. Bruce was delighted when the Prince invited him to join &quot;Princesse Alice&quot; on a hydrographic survey around Spitsbergen. The ship sailed up the west coast of the main island of the Spitsbergen group, and visited Adventfjorden and Smeerenburg in the north. During the latter stages of the voyage Bruce was placed in charge of the voyage&#x27;s scientific observations.

The following year Bruce was invited to join Prince Albert on another oceanographic cruise to Spitsbergen. At Red Bay, latitude 80°N, Bruce ascended the highest peak in the area, which the prince named &quot;Ben Nevis&quot; in his honour. When &quot;Princesse Alice&quot; ran aground on a submerged rock and appeared stranded, Prince Albert instructed Bruce to begin preparations for a winter camp, in the belief that it might be impossible for the ship to escape. Fortunately she floated free, and was able to return to Tromsø for repairs.

== Marriage and family life ==

It is uncertain how Bruce was employed after his return from Spitsbergen in late 1899. In his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work, and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him temporary posts. Early in 1901 he evidently felt sufficiently confident of his prospects to get married. His bride was Jessie Mackenzie, who had worked as a nurse in Samuel Bruce&#x27;s London surgery. Bruce&#x27;s marriage took place in the United Free Church of Scotland, in Chapelhill within the Parish of Nigg on 20 January 1901, being attended and witnessed by their parents. Perhaps, due to Bruce&#x27;s secretive nature presenting limited details even among his circle of close friends and colleagues, little information about the wedding has been recorded by his biographers.

In 1907 the Bruces settled in a house at South Morton Street in Joppa near the coastal Edinburgh suburb of Portobello, in the first of a series of addresses in that area. They named their house &quot;Antarctica&quot;. A son, Eillium Alastair, was born in April 1902, and a daughter, Sheila Mackenzie, was born seven years later. During these years Bruce founded the Scottish Ski Club and became its first president. He was also a co-founder of Edinburgh Zoo.

Bruce&#x27;s chosen life as an explorer, his unreliable sources of income and his frequent extended absences, all placed severe strains on the marriage, and the couple became estranged around 1916. They continued to live in the same house until Bruce&#x27;s death. Eillium became a Merchant Navy officer, eventually captaining a Fisheries Research Ship which, by chance, bore the name &quot;Scotia&quot;.

== Scottish National Antarctic Expedition ==

=== Dispute with Markham ===

On 15 March 1899 Bruce wrote to Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, offering himself for the scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham&#x27;s reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, to apply for a scientific assistant&#x27;s post.

On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he &quot;was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship&quot;. He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a &quot;Scottish Expedition&quot;. This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: &quot;Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition [...] A second ship is not in the least required [...] I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started&quot;.

Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: &quot;If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable&quot;. Unappeased, Markham wrote back: &quot;As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step [...] without at least consulting me&quot;. He continued: &quot;You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself&quot;.

Bruce replied formally, saying that the funds he had raised in Scotland would not have been forthcoming for any other project. There was no further correspondence between the two, beyond a short conciliatory note from Markham, in February 1901, which read &quot;I can now see things from your point of view, and wish you success&quot;—a sentiment apparently not reflected in Markham&#x27;s subsequent attitude towards the Scottish expedition.

=== Voyage of the &quot;Scotia&quot; ===


With financial support from the Coats family, Bruce had acquired a Norwegian whaler, , which he transformed into a fully equipped Antarctic research ship, renamed &quot;Scotia&quot;. He then appointed an all-Scottish crew and scientific team. &quot;Scotia&quot; left Troon on 2 November 1902, and headed south towards Antarctica, where Bruce intended to set up winter quarters in the Weddell Sea quadrant, &quot;as near to the South Pole as is practicable&quot;. On 22 February the ship reached 70°25′S, but could proceed no further because of heavy ice. She retreated to Laurie Island in the South Orkneys chain, and wintered there in a bay he named Scotia Bay. A meteorological station, Omond House (named after Robert Traill Omond), was established as part of a full programme of scientific work.

In November 1903 &quot;Scotia&quot; retreated to Buenos Aires for repair and reprovisioning. While in Argentina, Bruce negotiated an agreement with the government whereby Omond House became a permanent weather station, under Argentinian control. Renamed Orcadas Base, the site has been continuously in operation since then, and provides the longest historical meteorological series of Antarctica. In January 1904 &quot;Scotia&quot; sailed south again, to explore the Weddell Sea. On 6 March, new land was sighted, part of the sea&#x27;s eastern boundary; Bruce named this Coats Land after the expedition&#x27;s chief backers. On 14 March, at 74°01′S and in danger of becoming icebound, Scotia turned north. The long voyage back to Scotland, via Cape Town, was completed on 21 July 1904.

This expedition assembled a large collection of animal, marine and plant specimens, and carried out extensive hydrographic, magnetic and meteorological observations. One hundred years later it was recognised that the expedition&#x27;s work had &quot;laid the foundation of modern climate change studies&quot;, and that its experimental work had showed this part of the globe to be crucially important to the world&#x27;s climate. According to the oceanographer Tony Rice, it fulfilled a more comprehensive programme than any other Antarctic expedition of its day. At the time its reception in Britain was relatively muted; although its work was highly praised within sections of the scientific community, Bruce struggled to raise the funding to publish his scientific results, and blamed Markham for the lack of national recognition.

== Post-expedition years ==

=== Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory ===

Bruce&#x27;s collection of specimens, gathered from more than a decade of Arctic and Antarctic travel, required a permanent home. Bruce himself needed a base from which the detailed scientific reports of the &quot;Scotia&quot; voyage could be prepared for publication. He obtained premises in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, in which he established a laboratory and museum, naming it the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, with the ultimate ambition that it should become the Scottish National Oceanographic Institute. It was officially opened by Prince Albert of Monaco in 1906.

Within these premises Bruce housed his meteorological and oceanographic equipment, in preparation for future expeditions. He also met there with fellow-explorers, including Nansen, Shackleton, and Roald Amundsen. His main task was masterminding the preparation of the SNAE scientific reports. These, at considerable cost and much delay, were published between 1907 and 1920, except for one volume—Bruce&#x27;s own log—that remained unpublished until 1992, after its rediscovery. Bruce maintained a wide correspondence with experts, including Sir Joseph Hooker, who had travelled to the Antarctic with James Clark Ross in 1839–43, and to whom Bruce dedicated his short book &quot;Polar Exploration&quot;.

In 1914 discussions began toward finding more permanent homes, both for Bruce&#x27;s collection and, following the death that year of oceanographer Sir John Murray, for the specimens and library of the Challenger expedition. Bruce proposed that a new centre should be created as a memorial to Murray. There was unanimous agreement to proceed, but the project was curtailed by the outbreak of war, and not revived. The Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory continued until 1919, when Bruce, in poor health, was forced to close it, dispersing its contents to the Royal Scottish Museum, the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), and the University of Edinburgh.

=== Further Antarctic plans ===

On 17 March 1910 Bruce presented proposals to the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS) for a new Scottish Antarctic expedition. His plan envisaged a party wintering in or near Coats Land, while the ship took another group to the Ross Sea, on the opposite side of the continent. During the second season the Coats Land party would cross the continent on foot, via the South Pole, while the Ross Sea party pushed south to meet them and assist them home. The expedition would also carry out extensive oceanographical and other scientific work. Bruce estimated that the total cost would be about £50,000 (2025 value about £).

The RSGS supported these proposals, as did the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the University of Edinburgh, and other Scottish organisations, but the timing was wrong; the Royal Geographical Society in London was fully occupied with Robert Scott&#x27;s Terra Nova Expedition, and showed no interest in Bruce&#x27;s plans. No rich private benefactors came forward, and persistent and intensive lobbying of the government for financial backing failed. Bruce suspected that his efforts were, as usual, being undermined by the aged but still influential Markham. Finally accepting that his venture would not take place, he gave generous support and advice to Ernest Shackleton, who in 1913 announced plans, similar to Bruce&#x27;s, for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Shackleton not only received £10,000 from the government, but raised large sums from private sources, including £24,000 from Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird of Dundee.

Shackleton&#x27;s expedition was an epic adventure, but failed completely in its main endeavour of a transcontinental crossing. Bruce was not consulted by the Shackleton relief committee about that expedition&#x27;s rescue, when the need arose in 1916. &quot;Myself, I suppose,&quot; he wrote, &quot;because of being north of the Tweed, they think dead&quot;.

=== Scottish Spitsbergen syndicate ===
During his Spitsbergen visits with Prince Albert in 1898 and 1899, Bruce had detected the presence of coal, gypsum and possibly oil. In the summers of 1906 and 1907 he again accompanied the Prince to the archipelago, with the primary purpose of surveying and mapping Prince Charles Foreland, an island unvisited during the earlier voyages. Here Bruce found further deposits of coal, and indications of iron. On the basis of these finds, Bruce set up a mineral prospecting company, the Scottish Spitsbergen Syndicate, in July 1909.

At that time, in international law Spitsbergen was regarded as &quot;terra nullius&quot;—rights to mine and extract could be established simply by registering a claim. Bruce&#x27;s syndicate registered claims on Prince Charles Foreland and on the islands of Barentsøya and Edgeøya, among other areas. A sum of £4,000 (out of a target of £6,000) was subscribed to finance the costs of a detailed prospecting expedition in 1909, in a chartered vessel with a full scientific team. The results were &quot;disappointing&quot;, and the voyage absorbed almost all of the syndicate&#x27;s funds.

Bruce paid two further visits to Spitsbergen, in 1912 and 1914, but the outbreak of war prevented further immediate developments. Early in 1919 the old syndicate was replaced by a larger and better-financed company. Bruce had now fixed his main hopes on the discovery of oil, but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence; substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered. Thereafter Bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement. The new company had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures, and although it continued to exist, under various ownerships, until 1952, there is no record of profitable extraction. Its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern.

== Later life ==
=== Polar Medals withheld ===
During his lifetime Bruce received many awards: the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1904; the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1910; the Neill prize and Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1913, and the Livingstone Medal of the American Geographical Society in 1920. He also received an honorary LLD degree from the University of Aberdeen. The honour that eluded him was the Polar Medal, awarded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Royal Geographical Society. The Medal was awarded to the members of every other British or Commonwealth Antarctic expedition during the early 20th century, but the SNAE was the exception; the medal was withheld.

Bruce, and those close to him, blamed Markham for this omission. The matter was raised, repeatedly, with anyone thought to have influence. Robert Rudmose Brown, chronicler of the &quot;Scotia&quot; voyage and later Bruce&#x27;s first biographer, wrote in a 1913 letter to the President of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society that this neglect was &quot;a slight to Scotland and to Scottish endeavour&quot;. Bruce wrote in March 1915 to the President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, who agreed in his reply that &quot;Markham had much to answer for&quot;. After Markham&#x27;s death in 1916 Bruce sent a long letter to his Member of Parliament, Charles Price, detailing Sir Clements&#x27;s malice towards him and the Scottish expedition, ending with a heartfelt cry on behalf of his old comrades: &quot;Robertson is dying without his well won white ribbon! The Mate is dead!! The Chief Engineer is dead!!! Everyone as good men as have ever served on any Polar Expedition, yet they did not receive the white ribbon.&quot; No action followed this plea.

No award had been made nearly a century later, when the matter was raised in the Scottish Parliament. On 4 November 2002 MSP Michael Russell tabled a motion relating to the SNAE centenary, which concluded: &quot;The Polar Medal Advisory Committee should recommend the posthumous award of the Polar Medal to Dr William Speirs Bruce, in recognition of his status as one of the key figures in early 20th century polar scientific exploration&quot;.

=== Last years ===
After the outbreak of war in 1914, Bruce&#x27;s prospecting ventures were on hold. He offered his services to the Admiralty, but failed to obtain an appointment. In 1915 he accepted a post as director and manager of a whaling company based in the Seychelles, and spent four months there, but the venture failed. On his return to Britain he finally secured a minor post at the Admiralty.

Bruce continued to lobby for recognition, highlighting the distinctions between the treatment of SNAE and that of English expeditions. When the war finished he attempted to revive his various interests, but his health was failing, forcing him to close his laboratory. On the 1920 voyage to Spitsbergen he travelled in an advisory role, unable to participate in the detailed work. On return, he was confined in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and later in the Liberton Hospital, Edinburgh, where he died on 28 October 1921. In accordance with his wishes he was cremated, and the ashes taken to South Georgia to be scattered on the southern sea. Despite his irregular income and general lack of funds, his estate realised £7,000 (2025 value about £).

== Assessment ==
After Bruce&#x27;s death his long-time friend and colleague Robert Rudmose Brown wrote, in a letter to Bruce&#x27;s father: &quot;His name is imperishably enrolled among the world&#x27;s great explorers, and the martyrs to unselfish scientific devotion.&quot; Rudmose Brown&#x27;s biography was published in 1923, and in the same year a joint committee of Edinburgh&#x27;s learned societies instituted the Bruce Memorial Prize, an award for young polar scientists. Thereafter his name continued to be respected in scientific circles, but Bruce and his achievements were forgotten by the general public. Occasional mentions of him, in polar histories and biographies of major figures such as Scott and Shackleton, tended to be dismissive and inaccurate.

The early years of the 21st century have seen a reassessment of Bruce&#x27;s work. Contributory factors have been the SNAE centenary, and Scotland&#x27;s renewed sense of national identity. A 2003 expedition, in a modern research ship &quot;Scotia&quot;, used information collected by Bruce as a basis for examining climate change in South Georgia. This expedition predicted &quot;dramatic conclusions&quot; relating to global warming from its research, and saw this contribution as a &quot;fitting tribute to Britain&#x27;s forgotten polar hero, William Speirs Bruce&quot;.

An hour-long BBC television documentary on Bruce presented by Neil Oliver in 2011 contrasted his meticulous science with his rivals&#x27; aim of enhancing imperial prestige. A new biographer, Peter Speak (2003), claims that the SNAE was &quot;by far the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientific expedition of the Heroic Age&quot;.

The same author considers reasons why Bruce&#x27;s efforts to capitalise on this success met with failure, and suggests a combination of his shy, solitary, uncharismatic nature and his &quot;fervent&quot; Scottish nationalism. Bruce seemingly lacked public relations skills and the ability to promote his work, after the fashion of Scott and Shackleton; a lifelong friend described him as being &quot;as prickly as the Scottish thistle itself&quot;. On occasion he behaved tactlessly, as with Jackson over the question of the specimens brought back from Franz Josef Land, and on another occasion with the Royal Geographical Society, over the question of a minor expense claim.

As to his nationalism, he wished to see Scotland on an equal footing with other nations. His national pride was intense; in a Preparatory Note to &quot;The Voyage of the Scotia&quot; he wrote: &quot;While &#x27;Science&#x27; was the talisman of the Expedition, &#x27;Scotland&#x27; was emblazoned on its flag&quot;. This insistence on emphasising the Scottish character of his enterprises could be irksome to those who did not share his passion. He retained the respect and devotion of those whom he led, and of those who had known him longest. John Arthur Thomson, who had known Bruce since Granton, wrote of him when reviewing Rudmose Brown&#x27;s 1923 biography: &quot;We never heard him once grumble about himself, though he was neither to hold or bend when he thought some injustice was being done to, or slight cast on, his men, on his colleagues, on his laboratory, on his Scotland. Then one got glimpses of the volcano which his gentle spirit usually kept sleeping.&quot;

<doc id="816346" wikidata="Q9460131" url="?curid=816346" title="Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout">
<text>In automotive design, a front-engine, front-wheel-drive (FWD) layout, or FF layout, places both the internal combustion engine and driven roadwheels at the front of the vehicle.

==Usage implications==
Historically, this designation was used regardless of whether the entire engine was behind the front axle line. In recent times, the manufacturers of some cars have added to the designation with the term &quot;front-mid&quot; which describes a car in which the engine is in front of the passenger compartment but behind the front axle. The engine positions of most pre–World-War-II cars are &quot;front-mid&quot; or on the front axle.

This layout is the most traditional form and remains a popular, practical design. The engine, which takes up a great deal of space, is packaged in a location passengers and luggage typically would not use. The main deficit is weight distribution—the heaviest component is at one end of the vehicle. Car handling is not ideal, but usually predictable.

In contrast with the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RWD), the FWD layout eliminates the need for a central tunnel or a higher chassis clearance to accommodate a driveshaft providing power to the rear wheels. Like the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RR) and rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RMR) layouts, it places the engine over the drive wheels, improving traction in many applications. As the steered wheels are also the driven wheels, FWD cars are generally considered superior to RWD cars in conditions in which there is low traction such as snow, mud, gravel or wet tarmac. When hill climbing in low-traction conditions RR is considered the best two-wheel-drive layout, primarily due to the shift of weight to the rear wheels when climbing. The cornering ability of an FWD vehicle is generally better, because the engine is placed over the steered wheels. However, as the driven wheels have the additional demands of steering, if a vehicle accelerates quickly, less grip is available for cornering, which can result in understeer. High-performance vehicles rarely use the FWD layout because weight is transferred to the rear wheels under acceleration, while unloading the front wheels and sharply reducing their grip, effectively capping the amount of power which could realistically be utilized; in addition, the high power of high-performance cars can result in torque steer. Electronic traction control can avoid wheel-spin but largely negates the benefit of extra power. This was a reason for the adoption of the all-wheel-drive quattro system in the high performance Jensen FF and Audi Quattro road cars.

==Historical arrangements==
Early cars using the FWD layout include the 1925 Alvis, 1929 Cord L-29, 1931 DKW F1, the 1948 Citroën 2CV, 1949 Saab 92, the 1957 Trabant P50, and the 1959 Mini. In the 1980s, the traction and packaging advantages of this layout caused many compact and mid-sized vehicle makers to adopt it in the US. Most European and Japanese manufacturers switched to front wheel drive for the majority of their cars in the 1960s and 1970s, the last to change being VW, Ford of Europe, and General Motors (Vauxhall - UK and Opel - Germany). Toyota was the last Japanese company to switch in the early 1980s. BMW, focused on luxury vehicles, however retained the rear-wheel-drive layout in even their smaller cars, though their MINI marque are FWD.

There are four different arrangements for this basic layout, depending on the location of the engine, which is the heaviest component of the drivetrain.

===Mid-engine / Front-wheel drive===
The earliest front wheel drive cars were mid-engine, front-wheel-drive layout (MF). The engine was mounted longitudinally (fore-and-aft, or north–south) behind the wheels, with the transmission ahead of the engine and differential at the very front of the car. With the engine so far back, the weight distribution of such cars as the Cord L-29 was not ideal; the driven wheels did not carry a large enough proportion of weight for good traction and handling. The 1934 Citroën Traction Avant solved the weight distribution issue by placing the transmission at the front of the car with the differential between it and the engine. Combined with the car&#x27;s low slung unibody design, this resulted in handling which was remarkable for the era. Renault is the most recent user of this format - having used it on the Renault 4, and the first generation Renault 5, but it has since fallen out of favor since it encroaches into the interior space.

=== Longitudinally mounted front-engine and front-wheel drive===
The 1946 Panhard Dyna X, designed by Jean-Albert Grégoire, had the engine longitudinally in front of the front wheels, with the transmission behind the engine and the differential at the rear of the assembly. This arrangement, used by Panhard until 1967, potentially had a weight distribution problem analogous to that of the Cord L29 mentioned above. However, the Panhard&#x27;s air-cooled flat twin engine was very light, and mounted low down with a low centre of gravity reducing the effect. The air-cooled flat twin engine of the Citroën 2CV was also mounted very low, in front of the front wheels, with the transmission behind the axle line and the differential between the two. This became quite popular; cars using this layout included the German Ford Taunus 12M and the Lancia Flavia and Fulvia. This is the standard configuration of Audi and Subaru front-wheel-drive vehicles. In 1979, Toyota introduced and launched their first front-wheel-drive car, the Tercel, and it had its engine longitudinally mounted, unlike most other front-wheel-drive cars on the market at that time. This arrangement continued also on the second-generation Tercel, until 1987, the third generation received a new, transversely mounted engine. Other front-wheel-drive Toyota models, such as Camry, and Corolla, had transversely mounted engines from the beginning on.

The 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado (along with its sister model the Cadillac Eldorado) used a novel arrangement which had the engine and transmission in a &#x27;side-by-side&#x27; arrangement with power being transmitted between the two via a heavy-duty chain, and a specially designed intermediate driveshaft that passed under the engine sump. This family has the distinction of being the highest engine capacity (8.2 L) front-wheel-drive vehicles ever built. The Saab 99 and “classic” Saab 900 also used a similar arrangement. The Eagle Premier used a similar powertrain arrangement found in the Renault 21 and 25 – later becoming the basis for the Chrysler LH sedans produced until the 2004 model year.

Today, Audi is the most prominent user of this mechanical layout, having used it since the 1950s in its predecessor companies DKW and Auto Union, and it can be found in its larger models from the A4 upward. The latest evolution of the format in Audi&#x27;s MLB platform attempts to address the long-standing drawback of uneven weight distribution. This is done by packaging the differential in front of the clutch, allowing the axle line to be further forward in relation to the rear face of the engine block.

=== Front-engine transversely mounted / Front-wheel drive===
The first popular transverse engined FWD cars were the DKW &#x27;Front&#x27; made from 1931, which had a twin cylinder two-stroke engine. 
Saab copied this design on their first car, the 1949 Saab 92. The Trabant in 1957 was also one of the only cars to have a transverse mounted engine, being a sort of DKW successor. This was a novelty, especially for a car being made in a communist country.

Issigonis&#x27;s Mini of 1959 and related cars such as the Maxi, Austin 1100/1300 and Allegro had the four-cylinder inline water-cooled engine transversely mounted. The transmission was located in the sump below the crankshaft, with power transmitted by transfer gears. Other models that used the &quot;transmission-in-sump&quot; layout included the Datsun 100A (Cherry) and various applications of the PSA-Renault X-Type engine such as the Peugeot 104 and Renault 14. The 1955 Suzuki Suzulight also introduced a front engine with a transversely installed two-stroke twin-cylinder engine (using DKW technology) in a city car/&quot;kei&quot; car application, based on the German Lloyd LP400.

Dante Giacosa&#x27;s Autobianchi Primula of 1964, Fiat 128 and Fiat 127, put the transmission on one side of the transversely mounted engine, and doubled back the drivetrain to put the differential just behind the transmission, but offset to one side. Hence the driveshafts to the wheels are longer on one side than the other. This located the weight just a bit in front of the wheels. It is this system which dominates worldwide at present.

Front-wheel-drive vehicles tend to suffer from &quot;torque steer&quot; under heavy acceleration. This is caused by differing drive shaft lengths which in turn results in different incident angles at the joints of the driveshaft. The farther these joints are articulate, the less effective they are at delivering torque to the wheels.

====Front-wheel drive design characteristics====
====Front-wheel drive shafts====

In front wheel drive vehicles, the drive shafts transfer the drive directly from the differential to the front wheels. A short inner stub shaft is splined to the differential side gear and an outer stub shaft is splined to the front wheel hub. Each stub shaft has a yoke, or housing, to accommodate a universal joint, at each end of a connecting intermediate shaft.

Universal joints let the shaft keep rotating while allowing for changes due to suspension movement, such as shaft length and horizontal angle, and shaft angle as the steering turns. Constant-velocity universal joints are normally used to transfer power smoothly between the components. The inner universal can be a plunge or tripod type joint. The tripod is splined to the intermediate shaft and held by a circlip. A ball, supported on needle roller bearings, is fitted to each post of the tripod, and these slide in a trunion inside the yoke. This caters for changes in shaft length and horizontal angle. The drive is transferred through the trunion and balls to rotate the shaft.

The outer universal joint allows greater angular changes but not changes in shaft length. It is normally a ball and cage type with an inner race splined to the intermediate shaft. An outer race is formed in the yoke. The cage retains the balls in location in grooves in both races.
The balls transfer the drive from the shaft to the hub and allow for changes in horizontal angle and for a wide steering angle to be achieved. A flexible rubber boot fitted to each joint retains grease and keeps out dirt and moisture.

Where the differential is not located in the center line of the vehicle, an intermediate shaft can be fitted to maintain equal length drive shafts on each side. This keeps drive shaft angles equal on both sides and helps prevent steering irregularities and vibration.
The outer end of the intermediate shaft is supported by a bearing secured to the transaxle case and a universal joint assists with alignment.
In some cases a longer drive shaft is used on one side. A rubber dynamic damper may be fitted to absorb vibrations.

<doc id="816355" wikidata="Q18711283" url="?curid=816355" title="Rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout">
<text>In automotive design, an RR, or [[Rear-engine design|rear-engine]], [[rear-wheel-drive]] layout places both the engine and drive wheels at the rear of the vehicle. In contrast to the RMR layout, the center of mass of the engine is between the rear axle and the rear bumper. Although very common in transit buses and coaches due to the elimination of the drive shaft with low-floor buses, this layout has become increasingly rare in passenger cars.

==Overview==

Most of the traits of the RR configuration are shared with the mid-engine rear-wheel-drive, or MR. Placing the engine near the driven rear wheels allows for a physically smaller, lighter, less complex, and more efficient drivetrain, since there is no need for a driveshaft, and the differential can be integrated with the transmission, commonly referred to as a transaxle. The front-engine front-wheel-drive layout also has this advantage.

Since the engine is typically the heaviest component of the car, putting it near the rear axle usually results in more weight over the rear axle than the front, commonly referred to as a rear weight bias. The farther back the engine, the greater the bias. Typical weight bias for an FF (front engine, front-wheel-drive) is 65/35 front/rear; for FR, 55/45; for MR, 45/55; for RR, 35/65. A static rear weight requires less forward brake bias, as load is more evenly distributed among all four wheels under braking. Similarly, a rear weight bias means that the driven wheels have increased traction when accelerating, allowing them to put more power on the ground and accelerate faster.

The disadvantage to a rear weight bias is that the car can become unstable and tend to oversteer, especially when decelerating (whether braking or lifting off the throttle; see lift-off oversteer). When this happens, rotational inertia dictates that the added weight away from the axis of rotation (generally the steering wheels) will be more likely to maintain the spin, especially under braking. This is an inherent instability in the design, making it easier to induce and more difficult to recover from a slide than in a less rear-weight-biased vehicle.

Under hard acceleration, the decreased weight over the front wheels means less traction, sometimes producing a tendency for rear-engined cars to understeer out of a corner.

In these respects, an RR can be considered to be an exaggeration of MR - harder braking, faster and earlier acceleration, and increased oversteer.

In off-road and low-traction situations, the RR layout has some advantages compared to other 2WD layouts. The weight is biased towards the driven wheels- as with FF vehicles. This both improves drive-wheel traction and reduces the tendency for the undriven wheels to dig in. In addition, the driving and steering requirements are split between front and rear- as with FR vehicles- making it less likely for either to lose traction. Many dune buggies successfully use a Volkswagen beetle as the donor car for this reason. The relative simplicity and light weight compared to 4WD can therefore sometimes outweigh the disadvantage of only having two driven wheels.

Where RR differs from MR is in that the engine is located outside the wheelbase. The major advantage of MR - low moment of inertia - is negated somewhat (though still lower than FR), and there is more room for passengers and cargo (though usually less than FR). Furthermore, because both axles are on the same side of the engine, it is technically more straightforward to drive all four wheels, than in a mid-engined configuration (though there have been more high-performance cars with the M4 layout than with R4). Finally, a rear-mounted engine has empty air (often at a lower pressure) behind it when moving, allowing more efficient cooling for air-cooled vehicles (more of which have been RR than liquid-cooled, such as the Volkswagen Beetle, and one of the few production air-cooled turbocharged cars, the Porsche 930).

For liquid-cooled vehicles, however, this layout presents a disadvantage, since it requires either increased coolant piping from a front-mounted radiator (meaning more weight and complexity), or relocating the radiator(s) to the sides or rear, and adding air ducting to compensate for the lower airflow at the rear of the car.

Due to the handling difficulty, the need for more space efficiency, and the near ubiquitous use of liquid-cooled engines in modern cars, most manufacturers have abandoned the RR layout. The major exception is Porsche, who has developed the 911 for over 40 years and has taken advantage of the benefits of RR while mitigating its drawbacks to acceptable levels, lately with the help of electronic aids.
==History==
One of first RR cars was Tatra 77 of 1934, the first serial-produced aerodynamic car, designed by Hans Ledwinka. Tatra used this layout until end of production of T700 in 1999. In case of T613 and T700 Tatra used layout with engine above rear axle, which reduced some disadvantages of RR layout. Mercedes-Benz also produced several models of RR cars in this period, starting with the 130H (1934). The radical 1930s Tatra format (air-cooled, rear engine and streamlined, teardrop design) was an influence on Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s &#x27;People&#x27;s Car&#x27; (Volkswagen) for Adolf Hitler. As well as being the most produced car ever, it set a trend for RR small cars that lasted well into the 1960s. The final form of the RR Volkswagen was the Type 3 of 1961, which flattened the engine (or &#x27;pancake&#x27;), allowing for luggage spaces front and rear.

Porsche has continued to develop its 911 model as a rear-engined vehicle, although they have introduced multiple all-wheel-drive models. Most notably, the 911 Turbo has been sold as AWD-only since the release of the 993 model. Race-oriented models such as the GT3 and twin-turbocharged GT2 remain solely RR, however.

Another manufacturer to implement the RR configuration was the DeLorean Motor Company with its DeLorean sports car. To compensate for the uneven (35/65) weight distribution caused by the rear-mounted engine, DeLorean used rear wheels with a diameter slightly greater than the front wheels. Before that was the rear-engined Škoda&#x27;s from Škoda 1000MB (produced from 1964) to Škoda 130/135/136 (produced until 1990) or the Polski Fiat 126p (produced until October 2000).

A range of sports road cars and racing cars with the RR layout was produced by the French company Alpine. These had bodies made of composite materials and used mechanical components made by Renault. (Alpine was eventually acquired by Renault; the A610 was a Renault product that used the Alpine name.)

Early cars using the RR layout included the Tucker, Volkswagen Beetle, Porsche 356, Chevrolet Corvair, NSU Prinz, ZAZ Zaporozhets and Hino Contessa.

==Present day==
Many modern electric cars use an RR layout for base variants with a single motor due to the low weight and cooling requirements of the electric motor. The Tesla Cybertruck and GMC Hummer EV also use this layout for their base variants.

Most modern heavy duty buses use an extreme RR layout. In transit buses this can be used to make a very low floor level in the first two-thirds of the bus, thus making disabled access much easier.

Most tour buses and coaches also employ a similar design, however the free space is usually used for luggage, and sometimes air conditioning equipment.

<text>Phil Ineson is a chair in Global Change Ecology at the University of York. Ineson is particularly noted for his work with stable isotopes (and was the first to grow C3 plants on C4 soil).

Ineson received his BSc from Manchester Polytechnic in 1982, receiving a Ph.D. from the University of Liverpool in 1986. He was then a NERC Post-Doctoral Research Assistant at the University of Exeter until 1989. NERC Research Fellow at ITE Merlewood and later Senior Scientific Officer (SSO). Between 1996 and 1999 he was at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, (CEH) Merlewood. Between 1998 and 2000 he was visiting professor at Lancaster University. He was made chair in Global Change Ecology at York in 2000.

Ineson &quot;et al.&quot; (1996) were able to track the movement of carbon through a plant by using the stable isotopes of carbon, namely 12C and 13C. To obtain soil with a different isotope ratio to normal, they obtained soil from North America on which C4 plants had been grown, giving it a different signature to soil on which C3 plants had been grown. Comparisons of the signatures allowed the turnover of carbon to be measured. This is now a commonly used technique (see e.g. Pataki &quot;et al.&quot; (2003)) particularly useful in light of elevated carbon dioxide levels due to atmospheric pollution.

<text>The University of the Nations (U of N) is an unaccredited Christian university. The University of the Nations operates under the umbrella organization of the Youth With A Mission (YWAM) network.

==History==
The institution was founded in 1978 as Pacific &amp; Asia Christian University (PACU) by Howard Malmstadt and Loren Cunningham, the founder of Youth with a Mission, in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. As other locations were established around the world, PACU was renamed the University of the Nations in 1989.

==Accreditation==
University of the Nations is not accredited by any recognized accreditation body. As such, its degrees and credits may not be acceptable to employers or other institutions, and use of degrees from schools without accreditation from a nationally recognized accrediting agency may be illegal in some states unless the school is approved by the state licensing agency.

University of the Nations asserts that other institutions have accepted and continue to accept transfer credits, including Houghton College, and the South African Theological Seminary.

Australia&#x27;s higher education and training system lists University of the Nations&#x27; affiliated Institute for the Nations and Youth With A Mission programs in five locations as registered training organisations authorized to provide certificates and diplomas in several specified fields.


==Notable people==

==Controversies==
In January 2018, Pablo Rivera, the chief financial officer for University of the Nations in Kona, pled guilty to wire fraud. Rivera embezzled nearly 3.1 million dollars, amounting to $50,000 per month. Before the fraud was exposed, the school&#x27;s financial situation was critical, increased charges were applied to volunteers and students.

In October 2020, University of the Nations in Kona was associated with the largest single day increase of COVID-19 outbreak on the Island of Hawaiʻi up to that date.

<doc id="816362" wikidata="Q6143155" url="?curid=816362" title="Lyall Watson">
<text>Lyall Watson (12 April 1939 – 25 June 2008) was a South African botanist, zoologist, biologist, anthropologist, ethologist, and author of many books, among the most popular of which is the best seller &quot;Supernature&quot;. Lyall Watson tried to make sense of natural and supernatural phenomena in biological terms. He is credited with coining the &quot;hundredth monkey&quot; effect in his 1979 book, &quot;Lifetide&quot;; later, in &quot;The Whole Earth Review&quot;, he conceded this was &quot;a metaphor of my own making&quot;.

==Life==
Malcolm Lyall-Watson was born in Johannesburg. He had an early fascination for nature in the surrounding bush, learning from Zulu and !Kung bushmen. Watson attended boarding school at Rondebosch Boys&#x27; High School in Cape Town, completing his studies in 1955. He enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1956, at the age of 15 where, by the time he was 19, he had earned degrees in both botany and zoology, before securing an apprenticeship in palaeontology under Raymond Dart, leading on to anthropological studies in Germany and the Netherlands. Later he earned degrees in geology, chemistry, marine biology, ecology, and anthropology. He completed a doctorate in ethology at the University of London, under Desmond Morris. He also worked at the BBC writing and producing nature documentaries.

Around this time he shortened his name to Lyall Watson. He served as director of the Johannesburg Zoo from the age of 23, an expedition leader to various locales, and Seychelles commissioner for the International Whaling Commission.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Watson presented Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of sumo tournaments.

Watson married Vivienne Mawson in 1961, and they divorced in 1966. His second wife was Jacquey Visick, and his third wife, Alice Coogan, died in 2003. He was the eldest of three brothers, one of whom (Andrew) lived in Gympie, Queensland, Australia. It was while visiting Andrew that he died of a stroke on 25 June 2008. He lived in Cork, Ireland.

== Writing career ==
Watson began writing his first book, &quot;Omnivore&quot;, during the early 1960s while under the supervision of Desmond Morris, and wrote more than 21 others.

<text>Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano is a Catholic parish in the Diocese of Orange. The parish church is located just northwest of Mission San Juan Capistrano in the city of San Juan Capistrano, California, United States. Completed in 1986, it was designated a minor basilica in 2000 and a national shrine in 2003.

The parish sponsors a number of ministries, notably &quot;Serra&#x27;s Pantry&quot;, a registered food agency distributing food and hygiene supplies to several hundred local families, and the Mission Basilica School, a parochial school for children in grades pre-K through 8.

==History==

St. John O&#x27;Sullivan was placed in charge of the mission in 1910, at which time its community was scattered and its buildings in ruins. He set about rebuilding the parish community as well as restoring the old facilities. The Mission was accorded full parochial status in 1918 as the Mission Church San Juan Capistrano. The Serra Chapel, the oldest standing church building in California and the only extant building where St. Junipero Serra is known to have said Mass, was used for services, as the Mission&#x27;s original stone church was destroyed in an 1812 earthquake.

Various efforts had been made to restore the church over the years, but had only caused further damage. O&#x27;Sullivan, who would serve as pastor until his death in 1933, had thought to construct a new parish church modeled on the old stone church, but never realized his idea. The modern case for a new parish church was taken up by Fr. Paul Martin, who was named pastor in 1976. By this time, the area Catholic population had grown considerably, and the Serra Chapel was inadequate to the needs of the parish.

Fundraising had begun by 1981, encompassing pledge drives and donations from mission visitors. The first Mass in the new building was offered on Christmas 1984, but construction would not be completed for another two years. The first Mass in the new church was celebrated on October 23, 1986, and the building was officially dedicated by Timothy Cardinal Manning on February 8, 1987.

==Design==
The church is patterned after the Mission&#x27;s 1806 stone church, but is not a replica of it. It was designed by architect John Bartlett and built by Joseph Byron, Jr. of Alex Sutherland Construction. The interior was designed by historian Norman Neuerberg, who painted much of the decorative and sacred art which adorns the walls.

A prominent feature of the basilica is the Grand retablo, a , , 16-ton altar-backing carved in cedar and covered in gold leaf which is stylistically reminiscent of 17th- and 18th-century Spanish colonial and Mexican colonial retablos. The retablo&#x27;s focal point is the Trinity, composed of the crucifix, God the Father depicted as an ancient patriarch, and the Holy Spirit depicted as a dove. Beneath the Trinity is Our Lady of Guadalupe. Four saints included on the retablo are Saint Francis of Assisi — patron of the mission&#x27;s founding order, Saint Joseph, Saint Junípero Serra — the Mission&#x27;s founder, and Saint Kateri Tekakwitha — significant for the area&#x27;s Native American population. The Retablo was designed and created by 84 artisans in numerous parts at the Talleres de Arte Granda in Madrid, Spain.

<doc id="816369" wikidata="Q1093045" url="?curid=816369" title="Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout">
<text>In automotive design, an RMR, or rear [[Mid-engine design|mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel-drive]] layout is one in which the rear wheels are driven by an engine placed with its center of gravity in front of the rear axle, and thus right behind the passenger compartment. Nowadays more frequently called &#x27;RMR&#x27;, to acknowledge that certain sporty or performance focused front-engined cars are also &quot;mid-engined&quot;, by having the main engine mass behind the front axle, RMR layout cars were previously (until ca. the 1990) just called MR, or mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout), because the nuance between distinctly front-engined vs. front &quot;mid-engined&quot; cars often remained undiscussed.

In contrast to the fully rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, the center of mass of the engine is in front of the rear axle. This layout is typically chosen for its favorable weight distribution. Placing the car&#x27;s heaviest component within the wheelbase minimizes its rotational inertia around the vertical axis, facilitating turn-in or yaw angle. Also, a near 50/50% weight distribution, with a slight rear weight bias, gives a very favorable balance, with plenty of weight on the driven rear axle under acceleration, while distributing the weight fairly evenly under braking, thereby making optimal use of all four wheels to decelerate the car rapidly as well.

The RMR layout generally has a lower tendency to understeer. However, since there is less weight over the front wheels, under acceleration the front of the car can be prone to lift and still have understeer. Most rear-engine layouts have historically been used in smaller vehicles, because the weight of the engine at the rear has an adverse effect on a larger car&#x27;s handling, making it &#x27;tail-heavy&#x27;, although this effect is more pronounced with engines mounted behind the rear axle. It is felt that the low polar inertia is crucial in selection of this layout. The mid-engined layout also uses up central space, making it generally only practical for single seating-row sports-cars, with exception to a handful of 2+2 designs. Additionally, some microtrucks use this layout, with a small, low engine beneath a flat load floor above the rear wheel-wells. This makes it possible to move the cab right to the front of the vehicle, thus increasing the loading area at the expense of slightly reduced load depth.

In modern racing cars, RMR is a common configuration and is usually synonymous with &quot;mid-engine&quot;. Due to its weight distribution and the favorable vehicle dynamics it produces, this layout is heavily employed in open-wheel Formula racing cars (such as Formula One and IndyCar) as well as most purpose-built sports racing cars. This configuration was also common in smaller-engined 1950s microcars, in which the engines did not take up much space. Because of successes in motorsport, the RMR platform has been commonly used in many road-going sports cars despite the inherent challenges of design, maintenance and lack of cargo space. The similar mid-engine, four-wheel-drive layout gives many of the same advantages and is used when extra traction is desired, such as in some supercars and in the Group B rally cars.

==History==
The 1900 NW Rennzweier was one of the first race cars with mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Other known historical examples include the 1923 Benz Tropfenwagen. It was based on an earlier design named the Rumpler Tropfenwagen in 1921 made by Edmund von Rumpler, an Austrian engineer working at Daimler. The Benz Tropfenwagen was designed by Ferdinand Porsche along with Willy Walb and Hans Nibel. It raced in 1923 and 1924 and was most successful in the Italian Grand Prix in Monza where it stood fourth. Later, Ferdinand Porsche used mid-engine design concept towards the Auto Union Grand Prix cars of the 1930s which became the first winning RMR racers. They were decades before their time, although MR Miller Specials raced a few times at Indianapolis between 1939 and 1947. In 1953 Porsche premiered the tiny and altogether new RMR 550 Spyder and in a year it was notoriously winning in the smaller sports and endurance race car classes against much larger cars a sign of greater things to come. The 718 followed similarly in 1958. But it was not until the late 1950s that RMR reappeared in Grand Prix (today&#x27;s &quot;Formula One&quot;) races in the form of the Cooper-Climax (1957), soon followed by cars from BRM and Lotus. Ferrari and Porsche soon made Grand Prix RMR attempts with less initial success. The mid-engined layout was brought back to Indianapolis in 1961 by the Cooper Car Company with Jack Brabham running as high as third and finishing ninth. Cooper did not return, but from 1963 on British built mid-engined cars from constructors like Brabham, Lotus and Lola competed regularly and in 1965 Lotus won Indy with their Type 38.

Rear mid-engines were widely used in microcars like the Isetta or the Zündapp Janus.

The first rear mid-engined road car after WW II was the 1962 (Rene) Bonnet / Matra Djet, which used the 1108cc Renault Sierra engine, mated to the transaxle from the FWD Renault Estafette van. Nearly 1700 were built until 1967. This was followed by the first De Tomaso, the Vallelunga, which mated a tuned Ford Cortina 1500 Kent engine to a VW transaxle with Hewland gearsets. Introduced at Turin in 1963, 58 were built 1964–68. A similar car was the Renault-engined Lotus Europa, built from 1966 to 1975.

Finally, in 1966, the Lamborghini Miura was the first high performance mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive road car.
The concept behind the Miura was that of putting on the road a grand tourer featuring state-of-the-art racing-car technology of the time; hence the Miura was powered by a V12 transversely mounted between the rear wheels, solidal to the gearbox and differential. This represented an extremely innovative sportscar at a time when all of its competitors (aside from the rear-engined Porsches), from Ferraris to Aston Martins, were traditional front-engined, rear-wheel-drive grand tourers.

The Pontiac Fiero was a mid-engined sports car that was built by the Pontiac division of General Motors from 1984 to 1988. The Fiero was the first two-seater Pontiac since the 1926 to 1938 coupes, and also the first mass-produced mid-engine sports car by a U.S. manufacturer.

<text>Jonathan Dermot Spence (11 August 1936 – 25 December 2021) was a British-American historian, sinologist, and author specialised in Chinese history. He was Sterling Professor of History at Yale University from 1993 to 2008. His most widely read book is &quot;The Search for Modern China&quot;, a survey of the last several hundred years of Chinese history based on his popular course at Yale. A prolific author, reviewer, and essayist, he published over a dozen books on China. Spence&#x27;s major interest was modern China, especially the Qing dynasty, and relations between China and the West. Spence frequently used biographies to examine cultural and political history. Another common theme is the efforts of both Westerners and Chinese &quot;to change China&quot;, and how such efforts were frustrated.

== Early life and education ==
Spence was born on 11 August 1936 to Muriel ( Crailsham) and Dermot Spence in Surrey in England. His mother was a French researcher while his father worked at an art gallery and a publishing house.

Spence was educated at Winchester College until 1954. He then spent two years in the British Army and was deployed to Germany. He read history at Clare College, Cambridge and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1959. While at Cambridge he was the editor of the campus magazine and was also the co-editor of British literary magazine Granta. He went to Yale University on a Clare-Mellon Fellowship to study the history and culture of China, receiving an MA and then a PhD in 1965, when he won the John Addison Porter Prize. As part of his graduate training, he spent a year in Australia to study under Fang Chao-ying and Tu Lien-che, scholars of the Qing dynasty.

==Academic career==
Spence taught a popular undergraduate course at Yale University on the history of modern China, which formed the basis for his book &quot;The Search for Modern China&quot; (1990). He taught at Yale for more than 40 years. During this time he wrote many books on China that furthered the understanding of the country and its culture with Western audiences. Some of his books during this period included &quot;The Search for Modern China&quot; (1990), which was published on the back of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, and &quot;God&#x27;s Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan&quot; (1996).

Spence was president of the American Historical Association between 2004 and 2005. While his primary focus was on Qing dynasty China, he also wrote a biography of Mao Zedong and &quot;The Gate of Heavenly Peace&quot;, a study of twentieth-century intellectuals and their relation to revolution. He retired from Yale in 2008.

His book &quot;The Search for Modern China&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller and documented the evolution of China starting from the decline of the Ming dynasty in the early 1600s to the pro-democracy movement of 1989, while his book &quot;Treason by the Book&quot; (2001) documented the story of a scholar who took on the third Manchu Emperor in the 1700s. 

===Honors===
Spence received eight honorary degrees in the United States as well as from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and (in 2003) from Oxford University. He was invited to become a visiting professor at Peking University and an honorary professor at Nanjing University. He was named Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 2001, and in 2006, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge.

He received the William C. DeVane Medal of the Yale Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa (1952); a Guggenheim Fellowship (1979); the Los Angeles Times History Prize (1982), and the Vursel Prize of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1983). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1985), named a MacArthur Fellow (1988), appointed to the Council of Scholars of the Library of Congress (1988), elected a member of the American Philosophical Society (1993), and named a corresponding fellow of the British Academy (1997).

In May and June 2008, he gave the 60th anniversary Reith Lectures, which were broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

In 2010, Spence was appointed to deliver the annual Jefferson Lecture at the Library of Congress, the US federal government&#x27;s highest honour for achievement in the humanities.

==Personal life==
Spence&#x27;s name in Chinese, (pinyin: &quot;Shǐ Jǐngqiān&quot;), was given to him by Fang Chao-ying to reflect his love of history and admiration for the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian. He chose the surname 史 (&quot;Shǐ&quot;; literally &quot;history&quot;) and personal name (&quot;Jǐngqiān&quot;), where (&quot;jǐng&quot;) means admire (as in ) and (&quot;qiān&quot;) was taken from the personal name of Sima Qian (). Spence became a U.S. citizen in 2000.

Spence&#x27;s wife Annping Chin was a senior lecturer in history at Yale with a PhD in Chinese thought from Columbia. He had two sons from a previous marriage (1962–1993) to Helen Alexander, Colin and Ian Spence, two stepchildren, Yar Woo and Mei Chin, a grandchild as well as two step-grandchildren. Spence died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on 25 December 2021, at the age of 85 at his residence in West Haven, Connecticut.

<text>The Danevirke or Danework (modern Danish spelling: &quot;Dannevirke&quot;; in Old Norse: &quot;Danavirki&quot;, in German: &quot;Danewerk&quot;, literally meaning &quot;earthwork of the Danes&quot;) is a system of Danish fortifications in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. This historically important linear defensive earthwork across the neck of the Cimbrian peninsula was initiated by the Danes in the Nordic Iron Age about AD 650. It was later expanded multiple times during Denmark&#x27;s Viking Age and High Middle Ages. The Danevirke was last used for military purposes in 1864 during the Second War of Schleswig.

The Danevirke consists of several walls, trenches and the Schlei Barrier. The walls stretch for 30 km, from the former Viking trade centre of Hedeby near Schleswig on the Baltic Sea coast in the east to the extensive marshlands in the west of the peninsula. One of the walls (named &quot;Østervolden&quot;), between the Schlei and Eckernförde inlets, defended the Schwansen peninsula.

According to written sources, work on the Danevirke was started by the Danish King Gudfred in 808. Fearing an invasion by the Franks, who had conquered heathen Frisia over the previous 100 years and Old Saxony in 772 to 804, Godfred began work on an enormous structure to defend his realm, separating the Jutland peninsula from the northern extent of the Frankish empire. However, the Danes were also in conflict with the Saxons south of Hedeby during the Nordic Iron Age, and recent archaeological excavations have revealed that the Danevirke was initiated much earlier than King Gudfred&#x27;s reign, at least as far back as 500 AD and probably well before that. Because of its historical importance and testimony to the defense of trade routes in the Viking Age, the Danevirke and the nearby Viking town of Hedeby were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2018.

==Symbolism==

Legend has it that Queen Thyra ordered the Danevirke to be built. She was the wife of the first historically recognized king of Denmark, Gorm the Old (reign c. 936 – c. 958).

With the emergence of national states in Europe during the 19th Century, the Danevirke became a powerful symbol for Denmark and for the idea of a unique Danish people and Danish culture. Throughout the nineteenth century, Denmark and Germany struggled politically and militarily for possession of the territory variously known as &quot;Sønderjylland&quot; or &quot;Slesvig&quot; by the Danes and &quot;Schleswig&quot; by the Germans. Two wars were fought, the First Schleswig War (1848–1851) and the Second Schleswig War (1864), eventually resulting in a Danish defeat and subsequent German annexation. In this hostile context, the Danevirke played an important role, at first as a mental cultural barrier against Germany, but soon also as a concrete military fortification, when it was strengthened with cannon emplacements and entrenchments in 1850 and again in 1861.

In the early 19th Century &quot;Dannevirke&quot; was adopted as the title of several Danish nationalist journals dealing specifically with the question of Danish autonomy vis-à-vis Germany, the most notable of these being published by N. F. S. Grundtvig in 1816–19. In earlier times, the Danevirke had indeed defined a cultural and linguistic border between Danish and German fiefdoms, but the cultural and linguistic frontiers had gradually moved north, and by the 19th century territory as far north as Flensburg was predominantly German-speaking, but remained part of Denmark.

==Archaeological record==
Archaeological excavations in 1969–1975 established, with the help of dendrochronology, that the main structure of the Danevirke had been built in three phases between AD 737 and 968. It is, therefore, contemporary with Offa&#x27;s Dyke on the border between Wales and England, another great defensive structure of the late 8th century.

New carbon-14 dating in 2013 has revealed that the second stage started around 500 AD, and the oldest fortifications are even older than that.
Previous carbon-14 dating had dated some of the early constructions to the second half of the 7th century, and dendrochronology also suggests that the examined constructions began not very long after 737, about 70 years before the reign of king Gudfred.

==Size==
The Danevirke is about long overall, with a height varying between . During the Middle Ages, the structure was reinforced with palisades and masonry walls, and was used by Danish kings as a gathering point for Danish military excursions, including a series of crusader raids against the Slavs of the south Baltic. In particular, the 12th-century King Valdemar the Great reinforced parts of the Danevirke with a brick wall, which enabled a continued military use of this strategically important structure. The reinforced parts of the structure are consequently known in Danish as &quot;Valdemarsmuren&quot; (lit: Valdemar&#x27;s wall).

==Stages in the building of the Danevirke==

*Danevirke 1 – Hovedvolden (&quot;the main rampart&quot;), Nordvolden (&quot;the north rampart&quot;), Østervolden (&quot;the east rampart&quot;)&lt;br&gt;The first Danevirke was built in five stages, starting about 650, according to carbon-14 dating. The first three stages were simple ramparts of soil, and the fourth stage was a palisade rampart with heavy timber front, built in 737. In the final stages the timber palisade was reinforced with a heavy stone wall around the timber. Work is said to have been started by Angantyr, and continued by Siegfried, and ended by Guðfrið according to annales in 808.
** Hovedvolden: From Rejde Å (now called Rheider Au) to a small lake called Dannevirke Sø. It was the main segment of the Danevirke. About 2 m high and 12 m wide.
** Nordvolden: From the northeastern side of Dannevirke Sø, and further north about 7 km.
** Østervolden: About 3.3 km long, and protecting Schwansen.
** A 900 m long submerged construction in Slien.
*Danevirke 2 – Kovirke (&quot;cow-work&quot;)/Kograben (&quot;cow-moat&quot; or &quot;district moat&quot;)&lt;br&gt;Built either by Guðfrið or by Harald Bluetooth (if it is the work mentioned as newly made in the Frankish royal annals in 808, then Harald did not build it) it stretched from the Rheide Å about 7 km to a southern extension of the Schlei bay which is now a lake called Selker Noor. Its palisade was about 3 m high, and was a little more solid than that on the first ramparts. The bank of earth behind the palisade was about 2 m high and 7 m wide. It had a V-shaped moat, 4 m wide and 3 m deep.&lt;br&gt;The construction period of this rampart would have been some time between 770 and 970.
*Danevirke 3 – Hovedvolden/Hauptwall/&quot;main rampart&quot;, Krumvolden/Krummwall/&quot;curved rampart&quot;, Buevolden/Bogenwall/&quot;bow rampart&quot;), Dobbeltvolden/Doppelwall/&quot;double rampart&quot;, Forbindelsesvolden (&quot;the connecting rampart&quot;)/Margarethenwall (&quot;Margret&#x27;s rampart&quot;)&lt;br&gt;Hovedvolden was expanded, so that it was now about 5 m high and about 20 m wide. Krumvolden was built through the Rheide Å, and overlapped with Hovedvolden. Forbindelsesvolden closed a gap between Halvkredsvolden (&quot;the semicircle rampart&quot;, a bank that protected Hedeby) and Hovedvolden near Dannevirke Sø. Buevolden and Dobbeltvolden protected an important road junction. This wall is connected to most of the building work is attributed to Harald Bluetooth. Arild Hvitfeldt&#x27;s &quot;Danmarks Riges Krønike&quot; adds a little detail to the extension of the Danevirke in that time period. &quot;Then summoned (Queen) Thyra (wife of Gorm the Old) Danes from all the kingdom&#x27;s regions to meet at the border and under her supervision they built a wall of earth and timber from Slien over the moors to Trene. The Scanians received the western section from Karlegat to Trene. Zealanders and Funen dwellers received the section east from Slien (Schlei bay) to Karlegat. Jutlanders provided provisions to the whole army.&quot; This would place Thyra&#x27;s extension sometime before 940. Forbindelsesvolden was attacked by the Saxons of the Ottonian dynasty in 974.
*Danevirke 4 – Hovedvolden/Hauptwall/&quot;main rampart&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Reinforcement on the Main Wall finished in 954, and a new Forbindelsevold build from 964 to 968. Harald Bluetooth is thought to be the main constructor.
*Danevirke 5 – Forbindelsesvolden, Krumvolden, and Hovedvolden&lt;br&gt;Under Canute IV of Denmark (1080–86) Denmark was at war with the German empire. The Danevirke was strengthened at the beginning of the 12th century: the moats were deepened and the ramparts were made higher. A granite boulder palisade wall was built on a part of Hovedvolden.
*Danevirke 6 – Hovedvolden and Thyraborg&lt;br&gt;Valdemar I fortified the rest of Hovedvolden with the famous &quot;Valdemar-wall&quot;, a 7-m high wall of stones in mortar on a granite boulder base, propped up with buttresses and covered with tiles. This was a large reinforcement, and doubtless deterred many who tried to send an army northwards through Jutland. It was the last true reinforcement of the ramparts. Later Thyraborg castle was built.

The Danevirke began to lose its purpose in the 14th century, owing both to the expense of manning it and to the development of ballistas, trebuchets, and similar siege engines.

==First and Second Schleswig Wars==
===First Schleswig War===
The First Schleswig War commenced on 31 March 1848 but Prussia did not become involved until a naval incident on 19 April. Therefore, on 23 April, General Friedrich von Wrangel marched his 12,000 Prussian troops upon weak Danish resistance at the Danevirke entrenchment and, after a short engagement near the town of Dannewerk, drove the Danish army into retreat and seized the city of Schleswig. An armistice signed on 2 August 1848 caused the Prussians to evacuate Schleswig-Holstein but did not end the war. Further engagements in the next two years saw fighting in the vicinity of the Danevirke but not directly involving it. Final peace was signed on 8 May 1852.

===Second Schleswig War===

The last military use of the Danevirke was during the Second Schleswig War in 1864. Due especially to the above-mentioned emotive nationalist symbolism, public opinion in Denmark and the Danish military had expected the coming battle to take place along the Danevirke. After centuries of abandonment and decay, the Danevirke fortifications were partially restored, strengthened, and equipped with artillery installations in 1850 and 1861. In the Second War of Schleswig, there was some early skirmishing to the south of the Danevirke, but no battle took place at it, as the Danish Commander in Chief, General de Meza, withdrew all soldiers to the trenches at Dybbøl, owing to an unexpected threat of being outflanked, as the Schlei and the wetlands between the Danevirke and Husum had frozen solid in a hard winter and could be crossed easily, and the territory immediately south of the Danevirke had been conquered by the advancing German army. This retreat came as a surprise to the Austro-Prussian army, and almost all of the Danish army succeeded in completing the evacuation. It resulted, however, in the abandonment of important pieces of heavy artillery, and it remains a matter of historical debate why the railway to Flensburg was never properly used for the evacuation. News of the retreat came as a great shock to Danish public opinion which had considered the Danevirke to be impregnable, and General de Meza was promptly relieved of his command. The Danevirke has remained in German possession ever since.

==In World War II==
Following the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II, the Wehrmacht feared that a second Allied invasion might take place through Denmark, and contemplated converting the earthen wall into an anti-tank trench to counter this threat. Had the proposal been implemented, it would have destroyed the structure.

Hearing of the plans, Danish archaeologist Søren Telling – aware that all archaeological investigation was under the ultimate jurisdiction of SS chief Heinrich Himmler – immediately telephoned both the head of the SS&#x27;s archaeological department, &quot;Amt für Ahnenerbe&quot; (&quot;Office for ancestral heritage&quot;), and Himmler himself. Telling argued strongly against the destruction of an important remnant of &quot;Aryan civilization&quot; and Himmler authorized him to stop the construction of the anti-tank trench. He informed Telling that a written order would be dispatched but that it would take several days to arrive. Telling then drove to the site and ordered the commanding Wehrmacht officers to immediately stop the construction process. When the local Wehrmacht commander refused, Telling threatened him with reprisals from the SS. Construction was called off and Himmler&#x27;s written order arrived two days later countering the Wehrmacht&#x27;s original instructions. Telling later settled near the site and considered himself a custodian of it until his death in 1968.

<text>Robert Southwell, SJ (c. 1561 – 21 February 1595), also Saint Robert Southwell, was an English Catholic priest of the Jesuit Order. He was also an author of Christian poetry in Elizabethan English, and a clandestine missionary in Elizabethan England.

After being arrested and imprisoned in 1592, and intermittently tortured and questioned by priest hunter Sir Richard Topcliffe, Southwell was eventually tried and convicted of high treason against Queen Elizabeth I, but in reality for refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy, renounce his belief in the independence of the English Church from control by the State, and similarly repudiate the authority of the Holy See. On 21 February 1595, Southwell was hanged at Tyburn. In 1970, he was canonised by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.

==Early life in England==
He was born at Horsham St Faith, Norfolk, England. Southwell, the youngest of eight children, was brought up in a family of the Norfolk gentry. Despite their Catholic sympathies, the Southwells had profited considerably from King Henry VIII&#x27;s Suppression of the Monasteries. Robert was the third son of Richard Southwell of Horsham St. Faith&#x27;s, Norfolk, by his first wife, Bridget, daughter of Sir Roger Copley of Roughway, Sussex. The hymnodist&#x27;s maternal grandmother was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Shelley; Sir Richard Southwell was his paternal grandfather, but his father was born out of wedlock.

==Enters the Society of Jesus==
In 1576, he was sent to the English college at Douai, boarding there but studying at the Jesuit College of Anchin, a French college associated, like the English College, with the university of Douai. He studied briefly under Leonard Lessius. At the end of the summer, however, his education was interrupted by the movement of French and Spanish forces. For greater safety Southwell was sent to Paris and studied at the College de Clermont under the tutelage of the Jesuit Thomas Darbyshire. He returned to Douai on 15 June 1577. A year later he set off on foot to Rome with the intention of joining the Society of Jesus. A two-year novitiate at Tournai was required before joining the Society, however, and initially he was denied entry. He appealed the decision by sending a heartfelt, emotional letter to the school. He bemoans the situation, writing, &quot;How can I but wast in anguish and agony that find myself disjoined from that company, severed from that Society, disunited from that body wherein lyeth all my life my love my whole hart and affection&quot; (Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu, Anglia 14, fol. 80, under date 1578).

His efforts succeeded as he was admitted to the probation house of Sant&#x27; Andrea on 17 October 1578 and in 1580 became a member of the Society of Jesus. Immediately after the completion of the novitiate, Southwell began studies in philosophy and theology at the Jesuit College in Rome. During this time, he worked as a secretary to the rector and writings of his are to be found among the school&#x27;s documents. Upon completion of his studies, Southwell was granted his BA in 1584, which was also the year of his ordination. He was appointed &quot;repetitor&quot; (tutor) in the Venerable English College at Rome and after two years became the prefect of studies there. It was in 1584 that an act was passed forbidding any English-born subject of Queen Elizabeth, who had entered into priests&#x27; orders in the Catholic Church since her accession, to remain in England longer than forty days on pain of death.

==On the English mission==
In 1586 Southwell, at his own request, was sent to England as a Jesuit missionary with Henry Garnet. He went from one Catholic family to another. The Jesuit William Weston had previously made his way to England, but he was arrested and sent to Wisbech Castle in 1587. The Garnet–Southwell Jesuit English mission is considered the third; the first such mission was that of Robert Parsons and Edmund Campion of 1580–1581.

A spy reported to Sir Francis Walsingham the Jesuits&#x27; landing on the east coast in July, but they arrived without molestation at the house at Hackney of William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden. In 1588 Southwell and Garnet were joined by John Gerard and Edward Oldcorne. Southwell was from the outset closely watched; he mixed furtively in Protestant society under the assumed name of Cotton. He studied the terms of sport, and used them in conversation. For the most part residing in London, he made occasional excursions to Sussex and the North.

In 1589 Southwell became domestic chaplain to Anne Howard, whose husband, the First Earl of Arundel, was in prison convicted of treason. Arundel had been confined to the Tower of London since 1585, but his execution was postponed, and he remained in prison till his death in 1595. Southwell took up his residence with the countess at Arundel House in The Strand, London. During 1591 he occupied most of his time in writing; although Southwell&#x27;s name was not publicly associated with any of his works, his literary activity was suspected by the government.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
After six years of missionary labour, Southwell was arrested at Uxendon Hall, Harrow. He was in the habit of visiting the house of Richard Bellamy who lived near Harrow and was under suspicion on account of his connection with Jerome Bellamy, who had been executed for sharing in Anthony Babington&#x27;s plot. One of the daughters, Anne Bellamy, was arrested and imprisoned in the gatehouse of Holborn for being linked to the situation. Having been interrogated and raped by Richard Topcliffe, the Queen&#x27;s chief priest-hunter and torturer, she revealed Southwell&#x27;s movements and he was immediately arrested.

He was first taken to Topcliffe&#x27;s own house, adjoining the Gatehouse Prison, where Topcliffe subjected him to the torture of &quot;the manacles&quot;. He remained silent in Topcliffe&#x27;s custody for forty hours. The queen then ordered Southwell moved to the Gatehouse, where a team of Privy Council torturers went to work on him. When they proved equally unsuccessful, he was left &quot;hurt, starving, covered with maggots and lice, to lie in his own filth&quot;. After about a month he was moved by order of the council to solitary confinement in the Tower of London. According to the early narratives, his father had petitioned the queen that his son, if guilty under the law, should so suffer, but if not should be treated as a gentleman, and that as his father he should be allowed to provide him with the necessities of life. No documentary evidence of such a petition survives, but something of the kind must have happened since his friends were able to provide him with food and clothing, and to send him the works of St. Bernard and a Bible. His superior Henry Garnet later smuggled a breviary to him. He remained in the Tower for three years, under Topcliffe&#x27;s supervision.

==Trial and execution==

In 1595 the Privy Council passed a resolution for Southwell&#x27;s prosecution on the charges of treason. He was removed from the Tower to Newgate Prison, where he was put into a hole called Limbo.

A few days later, Southwell appeared before the Lord Chief Justice, John Popham, at the bar of the King&#x27;s Bench. Popham made a speech against Jesuits and seminary priests. Southwell was indicted before the jury as a traitor under the statutes prohibiting the presence, within the kingdom, of priests ordained by Rome. Southwell admitted the facts but denied that he had &quot;entertained any designs or plots against the queen or kingdom&quot;. His only purpose, he said, in returning to England had been to administer the sacraments according to the rite of the Catholic Church to such as desired them. When asked to enter a plea, he declared himself &quot;not guilty of any treason whatsoever&quot;, objecting to a jury being made responsible for his death but allowing that he would be tried by God and country.

As the evidence was pressed, Southwell stated that he was the same age as &quot;our Saviour&quot;. He was immediately reproved by Topcliffe for insupportable pride in making the comparison, but he said in response that he considered himself &quot;a worm of the earth&quot;. After a brief recess, the jury returned with the predictable guilty verdict. The sentence of death was pronounced – to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He was returned through the city streets to Newgate.

On 21 February 1595, Southwell was sent to Tyburn. Execution of sentence on a notorious highwayman had been appointed for the same time, but at a different place – perhaps to draw the crowds away – and yet many came to witness Southwell&#x27;s death. Having been dragged through the streets on a sledge, he stood in the cart beneath the gibbet and made the sign of the cross with his pinioned hands before reciting a passage from the Christians&#x27; scriptures&#x27; Romans chapter 14. The sheriff made to interrupt him; but he was allowed to address the people at some length, confessing that he was a Jesuit priest and praying for the salvation of Queen and country. As the cart was drawn away, he commended his soul to God with the words of the psalm &quot;in manus tuas&quot;. He hung in the noose for a brief time, making the sign of the cross as best he could. As the executioner made to cut him down, in preparation for disembowelling him while still alive, Lord Mountjoy and some other onlookers tugged at his legs to hasten his death. His lifeless body was then disembowelled and quartered. As his severed head was displayed to the crowd, no one shouted the traditional &quot;Traitor!&quot;.

==Works and legacy==
Southwell addressed his &quot;Epistle of Comfort&quot; to Philip, Earl of Arundel. This and other of his religious tracts, &quot;A Short Rule of Good Life&quot;, &quot;Triumphs over Death&quot;, and a &quot;Humble Supplication to Queen Elizabeth&quot;, circulated in manuscript. &quot;Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Funeral Tears&quot; was openly published in 1591. It proved to be very popular, going through ten editions by 1636. Thomas Nashe&#x27;s imitation of &quot;Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Funeral Tears&quot; in &quot;Christ&#x27;s Tears over Jerusalem&quot; proves that the works received recognition outside of Catholic circles.

Soon after Southwell&#x27;s death, &quot;St Peter&#x27;s Complaint with other poems&quot; appeared, printed by John Windet for John Wolfe, but without the author&#x27;s name. A second edition, including eight more poems, appeared almost immediately. Then on 5 April, John Cawood, the publisher of &quot;Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Funeral Tears,&quot; who probably owned the copyright all along, entered the book in the Stationers&#x27; Register, and brought out a third edition. &quot;Saint Peter&#x27;s Complaint&quot; proved even more popular than &quot;Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Funeral Tears&quot;; it went into fourteen editions by 1636. Later that same year, another publisher, John Busby, having acquired a manuscript of Southwell&#x27;s collection of lyric poems, brought out a little book containing a further twenty-two poems, under the title &quot;Maeoniae&quot;. When in 1602 Cawood added another eight poems to his book, the English publication of Southwell&#x27;s works came to an end. Southwell&#x27;s &quot;Of the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar&quot;, unpublishable in England, appeared in a broadsheet published at Douai in 1606. &quot;A Foure fould Meditation of the foure last things&quot;, formerly attributed to Southwell, is by Philip Earl of Arundel. Similarly, the prose &quot;A Hundred Meditations of the Love of God&quot;, once thought to be an original work by Southwell, is now known to be his literary translation of Fray Diego de Estella&#x27;s &quot;Meditaciones devotisimas del amor de Dios&quot;.

Much of Southwell&#x27;s literary legacy rests on his considerable influence on other writers. There is evidence of Shakespeare&#x27;s allusions to Southwell&#x27;s work, particularly in The Merchant of Venice, Romeo &amp; Juliet, Hamlet, and King Lear. Southwell&#x27;s influence can be seen in the work of Donne, Herbert, Crashaw and Hopkins.

A memoir of Southwell was drawn up soon after his death. Much of the material was incorporated by Richard Challoner in his &quot;Memoirs of Missionary Priests &quot;(1741), and the manuscript is now in the Public Record Office in Brussels. See also Alexis Possoz, &quot;Vie du Pre R. Southwell&quot; (1866); and a life in Henry Foley&#x27;s &quot;Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus: historic facts illustrative of the labours and sufferings of its members in the 16th and 17th centuries&quot;, 1877 (i. 301387). Foley&#x27;s narrative includes copies of documents connected with his trial, and gives information on the original sources. The standard modern life, however, is Christopher Devlin&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Robert Southwell, Poet and Martyr&quot;, London, 1956.

As the prefatory letter to his poems &quot;The Author to his Loving Cousin&quot; implies, Southwell seems to have composed with a musical setting in mind. One such contemporary setting survives, Thomas Morley&#x27;s provision of music for stanzas from &quot;Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Complaint at Christ&#x27;s Death&quot; in his &quot;First book of ayres&quot; (1600). Elizabeth Grymeston, in a book published for her son (1604), described how she sang stanzas from &quot;Saint Peter&#x27;s Complaint&quot; as part of her daily prayer. The best-known modern setting of Southwell&#x27;s words is Benjamin Britten&#x27;s use of stanzas from &quot;New Heaven, New War&quot; and &quot;New Prince, New Pomp&quot;, two of the pieces in his &quot;Ceremony of Carols&quot; (1942).

In the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, Southwell and his companion and associate Henry Garnet were noted for their allegiance to the doctrine of mental reservation, a controversial ethical concept of the period.

Under Southwell&#x27;s Latinised name, Sotvellus, and in his memory, the English Jesuit Nathaniel Bacon, Secretary of the Society of Jesus, published the updated third edition of the &quot;Bibliotheca Scriptorum Societatis Iesu&quot; (Rome, 1676). This Jesuit bibliography containing more than 8000 authors made &quot;Sotvel&quot; a common reference.

Southwell was beatified in 1929 and canonised by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales on 25 October 1970.

Southwell is also the patron saint of Southwell House, a house in the London Oratory School in Fulham, London.

==Critical views==
In the view of the critic Helen C. White, probably no work of Southwell&#x27;s is more &quot;representative of his Baroque genius than the prose &quot;Marie Magdalens Funeral Teares&quot;, published late in 1591, close to the end of his career. The very choice of this subject would seem the epitome of the Baroque; for it is a commonplace that the penitent Magdalen, with her combination of past sensuality and current remorsefulness, was a favourite object of contemplation to the Counter-Reformation.&quot;

Southwell&#x27;s poetry is largely addressed to an English Catholic community under siege in post-Reformation Elizabethan England. Southwell endeavoured to convince remaining English Catholics that religious persecution by the State represented an opportunity for spiritual growth. In his view, martyrdom was one of the most sincere forms of religious devotion. Southwell&#x27;s poem &quot;Life is but Losse&quot; is an example of this concern. Throughout the seven stanzas, Southwell describes the martyrdom of English Catholics at the time, employing biblical figures of both Testaments (Samson and the Apostles). The poem&#x27;s title forewarns the reader of the pessimistic tone Southwell uses to describe life, as in the line &quot;Life is but losse, where death is deemed gaine.&quot; Being next to God is the perfect way to achieve spiritual bliss: &quot;To him I live, for him I hope to dye&quot; is Southwell&#x27;s manner of informing the reader of the reason for his existence, which does not end with death.

Southwell&#x27;s writing differs from that of the Neostoics of his time and the negative Stoic view of the passions in his belief in the creative value of passion. Some of Southwell&#x27;s contemporaries were also defenders of passion, but he was very selective when it came to where passions were directed. He was quoted as saying, &quot;Passions I allow, and loves I approve, only I would wish that men would alter their object and better their intent&quot;. He felt that he could use his writing to stir religious feelings, and it is this pattern in his writing that has caused scholars to declare him a leading Baroque writer.

Pierre Janelle published a study on Southwell in 1935 in which he recognized him as a pioneer Baroque figure, one of the first Baroque writers of the late 16th century and influential on numerous Baroque writers of the 17th century.

Ben Jonson remarked to Drummond of Hawthornden that &quot;so he had written that piece of [Southwell&#x27;s], &#x27;The Burning Babe&#x27;, he would have been content to destroy many of his.&quot; In fact, there is a strong case to be made for Southwell&#x27;s influence on his contemporaries and successors, among them Drayton, Lodge, Nashe, Herbert, Crashaw, and especially William Shakespeare, who seems to have known his work, both poetry and prose, extremely well.

More recently, the posthumously published 1873 first edition of Southwell&#x27;s literary translation into Elizabethan English of Fray Diego de Estella&#x27;s &quot;Meditaciónes devotíssimas del amor de Dios&quot; (&quot;A Hundred Meditations on the Love of God&quot;) helped inspire Fr. Gerard Manley Hopkins to write the poem &quot;The Windhover&quot;.

==Quotations==
*&quot;The Chief Justice asked how old he was, seeming to scorn his youth. He answered that he was near about the age of our Saviour, Who lived upon the earth thirty-three years; and he himself was as he thought near about thirty-four years. Hereat Topcliffe seemed to make great acclamation, saying that he compared himself to Christ. Father Southwell answered, &#x27;No he was a humble worm created by Christ.&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said Topcliffe, &#x27;you are Christ&#x27;s fellow.&#x27;&quot;—Father Henry Garnet, &quot;Account of the Trial of Robert Southwell,&quot; quoted in Caraman&#x27;s &quot;The Other Face&quot;, page 230.
*Southwell: I am decayed in memory with long and close imprisonment, and I have been tortured ten times. I had rather have endured ten executions. I speak not this for myself, but for others; that they may not be handled so inhumanely, to drive men to desperation, if it were possible.Topcliffe: If he were racked, let me die for it.Southwell: No; but it was as evil a torture, or late device.Topcliffe: I did but set him against a wall.Southwell: Thou art a bad man.Topcliffe: I would blow you all to dust if I could.Southwell: What, all?Topcliffe: Ay, all.Southwell: What, soul and body too? At his Trial 
*&quot;Not where I breathe, but where I love, I live&quot; on the outside of The DeNaples Center at the Jesuit University of Scranton. Longer version: &quot;Not where I breathe, but where I love, I live; / Not where I love, but where I am, I die.&quot;
*&quot;Hoist up saile while gale doth last, Tide and wind stay no man&#x27;s pleasure.&quot;—from &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Complaint. 1595&quot;
*&quot;May never was the month of love, For May is full of flowers; But rather April, wet by kind, For love is full of showers.&quot;—from &quot;Love&#x27;s Servile Lot&quot;
*&quot;My mind to me an empire is, While grace affordeth health.&quot;—from &quot;Look Home&quot;
*&quot;O dying souls, behold your living spring; O dazzled eyes, behold your sun of grace; Dull ears, attend what word this Word doth bring; Up, heavy hearts, with joy your joy embrace. From death, from dark, from deafness, from despair: This life, this light, this Word, this joy repairs.&quot;—from &quot;The Nativity of Christ&quot;
*&quot;A poet, a lover and a liar are by many reckoned but three words with one signification.&quot; – from &quot;The author to his loving cousin,&quot; published with &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Complaint.&quot; 1595.

<text>A front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (FR), also called Système Panhard is a powertrain layout with an engine in front and rear-wheel-drive, connected via a drive shaft. This arrangement, with the engine straddling the front axle, was the traditional automobile layout for most of the pre-1950s automotive mechanical projects. It is also used in trucks, pickups, and high-floor buses and school buses.

==Front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout==
A front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (FMR) places the engine in the front half of the vehicle but &quot;behind&quot; the front axle, which likewise drives the rear wheels via a driveshaft. Shifting the engine&#x27;s center of mass rearward aids in front/rear weight distribution and reduces the moment of inertia, both of which improve a vehicle&#x27;s handling.

FMR cars are often characterized by a long hood and front wheels that are pushed forward to the corners of the vehicle, close to the front bumper. 2+2-style grand tourers often have FMR layouts, as a rear engine does not leave much space for rear seats.
