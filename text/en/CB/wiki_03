<text>Terra sigillata is a term with at least three distinct meanings: as a description of medieval medicinal earth; in archaeology, as a general term for some of the fine red ancient Roman pottery with glossy surface slips made in specific areas of the Roman Empire; and more recently, as a description of a contemporary studio pottery technique supposedly inspired by ancient pottery. Usually roughly translated as &#x27;sealed earth&#x27;, the meaning of &#x27;terra sigillata&#x27; is &#x27;clay bearing little images&#x27; (latin &quot;sigilla&quot;), not &#x27;clay with a sealed (impervious) surface&#x27;. The archaeological term is applied, however, to plain-surfaced pots as well as those decorated with figures in relief, because it does not refer to the decoration but to the makers stamp impressed in the bottom of the vessel.

Terra sigillata as an archaeological term refers chiefly to a specific type of plain and decorated tableware made in Italy and in Gaul (France and the Rhineland) during the Roman Empire. These vessels have glossy surface slips ranging from a soft lustre to a brilliant glaze-like shine, in a characteristic colour range from pale orange to bright red; they were produced in standard shapes and sizes and were manufactured on an industrial scale and widely exported. The sigillata industries grew up in areas where there were existing traditions of pottery manufacture, and where the clay deposits proved suitable. The products of the Italian workshops are also known as Aretine ware from Arezzo and have been collected and admired since the Renaissance. The wares made in the Gaulish factories are often referred to by English-speaking archaeologists as samian ware. Closely related pottery fabrics made in the North African and Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire are not usually referred to as terra sigillata, but by more specific names, e.g. African red slip wares. All these types of pottery are significant for archaeologists: they can often be closely dated, and their distribution casts light on aspects of the ancient Roman economy.

Modern &quot;terra sig&quot; should be clearly distinguished from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods. The finish called &#x27;terra sigillata&#x27; by studio potters can be made from most clays, mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, &quot;terra sig&quot; can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this burnishing or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them. The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.

==Roman red gloss pottery==

In archaeological usage, the term &quot;terra sigillata&quot; without further qualification normally denotes the Arretine ware of Italy, made at Arezzo, and Gaulish samian ware manufactured first in South Gaul, particularly at La Graufesenque, near Millau, and later at Lezoux and adjacent sites near Clermont-Ferrand, and at east Gaulish sites such as Trier, Sinzig and Rheinzabern. These high-quality tablewares were particularly popular and widespread in the Western Roman Empire from about 50 BC to the early 3rd century AD. Definitions of &#x27;TS&#x27; have grown up from the earliest days of antiquarian studies, and are far from consistent; one survey of Classical art says:

&quot;Terra sigillata&quot; ... is a Latin term used by modern scholars to designate a class of decorated red-gloss pottery ... not all red-gloss ware was decorated, and hence the more inclusive term &#x27;Samian ware&#x27; is sometimes used to characterize all varieties of it.
Whereas Anthony King&#x27;s definition, following the more usual practice among Roman pottery specialists, makes no mention of decoration, but states that terra sigillata is &#x27;alternatively known as samian ware&#x27;. However, &#x27;samian ware&#x27; is normally used only to refer to the sub-class of terra sigillata made in ancient Gaul. In European languages other than English, terra sigillata, or a translation (e.g. &quot;terre sigillée&quot;), is always used for both Italian and Gaulish products. Nomenclature has to be established at an early stage of research into a subject, and antiquarians of the 18th and 19th centuries often used terms that we would not choose today, but as long as their meaning is clear and well-established, this does not matter, and detailed study of the history of the terminology is really a side-issue that is of academic interest only. Scholars writing in English now often use &quot;red gloss wares&quot; or &quot;red slip wares&quot;, both to avoid these issues of definition, and also because many other wares of the Roman period share aspects of technique with the traditional sigillata fabrics.
Italian and Gaulish TS vessels were made in standardised shapes constituting services of matching dishes, bowls and serving vessels. These changed and evolved over time, and have been very minutely classified; the first major scheme, by the German classical archaeologist Hans Dragendorff (1895), is still in use (as e.g. &quot;Dr.29&quot;), and there have been many others, such as the classifications of Déchelette, Knorr, Hermet, Walters, Curle, Loeschcke, Ritterling, Hermet and Ludowici, and more recently, the &quot;Conspectus&quot; of Arretine forms and Hayes&#x27;s type-series of African Red Slip and Eastern sigillatas. These reference sometimes make it possible to date the manufacture of a broken decorated sherd to within 20 years or less.

Most of the forms that were decorated with figures in low relief were thrown in pottery moulds, the inner surfaces of which had been decorated using fired-clay stamps or punches (usually referred to as &quot;poinçons&quot;) and some free-hand work using a stylus. The mould was therefore decorated on its interior surface with a full decorative design of impressed, intaglio (hollowed) motifs that would appear in low relief on any bowl formed in it. As the bowl dried, the shrinkage was sufficient for it to be withdrawn from the mould, in order to carry out any finishing work, which might include the addition of foot-rings, the shaping and finishing of rims, and in all cases the application of the slip. Barbotine and appliqué (&#x27;sprigged&#x27;) techniques were sometimes used to decorate vessels of closed forms. Study of the characteristic decorative motifs, combined in some cases with name-stamps of workshops incorporated into the decoration, and also sometimes with the cursive signatures of mouldmakers, makes it possible to build up a very detailed knowledge of the industry. Careful observation of form and fabric is therefore usually enough for an archaeologist experienced in the study of sigillata to date and identify a broken sherd: a potter&#x27;s stamp or moulded decoration provides even more precise evidence. The classic guide by Oswald and Pryce, published in 1920 set out many of the principles, but the literature on the subject goes back into the 19th century, and is now extremely voluminous, including many monographs on specific regions, as well as excavation reports on important sites that have produced significant assemblages of sigillata wares, and articles in learned journals, some of which are dedicated to Roman pottery studies.

The motifs and designs on the relief-decorated wares echo the general traditions of Graeco-Roman decorative arts, with depictions of deities, references to myths and legends, and popular themes such as hunting and erotic scenes. Individual figure-types, like the vessel-shapes, have been classified, and in many cases they may be linked with specific potters or workshops. Some of the decoration relates to contemporary architectural ornament, with egg-and-tongue (ovolo) mouldings, acanthus and vine scrolls and the like. While the decoration of Arretine ware is often highly naturalistic in style, and is closely comparable with silver tableware of the same period, the designs on the Gaulish products, made by provincial artisans adopting Classical subjects, are intriguing for their expression of &#x27;romanisation&#x27;, the fusion of Classical and native cultural and artistic traditions.

Many of the Gaulish manufacturing sites have been extensively excavated and studied. At La Graufesenque in southern Gaul, documentary evidence in the form of lists or tallies apparently fired with single kiln-loads, giving potters&#x27; names and numbers of pots have long been known, and they suggest very large loads of 25,000–30,000 vessels. Though not all the kilns at this, or other, manufacturing sites were so large, the excavation of the &quot;grand four&quot; (big kiln) at La Graufesenque, which was in use in the late 1st and early 2nd century, confirms the scale of the industry. It is a rectangular stone-built structure measuring 11.3 m. by 6.8 m. externally, with an original height estimated at 7 metres. With up to nine &#x27;storeys&#x27; within (dismantled after each firing), formed of tile floors and vertical columns in the form of clay pipes or tubes, which also served to conduct the heat, it has been estimated that it was capable of firing 30,000–40,000 vessels at a time, at a temperature of around 1000 °C.

A 2005 work has shown that the slip is a matrix of mainly silicon and aluminium oxides, within which are suspended sub-microscopic crystals of haematite and corundum. The matrix itself does not contain any metallic ions, the haematite is substituted in aluminium and titanium while the corundum is substituted in iron. The two crystal populations are homogenously dispersed within the matrix. The colour of haematite depends on the crystal size. Large crystals of this mineral are black but as the size decreases to sub-micron the colour shifts to red. The fraction of aluminium has a similar effect. It was formerly thought that the difference between &#x27;red&#x27; and &#x27;black&#x27; samian was due to the presence (black) or absence (red) of reducing gases from the kiln and that the construction of the kiln was so arranged as to prevent the reducing gases from the fuel from coming into contact with the pottery. The presence of iron oxides in the clay/slip was thought to be reflected in the colour according to the oxidation state of the iron (Fe[III] for the red and Fe[II] for the black, the latter produced by the reducing gases coming into contact with the pottery during firing). It now appears as a result of this recent work that this is not the case and that the colour of the glossy slip is in fact due to no more than the crystal size of the minerals dispersed within the matrix glass.

===Forerunners===

Arretine ware, in spite of its very distinctive appearance, was an integral part of the wider picture of fine ceramic tablewares in the Graeco-Roman world of the Hellenistic and early Roman period. That picture must itself be seen in relation to the luxury tablewares made of silver. Centuries before Italian terra sigillata was made, Attic painted vases, and later their regional variants made in Italy, involved the preparation of a very fine clay body covered with a slip that fired to a glossy surface without the need for any polishing or burnishing. Greek painted wares also involved the precise understanding and control of firing conditions to achieve the contrasts of black and red.

Glossy-slipped black pottery made in Etruria and Campania continued this technological tradition, though painted decoration gave way to simpler stamped motifs and in some cases, to applied motifs moulded in relief. The tradition of decorating entire vessels in low relief was also well established in Greece and Asia Minor by the time the Arretine industry began to expand in the middle of the 1st century BC, and examples were imported into Italy. Relief-decorated cups, some in lead-glazed wares, were produced at several eastern centres, and undoubtedly played a part in the technical and stylistic evolution of decorated Arretine, but Megarian bowls, made chiefly in Greece and Asia Minor, are usually seen as the most direct inspiration. These are small, hemispherical bowls without foot-rings, and their decoration is frequently very reminiscent of contemporary silver bowls, with formalised, radiating patterns of leaves and flowers. The crisp and precisely profiled forms of the plain dishes and cups were also part of a natural evolution of taste and fashion in the Mediterranean world of the 1st century BC.

===Arretine ware===
Arretine ware began to be manufactured at and near Arezzo (Tuscany) a little before the middle of the 1st century BC. The industry expanded rapidly in a period when Roman political and military influence was spreading far beyond Italy: for the inhabitants of the first provinces of the Roman Empire in the reign of the Emperor Augustus (&quot;reg.&quot; 27 BC – AD 14), this tableware, with its precise forms, shiny surface, and, on the decorated vessels, its visual introduction to Classical art and mythology, must have deeply impressed some inhabitants of the new northern provinces of the Empire. Certainly it epitomised certain aspects of Roman taste and technical expertise. Pottery industries in the areas we now call north-east France and Belgium quickly began to copy the shapes of plain Arretine dishes and cups in the wares now known as Gallo-Belgic, and in South and Central Gaul, it was not long before local potters also began to emulate the mould-made decoration and the glossy red slip itself.

The most recognisable decorated Arretine form is Dragendorff 11, a large, deep goblet on a high pedestal base, closely resembling some silver table vessels of the same period, such as the Warren Cup. The iconography, too, tended to match the subjects and styles seen on silver plate, namely mythological and genre scenes, including erotic subjects, and small decorative details of swags, leafy wreaths and ovolo (egg-and-tongue) borders that may be compared with elements of Augustan architectural ornament. The deep form of the Dr.11 allowed the &quot;poinçons&quot; (stamps) used making the moulds of human and animal figures to be fairly large, often about 5–6 cm high, and the modelling is frequently very accomplished indeed, attracting the interest of modern art-historians as well as archaeologists. Major workshops, such as those of M.Perennius Tigranus, P. Cornelius and Cn. Ateius, stamped their products, and the names of the factory-owners and of the workers within the factories, which often appear on completed bowls and on plain wares, have been extensively studied, as have the forms of the vessels, and the details of their dating and distribution.

Italian sigillata was not made only at or near Arezzo itself: some of the important Arezzo businesses had branch factories in Pisa, the Po valley and at other Italian cities. By the beginning of the 1st century AD, some of them had set up branch factories in Gaul, for example at La Muette near Lyon in Central Gaul. Nor were the classic wares of the Augustan period the only forms of terra sigillata made in Italy: later industries in the Po Valley and elsewhere continued the tradition.

In the Middle Ages, examples of the ware that were serendipitously discovered in digging foundations in Arezzo drew admiring attention as early as the 13th century, when Restoro d&#x27;Arezzo&#x27;s massive encyclopedia included a chapter praising the refined Roman ware discovered in his native city, &quot;what is perhaps the first account of an aspect of ancient art to be written since classical times&quot;. The chronicler Giovanni Villani also mentioned the ware.

The first published study of Arretine ware was that of Fabroni in 1841, and by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German scholars in particular had made great advances in systematically studying and understanding both Arretine ware and the Gaulish samian that occurred on Roman military sites being excavated in Germany. Dragendorff&#x27;s classification was expanded by other scholars, including S. Loeschcke in his study of the Italian sigillata excavated at the early Roman site of Haltern. Research on Arretine ware has continued very actively throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, for example with the publication and revision of an inventory of the known potter&#x27;s stamps (&quot;Oxé-Comfort-Kenrick&quot;) and the development of a &quot;Conspectus&quot; of vessel forms, bringing earlier work on the respective topics up to date. Catalogues of the punch motives and the workshops of Arretine Sigillata were published in 2004 and 2009, respectively, and a catalogue on the known appliqué motifs appeared in 2024. As with all ancient pottery studies, each generation asks new questions and applies new techniques (such as analysis of clays) in the attempt to find the answers.

===South Gaulish samian ware===

Sigillata vessels, both plain and decorated, were manufactured at several centres in southern France, including Bram, Montans, La Graufesenque, Le Rozier and Banassac, from the late 1st century BC: of these, La Graufesenque, near Millau, was the principal producer and exporter. Although the establishment of sigillata potteries in Gaul may well have arisen initially to meet local demand and to undercut the prices of imported Italian goods, they became enormously successful in their own right, and by the later 1st century AD, South Gaulish samian was being exported not only to other provinces in the north-west of the Empire, but also to Italy and other regions of the Mediterranean, North Africa and even the eastern Empire. One of the finds in the ruins of Pompeii, destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in August AD 79, was a consignment of South Gaulish sigillata, still in its packing crate; like all finds from the Vesuvian sites, this hoard of pottery is invaluable as dating evidence.

South Gaulish samian typically has a redder slip and deeper pink fabric than Italian sigillata. The best slips, vivid red and of an almost mirror-like brilliance, were achieved during the Claudian and early Neronian periods (Claudius, &quot;reg&quot;. AD 41–54; Nero, &quot;reg&quot;. AD 54–68). At the same period, some workshops experimented briefly with a marbled red-and-yellow slip, a variant that never became generally popular. Early production of plain forms in South Gaul initially followed the Italian models closely, and even the characteristic Arretine decorated form, Dragendorff 11, was made. But many new shapes quickly evolved, and by the second half of the 1st century AD, when Italian sigillata was no longer influential, South Gaulish samian had created its own characteristic repertoire of forms. The two principal decorated forms were Dragendorff 30, a deep, cylindrical bowl, and Dragendorff 29, a carinated (&#x27;keeled&#x27;) shallow bowl with a marked angle, emphasised by a moulding, mid-way down the profile. The footring is low, and potters&#x27; stamps are usually bowl-maker&#x27;s marks placed in the interior base, so that vessels made from the same, or parallel, moulds may bear different names. The rim of the 29, small and upright in early examples of the form, but much deeper and more everted by the 70s of the 1st century, is finished with rouletted decoration, and the relief-decorated surfaces necessarily fall into two narrow zones. These were usually decorated with floral and foliate designs of wreaths and scrolls at first: the Dr.29 resting on its rim illustrated in the lead section of this article is an early example, less angular than the developed form of the 60s and 70s, with decoration consisting of simple, very elegant leaf-scrolls. Small human and animal figures, and more complex designs set out in separate panels, became more popular by the 70s of the 1st century. Larger human and animal figures could be used on the Dr.30 vessels, but while many of these have great charm, South Gaulish craftsmen never achieved, and perhaps never aspired to, the Classical naturalism of some of their Italian counterparts.

In the last two decades of the 1st century, the Dragendorff 37, a deep, rounded vessel with a plain upright rim, overtook the 29 in popularity. This simple shape remained the standard Gaulish samian relief-decorated form, from all Gaulish manufacturing regions, for more than a century. Small relief-decorated beakers such as forms Déchelette 67 and Knorr 78 were also made in South Gaul, as were occasional &#x27;one-off&#x27; or very ambitious mould-made vessels, such as large thin-walled flagons and flasks. But the mass of South Gaulish samian found on Roman sites of the 1st century AD consists of plain dishes, bowls and cups, especially Dr.18 (a shallow dish) and Dr.27 (a little cup with a distinctive double curve to the profile), many of which bear potters&#x27; name-stamps, and the large decorated forms 29, 30 and 37.

A local industry inspired by Arretine and South Gaulish imports grew up in the Iberian provinces in the 1st century AD. &quot;Terra sigillata hispanica&quot; developed its own distinctive forms and designs, and continued in production into the late Roman period, the 4th and 5th centuries AD. It was not exported to other regions.

===Central Gaulish samian ware===
The principal Central Gaulish samian potteries were situated at Lezoux and Les Martres-de-Veyre, not far from Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne. Production had already begun at Lezoux in the Augustan period (Augustus, &quot;reg&quot;. 27 BC–AD 14), but it was not until the reign of Trajan (AD 98–117), and the beginning of a decline in the South Gaulish export trade, that Central Gaulish samian ware became important outside its own region. Though it never achieved the extensive geographical distribution of the South Gaulish factories, in the provinces of Gaul and Britain, it was by far the most common type of fine tableware, plain and decorated, in use during the 2nd century AD. The quality of the ware and the slip is usually excellent, and some of the products of Les Martres-de-Veyre, in particular, are outstanding, with a lustrous slip and a very hard, dense body. The surface colour tends towards a more orange-red hue than the typical South Gaulish slips.

Vessel-forms that had been made in South Gaul continued to be produced, though as the decades passed, they evolved and changed with the normal shifts of fashion, and some new shapes were created, such as the plain bowl with a horizontal flange below the rim, Dr.38. Mortaria, food-preparation bowls with a gritted interior surface, were also made in Central Gaulish samian fabric in the second half of the 2nd century (Dr.45). There is a small sub-class of Central Gaulish samian ware with a glossy black slip, though the dividing line between black terra sigillata and other fine black-gloss wares, which were also manufactured in the area, is sometimes hazy. When a vessel is a classic samian form and decorated in relief in the style of a known samian potter, but finished with black slip rather than a red one, it may be classed as black samian.

Though the Central Gaulish forms continued and built upon the South Gaulish traditions, the decoration of the principal decorated forms, Dr.30 and Dr.37, was distinctive. New human and animal figure-types appeared, generally modelled with greater realism and sophistication than those of La Graufesenque and other South Gaulish centres. Figure-types and decorative details have been classified, and can often be linked to specific workshops Lezoux wares also included vases decorated with barbotine relief, with appliqué motifs, and a class usually referred to as &#x27;cut-glass&#x27; decoration, with geometric patterns cut into the surface of the vessel before slipping and firing. Two standard &#x27;plain&#x27; types made in considerable numbers in Central Gaul also included barbotine decoration, Dr.35 and 36, a matching cup and dish with a curved horizontal rim embellished with a stylised scroll of leaves in relief.

During the second half of the 2nd century, some Lezoux workshops making relief-decorated bowls, above all that of Cinnamus, dominated the market with their large production. The wares of Cinnamus, Paternus, Divixtus, Doeccus, Advocisus, Albucius and some others often included large, easily legible name-stamps incorporated into the decoration, clearly acting as brand-names or advertisements. Though these vessels were very competently made, they are heavy and somewhat coarse in form and finish compared with earlier Gaulish samian ware.

From the end of the 2nd century, the export of sigillata from Central Gaul rapidly, perhaps even abruptly, ceased. Pottery production continued, but in the 3rd century, it reverted to being a local industry.

===East Gaulish samian ware===
There were numerous potteries manufacturing terra sigillata in East Gaul, which included Alsace, the Saarland, and the Rhine and Mosel regions, but while the samian pottery from Luxeuil, La Madeleine, Chémery-Faulquemont, Lavoye, Remagen, Sinzig, Blickweiler and other sites is of interest and importance mainly to specialists, two sources stand out because their wares are often found outside their own immediate areas, namely Rheinzabern, near Speyer, and Trier.

The Trier potteries evidently began to make samian vessels around the beginning of the 2nd century AD, and were still active until the middle of the 3rd century. The styles and the potters have been divided by scholars into two main phases, Werkstatten I and II. Some of the later mould-made Dr.37 bowls are of very poor quality, with crude decoration and careless finishing.

The Rheinzabern kilns and their products have been studied since Wilhelm Ludowici (1855–1929) began to excavate there in 1901, and to publish his results in a series of detailed reports. Rheinzabern produced both decorated and plain forms for around a century from the middle of the 2nd century. Some of the Dr.37 bowls, for example those with the workshop stamp of Ianus, bear comparison with Central Gaulish products of the same date: others are less successful. But the real strength of the Rheinzabern industry lay in its extensive production of good-quality samian cups, beakers, flagons and vases, many imaginatively decorated with barbotine designs or in the &#x27;cut-glass&#x27; incised technique. Ludowici created his own type-series, which sometimes overlaps with those of other sigillata specialists. Ludowici&#x27;s types use combinations of upper- and lower-case letters rather than simple numbers, the first letter referring to the general shape, such as &#x27;T&#x27; for &quot;Teller&quot; (dish).

In general, the products of the East Gaulish industries moved away from the early imperial Mediterranean tradition of intricately profiled dishes and cups, and ornamented bowls made in moulds, and converged with the later Roman local traditions of pottery-making in the northern provinces, using free-thrown, rounded forms and creating relief designs with freehand slip-trailing. Fashions in fine tablewares were changing. Some East Gaulish producers made bowls and cups decorated only with rouletted or stamped decoration, and in the 3rd and 4th centuries, Argonne ware, decorated with all-over patterns of small stamps, was made in the area east of Rheims and quite widely traded. Argonne ware was essentially still a type of sigillata, and the most characteristic form is a small, sturdy Dr.37 bowl. Small, localised attempts to make conventional relief-decorated samian ware included a brief and unsuccessful venture at Colchester in Britain, apparently initiated by potters from the East Gaulish factories at Sinzig, a centre that was itself an offshoot of the Trier workshops.

===Eastern sigillatas===
In the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, there had been several industries making fine red tablewares with smooth, glossy-slipped surfaces since about the middle of the 2nd century BC, well before the rise of the Italian sigillata workshops. By the 1st century BC, their forms often paralleled Arretine plain-ware shapes quite closely. There were evidently centres of production in Syria; in western Turkey, exported through Ephesos; Pergamon; Çandarlı, near Pergamon; and on Cyprus, but archaeologists often refer to eastern sigillata A from Northern Syria, eastern sigillata B from Tralles in Asia Minor, eastern sigillata C from ancient Pitane, and eastern sigillata D (or Cypriot sigillata) from Cyprus, as there is still much to be learnt about this material. While eastern sigillata C is known to come from Çandarli (ancient Pitane), there were likely other workshops in the wider region of Pergamon. By the early 2nd century AD, when Gaulish samian was completely dominating the markets in the Northern provinces, the eastern sigillatas were themselves beginning to be displaced by the rising importance of African Red Slip wares in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Empire. In the fourth century AD, Phocaean red slip appears as a successor to Eastern sigillata C.

In the 1980s two primary groups of Eastern Terra Sigillata in the Eastern Mediterranean basin were distinguished as ETS-I and ETS-II based on their chemical fingerprints as shown by analysis by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). ETS-I originated in Eastern Cyprus, whereas the ETS-II was probably made in Pamphylia, at Perge, Aspendos and Side. However this classification has been criticized, and is not universally accepted. A potter&#x27;s quarter at Sagalassos inland from the southern Turkish coast has been excavated since it was discovered in 1987, and its wares traced to many sites in the region. It was active from around 25 to 550 AD.

===African red slip ware===

African red slip ware (ARS) was the final development of terra sigillata. While the products of the Italian and Gaulish red-gloss industries flourished and were exported from their places of manufacture for at most a century or two each, ARS production continued for more than 500 years. The centres of production were in the Roman provinces of Africa Proconsularis, Byzacena and Numidia; that is, modern Tunisia and part of eastern Algeria. From about the 4th century AD, competent copies of the fabric and forms were also made in several other regions, including Asia Minor, the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt. Over the long period of production, there was obviously much change and evolution in both forms and fabrics. Both Italian and Gaulish plain forms influenced ARS in the 1st and 2nd centuries (for example, Hayes Form 2, the cup or dish with an outcurved rim decorated with barbotine leaves, is a direct copy of the samian forms Dr.35 and 36, made in South and Central Gaul), but over time a distinctive ARS repertoire developed.

There was a wide range of dishes and bowls, many with rouletted or stamped decoration, and closed forms such as tall ovoid flagons with appliqué ornament (Hayes Form 171). The ambitious large rectangular dishes with relief decoration in the centre and on the wide rims (Hayes Form 56), were clearly inspired by decorated silver platters of the 4th century, which were made in rectangular and polygonal shapes as well as in the traditional circular form. Decorative motifs reflected not only the Graeco-Roman traditions of the Mediterranean, but eventually the rise of Christianity as well. There is a great variety of monogram crosses and plain crosses amongst the stamps.

==Gallery of Roman terra sigillata==
==Modern pottery==
In contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term &quot;terra sigillata&quot; refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary ceramic art, &#x27;terra sigillata&#x27; describes only a watery refined slip used to facilitate the burnishing of raw clay surfaces to promote glossy surface effects in low fire techniques, including primitive and unglazed alternative western-style Raku firing. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature glazed ceramic techniques.

However, ancient terra sigillata vessels also became popular collector&#x27;s items in modern times and were therefore repeatedly forged.

In 1906 the German potter Karl Fischer re-invented the method of making terra sigillata of Roman quality and obtained patent protection for this procedure at the &quot;Kaiserliche Patentamt&quot; in Berlin.

===Making modern terra sigillata===
Modern terra sigillata is made by allowing the clay particles to separate into layers by particle size. A deflocculant such as sodium silicate or sodium hexametaphosphate is often added to the watery clay/water slip mixture to facilitate separation of fine particle flocs or aggregates. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. The top layer is water, the center layer is the terra sigillata and the bottom layer is the sludge. Siphoning off the middle layers of &quot;sig&quot; which contain the smallest clay particles, produces terra sigillata. The remaining larger clay-particle bottom layers are discarded.

Terra sigillata is usually brushed or sprayed in thin layers onto dry or almost dry unfired ware. The ware is then burnished with a soft cloth before the water in the terra sigillata soaks into the porous body or with a hard, smooth-surfaced object . The burnished ware is fired, often to a lower temperature than normal bisque temperature of approximately 900 °C. Higher firing temperatures tend to remove the burnished effect because the clay particles start to recrystallize.

===Reuse of Roman pottery===
Since the 18th century Samian ware pots have been found in sufficient numbers in the sea near Whitstable and Herne Bay that local people used them for cooking.

==Medicinal earth==
The oldest use for the term terra sigillata was for a medicinal clay from the island of Lemnos. The latter was called &quot;sealed&quot; because cakes of it were pressed together and stamped with the head of Artemis. Later, it bore the seal of the Ottoman sultan. This soil&#x27;s particular mineral content was such that, in the Renaissance, it was seen as a proof against poisoning, as well as a general cure for any bodily impurities, and it was highly prized as a medicine and medicinal component.
In 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold traveled around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata made from a special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now Strzegom, Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a panacea effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.

<text>Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane (, , 12 June 1919 – 26 November 1989) was a top Comorian politician. He was a member of the French Senate from 1959 to 1973, and President of the Comoros from 25 October 1978 until his assassination in 1989.

==Life prior to the presidency==
Abdallah was born in Domoni, on the island of Anjouan. He began participating in the government in the 1940s, while the Comoros were still part of France. He was the President of the general council from 1949 until 1953, and was the chairman of the Chamber of Deputies from April 1970 to June 1970.

==First presidency==

In 1972, Abdallah, now leader of his political party, the Comoros Democratic Union (UDC), became president of the government council and Chief Minister of the Comoros; he served in that position until 6 July 1975, when the islands became independent from France, (with the exception of Mayotte, which voted to remain part of France.) Abdallah became the first president of the independent islands, but was overthrown by Said Mohamed Jaffar in a coup d&#x27;état on 3 August 1975. Jaffar, in turn, would be overthrown by Ali Soilih in 1976.

==Second presidency==
Abdallah (who had been living in exile Paris, France) was the nominal leader of the coup staged by mercenary Bob Denard on 13 May 1978. After Said Atthoumani had served as &quot;Chairman of the Politico-Military Directorate&quot; for ten days, Abdallah and Mohamed Ahmed assumed the titles of &quot;Co-Chairmen of the Politico-Military Directorate&quot;. On 22 July, their titles were changed to &quot;Co-Chairmen of the Directorate,&quot; and on 3 October, Abdallah became the lone chair. Abdallah was in fact a puppet leader with no power to make decisions of his own, and the real ruler of the Comoros was Denard, who served as the commander of the Presidential Guard.

On 25 October, Abdallah assumed the title of president and remained in office until his death, despite three separate coup attempts against him. In 1982, Abdallah had the UDC and all other parties abolished, and a new party, the Comorian Union for Progress (UCP), was set up. The Comoros became a one-party state, with the UCP being the only legal party, the regime became dictatorial, supervised by mercenaries who controlled the country and avoided various coup attempts. Some opponents of the regime are executed or disappear during this period. The only candidate to be allowed to stand for election, Ahmed Abdallah was re-elected on 30 September 1984, and his party won all seats in the Federal Assembly on 22 May 1987. During this time, Denard proceeded to plunder the Comorian economy as he became the largest single landowner in the Comoros, taking over all the best land, which he then developed into luxury hotel resorts for wealthy Western tourists who wished to enjoy the tropics. 

==Assassination==

On 26 November 1989, he was shot dead in his Moroni office under highly disputed circumstances. It is generally believed that Denard had Abdallah assassinated for trying to dismiss him as commander of the Presidential Guard.  At his trial in 1999 for Abdallah&#x27;s murder in Paris, Denard claimed that Abdallah was assassinated by Abdallah Jaffar during a coup led by Ali Soilih&#x27;s half-brother, Said Mohamed Djohar. Denard was acquitted for a lack of evidence as the judge ruled that the prosecution made only a circumstantial case that Denard was behind Abdallah&#x27;s murder. Djohar took control of the country the next day. Denard tried to prevent Djohar from assuming the presidency, but this time, France, which found Denard an embarrassment, sent in military forces to gently usher Denard and his mercenaries out of the Comoros.

<doc id="795227" wikidata="Q7158234" url="?curid=795227" title="Pearlridge Center">
<text>Pearlridge Center is the second largest shopping center in Hawaii, after Ala Moana, and is Hawaii&#x27;s largest enclosed shopping center, located in Aiea. Opened in 1972 and expanded in 1976, the enclosed mall is split into three &quot;phases&quot; (Uptown, Downtown, and Phase Three) and overlooks historic Pearl Harbor and the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. The property includes the only monorail in Hawaii, the only emergency clinic located on mall property (Pali Momi Medical Center), and an eight-story office complex (Pearlridge Office Center). The mall is owned by Washington Prime Group, and is on land owned by Kamehameha Schools.

It is served by Kalauao (Pearl Highlands) station on the Honolulu Skyline.

==History==
Pearlridge opened in 1972 with the Pearlridge Uptown. Pearlridge Uptown was anchored by JCPenney, Shirokiya, and Liberty House. In addition to this, Sears opened as a stand-alone store before Pearlridge Downtown opened. In 1976, Pearlridge Downtown opened and its Skycab as well. When Pearlridge Downtown opened, it was also anchored by Hawaii&#x27;s first Daiei store and Fun Factory location.

In 1980 after Daiei purchased the Holiday Mart stores, they closed its Pearlridge store and relocated to the Holiday Mart Pearl City location. The movie theater would move from being near the Office Center and into the former Daiei space.

In 2004, after JCPenney shut down in Hawaii, the space formerly occupied by the anchor was converted into part of the mall. This would be initially anchored by Borders and Price Busters.

In 2018, Pearlridge Downtown was renovated which included the closure of Fun Factory, and the addition of shops like Uncles Grill. These would be completed in 2019.

In 2021, Sears would be closed and as of 2024, it remains vacant to this day.

==Complex==
Pearlridge consists of two major shopping areas: Pearlridge Uptown and Pearlridge Downtown. There are also two minor strip malls, Pearlridge East and Pearlridge West. The two major shopping areas are connected by the only monorail system in Hawaii. Pearlridge primary anchor tenants include: Macy&#x27;s (formerly Liberty House) and, until 2021, Sears. There are over 170 stores and restaurants with two food courts, and a movie theater complex with sixteen screens.

===Stand-alone stores===
Not attached to any of the main Pearlridge buildings on either side (Ewa or Diamond Head sides) of Pali Momi Medical Center are several stand-alone stores: Anna Miller&#x27;s, and Inspiration Pop Up. Ross Dress for Less moved into the space vacated by Borders, which closed in 2011. The building formerly occupied by Inspiration Furniture is now occupied by Pali Momi Medical Center. Two thirds of GAP, also closed, is now owned by Victoria&#x27;s Secret, while the other one third is currently unoccupied. As of 2024, this stub is now occupied by a Express store.

Originally, Pearlridge West was anchored by a Star Markets supermarket but was closed in 1994 to become a Circuit City. Circuit City operated in Pearlridge West until it closed in 2009 due to bankruptcy. It was replaced by Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in Fall 2010. In 2023, the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond closed following its bankruptcy. As of 2024, the former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond remains vacant.

===Stand-alone restaurants===
Pearlridge also hosts several stand-alone restaurants in the mall property. Pearlridge West hosts Anna Miller&#x27;s and Bravo Restaurant. Near Uptown is Fuji Sushi and Teppanyaki, while Downtown hosts Chili&#x27;s, California Pizza Kitchen, and Big City Diner. The space once occupied by Sizzler was demolished to become a Bank of Hawaii location.

===Pearlridge Office Center===
The Pearlridge Office Center is an eight-story office complex mainly housing financial and professional suites located towards Pearlridge East.

===Sumida Farm===
A unique landmark of Pearlridge is Sumida Farm, Hawaii&#x27;s largest watercress farm, leased on land owned by Kamehameha Schools.

==Transportation==

===Skycab===

One of Pearlridge&#x27;s most distinctive landmarks is the Skycab, Hawaii&#x27;s only monorail system. Connecting both Uptown and Downtown, it provides a unique transport and a notable focal point of the center. Rides cost $1.00 one way. The monorail first ran on November 7, 1977, and was built by Rohr Industries.

===Skyline===

Pearlridge is also served by Kalauao (Pearlridge) station on the Honolulu Skyline. After much delays, the Skyline opened to the public on June 30, 2023.

<doc id="795239" wikidata="Q729032" url="?curid=795239" title="Luigi Carlo Farini">
<text>Luigi Carlo Farini (22 October 1812 – 1 August 1866) was an Italian physician, statesman and historian.

==Biography==
Farini was born at Russi, in what is now the province of Ravenna.

After completing a brilliant university course at Bologna, which he interrupted to take part in the revolution of 1831, he practised as a physician at Russi and at Ravenna. He acquired a considerable reputation, but in 1843 his political opinions brought him under the suspicion of the police and caused his expulsion from the papal states. He resided successively in Florence and Paris, and travelled about Europe as private physician to Prince Jérôme Bonaparte, but when Pius IX was elected to the Holy See and began his reign with apparently Liberal and nationalist tendencies, Farini returned to Italy and was appointed secretary-general to G Recchi, the minister of the interior (March 1848).

But he held office for little more than a month, since like all the other Italian Liberals he disapproved of the Pius IX&#x27;s change of front in refusing to allow his troops to fight against Austria, and resigned with the rest of the ministry on 29 April. Pius, wishing to counteract the effect of this policy, sent Farini to Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, to hand over the command of the papal contingent to him. Elected member of parliament for Faenza, he was again appointed secretary to the ministry of the interior in the Mamiani cabinet, and later director-general of the public health department.

He resigned office on the proclamation of the republic after the flight of the pope to Gaeta in 1849, resumed it for a while when Pius returned to Rome with the protection of French arms, but when a reactionary and priestly policy was instituted, he went into exile and took up his residence at Turin. There he became convinced that it was only through the House of Savoy that Italy could be liberated, and he expounded his views in Cavour&#x27;s paper &quot;Il Risorgimento&quot;, in &quot;La Frusta&quot; and &quot;Il Piemonte&quot;, of which latter he was at one time editor. He also wrote his chief historical work, &quot;Lo Stato Romano dal 1815 al 1850&quot;, in four volumes (Turin, 1850).

In 1851 he was appointed minister of public instruction in the D&#x27;Azeglio cabinet, an office which he held till May 1852. As a member of the Sardinian parliament and as a journalist Farini was one of the staunchest supporters of Cavour, and strongly favoured the proposal that Piedmont should participate in the Crimean War, if indeed he was not actually the first to suggest that policy. In 1856 and 1857 he published two letters to British liberal statesman William Ewart Gladstone on Italian affairs, which created a sensation, while he continued to propagate his views in the Italian press.

When on the outbreak of the war of 1859 Francis V, duke of Modena, was expelled and a provisional government set up, Farini was sent as Piedmontese commissioner to that city; but, although recalled after the peace of Villafranca which ended the Second Italian War of Independence, he was determined on the annexation of central Italy to Sardinia/Piedmont and remained behind, becoming a Modenese citizen and dictator of the state. He negotiated an alliance with Parma, Romagna and Tuscany, when other provisional governments had been established, and entrusted the task of organizing an army for this central Italian league to General Fanti.

Annexation to Piedmont having been voted by plebiscite and the opposition of Napoleon III having been overcome, Farini returned to Turin, where the king conferred on him the order of the Annunziata and Cavour appointed him minister of the interior (June 1860), and subsequently viceroy of Naples; but he soon resigned because of ill-health. Cavour died in 1861, and the following year, Farini succeeded Rattazzi as premier, in which office he endeavoured to carry out Cavour&#x27;s policy. Overexertion, however, brought on softening of the brain, which compelled him to resign office on 24 March 1863, and ultimately resulted in his death in poverty at Quarto dei Mille in Genoa. He was buried at Turin, but in 1878 his remains were removed to his native village of Russi.

His son Domenico Farini also had a distinguished political career and was President of the Chamber of Deputies and President of the Senate three times .

<text>The Indianapolis Racers were a major league ice hockey team that played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1974 to 1978. They competed in four full seasons before folding 25 games into the 1978–79 season. They played at Market Square Arena. They were the first professional team to secure Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier.

The Racers were known in the WHA for their sometimes-fanatical fans. The franchise led the WHA in attendance for the 1976–77 season. The Racers won the 1975–76 WHA Eastern Division championship and swept the rival Cincinnati Stingers in the 1977 WHA playoffs. Notable players for the Racers include Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier, Pat Stapleton, Dave Keon, Michel Dion and Kim Clackson. The Racers&#x27; best-known coach, Jacques Demers, later led the Montreal Canadiens to the 1992–93 Stanley Cup championship.
==Demise==
At the time of the Racers&#x27; founding, the only other major league competitor was the Indiana Pacers of the similarly-upstart American Basketball Association (ABA). As merger and expansion discussions heated up in both established leagues, the question of Indianapolis&#x27; inclusion proved a complicated one. Both the NBA and the NHL believed Indianapolis was far too small to support teams in both sports in the long term, and were reluctant to risk the embarrassment of placing a failed franchise there. For this reason among others, the Pacers were seen for a long time to have a slim chance to be included in the eventual ABA-NBA merger. Nevertheless, to the surprise of many sports fans and pundits of the time the Pacers were ultimately included in the merger, so that starting in 1976, the WHA would have to compete with the established NBA in Indiana. While the Racers continued to attract strong fan support for awhile, this turned out to be the beginning of the end for the team.

The Racers&#x27; demise came under the stewardship of Nelson Skalbania, a flamboyant Canadian real estate businessman. Skalbania, who regularly flipped real estate property and sports franchises for a profit, was repeatedly accused of mismanaging the promising Indianapolis hockey market and plotting to move the franchise to Canada, where it would presumably have had a much better chance of being included in an eventual merger the WHA was negotiating with the National Hockey League (NHL). Having taken the firm position that no surviving Canadian WHA teams would be excluded from a merger, and knowing the NHL was barely willing to even consider taking in a small number of WHA teams, the WHA was not willing to risk upsetting delicate merger negotiations and rebuffed all proposals to add more teams in Canada.

Unable to move his team, Skalbania looked elsewhere to gain leverage in the ongoing merger discussions. He turned to underage players – the NHL had stringent rules regarding the age of players they could sign while the WHA regularly signed underage players. Skalbania&#x27;s best-known signing was that of 17-year-old future superstar Wayne Gretzky, who signed a personal services contract worth between $1.125 and $1.75 million over four to seven years – at the time, one of the largest contracts ever offered a hockey player. The move did not improve the team&#x27;s desperate financial situation, and just eight games into the 1978–79 season Skalbania liquidated his greatest asset to his old friend and former (and future) business partner, Peter Pocklington, owner of the Edmonton Oilers. Pocklington purchased Gretzky and two other Indianapolis players, goaltender Eddie Mio and forward Peter Driscoll, paying a reported $700,000 for the contracts of the three players, although the announced price was $850,000. The Racers folded 17 games later on December 15, 1978, ending major league hockey in Indianapolis.

The other six WHA teams finished the season, and before the Winnipeg Jets won the 1979 Avco World Trophy, the league accepted the terms of a merger with the NHL whereby Edmonton, Winnipeg, Quebec, and New England would enter the NHL as &quot;expansion teams&quot; the following season and the WHA itself would cease operations. Cincinnati and Birmingham, the other surviving WHA teams, were paid to disband.

==Legacy==
Mark Messier also began his career with the Racers in the 1978–79 season, playing five games but failing to register a point before finishing his tryout contract. He was picked up later by Cincinnati for the remainder of the season, before being selected by the Oilers in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. Messier retired in 2004 as the last active player to have played in the WHA, and also the last active player to have played for the Racers.

Skalbania himself would ultimately become an NHL owner a year after the merger when he fronted a Calgary-based ownership group that purchased the Atlanta Flames and moved them north, where they became the Calgary Flames.

<text>Fournofarago () is a small village located in southern Crete, Greece.

==History==
The first families arrived to the village from an old village named Katalimata. That old village is no longer standing, yet some ruins can be found in the mountain near Fournofarago.

==Features==
The village is known for its celebratory feast of Aghios Georgios held annually on April 23 and a chapel fountain with reported healing powers. Many people journey to the fountain in order to return to their homes with the clear-tasting water. The chapel itself grants a good view of the whole region.

==Geography==
Located in the municipal unit of Kofinas, it is about 7 miles (11 km) from Asimi, it has been in existence since at least 1842.

Nearby villages are Stavies, Vagionia and Loukia.

The village lies on the foothills of a mountain, which is home of various animals (hares and weasels, to name a few ) and also provides food for the various flocks of sheep, goats and cows owned by the villagers.

<doc id="795280" wikidata="Q843235" url="?curid=795280" title="Biblical Aramaic">
<text>Biblical Aramaic is the form of Aramaic that is used in the books of Daniel and Ezra in the Hebrew Bible. It should not be confused with the Targums – Aramaic paraphrases, explanations and expansions of the Hebrew scriptures.

==History==
During the Babylonian captivity of the Jews, which began around 600 BC, the language spoken by the Jews started to change from Hebrew to Aramaic, and Aramaic square script replaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. After the Achaemenid Empire annexed the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, Aramaic became the main language of public life and administration. Darius the Great declared Imperial Aramaic to be the official language of the western half of his empire in 500 BC, and it is that Imperial Aramaic that forms the basis of Biblical Aramaic.

Biblical Hebrew was gradually reduced to the status of a liturgical language and a language of theological learning, and the Jews of the Second Temple period that started in 516 BC would have spoken a western form of Old Aramaic until their partial Hellenization from the 3rd century BC and the eventual emergence of Middle Aramaic in the 3rd century BC.

As Imperial Aramaic had served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; throughout the Ancient Near East from the second half of the 8th century BC to the end of the 4th century BC, linguistic contact with even the oldest stages of Biblical Hebrew, the main language of the Hebrew Bible, is easily accounted for.

Biblical Aramaic&#x27;s relative chronology has been debated mostly in the context of dating the Book of Daniel. In 1929, Harold Rowley argued that its origin must be later than the 6th century BC and that the language was more similar to the targums than to the Imperial Aramaic documents available at his time.

Others have argued that the language most closely resembles the 5th-century BC Elephantine papyri, and so is a good representative of typical Imperial Aramaic, including Jongtae Choi&#x27;s doctoral dissertation at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. Kenneth Kitchen takes an agnostic position and states that the Aramaic of the Book of Daniel is compatible with any period from the 5th to early 2nd century BC.

==Aramaic and Hebrew==
Biblical Hebrew is the main language of the Hebrew Bible. Aramaic accounts for only 269 verses out of a total of over 23,000. Biblical Aramaic is closely related to Hebrew, as both are in the Northwest Semitic language family. Some obvious similarities and differences are listed below:

===Similarities===
Hebrew and Aramaic have simplified the inflections of the noun, adjective and verb. These are more highly inflected in classical Arabic, Babylonian and Ugaritic.

===Differences===
* The definite article is a suffixed -ā (א) in Aramaic (an emphatic or determined state), but a prefixed h- (ה) in Hebrew.
* Aramaic is not a Canaanite language and so did not experience the Canaanite vowel shift from *&quot;ā&quot; to &quot;ō&quot;.
* In Aramaic, the preposition dalet functions as a conjunction and is often used instead of the construct to indicate the genitive/possessive relationship.

===Sound changes===
==In the Hebrew Bible==

=== Undisputed occurrences ===
* Genesis 31:47appearance of an Aramaic placename, Jegar-Sahadutha (יגר שהדותא &quot;Yəḡar-śāhăḏūṯā&quot;), which is glossed in Hebrew as גלעד (&quot;Gal‘êḏ&quot;, &quot;mound of witness.&quot;)
* Proverbs 31:2 the Aramaic word &quot;bar&quot; (בר) is used instead of the usual Hebrew &quot;ben&quot; (בן), both meaning &quot;son.&quot;
* Jeremiah 10:11a single sentence denouncing idolatry occurs in the middle of a Hebrew text. (כדנה תאמרון להום אלהיא די שמיא וארקא לא עבדו יאבדו מארעא ומן תחות שמיא אלה &quot;Kiḏnāh têmərūn ləhōm ’ĕlāhayyā, dî-šəmayyā wə-’arqā lā ‘ăḇaḏū yêḇaḏū mê-’ar‘ā ū-min təḥōṯ šəmayyā ’êlleh.&quot;; &quot;Thus shall ye say unto them, &#x27;The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.&#x27;&quot;)
* Daniel 2:4b–7:28five stories about Daniel and his colleagues, and an apocalyptic vision.
* Ezra 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26quotations of documents from the 5th century BCE on the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem.

===Other suggested occurrences===
* Genesis 15:1the word במחזה (&quot;ba-maħaze&quot;, &quot;in a vision&quot;). According to the Zohar (I:88b), the word is Aramaic, as the usual Hebrew word would be (&quot;ba-mar’e&quot;).
* Numbers 23:10the word רבע (&quot;rôḇa‘&quot;, usually translated as &quot;stock&quot; or &quot;fourth part&quot;). Joseph H. Hertz, in his commentary on this verse, cites Friedrich Delitzsch&#x27;s claim (cited in William F. Albright&#x27; JBL 63 (1944), p. 213, n.28) that it is an Aramaic word meaning &quot;dust&quot;.
* Job 36:2a (כתר־לי זעיר ואחוך &quot;Kattar-lî zə‘êr wa-’ăḥawwekā&quot;, &quot;Wait for me a little, and I will show you...&quot;)Rashi, in his commentary on the verse, states that the phrase is in Aramaic.
* Psalm 2:12the word בר (&quot;bar&quot;) is interpreted by some Christian sources (including the King James Version) to be the Aramaic word for &quot;son&quot; and renders the phrase נשקו-בר (&quot;nashəqū-bar&quot;) as &quot;kiss the Son,&quot; a reference to Jesus. Jewish sources and some Christian sources (including Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate) follow the Hebrew reading of (&quot;purity&quot;) and translate the phrase as &quot;embrace purity.&quot; See Psalm 2 for further discussion of the controversy.

==Chaldean misnomer==

For many centuries, from at least the time of Jerome of Stridon (d. 420), Biblical Aramaic was misnamed as &quot;Chaldean&quot; (Chaldaic, Chaldee). That label remained common in early Aramaic studies, and persisted up to the nineteenth century. The &quot;Chaldean&quot; misnomer was consequently abandoned, when further research showed conclusively that the Aramaic dialect used in the Hebrew Bible was not related to the ancient Chaldeans and their language.

<text>Manfredo Fanti (23 February 1806 – 5 April 1865) was an Italian general; he is known as the founder of the Royal Italian Army.

==Biography==
Manfredo Fanti was born at Carpi (Emilia-Romagna) and educated at the military college of Modena.

In 1831 he was implicated in the revolutionary movement organized by Ciro Menotti, and was condemned to death and hanged in effigy, but escaped to France, where he was given an appointment in the French corps of engineers. In 1833 he took part in Mazzini&#x27;s abortive attempt to invade Savoy, and in 1835 he went to Spain to serve in Queen Christina&#x27;s army against the Carlists. There he remained for thirteen years, distinguishing himself in battle and rising to a high staff appointment.

But on the outbreak of the war between Piedmont and Austria in 1848 he hurried back to Italy, and although at first his services were rejected both by the Piedmontese government and the Lombard provisional government, he was afterwards given the command of a Lombard brigade. In the general confusion following on Charles Albert&#x27;s defeat on the Mincio and his retreat to Milan, where the people rose against the unhappy king, Fanti&#x27;s courage and tact saved the situation. He was elected member of the Piedmontese Chamber of Deputies in 1849, and on the renewal of the campaign he again commanded a Lombard brigade under General Girolamo Ramorino.

After the Piedmontese defeat at Novara (23 March) peace was made, but a rising broke out at Genoa, and Fanti with great difficulty restrained his Lombards from taking part in it. But he was suspected as a Mazzinian and a soldier of fortune by the higher Piedmontese officers, and they insisted on his being courtmartialled for his operations under Ramorino (who had been tried and shot). Although honorably acquitted, he was not employed again until the Crimean expedition of 1855.

In the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, Fanti commanded the 2nd Division, and contributed to the victories of Palestro, Magenta and Solferino. After the Armistice of Villafranca he was sent to organize the army of the United Provinces of Central Italy (composed of the provisional governments of Tuscany, Modena, Parma and Romagna), and converted it in a few months into a well-drilled body of 45,000 men, whose function was to be ready to intervene in the Papal States on the outbreak of a revolution.

He showed statesmanlike qualities in steering a clear course between the exaggerated prudence of Bettino Ricasoli, who wished to recall the troops from the frontier, and the impetuosity of Giuseppe Garibaldi, his second-in-command, who was anxious to attack Rome prematurely, even at the risk of Austrian intervention. Fanti&#x27;s firmness led to Garibaldi&#x27;s resignation. In January 1860 Fanti became minister of war and marine under Cavour, and incorporated the League&#x27;s army in that of Piedmont. He began to implement reforms to the army (which had grown from five to thirteen divisions), which led to clashes with Alfonso La Marmora, whose concepts he had overturned with his reforms.

In the meanwhile Garibaldi had invaded Sicily with his Redshirts, and King Victor Emmanuel II decided at last that he too must intervene.

Fanti was given command of a force of two army corps which invaded the Papal States, seized Ancona and other fortresses, and defeated the Papal army at Castelfidardo, where the enemy&#x27;s commander, General Lamoricière, was captured. In three weeks Fanti had conquered the Marche and Umbria and taken 28,000 prisoners. When the army entered Neapolitan territory, the king took the chief command, with Fanti as chief of the staff.

After defeating a large Neapolitan force at Mola and organizing the siege operations around Gaeta, Fanti returned to the war office at Turin to further carry out reforms. He was instrumental in opposing Garibaldi&#x27;s wishes to keep alive his volunteer-based army, with the backing of Prime Minister Cavour, and despite the early support of the king towards Garibaldi&#x27;s ideas; in the end, the so-called &quot;Esercito Meridionale&quot; was disbanded, and of the 7000 officers only as few as 1700 were incorporated in the newly created, conscription-based Royal Italian Army, despite Garibaldi&#x27;s urgings to the contrary, which led to several clashes in parliament. At the same time, Fanti looked with more favour to the admission of several officers of the defunct Army of the Two Sicilies. His harsh liquidation of Garibaldi&#x27;s forces led to him being severely criticised by the parties of the Left.

When Cavour died, on 7 June 1861, Fanti resigned, and was no more actively involved in the Italian Army; his reforms were largely reversed by successive ministries of war leaning towards General La Marmora, despite his urgings to the contrary. However, his health was in decline, and he ultimately died in Florence on 5 April 1865.

<text>М-200 &quot;Месть&quot; (&quot;Myest&quot;, meaning &quot;vengeance&quot; or &quot;revenge&quot;) was a Malyutka class (Serie XV) short-range, diesel attack submarine of the Soviet Navy.

== World War Two ==
Operating in the Northern Fleet, the submarine attempted one attack on 20 July 1944 against a German convoy but was spotted by a German aircraft and received a subsequent attack with depth charges. On 15 July 1944 M-200 launched two torpedoes against a merchant, missing the target.

== Cold War ==
On 21 November 1956 while returning to port after transit to Paldiski near Tallinn, &quot;Myest&quot; was to rendezvous with the destroyer &quot;Statny&quot;. At about 19:45 hours, after spotting the destroyer, the boat&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Second Rank Yuri Pavlovich Shtikov, gave the conn to Captain Third Rank Shumanin, and went below for supper. Shumanin had previous experience in Shch-type (щука, shchuka, &quot;pike&quot;) and С-type (средняя, srednyaja, &quot;medium&quot;) boats, but was new to М-type (малая, Malaya, &quot;small&quot;) boats such as M-200.

At 19:53 hours, while attempting to take station alongside the destroyer, the submarine cut across the destroyer&#x27;s bow, which struck the boat on the starboard side aft, flooding the two after compartments immediately and killing the six men stationed there. Eight men escaped in the six or eight minutes before the boat sank, but two of them drowned before they could be rescued. Twenty-eight survivors were trapped in the compartments one, three, and four of the sunken submarine.

The submarine&#x27;s emergency buoy was located at 21:05 hours, and communications were established with the remaining survivors in compartment one, the forward torpedo room. The men in compartments three and four had already died. Rescue forces began quickly arriving at the accident&#x27;s scene, but were unable to provide air to the survivors.

By 04:00 hours the next morning, 22 November, the men in the submarine were prepared to use their escape equipment to leave the wreck, but were ordered to remain aboard while the senior officers on the surface developed plans to lift the boat with a floating crane. Numerous meetings occupied those officers until about 18:00 hours that evening, when the rescue attempt actually began. However, the weather had deteriorated, and when the rescue vessels began to drag anchor and the telephone cable to the sunken wreck parted, the attempt was abandoned.

At 03:47 hours the next morning, 23 November, divers located the wreck, and learned that the previous evening, after the telephone line parted and communications were lost, the survivors had decided to disobey orders, and escape on their own. However, the first man to use the escape hatch had died in the attempt, blocking the hatch for the rest. Killing them all, the submarine was never raised.

<text>Digenea (Gr. &quot;Dis&quot; – double, &quot;Genos&quot; – race) is a class of trematodes in the Platyhelminthes phylum, consisting of parasitic flatworms (known as &quot;flukes&quot;) with a syncytial tegument and, usually, two suckers, one ventral and one oral. Adults commonly live within the digestive tract, but occur throughout the organ systems of all classes of vertebrates. Once thought to be related to the Monogenea, it is now recognised that they are closest to the Aspidogastrea and that the Monogenea are more closely allied with the Cestoda. Around 6,000 species have been described to date.

==Morphology==
===Key features===
Characteristic features of the Digenea include a syncytial tegument; that is, a tegument where the junctions between cells are broken down and a single continuous cytoplasm surrounds the entire animal. A similar tegument is found in other members of the Neodermata; a group of platyhelminths comprising the Digenea, Aspidogastrea, Monogenea and Cestoda. Digeneans possess a vermiform, unsegmented body-plan and have a solid parenchyma with no body cavity (coelom) as in all platyhelminths.
There are typically two suckers, an anterior sucker surrounding the mouth, and a ventral sucker sometimes termed the acetabulum, on the ventral surface. The oral sucker surrounds the mouth, while the ventral sucker is a blind muscular organ with no connection to any internal structure.

A &quot;monostome&quot; is a worm with one sucker (oral). Flukes with an oral sucker and an acetabulum at the posterior end of the body are called &quot;Amphistomes&quot;. &quot;Distomes&quot; are flukes with an oral sucker and a ventral sucker, but the ventral sucker is somewhere other than posterior. These terms are common in older literature, when they were thought to reflect systematic relationships within the groups. They have fallen out of use in modern digenean taxonomy.

===Reproductive system===
The vast majority of digeneans are hermaphrodites. This is likely to be an adaptation to low abundance within hosts, allowing the life cycle to continue when only one individual successfully infects the final host. Fertilisation is internal, with sperm being transferred via the cirrus to the Laurer&#x27;s Canal or genital aperture. A key group of digeneans which are dioecious are the schistosomes.
Asexual reproduction in the first larval stage is ubiquitous.

While the sexual formation of the digenean eggs and asexual reproduction in the first larval stage (miracidium) is widely reported, the developmental biology of the asexual stages remains a problem. Electron microscopic studies have shown that the light microscopically visible germ balls consist of mitotically dividing cells which give rise to embryos and to a line of new germ cells that become included in these embryonic stages. Since the absence of meiotic processes is not proven, the exact definition remains doubtful.

====Male organs====
Protandry is the general rule among the Digenea. Usually two testes are present, but some flukes can have more than 100. Also present are vasa efferentia, a vas deferens, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory duct and a cirrus (analogous to a penis) usually (but not always) enclosed in a cirrus sac. The cirrus may or may not be covered in proteinaceous spines. The exact conformation of these organs within the male terminal genitalia is taxonomically important at the familial and generic levels.

====Female organs====
Usually there is a single ovary with an oviduct, a seminal receptacle, a pair of vitelline glands (involved in yolk and egg-shell production) with ducts, the ootype (a chamber where eggs are formed), a complex collection of glands cells called &quot;Mehlis’ gland&quot;, which is believed to lubricate the uterus for egg passage.

In addition, some digeneans possess a canal called Laurer&#x27;s Canal, which leads from the oviduct to the dorsal surface of the body. The function of this canal is debated, but it may be used for insemination in some species or for disposal of waste products from reproduction in other species.
Most trematodes possess an ovicapt, an enlarged portion of the oviduct where it joins the ovary. It probably controls the release of ova and spaces out their descent down the uterus.

The uterus typically opens into a common genital atrium that also received the distal male copulatory organ (cirrus) before immediately opening onto the outer surface of the worm. The distal part of the uterus may be expanded into a metraterm, set off from the proximal uterus by a muscular sphincter, or it may be lined with spines, as in the Monorchiidae and some other families.

===Digestive system===
As adults, most digeneans possess a terminal or subterminal mouth, a muscular pharynx that provides the force for ingesting food, and a forked, blind digestive system consisting of two tubular sacs called caeca (sing. caecum). In some species the two gut caeca join posteriorly to make a ring-shaped gut or cyclocoel. In others the caeca may fuse with the body wall posteriorly to make one or more anuses, or with the excretory vesicle to form a uroproct. Digeneans are also capable of direct nutrient uptake through the tegument by pinocytosis and phagocytosis by the syncitium. Most adult digeneans occur in the vertebrate alimentary canal or its associated organs, where they most often graze on contents of the lumen (e.g., food ingested by the host, bile, mucus), but they may also feed across the mucosal wall (e.g., submucosa, host blood). The blood flukes, such as schistosomes, spirorchiids and sanguinicolids, feed exclusively on blood. Asexual stages in mollusc intermediate hosts feed mostly by direct absorption, although the redia stage found in some groups does have a mouth, pharynx and simple gut and may actively consume host tissue or even other parasites. Encysted metacercarial stages and free-living cercarial stages do not feed.

===Nervous system===
Paired ganglia at the anterior end of the body serve as the brain. From this nerves extend anteriorly and posteriorly. Sensory receptors are, for the most part, lacking among the adults, although they do have tangoreceptor cells. Larval stages have many kinds of sensory receptors, including light receptors and chemoreceptors. Chemoreception plays an important role in the free-living miracidial larva recognising and locating its host.

==Life cycles==
There is a bewildering array of variation on the complex digenean life cycle, and plasticity in this trait is probably a key to the group&#x27;s success. In general, the life cycles may have two, three, or four obligate (necessary) hosts, sometimes with transport or paratenic hosts in between. The three-host life cycle is probably the most common. In almost all species, the first host in the life cycle is a mollusc. This has led to the inference that the ancestral digenean was a mollusc parasite and that vertebrate hosts were added subsequently.

The alternation of sexual and asexual generations is an important feature of digeneans. This phenomenon involves the presence of several discrete generations in one life-cycle.

A typical digenean trematode life cycle is as follows. Eggs leave the vertebrate host in faeces and use various strategies to infect the first intermediate host, in which sexual reproduction does not occur. Digeneans may infect the first intermediate host (usually a snail) by either passive or active means. The eggs of some digeneans, for example, are (passively) eaten by snails (or, rarely, by an annelid worm), in which they proceed to hatch. Alternatively, eggs may hatch in water to release an actively swimming, ciliated larva, the miracidium, which must locate and penetrate the body wall of the snail host.

After post-ingestion hatching or penetration of the snail, the miracidium metamorphoses into a simple, sac-like &quot;mother sporocyst&quot;. The mother sporocyst undergoes a round of internal asexual reproduction, giving rise to either &quot;rediae&quot; (sing. redia) or &quot;daughter sporocysts&quot;. The second generation is thus the daughter parthenita sequence. These in turn undergo further asexual reproduction, ultimately yielding large numbers of the second free-living stage, the &quot;cercaria&quot; (pl. cercariae).

Free-swimming cercariae leave the snail host and move through the aquatic or marine environment, often using a whip-like tail, though a tremendous diversity of tail morphology is seen. Cercariae are infective to the second host in the life cycle, and infection may occur passively (e.g., a fish consumes a cercaria) or actively (the cercaria penetrates the fish).

The life cycles of some digeneans include only two hosts, the second being a vertebrate. In these groups, sexual maturity occurs after the cercaria penetrates the second host, which is in this case also the definitive host. Two-host life cycles can be primary (there never was a third host) as in the Bivesiculidae, or secondary (there was at one time in evolutionary history a third host but it has been lost).

In three-host life cycles, cercariae develop in the second intermediate host into a resting stage, the &quot;metacercaria&quot;, which is usually encysted in a cyst of host and parasite origin, or encapsulated in a layer of tissue derived from the host only. This stage is infective to the definitive host. Transmission occurs when the definitive host preys upon an infected second intermediate host. Metacercariae excyst in the definitive host&#x27;s gut in response to a variety of physical and chemical signals, such as gut pH levels, digestive enzymes, temperature, etc. Once excysted, adult digeneans migrate to more or less specific sites in the definitive host and the life cycle repeats.

==Evolution==
The evolutionary origins of the Digenea have been debated for some time, but there appears general agreement that the proto-digenean was a parasite of a mollusc, possibly of the mantle cavity. Evidence for this comes from the ubiquity of molluscs as first intermediate hosts for digeneans, and the fact that most aspidogastreans (the sister group to the Digenea) also have mollusc associations. It is thought that the early trematodes (the collective name for digeneans and aspidogastreans) likely evolved from rhabdocoel turbellarians that colonised the open mantle cavity of early molluscs.

It is likely that more complex life cycles evolved through a process of terminal addition, whereby digeneans survived predation of their mollusc host, probably by a fish. Other hosts were added by the same process until the modern bewildering diversity of life cycle patterns developed.

==Human digenean infections==
Only about 12 of the 6,000 known species are infectious to humans, but some of these species are important diseases afflicting over 200 million people. The species that infect humans can be divided into groups, the schistosomes and the non-schistosomes.

===Schistosomes===
The Schistosomes occur in the circulatory system of the definitive host. Humans become infected after free-swimming cercaria liberated from infected snails penetrate the skin. These dioecious worms are long and thin, ranging in size from 10 to 30 mm in length to 0.2 to 1.0 mm in diameter. Adult males are shorter and thicker than females, and have a long groove along one side of the body in which the female is clasped. Females reach sexual maturity after they have been united with a male. After mating the two remain locked together for the rest of their lives. They can live for several years and produce many thousands of eggs.

The four species of schistosomes that infect humans are members of the genus &quot;Schistosoma&quot;.

===Non-schistosomes===

The seven major species of non-schistosomes that infect humans are listed below. People become infected after ingesting metacercarial cysts on plants or in undercooked animal flesh. Most species inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract, where they shed eggs along with host feces. &quot;Paragonimus westermani&quot;, which colonizes the lungs, can also pass its eggs in saliva. These flukes generally cause mild pathology in humans, but more serious effects may also occur.

<text>Yu Shan or Yushan, also known as Mount Jade, Jade Mountain, Tongku Saveq or Mount Niitaka during Japanese rule, is the highest mountain in Taiwan at above sea level, giving Taiwan the 4th-highest maximum elevation of any island in the world. It is the highest point in the western Pacific region outside of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Yushan and its surrounding mountains belong to the Yushan Range. The area was once in the ocean; it rose to its current height because of the Eurasian Plate&#x27;s movement over the Philippine Sea Plate. Yushan is ranked 40th by topographic isolation.

The mountains are now protected as the Yushan National Park. The national park is Taiwan&#x27;s largest, highest, and least accessible national park. It contains the largest tract of wilderness remaining on the island. 

==Names==
Yushan or Yu Shan is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese name It is also known as , , and , calques of the same name. The name derives from its appearance in the winter, when its thick snow cover is thought to make its peak look like stainless jade. &quot;Yushan&quot; or Jade Mountain was also the name of a location in ancient Chinese mythology, a paradise said to be the home of the Queen Mother of the West.

During the Qing Dynasty, Yushan was known in Chinese as Mugangshan (&quot;Wooded Mountain&quot;) from its surrounding forests. Other Chinese names included Batongguan, transcribing its native Tsou name &quot;Patungkuonʉ&quot;; Baiyushan (&quot;White Jade Mountain&quot;); and Xueshan (&quot;Snowy Mountain&quot;). It was previously known in English as a name sometimes mistakenly thought to honor the missionary Robert Morrison, but simply the name of an American captain who sighted it.

Other native names for the mountain include Saviah and Tongku Saveq (Bunun; the latter means &quot;highest peak&quot; or &quot;sheltering peak&quot;), Tanungu&#x27;incu (Kanakanavu), and Kanasian (Paiwan).

During Japan&#x27;s rule in Taiwan, the mountain became known as or Niitakayama (&quot;New High Mountain&quot;) because new surveying showed that it was higher than in the Japanese archipelago.

==Geography and geology==
The island of Taiwan is situated at the intersection of two tectonic plates – the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. Even as “recently” as the late Paleozoic (some 250 million years ago), the land here was still but a sedimentary seabed layered with silt and sand. As the two plates began pressing against each other, the land buckled, bent, and created the landscape – 165 mountains higher than above sea level on a relatively small island (38th largest in the world).

Yushan is also notable in containing the highest point on the Tropic of Cancer and the only point on that circle of latitude where there is any evidence of Quaternary glaciation. As recently as seventeen thousand years ago, permanent ice caps existed throughout Taiwan&#x27;s highest mountains and extended owing to the wet climate down to ; whereas currently, the nearest glaciers to the Tropic of Cancer are in Mexico on the Iztaccíhuatl volcano.

The ocean waters off Taiwan&#x27;s east coast are deep; in fact, submarine slopes plunge down to the Pacific Ocean at a grade of 1:10 and the ocean reaches a depth of more than about from the coast.

==Hiking==
With panoramic views, overlapping mountains, and deep, plunging valleys, Yushan National Park is well known for its scenery, sunrises, sunsets, geological features, and views of the clouds from above. Sea of clouds often fill the valleys. Yushan itself is the focal point of the park.

Yushan is one of the favorites among Taiwanese mountain climbers. For international peak baggers, Yushan is ranked as the 4th World Island Highpoints and the 3rd Asian Island Highpoints. Some hikers combine trips to Puncak Jaya () in Indonesia and Mount Kinabalu () in Malaysia to create an &quot;Asian Trilogy&quot;.

Yushan has five main peaks:
* Main Peak (玉山主峰), , the most popular of the peaks
* Eastern Peak (玉山東峰), – from Main Peak
* Northern Peak (玉山北峰), – from Fengkou (風口, &quot;Wind Tunnel&quot;)
* Southern Peak (玉山南峰), – from Paiyun Lodge (排雲山莊)
* Western Peak (玉山西峰), – from Paiyun Lodge

The east, west, north, and south peaks surround the main summit. The east peak rises to a height of and is considered one of Taiwan&#x27;s Ten Major Summits (十峻). The south peak is a sharp pinnacle of black shale. The relatively accessible west side of Yushan is covered with thick forests. The north peak is part of a long, gently-rising ridge; this peak consists of two high points that resemble a camel&#x27;s humps. The North Peak is also home to Taiwan&#x27;s highest permanently occupied building, the Yushan weather station, where visitors are sometimes welcomed.

== Flora and fauna ==

Taiwan, with the tropic of Cancer across the center of the island, has a climate between tropical and subtropical. The average temperature is . Here low elevation areas support evergreen broadleaved forests. As elevation increases, evergreen broadleaved forests are gradually replaced by deciduous forests and coniferous forests. At mountain peaks with alpine conditions, only mosses, liverworts and occasionally grasses can be found on the ground.

All of the above vegetation variations can be seen in the Yushan area from low foothills to high summits with an elevation difference of . Because of these wide climatic and vegetation variations, this environment nurtures the richest and most diversified wildlife in Taiwan. Preliminary investigations reveal that there are 130 species of birds, 28 species of mammals, 17 species of reptiles, 12 species of amphibians, and 186 species of butterflies in Yushan National Park. In fact, Yushan is nicknamed &quot;the ark&quot; by academics who see it as a repository of Taiwan&#x27;s rare species. It is almost an encyclopedia of Taiwan&#x27;s ecological systems, a geological museum and an important habitat of one-third of Taiwan&#x27;s endemic species, such as:
* Formosan serow (台灣長鬃山羊)
* Reeves&#x27;s muntjac (台灣山羌)
* Formosan black bear (台灣黑熊)
* Formosan blue magpie (台灣藍鵲)
* Formosan rock macaque (台灣獼猴)
* &quot;Hemimyzon taitungensis&quot; (台東間爬岩鰍) and &quot;Varicorhinus tamusuiensis&quot; (Oshima) – Two unique fish species living in the Lekuleku River area.

==History==
Under the Qing Dynasty, W. Morrison, captain of the American steam freighter &quot;Alexander&quot;, sighted the mountain while departing from Anping Harbor (present-day Anping, Tainan) in 1857. His log was the first western mention of the mountain, which took his name in European accounts. European mountaineers couldn&#x27;t access the mountain at the time due to hostile relations of local aborigines to both Qing authorities and Europeans.

Under the Japanese, the anthropologists Torii Ryūzō and Ushinosuke Mori became the first people recorded to summit the mountain in 1900. They gave it the name which was used as the name of the Niitaka Arisan National Park in 1937. The Imperial Japanese Navy also used the mountain&#x27;s name in its &quot;Go&quot; signal&quot;NIITAKAYAMANOBORE 1208 ( [Kanji: ])&quot;, meaning &quot;Climb Mount Niitaka 1208&quot;to begin the surprise attack against the USN Pacific Fleet and its base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 December 1941 (8 December [1208] in Japanese calendar). 

The Yushan weather station on the north peak was finished in 1943.

Under the Republic of China, a large bronze statue of Yu Youren was placed on the Yushan summit in 1966. The statue was cut down and thrown into a ravine by activists for Taiwan independence in 1996.

In recent years, Yushan has played an important role in a new focus on Taiwan&#x27;s identity. Because of its iconic status, Yushan has been chosen to be the background of the newly-issued NT$1,000 notes on 20 July 2005. Similarly, an asteroid discovered by National Central University&#x27;s Lulin Observatory on 28 December 2007 was named &quot;&quot; in honor of the mountain.

==Climate==
Yushan has an alpine climate (Köppen &quot;ET/ETf&quot;). The tip of Yushan is usually covered with frost from November to March. Elevations above may sometimes see snow during the winter months, and there are four consecutive months of snow accumulation at places with elevations higher than . The first snow may appear in October and completely melts by May. Snow falls 24.3 days per year on average on Yushan, and the number is gradually decreasing.
Yushan receives around of precipitation annually. It rains an average of 140 days per year, with the greatest frequency between May and August. From May until the first part of June is plum rain season or monsoon season. Taiwan&#x27;s typhoon season roughly falls between July and September. The peak month is in August, which sees of precipitation on average, compared to in December, the driest month.

<text>The &#x27; in Berlin, Germany, is one of the leading universities of music in Europe. It was established in East Berlin in 1950 as the &#x27; () because the older (now the Berlin University of the Arts) was in West Berlin. After the death in 1962 of one of its first professors, composer Hanns Eisler, the school was renamed in his honor in 1964. After a renovation in 2005, the university is located in both Berlin&#x27;s famed and the .

The has a variety of ensembles including chamber music, choirs, orchestras and jazz.

==The Hochschule==

The Hochschule is structured in four divisions and four institutes. It offers programs in accordion, composition, conducting, coaching, drums, guitar, harmony and counterpoint, harp, jazz, music theatre, opera direction, strings, timpani, piano and wind instruments.
The 2002 founded Kurt-Singer-Institut specializes on research on health for musicians. Since 2003 the Institut für neue Musik deals with contemporary music. With the foundation of the Jazz-Institut Berlin in 2005, the conservatoire gained an international level in jazz education; David Friedman, John Hollenbeck, Judy Niemack and Jiggs Whigham are counted among the professors.

Every year, over 400 events are taking place – including concerts, opera productions, class recitals and exam concerts. The Hochschule collaborates with the Konzerthaus Berlin and the Berlin Philharmonic Foundation. In both these houses regular orchestral, choral and staff concerts are presented.

==History==
After the foundation of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), all music schools and the only music college in Berlin were situated in the west of Berlin. Hence the GDR Ministry for Education decided to establish a music college in the east sector. On 1 October 1950 the Deutsche Hochschule für Musik was founded. Professor Georg Knepler was the first director of the school. The teaching staff included Rudolph Wagner-Régeny and Hanns Eisler (composition), Helmut Koch (conducting), Helma Prechter, Arno Schellenberg (voice), Carl Adolf Martiensse, Grete Herwig (piano), Gustav Havemann, Wilhelm Martens (violin), Bernhard Günther (cello), Werner Buchholz (viola) and Ewald Koch (clarinet).
Since 1964 the conservatoire has been named Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler Berlin. In 1950 a special school for music was founded. The conservatory built up a partnership with the Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Schule.

In 1953 the program of opera and musical theatre stage direction was established, as two students were interested in this subject. Thus the conservatory became one of the first schools in Europe to have a program of that kind.
The state of Berlin following the 1990 German reunification took over the conservatory. Today it is under the jurisdiction of the Senate department of science, research and the arts.

<text>In materials science, a dislocation or Taylor&#x27;s dislocation is a linear crystallographic defect or irregularity within a crystal structure that contains an abrupt change in the arrangement of atoms. The movement of dislocations allow atoms to slide over each other at low stress levels and is known as &quot;glide&quot; or slip. The crystalline order is restored on either side of a &quot;glide dislocation&quot; but the atoms on one side have moved by one position. The crystalline order is not fully restored with a &quot;partial dislocation&quot;. A dislocation defines the boundary between &quot;slipped&quot; and &quot;unslipped&quot; regions of material and as a result, must either form a complete loop, intersect other dislocations or defects, or extend to the edges of the crystal. A dislocation can be characterised by the distance and direction of movement it causes to atoms which is defined by the Burgers vector. Plastic deformation of a material occurs by the creation and movement of many dislocations. The number and arrangement of dislocations influences many of the properties of materials.

The two primary types of dislocations are &quot;sessile&quot; dislocations which are immobile and &quot;glissile&quot; dislocations which are mobile. Examples of sessile dislocations are the &quot;stair-rod&quot; dislocation and the Lomer–Cottrell junction. The two main types of mobile dislocations are &quot;edge&quot; and &quot;screw &quot; dislocations.

Edge dislocations can be visualized as being caused by the termination of a plane of atoms in the middle of a crystal. In such a case, the surrounding planes are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side. This phenomenon is analogous to half of a piece of paper inserted into a stack of paper, where the defect in the stack is noticeable only at the edge of the half sheet.

The theory describing the elastic fields of the defects was originally developed by Vito Volterra in 1907. In 1934, Egon Orowan, Michael Polanyi and G. I. Taylor, proposed that the low stresses observed to produce plastic deformation compared to theoretical predictions at the time could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations.

== History ==

The theory describing the elastic fields of the defects was originally developed by Vito Volterra in 1907. The term &#x27;dislocation&#x27; referring to a defect on the atomic scale was coined by G. I. Taylor in 1934.

Prior to the 1930s, one of the enduring challenges of materials science was to explain plasticity in microscopic terms. A simplistic attempt to calculate the shear stress at which neighbouring atomic planes &quot;slip&quot; over each other in a perfect crystal suggests that, for a material with shear modulus formula_1, shear strength formula_2 is given approximately by:

::formula_3

The shear modulus in metals is typically within the range 20 000 to 150 000 MPa indicating a predicted shear stress of 3 000 to 24 000 MPa. This was difficult to reconcile with measured shear stresses in the range of 0.5 to 10 MPa.

In 1934, Egon Orowan, Michael Polanyi and G. I. Taylor, independently proposed that plastic deformation could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations. Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge. In effect, a half plane of atoms is moved in response to shear stress by breaking and reforming a line of bonds, one (or a few) at a time. The energy required to break a row of bonds is far less than that required to break all the bonds on an entire plane of atoms at once. Even this simple model of the force required to move a dislocation shows that plasticity is possible at much lower stresses than in a perfect crystal. In many materials, particularly ductile materials, dislocations are the &quot;carrier&quot; of plastic deformation, and the energy required to move them is less than the energy required to fracture the material.

== Mechanisms ==
A dislocation is a linear crystallographic defect or irregularity within a crystal structure which contains an abrupt change in the arrangement of atoms. The crystalline order is restored on either side of a dislocation but the atoms on one side have moved or slipped. Dislocations define the boundary between slipped and unslipped regions of material and cannot end within a lattice and must either extend to a free edge or form a loop within the crystal. A dislocation can be characterised by a vector comprising the distance and direction of relative movement it causes to atoms as it moves through the lattice. This characterising vector is called the Burgers vector and remains constant even though the shape of the dislocation may change or deform.

A variety of dislocation types exist, with mobile dislocations known as &quot;glissile&quot; and immobile dislocations called &quot;sessile&quot;. The movement of mobile dislocations allow atoms to slide over each other at low stress levels and is known as glide or slip. The movement of dislocations may be enhanced or hindered by the presence of other elements within the crystal and over time, these elements may diffuse to the dislocation forming a Cottrell atmosphere. The pinning and breakaway from these elements explains some of the unusual yielding behavior seen with steels. The interaction of hydrogen with dislocations is one of the mechanisms proposed to explain hydrogen embrittlement.

Dislocations behave as though they are a distinct entity within a crystalline material where some types of dislocation can move through the material bending, flexing and changing shape and interacting with other dislocations and features within the crystal. Dislocations are generated by deforming a crystalline material such as metals, which can cause them to initiate from surfaces, particularly at stress concentrations or within the material at defects and grain boundaries. The number and arrangement of dislocations give rise to many of the properties of metals such as ductility, hardness and yield strength. Heat treatment, alloy content and cold working can change the number and arrangement of the dislocation population and how they move and interact in order to create useful properties.

=== Generating dislocations ===
When metals are subjected to cold working (deformation at temperatures which are relatively low as compared to the material&#x27;s absolute melting temperature, formula_4 i.e., typically less than formula_5) the dislocation density increases due to the formation of new dislocations. The consequent increasing overlap between the strain fields of adjacent dislocations gradually increases the resistance to further dislocation motion. This causes a hardening of the metal as deformation progresses. This effect is known as strain hardening or work hardening.

Dislocation density formula_6 in a material can be increased by plastic deformation by the following relationship:

::formula_7.

Since the dislocation density increases with plastic deformation, a mechanism for the creation of dislocations must be activated in the material. Three mechanisms for dislocation formation are homogeneous nucleation, grain boundary initiation, and interfaces between the lattice and the surface, precipitates, dispersed phases, or reinforcing fibers.

==== Homogeneous nucleation ====
The creation of a dislocation by &quot;homogeneous nucleation&quot; is a result of the rupture of the atomic bonds along a line in the lattice. A plane in the lattice is sheared, resulting in 2 oppositely faced half planes or dislocations. These dislocations move away from each other through the lattice. Since homogeneous nucleation forms dislocations from perfect crystals and requires the simultaneous breaking of many bonds, the energy required for homogeneous nucleation is high. For instance, the stress required for homogeneous nucleation in copper has been shown to be formula_8, where formula_1 is the shear modulus of copper (46 GPa). Solving for formula_10, we see that the required stress is 3.4 GPa, which is very close to the theoretical strength of the crystal. Therefore, in conventional deformation homogeneous nucleation requires a concentrated stress, and is very unlikely. Grain boundary initiation and interface interaction are more common sources of dislocations.

Irregularities at the grain boundaries in materials can produce dislocations which propagate into the grain. The steps and ledges at the grain boundary are an important source of dislocations in the early stages of plastic deformation.

==== Frank–Read source ====
The Frank–Read source is a mechanism that is able to produce a stream of dislocations from a pinned segment of a dislocation. Stress bows the dislocation segment, expanding until it creates a dislocation loop that breaks free from the source.

==== Surfaces ====
The surface of a crystal can produce dislocations in the crystal. Due to the small steps on the surface of most crystals, stress in some regions on the surface is much larger than the average stress in the lattice. This stress leads to dislocations. The dislocations are then propagated into the lattice in the same manner as in grain boundary initiation. In single crystals, the majority of dislocations are formed at the surface. The dislocation density 200 micrometres into the surface of a material has been shown to be six times higher than the density in the bulk. However, in polycrystalline materials the surface sources do not have a major effect because most grains are not in contact with the surface.

==== Interfaces ====
The interface between a metal and an oxide can greatly increase the number of dislocations created. The oxide layer puts the surface of the metal in tension because the oxygen atoms squeeze into the lattice, and the oxygen atoms are under compression. This greatly increases the stress on the surface of the metal and consequently the amount of dislocations formed at the surface. The increased amount of stress on the surface steps results in an increase in dislocations formed and emitted from the interface.

Dislocations may also form and remain in the interface plane between two crystals. This occurs when the lattice spacing of the two crystals do not match, resulting in a misfit of the lattices at the interface. The stress caused by the lattice misfit is released by forming regularly spaced misfit dislocations. Misfit dislocations are edge dislocations with the dislocation line in the interface plane and the Burgers vector in the direction of the interface normal. Interfaces with misfit dislocations may form e.g. as a result of epitaxial crystal growth on a substrate.

==== Irradiation ====
Dislocation loops may form in the damage created by energetic irradiation. A prismatic dislocation loop can be understood as an extra (or missing) collapsed disk of atoms, and can form when interstitial atoms or vacancies cluster together. This may happen directly as a result of single or multiple collision cascades, which results in locally high densities of interstitial atoms and vacancies. In most metals, prismatic dislocation loops are the energetically most preferred clusters of self-interstitial atoms.

=== Interaction and arrangement ===
==== Geometrically necessary dislocations ====
Geometrically necessary dislocations are arrangements of dislocations that can accommodate a limited degree of plastic bending in a crystalline material.
Tangles of dislocations are found at the early stage of deformation and appear as non well-defined boundaries; the process of dynamic recovery leads eventually to the formation of a cellular structure containing boundaries with misorientation lower than 15° (low angle grain boundaries).

==== Pinning ====
Adding pinning points that inhibit the motion of dislocations, such as alloying elements, can introduce stress fields that ultimately strengthen the material by requiring a higher applied stress to overcome the pinning stress and continue dislocation motion.

The effects of strain hardening by accumulation of dislocations and the grain structure formed at high strain can be removed by appropriate heat treatment (annealing) which promotes the recovery and subsequent recrystallization of the material.

The combined processing techniques of work hardening and annealing allow for control over dislocation density, the degree of dislocation entanglement, and ultimately the yield strength of the material.

==== Persistent slip bands ====

Repeated cycling of a material can lead to the generation and bunching of dislocations surrounded by regions that are relatively dislocation free. This pattern forms a ladder like structure known as a &quot;persistent slip bands&quot; (PSB). PSB&#x27;s are so-called, because they leave marks on the surface of metals that even when removed by polishing, return at the same place with continued cycling.

PSB walls are predominately made up of edge dislocations. In between the walls, plasticity is transmitted by screw dislocations.

Where PSB&#x27;s meet the surface, extrusions and intrusions form, which under repeated cyclic loading, can lead to the initiation of a fatigue crack.

=== Movement ===
==== Glide ====
Dislocations can slip in planes containing both the dislocation line and the Burgers vector, the so called glide plane. For a screw dislocation, the dislocation line and the Burgers vector are parallel, so the dislocation may slip in any plane containing the dislocation. For an edge dislocation, the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, so there is one plane in which the dislocation can slip.

==== Climb ====
&quot;Dislocation climb&quot; is an alternative mechanism of dislocation motion that allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane. The driving force for dislocation climb is the movement of vacancies through a crystal lattice. If a vacancy moves next to the boundary of the extra half plane of atoms that forms an edge dislocation, the atom in the half plane closest to the vacancy can &quot;jump&quot; and fill the vacancy. This atom shift &quot;moves&quot; the vacancy in line with the half plane of atoms, causing a shift, or positive climb, of the dislocation. The process of a vacancy being absorbed at the boundary of a half plane of atoms, rather than created, is known as negative climb. Since dislocation climb results from individual atoms &quot;jumping&quot; into vacancies, climb occurs in single atom diameter increments.

During positive climb, the crystal shrinks in the direction perpendicular to the extra half plane of atoms because atoms are being removed from the half plane. Since negative climb involves an addition of atoms to the half plane, the crystal grows in the direction perpendicular to the half plane. Therefore, compressive stress in the direction perpendicular to the half plane promotes positive climb, while tensile stress promotes negative climb. This is one main difference between slip and climb, since slip is caused by only shear stress.

One additional difference between dislocation slip and climb is the temperature dependence. Climb occurs much more rapidly at high temperatures than low temperatures due to an increase in vacancy motion. Slip, on the other hand, has only a small dependence on temperature.

==== Dislocation avalanches ====
Dislocation avalanches occur when multiple simultaneous movement of dislocations occur.

==== Dislocation Velocity ====
Dislocation velocity is largely dependent upon shear stress and temperature, and can often be fit using a power law function:

::formula_11

where formula_12 is a material constant, formula_13 is the applied shear stress, formula_14 is a constant that decreases with increasing temperature. Increased shear stress will increase the dislocation velocity, while increased temperature will typically decrease the dislocation velocity. Greater phonon scattering at higher temperatures is hypothesized to be responsible for increased damping forces which slow the dislocation movement.

==Geometry==

Two main types of mobile dislocations exist: edge and screw. Dislocations found in real materials are typically &quot;mixed&quot;, meaning that they have characteristics of both.

===Edge===
A crystalline material consists of a regular array of atoms, arranged into lattice planes. An edge dislocation is a defect where an extra half-plane of atoms is introduced midway through the crystal, distorting nearby planes of atoms. When enough force is applied from one side of the crystal structure, this extra plane passes through planes of atoms breaking and joining bonds with them until it reaches the grain boundary. The dislocation has two properties, a line direction, which is the direction running along the bottom of the extra half plane, and the Burgers vector which describes the magnitude and direction of distortion to the lattice. In an edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is perpendicular to the line direction.

The stresses caused by an edge dislocation are complex due to its inherent asymmetry. These stresses are described by three equations:

::formula_15

::formula_16

::formula_17

where formula_18 is the shear modulus of the material, formula_19 is the Burgers vector, formula_20 is Poisson&#x27;s ratio and formula_21 and formula_22 are coordinates.

These equations suggest a vertically oriented dumbbell of stresses surrounding the dislocation, with compression experienced by the atoms near the &quot;extra&quot; plane, and tension experienced by those atoms near the &quot;missing&quot; plane.

===Screw===
A &quot;screw dislocation&quot; can be visualized by cutting a crystal along a plane and slipping one half across the other by a lattice vector, the halves fitting back together without leaving a defect. If the cut only goes part way through the crystal, and then slipped, the boundary of the cut is a screw dislocation. It comprises a structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes in the crystal lattice. In pure screw dislocations, the Burgers vector is parallel to the line direction.
An array of screw dislocations can cause what is known as a twist boundary. In a twist boundary, the misalignment between adjacent crystal grains occurs due to the cumulative effect of screw dislocations within the material. These dislocations cause a rotational misorientation between the adjacent grains, leading to a twist-like deformation along the boundary. Twist boundaries can significantly influence the mechanical and electrical properties of materials, affecting phenomena such as grain boundary sliding, creep, and fracture behavior
The stresses caused by a screw dislocation are less complex than those of an edge dislocation and need only one equation, as symmetry allows one radial coordinate to be used:

::formula_23

where formula_18 is the shear modulus of the material, formula_19 is the Burgers vector, and formula_26 is a radial coordinate.
This equation suggests a long cylinder of stress radiating outward from the cylinder and decreasing with distance. This simple model results in an infinite value for the core of the dislocation at formula_27 and so it is only valid for stresses outside of the core of the dislocation. If the Burgers vector is very large, the core may actually be empty resulting in a micropipe, as commonly observed in silicon carbide.

===Mixed===
In many materials, dislocations are found where the line direction and Burgers vector are neither perpendicular nor parallel and these dislocations are called &quot;mixed dislocations&quot;, consisting of both screw and edge character. They are characterized by formula_28, the angle between the line direction and Burgers vector, where formula_29 for pure edge dislocations and formula_30 for screw dislocations.

===Partial===
Partial dislocations leave behind a stacking fault. Two types of partial dislocation are the &quot;Frank partial dislocation&quot; which is sessile and the &quot;Shockley partial dislocation&quot; which is glissile.

A Frank partial dislocation is formed by inserting or removing a layer of atoms on the {111} plane which is then bounded by the Frank partial. Removal of a close packed layer is known as an &quot;intrinsic&quot; stacking fault and inserting a layer is known as an &quot;extrinsic&quot; stacking fault. The Burgers vector is normal to the {111} glide plane so the dislocation cannot glide and can only move through &quot;climb&quot;.

In order to lower the overall energy of the lattice, edge and screw dislocations typically disassociate into a stacking fault bounded by two Shockley partial dislocations. The width of this stacking-fault region is proportional to the stacking-fault energy of the material. The combined effect is known as an &quot;extended dislocation&quot; and is able to glide as a unit. However, dissociated screw dislocations must recombine before they can cross slip, making it difficult for these dislocations to move around barriers. Materials with low stacking-fault energies have the greatest dislocation dissociation and are therefore more readily cold worked.

=== Stair-rod and the Lomer–Cottrell junction ===
If two glide dislocations that lie on different {111} planes split into Shockley partials and intersect, they will produce a stair-rod dislocation with a Lomer-Cottrell dislocation at its apex. It is called a &quot;stair-rod&quot; because it is analogous to the rod that keeps carpet in-place on a stair.

=== Jog ===

A Jog describes the steps of a dislocation line that are not in the glide plane of a crystal structure. A dislocation line is rarely uniformly straight, often containing many curves and steps that can impede or facilitate dislocation movement by acting as pinpoints or nucleation points respectively. Because jogs are out of the glide plane, under shear they cannot move by glide (movement along the glide plane). They instead must rely on vacancy diffusion facilitated climb to move through the lattice. Away from the melting point of a material, vacancy diffusion is a slow process, so jogs act as immobile barriers at room temperature for most metals.

Jogs typically form when two non-parallel dislocations cross during slip. The presence of jogs in a material increases its yield strength by preventing easy glide of dislocations. A pair of immobile jogs in a dislocation will act as a Frank–Read source under shear, increasing the overall dislocation density of a material. When a material&#x27;s yield strength is increased via dislocation density increase, particularly when done by mechanical work, it is called work hardening. At high temperatures, vacancy facilitated movement of jogs becomes a much faster process, diminishing their overall effectiveness in impeding dislocation movement.

=== Kink ===
Kinks are steps in a dislocation line parallel to glide planes. Unlike jogs, they facilitate glide by acting as a nucleation point for dislocation movement. The lateral spreading of a kink from the nucleation point allows for forward propagation of the dislocation while only moving a few atoms at a time, reducing the overall energy barrier to slip.

== Example in two dimensions (2D) ==
In two dimensions (2D) only the edge dislocations exist, which play a central role in melting of 2D crystals, but not the screw dislocation.
Those dislocations are topological point defects which implies that they cannot be created isolated by an affine transformation without cutting the hexagonal crystal up to infinity (or at least up to its border). They can only be created in pairs with antiparallel Burgers vector. If a lot of dislocations are e. g. thermally excited, the discrete translational order of the crystal is destroyed. Simultaneously, the shear modulus and the Young&#x27;s modulus disappear, which implies that the crystal is molten to a fluid phase. The orientational order is not yet destroyed (as indicated by lattice lines in one direction) and one finds - very similar to liquid crystals - a fluid phase with typically a six-folded director field. This so-called hexatic phase still has an orientational stiffness. The isotropic fluid phase appears, if the dislocations dissociate into isolated five-folded and seven-folded disclinations. This two step melting is described within the so-called Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young-theory (KTHNY theory), based on two transitions of Kosterlitz-Thouless-type.

==Observation==
=== Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ===

Transmission electron microscopy can be used to observe dislocations within the microstructure of the material. Thin foils of material are prepared to render them transparent to the electron beam of the microscope. The electron beam undergoes diffraction by the regular crystal lattice planes into a diffraction pattern and contrast is generated in the image by this diffraction (as well as by thickness variations, varying strain, and other mechanisms). Dislocations have different local atomic structure and produce a strain field, and therefore will cause the electrons in the microscope to scatter in different ways. Note the characteristic &#x27;wiggly&#x27; contrast of the dislocation lines as they pass through the thickness of the material in the figure (dislocations cannot end in a crystal, and these dislocations are terminating at the surfaces since the image is a 2D projection).

Dislocations do not have random structures, the local atomic structure of a dislocation is determined by the Burgers vector. One very useful application of the TEM in dislocation imaging is the ability to experimentally determine the Burgers vector. Determination of the Burgers vector is achieved by what is known as formula_31 (&quot;g dot b&quot;) analysis. When performing dark field microscopy with the TEM, a diffracted spot is selected to form the image (as mentioned before, lattice planes diffract the beam into spots), and the image is formed using only electrons that were diffracted by the plane responsible for that diffraction spot. The vector in the diffraction pattern from the transmitted spot to the diffracted spot is the formula_32 vector. The contrast of a dislocation is scaled by a factor of the dot product of this vector and the Burgers vector (formula_31). As a result, if the Burgers vector and formula_32 vector are perpendicular, there will be no signal from the dislocation and the dislocation will not appear at all in the image. Therefore, by examining different dark field images formed from spots with different g vectors, the Burgers vector can be determined.

=== Other methods ===
Field ion microscopy and atom probe techniques offer methods of producing much higher magnifications (typically 3 million times and above) and permit the observation of dislocations at an atomic level. Where surface relief can be resolved to the level of an atomic step, screw dislocations appear as distinctive spiral features – thus revealing an important mechanism of crystal growth: where there is a surface step, atoms can more easily add to the crystal, and the surface step associated with a screw dislocation is never destroyed no matter how many atoms are added to it.

==== Chemical etching ====
When a dislocation line intersects the surface of a metallic material, the associated strain field locally increases the relative susceptibility of the material to acid etching and an etch pit of regular geometrical format results. In this way, dislocations in silicon, for example, can be observed &quot;indirectly&quot; using an interference microscope. Crystal orientation can be determined by the shape of the etch pits associated with the dislocations.

If the material is deformed and repeatedly re-etched, a series of etch pits can be produced which effectively trace the movement of the dislocation in question.

== Dislocation forces ==

=== Forces on dislocations ===
Dislocation motion as a result of external stress on a crystal lattice can be described using virtual internal forces which act perpendicular to the dislocation line. The Peach-Koehler equation can be used to calculate the force per unit length on a dislocation as a function of the Burgers vector, formula_19, stress, formula_36, and the sense vector, formula_37.

::formula_38

The force per unit length of dislocation is a function of the general state of stress, formula_39, and the sense vector, formula_37.

::formula_41

The components of the stress field can be obtained from the Burgers vector, normal stresses, formula_36, and shear stresses, formula_13.

::formula_44

=== Forces between dislocations ===
The force between dislocations can be derived from the energy of interactions of the dislocations, formula_45. The work done by displacing cut faces parallel to a chosen axis that creates one dislocation in the stress field of another displacement. For the formula_21 and formula_22 directions:

::formula_48

The forces are then found by taking the derivatives.

::formula_49

=== Free surface forces ===
Dislocations will also tend to move towards free surfaces due to the lower strain energy. This fictitious force can be expressed for a screw dislocation with the formula_22 component equal to zero as:

::formula_51

where formula_52 is the distance from free surface in the formula_21 direction. The force for an edge dislocation with formula_54 can be expressed as:

::formula_55

<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
Most countries of the world have different names in different languages. Some countries have also undergone name changes for political or other reasons. Countries are listed alphabetically by their most common name in English. Each English name is followed by its most common equivalents in other languages, listed in English alphabetical order (ignoring accents) by name and by language. Historical and/or alternative versions, where included, are noted as such. Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents are also listed. See also: List of alternative country names

Please format entries as follows: for languages written in the Latin alphabet, write &quot;Name (language)&quot;, for example, &quot; (Portuguese)&quot;, and add it to the list according to English rules of alphabetical order. For languages written in other writing systems, write &quot;Romanization - native script (language)&quot;, for example &quot; - (Yiddish)&quot;, and alphabetize it in the list by the Romanized form.

Due to its size, this list has been split into four parts:
*List of country names in various languages (A–C)
*List of country names in various languages (D–I)
*List of country names in various languages (J–P)

<text>Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, or simply Birdman or The Galaxy Trio, is an American animated television series made by Hanna-Barbera Productions that debuted on NBC on September 9, 1967, and ran on Saturday mornings until January 20, 1968. The program consists of two segments: &quot;Birdman,&quot; depicting the adventures of a winged superhero (created by Alex Toth, creator of &quot;Space Ghost&quot;) powered by the sun, and &quot;The Galaxy Trio,&quot; centered around the adventures of a patrol of interstellar superheroes. Each segment was a complete independent story, and the characters of each segment did not interact with those of the other, except for a bumper that has all four heroes defeating a prehistoric monster.

A parody series, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, premiered on Adult Swim on September 2, 2001, concluding on July 22, 2007 after four seasons, with a special, &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney General&quot;, premiering on October 15, 2018, and a spin-off series, &quot;Birdgirl&quot;, premiering on April 5, 2021.

==Segments==
===Birdman===
Birdman (voiced by Keith Andes) is an ordinary human who has been endowed by the sun god Ra with the ability to shoot solar rays from his fists and project quasi-solid &quot;solar shields&quot; to defend himself against attacks (Birdman&#x27;s origin is only vaguely, and only briefly, hinted at during the series. His real name is there given as Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Randall). After he had acquired his avian—and other—powers, he was recruited by a top-secret government agency, Inter-Nation Security, and now works full-time fighting crime, assisted by his pet eagle, who responds to the name of Avenger. In addition to the abilities he received from Ra, Birdman also possesses the power of flight, thanks to the giant wings which sprout from his back. It is possible Birdman is fireproof; being forced into an incinerator recharged rather than hurt him. His sole weakness is that he has to recharge his superhuman powers periodically, through exposure either to the sun&#x27;s rays or to a comparable source of heat and/or light such as a desk lamp (when he was once shrunken to insect proportions) or the aforementioned incinerator, a weakness that is exposed in nearly every episode. His trademark is his battle cry of &quot;Biiiiirdman!!!&quot; whenever he goes into battle.

He is assisted by his supporting characters:

* Falcon 7 (voiced by Don Messick) – Birdman&#x27;s eye patch-wearing contact with Inter-Nation Security, and the person from whom Birdman typically receives his missions.
* Birdboy (voiced by Dick Beals) – A sidekick for Birdman. The two first met when Birdman happened upon a shipwreck, of which Birdboy was the only apparent survivor. Since the boy was near death from exposure, Birdman transferred some of his own super energy to him, reviving him and giving powers similar to Birdman&#x27;s, and he went on to aid him in several episodes. Birdboy lacks the natural feathered wings sported by Birdman, however, and is only able to fly with the assistance of the mechanical wings strapped to his back. He spends much of his time searching for his father, who was lost in the wreck, but this is never resolved.
* General Stone (voiced by Don Messick) – General Stone appears several times in &quot;Birdman&quot; with other military leaders, and tends to find himself on the receiving end of the villains&#x27; schemes.

Birdman has fought the sinister organization F.E.A.R. that is led by Number One (voiced by John Stephenson) and Birdman&#x27;s &quot;number one&quot; enemy. F.E.A.R. is behind many plots over the course of the series, frequently employing supervillains to perform nefarious tasks. The organization was seemingly defeated for good and its leader arrested in &quot;The Wings of F.E.A.R.&quot;, but it occasionally resurfaced without any explanation.

Birdman has also fought some other villains with some of them appearing either having one appearance or having more than one appearance. They consist of:

* Dr. Millennium (voiced by Hal Smith) - A supervillain who appeared in &quot;The Menace of Dr. Millennium&quot;, using a time-manipulating machine to commit crimes. He returned in &quot;The Revenge of Dr. Millennium&quot; where he tried to exact his revenge on Birdman and take over the world from the past.
* X the Eliminator (voiced by John Stephenson) - A mercenary hired by F.E.A.R. to eliminate Birdman. He is charged with bringing back Birdman&#x27;s crest from his helmet as proof of his accomplishment.
* The Ruthless Ringmaster (voiced by Vic Perrin) - An agent of F.E.A.R.
* Morto the Marauder (voiced by Vic Perrin) - A criminal genius and evidently once a significant threat to the world, Morto twice escaped from prison with his mechanical know-how and wreaked havoc in &quot;Morto the Marauder&quot; and &quot;Morto Rides Again&quot;.
* Cumulus the Storm King (voiced by Henry Corden) - A supervillain who can control the weather.
* Nitron the Human Bomb (voiced by Barney Phillips) - A scientist who got the capabilities and powers of a chemical called NITRON. He is eager to join F.E.A.R, for which Number One tells him to finish the atomic reactor USS-CO-BOLT and Birdman, but fails.
* The Mummer - A supervillain who is a master of disguise. Unlike most of Birdman&#x27;s enemies, the Mummer was able to escape from him thanks to his disguises making him one of a few villains to get away.
* Kiroff - A supervillain who was responsible for causing worldwide earthquakes.
* Zardo - A supervillain who at one time captured Avenger. He received a complete redesign in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;.
* The Constrictor - Dressed like a snake and has two boa constrictors as his pets, this supervillain captures Avenger and tries to use him in order to capture Birdman. Birdman finds Avenger and burns Constrictor&#x27;s headquarters down. Constrictor realizes Birdman is too powerful to be defeated and manages to escape, Birdman never caught the Constrictor making him one of a few villains to get away.
* Reducto (voiced by John Stephenson): A supervillain who wields a shrink ray. He uses this ray to demand money from Central City or he will shrink it. After being defeated by Birdman, he is shrunken down to microscopic size.
* Doctor Shark - A supervillain who fought Birdman underwater and had the face of a shark, but the body of a man. Birdman had to constantly regain his strength by battling Doctor Shark in small increments so that he did not lose his energy from being away from the sun. Doctor Shark was eventually defeated.
* Hannibal the Hunter - A big game hunter who is determined to hunt down Birdman.
* Mentor the Mind-Taker (voiced by Don Messick) - Mentor has the ability to send cerebral messages to a person or animal to do his bidding. He uses this ability to get Birdman to steal missiles from the United States government. He plans on using these missiles to start a war between two countries. He was renamed Mentok when he appeared in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;. The name change was also carried over to the Hanna-Barbera Beyond comics.
* Dr. Freezoid - Dr. Freezoid has a weapon that can turn an entire city block into ice. He has a retreat at the North Pole. Birdman causes him to self-destruct his base of operations with his own weapons trapping Dr. Freezoid inside.
* The Duplicator (voiced by Frank Gerstle) - An old man with large glasses, the Deadly Duplicator uses his glasses to create duplicates of the people that he zaps. The Deadly Duplicator has full control over the twin and uses them to help him in his plans to take over the world, but of course is thwarted by Birdman.
* Professor Nightshade (voiced by Henry Corden) - An agent of F.E.A.R., he steals a solar box that has the power to send entire cities into the fourth dimension. Professor Nightshade traps Birdman and tries to use the solar box on him, but it reacts to Birdman differently: instead of sending Birdman into the fourth dimension, it gives him energy to become strong. When Prof. Nightshade tries to use it again on him, it reflects off of Birdman and Nightshade accidentally sends himself into the fourth dimension. Birdman then destroys the machine.
* The Chameleon - A scientist who created a transformation serum that gave him the ability to shapeshift into whatever he wants, whether it&#x27;s people, animals, or even inanimate objects. In the end, the serum in his body ran out and Birdman handed him over the police.
* Captain Moray of the Deep (voiced by Paul Frees) - Captain Moray abducts his seventh scientist. He forces them to develop a nuclear reactor. Birdman disguises himself as a scientist and gets abducted by Moray, but Moray knew it was him and a great battle ensues. Birdman is then captured for real. He sends a signal to Birdboy to find him. As Birdman is about to enter a nuclear reactor (which should have killed him), his energy is instead restored enabling him to end the villainy of Captain Moray as Birdman hands him over to the Navy.
* The Aliens of the Purple Moss - These were aliens who came to Earth to take it over. Fortunately, Birdman was informed and stopped the aliens in a heated battle.
* The Brain Thief (voiced by Don Messick) - A mad scientist named Doctor Shado captures four other scientists and tries to steal the information in their minds.
* Dr. Mentaur - A scientist who turned a woman into Birdgirl through hypnosis, a super serum, and some metal wings. Eventually, he was defeated and Birdgirl became normal again.
** Birdgirl - Created by Dr. Mentaur through hypnosis, a super serum and some metal wings. She was an aerialist before she met Dr. Mentaur. While under hypnosis, she was used to defeat Birdman. While captured, Birdman tricked her into letting him go outside as a last request. Regaining his strength from the sun, this allowed Birdman to defeat Dr. Mentaur and save Birdgirl.
* The Magnatroid - This was a robot created by a scientist to destroy Birdman.
* Medusa (voiced by June Foray) a.k.a. &quot;the Empress of Evil&quot; - Medusa captures the Prince of the Maja Raja and then captures Birdman. The Prince gives Birdman a diamond from his turban that he says came from the sun god, Ra. After giving it to Birdman, Birdman is able to regain his strength and defeat Medusa. She throws herself into a pit of demons to elude him.
* Spyro - Head of a master spy syndicate, he hijacked the atomic city supply train to do some evil bidding.
* Dr. Claw - A scientist that used an ant serum to inject into his creation, the Ant Ape. When he injects his robot creation, the Ant Ape becomes super-strong and nearly unstoppable, but Birdman defeats them.
* The Speed Demon - A convicted felon already put away by Birdman retaliates by creating a potion that gives him super-speed. He runs around stealing money and jewels from various places. He then realizes that with his new power, he cannot be defeated. Speed Demon captures Birdman and almost defeats him, but Birman comes out on top. In the end, Speed Demon&#x27;s speed causes his aging process to speed up rapidly while evading a missile and he becomes an old man, losing the battle.
* Vulturo (voiced by Vic Perrin) - Dr. Vult is an evil scientist who made a vulture-like costume to combat Birdman. He first appeared in &quot;Vulturo, Prince of Darkness&quot; where he was hired by F.E.A.R. to destroy Birdman. In &quot;The Return of Vulturo&quot;, Vulturo tried to exact his revenge that involved kidnapping Birdboy.
* The Barracuda - A supervillain who plans on using torpedoes and submarines to loot ships and to start wars between countries.
* Murro (sic) the Marauder: (voiced by Hal Smith) This evil villain can commandeer the shadows of unsuspecting victims. Although the episode title card identifies the character as Murro, he is referred to &quot;Murko&quot; throughout the segment.

===Galaxy Trio===
The Galaxy Trio is a group of three extraterrestrial superheroes, Vapor Man, Meteor Man, and Gravity Girl, who patrol space in their cruiser &quot;Condor One&quot;. They maintain order and fight evildoers in the name of the Galactic Patrol law enforcement agency. The ship was equipped with a &quot;displacer&quot;, that is, a teleportation device.

* Vapor Man (voiced by Don Messick) – He has the ability to transform part or all of his body into gaseous form (a power shared by at least some residents of his home planet of Vaporus), enabling him to fly, escape from physical bonds, and squeeze through very small spaces, as well as producing various forms of &quot;vapor&quot; (such as &quot;freeze vapor&quot;) from his hands.
* Meteor Man (voiced by Ted Cassidy) – A native of the planet Meteorus. Meteor Man is distinguished by his ability to increase or decrease the size of any part of his body. He gains superhuman strength in any limb that he chooses to enlarge.
* Gravity Girl (voiced by Virginia Eiler) – She has the ability to bend the laws of gravity to her will, allowing her to fly and lift very heavy objects with her mind. The daughter of the king of the planet Gravitas, she left her luxurious home and life of privilege at an early age to fight crime with the Galactic Patrol and was subsequently assigned to the Galaxy Trio team, with whom she has served ever since.

The Galaxy Trio get their missions from a man named the Chief.

The Galaxy Trio faces off against an assortment of villains with some of them appearing more than one:

* Computron - A robot from Orbus 4 that plotted to take control of it.
* Lotar - The twin brother of Neptar on the planet Aqueus who conspires to take his brother&#x27;s throne.

==Episodes==
Each episode featured two &quot;Birdman&quot; segments with one &quot;Galaxy Trio&quot; segment between them.

==In other media==
Birdman appeared in issues 1 through 7 (April 1968 – October 1969) of the &quot;Hanna-Barbera Super TV Heroes&quot; comic book, published by Gold Key Comics. He was joined in issue 2 by the Galaxy Trio (their first appearance together).

In 1997, he was also featured in issue #5 of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Cartoon Network Presents: Toonami&quot; comic book series.

In 2000, the character of Birdman was revived three decades later in the parody Cartoon Network/Adult Swim TV series &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;; several characters from &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot; appeared in this satire.

In 2016, Birdman and the Galaxy Trio played a major role in the DC Comics series &quot;Future Quest&quot;. The series also featured characters from various animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera such as &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, &quot;The Herculoids&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles&quot;, and &quot;Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor&quot;.

By 2021, Gravity Girl makes a cameo in &quot;Jellystone!&quot; She was seen in Mayor Huckleberry Hound&#x27;s flashback as the referee of the infamous final fight of The Funky Phantom where she pulled him out of the ring after he misused his ghostly abilities on Mightor. Birdman appears in season 3 as a picture, and he is revealed to be dead. Another episode has &quot;Space Ghost&quot; villains Brak, Zorak and Moltar cosplaying as the Galaxy Trio to infiltrate a convention.

==Home media==
On July 17, 2007, Warner Home Video released &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. This DVD set was re-released by the company&#x27;s Warner Archive division as a manufacture-on-demand (MOD) release on January 10, 2017. Birdman also accidentally appeared on the menu screen for the &quot;DC Super Heroes: The Filmation Adventures&quot;, a DVD set which featured DC Comics-based superhero cartoons produced by Filmation for &quot;The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure&quot; (which coincidentally premiered the same day as &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot;), in 2008. Warner Home Video has stated that this was a mistake, and that Hawkman was supposed to be in Birdman&#x27;s place.

<doc id="795351" wikidata="Q15486291" url="?curid=795351" title="Fefe Dobson (album)">
<text>Fefe Dobson is the debut album of Canadian singer-songwriter Fefe Dobson. It was released on December 9, 2003. The album was co-written by Dobson with producers Jay Levine and James Bryan McCollum. The album consists mainly of pop rock and punk music, and deals mainly with the topics of love and heartbreak. Several songs on the album are done acoustically while the remaining tracks feature prominent guitar and drum beats.

The album was released to generally positive reviews from critics; however, its commercial performance was mixed. The album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums Chart. It debuted at number 111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, eventually peaking at 67. Despite the minor success of the single &quot;Everything&quot; in the UK, the album failed to chart there, or anywhere outside of the US and Canada.

The album did, however, spawn several successful singles. The first of these, titled &quot;Bye Bye Boyfriend&quot; was released during the final quarter of 2003 to generally positive critical and commercial performance. However, the single was only released in Canada. The second single, &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, was her first single to be released internationally. The single became her second hit in Canada, as well as her only single to date that has charted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. In 2004, Dobson released a new single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go (Girls and Boys)&quot;, which was then appended to later pressings of the album. The song was also featured in a Tommy Hilfiger commercial starring Dobson.

In March 2004, the album was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for sales of 100,000 copies. It has also sold over 300,000 copies in the US, giving it sales a roundabout 500,000 copies worldwide.

==Background==
Dobson started writing at the age of 14, and caught the ear of Jive Records a year later. The label loved her voice and set her up with a number of producers, with an eye towards developing a pop star. But she refused the idea and left the label. After that experience, Dobson met Jay Levine and signed with Nelly Furtado&#x27;s manager Chris Smith. Smith arranged showcases with several labels. Universal Music Canada president Randy Lennox showed interest in her, and coaxed Island Def Jam CEO Lyor Cohen and his head of A&amp;R, Jeff Fenster, to fly to Toronto for another showcase. Dobson played a showcase for Island/Def Jam; about 30 seconds into the first song —- a punk thrash track about longing, titled &quot;Stupid Little Love Song&quot;—-the executives were impressed and signed her. When in the recording studio, she hung up inspirational pictures of Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, Coldplay, Jeff Buckley, and The Vines to help motivate her sound and to commemorate the artists who influenced her.

Dobson wrote most of the music on the album, along with producer Jay Levine. However, several other producers pitched in to help write for the album, including James Bryan McCollum. The album was written in approximately two years, mainly by Dobson herself.

==Composition==
The music heard on Fefe Dobson&#x27;s debut album is generally pop-rock, as well as some traces of punk music. Several songs on the album are also in an acoustic format, stripped down to just Dobson and the guitar. The music was different from most music put out at the time, such as recent releases by Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. In fact, Dobson originally signed with Jive Records, who intended to make her the next big pop star. However, Dobson didn&#x27;t want to be a pop-star and wanted to make her own type of music, and quickly left the label.

The first track on the album is titled &quot;Stupid Little Love Song&quot;. Lyrically, the song is an uptempo rock/punk song that lyrically speaks of Dobson&#x27;s love for someone who is famous, stating lyrics such as &quot;I came by taxi/you can by limousine&quot;. The second song on the album is the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Bye Bye Boyfriend&quot;. The song&#x27;s verse is a moderately paced beat, fueled by guitar and drums. During the verse, Dobson states she&#x27;s sorry for leaving her boyfriend. However, as the chorus arrives, the lyrical content and music change, becoming more uptempo and guitar driven. The lyrics also show a sudden change, as she talks of letting him go as though he was nothing special. &quot;Take Me Away&quot; is the third track on the album, as well as the second single (first international release). The single performed well on singles charts in the US and Canada, reaching the top 20 in Canada. It is a moderately paced pop-rock tune that lyrically speaks of running away with someone she loves. &quot;Everything&quot; is the fourth song on the album, and the third single as well. Lyrically the song revolves around Dobson asking her lover if he is ready to be committed to her and their relationship. It is her only song to chart in the UK to date, where it had minor success on their main singles chart. &quot;Rock It &#x27;Til You Drop It&quot; is the fifth song from Dobson&#x27;s debut album. The single is an uptempo dance/rock track that features Tone Lōc on vocals. The song lyrically speaks of dancing on the dancefloor with a guy. &quot;Revolution Song&quot; is the sixth track on the album, and is one of the acoustic songs featured on the album. It has been stripped down to nothing other than Dobson&#x27;s vocals and the acoustic guitar.

&quot;Kiss Me Fool&quot; is the seventh song placed on the album, and is yet another uptempo rock song. Lyrically the song talks of Dobson wanting her love interest to kiss her. She also questions what she must change about herself to please the man she has her eyes set on. &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the more personal songs on the album, as well as one of the most rock driven and dark songs on the album. It talks about Dobson&#x27;s father, and all the mistakes that he made while trying to raise her. In the song, Dobson speaks of her independence, and how she never really did need him in her life. The end of the chorus shows Dobson yelling that he&#x27;s &quot;unforgiven&quot;. &quot;We Went For a Ride&quot; is the ninth song to be placed on the album. The song is generally slower and more pop oriented than the rest of the album. The lyrics speak of riding away with her love interest, to never come back and drive away from all of their problems. &quot;Give It Up&quot; is the tenth track on the album. The verse of the song is generally slower and slower-paced than most music on the album, however, the chorus quickly shifts to a rock driven beat filled with drums and bass. Lyrically Dobson is telling her ex that there&#x27;s nothing he can do to win her back, and he should just &quot;give it up&quot;. &quot;Julia&quot; is another acoustic song on the album, and is reportedly about her friend who had an eating disorder. &quot;8x10&quot; is the final track listed on the album. It is another acoustic song on the album, and is considered a good ending to the album by some critics.

==Release and reception==

===Commercial performance===
The album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums Chart. It debuted at number 111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, eventually peaking at 67. Despite the minor success of the single, &quot;Everything&quot; in the UK, the album failed to chart there, as well as chart anywhere outside of the US and Canada.

===Critical reception===
The album was met with generally positive reviews from critics and fans. Music-Review.com stated that &quot;Fefe doesn&#x27;t mess around. The very first song is the very best song; if &quot;Stupid Little Love Song&quot; was released as a single, it would blow this narrow little worldwide open with its tight slashing crunching goodness. Not only is it fast and hard and funky like a Thierry Henry penalty kick, but it&#x27;s funny too: our protagonist is feeling a little outmatched by her boyfriend&#x27;s super-accomplished family, and doesn&#x27;t know how to deal: &quot;You&#x27;re on the road to Harvard Law / I&#x27;m on the bus to Arkansas&quot;. His mother&#x27;s a Senator, his dad&#x27;s got his own talk show, he&#x27;s a big jocky handsome guy, and all she has for him is...pause... &quot;Just a stupid little love song!&quot; and they all spazz out with the guitars again. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s prime Clash or anything, but the way Dobson yells &quot;Put &#x27;em up!&quot; in the breaks is pretty inspiring.&quot;

Johnny Loftus of allmusic.com stated in his review of the album that &quot;...Dobson created a rousing debut that, despite being a highly melodic and relentlessly effective pop album, is rescued from flavor-of-the-moment dissipation by a schizophrenic rock crunch and her own attractively bad attitude.&quot; He went on to say that &quot; Fefe Dobson definitely has an opportunistic streak, and its stylistic cherry-picking can be trying. But production niceties and savvy marketing can&#x27;t fake the talent Fefe has. It&#x27;s her willingness to inject pop with pluck and rock as much as she flutters that makes Dobson&#x27;s debut much more than just a popternative clone. Best of all, it still caters to those casual fans who won&#x27;t know any better.&quot; The review ends with the album being awarded four out of five stars.

==Promotion==
During much of 2004, Dobson promoted her debut album, appearing for a live performance on &quot;TRL&quot; and numerous magazine covers and articles. Dobson made an appearance on the NBC series &quot;American Dreams&quot;, in which she played the role of Tina Turner, covering the song &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;. She was also the opening act on Justin Timberlake&#x27;s European tour, which was especially poignant inasmuch as when she was 13 she had a major crush on him. That July, she released a new single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go (Girls and Boys)&quot;, which was also featured in a Tommy Hilfiger commercial starring the singer. The album was later reissued with that single added. Dobson also had a new song, &quot;If You Walk Away&quot;, on the soundtrack for &quot;Raising Helen&quot;.

==Singles==
*&quot;Bye Bye Boyfriend&quot; is the first single from the album, and was released in the final quarter of 2003. The single was released only in Canada, which is Dobson&#x27;s home country. The single became a major hit there, peaking at number 8 on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single also had a music video, which was directed by Vale George and produced by Mark Hesselink.
*&quot;Take Me Away&quot; is the official second single from the album. It was sent to radio on August 18, 2003, and received a generally positive reception from music critics. It is her debut single in the US and UK, due to her previous single only being released in Canada. The single failed to make an impact in the UK, however it reached the top 20 of the Canadian Hot 100, becoming her second consecutive single to do so. It is also her only single to date that has charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in the US, where it peaked at 87.
*&quot;Everything&quot; is the third official single from the album, and second international single. The song was released on May 20, 2004, in the US, Canada and the UK. The single failed to have the same success as her previous singles in Canada, where it failed to chart. It has, however, became Dobson&#x27;s only single to date that has charted in the UK, where it reached a peak of 47.
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Go (Girls and Boys)&quot; is the fourth and final single from the album, released on June 29, 2004, as the lead single from the album&#x27;s reissue. The single became yet another hit for Dobson in her home country of Canada, where it reached a peak of 10, making it her second single to reach the top ten of the Canadian Hot 100.

<doc id="795364" wikidata="Q3780709" url="?curid=795364" title="Humanitarian Service Medal">
<text>The Humanitarian Service Medal (HSM) is a military service medal of the United States Armed Forces which was created on January 19, 1977 by President Gerald Ford under . The medal may be awarded to members of the United States military (including Reserve and National Guard members) who distinguish themselves by meritorious participation in specified military acts or operations of a humanitarian nature.

==Creation==
Julia V. Taft, the director of the Interagency Task Force (IATF) for Indochinese resettlement proposed the establishment of a Humanitarian Service Medal for U.S. military personnel and submitted the request to President Gerald R. Ford on November 10, 1975. The medal was to be awarded to those personnel that participated in the evacuation of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees after the Vietnam War. The proposal was met with dissent by Army Lieutenant General Harold G. Moore, who was concerned that the military was over-decorating its personnel with awards of participation rather than those of extraordinary achievement. He proposed a certificate of achievement as a more appropriate recognition. Army Lieutenant General John W. Vessey supported the creation of the medal as a precedent to recognize military participation in major humanitarian actions. Vessey&#x27;s view prevailed and President Ford established the medal in 1977 as one of the last acts of his presidency.

==Criteria==
This medal is presented as an individual service medal. The activities in which the Humanitarian Service Medal may be authorized are designated by the United States Department of Defense. Such activities include natural disaster relief, evacuation of non-combatants from a hostile area, or humanitarian support to refugees. This medal may not be awarded for services rendered in domestic disturbances involving law enforcement, riots, or protection of property. This medal may also not be presented if either the Armed Forces Service Medal or Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was presented for the same period of service.

The Humanitarian Service Medal is retroactive to April 2, 1975. 

The Department of the Army awards the Civilian Award for Humanitarian Service for similar service by Army civilian employees, as well as private U.S. and foreign citizens.

==Appearance==
Centered on the obverse of the medal within a circle, is a right hand pointing diagonally upward with open palm, (to symbolize a giving or helping hand). At the top of the reverse of the medal is the inscription, &quot;For Humanitarian Service&quot; in three lines. Below this is an oak branch, with three leaves and three acorns, and below this, around the outside edge of the medal, is the inscription, &quot;United States Armed Forces&quot;.

; Additional awards and devices
Subsequent awards of the Humanitarian Service Medal are denoted by wearing a bronze service star on the HSM suspension and service ribbon. A silver service star is worn in lieu of five bronze service stars.

==Approved operations==
Below is a non-exhaustive list of approved operations in accordance with the Department of Defense.

<text>K-131 was a Project 675 (NATO reporting name Echo II-class submarine) of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Northern Fleet, she was also redesignated K-192.

==Design and description==
The Echo II class was a nuclear-powered cruise-missile submarine, which could carry up to eight anti-ship missiles, designed to strike any aircraft carrier-borne nuclear threat. The missiles could be either conventional or nuclear and all eight fired within twenty minutes. The submarine would need to be surfaced and carried an array of electronics, radar and sonar to feed data to the missile while en route to its target. &quot;K-131&quot; also had six torpedo tubes forward and four torpedo tubes aft.

With a displacement of 5,000 tons when surfaced and 6,000 tons when submerged, &quot;K-131&quot; was long and had a beam of and a draft of . She was powered by two pressurized-water nuclear reactors generating through two propellers for a maximum speed of . She was manned by about 90 crew members.

==Operational history==
===Fire===
On 18 June 1984, while under the command of Captain First Rank E. Selivanov, &quot;K-131&quot; suffered a catastrophic fire while on patrol in the Norwegian Sea off the Kola Peninsula. A short circuit in an electrical switchboard in the eighth compartment ignited the clothes of an electrical officer, and spread first to other equipment in that compartment, then into the seventh compartment. Before it was extinguished, the fire had killed 13 men.

===Aid===
The fire affected one of the two reactors, forcing the submarine to surface. Using &quot;K-131&quot;″s fresh water supplies, the submarine&#x27;s crew managed to reduce the temperature in the burning compartments from to , but by this time the Soviet cargo ship &quot;Konstantin Yuon&quot; had arrived and hooked up a pipe to help. All the cooling water went into the ocean, and its radioactivity levels were unknown. The service ship &quot;Amur&quot;, which had a nuclear waste processing plant on board, then arrived to assist &quot;K-131&quot;. However, the heavily contaminated water caused &quot;Amur&quot;s treatment plant to break down. How much nuclear waste leaked into the ocean has never been fully verified.

==Fate==
After returning to the Soviet Union, &quot;K-131&quot; was anchored in Ara Bay. Then she was towed to Russian Shipyard No. 10—Shkval. She was renamed K-192. On June 25, 1989 a serious leak occurred in a cooling pipe. Photos of the evaporating cooling water coming out from the reactor compartment became front-page news in Norway. The submarine was then stationed at the Ara-guba Naval base on the Kola Peninsula. At the end of November 1996 the Naval Yard in Polyarny defuelled the 37 years old K-5 submarine.

<text>Monogeneans, members of the class Monogenea, are a group of ectoparasitic flatworms commonly found on the skin, gills, or fins of fish. They have a direct lifecycle and do not require an intermediate host. Adults are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female reproductive structures.

Some monogeneans are oviparous (egg-laying) and some are viviparous (live-bearing). Oviparous varieties release eggs into the water. Viviparous varieties release larvae, which immediately attach to another host. The genus &quot;Gyrodactylus&quot; is an example of a viviparous variety, while the genus &quot;Dactylogyrus&quot; is an example of an oviparous variety.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Freshwater fish that become infected with this parasite become lethargic and end up swimming towards the surface of the water. In addition, some may be seen rubbing the bottom or sides of their skin where the parasite is located. Infected skin where the parasite is attached may show areas of scale loss and may produce a pinkish fluid. Gills that are infected may appear swollen and pale. &quot;Pipping&quot;, which is gulping for air at the water surface, could indicate severe respiratory distress.

In salt water fish, Monogeneans can infect the skin and gills, resulting in irritations to the host. Heavy infections could result in erratic swimming behavior. Affected gills may become irritated and swollen.

==Characteristics==
Monogenea are small parasitic flatworms mainly found on skin or gills of fish.
They are rarely longer than about 2 cm. A few species infecting certain marine fish are larger, and marine forms are generally larger than those found on freshwater hosts. Monogenea are often capable of dramatically elongating and shortening as they move. Biologists need to ensure that specimens are completely relaxed before measurements are taken.

Monogeneans lack respiratory, skeletal, and circulatory systems but they do have posterior attachment structures in the form of adhesives, clamps, hamuli and suckers. Like other flatworms, Monogenea have no true body cavity (coelom). They have a simple digestive system consisting of a mouth opening with a muscular pharynx and an intestine with no terminal opening (anus).

Monogenea are Platyhelminthes, so are among the lowest invertebrates to possess three embryonic germ layers—endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. In addition, they have a head region that contains concentrated sense organs and nervous tissue (brain).

Like all ectoparasites, monogeneans have well-developed attachment structures. The anterior structures are collectively termed the prohaptor, while the posterior ones are collectively termed the opisthaptor, or simply haptor. The posterior opisthaptor with its hooks, anchors, clamps etc. is typically the major attachment organ.

Generally, monogeneans also are hermaphroditic with functional reproductive organs of both sexes occurring in one individual. Most species are oviparous, but a few are viviparous.

==Phylogeny==
The following cladogram depicts the phylogenetic relationships of the different monogenean orders:
==Systematics and evolution==
The ancestors of Monogenea were probably free-living flatworms similar to modern Turbellaria.
According to the more widely accepted view, &quot;rhabdocoel turbellarians gave rise to monogeneans; these, in turn, gave rise to digeneans, from which the cestodes were derived. Another view is that the rhabdocoel ancestor gave rise to two lines; one gave rise to monogeneans, which gave rise to digeneans, and the other line gave rise to cestodes&quot;.

About 50 families and thousands of species are described.

Some parasitologists divide the Monogenea into two (or three) subclasses based on the complexity of their haptor: the Monopisthocotylea have one main part to the haptor, often with hooks or a large attachment disc, whereas the Polyopisthocotylea have multiple parts to the haptor, typically clamps. These groups are also known as Polyonchoinea and Heteronchoinea, respectively. Polyopisthocotyleans are almost exclusively gill-dwelling blood feeders, whereas monopisthocotyleans may live on the gills, skin, and fins.

Monopisthocotylea include:
*Genus &quot;Gyrodactylus&quot; has no eyespots and is viviparous.
*Genus &quot;Dactylogyrus&quot; has four eyespots and is oviparous. This is one of the largest metazoan genera, with at least 970 species.
*Genus &quot;Neobenedenia&quot; much larger and lives on the skin of many tropical marine species, causing problematic infections in marine aquaria.
All of these can cause epizootics in freshwater fish when raised in aquaculture.

Polyopisthocotylea include:
*Genus &quot;Diclidophora&quot; is primarily found in marine fish and primitive freshwater fish such as sturgeons and paddlefish.
*Genus &quot;Protopolystoma&quot; is found in aquatic clawed toads (&quot;Xenopus&quot; species).

==Ecology and lifecycle==

Monogeneans possess the simplest lifecycle among the parasitic platyhelminths. They have no intermediate hosts and are ectoparasitic on fish (seldom in the urinary bladder and rectum of cold-blooded vertebrates). Although they are hermaphrodites, the male reproductive system becomes functional before the female part. The eggs hatch releasing a heavily ciliated larval stage known as an oncomiracidium. The oncomiracidium has numerous posterior hooks and is generally the life stage responsible for transmission from host to host.
No known monogeneans infect birds, but one (&quot;Oculotrema hippopotami&quot;) infects mammals, parasitizing the eye of the hippopotamus.

<text>Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) was a major European integrated defence electronics company and an equal shares joint venture between BAE Systems and Finmeccanica (now Leonardo S.p.A.) until its dissolution on 3 May 2005.

AMS was formed in 1998 by the merger of GEC-Marconi Radar and Defence Systems and Alenia Difesa. Equal shares in the resulting company were then held by Finmeccanica, and GEC-Marconi (later Marconi Electronic Systems (MES)), a division of The General Electric Company (GEC).

With the demerger and subsequent sale of its MES division in 1999, GEC&#x27;s interest in AMS passed to BAE Systems.

In 2001 AMS&#x27; missile systems division was merged with Aerospatiale Matra Missiles and Matra BAe Dynamics to form MBDA.

On 7 October 2003 the UK holding company for AMS changed its registered name from Alenia Marconi Systems Limited to AMS Limited to comply with the agreements reached regarding use of the name &quot;Marconi&quot; following the sale of Marconi Electronic Systems by GEC (later Marconi plc). This name change was reflected in rebranding across the company, although the Italian holding company retained the name Alenia Marconi Systems SpA.

On 28 January 2005 BAE Systems and Finmeccanica announced the intention to dissolve their partnership in the AMS joint venture with AMS&#x27; UK and Italian operations taken over by the respective partners as arranged through the Eurosystems Transaction. On 3 May 2005 the Eurosystems Transaction was finalised:
*The UK operations of AMS (minus air traffic control and communication systems) brought together with the C4ISR division of BAE Systems (minus communication systems) to form the new BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies (Insyte) division of BAE Systems.
*The Italian operations of AMS (Alenia Marconi Systems SpA) became SELEX Sistemi Integrati which in turn became Selex ES in January 2013.

<text>Brinklow is a village and civil parish in the Rugby district of Warwickshire, England. It is about halfway between Rugby and Coventry. The parish had a population of 1,120 at the 2021 Census.

Brinklow is an ancient settlement located on the Fosse Way former roman road, it is most well known for the large earthwork remains of Brinklow Castle.
==History==
The village likely has ancient origins as there was a pre-Roman burial mound located here, which the Romans diverted their Fosse Way road around. The mound later became a Norman motte-and-bailey castle (Brinklow Castle, known locally as The Tump or the Big Hill), which is one of the largest and best preserved of its type in England.

Brinklow was not mentioned in the Domesday Book, as it was likely founded as a market town in 1218, when it was granted a market charter, however the market had died out long before the 19th century.

The village church of St John the Baptist is the one of the oldest buildings in the village, dating from the 13th century; it was built by monks from Kenilworth Abbey, and the first record of a priest here was from 1252. The church was partly rebuilt in the 15th century, but incorporating parts of the earlier church.

The village thrived in part due to the nearby great houses of Coombe Abbey and Newbold Revel, and the trades of candlemaking, basket weaving and silk manufacture all took place in the village. 

The Oxford Canal was opened through the village in 1790, and this brought extra prosperity to the village, although it was later straightened out in the 1830s, and the new course bypassed Brinklow to the east, although a stretch of the old route remained open as an arm of the canal serving the village.

Between 1847 and 1957, Brinklow had its own railway station on the Trent Valley Line, located around one mile to the north of the village.

The village formerly had a primary school, but this was closed in 1996.

At one time there were four public houses in the village; The Raven, the White Lion, the Dun Cow and the Bull&#x27;s Head.

==Governance==
Brinklow is governed by Brinklow Parish Council, which consists of six councillors. They launched a redeveloped website in 2011.

<doc id="795391" wikidata="Q8557400" url="?curid=795391" title="Newhall Pass">
<text>Newhall Pass is a low mountain pass in Los Angeles County, California. Historically called Fremont Pass and San Fernando Pass, with Beale&#x27;s Cut, it separates the Santa Susana Mountains from the San Gabriel Mountains. Although the pass was visited in August 1769 by Catalan explorer Gaspar de Portolá, it eventually was named for Henry Newhall, a significant businessman in the area during the 19th century.

Newhall Pass links the San Fernando Valley to the Santa Clarita Valley and is a main entry to the Greater Los Angeles area. The pass is known for the massive Newhall Pass interchange and the historic San Fernando Tunnel.

Weather conditions in the pass can vary from triple-digit heat in the summer to rare below freezing temperatures in winter. Snow is possible from December to February, but is quite uncommon; when it does occur, it can lead to heavy traffic and accidents. The pass also is susceptible to heavy flooding during La Niña and El Niño events. Wildfires have also occasionally closed down the pass and California State Route 14.

==History==
Newhall Pass was initially named &#x27;Fremont Pass&#x27; for General John C. Frémont, who was thought to have passed through it in 1847 on his way to sign the Treaty of Cahuenga, but he actually went slightly east of the pass on the El Camino Viejo.

===Lyons Station===
In 1853, a Los Angeles businessman, Henry Clay Wiley, installed a windlass atop the Fremont Pass to speed and ease the ascent and descent of the steep Santa Clara Divide. He also built a tavern, hotel and stable nearby. In 1854, Wiley sold out to Sanford and Cyrus Lyon and it began to be called Lyons Station. At the same time, Phineas Banning obtained the business of supplying Fort Tejon.

===Beale&#x27;s Cut===
The steep pass was made easier to cross when a deep slot-like road was cut through the &quot;San Fernando Mountain&quot; by Charles H. Brindley, Andrés Pico, and James R. Vineyard. In return for helping tame the most daunting obstacle along the Fort Tejon Road, the main inland route from Los Angeles to the north, the State of California awarded them a twenty-year contract to maintain the turnpike and collect tolls. Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach that operated mail between St. Louis, Missouri, and San Francisco, began using it directly.

In 1861, a landowner and surveyor named Edward Beale was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as the federal Surveyor General of California and Nevada. Beale challenged General Pico&#x27;s loyalty to the new president and in 1863, Beale was awarded the right to collect the toll in the pass. Beale maintained rights to the cut for the next twenty years and so it became known as &quot;Beale&#x27;s Cut.&quot;

Beale&#x27;s Cut was eventually deepened to . It lasted as a transportation passage in the neighborhood of present-day Newhall Pass until construction of the Newhall Tunnel was completed in 1910.

Beale&#x27;s Cut appeared in many silent western movies. The location became a favorite of movie producers like John Ford and D. W. Griffith. In Ford&#x27;s 1923 film &quot;Three Jumps Ahead&quot;, American cowboy star Tom Mix is filmed jumping over the pass, although it has been widely debated among film historians whether Mix himself made the jump, with any of a number of stuntmen claiming credit for it while some experts believe the jump was achieved purely through special effects. John Ford used the location in at least four films over a twenty-year period beginning as early as 1917.

Still in existence today, it is no longer passable by automobiles. It suffered a partial collapse during the Northridge Earthquake, on January 17, 1994, and now is about deep. It is visible from the Sierra Highway about one mile north from the intersection of The Old Road and Sierra Highway, just after the first bridge under SR 14. It lies between Sierra Highway and the new freeway, about a quarter mile to the northeast of a stone marker. Beale&#x27;s Cut is difficult to find today because it is fenced off and not close enough to the Sierra Highway to be easily seen.

===Newhall Pass===
In 1910, the Newhall Auto Tunnel was built by Los Angeles County a quarter-mile northwest of Beale&#x27;s Cut. However, two-way traffic through the tunnel was slow because it was only wide.

The California Division of Highways decided to replace the tunnel. In July 1938, work started to remove the rock above the tunnel to create a four-lane highway. The road was first known as Highway 6, then Highway 14, and finally the present-day Sierra Highway. The cut for the tunnel is located to the west of today&#x27;s Highway 14, and east of Gates King Open Space.

The pass is named after the local businessman Henry Newhall, whose land holdings formed the basis of the city of Santa Clarita. Newhall came to California from Saugus, Massachusetts during the California Gold Rush in 1850. Over time he purchased a number of properties in the state, the most significant being the Rancho San Francisco in northern Los Angeles County. Within this territory, he granted a right-of-way to Southern Pacific through what is now Newhall Pass, and he also sold them a portion of the land, upon which the company built a town they named after him: Newhall. The first station built on the line he named for his hometown, Saugus. After his death in 1882 his family incorporated the Newhall Land and Farming Company.

Newhall Pass remains a main traffic route, as the Newhall Pass interchange of Interstate 5 (Golden State Freeway) and State Route 14 (Antelope Valley Freeway), as well as Sierra Highway, Foothill Boulevard, and San Fernando Road travel through the pass.

===San Fernando Tunnel===
The was begun in March 1875 and took a year and a half to complete. Over 1,500 mostly Chinese laborers took part in its construction, which began at the south end of the mountain. Many of them had prior experience working on Southern Pacific&#x27;s tunnels in the Tehachapi Pass. Due to the sandstone composition of the mountain that was saturated with water and oil, frequent cave-ins occurred and the bore had to be constantly shored up by timbers during excavation.

The initial location for the north end of the tunnel was near Lyons Station Stagecoach Stop, which was abandoned due to frequent cave-ins caused by oil-soaked rock. The north end was moved a little further west towards the present town of Newhall, California. The north end of the tunnel excavation commenced in June 1875. Water was a constant problem during construction and pumps were utilized to keep the tunnel from flooding. Workers digging from both the north and south ends of the tunnel came face to face on July 14, 1876. The bores from each end were only a half inch out of line with dimensions of high, wide at the bottom and over at the shoulders. Track was laid in place during the tunnel dig and was used to remove dirt and rock by horse-pulled cars. The first train passed through the tunnel on August 12, 1876. On September 4 Charles Crocker notified Southern Pacific that the track had been completed on the route between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Metrolink&#x27;s Antelope Valley Line and the Union Pacific Railroad (formerly the Southern Pacific Transportation Company) go through the Tejon pass via the San Fernando Tunnel.

<doc id="795403" wikidata="Q81102410" url="?curid=795403" title="Messier 81">
<text>Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode&#x27;s Galaxy) is a grand design spiral galaxy about 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It has a D25 isophotal diameter of . Because of its relative proximity to the Milky Way galaxy, large size, and active galactic nucleus (which harbors a 70 million 
supermassive black hole), Messier 81 has been studied extensively by professional astronomers. The galaxy&#x27;s large size and relatively high brightness also makes it a popular target for amateur astronomers. In late February 2022, astronomers reported that M81 may be the source of FRB 20200120E, a repeating fast radio burst.

== Discovery ==
Messier 81 was first discovered by Johann Elert Bode on 31 December 1774. Thus, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Bode&#x27;s Galaxy&quot;. In 1779, Pierre Méchain and Charles Messier reidentified Bode&#x27;s object, hence listed it in the Messier Catalogue.

== Visibility ==

The galaxy is to be found approximately 10° northwest of Alpha Ursae Majoris (Dubhe) along with several other galaxies in the Messier 81 Group. Its apparent magnitude due to its distance means it requires a good night sky and only rises very briefly and extremely low at its southernmost limit from Earth&#x27;s surface, about the 20th parallel south.

Messier 81 and Messier 82 are considered ideal for viewing using binoculars and small telescopes. The two objects are generally not observable to the unaided eye, although highly experienced amateur astronomers may be able to see Messier 81 under exceptional observing conditions with a very dark sky. Telescopes with apertures of or larger are needed to distinguish structures in the galaxy.

 The galaxy is best observed during April.

== Interstellar dust ==
Most of the emission at infrared wavelengths originates from interstellar dust. This interstellar dust is found primarily within the galaxy&#x27;s spiral arms, and it has been shown to be associated with star formation regions. The general explanation is that the hot, short-lived blue stars that are found within star formation regions are very effective at heating the dust and thus enhancing the infrared dust emission from these regions.

== Globular clusters ==
It is estimated M81 has 210 ± 30 globular clusters. In late February 2022, astronomers reported that M81 may be the source of FRB 20200120E, a repeating fast radio burst.

== Supernovae ==
Only one supernova has been detected in Messier 81. The supernova, named SN 1993J, was discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. García in Spain. At the time, it was the second brightest type II supernova observed in the 20th century, peaking at an apparent magnitude of 10.7. The spectral characteristics of the supernova changed over time. Initially, it looked more like a type II supernova (a supernova formed by the explosion of a supergiant star) with strong hydrogen spectral line emission, but later the hydrogen lines faded and strong helium spectral lines appeared, making the supernova look more like a type Ib.

Moreover, the variations in SN 1993J&#x27;s luminosity over time were not like the variations observed in other type II supernovae, but did resemble the variations observed in type Ib supernovae. Hence, the supernova has been classified as a type IIb, a transitory class between type II and type Ib. The scientific results from this supernova suggested that type Ib and Ic supernovae were formed through the explosions of giant stars through processes similar to those taking place in type II supernovae. Despite the uncertainties in modeling the unusual supernova, it was also used to estimate a very approximate distance of 8.5 ± 1.3 Mly (2.6 ± 0.4 Mpc) to Messier 81. As a local galaxy, the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) tracks novae in M81 along with M31 and M33.

==SMBH==
In the center of M81 there exists a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a mass of about . The SMBH is active, having an accretion disk and one-sided relativistic jet. The observation also demonstrate that there may exist a second SMBH that orbits the primary SMBH with a period of around 30 years. The mass of the secondary SMBH is estimated at 0.1 of the primary.

== Environment ==
Messier 81 is the largest galaxy in the M81 Group, a group of 34 in the constellation Ursa Major. At approximately 11.7 Mly (3.6 Mpc) from the Earth, it makes this group and the Local Group, containing the Milky Way, relative neighbors in the Virgo Supercluster.

Gravitational interactions of M81 with M82 and NGC 3077 have stripped hydrogen gas away from all three galaxies, forming gaseous filamentary structures in the group. Moreover, these interactions have allowed interstellar gas to fall into the centers of M82 and NGC 3077, leading to vigorous star formation or starburst activity there.

== Distance ==
The distance to Messier 81 has been measured by Freedman et al to be 3.63 ± 0.34 Megaparsecs (11.8 ± 1.1 million light years) by using the Hubble Space Telescope to identify classical Cepheid variables and measure their periods using the period-luminosity relation discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt.

<text>The Lipizzan or Lipizzaner (, , , , , , ) is a European breed of riding horse developed in the Habsburg Empire in the sixteenth century. It is of Baroque type, and is powerful, slow to mature and long-lived; the coat is usually gray. 

The name of the breed derives from that of the village of Lipica (), which was part of the Habsburg empire at the time the breed was developed, now in Slovenia, one of the earliest stud farms established; the stud farm there is still active. The breed has been endangered numerous times by warfare sweeping Europe, including during the War of the First Coalition, World War I, and World War II. The rescue of the Lipizzans during World War II by American troops was made famous by the Disney movie &quot;Miracle of the White Stallions&quot;. 

The Lipizzaner is closely associated with the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, Austria, where the horses demonstrate the &quot;haute école&quot; or &quot;high school&quot; movements of classical dressage, including the highly controlled, stylized jumps and other movements known as the &quot;airs above the ground&quot;. These horses are mostly bred at the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, and are trained using traditional methods of classical dressage that date back hundreds of years.

Eight stallions are recognized as the classic foundation bloodstock of the breed, all foaled in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to these eight stallions, and all breeding stallions have included in their name the name of the foundation sire of their bloodline. Also classic mare lines are known, with up to 35 recognized by various breed registries. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. Most Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, South Africa, and Australia.

Lipizzan horse breeding traditions are recognized by UNESCO and inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

==Characteristics==
Most adult Lipizzans measure between . However, horses bred to be closer to the original carriage-horse type are taller, approaching . Lipizzans have a long head, with a straight or slightly convex profile. The jaw is deep, the ears small, the eyes large and expressive, and the nostrils flared. They have a neck that is sturdy, yet arched and withers that are low, muscular, and broad. They are a Baroque horse, with a wide, deep chest, broad croup, and muscular shoulder. The tail is carried high and well set. The legs are well-muscled and strong, with broad joints and well-defined tendons. The feet tend to be small, but are tough.

Lipizzan horses tend to mature slowly. However, they live and are active longer than many other breeds, with horses performing the difficult exercises of the Spanish Riding School well into their 20s and living into their 30s.

===Color===
Aside from the rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a white hair coat. Gray horses, including Lipizzans, are born with a pigmented coat—in Lipizzans, foals are usually bay or black—and become lighter each year as the graying process takes place, with the process being complete between 6 and 10 years of age. Lipizzans are not actually true white horses, but this is a common misconception. A white horse is born white and has unpigmented skin.

Until the eighteenth century, Lipizzans had other coat colors, including dun, bay, chestnut, black, piebald, and skewbald. However, gray is a dominant gene. Gray was the color preferred by the royal family, so the color was emphasized in breeding practices. Thus, in a small breed population when the color was deliberately selected as a desirable feature, it came to be the color of the overwhelming majority of Lipizzan horses. However, it is a long-standing tradition for the Spanish Riding School to have at least one bay Lipizzan stallion in residence, and this tradition is continued through the present day.

==History==
The ancestors of the Lipizzan can be traced to around 800 AD. The earliest predecessors of the Lipizzan originated in the seventh century when Barb horses were brought into Spain by the Moors and crossed on native Spanish stock. The result was the Andalusian horse and other Iberian horse breeds.

By the sixteenth century, when the Habsburgs ruled both Spain and Austria, a powerful but agile horse was desired both for military uses and for use in the fashionable and rapidly growing riding schools for the nobility of central Europe. Therefore, in 1562, the Habsburg Emperor Maximillian II brought the Spanish Andalusian horse to Austria and founded the court stud at Kladrub. In 1580, his brother, Archduke Charles II, ruler of Inner Austria, established a similar stud at Lipizza (now Lipica), located in modern-day Slovenia, from which the breed obtained its name. When the stud farm was established, Lipizza was located within the municipal limits of Trieste, an autonomous city under Habsburg sovereignty. The name of the village itself derives from the Slovene word &quot;lipa&quot;, meaning &quot;linden tree.&quot;

Spanish, Barb, and Arabian stock were crossed at Lipizza, and succeeding generations were crossed with the Neapolitan breed from Italy and other Baroque horses of Spanish descent obtained from Germany and Denmark. While breeding stock was exchanged between the two studs, Kladrub specialized in producing heavy carriage horses, while riding and light carriage horses came from the Lipizza stud.

Beginning in 1920, the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, became the main stud for the horses used in Vienna. Breeding became very selective, allowing only stallions that had proved themselves at the Riding School to stand at stud, and breeding only mares that had passed rigorous performance testing.

===Foundation horses===

Today, eight foundation lines for Lipizzans are recognized by various registries, which refer to them as &quot;dynasties&quot;. They are divided into two groups. Six trace to classical foundation stallions used in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by the Lipizza stud, and two additional lines were not used at Lipizza, but were used by other studs within the historic boundaries of the Habsburg Empire.

The six &quot;classical dynasties&quot; are:
* Pluto: a gray Spanish stallion from the Royal Danish Stud, foaled in 1765
* Conversano: a black Neapolitan stallion, foaled in 1767
* Maestoso: a gray stallion from the Kladrub stud with a Spanish dam, foaled 1773, descendants today all trace via Maestoso X, foaled in Hungary in 1819
* Favory: a dun stallion from the Kladrub stud, foaled in 1779
* Neapolitano: a bay Neapolitan stallion from the Polesine, foaled in 1790
* Siglavy: a gray Arabian stallion, originally from Syria, foaled in 1810

Two additional stallion lines are found in Croatia, Hungary, and other eastern European countries, as well as in North America. They are accepted as equal to the six classical lines by the Lipizzan International Federation. These are:
* Tulipan: A black stallion of Baroque type and Spanish pedigree foaled about 1800 from the Croatian stud farm of Terezovac, owned by Count Janković-Bésán. 
*Incitato: A stallion of Spanish lines foaled 1802, bred in Transylvania by Count Bethlen, and sold to the Hungarian stud farm Mezőhegyes

Several other stallion lines have died out over the years, but were used in the early breeding of the horses. In addition to the foundation stallion lines, there were 20 &quot;classic&quot; mare lines, 14 of which exist today. However, up to 35 mare lines are recognized by various Lipizzan organizations.

Traditional naming patterns are used for both stallions and mares, required by Lipizzan breed registries. Stallions traditionally are given two names, with the first being the line of the sire and the second being the name of the dam. For example, &quot;Maestoso Austria&quot; is a horse sired by Maestoso Trompeta out of a mare named Austria. The horse&#x27;s sire line traces to the foundation sire Maestoso. The names of mares are chosen to be &quot;complementary to the traditional Lipizzan line names&quot; and are required to end in the letter &quot;a&quot;.

===Spanish Riding School===

The Spanish Riding School uses highly trained Lipizzan stallions in public performances that demonstrate classical dressage movements and training. In 1572, the first Spanish riding hall was built, during the Austrian Empire, and is the oldest of its kind in the world. The Spanish Riding School, though located in Vienna, Austria, takes its name from the original Spanish heritage of its horses. In 1729, Charles VI commissioned the building of the Winter Riding School in Vienna and in 1735, the building was completed that remains the home of the Spanish Riding School today.

===Wartime preservation===

The Lipizzans endured several wartime relocations throughout their history, each of which saved the breed from extinction. The first was in March 1797 during the War of the First Coalition, when the horses were evacuated from Lipica. During the journey, 16 mares gave birth to foals. In November 1797, the horses returned to Lipica, but the stables were in ruins. They were rebuilt, but in 1805, the horses were evacuated again when Napoleon invaded Austria. They were being taken care of in Đakovo Stud. They remained away from the stud for two years, returning April 1, 1807, but then, following the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809, the horses were evacuated three more times during the unsettled period that followed, resulting in the loss of many horses and the destruction of the written studbooks that documented bloodlines of horses prior to 1700. The horses finally returned to Lipica for good in 1815, where they remained for the rest of the nineteenth century.

The first evacuation of the twentieth century occurred in 1915 when the horses were evacuated from Lipica due to World War I and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub. Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica becoming part of Italy. Thus, the animals were divided between several different studs in the new postwar nations of Austria, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The nation of Austria kept the stallions of the Spanish Riding School and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding stock was consolidated at Piber.

During World War II, the high command of Nazi Germany transferred most of Europe&#x27;s Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock was taken from Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria, from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared the city and the head of the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared the horses were in danger. By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were threatened by the advancing Soviet army, which might have slaughtered the animals for horse meat had it captured the facility.

The rescue of the Lipizzans by the United States Army, made famous by the Disney movie &quot;Miracle of the White Stallions&quot;, occurred in two parts: The Third United States Army, under the command of General George S. Patton, was near St. Martins in the spring of 1945 and learned that the Lipizzan stallions were in the area. Patton himself was a horseman, and like Podhajsky, had competed in the Olympic Games. On May 7, 1945, Podhajsky put on an exhibition of the Spanish Riding School stallions for Patton and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson, and at its conclusion requested that Patton take the horses under his protection.

Meanwhile, the Third Army&#x27;s United States Second Cavalry, a tank unit under the command of Colonel Charles Reed, had discovered the horses at Hostau, where 400 Allied prisoners of war were also being kept, and had occupied it on April 28, 1945. &quot;Operation Cowboy&quot;, as the rescue was known, resulted in the recovery of 1,200 horses, including 375 Lipizzans. Patton learned of the raid, and arranged for Podhajsky to fly to Hostau. On May 12, American soldiers began riding, trucking, and herding the horses 35 miles across the border into Kotztinz, Germany. The Lipizzans were eventually settled in temporary quarters in Wimsbach, until the breeding stock returned to Piber in 1952, and the stallions returned to the Spanish Riding School in 1955. In 2005, the Spanish Riding School celebrated the 60th anniversary of Patton&#x27;s rescue by touring the United States.

During the Croatian War of Independence, from 1991 to 1995, the horses at the Lipik stable in Croatia were taken by the Serbs to Novi Sad, Serbia. The horses remained there until 2007, when calls began to be made for them to be returned to their country of origin. In October 2007, 60 horses were returned to Croatia.

===Modern breed===

The Lipizzan breed suffered a setback to its population when a viral epidemic hit the Piber Stud in 1983. Forty horses and 8% of the expected foal crop were lost. Since then, the population at the stud has increased. By 1994, 100 mares were at the stud farm and a foal crop of 56 was born in 1993. In 1994, the rate of successful pregnancy and birth of foals increased from 27 to 82%; the result of a new veterinary center. In 1996, a study funded by the European Union Indo-Copernicus Project assessed 586 Lipizzan horses from eight stud farms in Europe, with the goal of developing a &quot;scientifically based description of the Lipizzan horse&quot;. A study of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was performed on 212 of the animals, and those studied were found to contain 37 of the 39 known mtDNA haplotypes known in modern horses, meaning that they show a high degree of genetic diversity. This had been expected, as it was known that the mare families of the Lipizzan included a large number of different breeds, including Arabians, Thoroughbreds, and other European breeds.
The Lipizzan International Federation (LIF) is the international governing organization for the breed, composed of many national and private organizations representing the Lipizzan. The organizations work together under the banner of the LIF to promote the breed and maintain standards. As of 2012, almost 11,000 Lipizzans were registered with the LIF; residing with private breeders in 19 countries and at nine state studs in Europe. The largest number are in Europe, with almost 9,000 registered horses, followed by the Americas, with just over 1,700, then Africa and Australia with around 100 horses each. The nine state studs that are part of the LIF represent almost one-quarter of the horses in Europe. Sâmbăta de Jos, in Romania, has the greatest number of horses, with 400, followed by Piber in Austria (360), Lipica in Slovenia (358), Szilvásvárad in Hungary (262), Monterotondo in Italy (230), Đakovo-Lipik in Croatia (220), and Topoľčianky in Slovakia (200). The other two studs are smaller, with stud Vučijak in Bosnia near Prnjavor having 130 horses and Karađorđevo in Serbia having just 30. Educational programs have been developed to promote the breed and foster adherence to traditional breeding objectives.

Because of the status of Lipizzans as the only breed of horse developed in Slovenia, via the Lipica Stud Farm that is now located within its borders, Lipizzans are recognized in Slovenia as a national animal. For example, a pair of Lipizzans is featured on the 20-cent Slovenian euro coins. Mounted regiments of Carabinieri police in Italy also employ the Lipizzan as one of their mounts. In October 2008, during a visit to Slovenia, a Lipizzan at Lipica, named 085 Favory Canissa XXII, was given to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. She decided to leave the animal in the care of the stud farm.

==== Heritage of humanity list ====

On the initiative of Slovenian Ministry of Culture, the tradition of breeding and maintaining a purebred Lipizzaner is recognized by UNESCO and inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity as &quot;Lipizzan horse breeding traditions&quot; since 2022. Inscriptions include state parties Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.

==Training and uses==
The traditional horse training methods for Lipizzans were developed at the Spanish Riding School and are based on the principles of classical dressage, which in turn traces to the Ancient Greek writer Xenophon, whose works were rediscovered in the sixteenth century. His thoughts on development of horses&#x27; mental attitude and psyche are still considered applicable today. Other writers who strongly influenced the training methods of the Spanish Riding School include Federico Grisone, the founder of the first riding academy in Naples, who lived during the sixteenth century, and Antoine de Pluvinel and François Robichon de la Guérinière, two Frenchmen from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The methods for training the Lipizzan stallions at the Spanish Riding School were passed down via an oral tradition until Field Marshal Franz Holbein and Johann Meixner, Senior Rider at the School, published the initial guidelines for the training of horse and rider at the school in 1898. In the mid-twentieth century, Alois Podhajsky wrote a number of works that serve as textbooks for many dressage riders today.

The principles taught at the Spanish Riding School are based on practices taught to cavalry riders to prepare their horses for warfare. Young stallions come to the Spanish Riding School for training when they are four years old. Full training takes an average of six years for each horse, and schooling is considered complete when they have mastered the skills required to perform the &quot;School Quadrille&quot;. There are three progressively more difficult skill sets taught to the stallions, which are:
* Forward riding, also called straight riding or the &quot;Remontenschule&quot;, is the name given to the skills taught in the first year of training, where a young horse learns to be saddled and bridled, learns basic commands on a longe line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the rider&#x27;s legs and hands while mounted. The main goal during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.
* Campaign school, &quot;Campagneschule&quot; or &quot;Campagne&quot;, is where the horse learns collection and balance through all gaits, turns, and maneuvers. The horse learns to shorten and lengthen his stride and perform lateral movements to the side, and is introduced to the more complex double bridle. This is the longest training phase and may take several years.
* High-school dressage, the &quot;haute école&quot; or &quot;Hohe Schule&quot;, includes riding the horse with greater collection with increased use of the hindquarters, developing increased regularity, skill, and finesse in all natural gaits. In this period, the horse learns the most advanced movements such as the half-pass, counter-canter, flying change, pirouette, &quot;passage&quot;, and &quot;piaffe&quot;. This is also when the horse may be taught the &quot;airs above the ground.&quot; This level emphasizes performance with a high degree of perfection.
Although the Piber Stud trains mares for driving and under saddle, the Spanish Riding School exclusively uses stallions in its performances. Worldwide, the Lipizzan today competes in dressage and driving, as well as retaining their classic position at the Spanish Riding School.

==&quot;Airs above the ground&quot;==

The &quot;airs above the ground&quot; are the difficult &quot;high school&quot; dressage movements made famous by the Lipizzans. The finished movements include:
* The levade is a position wherein the horse raises up both front legs, standing at a 30° angle entirely on its hind legs in a controlled form that requires a great deal of hindquarter strength. A less difficult but related movement is the pesade, where the horse rises up to a 45° angle.
* The courbette is a movement where the horse balances on its hind legs and then essentially &quot;hops&quot;, jumping with the front legs off the ground and hind legs together.
* The capriole is a jump in place where the stallion leaps into the air, tucking his forelegs under himself, and kicks out with his hind legs at the top of the jump.
Other movements include:
* The croupade and ballotade are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, the horse jumps with both front and hind legs remaining tucked under the body and he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks his hind legs slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.
* The mezair is a series of successive levades in which the horse lowers its forefeet to the ground before rising again on hindquarters, achieving forward motion. This movement is no longer used at the Spanish Riding School.

==In popular culture==

Lipizzans have starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books, and other media.

The 1940 film &quot;Florian&quot; stars two Lipizzan stallions. It was based on a 1934 novel by Felix Salten. The wife of the film&#x27;s producer owned the only Lipizzans in the US at the time the movie was made. The rescue during World War II of the Lipizzan stallions is depicted in the 1963 Walt Disney movie &quot;Miracle of the White Stallions&quot;. The movie was the only live-action, relatively realistic film set against a World War II backdrop that Disney has ever produced.

Television programs featuring the Lipizzans include &quot;The White Horses&quot;, a 1965 children&#x27;s television series co-produced by RTV Ljubljana (now RTV Slovenija) of Yugoslavia and BR-TV of Germany, rebroadcast in the United Kingdom. It followed the adventures of a teenaged girl who visits a farm where Lipizzan horses are raised.

<text>Episode Six were an English rock band formed in Harrow, London in 1965. The band did not have commercial success in the UK, releasing nine singles that all failed to chart, but they did find minor success in Beirut at the time. Group members Ian Gillan and Roger Glover left in 1969 to join Deep Purple, while drummer Mick Underwood founded Quatermass and later collaborated with Gillan.

==Career==
The band was formed in Hatch End, then in Middlesex, in July 1964 from two local bands, The Lightnings and the Madisons, who had all met at Harrow County School. The original line-up consisted of Glover on bass, Andy Ross on vocals, siblings Sheila Carter-Dimmock on keyboards and vocals and Graham Carter-Dimmock on guitar and vocals, with guitarist Tony Lander and drummer Harvey Shield. The band initially rehearsed at the Carter-Dimmocks&#x27; family house, and initial influences came from The Beach Boys, The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and The Beatles.

By 1965, the band had signed a management deal with Gloria Bristow, a former employee of Helmut Gordon, original manager of what became The Who. In April of that year, the band were offered a short residency at the Arcadia Club in Frankfurt, Germany, playing from 7pm to 3am every night for a month, with only 15 minutes break every hour. Immediately on their return, Ross decided to get married and quit the music business, and consequently Bristow recommended Gillan as a replacement. Shortly afterwards, they signed a deal with the Dick Katz / Harold Davidson Ltd agency, though the band had difficulty finding regular work through this, feeling that the agency&#x27;s attention was being diverted towards other bands. By the end of the year, however, they managed to land a deal with Pye Records They were doing an average of twenty shows a month from July &#x27;65 onwards and cut their first single, The Hollies&#x27; &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; before the end of the year. It was released in early 1966.

The band were booked by Radio London to appear at one of their big open-air summer shows in May 1966 alongside David Bowie and issued more singles during the year, all of which failed to chart. In September 1966 the group played on the Dusty Springfield package tour and did a weekly residency at the Marquee Club during October. There was also the first solo single from Sheila; &quot;I Will Warm Your Heart&quot; in November 1966. Due to financial difficulties, and lack of chart success, the band were forced to do a long Christmas season in Beirut (where they had topped the local chart with a cover of Tim Rose&#x27;s &quot;Morning Dew&quot;) through December and January.

The group had by now built up an impressive repertoire of covers and originals and would vary their sets according to the audiences. They were also beginning to do sessions for the BBC. They did a mini tour of London parks (organised by the Greater London Council) in mid-June 1967, performing two 45-minute sets, and played for four weeks in Germany. On their return Shield left the group due to ill health, and was replaced by John Kerrison (born 1947), who had previously played in The Pirates with future Deep Purple member Nick Simper.

The group got a new record deal with MGM Records and shortened their name to The Episode, releasing &quot;Little One&quot; in May 1968 (their only single under the new name). They did three UK TV shows to promote this and recorded dozens of tracks for radio sessions over the year, including the new Radio 1 Club. However they were not getting along with their new drummer (Gillan subsequently referred to him as &quot;a character and a half&quot;), who was eventually fired, replaced by ex-Outlaws drummer Mick Underwood.

The group left MGM and signed with Chapter One records, releasing &#x27;Lucky Sunday&#x27; in September 1968, which became their eighth single to fail to chart in the UK. Gillan hated the brass section on the record. &quot;Mozart Vs The Rest&quot; followed in February 1969. This was issued in response to hundreds of calls to BBC Radio 1 after the band performed it on air. Sadly this happened too late for it to chart. They also contributed &quot;Gentlemen of the Park&quot; to the soundtrack of the 1968 short film &quot;Les Bicyclettes de Belsize&quot;.

The band decided they needed to update their musical style from the pop-rock they had been playing into a heavier sound, and made a start on a début album but it was never finished. In June 1969 Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord came to see Episode Six play live in London, and then offered Gillan a job in Deep Purple. Glover helped Deep Purple out on a studio session and was also asked to join them. The pair helped Episode Six fulfil existing bookings in the short term, and then quit following their first gig with Deep Purple at the Speakeasy on 10 July.

Episode Six carried on for a time with John Gustafson on bass and vocals. Sheila rehearsed with Pete Robinson, John Gustafson and Mick Underwood as a quartet, before they formed the trio Quatermass. Episode Six then played for a while with Sheila, Tony Lander, Dave Lawson (later of Greenslade) and Tony Dangerfield on bass. By the end of the year they were billed as Episode Six with Sheila Carter and then The Sheila Carter Band, and this continued off and on (mostly with gigs abroad) until 1974 with Sheila as the constant, before she went into session work.

A couple of singles recorded by Episode Six for Pye Records have been produced by Tony Reeves, a renowned bassist and one of founder members of Colosseum.

On 6 December 2015, for their 50th anniversary, the band reunited and performed in front of an audience of family and friends in London.

<doc id="795427" wikidata="Q469134" url="?curid=795427" title="Massimo d'Azeglio">
<text>Massimo Taparelli, Marquess of Azeglio (24 October 1798 – 15 January 1866), commonly called Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio (), was a Piedmontese-Italian statesman, novelist, and painter. He was Prime Minister of Sardinia for almost three years until succeeded by his rival Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour. A moderate liberal and member of the Moderate Party associated with the Historical Right, d&#x27;Azeglio hoped for a federal union between Italian states.

As Prime Minister, d&#x27;Azeglio consolidated the parliamentary system, getting the young King Victor Emmanuel II to accept his constitutional status, and worked hard for a peace treaty with Austria. Although himself a Roman Catholic, he introduced freedom of worship, supported public education, and sought to reduce the power of the clergy in local political affairs. As a senator, following the annexation of the United Provinces of Central Italy, d&#x27;Azeglio attempted to solve the Roman Question through reconciliation between the Vatican and the new Italian Kingdom. His brother was a Jesuit priest.

==Early life==
Massimo Taparelli, Marquis d&#x27;Azeglio, was born in Turin on 24 October 1798. He was descended from an ancient and noble Piedmontese family. His father, Cesare d&#x27;Azeglio, an officer in the Royal Sardinian Army, held a high position at court. On the return of Pope Pius VII to Rome after the abdication of Napoleon, Cesare was sent as special envoy to the Holy See and took his son, then sixteen years of age, with him as an extra attaché. Young Massimo was given a commission in a cavalry regiment, which he soon relinquished on account of his health. During his residence in Rome, Massimo acquired a love for art and music and decided to become a painter, to the horror of his conservative, aristocratic family. His father reluctantly consented, and Massimo settled in Rome, devoting himself to art.

==Early political career==

He led an abstemious life in Rome, maintaining himself by painting Romantic landscapes which frequently included historical subjects. He also painted scenes for a self-composed opera. In 1830 he returned to Turin and, after his father&#x27;s death in 1831, moved to Milan. He resided in Milan for twelve years, moving in the city&#x27;s literary and artistic circles and, in 1834, helped to organise the &quot;Salotto Maffei&quot; salon, hosted by Clara Maffei. He became an intimate of Alessandro Manzoni the novelist, whose daughter he married. At that point, literature instead of art became his chief occupation; he produced two historical novels, &quot;Niccolò dei Lapi&quot; and &quot;Ettore Fieramosca&quot;, in imitation of Walter Scott. The novels had a strong political context, with d&#x27;Azeglio aiming to illustrate the evils of foreign domination in Italy and to reawaken national feeling.

In 1845, d&#x27;Azeglio visited Romagna as an unauthorized political envoy, to report on its conditions and the troubles which he foresaw would break out on the death of Pope Gregory XVI. The following year he published his famous pamphlet &quot;Degli ultimi casi di Romagna&quot; at Florence; as a consequence of this he was expelled from Tuscany. He spent the next few months in Rome, sharing the general enthusiasm over the supposed liberalism of the new pope, Pius IX; like Vincenzo Gioberti he believed in an Italian confederation under papal auspices and was opposed to the Radical wing of the Liberal party. His political activity increased and he wrote various other pamphlets, among which was &quot;I lutti di Lombardia&quot; (1848).

On the outbreak of the First Italian War of Independence, d&#x27;Azeglio donned the Papal uniform and took part under General Giovanni Durando in the defence of Vicenza, where he was severely wounded. He retired to Florence to recover, but as he opposed the ruling democrats he was expelled from Tuscany a second time. He was now a famous man, and early in 1849 King Charles Albert of Sardinia, invited him to form a cabinet. Realizing how impossible it was to renew the campaign, but &quot;not having the heart to sign, in such wretched internal and external conditions, a treaty of peace with Austria&quot; (&quot;&quot;, by E Rendu), he refused.

==Prime Minister of Sardinia==

After the defeat at the Battle of Novara (23 March 1849), Charles Albert abdicated and was succeeded by Victor Emmanuel II. D&#x27;Azeglio was again called on to form a cabinet; this time, although the situation was even more difficult, he accepted, concluded a peace treaty, dissolved the Chamber and summoned a new one to ratify it. The treaty was accepted and d&#x27;Azeglio continued in office for the next three years. While all the rest of Italy was prey to despotism, in Piedmont, the king maintained the constitution intact in the face of a general wave of reaction. D&#x27;Azeglio conducted the country&#x27;s affairs with tact and ability, and improved its diplomatic relations. With his top aide Cavour taking the lead legislation passed weakening the powers of the Church to own land, control the schools and supervise marriage laws. When the bishops protested they were punished or exiled, inspiring liberal anticlerical elements across Italy.

D&#x27;Azeglio invited Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, then a rising young politician, to enter the ministry in 1850. Cavour and Luigi Carlo Farini, also a member of the cabinet, made certain declarations in the Chamber (May 1852) which led the ministry in the direction of an alliance with Urbano Rattazzi and the Left. D&#x27;Azeglio disapproved of this and resigned office, but on the king&#x27;s request formed a new ministry, excluding both Cavour and Farini. In October, however, owing to ill health and dissatisfaction with some of his colleagues, and for other reasons not quite clear, he resigned once more and retired, suggesting to the king that Cavour should be his successor.

==Retirement==

For the next four years he lived modestly at Turin, devoting himself once more to art, although he also continued to take an active interest in politics. Cavour continued to consult him. In 1855 d&#x27;Azeglio was appointed director of the Galleria Sabauda. In 1859 he was given various political missions, including one to Paris and London to prepare the basis for a general congress of the powers on Italian affairs. When war between Piedmont and Austria appeared inevitable, he returned to Italy and was sent by Cavour as royal commissioner to Romagna, whence the papal troops had been expelled.

After the Armistice of Villafranca, d&#x27;Azeglio was recalled with orders to withdraw the Piedmontese garrisons, but saw the danger of allowing papal troops to reoccupy the province, and after a severe struggle left Bologna without the troops and interviewed the king. The latter approved of his action and said that his orders had not been accurately expressed; thus Romagna was saved. That same year d&#x27;Azeglio published a pamphlet in French entitled &quot;De la Politique et du droit chrétien au point de vue de la question italienne&quot;, with the object of inducing Napoleon III to continue his pro-Italian policy. Early in 1860, Cavour appointed him governor of Milan, evacuated by the Austrians after the Battle of Magenta, a position which he held with great ability. However, disapproving of the government&#x27;s policy with regard to Garibaldi&#x27;s Expedition of the Thousand and regarding the occupation by Piedmont of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies as inopportune, he resigned office.

The deaths of his two brothers in 1862 and of Cavour in 1861 caused d&#x27;Azeglio great grief; he subsequently led a comparatively retired life, but continued to take part in politics, both as deputy and writer, his two chief subjects of interest being the Roman question and the relations of Piedmont (now the Kingdom of Italy) with Mazzini and the other revolutionaries. In his opinion Italy needed to be unified using the Franco-Piedmontese army alone, avoiding any connection with the other armies. He continued to hold that the pope should enjoy nominal sovereignty over Rome with full spiritual independence, with the capital of Italy being established elsewhere but the Romans being Italian citizens. He strongly disapproved of the September Convention of 1864 between the Italian government and the pope. The last few years of d&#x27;Azeglio&#x27;s life were spent chiefly at his villa of Cannero, where he wrote his memoirs. He died of fever in Turin on 15 January 1866.

==Role as politician==
D&#x27;Azeglio played a significant role in the rehabilitation of Piedmont after the chaos of the 1848–49 revolutions. He had a low opinion of the people of Italy, who, he declared &quot;were 20 per cent stupid rascally and bold, 80 per cent stupid, honest and timid, and such a people has the government it deserves.&quot; He became Prime Minister in 1849, despite a lack of experience or enthusiasm. Bored by debates in Parliament, he had unexpected strengths: He was honest and clear-sighted, widely admired both at home and abroad, displaying wisdom and moderation that were crucial for consolidating the parliamentary system in his kingdom. He convinced the king to accept constitutional government, with the proviso the King could control military and foreign policy without parliamentary interference.

==Writings and publications==
Besides a variety of newspaper articles and pamphlets, d&#x27;Azeglio&#x27;s chief works are the two novels &quot;Ettore Fieramosca&quot; (1833) and &quot;Niccolò dei Lapi&quot; (1841), as well as a volume of autobiographical memoirs entitled &quot;I Miei Ricordi&quot; (D&#x27;Azeglio Memoirs – p. 1867), a work published after his death, in 1866, but unfortunately incomplete. A quote from his memoirs is &quot;L&#x27;Italia è fatta. Restano da fare gli italiani&quot;, translated colloquially as &quot;We have made Italy. Now we must make Italians.&quot; His landscape paintings influenced Salvatore Mazza and Luigi Riccardi.

==Memory==
A prestigious &quot;Liceo classico&quot; founded in 1831 in his hometown of Turin was later renamed in his honour. The Liceo classico Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio has a notable place in Italian history as the alma mater of author Primo Levi, novelist Cesare Pavese, screenwriter Tullio Pinelli, and anti-fascist intellectuals such as publisher Giulio Einaudi (son of future President Luigi Einaudi), Norberto Bobbio, and writer and teacher Leone Ginzburg. Juventus Football Club was founded by its students in 1897. There is a poetry contest organized by a cultural organization in Puglia (Italian region) named after D&#x27;Azeglio.

<doc id="795456" wikidata="Q5940606" url="?curid=795456" title="Hume Lake">
<text>Hume Lake is a reservoir in the Sierra Nevada, within Sequoia National Forest and Fresno County, central California.

Hume Lake is on Tenmile Creek, which is a tributary of the Kings River, and adjacent to the unincorporated community of Hume.

The surface elevation of the lake is . It is accessible from California Route 180, via Forest Service road 30, and is about east of Fresno, not far from the west entrance to Kings Canyon National Park.

The lake lies behind the world&#x27;s first concrete reinforced multiple arch dam, designed by John S. Eastwood and constructed in 1908 by the Hume-Bennett Lumber Company. During lumber operations, the lake stored logs for an adjacent mill and supplied water for a flume used to transport the cut lumber to Sanger, California.

Since the cessation of logging in 1924, Hume Lake has shifted from primarily industrial use and is now mainly used for recreation.

==History==

===Formation===
The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company was formed in 1905 when Thomas Hume and Ira B. Bennett purchased the Sanger Lumber Company. Little uncut lumber remained in the vicinity of the mill in the Converse Basin so a new location was sought closer to uncut stands of timber. This meant that the company would have to move deeper into the mountains. Tenmile Creek was the next tributary of the Kings River, east of Converse Basin. The creek flowed through an area known as Long Meadow. This location was promising for the company because it could be converted into a reservoir that would serve two functions for the company. First, it would provide storage for logs cut from surrounding virgin groves. From this body of water, floating logs could be drawn into an adjacent mill to be cut. Second, the rough cut lumber could then be transported out of the mountains in a flume filled with water from the reservoir.

To create this reservoir, John S. Eastwood was hired in 1908 to construct a dam at Long Meadow. Eastwood proposed constructing the world&#x27;s first reinforced concrete multiple arch dam. Although unprecedented, at a cost of approximately $46,000, the dam&#x27;s design was a less expensive alternative to a conventional rock fill dam that would have cost about twice as much to construct. The dam was completed in only 114 days, by the end of 1909, along with a mill immediately adjacent to the dam. Logs were dumped into the reservoir by rail and floated to the dam where they were drawn up into the mill, cut and then dried in kilns next to the mill on the west bank of Tenmile Creek. From this location, lumber was floated to Sanger, California, in a flume filled with water from the reservoir. The flume was the longest ever created, eventually stretching from Hume Lake to Sanger. Designed and built by James Carroll Goss, the flume was used by both the lumber company and tourists. Thrill seeking tourists would occasionally ride in the flume down from the Sierras in special boats designed with an open prow so that water would help keep the boats from flying off into the air. The flume was also reputedly utilized in 1893 by the bandit Chris Evans, of the Evans-Sontag Gang of Train Robbers, who hid along the flume to evade capture after escaping from the Fresno County Jail with his accomplice Ed Morrell.

The dam and reservoir survive today little changed from their original appearance in 1908. The dam stands in height and extends in length. The dam is founded on granite bedrock and consists of twelve arches, which are supported by intervening buttresses on the downstream side. The height was set at because of a tract of land &quot;not&quot; owned by Hume-Bennet along the reservoir&#x27;s edge that would have been inundated by water if the dam had been built any higher. The water level was maintained at a level slightly lower than it typically is today, through the use of spillway openings in the dam structure, which have since been filled.

===End of logging===
Hume-Bennett thoroughly harvested the forests surrounding Hume Lake following completion of the dam, but paltry profits and a devastating fire in 1917 led to the end of logging operations. The fire completely destroyed the mill and surrounding facilities, with all logging ceasing by 1924. On April 8, 1935, the United States Forest Service purchased the entire operation and its holdings, including the dam and forest surrounding Hume Lake, incorporating it into the Sequoia National Forest.

=== Dam repairs ===
From 1953 to 1954, the lake was drained for a safety inspection. During the inspection, it was apparent the dam was unfit and the lake would remain empty. The board of Hume Lake Christian Camps approached the California Fish and Game Department suggesting the dam be resurfaced. A six-inch cement coating was applied to the front face of the dam. The repairs were completed in 80 days and the lake was refilled.

== Current use ==
Since its purchase by the Forest Service, Hume Lake has become a popular destination, providing a variety of recreational opportunities:

*Camping at a United States Forest Service campground on the northern shore of the lake. The facility consists of 74 sites among four separate sections located at varying distances from the lake shore.

*Hume Lake Christian Camps is the largest facility at the lake, which traces its origins to 1946, when the founders met in the nearby valley town of Dinuba to discuss plans for a Christian Bible camp. On January 9, 1946, of lake shore property were purchased to create the camp, including the Hume Lake Hotel, store, service station, post office, 22 cottages, and 22 boats. Soon thereafter, in the summer of 1946, 670 campers and 15 volunteer staff attended conferences at Hume Lake. Since that first summer in 1946, more than a million young people and adults have attended the camp for worship, religious studies, and recreation. Activities at the camps include: swimming, disc golf, boating, hiking, biking, paint balling, high ropes course, climbing wall, and a number of recreational games such as Kajabe Kan Kan. Facilities include a dining hall, clothing company, a snack shop, two Hume-n-Beans coffee shops, the Ponderosa Pizza &amp; Pizookie, a post office, a gift shop, a recording studio, swimming pool, beach access with rowboat, paddle board and kayak rentals, several lodges, a security booth, and public washing machines.
*Cabins available for private rental and private cabins owned by full-time and part-time residents
*Boating (non-motorized)
*Fishing: The main fishing at Hume Lake consists of trout
*Hiking
*Swimming and related beach activities

== In pop culture ==

* The 1922 film &quot;The Sawmill&quot; was filmed at Hume Lake.

<doc id="795463" wikidata="Q2122948" url="?curid=795463" title="Monks Kirby">
<text>Monks Kirby is a village and civil parish in north-eastern Warwickshire, England. The population of the parish is 445. Monks Kirby is located around one mile east of the Fosse Way, around 8 miles north-west of Rugby, seven miles north-east of Coventry and six miles west of Lutterworth. Administratively it forms part of the borough of Rugby. One of the largest and most important villages in this part of Warwickshire in the Anglo-Saxon and later medieval period, the village continued to be a local administrative centre into the early 20th century.

The parish boundaries include two important landed estates: Newnham Paddox, seat of the family of the Earls of Denbigh since the 15th century and Newbold Revel, home of the medieval writer Sir Thomas Malory. Monks Kirby is today a small, attractive, wealthy commuter village with many residents working in Coventry, Birmingham, Leicester and London. Monks Kirby is dominated by the church of St Edith, a site of Christian worship since at least the 10th century and which functioned as a Priory in the Middle Ages. Reflecting its medieval aristocratic and ecclesiastical importance, Monks Kirby is the largest historic parish in Warwickshire and St Edith&#x27;s one of the largest parish churches in the county.

==History==
Monks Kirby has been inhabited since at least Roman times, with evidence (Roman urns and bricks) found around the Church suggesting either a Roman cemetery or villa on the current Church site.

===Anglo-Saxon Period and Norman Conquest===
The size of the parish, good soils and strategic location (the village boundaries reached to High Cross - the meeting point of the Fosse Way and Watling Street) all point to the importance of the village before the Norman Conquest. Shortly after the Conquest, in 1086 Domesday Book records Monks Kirby as the largest settlement in this part of the country (North Warwickshire and South Leicestershire) - significantly larger than the settlements that would become today&#x27;s towns and cities - Lutterworth, Rugby, Coventry and Birmingham.

The pre-Conquest church of Monks Kirby was the mother church (minster) for the surrounding area, connected to the important aristocratic estate of Newnham probably at least as far back as the eighth or ninth century. In the 900s the village was on the frontier between the Viking controlled Danelaw and Anglo-Saxon Mercia. Monks Kirby is just on the west (Anglo-Saxon) side of Watling Street, which was the border. The village&#x27;s name reflects the long-term influence of Danish settlement at the frontier: it is first recorded, in Latin, as &quot;Kirkberia&quot; in 1077 (see below); this is a mix of Danish English &quot;Kirk&quot; (church) and Anglo-Saxon &quot;bury&quot; meaning a fortified settlement. In time, the name became Kirkeby and then Kirby. 

At the time of the Norman Conquest, the neighbouring estate of Newnham Paddox was owned by Leofwin, nephew of Leofric, Earl of Mercia (husband of Lady Godiva). After the Conquest, the land around Monks Kirby came into the ownership of Geoffrey de la Guerche, a Breton knight who married Aelgifu, Leofwin&#x27;s daughter. Geoffrey rebuilt the Anglo Saxon church which had &quot;burst asunder&quot;, possibly in fighting between Saxons and Normans in the immediate post-Conquest period. Geoffrey endowed the rebuilt church with lands (notably the village of Copston Magna), and gave it as a priory to the Benedictine Abbey of St Nicolas in Anjou in France.

The Priory was named in honour of the Virgin Mary and St Denis. Unusually, the text of the founding Charter for the Priory survives: The dedication took place on 1 July 1077 and the Charter tells us the names of the first monks – Geoffrey, Ranulf, Stephen, Maurice, Roger and Herman. After Geoffrey&#x27;s death, his estates, including the lands around Monks Kirby reverted to the King, who subsequently granted them to Nigel d&#x27;Aubigny, the father of Roger de Mowbray whose descendants were to become Earls of Nottingham and Dukes of Norfolk. The Newnham family (who took their name from the estate) are recorded as holding the Newnham Paddox Estate under the Mowbrays from the 1100s.

===1100-1500===
The twelfth and thirteenth centuries were Monks Kirby&#x27;s highpoint. The monks produced at least one beautiful illuminated book and many miracles were apparently wrought at the Priory (see Monks Kirby Priory). In 1266 Henry III granted the monks a fair at Midsummer and a weekly market, a result of Monks Kirby&#x27;s growing importance. The name of one of the village streets, Bond End, reflects the boundary between the feudal tenant farmers (&quot;bondsmen&quot;) and the properties of the traders and craftsmen who operated around the Priory Church.

Through the fourteenth and early fifteenth century the Hundred Years War with France caused major problems for French-led priories like Monks Kirby. Money was short - the priory&#x27;s estates were intermittently confiscated by the King - and discipline was poor: in 1330 Monks Kirby&#x27;s Benedictines had needed to be reminded of basic rules such as the non-admission of women to the monastery, and their duty to the poor.

Having nearly fallen into ruin, the church was substantially rebuilt in around 1380. The basic structure and shape of the church today dates from this reconstruction, as well as one of the church&#x27;s current eight bells. In 1415 Henry V agreed that the Duke of Norfolk could transfer the priory and its lands out of nominally French hands, to become a house of the Carthusian Abbey established on the Duke&#x27;s estates at the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire. The Carthusians practised a strict monastic lifestyle and the revenues of Monks Kirby Priory provided most of their income but only two priests, and no monks, were maintained at Monks Kirby. The church was again altered in the late fifteenth century, and an octagonal spire was added which must have been an imposing local landmark.

===1500-1700===
 The Newnham Paddox Estate was held by a number of different families in the fourteenth and early fifteenth century until, on 11 November 1433, John Fildyng, or Feilding bought the estate; he was a descendent of the earlier owners, the Newnham family. The Feildings expanded their estate by buying parts of the Monks Kirby manor (i.e. the lands that belonged to Monks Kirby priory) from the monks at Axholme in the late 1400s and early 1500s. In the Reformation, King Henry VIII confiscated the assets of Axholme Priory. He granted the rectory and the patronage of Monks Kirby vicarage and the income from the collection of local tithes to his foundation of Trinity College, Cambridge. The large and valuable manor of Monks Kirby was rapidly claimed by the powerful Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. 

In the 1600s the Feildings&#x27; status rose when William Feilding&#x27;s handsome brother-in-law, George Villiers, became King James I&#x27;s favourite: Villiers ended up as the immensely powerful Duke of Buckingham. Villiers&#x27; friends and family rose with him and William Feilding was made the first Earl of Denbigh. Even William&#x27;s eight year old second son George (named after his important uncle) was given the right to his own earldom. Meanwhile, the Manor of Monks Kirby had passed to descendants of Charles Brandon until it was bought by George Villiers&#x27; mother Mary, Countess of Buckingham who bequeathed it to her grandson Basil Feilding, the second Earl of Denbigh on her death in 1632. The Feilding family thus came to own much of Monks Kirby, both the historic Newnham Paddox estate and the lands that in the medieval period had belonged to the Priory Church of Monks Kirby.

===1700 to 21st century===
The Church&#x27;s spire blew down in a storm on Christmas Night 1701. The enclosure of farming land in the eighteenth and nineteenth century saw the wealthy land owners of Monks Kirby deprive local people of their traditional access to common land. The Skipwith family, lords of Newbold Revel in the 1700s, extensively used their position as Members of Parliament to promote enclosure acts on behalf of their own family and friends, including the land at Stretton-under-Fosse.

The most notorious incident in the Monks Kirby enclosure process happened in 1837 when the 7th Earl of Denbigh wanted to rent a large parcel of land, Pailton Pastures, from the other major landowner, Trinity College, Cambridge. This involved clearing the land of its sitting tenants. There were riots by Pailton residents. One particular very elderly tenant, Thomas Gubbins, stood in the way of the Earl and the College&#x27;s plan. The Earl pursued the case until Gubbins - said to have been over 100 years old - was sent to prison where he soon died. This was scandalous even at the time: the county newspaper wrote, &quot;We may well wonder what could have been the feelings of a plaintiff [ie the Earl of Denbigh] in a case such as this. Is he now satisfied?&quot; Gubbins became known as the Pailton Martyr.

The Rector of Monks Kirby - appointed by Trinity College, Cambridge - played an eager part in the prosecution of Gubbins. The 7th Earl Denbigh and his wife Lady Mary are both buried in St Edith&#x27;s Church.

With the Church of England so clearly on the side of the powerful, it is unsurprising that many ordinary Monks Kirby residents turned to nonconformist churches from the 17th to the early 20th century. Nonconformity in the Parish dated back to the time of Oliver Cromwell and a Baptist congregation was established in 1817, its members initially suffering much persecution. The Baptist chapel]] was built at the end of Bell Lane, on the edge of the village, just outside the Earl of Denbigh&#x27;s lands. It had 150 seats and was demolished around 1960.

The 18th and 19th century enclosure process led to the establishment of larger, tenanted farms on the Denbigh, Newbold Revel and Trinity College, Cambridge lands: the distinctive Victorian farm buildings are a major feature of the rural landscape around Monks Kirby. The tenant farmers formed the dominant rural middle class in Monks Kirby society from the Victorian era to the mid twentieth century. The Monks Kirby Farmers Club Show was the major event of their year with hundreds of cows and horses exhibited and, at its peak in 1914, 7,000 people attending. Trinity College retains the benefice today (and therefore is still involved in appointing the vicar) but divested itself of substantial landholdings around Monks Kirby following the Second World War. Similarly, The Feilding family have - since the mid-twentieth century - steadily sold off much of their estate (for example selling 2,500 acres of the historic Newnham Paddox estate in 2014–15).

==Parish boundaries==
The historic parish boundaries of Monks Kirby, existing from the medieval era through to the nineteenth century included several neighbouring villages and hamlets: Copston Magna, Pailton, Stretton-under-Fosse, Newbold Revel, Brockhurst, Little Walton, Street Ashton and Easenhall. The Parish had an exclave in Leicestershire, the land known as Goresland in Ullesthorpe, separated from Monks Kirby by the neighbouring parish of Wibtoft and just over the county border. Monks Kirby was the largest parish in Warwickshire; the historic size of Monks Kirby was around 10,000 acres, 15 square miles. Around 1866, Pailton, Easenhall, Stretton-under-Fosse and Copston became separate parishes. Even within its much reduced modern boundaries, Monks Kirby civil parish still has an area of 4550 acres, around 7 square miles, placing it in top 11% of English parishes by area. The ecclesiastical parish no longer includes Copston or Easenhall but still includes Pailton and Stretton-under-Fosse. The (civil and ecclesiastical) boundaries of Monks Kirby still include the lands of the village of Cestersover, abandoned in the Middle Ages.

==Local government==
Early in the 17th century the hundred of Knightlow (one of the county&#x27;s four administrative divisions) was reorganised on a basis of four High Constables&#x27; divisions – Kenilworth, Monks Kirby, Rugby, and Southam. Monks Kirby retained its high constable until 1828. From 1834 the civil parish of Monks Kirby was part of Lutterworth Poor Law Union meaning people living in poverty in Monks Kirby were sent to the workhouse in Lutterworth. The Lutterworth Rural Sanitary District was introduced in 1875 covering the same area as the Poor Law Union. Rural Sanitary Districts (RSDs) were replaced with rural districts and aligned with county borders in 1894: Monks Kirby Rural District existed from 1894 to 1932 covering the Warwickshire parishes that had been in the Lutterworth RSD. In 1932 Monks Kirby Rural District was merged into Rugby Rural District, which in turn merged with Rugby Municipal Borough in 1974, to form today&#x27;s Rugby Borough Council.

==Monks Kirby Today==
Monks Kirby&#x27;s population today is only slightly higher than that recorded in the Domesday book, far lower than the village&#x27;s population in the nineteenth century and probably the twelfth and thirteenth century too. Since the 1950s the primarily agricultural population of the village has been replaced by a wealthy, well educated older demographic through a process of extended suburbanisation from the many nearby towns and cities. Residents are attracted by the quiet, well kept village, with good road connections. The village is in the Coventry Green Belt. Apart from one village pub, The Denbigh Arms, the village now has no shops or other commercial enterprises. There are two churches: St Edith&#x27;s Anglican Church and St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church. There is also a well-used village hall and the Revel school. The village has moved significantly since the medieval era and particularly in the last seventy years. While the historic village was centred around the parish church, the centre of the village today is further to the north east: the village has merged with Brockhurst which was a separate hamlet on the other side of the Smite brook.

==Roman Catholic Community==
Monks Kirby has been a local centre for the Roman Catholic faith since the conversion of Rudolph, the 8th Earl of Denbigh to Catholicism in 1850. St Joseph&#x27;s convent and girls school/orphanage were established in the village in the 1870s. The first nuns were Sisters of Charity from a convent on the Earl&#x27;s other estate at Pantasaph in Flintshire, North Wales. The Sisters of Charity were succeeded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1923. During the Second World War, The 10th Earl of Denbigh handed over Newnham Paddox House to another community of nuns: Cannonesses of the Holy Sepulchre. These nuns had evacuated their convent, New Hall in Chelmsford in 1940, due to the threat of bombing. During the war, the Canonesses ran a school for local children. They returned to New Hall in 1945.

The Sisters of Mercy remained at the Monks Kirby convent until 1977. In 1982 the convent was occupied by the first congregation of Mary, Mother of the Church (now called &quot;Mater Ecclesiae&quot;) established by Sister Catherine Mulligan as a new convent for mature women looking to enter religious life. In 1998 the Mater Ecclesiae congregation moved to Street Ashton House in the neighbouring hamlet of Street Ashton, where it was based until 2020. The remaining, elderly sisters have now dispersed and Street Ashton House sold, bringing to an end a 150-year tradition of (renewed) monastic life in Monks Kirby.

The nineteenth century convent buildings in the village of Monks Kirby have now been converted to housing but a new church, St Joseph&#x27;s Church, was built in the 1990s to a design by the architect John Holmes. This church was consecrated by the Archbishop of Birmingham, Bernard Longley, on 11 July 2012, the feast of St Benedict. St Joseph&#x27;s continues to be a worshipping community today, with a large congregation gathering on Sundays from the parish which spreads beyond the small village of Monks Kirby. There is also a daily Mass in the parish. Planning permission has been granted for a small church hall, to be built on land to the rear of the Church. Highlights during the year include the Annual May Procession when the parish process in honour of Our Lady ending with the crowning of the statue and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. There is also a Corpus Christi procession in June from the Village Green to St Joseph&#x27;s. In July 2018 St Joseph&#x27;s fitted a new bell system which allows the Angelus to be rung at 12 noon and 6pm as well as calling the faithful to Mass. At special times of the year and at the end of the school day Hymns are played on the automated carillon.

The present parish priest is a priest of the Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham and the Parish is formally in the care of the Ordinariate. The Ordinariate Use of the Mass (Divine Worship) is celebrated weekly and St Joseph&#x27;s has become a focus for members of the Ordinariate from the Leicestershire and East Warwickshire area. Evensong and Benediction are celebrated. On the outskirts of Monks Kirby is a Roman Catholic burial site, originally a private graveyard for the Feilding family but which today is used for burials from St Joseph&#x27;s. The Chapel of the Sacred Heart at the burial ground was designed by the architect Thomas Henry Wyatt as part of the remodelling of Newnham Paddox House, undertaken for the eighth earl in 1888.

==The Revel School==
Children from Monks Kirby and surrounding villages attend the Revel School, which is possibly unique in that it is a Church of England school with Roman Catholic provision and Catechesis. Children from the school regularly visit the Catholic Church for worship and are prepared through the school for their First Holy Communion. Both the Church of England Rector and Catholic Parish Priest lead worship in the school. School Masses (within St Joseph&#x27;s) take place regularly.

==Newnham Paddox==

The Newnham Paddox estate neighbours Monks Kirby and is the seat of the Earl of Denbigh. Much of the estate has been sold in recent decades. The estate was very ancient, probably dating from the post-Roman, Anglo-Saxon invasion period when new settlements were established (hence &quot;New-ham&quot;). A very large manor house existed on the estate until 1952, which had at least three stages of development:
* There was a large, probably timber-framed house (with 34 hearths) built in the late 16th or early 17th century. In the late 1600s, grand formal gardens were laid out with an immense series of pools (known as the &quot;Great Canal&quot;) running behind and alongside the house. These can be seen in an engraving produced in 1707.
* In 1754-68 Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown built a large mansion house for the fifth and sixth Earls (perhaps incorporating elements of the earlier house). At the same time, Brown removed the formal gardens replacing them with landscaped garden in his distinctive style.
* In the late 19th century, the house was substantially redeveloped in the French style including an ornate Roman Catholic chapel, by the architect Thomas Henry Wyatt. This nineteenth century house was demolished in 1952 after receiving water damage resulting from the thawing of frozen pipes at a time when the family was hit by heavy death duties.

There is very little information on the Capability Brown house. However, in 2020, archaeologists discovered that, &quot;The former manor designed by Capability Brown at Newnham Paddox was still extant just below the turf level.&quot; A full excavation of the site was scheduled to begin in the same year. The grand gates, stables and Brown&#x27;s landscaped gardens remain and the current Earl still lives in a twentieth century, wooden house in the grounds. The grounds of the house are opened at least annually (though not in 2020 or 2021 due to Covid ) for a popular springtime &quot;Daffodil Sunday&quot; event when thousands of daffodils come in to flower across the grounds.

<doc id="795488" wikidata="Q952468" url="?curid=795488" title="Sentenced">
<text>Sentenced was a Finnish gothic metal band that played melodic death metal in their early years. The band formed in 1989 in the town of Muhos and broke up in 2005.

Lead guitarist Miika Tenkula was the band&#x27;s vocalist for the first album, but duties were shifted to bassist Taneli Jarva for the next two albums, &quot;North from Here&quot; and &quot;Amok&quot;, until his departure in 1995. Under new lead vocalist Ville Laihiala, Sentenced shifted from melodic death metal to gothic metal and enjoyed a run of commercial success in Finland, including three consecutive number-one albums. The band announced in 2005 that their eighth album &quot;The Funeral Album&quot; would be their last. The single &quot;Ever-Frost&quot; spent six weeks at number one in Finland and Sentenced&#x27;s final show took place on 1 October in their hometown Oulu.

Tenkula died of a heart attack in 2009.

==History==

===Early years (1988–1991)===

Sentenced started in 1988 as Deformity and changed their name to Sentenced in 1989, after a few line-up changes. The original line-up consisted of Miika Tenkula (lead guitar and vocals), Sami Lopakka (guitar), Vesa Ranta (drums), and Lari Kylmänen (bass). They recorded two demo tapes: &quot;When Death Joins Us...&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Rotting Ways to Misery&quot; in 1991. The band actually got their very first record deal (with the French label Thrash Records) after their first demo.

===&quot;Shadows of the Past&quot; (1991–1993)===

In 1991, bassist Taneli Jarva joined the band, replacing Kylmänen just as the band was about to record their debut album, &quot;Shadows of the Past&quot;. At that time, their musical style was fast, typical European death metal. In Spring 1992, they recorded a three-song promotional tape, &quot;Journey to Pohjola&quot;, and as a result got a deal with the Finnish Spinefarm Records. By the year of 1992 had done over 50 live shows and sold all 1500 copies of their debut album &quot;Shadows of the Past&quot;, their earlier 2 demos and a lot of merchandise.

===&quot;North from Here&quot; (1993–1994)===

The second album, &quot;North from Here&quot;, was released in the spring of 1993, and later that year &quot;The Trooper EP&quot;. Jarva had assumed lead vocal duties using a different style than Tenkula&#x27;s. It was &quot;North From Here&quot; that earned the band the attention of German record label Century Media Records, and in 1994 Sentenced left Spinefarm in order to head toward a wider market with a new multi-album contract under Century Media.

===&quot;Amok&quot; (1994–1996)===
In 1995, Sentenced released their &#x27;break through&#x27; album, &quot;Amok&quot;, which is considered by many to be their best work. Compared to earlier releases, the music had slowed down somewhat, acquiring a more melodic structure. The track &quot;Nepenthe&quot; was complemented with a music video and the band took to tour Europe in two full-length tours supporting Samael and Tiamat.

In autumn, the band released the &quot;Love &amp; Death&quot; CD. Music-wise, it kept a fairly similar concept as &quot;Amok&quot;, as the songs had been written around the same time. Sentenced had achieved success in doom/death markets, but Jarva left the band because of musical differences.

===&quot;Down&quot; (1996–1998)===

After Jarva&#x27;s departure, Ville Laihiala (of Breed fame) joined the band in 1996, just weeks before the band was due to head to Germany to record their fourth album &quot;Down&quot; with producer Waldemar Sorychta. Once again, the music became more melodic with a significant NWOBHM influence. During this time, bassist Sami Kukkohovi also joined the band, but only as a session member on gigs. Later, in spring 1997 he was granted a permanent slot in the line-up. The &quot;Down&quot; album gained great reviews in music-magazines all over the world, and was named Album of the month in German magazines such as Rock Hard and Metal Hammer. 1996 and the following year, saw Sentenced on a worldwide success crusade.

===&quot;Frozen&quot; (1998–2000)===

Sentenced&#x27;s fifth full-length album, &quot;Frozen&quot;, was also recorded at the Woodhouse Studios, and released in 1998, its style is similar to &quot;Down&quot;. Laihiala and Kukkohovi had become initiated into the band, so they participated in the composition process, resulting in the next album: &quot;Frozen&quot;. In 1999, a special edition of &quot;Frozen&quot; was released, containing a re-colored (gold) cover and rearranged track running order, with four cover songs included.

===&quot;Crimson&quot; (2000–2002)===

The next Sentenced album to be released was &quot;Crimson&quot; in 2000. The single &quot;Killing Me, Killing You&quot; demonstrated the band&#x27;s turn away from melodic death metal. The album was followed by an extensive tour. That was the first time the band visited USA. The album peaked in 1st place on the Finnish album chart.

===&quot;The Cold White Light&quot; (2002–2004)===

Two years after the release of &quot;The Cold White Light&quot;, the band was seen in a slightly different light, the lyrics displaying some self-irony and even a rare positive edge. They released the single &quot;No One There&quot; which peaked The Finnish Charts at Number 1 following that with an extensive US tour alongside Killswitch Engage, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames. The album peaked 45th place in the German album chart. The single &quot;No One There&quot; was on the 1st place as well in the Finnish single chart. The band went on a European Tour with Lacuna Coil.

After &quot;The Cold White Light&quot;, they released a CD single in 2003 along with songs by other bands on a four track compilation single that was dedicated to Oulun Kärpät, the ice hockey team of the band&#x27;s hometown, Routasydän (translates to &quot;Heart of Permafrost&quot;) remains the only song Sentenced sang in Finnish, and cannot be found elsewhere. The song caused something of a stir in Finland, as several politicians reviewed the lyrics and purported them to contain Nazi overtones, which the band has steadfastly refuted.

===&quot;The Funeral Album&quot; and final gigs (2005)===

In early 2005 the band announced that their following release, &quot;The Funeral Album&quot;, would be their last. They performed farewell gigs during the spring and summer and ended with a final show on 1 October 2005 in their hometown Oulu. The concert film &quot;Buried Alive&quot;, directed by Mika Ronkainen, filmed at the funeral gig, was premiered at Oulu Music Video Festival on 9 September 2006. In 2005 &quot;The Funeral Album&quot; was awarded gold status in Finland for sales in excess of 15,000 copies, footage of the event is filmed in the &quot;Buried Alive&quot; DVD! The CD topped the Finnish album chart upon its release in May 2005 and made it to position No. 49 on the German Media Control chart. &quot;Ever-Frost&quot; single went straight to 1st position on Official Finnish Single Chart staying there for 6 straight weeks.

===Aftermath (2006–present)===

Sentenced have been awarded Platinum in the band&#x27;s native Finland for their posthumous live DVD &quot;Buried Alive&quot;. The trophy was handed out to the band&#x27;s former members at the Century Media 20th anniversary party at the Tavastia club in Helsinki on 14 August 2008, where Poisonblack and labelmates Norther and Kivimetsän Druidi played exclusive gigs to properly celebrate this special event.

All hope for the band to return was gone when guitarist and founding member Miika Tenkula died on 19 February 2009. On 26 June 2009 it was announced by his family that Miika died from a heart attack caused by a genetic heart condition that he had for many years previous to the break-up. He is buried in the Kirkkosaari cemetery in his hometown Muhos.

On 13 November 2009, Sentenced released a box set of 16 CDs and 2 DVDs chronicling their entire career in a coffin-shaped box. The box-set also included rare and previously unreleased tracks.

In 2011 a tribute CD was released by a couple of Russian bands. The CD is called &quot;Russian Tribute To Sentenced&quot;.

On 12 December 2014, a book written by Matti Riekki, a Finnish rock journalist, about the band&#x27;s history was released. It is named &quot;Täältä Pohjoiseen - Sentencedin Tarina&quot;. After years of being available in Finnish only, an English translation was released in 2021. The title translates to &quot;North from Here – The Story of Sentenced.&quot;

Vesa Ranta released a photo book &quot;Agony Walk – On the Road with Sentenced&quot; in September 2019. Sami Lopakka released his first novel &quot;Marras&quot; in January 2014. The novel is about a fictional Oulu-based metal band&#x27;s European tour and has elements inspired by his experiences when previously touring with Sentenced.

<text>Luigi Federico Menabrea (4 September 1809 – 24 May 1896), later made 1st Count Menabrea and 1st Marquess of Valdora, was an Italian statesman, general, diplomat, and mathematician who served as the seventh prime minister of Italy from 1867 to 1869.

==Biography==
Menabrea was born at Chambéry, then part of the First French Empire. He was educated at the University of Turin, where he qualified as an engineer and became a doctor of mathematics. As an officer of engineers he replaced Cavour in 1831 at the fortress of Bard. He then became professor of mechanics and construction at the military academy and at the university of Turin. Among his notable publications: &quot;Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage, Esq.&quot; with notes by translator Ada Lovelace (1842), which described many aspects of computer architecture and is considered the first modern example of programming. Both are available on Wikisource:

King Charles Albert sent him in 1848 on diplomatic missions to secure the adhesion of Modena and Parma to Sardinia. He entered the Piedmontese parliament, and was attached successively to the Ministries of War and Foreign Affairs.

Menabrea belonged to the right centre, and until the events of 1859 he believed in the possibility of a compromise between the Vatican and the state. He was major-general and commander-in-chief of the engineers in the Lombard campaign of 1859. He superintended the siege works against Peschiera, was present at Palestro and Solferino, and repaired the fortifications of some of the northern fortresses. In 1860 he became lieutenant-general and conducted the siege of Gaeta. He was appointed senator and received the title of count.

Entering the Ricasoli cabinet of 1861 as minister for the navy, he held the portfolio of public works until 1864 in the succeeding Farini and Minghetti cabinets. After the war of 1866, he was chosen as Italian plenipotentiary for the negotiation of the Treaty of Prague and for the transfer of Venetia to Italy. In October 1867, he succeeded Rattazzi in the premiership, and was called upon to deal with the difficult situation created by Garibaldi&#x27;s invasion of the Papal States and by the catastrophe of Mentana.

Menabrea disavowed Garibaldi and instituted judicial proceedings against him; but in negotiations with the French government he protested against the retention of the temporal power by the pope and insisted on the Italian right of interference in Rome. He was in on the secret of the direct negotiations between Victor Emmanuel and Napoleon III in June 1869, and refused to entertain the idea of a French alliance unless Italy were allowed to occupy the Papal States, and, on occasion, Rome itself. On the eve of the assembly of the Oecumenical Council at Rome Menabrea reserved to the Italian government its right in respect of any measures directed against Italian institutions.

He withdrew from seminary students in 1860 the exemption from military service which they had hitherto enjoyed. Throughout his term of office he was supported by the finance minister Count Cambray Digny, who forced through parliament the grist tax proposed by Quintino Sella, though in an altered form from the earlier proposal. After a series of changes in the cabinet, and many crises, Menabrea resigned in December 1869 on the election of a new chamber in which he did not command a majority. He was made marquis of Valdora in 1875. His successor in the premiership, Giovanni Lanza, in order to remove him from his influential position as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to the king, sent him to London as ambassador, where he remained until in 1882 he replaced General Cialdini at the Paris Embassy. Ten years later he withdrew from public life, and died at Saint Capin on 24 May 1896.

<doc id="795518" wikidata="Q4287215" url="?curid=795518" title="Vietnam Campaign Medal">
<text>The Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, also known as the Vietnam Campaign Medal (), is a South Vietnamese military campaign medal which was created in 1949 and awarded during the First Indochina War. During the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War), the South Vietnamese government awarded the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal with Device (&quot;1960– &quot;) to members of the South Vietnamese military for wartime service and on March 24, 1966, to members of the U.S. military for support of operations in Vietnam. In May 1966, other allied foreign military personnel became eligible for the award.

The medal was awarded for two different periods of service in Vietnam. The first period for the award was from 8 March 1949 to 20 July 1954. The second period was from 1 January 1960 to the end of the Vietnam War (the date was to be given when the war ended and North Vietnam was defeated). On 30 April 1975, Saigon was captured by the North Vietnamese army and South Vietnam surrendered and disbanded. The medal was not awarded after 28 March 1973, when the last U.S. troops left South Vietnam in accordance with the Paris Peace Accords.

==Award criteria==
===First Indochina War===
The Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal was created by the said Republic in 1949 and manufactured in France. The French soldiers engaged alongside the South Vietnamese were a priori eligible but were not authorized to wear this medal which duplicated the French commemorative medal and the Colonial Medal with &quot;Extrême-Orient&quot; clasp.

The &quot;1949-1954&quot; bar to be placed on the ribbon, will be created later by Memorandum 2655 of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam of October 8, 1965 to distinguish the first conflict known as the &quot;Indochina War&quot; from the second started in 1960 and referred to as the &quot;Vietnam War&quot;.

===Second Indochina War (Vietnam War)===
During the Vietnam War, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal with Device (1960–) was manufactured in the United States and governed by Republic of Vietnam Decrees No. 149/SL/CT of 12 May 1964 and No 205/CT/LDQG/SL of 2 December 1965. The medal was established by the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Order No. 48, 24 March 1966. The medal is awarded to military personnel, both South Vietnamese for twelve months wartime service in the field, and allied foreign military who have directly participated for six months in &quot;a large-scale military campaign during certain periods of time&quot;. All RVN and foreign personnel who served less than six months must meet the following requirements: were wounded by a hostile force; were captured by hostile forces, but later escaped, was rescued, or released; or were killed in action or otherwise in the line of duty. Awarded in a single class, the medal was awarded under the authority of the Chief of the Joint General Staff, Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces.

====United States====
Public Law 88–257 permitted U.S. military personnel to accept the medal for service performed in Vietnam from 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973, inclusive. From March 1966 to March 1973, the medal was also awarded to any service member who, while serving outside the geographical limits of the Republic of Vietnam, contributed direct combat support to the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces for six months. This stipulation most often applied to members who performed Vietnam War support from the 7th Fleet (all members of the fleet serving off the coast of Vietnam), Thailand and Guam (air crews if aircraft out of Thailand and Guam; no ground support staff), and Japan. In such cases, a U.S. service member needed meet the criteria established for the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (Vietnam) or Vietnam Service Medal during the period of service required to qualify for the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. 

Personnel assigned in the Republic of Vietnam on 28 January 1973 needed to meet one of the following: serve a minimum of 60 days in the Republic of Vietnam as of that date; complete a minimum of 60 days service in the Republic of Vietnam during the period from 28 January 1973 to 28 March 1973, inclusive.

====Australia====
The Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal was awarded to Australian military personnel for service in South Vietnam during the period 31 July 1962 to 28 March 1973. The requirements for the award were: at least 181 days service, either continuous or aggregated, unless killed on active service (KIA); or wounded in action (includes psychological injury) and evacuated (medically evacuated other than being wounded does not meet requirement for medal); or captured and later released or escaped.

====New Zealand====
The Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal was referred to as the &quot;New Zealand Vietnamese Campaign Medal&quot; (named the South Vietnamese Campaign Medal by the New Zealand Forces in South Vietnam). The medal was awarded to New Zealand Forces for service in Vietnam for six months between 1964 (arrived Vietnam June 1964) and 1973 (left Vietnam 22 December 1972). The medal was approved for wear in 1966.

==Appearance of medal==
The Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal is made of a gold colored metal in the shape of a 36 mm wide six-pointed white enameled star with six pointed gold rays between the arms of the star. In the center of the star is an 18 mm green colored disc bearing a gold colored map of Vietnam with three painted flames in red between North and South Vietnam, signifying the three regions of Vietnam. On the reverse of the medal is a circle bearing the inscription &quot;Chiến Dịch&quot; (Campaign) above and &quot;Bội Tinh&quot; (Medal) below the word &quot;VIET-NAM&quot; in the center. The suspension ribbon and service ribbon of the medal is green (to represent freedom) with three vertical white (to represent purity) stripes.

;Ribbon devices
The Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Memorandum 2655 (8 October 1965) authorized two sets of two silver-plated devices ( 1 &quot; wide and &quot; wide) for the suspension ribbon of the medal, and service ribbon of the medal and the miniature medal suspension ribbon, to indicate two separate periods of struggle against communism in South Vietnam. Both sets of the devices if authorized, could be worn on the ribbons.

*Period 1: 8 March 1949 – 20 July 1954: The &quot;1949–54&quot; device is worn on the medal suspension ribbon and the &quot;49–54&quot; device is worn on the service ribbon of the medal and the miniature medal suspension ribbon. These devices are not authorized for wear by American military personnel.
* Period 2: 1 January 1960 – the end of the war: The &quot;1960– &quot; device is worn on the medal suspension ribbon and the &quot;60– &quot; device is worn on the service ribbon of the medal and the miniature medal suspension ribbon.

The unusual appearance was caused by the Republic of Vietnam government stating that the &quot;1960– &quot; and &quot;60–&quot; devices would show the dates of the Vietnam War from start to finish, with the ending year placed on the devices when the South Vietnamese had prevailed over the invading North Vietnam (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) forces. However, on 30 April 1975, the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon was captured, and South Vietnam surrendered that day to the North Vietnamese army under the orders of General Duong Van Minh, who since 28 April was the president of South Vietnam.

==Order of wear==
The Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal is considered a foreign award by the United States, South Korean, Australian, and New Zealand governments. The equivalent award from the U.S. Armed Forces is known as the Vietnam Service Medal. The joint Australian and New Zealand campaign medal awarded for service in the Vietnam War is the Vietnam Medal, with the Australian support service being recognized by the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal.

<text>An oak leaf cluster is a ribbon device to denote preceding decorations and awards consisting of a miniature bronze or silver twig of four oak leaves with three acorns on the stem. It is authorized by the United States Armed Forces for a specific set of decorations and awards of the Department of Defense, Department of the Army, and Department of the Air Force.

The bronze oak leaf cluster represents one additional award, while the silver oak leaf cluster is worn in lieu of five bronze oak leaf clusters.

==Criteria and wear==
Oak leaf clusters are worn with the stems of the leaves pointing to the wearer&#x27;s right. For medals, oak leaf clusters are worn on the medal&#x27;s suspension ribbon. For service ribbons, oak leaf clusters are worn, with no more than four oak leaf clusters being worn side by side. If the number of authorized oak leaf clusters exceeds four, a second ribbon is authorized for wear and is worn after the first ribbon. The second ribbon counts as one additional award, after which more leaf clusters may be added to the second ribbon. If future awards reduce the number of oak leaf clusters worn on the first ribbon due to bronze oak leaf clusters being replaced by a silver oak leaf cluster, the second ribbon is removed and the appropriate number of devices is placed on the first ribbon.

===Examples===
The following are examples of the first through twenty-first awards of an Army Commendation Medal with the bronze and silver oak leaf clusters:
==Decorations and awards==
Oak leaf clusters may be worn on Department of Defense, Department of the Army, and Department of the Air Force decorations and awards presented to members of the eight uniformed services: the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and the NOAA Commissioned Corps.
Except for the Air Medal, unique decorations and awards issued by Department of the Army or Department of the Air Force, and those decorations and awards issued by the Department of Defense, the other uniformed services use inch stars to indicate subsequent personal decorations only; a gold inch star is equivalent to a bronze oak leaf cluster, while a silver inch star is equivalent to a silver oak leaf cluster. While the Air Force uses oak leaf clusters for the Air Medal, since the Vietnam War, the Army has used bronze Arabic numerals to denote subsequent awards, in which case the ribbon denotes the first award and numerals starting with the numeral &quot;2&quot; denote additional awards.

==Other nations==
In other nations, oak leaf clusters are also used as symbols for various awards and decorations. In Germany, the German oak is the national tree of Germany, thus oak leaves are a prominent symbol on most German military orders. During World War II, the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the German Iron Cross could be awarded with the additional distinction of oak leaves (&quot;mit Eichenlaub&quot;). Of the 7,313 awards of the Knight&#x27;s Cross, only 882 received oak leaves. After World War II, Iron Crosses awarded previously could be worn by the recipient provided the swastika was replaced by oak leaves. The Bundeswehr awards the Cross of Honour for Bravery for extraordinary bravery. The Cross of Honour for Bravery differs from the Badge of Honour by an adornment in the shape of stylized double oak leaves. Furthermore, it was featured on the Pfennig in Germany and since the introduction of the euro in 2001 it is used on the obverse side of the German euro coinage. In earlier times, the Pour le Mérite, the highest military order in the Kingdom of Prussia, could also be awarded with oak leaves. A civil version of the order, for accomplishments in the arts and sciences, still exists in the Federal Republic of Germany.

In Commonwealth countries, a bronze oak leaf signifies a Mention in Despatches, and is worn as a gallantry award in its own right, rather than to signify multiple instances of campaign service. The Commonwealth equivalent of a United States oak leaf cluster is a medal bar worn with a campaign medal.

Oak leaves are a common motif on military symbols in Turkey because of the famed longevity of the oak tree. They appear on the emblem of Turkish Land Forces, the emblem of Gendarmerie General Command and together with acorns on the non-commissioned officer insignia of Turkish Naval Forces.

<doc id="795575" wikidata="Q1352622" url="?curid=795575" title="Stanley Donwood">
<text>Dan Rickwood (born 29 October 1968), known professionally as Stanley Donwood, is an English artist and writer. Since 1994, he has created all the artwork for the rock band Radiohead with their singer, Thom Yorke, plus many of Yorke&#x27;s other projects, including Atoms for Peace and the Smile. In 2002, the pair won a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for the Radiohead album &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. Donwood also creates artwork for Glastonbury Festival, and has published books of short stories and a memoir.

==Career==
Rickwood uses the pen name Stanley Donwood. He said: &quot;I like to separate the person I am at home &quot;—&quot; washing up, vacuuming, picking up the kids from school and so on &quot;—&quot; from whoever Stanley Donwood is.&quot; He described record shops, with their shelves of album covers, as his introduction to art.

=== Radiohead ===
Donwood and the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, met as art students at the University of Exeter. Donwood said his first impressions of Yorke were that he was &quot;Mouthy. Pissed off. Someone I could work with.&quot; Yorke wrote: &quot;I met him first day at art college ... I figured I&#x27;d either end up really not liking this person at all, or working with him for the rest of my life.&quot;

Yorke asked Donwood to produce the cover art for Radiohead&#x27;s 1994 EP &quot;My Iron Lung.&quot; Donwood was not a fan of rock music, and said he took the work because he knew Yorke. He said in 2015: &quot;[Radiohead] wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea at all. Now they have seen sense and are a lot more electro. I like their stuff now.&quot; 

Donwood has worked with Yorke to create artwork for all of Radiohead&#x27;s releases and promotional material since. Donwood works as Radiohead record, allowing the music to influence the artwork. Whereas Donwood described himself as having a tendency towards &quot;detailing and perfectionism&quot;, he said Yorke is &quot;completely opposed, fucking everything up ... I do something, then he fucks it up, then I fuck up what he&#x27;s done ... and we keep doing that until we&#x27;re happy with the result. It&#x27;s a competition to see who &#x27;wins&#x27; the painting, which one of us takes possession of it in an artistic way.&quot; 

In 2002, Donwood and Yorke won a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for the special edition for the album &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. Donwood contributed to &quot;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&quot;, a 2021 interactive experience with music and artwork from &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001). He also creates artwork for Yorke&#x27;s solo records and Yorke&#x27;s bands Atoms for Peace and the Smile.

=== Exhibitions ===
In 2006, Donwood&#x27;s exhibition &quot;London Views&quot; consisted of a series of 14 lino prints of various London landmarks being destroyed by fire and flood. The prints were exhibited at the Lazarides Gallery in London. One of the prints was used as the cover art for Yorke&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Eraser&quot; (2006).

In November 2006, Donwood exhibited the original paintings and other artwork done by him and Yorke for Radiohead albums, at Iguapop Gallery in Barcelona. In May 2015, Donwood opened an exhibition of Radiohead artwork, &quot;The Panic Office&quot;, in Sydney, Australia, for which Yorke composed an original soundtrack. In 2021, Donwood designed a Radiohead-themed Brompton bicycle to be auctioned for the charity Crew Nation. 

In October 2021, Donwood and Yorke curated an exhibition of Radiohead artwork at Christie&#x27;s headquarters in London. Donwood auctioned paintings and other artwork he created for &quot;Kid A&quot;. In September 2023, Yorke and Donwood exhibited a selection of artwork, The Crow Flies, in London. The paintings, based on Islamic pirate maps and 1960s US military topographic charts, began as work for the Smile&#x27;s first album, &quot;A Light For Attracting Attention&quot; (2022).

=== Writing ===
Donwood has published three collections of short stories: &quot;Slowly Downward: A Collection of Miserable Stories&quot; (2001), &quot;Household Worms&quot; (2011) and &quot;Bad Island&quot; (2020). He contributed stories to &quot;The Universal Sigh&quot;, a free single-issue newspaper created to promote Radiohead&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;The King of Limbs.&quot; In 2019, he published a memoir about his work, &quot;There Will Be No Quiet&quot;.

=== Six Inch Records ===
In late 2006, Donwood and Richard Lawrence launched an independent record company, Six Inch Records. The label released three albums, with 333 copies of each. The CDs were packaged by hand into sleeves that were six inches square. All mechanised operations – printing, cutting and scoring – were carried out using a 1965 Heidelberg platen press. On 18 February 2009, Donwood announced that Six Inch Records had closed.

=== Other work ===
In 2006, Donwood began creating and selling large screen prints. In an interview with AllMusic, he explained it as an effort to reconnect with the process of print making and as a means to share his art in a larger format than the small, low-quality prints in album cover and insert art, &quot;It&#x27;s a way of getting pictures out in the way they should be seen; not as 4-colour litho on cheap paper, but as real pieces of artwork that have a much greater visual impact.&quot; Donwood creates artwork for Glastonbury Festival.

Donwood has created book covers for the nature writer Robert Macfarlane. In 2021, he collaborated with Macfarlane on an edition of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s poems published by the Folio Society. Donwood provided the illustrations for the poems selected and introduced by Macfarlane. Donwood&#x27;s illustrations were exhibited at the Jealous Gallery in London in 2021 and the Fine Foundation Gallery at Durlston Castle in Durlston Country Park in 2021.

<doc id="795578" wikidata="Q4218274" url="?curid=795578" title="William Kashtan">
<text>William Kashtan (27 June 1909 – 1993) was the general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada for 23 years beginning in January 1965, several months following the death of Leslie Morris, until his retirement in 1988. The delay in his assuming of the position was due to the opposition of Tim Buck to his appointment.

Kashtan was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1909. In 1927, at the age of 18, he joined the Young Communist League. Two years later, he moved to southern Ontario to organize for the YCL there and then became the League&#x27;s general secretary in 1930. In 1936, he helped found the Canadian Youth Congress which, at its peak, had over 400,000 members.

He visited Spain early in the Spanish Civil War and on his return helped organize the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion.

After World War II he served as Toronto organizer of the Labor-Progressive Party, as the Communist Party was known from 1943 to 1959, and served subsequently as industrial director, labour secretary and central organizer.

He was a perennial candidate for the Labor-Progressive Party and then the Communist Party of Canada and became general secretary of the party in 1965, despite the opposition of party chairman and longtime leader Tim Buck.

Kashtan never succeeded in winning election to the House of Commons of Canada, and retired in 1988. He was an orthodox, pro-Moscow Communist and consistently supported the Soviet Union through various shifts in policy at the Kremlin. Kashtan opposed Eurocommunism in the 1970s when many other Communist Parties in the west embraced it.

In 1970, Kashtan spoke out against the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) group in Quebec, describing it as a terrorist organization and claiming that its methods were not consistent with genuine revolutionary behaviour.

In 1971, on behalf of the CPC, he suggested James Gareth Endicott resign as president of the Canadian Peace Congress because he had drawn anti-Soviet and pro-China views, to which Endicott consented.

Kashtan retired as party leader in 1988 and was replaced by George Hewison. In the early 1990s, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Hewison and his supporters attempted to move the Communist Party away from Marxism-Leninism and towards social democracy in light of the failure of Soviet-style Communism. Kashtan came out of retirement to fight the changes, along with future Party leader and then member of the Central Executive, Elizabeth Rowley.

His views on the Soviet-Afghan war can be summarized in his 1980 speech at University of Alberta:The Soviet Union&#x27;s involvement Afghanistan was not an act of aggression or intervention ... Rather, the Soviet Union was honoring a 1978 treaty with Afghanistan, which stipulated that Afghanistan could ask the U.S.S.R. for military aid ... He cited resistance to the revolution by the land-owning and capitalist classes as an internal factor. And continuing interference in the affairs of Afghanistan by Cpina [&quot;recte&quot; China], Pakistan, as well as the CIA, is an external reason mentioned by Kashtan.

<text>Gerald Caiafa Jr. (born April 21, 1959), better known by his stage name Jerry Only, is an American musician, best known as the bassist for the Misfits and later the vocalist as well. He is the only member to appear in every Misfits lineup except the original.

==Biography==
===Misfits===

Gerald Caiafa Jr. was born in Lodi, New Jersey. He started The Misfits with Glenn Danzig on vocals and Manny Martínez on drums in 1977, just a few months after receiving his first bass as a late Christmas present. He would work at his father&#x27;s machine shop during the week to help finance the band and play shows on the weekend. This would go on for several years and the band split due to differences between Danzig and the rest of the band. During this downtime, Only and his brother Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein (guitarist in the 1980-1983 lineup of the Misfits) formed Kryst The Conqueror. In 1995, Only settled a legal battle out of court with co-founder Glenn Danzig, allowing him rights to the Misfits&#x27; name on a performing level, while they split the money on merchandising. He reformed the band with Doyle, vocalist Michale Graves, and drummer Dr. Chud.

Chud and Graves left the group in 2000 to form Graves. In reaction to the loss of members, Doyle left the Misfits. Graves, Doyle and Chud were replaced on the M25 tour by Dez Cadena, formerly of Black Flag and DC3, on guitar and Marky Ramone, formerly of The Ramones, on drums. Only took up the singing duties from this point till the present date. In early 2005, Marky left the group and Only brought in ex-Misfit and Black Flag drummer ROBO to rejoin the group. A new album was recorded in 2010 in Colorado entitled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rain&quot; which was released in October 2011. A single, &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;, was released at the mischief night show 2009 at Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey.

In 2013, Only and the Misfits released a new album entitled &quot;DEAD ALIVE!&quot; recorded live at several shows.

In 2017, the reunited lineup performed two additional concerts at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on December 28 and The Forum in Inglewood, California on December 30. They also performed at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey on May 19, 2018.

===World Championship Wrestling===
In 1999, Only and the rest of the then Misfits lineup had a brief stint in World Championship Wrestling when they aligned with wrestler Vampiro. Only participated in probably the most memorable match of the Misfits&#x27; time when he fought Dr. Death in a steel cage match. Only was dominated in the match but Death was distracted when the rest of the Misfits interfered and attacked his manager Oklahoma (a parody of Jim Ross), pouring barbecue sauce in his eyes. Only won the match after being accidentally Irish whipped through the cage door by Dr. Death.

===Only/Danzig lawsuit===
On May 6, 2014, it was announced that Glenn Danzig had filed a lawsuit against Jerry Only, claiming Only registered trademarks for everything Misfits-related in 2000 behind Danzig&#x27;s back, misappropriating exclusive ownership over the trademarks for himself, including the band&#x27;s iconic &quot;Crimson Ghost&quot; logo. Danzig claims that this violated a 1994 contract the two had. Danzig says that after registering the trademarks, Only secretly entered into deals with various merchandisers and cut him out of any potential profits in the process. He said that Only has purposefully led merchandisers, including Hot Topic, to believe that they are legally bound not to accept licenses to exploit the Marks from Danzig or his designees, and Only continues to do so. He said that through this, Only has caused merchandisers not to do business with him and it has deceived consumers as to the source of the merchandise which bore the trademarks. Danzig said a vast majority of the Misfits fans associate the trademarks with the 1977–1983 classic Misfits era when Danzig was a member of the band and not with the current era Misfits. Danzig feels that through false advertising and misrepresentations to merchandisers and consumers it has caused him to suffer damages in excess of $75,000. In August 2014, the judge dismissed the case in favor of Only.

===Sid Vicious===
On 1 February 1979, Only attended a party on Bank Street in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and was introduced to Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious who was in town to launch himself as a solo artist. Earlier in the day Vicious had been released on bail from Riker’s Island (where he had been undergoing forced detoxication after an assault on Todd Smith and breaking terms of his previous bail for the alleged murder of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen who was found stabbed to death at the Chelsea Hotel in October 1978). Only arrived early and was making bolognese sauce with Vicious&#x27; mother, Anne Beverly, but once Vicious&#x27; drug-taking friends arrived and started getting high, he left. Later that day he discovered that Vicious had died of an overdose which was widely reported as a suicide. Only maintains that Vicious overdosed accidentally from his tolerance being lower as the result of having been through rehabilitation whilst in prison.

<text>Alexander McLeish (born 21 January 1959) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player. He played as a defender for Aberdeen during their 1980s glory years, making nearly 500 League appearances for the club, and won 77 caps for Scotland.

McLeish started his managerial career with spells at Motherwell and Hibernian, before guiding Rangers to two championships and five cup wins in five years. McLeish spent ten months as manager of the Scotland national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the finals of the 2008 UEFA European championship. He then resigned this post in November 2007 to become manager of Birmingham City, who were in the Premier League at the time. Though Birmingham were relegated at the end of the season, McLeish guided them back to the Premier League in 2009. Birmingham then won the 2011 Football League Cup Final, but were relegated again from the Premier League at the end of the 2010–11 season.

Following this relegation he resigned his post at Birmingham to become manager at their city rivals, Aston Villa. This made him the first manager to move directly from Birmingham City to Aston Villa, and only the second manager after Ron Saunders to manage both clubs. Having only narrowly avoided relegation in the 2011–12 Premier League season, his contract was terminated by Villa at the end of his first season. McLeish was appointed manager of Championship club Nottingham Forest in December 2012, but left after 40 days by mutual consent. He managed Belgian Pro League club Genk in the 2014–15 season, and Zamalek of the Egyptian Premier League in 2016. He then had a second stint as Scotland national team manager.

In recognition of his distinguished service to Scottish sport, in 2008 McLeish was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen.

==Early years==
McLeish was born in Duke Street Hospital, Glasgow to parents Alex, a shipyard worker, and Jean. He has younger siblings Angela and Ian. After living in the Parkhead and Kinning Park districts of the city, the family moved to Barrhead, Renfrewshire soon after McLeish had reached school age. He attended Springhill Primary, Barrhead High School – where he was one year below future Aberdeen and Scotland teammate Peter Weir – and John Neilson High School in Paisley.

As a juvenile he played for Barrhead Youth Club, alongside Weir, and Glasgow United as well as training for a short period with Hamilton Accies. After a local cup final with Glasgow United in 1976 which was watched by a delegation from Aberdeen, including then manager Ally MacLeod, McLeish signed for the Pittodrie club the following day.

==Playing career==
===Club===
McLeish spent the majority of his first two seasons at Aberdeen in the reserves and also had a loan spell at local Junior side Lewis United. McLeish won the Scottish 2nd XI Cup with the &quot;Dons&quot; in 1978. He made his competitive debut under Billy McNeill in a New Year fixture against Dundee United on 2 January 1978. His first major final appearance was under the management of Alex Ferguson as a substitute in a 2–1 defeat to Rangers in the 1978–79 League Cup and most of his appearances during the 1970s were as a midfielder, with Willie Garner and Doug Rougvie preferred in defence. However McLeish eventually made the centre-back position his own, and over the next seven seasons he enjoyed great success, winning eight domestic and two European trophies. Highlights included scoring in a 4–1 victory over Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup Final on his 200th Dons appearance, and a vital goal against Bayern Munich during the campaign leading to the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup win over Real Madrid in 1983.

During this period, McLeish formed a formidable defensive triumvirate with Willie Miller and Jim Leighton for both club and country. Even after he had won his first Scotland cap, McLeish&#x27;s father asked then Aberdeen boss Alex Ferguson to persuade him to continue training as an accountant. When Ferguson left in 1986 to go to Manchester United, he tried to get McLeish to sign, but it did not work out; he also had talks with Tottenham Hotspur. A testimonial match was arranged for McLeish in December 1988, with the club&#x27;s &#x27;Gothenburg&#x27; (Cup Winners&#x27; Cup) squad taking on an &#x27;International legends&#x27; team. He won the Scottish player of the year in 1990, after a season in which Aberdeen won both domestic cups.

He became captain of Aberdeen after the retirement of Willie Miller. His 692 competitive appearances for the club ranks as the second-most in its history (100 behind Miller, but almost 100 more than Bobby Clark).

===International===
McLeish is Scotland&#x27;s third most capped player, having gained 77 international caps between 1980 and 1993. He was first capped for the Scotland under-21 team while still a reserve player at Aberdeen by his former club manager Ally MacLeod, eventually gaining six caps at that level. His full international debut came on 26 March 1980 against Portugal, manager Jock Stein playing him in midfield alongside Archie Gemmill and Graeme Souness. He played in three World Cups with Scotland, in 1982, 1986 and 1990. He is a member of the Scottish Football Hall of Fame, the Scotland national football team roll of honour and Scottish Television&#x27;s fan poll &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Greatest Team&quot;. On the occasion of his 50th cap, against Luxembourg in 1987, McLeish was appointed team captain for the game. His final cap came on 17 February 1993 in a 3–0 win over Malta at Hampden Park during the 1994 World Cup qualifiers.

==Management career==

===Motherwell===
After his successful playing career he quickly went into football management with Motherwell in 1994, one year before he retired as a player. His first season at Motherwell saw him take the Lanarkshire club to second in the Premier Division behind Walter Smith&#x27;s Rangers. However, he failed to build on this success and the next two seasons were spent in relegation battles. He resigned as manager to take over at Hibernian in 1998.

===Hibernian===
McLeish took over a struggling Hibernian side, which was relegated from the Scottish Premier Division in 1998 despite a slight upturn in fortunes under McLeish. He then guided the Edinburgh team back to the Scottish Premier League at the first attempt by winning the First Division championship.

Hibernian consolidated in their first season back in the top division, finishing mid-table and reaching the Scottish Cup semi-final. In the 2000–01 season, Hibs started very strongly. Eventually they had to settle for third place and a Scottish Cup final appearance. This performance attracted the attention of bigger clubs, including West Ham United and Rangers.

McLeish attracted players such as Russell Latapy and former French international Franck Sauzée to Hibs. He also helped develop young striker Kenny Miller, who would later go on to play 69 games for Scotland.

During this period McLeish worked towards and was awarded a UEFA Pro Licence.

===Rangers===
His work at Hibs was noticed, and he was linked with several moves to England, before he was appointed as Rangers manager in December 2001 after outgoing Rangers manager Dick Advocaat recommended McLeish to chairman David Murray.

McLeish was an instant success at Rangers, winning both the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup in his first season, but the big prize of the league title was essentially lost before his arrival. His second season saw him go one better when he won the domestic treble, with the help of players such as Ronald de Boer and Barry Ferguson.

Rangers&#x27; worsening financial state saw many of his top players leave in the summer of 2003. Celtic won the league comfortably in season 2003–04, and Rangers failed to win any trophies. McLeish was consequently put under pressure from fans after his poor signings and a record run of seven consecutive Old Firm derby losses to Celtic.

The high-profile Bosman signings of Jean-Alain Boumsong and Dado Pršo in the close season of 2004–05 gave Rangers renewed hope of regaining the title from Celtic&#x27;s grasp. McLeish&#x27;s team won the 2005 league title on a dramatic last day, an outcome that had looked highly unlikely after Rangers fell five points behind leaders Celtic with just four games remaining.

After this unexpected success, McLeish and his Rangers team headed into the 2005–06 SPL campaign as favourites to retain the championship. McLeish made a number of signings, including Julien Rodriguez and Ian Murray, despite having little money to spend. After a reasonable start to the season, including a win over Celtic, Rangers suffered a series of poor results between September and November. This period included a club record of 10 games without a win. However the tenth match of this run, a 1–1 draw with Inter Milan in the Champions League, took Rangers into the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time.

Despite the poor domestic form, McLeish guided Rangers to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they were defeated on the away goals rule by Villarreal. They became the first Scottish team to progress this far in the European Cup since 1993, and the first Scottish team to progress through a European group stage. In December, chairman David Murray publicly announced his support for McLeish. Rangers then went on a good run of results in December and January.

This run of good results came to a sudden halt when they were defeated 3–0 by Hibernian in the Scottish Cup, prompting protests outside Ibrox against both McLeish and David Murray. On 9 February 2006, it was announced by chairman David Murray that McLeish would be standing down as manager at the end of that season.

It was later announced that he would be succeeded by former Olympique Lyonnais manager Paul Le Guen. Rangers beat Hearts 2–0 at Ibrox Stadium in his final match as manager.

===Scotland national team===

McLeish said after leaving Rangers that he would not manage another Scottish club, because he felt that he had achieved everything in the Scottish game. He was linked in the media with a number of managerial positions in England while he worked as a television pundit for the BBC and Setanta Sports.

McLeish took charge of the Scotland national team on 29 January 2007. His assistants in the job were Roy Aitken and Andy Watson.
McLeish&#x27;s first game in charge of the national team was a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match, a 2–1 victory against Georgia on 24 March 2007 at Hampden Park. His second game was an away fixture against Italy on 28 March 2007 which ended in a 2–0 defeat.

McLeish&#x27;s Scotland side then went on to defeat the Faroe Islands away in June, Lithuania at home in September before recording a historic victory in Paris four days later by defeating France 1–0 in the Parc des Princes. James McFadden&#x27;s 64th-minute strike from 30 yards was enough to earn Scotland the win and returned them to the top of Group B with three games to play. This result has been hailed as one of the Scotland national team&#x27;s greatest victories. Scotland&#x27;s next success was at home to Ukraine, winning 3–1 at Hampden on 13 October. McLeish suffered his second defeat as manager, away in Georgia on 17 October. This result left Scotland facing a decider against the World Champions, Italy. Scotland lost the game 2–1, McLeish&#x27;s last, and Italy qualified for the finals.

===Birmingham City===
Premier League club Birmingham City&#x27;s approach to the SFA for permission to speak to McLeish about their managerial vacancy was refused,
but on his return on 27 November 2007 from attending the draw for 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification in South Africa, he resigned his post as manager of Scotland and was announced as Birmingham&#x27;s new manager the following day. His assistants with Scotland, Roy Aitken and Andy Watson, were to accompany him. McLeish said he wanted to return to working with players on a daily basis and had &quot;always harboured a desire&quot; to manage in the Premier League.

He enjoyed a positive managerial debut with Birmingham, winning 3–2 away to Tottenham Hotspur. In the January 2008 transfer window, McLeish strengthened Birmingham&#x27;s squad, buying David Murphy and James McFadden and signing Argentina under-20 international Mauro Zárate on loan, while generating funds by allowing fringe players to leave. He was unable to save Birmingham from relegation, despite the team recording an impressive 4–1 victory over Blackburn Rovers on the last day of the season.

McLeish changed the club&#x27;s backroom staff and training procedures, appointed David Watson as goalkeeping coach, and overhauled the scouting setup, bringing in Paul Montgomery – the scout who recommended a relatively unknown Didier Drogba to West Ham United – to oversee player recruitment.

On the final day of the 2008–09 season, McLeish secured Birmingham&#x27;s return to the top flight of English football at the first attempt with a 2–1 away victory over Reading. By mid-January 2010, he had guided them to a 12-game unbeaten run, a club record in the top division, set a Premier League record by selecting the same starting eleven for nine consecutive games, and been named Premier League Manager of the Month for December 2009, the first Birmingham manager to receive the award. By the end of the season McLeish had led Birmingham to ninth place, their highest finish for more than 50 years.

Following Birmingham&#x27;s success during the 2009–10 season, McLeish agreed a new three-year deal with the club in September 2010.
In February 2011, McLeish led Birmingham to victory in the League Cup, defeating favourites Arsenal 2–1 in the final at Wembley in what he described as &quot;relatively speaking, ... [his] greatest achievement&quot;.
However, a poor run of form followed the League Cup win, and Birmingham were relegated to the Championship on the last day of the 2010–11 season. The directors confirmed that McLeish would keep his job, and would be expected to return the club to the Premier League at the first opportunity. McLeish however opted to quit Birmingham City on 12 June 2011 by email.

===Aston Villa===
On 17 June 2011, Aston Villa appointed McLeish as manager, just five days after leaving their local rivals Birmingham City. There was much controversy surrounding his appointment as Birmingham City claimed McLeish was still under contract and filed a complaint against Aston Villa to the Premier League while Villa claimed McLeish was a free agent. Aston Villa fans protested outside Villa Park and anti-McLeish graffiti had to be removed from outside Villa&#x27;s training ground. McLeish made out of favour Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given his first signing, and then recruited winger Charles N&#x27;Zogbia. McLeish&#x27;s first competitive game as Villa manager ended in a 0–0 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage. He gained his first Premier League win as manager of Villa in a 3–1 win over Blackburn Rovers. Following victory over Blackburn, Villa drew their next four Premier League games until winning against Wigan 2–0. Aston Villa finally ended their unbeaten start with a 4–1 defeat away at Manchester City. McLeish&#x27;s side secured a surprise win over Chelsea just before signing LA Galaxy striker Robbie Keane on loan. Keane helped to secure Villa a crucial win against rivals Wolves in a 3–2 victory. McLeish led the 2011–12 Villa team to 16th place in the Premier League, avoiding relegation by two points, and set an unwanted club record of only four home wins. McLeish&#x27;s contract was terminated on 14 May, the day after the season ended. The reasons cited for his termination were the poor results and style of play used throughout his term as manager.

===Nottingham Forest===
McLeish was appointed manager of Football League Championship club Nottingham Forest on 27 December 2012. His first game in charge was on 29 December 2012, a 2–2 draw against Crystal Palace at the City Ground, with Billy Sharp scoring an injury-time equaliser for Nottingham Forest. McLeish earned his first win as Nottingham Forest manager on 12 January 2013, a 2–1 victory against Peterborough at home. McLeish took charge of his only East Midlands derby against Derby County on 19 January 2013, drawing 1–1 at Pride Park.

On 2 February 2013, after a 2–1 defeat to former club Birmingham City on his first return to St Andrew&#x27;s, he refused to commit his future to Nottingham Forest and claimed he was unhappy. This came after the Nottingham Forest board pulled out of a deal to sign George Boyd on the final day of the January transfer window. On 5 February 2013, he left the club by mutual consent.

===Genk===
McLeish stated in November 2013 that he would like to re-enter football management in some capacity, in England, Scotland or abroad. In August 2014, he was appointed manager of Belgian club Genk. McLeish made his managerial debut on 30 August, in which Genk drew Oostende 1–1 away. It was reported in March 2015 that McLeish would leave Genk at the end of the 2014–15 Belgian Pro League season, as the club had failed to qualify for the Championship play-offs, although they did reach Europa League play-offs.

===Zamalek===
McLeish was appointed manager of Egyptian Premier League club Zamalek on 28 February 2016. After a series of poor performances from the team, he was sacked on 2 May with ten matches of the season remaining.

===Scotland national team (second spell)===
McLeish was reappointed Scotland manager on 16 February 2018, on a two-year contract. Scotland won their 2018–19 UEFA Nations League group under McLeish, but he was sacked on 18 April 2019 following a 3–0 defeat by Kazakhstan. Scotland&#x27;s Nations League success under McLeish contributed to Scotland qualifying for UEFA Euro 2020, their first major tournament in 22 years. During his tenure, McLeish also convinced Scott McTominay to play for Scotland.

==Outside of football==
McLeish had a cameo appearance in the Laurel and Hardy biopic &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot;, after a chance meeting with director and Aberdeen FC fan Jon S. Baird on a flight. In the film, McLeish can be briefly seen reading a newspaper in the lobby of the Savoy Hotel behind Steve Coogan.

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum McLeish was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

McLeish was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to charity.

<doc id="795651" wikidata="Q2039061" url="?curid=795651" title="Windbreak">
<text>A windbreak (shelterbelt) is a planting usually made up of one or more rows of trees or shrubs planted in such a manner as to provide shelter from the wind and to protect soil from erosion. They are commonly planted in hedgerows around the edges of fields on farms. If designed properly, windbreaks around a home can reduce the cost of heating and cooling and save energy. Windbreaks are also planted to help keep snow from drifting onto roadways or yards. Farmers sometimes use windbreaks to keep snow drifts on farm land that will provide water when the snow melts in the spring. Other benefits include contributing to a microclimate around crops (with slightly less drying and chilling at night), providing habitat for wildlife, and, in some regions, providing wood if the trees are harvested.

Windbreaks and intercropping can be combined in a farming practice referred to as alley cropping, or being deployed along riparian buffer stripes. Fields are planted in rows of different crops surrounded by rows of trees. These trees provide fruit, wood, or protect the crops from the wind. Alley cropping has been particularly successful in India, Africa, and Brazil, where coffee growers have combined farming and forestry.

A further use for a shelterbelt is to screen a farm from a main road or motorway. This improves the farm landscape by reducing the visual incursion of the motorway, mitigating noise from the traffic and providing a safe barrier between farm animals and the road.

Fences called &quot;windbreaks&quot; are also used. Normally made from cotton, nylon, canvas, and recycled sails, windbreaks tend to have three or more panels held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the panel. The poles are then hammered into the ground and a windbreak is formed. Windbreaks or &quot;wind fences&quot; are used to reduce wind speeds over erodible areas such as open fields, industrial stockpiles, and dusty industrial operations. As erosion is proportional to wind speed cubed, a reduction of wind speed of 1/2 (for example) will reduce erosion by 87.5%.

Sheltered, windless areas created by windbreaks are called wind shadows.

Windbreaks can mitigate the effects of pesticide drift.

== Windbreak aerodynamics ==
When wind encounters a porous obstacle, such as a windbreak or shelterbelt, air pressure increases on the windward side and decreases on the leeward side. As a result, the airstream approaching the barrier is interrupted, and a portion of it moves over the barrier, resulting in a jet of higher wind speed. The remainder of the airstream then moves through the barrier to its edge downstream, pushed along by the decrease in pressure across the shelterbelt&#x27;s width; as it emerges again, that airstream is interrupted further as its air pressure adjusts to the surrounding area. This results in slower wind speed further downwind, reaching a minimum at a distance of about 3 to 5 times the windbreak&#x27;s height. Beyond that point wind speed recovers, aided by the overlying, faster-moving stream. From the perspective of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, these effects can be understood as resulting from the loss of momentum caused by the drag of leaves and branches and would be represented by the body force &quot;fi&quot; (a distributed momentum sink).

Windbreaks reduce the wind&#x27;s average air speed and make it less variable, resulting in the wind mixing less effectively than it does upwind. Additionally, all these changes to the wind&#x27;s behavior result in changes to the region&#x27;s environment. For instance, the surface energy budget of the ground may be impacted, as the slowed wind dissipates heat from the sun less effectively; this trend may reverse further downwind, and about 8 times the windbreak&#x27;s height downstream, the windbreak may result in cooler surface temperatures.

== Windbreak organizations ==
* The Great Plains Shelterbelt was an American initiative to create shelterbelts on the prairies in the USA during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.
* The Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration in Indian Head, Saskatchewan, Canada, subsidized seedlings to prairie farmers for almost 100 years to reduce soil erosion and increase quality of life on the prairies.

<doc id="795668" wikidata="Q177372" url="?curid=795668" title="M72 LAW">
<text>The M72 LAW (light anti-tank weapon, also referred to as the light anti-armor weapon or LAW as well as LAWS: light anti-armor weapons system) is a portable one-shot unguided anti-tank weapon. 

In early 1963, the M72 LAW was adopted by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps as their primary individual infantry anti-tank weapon, replacing the M31 HEAT rifle grenade and the M20A1 &quot;Super Bazooka&quot; in the U.S. Army. It was subsequently adopted by the U.S. Air Force to serve in an anti-emplacement and anti-armor role in airbase defense.

In the early 1980s, the M72 was slated to be replaced by the FGR-17 Viper. However, the Viper program was canceled by Congress and the M136 AT4 was adopted instead. At that time, its nearest equivalents were the Swedish Pskott m/68 (Miniman) and the French SARPAC.

==Background==
The increased importance of tanks and other armored vehicles in World War II caused a need for portable infantry weapons to deal with them. The first to be used (with varying successes) were Molotov cocktails, flamethrowers, satchel charges, jury-rigged landmines, and specially designed magnetic hollow charges. All of these had to be used within a few meters of the target, which was difficult and dangerous.

The U.S. Army introduced the bazooka, the first rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Despite early problems, it was a success and was copied by other countries.

However, the bazooka had its drawbacks. Large and easily damaged, it required a well-trained two-man crew. Germany developed a one-man alternative, the Panzerfaust, having single-shot launchers that were cheap and requiring no special training. As a result, they were regularly issued to &quot;Volkssturm&quot; home guard regiments. They were very efficient against tanks during the last days of World War II.

The M72 LAW is a combination of the two World War II weapons. The basic principle is a miniaturized bazooka, while its light weight and cheapness rival the Panzerfaust.

==Development and production==
The solid rocket propulsion unit was developed in the newly formed Rohm and Haas research laboratory at Redstone Arsenal in 1959, and the full system was designed by Paul V. Choate, Charles B. Weeks, Frank A. Spinale, et al. at the Hesse-Eastern Division of Norris Thermador. American production of the weapon began by Hesse-Eastern in 1963, and was terminated by 1983; currently it is produced by Nammo Raufoss AS in Norway and their subsidiary, Nammo Defense Systems (formerly Nammo Talley Inc.) in Arizona.

==Description==
The weapon consists of a rocket within a launcher consisting of two tubes, one inside the other. While closed, the outer assembly serves as a watertight container for the rocket and the percussion-cap firing mechanism that activates the rocket. The outer tube contains the trigger, the arming handle, front and rear sights, and the rear cover. The inner tube contains the channel assembly, which houses the firing pin assembly, including the detent lever. When extended, the inner tube telescopes outward toward the rear, guided by the channel assembly, which rides in an alignment slot in the outer tube&#x27;s trigger housing assembly. This causes the detent lever to move under the trigger assembly in the outer tube, both locking the inner tube in the extended position and cocking the weapon. Once armed, the weapon is no longer watertight, even if the launcher is collapsed into its original configuration. It is a line of sight weapon with a range around .

When fired, the striker in the rear tube impacts a primer, which ignites a small amount of powder that &quot;flashes&quot; down a tube to the rear of the rocket and ignites the propellant in the rocket motor. The rocket motor burns completely before leaving the mouth of the launcher, producing a backblast of gases around . The rocket propels the warhead forward without significant recoil. As the warhead emerges from the launcher, six fins spring out from the base of the rocket tube, stabilizing the warhead&#x27;s flight. The early LAW warhead, developed from the M31 HEAT rifle grenade warhead, uses a simple piezoelectric fuze system. On impact with the target, the front of the nose section is crushed, causing a microsecond electric current to be generated, which detonates a booster charge located in the base of the warhead, which sets off the main warhead charge. The force of the main charge forces the copper liner into a directional particle jet that, in relation to the size of the warhead, is capable of a massive penetration.

A unique mechanical set-back safety on the base of the detonator grounds the circuit until the missile has accelerated out of the tube. The acceleration causes the three disks in the safety mechanism to rotate 90° in succession, ungrounding the circuit; the circuit from the nose to the base of the detonator is then completed when the piezoelectric crystal is crushed on impact.
The weapon can be fired from inside buildings as long as the structures are at least in size, which is about in volume, and have sufficient ventilation. The Department of the Army previously rated the weapon as safe to fire from enclosure, but this rating was removed in 2010 after the introduction of the safer AT4 CS. However, some modern variants of the LAW are specifically designed with fire-from-enclosure (FFE) capability.

In late 2021, Nammo unveiled the concept of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a LAW. The tube is mounted facing downward, enabling the drone operator to fire on tanks and armored vehicles from a top attack position while remaining away.

==Ammunition==
M72 LAWs were issued as prepackaged rounds of ammunition. Improvements to the launcher and differences in the ammunition were differentiated by a single designation. The original M72 warhead penetrated of armor.

A training variant of the M72 LAW, designated &quot;M190&quot;, also exists. This weapon is reloadable and uses the &quot;M73&quot; training rocket. A subcaliber training device that uses a special tracer cartridge also exists for the M72. A training variant used by the Finnish armed forces fires tracer rounds.

The US Army tested other 66 mm rockets based on the &quot;M54&quot; rocket motor used for the M72. The &quot;M74 TPA&quot; (thickened pyrophoric agent) had an incendiary warhead filled with TEA (triethylaluminum); this was used in the M202A1 FLASH (flame assault shoulder weapon) four-tube launcher. The &quot;XM96 RCR&quot; (riot control rocket) had a CS gas-filled warhead for crowd control and was also intended for use with the M202, though the rocket never entered service.

==Service history==

===Australia===
The M72 rocket has been in Australian service since the Vietnam War. Currently, the Australian Defence Force uses the M72A6 variant, known as the &quot;light direct fire support weapon&quot;, as an anti-structure and secondary anti-armor weapon. The weapon is used by ordinary troops at the section (squad) level and complements the heavier Carl Gustav recoilless rifle and Javelin missile, which are generally used by specialized fire support and anti-armor troops.

===Canada===
As of 21 February 2023, Canada has supplied 4,500 M72s to Ukraine for use in the Russo-Ukrainian War. These are of the &quot;M72A5-C1&quot; designation.

===Finland===
The M72 LAW is used in the Finnish Army (some 70,000 pieces), where it is known under the designations &quot;66 KES 75&quot; (M72A2, no longer in service) and &quot;66 KES 88&quot; (M72A5). In accordance with the weapon&#x27;s known limitations, a pair of &quot;tank-buster&quot; troops crawl to a firing position around away from the target, bringing with them four to six LAWs, which are then used in rapid succession until the target is destroyed or incapacitated. Due to its low penetration capability, it is used mostly against lightly armored targets. The M72 is the most common anti-tank weapon in the Finnish Army. Finland has recently upgraded its stocks to the M72 EC LAW Mk.I version. It is designated &quot;66 KES 12&quot; Claimed penetration for the M72 EC LAW is of rolled homogeneous armor steel plate, nearly twice that of the M72A2. It also fields the bunker-buster version that contains of DPX-6 explosive, named M72 ASM RC, and locally designated &quot;66 KES 12 RAK&quot;. The oldest version of the 66 KES 75 is now retired.

=== Israel ===
First arriving in Israel during The Yom Kippur War as part of Operation Nickel Grass, the LAW is the primary light anti tank weapon of the Israeli infantry, and has been used extensively throughout the different wars and conflicts, including the current Israel–Hamas war.

===Norway===
In late February 2022, the Norwegian government announced that it intended to donate &quot;up to 2,000&quot; M72 LAW units from their reserve stocks to Ukraine, in response to the Russian invasion. On March 30, 2022, the Norwegian Defence Ministry said that 2,000 more units will be sent to Ukraine.

===Taiwan===
The Republic of China Army (Taiwan) uses the M72 as a secondary anti-armor weapon for infantry units. It is used primarily as a backup to the Javelin and BGM-71 TOW anti-tank weapons. The weapon was later reverse-engineered into the &quot;Type 1 66 mm anti-armor rocket&quot;, which was introduced from M72 A2, but is more-popularly nicknamed as the &quot;Type 66 rocket&quot; due to its caliber. After several decades of application, the Type 66mm anti-armor rocket has evolved into Kestrel (67mm) model since 2008.

===Turkey===
The Turkish Army uses a locally built version by Makina ve Kimya Endustrisi Kurumu, called HAR-66 (&quot;Hafif Antitank Roketi&quot;, &#x27;light antitank rocket&#x27;), which has the performance and characteristics of a mix of an M72A2 and an A3. Turkey also indigenously developed an anti-personnel warhead version of HAR-66 AP and called it &quot;Eşek Arısı&quot; (&#x27;wasp&#x27;).

===United Kingdom===

The British Army employed the NAMMO M72, designated as the &quot;Rocket 66 mm HEAT L1A1,&quot; until it was phased out and replaced by the LAW 80 in the 1980s. The M72 saw active use during the 1982 Falklands War, where it was primarily utilized to suppress Argentine defensive positions at close range. Additionally, it was deployed against an assault amphibious vehicle during the initial invasion and played a role in damaging the Argentine warship during the invasion of South Georgia.

Under the 2012 Urgent Operational Requirement program, the M72 was reintroduced into British service, with the M72A9 variant being designated as the Light Anti-Structure Munition (LASM).

===United States===

During the Vietnam and post-Vietnam periods, all issued LAWs were recalled after instances of the warhead exploding in flight, sometimes injuring the operator. After safety improvements, part of the training and firing drills included the requirement to ensure that the words &quot;w/coupler&quot; were included in the text description stenciled on the launcher, which indicated that the launcher had the required safety modifications.

With the failure of the M72&#x27;s intended replacement, the Viper, in late 1982 Congress ordered the US Army to test off-the-shelf light antitank weapons and report back by the end of 1983. In partnership with Raufoss AS, Talley Defense offered the M72E4, which provided increased range, velocity, and better sights; this was tested by the U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) along with other light anti-armor weapons in 1985. Despite the velocity and range improvements of the M72E4, the AT4 still had a higher hit probability due to its higher velocity and range. Therefore, the AT4 was chosen to replace the M72, instead of the improved M72E4 LAW.

Although generally considered a Vietnam War–era weapon that had been superseded by the more powerful AT4, the M72 LAW remained in service with the U.S. military for some time due to existing stockpiles and the U.S. Air Force continuing to purchase M72A3 LAWs until at least 2009. The LAW also found new popularity in operations with the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps, and Canadian Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. The lower cost and lighter weight of the LAW, combined with a scarcity of modern heavy armored targets and the need for an individual assault weapon versus an individual anti-armor weapon, made it ideal for the type of urban combat seen in Iraq and mountain warfare seen in Afghanistan. In addition, a soldier can carry two LAWs on a mission as opposed to a single AT4.

In February 2005, The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) issued a solicitation to procure 2,558 M72A7 66mm HE LAW w/Graze Fuze Function and NVD Mount with the award date estimated as mid-May 2005. U.S. Marine Corps officials also identified the M72A7 LAW as an urgent requirement in support of the global war on terrorism, with the USMC initally purchasing 1,136 M72A7s in 2005. The U.S. Marine Corps increased M72A7 LAW purchases after 2005, with the service purchasing about 23,000 over a three-year period from 2007 to 2009. Later in 2010, the U.S. Army also began using the M72A7 LAW in Afghanistan because it was found to be a useful small and lightweight rocket system for engaging short- and medium-range targets. Foot patrols particularly benefited from it due to Afghanistan&#x27;s difficult terrain and high elevations. The U.S. Marine Corps was still purchasing M72A7 LAW rockets as of March 2023.

The M72A7 LAW is an improved version of its predecessors, featuring an enhanced rocket motor that increases velocity to for greater accuracy beyond 200 meters (660 feet), a Picatinny rail for mounting laser pointers and night sights, and the warhead contains a copper explosively formed penetrator (EFP), instead of a conical shaped charge. While the EFP has reduced penetration compared to the previous LAWs with a conical shaped charge, it creates a larger diameter hole, resulting in greater spalling inside armored vehicles and increased fragmentation behind urban walls, making it more destructive overall. Safety was also improved with an insensitive munition warhead to reduce the risk of accidental detonation. In May of 2024, Marine Corps Systems Command announced the acquisition of the M72 Light Assault Weapon (LAW) Fire from Enclosure (FFE) Munition. It features an improved launcher with an enhanced in-line trigger mechanism and an upgraded sling design for better handling. The M72 FFE has two configurations: the M72A8 anti-armor and the M72A10 multi-purpose, anti-structure munition. The M72A8 contains a high-explosive anti-armor warhead with improved armor penetration, while the M72A10 provides Marines with the added capability of an anti-structure round designed to eliminate hardened structures such as buildings. The M72A10 features an advanced warhead design with a multipurpose explosive and a self-discriminating fuse that automatically operates in either a fast- or delay-mode depending on the target’s construction, allowing Marines to effectively engage structures, bunkers, and enemy personnel. The FFE variants are no longer classified as rocket launchers, as they lack a rocket motor. Instead, they function as recoilless launchers, using a propellant charge to propel a 66mm fin-stabilized ballistic projectile toward the target. A liquid counter-mass behind the propellant mitigates backblast, allowing the weapon to be safely fired from enclosed spaces. The M72 FFE replaces the M72A7 LAW, allowing Marines to fire multiple shots daily from enclosed spaces without risk of brain injury. It also produces less muzzle flash than an M9 pistol, reducing its visual and thermal signature. With these improvements, both M72 FFE variants significantly enhance infantry effectiveness against armored vehicles and fortified structures, in urban environments as well as complex terrain. Fielding is expected to begin in 2024.

===Vietnam===
Several M72A1 and M72A2 LAWs captured during the Vietnam War have been put into service with the chemical force of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army. The launchers are upgraded to be able to fire multiple times and are armed with M74 incendiary rounds.

<text>David James Abbruzzese (; born May 17, 1968) is an American musician who was the drummer for the American rock band Pearl Jam from 1991 to 1994. He replaced drummer Matt Chamberlain in 1991, shortly before the release of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ten&quot;. Abbruzzese played on the band&#x27;s following records, &quot;Vs.&quot; and &quot;Vitalogy&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dave Abbruzzese was born in Stamford, Connecticut, and grew up in Mesquite, Texas, where he attended Vanston Jr. High. Abbruzzese grew up drumming on his dad&#x27;s tackle boxes. While living at home the only thing in his bedroom (besides a bed) was his drum set. Abbruzzese dropped out of North Mesquite High School at an early age and began to focus on playing more than ever. He started playing in the Texas music scene, performing in such bands as Segueway, Flaming Hemorrhoids, and Course of Empire, and along the way, he formed a band called Dr. Tongue, a three-piece, funk-influenced band that gigged in the Dallas and Denton area.

===Pearl Jam===

In 1991, Abbruzzese got a call from drummer and friend Matt Chamberlain, whom Abbruzzese knew through the Texas music scene, in regard to filling in for him in the band Pearl Jam when he left. Chamberlain had his eyes set on G. E. Smith&#x27;s band on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Abbruzzese left for Seattle, Washington to meet and become acquainted with the members of Pearl Jam. Although his musical tastes were far different from the other members, Abbruzzese chose to join Pearl Jam, playing his first show on August 23, 1991. Initially, Abbruzzese was reluctant to join the band full-time. Then after his second show with Pearl Jam, Abbruzzese went straight down to his local tattoo parlor and had bassist Jeff Ament&#x27;s stick figure drawing from the sleeve of the &quot;Alive&quot; single tattooed onto his left shoulder. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam&#x27;s live shows supporting the &quot;Ten&quot; album. Abbruzzese toured extensively for &quot;Ten&quot; and performed on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; and a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance. Abbruzzese made his studio debut with Pearl Jam when the band released the single &quot;Even Flow&quot; in April 1992. They re-recorded the song for its single release with Abbruzzese on drums instead of original drummer Dave Krusen. Two songs for the &quot;Singles Soundtrack&quot; and the b-side &quot;Dirty Frank&quot; also came from the same recording session. The band found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene and the genre known as grunge.

With Abbruzzese, the band recorded its second studio album, &quot;Vs.&quot;, released in 1993. Upon its release, &quot;Vs.&quot; set at the time the record for most copies of an album sold in a week, and spent five weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Vs.&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. From &quot;Vs.&quot;, the song &quot;Daughter&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and the song &quot;Go&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. Abbruzzese toured extensively for &quot;Vs.&quot; and performed on a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance. Abbruzzese wrote the music for the Pearl Jam songs &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Last Exit&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; (from the 1993 fan club Christmas single). He played with Pearl Jam through April 17, 1994. In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. Although Abbruzzese performed on the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, he was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members, four months before the album was released. Ament stated, &quot;Dave was a different egg for sure. There were a lot of things, personality wise, where I didn&#x27;t see eye to eye with him. He was more comfortable being a rock star than the rest of us. Partying, girls, cars. I don&#x27;t know if anyone was in the same space.&quot; Guitarist Stone Gossard said, &quot;It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, &#x27;Hey, we tried, it&#x27;s not working; time to move on.&#x27; On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don&#x27;t think it was all Dave Abbruzzese&#x27;s fault that it was stifled.&quot; Abbruzzese stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t really agree with what was going on. I didn&#x27;t agree with the Ticketmaster stuff at all. But I don&#x27;t blame anyone or harbor any hard feelings. I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t furious and hurt for a long time. But now I just wish there was more music from the band I was a part of.&quot;

On October 18, 2016, Pearl Jam was named among the 2017 class of nominees for induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In a departure from the protocol of previous years, the Hall named which specific former members would be inducted from each nominated band. The only former member of Pearl Jam to be included was Dave Krusen. Reacting to the snub, Abbruzzese stated &quot;The members of Pearl Jam have got to know what&#x27;s the right thing to do. They can&#x27;t justify ignoring my contributions. Like me or not. If there is still a part of that band that remembers how hard we worked, how much blood and how much sweat ... They will do the right thing.&quot; He further stated &quot;It’s just a fine opportunity to see what Pearl Jam has to say in response. Let’s see if they do the right thing. It’ll be interesting to see the spin that is put on it. That band and its management have never been ones to shy away when an injustice is done. Let’s see if they still have the courage to fight the good fight!&quot;

Pearl Jam later responded with an open letter on Facebook inviting all their former drummers, including Matt Chamberlain and Jack Irons, to the induction. 

==Other musical projects==
On September 30, 1997, Abbruzzese&#x27;s newly formed band, the Green Romance Orchestra, released &quot;Play Parts I &amp; V&quot;. The album saw Abbruzzese bring his own songs to the drawing board, as well as play the role of a producer. &quot;Play Parts I &amp; V&quot; is a release of Free Association Records, which was formed by Abbruzzese in 1996. In 1997, Abbruzzese rehearsed with Axl Rose during the making of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; 2008 album, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. However, none of the material from the sessions ended up on the album.

Afterward, Abbruzzese worked with HairyApesBMX. He mixed, produced, and engineered the band&#x27;s 2000 album, &quot;Out Demons&quot;. Abbruzzese also lent the band a hand behind his drum kit on its Midwestern tour. Abbruzzese drummed on the IMF tour with Jara Harris, Stevie Salas, and Bernard Fowler in early 2016. Abbruzzese has also collaborated with Shawn Smith of Brad and Satchel. They released their song &quot;Like the Child of The Water I Am&quot; for online download on December 26, 2015, and stated that their collaboration is ongoing and more music would be released in 2016.

Dave Abbruzzese is also part of the Indian multi-city grunge outfit Pseutopia, featuring Laji George on Vocals, Shyam Narayan on Bass, and Mithun Raju (from Thaikkudam Bridge) on Guitars. His first track with Pseutopia was a tribute to Chris Cornell&#x27;s track &quot;Seasons&quot; that was released on YouTube on December 18, 2018. Since then Pseutopia has released their second track &quot;Brother&quot; on May 12, 2022.

==Musical style and influences==
Abbruzzese has cited John Bonham, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as influences. Abbruzzese&#x27;s trademarks include heavy use of splash cymbals, the double-stroke roll, and a fast right foot. Abbruzzese refused to use two bass drums or a double-kick pedal, instead concentrating on playing the best he could with a single pedal. Abbruzzese is also known to be a particularly hard hitter, which may be reflected in him having suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome at one time.

==Equipment==
On his earlier, pre-&quot;Vs.&quot; Pearl Jam recordings, such as the tracks recorded for &quot;&quot; and the video version of &quot;Even Flow&quot;, Abbruzzese is known to have used Ludwig drums. As of the &quot;Vs.&quot; record, he endorsed and used Drum Workshop drums, Sabian cymbals, and seemed to favor an 8x12 Brady snare drum. Abbruzzese also had his own line of signature drumsticks, manufactured and marketed by Pro-Mark, but the model bearing his name appears to have been discontinued.

==Personal life==
Abbruzzese married Laura Whisman, on September 2, 2006; they later separated.

<doc id="795680" wikidata="Q488978" url="?curid=795680" title="Windows NT 4.0">
<text>Windows NT 4.0 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft and oriented towards businesses. It is the direct successor to Windows NT 3.51, and was released to manufacturing on July 31, 1996, and then to retail in August 24, 1996, with the Server versions released to retail in September 1996. 

Windows NT 4.0 is a preemptively multitasked, 32-bit operating system that is designed to work with either uniprocessor or symmetric multi-processor computers. It was Microsoft&#x27;s primary business-oriented operating system until the introduction of Windows 2000. Workstation, server and embedded editions were sold, and all editions feature a graphical user interface similar to that of Windows 95. Windows NT 4.0 was the last public release of Windows for the Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC architectures.

Mainstream support for Windows NT 4.0 Workstation ended on June 30, 2002, following by extended support ending on June 30, 2004. Windows NT 4.0 Server mainstream support ended on December 31, 2002, with extended support ending on December 31, 2004. Windows NT 4.0 Embedded mainstream support ended on June 30, 2003, followed by extended support on July 11, 2006. These editions were succeeded by Windows 2000 Professional, the Windows 2000 Server Family and Windows XP Embedded, respectively.

==Overview==
The successor to Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0 introduced the user interface of Windows 95 to the Windows NT family, including the Windows shell, File Explorer (known as Windows NT Explorer at the time), and the use of &quot;My&quot; nomenclature for shell folders (e.g. My Computer). It also includes most components introduced with Windows 95. Internally, Windows NT 4.0 was known as the Shell Update Release (SUR). While many administrative tools, notably &quot;User Manager for Domains&quot;, &quot;Server Manager&quot; and &quot;Domain Name Service Manager&quot; still used the old graphical user interfaces, the Start menu in Windows NT 4.0 separated the per-user shortcuts and folders from the shared shortcuts and folders by a separator line. Windows NT 4.0 includes some enhancements from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 such as the &quot;Space Cadet&quot; pinball table, font smoothing, showing window contents while dragging, high-color icons and stretching the wallpaper to fit the screen. Windows Desktop Update could also be installed on Windows NT 4.0 to update the shell version and install Task Scheduler. Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit included the Desktop Themes utility.

Windows NT 4.0 is the last major release of Microsoft Windows to support the Alpha, MIPS or PowerPC CPU architectures as Windows 2000 runs solely on IA-32 only. It remained in use by businesses for a number of years, despite Microsoft&#x27;s many efforts to get customers to upgrade to Windows 2000 and newer versions. It was also the last release in the Windows NT family to be branded as &quot;Windows NT&quot; although Windows 2000 carried the designation &quot;Built on NT Technology&quot;.

==Features==
Although the chief enhancement has been the addition of the Windows 95 shell, there are several major performance, scalability and feature improvements to the core architecture, kernel, USER32, COM and MSRPC. Windows NT 4.0 also introduced the concept of &quot;system policies&quot; and the System Policy Editor.

Other important features were:

* Crypto API
* Telephony API 2.0 with limited Unimodem support, which was the first release of TAPI on Windows NT
* DCOM and new OLE features
* Microsoft Transaction Server for network applications
* Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ), which improved interprocess communication
* Winsock 2 and the TCP/IP stack improvements
* File system defragmentation support
The server editions of Windows NT 4.0 include Internet Information Services 2.0, Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, NetShow Services, Remote Access Service (which includes a PPTP server for VPN functionality) and Multi-Protocol Routing service. There are new administrative wizards and a lite version of the Network Monitor utility shipped with System Management Server. The Enterprise edition introduced Microsoft Cluster Server.

One significant difference from previous versions of Windows NT is that the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is moved into kernel mode rather than being in user mode in the CSRSS process. This eliminated a process-to-process context switch in calling GDI functions, resulting in a significant performance improvement over Windows NT 3.51, particularly in the graphical user interface. This, however, also mandated that graphics and printer drivers had to run in kernel mode as well, resulting in potential stability issues.

Windows NT 4.0 was the first release of Microsoft Windows to include DirectX as standard—version 2 shipped with the initial release of Windows NT 4.0, and version 3 was included with the release of Service Pack 3 in mid-1997. However advanced hardware accelerated Direct3D and DirectSound multimedia features were never available on Windows NT 4.0. Later versions of DirectX were not released for Windows NT 4.0. However, OpenGL was supported; it was used by &quot;Quake 3&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;.

In early releases of 4.0, numerous stability issues did occur as graphics and printer vendors had to change their drivers to be compatible with the kernel mode interfaces exported by GDI. The change to move the GDI to run in the same process context as its caller was prompted by complaints from NT Workstation users about real-time graphics performance, but this change put a considerable onus on hardware manufacturers to update device drivers.

Windows NT 4.0 also included a new Windows Task Manager utility. Previous versions of Windows NT included the Task List utility, but it only shows applications currently on the desktop. To monitor CPU and memory usage, users were forced to use Performance Monitor. The task manager offers a more convenient way of getting a snapshot of all the processes running on the system at any given time.

Internet Explorer 2 was bundled with Windows NT 4. The installation of Internet Explorer 4 on Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3 or later) gave Windows NT 4.0 Active Desktop and browser integration into Windows Explorer, known as the Windows Desktop Update.

Windows NT 4.0 upgraded NTVDM&#x27;s x86 emulation in the RISC versions from 286 to 486. Sysprep was introduced as a deployment tool with Windows NT 4.0.

x86 versions of Windows NT 4.0 require the BIOS firmware. RISC versions of Windows NT 4.0 require the ARC firmware.

== System requirements ==
==Comparison with Windows 95==
Windows NT 4.0, like previous versions of Windows NT before it and versions after it, is a fully 32-bit OS, while Windows 95 is a 16/32-bit hybrid OS.

While providing much greater stability than Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0 was less flexible from a desktop perspective. Much of the stability was gained through the use of protected memory and the hardware abstraction layer. Direct hardware access was disallowed and &quot;misbehaving&quot; programs were terminated without needing the computer to be restarted. The trade-off was that NT required much more memory (32 MB for normal desktop use, 128 MB or more for heavy 3D applications) in comparison to consumer targeted products such as Windows 95.

While nearly all programs written for Windows 95 run on Windows NT, many 3D games would not, partly because of limited DirectX support for Windows NT 4.0. Third-party device drivers were an alternative to access the hardware directly, but poorly written drivers became a frequent source of the infamous error known as the Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) that would require the system to be restarted.

In spite of shipping a year later than Windows 95, by default there is no Legacy Plug and Play support and no Device Manager on Windows NT 4.0, which greatly simplifies installation of hardware devices (although limited support could be installed later). Many basic DOS programs would run; however, graphical DOS programs would not run because of the way they accessed graphics hardware. Although Windows NT 4.0 introduced an application programming interface (API) for defragmentation, there was no built-in defragmentation utility, unlike Windows 95. Also, Windows NT 4.0 lacked USB support, a preliminary version of which would be added to OEM editions of Windows 95 in OSR 2.1. AGP support can be added with SP3 or later. Large disk (&gt; 8 GB) support can be added with SP4 or later. FAT32 is not officially supported by Windows NT 4.0.

The difference between the NT family and 9x family would remain until the release of Windows XP in 2001. At that time, the APIs — such as OpenGL and DirectX — had matured sufficiently to be more efficient to write for common PC hardware, and the hardware itself had become powerful enough to handle the API processing overhead.

The maximum amount of supported physical random-access memory (RAM) in Windows NT 4.0 is 4 GB, which is the maximum possible for a 32-bit operating system that does not support PAE. By comparison, Windows 95 fails to boot on computers with more than approximately 480 MB of memory.

Like previous versions of NT, version 4.0 can run on multiple processor architectures. Windows 95, however, can only run on x86.

==Editions==

Windows NT 4.0 Server was included in versions 4.0 and 4.5 of BackOffice Small Business Server suite.

===Client===
* Windows NT 4.0 Workstation was designed for use as the general business desktop operating system.

===Servers===
* Windows NT 4.0 Server, released in 1996, was designed for small-scale business server systems.
* Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition, released in 1997, is the precursor to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; line of the Windows server family (&quot;Advanced Server&quot; in Windows 2000). Enterprise Server was designed for high-demand, high-traffic networks. Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition includes Service Pack 3. The Enterprise Edition saw the introduction of the boot flag, which changed the default virtual address space mapping from 2 GB kernel and 2 GB user space to 1 GB kernel and 3 GB userland. This version also sees the first introduction of cluster service.
* Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, (known as Windows-based Terminal Server 4.0 and Windows Terminal Server 4.0 in beta builds) released on June 16, 1998, allows the users to log on remotely. The same functionality was called &quot;Terminal Services&quot; in Windows 2000 and later server releases, and also powers the &quot;Remote Desktop&quot; feature that first appeared in Windows XP and later versions of Windows. Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, like Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition, includes Service Pack 3.

===Embedded===
* Windows NT 4.0 Embedded (abbreviated NTe) is an edition of Windows NT 4.0 that was aimed at computer-powered major appliances, vending machines, ATMs and other devices that cannot be considered general-purpose computers per se. It is the same system as the standard Windows NT 4.0, but it comes packaged in a database of components and dependencies, from which a developer can choose individual components to build customized setup CDs and hard disk boot images. Windows NT 4.0 Embedded includes Service Pack 5. It was succeeded by Windows XP Embedded. Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows NT 4.0 Embedded on June 30, 2003, and received three years of extended support, which means that support for Windows NT 4.0 Embedded ended on the same day support for Windows 98 and Windows Me ended on July 11, 2006.

==Upgradeability==
An &quot;Option Pack&quot; was available as a free-bundled CD starting around 1998, which included IIS 4.0 with Active Server Pages, FrontPage Server Extensions, Certificate Server, MTS, MSMQ, CDONTS, Internet Authentication Service (IAS), Indexing Service, Microsoft Management Console 1.0, Microsoft Site Server, SMTP and NNTP services and other new software. It is the only Option Pack to be released, as most of its features have been integrated into Windows 2000.

Several features such as Distributed File System and Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) were delivered as addons for Windows NT Server 4.0. The Routing and Remote Access Service was also a downloadable feature which replaced Windows NT 4.0&#x27;s separate RAS and Multi-Protocol Routing services.

The last version of Microsoft Office to be compatible with Windows NT 4.0 is Office XP. Similarly, Windows Media Player 7.0 (which was released in June 2000) and DirectX 3.0a (which was released in December 1996) are the last versions of Windows Media Player and DirectX available for Windows NT 4.0, respectively. The last versions of .NET Framework and Windows Installer available for Windows NT 4.0 are .NET Framework 1.1 (released in April 2003) and Windows Installer 2.0 (released in September 2001), respectively. The last version of Internet Explorer supported on Windows NT 4.0 is Internet Explorer 6 with SP1, which was released on September 9, 2002.

Windows NT 4.0 was succeeded by Windows 2000, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 5 by default. It also could be directly upgraded to Windows XP Professional on IA-32-based systems only.

An independent project named Windows Update Restored aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including Windows NT 4.0.

==Service packs==
Windows NT 4.0 received six service packs during its lifecycle, as well as numerous service rollup packages and option packs. Only the first service pack was made available for the MIPS architecture, Service Pack 2 was the final release for the PowerPC architecture, and Service Pack 6 was the final release for the Alpha architecture. Service Pack 6a (SP6a) is the last released service pack for Windows NT 4.0.

Service Pack 7 was planned at one stage in early 2001, but this became the &quot;Post SP6a Security Rollup&quot; and not a full service pack, released on July 26, 2001, 16 months following the release of Windows 2000 and nearly three months prior to the release of Windows XP.

In addition to bug fixes, the service packs also added a multitude of new features such as Ultra DMA mode for disk drives along with bus mastering, newer versions of Internet Information Services, user accounts and user profile improvements, smart card support, improved symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) scalability, clustering capabilities, MMX / 3DNow! / SSE / SSE2 support, AGP support, COM support improvements, Event Log service, MS-CHAPv2 and NTLMv2, SMB packet signing, Syskey, boot improvements, WINS improvements, Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), PPTP, DCOM/HTTP tunneling improvements, IGMPv2, WMI, Active Accessibility and NTFS 3.0 support among others.

==Resource Kits==
Microsoft released five revisions of the Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and Server Resource Kit (original release plus four supplements) which contained a large number of tools and utilities, such as desktops.exe which allowed the user to have multiple desktops, as well as third-party software.

==Security==
Microsoft stopped providing security updates for Windows NT 4.0 Workstation on June 30, 2004, Windows NT 4.0 Server on December 31, 2004, and Windows NT 4.0 Embedded on July 11, 2006, due to major security flaws including Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-010, which according to Microsoft could not be patched without significant changes to the core operating system. According to the security bulletin, &quot;Due to the fundamental differences between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 and its successors, it is infeasible to rebuild the software for Windows NT 4.0 to eliminate the vulnerability. To do so would require re-architecting a very significant amount of the Windows NT 4.0 operating system, and there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Windows NT 4.0 would continue to operate on the patched system.&quot;

Between June 2003 and June 2007, 127 security flaws were identified and patched in Windows 2000 Server, many of which may also affect Windows NT 4.0 Server; however, Microsoft does not test security bulletins against unsupported software.

<text>Chagatai Khan (; – 1242) was a son of Genghis Khan and a prominent figure in the early Mongol Empire. The second son of Genghis&#x27;s wife Börte, Chagatai was renowned for his masterful knowledge of Mongol custom and law, which he scrupulously obeyed, and his harsh temperament. Because Genghis felt that he was too inflexible in character, most notably never accepting the legitimacy of his elder brother Jochi, he excluded Chagatai from succession to the Mongol throne. He was nevertheless a key figure in ensuring the stability of the empire after Genghis&#x27;s death and during the reign of his younger brother Ögedei Khan.

Chagatai held military commands alongside his brothers during the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty in 1211 and the invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1219. During the latter, he was appointed to a key role in organising logistics in addition to battlefield responsibilities, but was censured after feuding with Jochi during the Siege of Gurganj. After the campaign, Chagatai was granted large tracts of conquered land in Central Asia, which he ruled until his death. He quarrelled with civil officials such as Mahmud Yalavach over matters of jurisdiction and advised Ögedei on questions of rulership. Chagatai died shortly after Ögedei in 1242; his descendants would rule his territories as the eponymous Chagatai Khanate.

== Biography ==
===Early life and personality===
Chagatai&#x27;s mother, Börte, was born into the Onggirat tribe, who lived along the Greater Khingan mountain range south of the Ergüne river, in modern-day Inner Mongolia. She married a Mongol leader named Temüjin after a seven-year betrothal. After giving birth to a daughter named Qojin, Börte was kidnapped and raped by members of the Merkit tribe—the true paternity of her next child, a son named Jochi, was never known, although Temüjin accepted his legitimacy. Chagatai, born in late 1183 or 1184, was thus the first son definitively fathered by Temüjin. He had six younger full siblings: two brothers named Ögedei and Tolui, and four sisters named Checheyigen, Alaqa, Tümelün, and Al Altan.

In 1206, having united the tribes of Mongolia, Temüjin held a large assembly called a where he was acclaimed as &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;. He began to reorder his new nation, dividing it between members of his ruling dynasty. Chagatai was granted territories near the Altai Mountains, where the Naiman tribe had previously ruled. He also received either 4,000 or 8,000 subjects, drawn from the Jalayir, Barlas, Suldus, Sonit, and Dughlat tribes. Chagatai&#x27;s two primary wives were the Onggirat women Yesülün and Tögen, the daughters of Börte&#x27;s cousin Qata; Yesülün was his favourite and the mother of his favourite son Mutukan. His other named sons were Mochi Yaba, the son of one of Yesülün&#x27;s servants and thus given little regard by his father, as well as Balgashi, Sarban, Yesu-Mongke, and Baidar, whose mothers are unknown.

Chagatai was renowned for his expertise in Mongol laws and traditional customs, especially when it came to following the will of the khan. According to some sources, Genghis entrusted him and his adopted brother Shigi Qutuqu with administering the legal code known as the &quot;Yasa&quot;. Medieval chroniclers such as Juzjani noted his strictness in interpreting the law and the harshness of his temperament.

===Military campaigns===
Alongside his brothers Jochi and Ögedei, Chagatai commanded the right wing in the 1211 invasion of the Chinese Jin dynasty. The Mongols marched southwards from Genghis&#x27;s campaign headquarters in modern Inner Mongolia in November 1211: first they attacked the cities in the area between Hohhot and Datong, and then they followed the Taihang Mountains into Shanxi, where they pillaged and plundered in autumn 1213, capturing the pastures of their enemies&#x27; cavalry reserves. During the 1219 invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire, Chagatai was charged with building bridges and maintaining roads to speed the Mongol advance and keep lines of communication open, in which capacity he was aided by his retainer Zhang Rong (1158–1230). 
He and Ögedei took charge of the siege of the city of Otrar, whose governor Inalchuq had provoked the invasion, while their father and brothers moved on. Its inhabitants fought fiercely for five months but were weakened by the defection of a leading general, who was executed by Ögedei and Chagatai because of his disloyalty. The city eventually fell in February 1220; Inalchuq held out for another month in the citadel before being captured himself. In revenge for Inalchuq&#x27;s actions, the Mongols either killed or enslaved Otrar&#x27;s entire population, while pillaging and destroying their town. Chagatai and Ögedei brought Inalchuq to their father at the siege of Samarkand, where he was publicly executed.

Chagatai and Ögedei were then sent to join Jochi at the Siege of Gurganj, the capital of the Khwarazmian Empire. The siege was lengthy, lasting between four and seven months, and exceptionally fierce: the defiant Khwarazmian defenders forced the Mongol army to engage in bitter house-by-house urban warfare, with much of the city destroyed either by burning naphtha or flooding from collapsed dams. After the city&#x27;s eventual fall in April 1221, its inhabitants were either killed or enslaved. The usual narrative of the siege recounts that Jochi and Chagatai quarrelled on how best to conduct its progress, as Jochi presumed that the rich city would become part of his domain and wished to damage it as little as possible. Chagatai on the other hand held no such qualms. When Genghis heard about this infighting, he ordered that Ögedei be promoted to command his brothers. The historian Christopher Atwood however argues that the narrative of fraternal conflicts was a later invention designed to buttress Ögedei&#x27;s right to rule the empire and that Jochi in reality retained primacy throughout the siege. 

Chagatai returned to his father&#x27;s side during the siege of Taliqan, which fell in summer 1221. Unknown to him, his favourite son Mutukan had died while besieging Bamiyan, whose population was massacred by the Mongols at the request of Mutukan&#x27;s widow. Genghis had been angered by Chagatai&#x27;s failure to capture Gurganj without significant Mongol casualties, and he decided to teach his son a lesson in self-control. He summoned Chagatai to his tent and accused him of not following orders; Chagatai replied that he would rather be executed than disobey. Genghis then revealed Mutukan&#x27;s death and ordered Chagatai not to grieve—the latter managed to control himself until he was able to weep in private. He was later present at the defeat of the Khwarazmian prince Jalal al-Din at the Battle of the Indus in November 1221, and commanded the rearguard during his father&#x27;s final campaign against the Western Xia state.

===Succession question===

The tribes of the Mongol steppe had no fixed succession system, and instead tended to elect a successor at a after the death of a ruler; importantly, the was not obliged to follow the wishes of the previous ruler. Although some Mongols argued that Chagatai&#x27;s traits would make him an excellent successor to his father, Genghis thought that he was too strict and narrow-minded, indicating a degree of inflexibility that did not suit a ruler. Genghis was also concerned about Chagatai&#x27;s intense dislike for Jochi, whom Chagatai regarded as illegitimate: at one family meeting, he reportedly called his brother a &quot;Merkit bastard&quot; and started brawling with him in front of their father. For these reasons, Genghis excluded Chagatai from succession to the throne. Jochi was also eliminated because of his rumoured illegitimacy, although Genghis himself did not care. Their younger brother Ögedei was eventually designated as heir.

After the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, Chagatai played a role in stabilising the empire before Ögedei&#x27;s accession in 1229. Tolui, who assumed the regency and who had also been a candidate for succession, considered attempting to gain power himself. Chagatai, who after Jochi&#x27;s death held the authority of Genghis&#x27;s eldest son, and many others remained unwaveringly faithful to Genghis&#x27;s will, and prevented any usurpation of power. Chagatai presided over the coronation ceremony alongside Tolui and their uncle Temüge and was a stalwart follower of Ögedei throughout his reign. In return, Ögedei often sought his elder brother&#x27;s advice and sent his eldest son Güyük to serve as one of Chagatai&#x27;s guards. Chagatai nevertheless chastised Ögedei for his excessive drinking and made him agree to limit the number of cups of alcohol he drank; Ögedei managed to get around this restriction by finding a very large cup.

===Ruler in Central Asia===

After the conclusion of the Khwarazmian campaign, Chagatai had been allocated a wide span of territories in Central Asia, stretching from the former Uighur territories near Almaliq, which became his capital and summer pastures, to the Amu Darya river in Transoxiana, which served as his winter pastures. These territories, roughly encompassing modern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, southern Kazakhstan, and parts of Xinjiang in China, had been ruled by the Qara Khitai state during the late 1100s, and contained a mixture of nomadic and sedentary populations. Chagatai and his descendants remained largely nomadic in the Mongol tradition and often disagreed with the governors of the settlements in Transoxiana, who were representatives not of the Chagatayids but of the ruler of the empire. 

Tension soon developed between one such official named Mahmud Yalavach and Chagatai. In 1238, the population of Bukhara, led by a sieve-maker, revolted against tax demands—the rebellion attracted wide support and succeeded in expelling the Mongol garrison. Chagatai did not help and left the revolt to Ögedei, whose armies quickly suppressed the uprising; the population faced total slaughter but was spared after Mahmud argued that only a part had been involved. It is likely that Chagatai exploited the situation to Mahmud&#x27;s detriment, although the precise details are unknown. 

Soon afterwards, Chagatai transferred the control of certain lands under Mahmud&#x27;s jurisdiction to one of his own followers. Mahmud complained to Ögedei, who ordered his brother to explain himself. Upon receiving an apology, Ögedei settled the tense situation to the satisfaction of all by sanctioning Chagatai&#x27;s initial transfer, moving Mahmud to an important post in north China, and promoting Mahmud&#x27;s son to govern in his place with the same powers as his father. Chagatai also squabbled with Körgüz, his brother&#x27;s governor in the region of Khorasan.

===Death and legacy===

After Ögedei&#x27;s death from alcoholism in December 1241, Chagatai was the &quot;de facto&quot; kingmaker. Ögedei&#x27;s favourite wife Möge initially assumed control but Töregene, the mother of his presumptive heir Güyük, sought to become regent; she crucially persuaded Chagatai that she was suitable, and with his support attained the position. Chagatai died in 1242; he was replaced as the senior Genghisid prince by Jochi&#x27;s son Batu. Yesülün accused one of Chagatai&#x27;s stewards, an Uighur from North China named Vajir, of poisoning him, and had him executed. Chagatai was succeeded in Central Asia by Qara Hülegü, the son of Mutukan, but he was usurped by his drunkard uncle Yesü-Möngke between 1246 and 1250, causing long-term weaknesses in the territories which became known as the Chagatai Khanate.

Although Chagatai&#x27;s loyalty to nomadic customs meant that he constructed no more than pools for waterfowl, storehouses, and small villages in his territories, he was a capable ruler who recruited both foreign educated experts and local Uighur officials to help administer his realm. Because Chagatai was a strict upholder of the traditional Mongol law, which forbade various elements of Islamic Sharia law, such as animal slaughter, ritual hygiene, or public prayer, he gained a reputation for being anti-Muslim. One contemporary Muslim writer claimed that he urged Ögedei to kill every Muslim in the empire. Modern historians such as Michael Hope and Peter Jackson suggest this is likely far from the truth: they point to a number of powerful Muslim officials and nobles at Chagatai&#x27;s court on whom he relied and whom he would have been unlikely to unnecessarily antagonise. More probable is the theory he forbade the practice of any non-Mongol legal system at his court. Nevertheless, his anti-Islamic and pro-&quot;Yasa&quot; reputation strongly influenced his descendants, who were far slower to convert to Islam than their counterparts in the other Mongol khanates, the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate.

<text>Wyrzysk () is a town in Poland with 5,263 (2004) inhabitants, situated in Piła County, Greater Poland Voivodeship.

== Geographic location ==
Wyrzysk is located in the ethnocultural region of Krajna in northern Greater Poland, administratively it is part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship.

== History ==
The Wyrzysk area was established first by East Germanic settlement at the beginning of the first millennium A.D. In the Middle Ages the Noteć became a natural border between the regions of Greater Poland and Pomerania, and the area became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century under the Piast dynasty. Later on, it long resisted the expansion of the German margraves, and since the 13th century also the Teutonic Knights. With time, local people adopted the Polish name Krajna for the area to the north of the Noteć. Eventually Polish ruler Bolesław III Wrymouth (1106–1138) conquered the castles on the Noteć and incorporated Krajna into the Kingdom of Poland for the next 700 years.

The first preserved mention of Wyrzysk dates back to 1326; the name of the place was then recorded in the so-called Greater Poland Codex. Wyrzysk was probably granted the royal charter before 1450; in 1565 it became a town under the so-called Magdeburg law. Administratively, it was located in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. As a result of series of wars in the second half of 17th century and beginning of 18th Wyrzysk became in fact a village. Wyrzysk was annexed by Prussia in 1772 in the First Partition of Poland. The town rights were renewed in 1773 by the Prussian King Frederick the Great who made the town a centre administering the construction of the Bydgoszcz Canal and the regulation of the Noteć. From 1807 to 1815 the town was a part of the Polish Duchy of Warsaw, established by Napoleon, and subsequently it was given back to Prussia as a result of Congress of Vienna. It remained Prussian until the end of First World War.

The Prussian monarch and his successors aimed at Germanisation of the annexed lands. The methods included the ban on Polish language, introduction of Prussian administration and German language and education, encouraging and supporting Prussian settlement while discouraging any further Polish settlement in the area, as well as purchasing estates from the Polish gentry. Wyrzysk and some surrounding areas was sold by Karol Rydzyński, Roch Sypniewski i Maria Samostrzelecki to King Frederick II The Great himself in 1773. In 1818 Wyrzysk became the seat of a county in the Grand Duchy of Posen, and from 1871 it was part of the German Empire. After years of Germanisation, when the area became increasingly populated by Germans, the Prussians abolished the law of corvée at the beginning of the 19th century. 
Polish resistance to Prussian rule accelerated the economic development and progress, especially in agriculture. Conflicts arose especially during the Kulturkampf period. The pressure of Germanisation and flood of German settlers encountered growing resistance from the discriminated Polish population of Krajna, who clung to their native language and the Roman Catholic religion. This found expression among decreasing Polish population in the establishment of patriotic Polish associations, choirs, sports clubs, banks and self-help organizations.
Wyrzysk was incorporated into a newly reborn Poland in 1919 by Treaty of Versailles, but merely 20 years later, with the beginning of World War II, the town was yet again occupied by Germany and annexed into the new Third Reich province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia as the seat of the county/district (&quot;kreis&quot;) of Wirsitz. In October and November 1939, as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, the German gendarmerie and &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; carried out mass arrests of local Poles, who then were imprisoned in the local court prison. Many Poles from Wyrzysk, including teachers and priests, were among hundreds of Poles massacred by the Germans in the nearby village of Paterek in October and November 1939. In 1940–1942, the occupiers also carried out expulsions of Poles, whose houses were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. A forced labor subcamp of the Stalag XX-A prisoner-of-war camp was operated by the Germans in the town. One of its prisoners was British actor Sam Kydd, who, as he wrote in his memoir, even learned various Polish phrases through contact with the local Polish population. In 1944, the Germans deported 300 Polish forced laborers aged 15–50 from the county to a forced labour camp in Jajkowo. The town was taken by the Red Army in January 1945 and returned to Poland after the war.

==Transport==
Wyrzysk used to be cut through by national road No. 10 leading from Szczecin to Warsaw but a bypass has now been built. This bypass connects Wyrzysk with Piła (37 km) and Bydgoszcz (55 km). The railway station in nearby Osiek nad Notecią also provides a railway connection with Piła (39 km) and Bydgoszcz (48 km).

==Sports==
The local football club is Łobzonka Wyrzysk. It competes in the lower leagues.

<text>Soviet submarine &quot;B-37&quot; () was a Project 641 or diesel submarine of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Northern Fleet.

==Service history==
On 11 January 1962, the submarine was tied up at the pier in Ekaterininsky Bay of Polarny naval base, with all watertight doors open, while conducting maintenance and testing of her torpedoes. A fire broke out in the torpedo compartment, probably due to hydrogen gas igniting when electrical equipment was energized. All eleven torpedoes cooked off. The submarine was instantly destroyed with all hands except the commanding officer Captain Second Rank Begeba who was on the pier at the time of explosion, and Captain Third Rank Jakubenko, who was on another part of the sub base.

, a Project 633 or submarine tied up next to &quot;B-37&quot;, was badly damaged by the explosion as well, and several men from other ships and the shipyard were killed.

In total, 122 people were killed: 59 &quot;B-37&quot; crewmen, 19 &quot;S-350&quot; crewmen, and 44 others. The explosion hurled &quot;B-37&quot;″s anchor nearly from the dock.

<text>Anthony Alexander Jarrett (born 13 August 1968 in Enfield, London) is a male former sprint and hurdling athlete from England. He has two children: Gabrielle and Noah. 

==Athletics career==
He was a silver medalist in the 110 metres hurdles at the World Championships in 1993 and 1995, and at the European Championships in 1990, and won the gold medal in the event at the Commonwealth Games in 1990 and 1998.

Jarrett came fourth in the 110m hurdles at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, missing out on a bronze medal by 1000th of a second to Jack Pierce of the United States. He again narrowly missed out on an Olympic medal when he was a member of the 4 × 100 m sprint relay team that also finished 4th in the Olympic final of that year. Four years earlier in 1988 he finished in 6th place in the 110m hurdles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

He represented England and won a gold medal as part of the 4 x 100 metres relay team and a silver medal in the 110 metres hurdles, at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. Four years later he represented England and won another silver medal, at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. He represented England for a third Games and won a gold medal, at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He also made a fourth appearance during the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games.

Jarrett&#x27;s career was overshadowed by the achievements of fellow Briton Colin Jackson, who beat him into second place on numerous occasions at major competitions such as the World Championships, Commonwealth Games (twice), European Championships and Goodwill Games. Jackson also defeated Jarrett eight times at the national championships. In all Jarrett won two individual world silver medals and one individual bronze medal in the 110m hurdles, and another silver and bronze medal in the 4 × 100 m sprint relay.

Jarrett was disqualified for false starts at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in the first round, and in the semi-finals of the 2001 World Championships, events from which he appeared never to recover.

Jarrett&#x27;s personal best time for the 110m hurdles is 13.00 seconds, set when he finished as runner-up to Jackson at the 1993 World Championships.

==Other Achievements==
*1987 European Athletics Junior Championships
**Gold medal
*1994 Goodwill Games
**Silver medal
*1994 IAAF World Cup
**Gold medal
*1999 European Cup
**Silver medal

===Track records===

As of 7 September 2024, Jarrett holds the following track records for 110 metres hurdles.

<text>Matochkin Strait or Matochkin Shar () is a strait, structurally a fjord, between the Severny and Yuzhny Islands of Novaya Zemlya. It connects the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea.

==Geography==
The Matochkin Strait is one of the largest fjords in the world.
The banks along the strait are high and steep. Its length is approximately and its width in its narrowest part is approximately
. The strait is covered with ice for most of the year. There are abandoned fishing settlements along the strait (Matochkin Shar, Stolbovoy).

==History==
The Tsar Bomba was detonated in October 1961, in the vicinity of Matochkin Strait, over the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.

It is also the site where, from 1963 to 1990, about 39 underground nuclear tests took place in a vast array of tunnels and shafts under Mount Lazarev and other massifs. After 2000, Russia started to reactivate the test site by enlarging old tunnels and starting construction work. Each summer since then various subcritical hydronuclear experiments have taken place. In 2004, Rosatom reportedly performed a series of subcritical hydronuclear experiments with up to of weapon-grade plutonium each.

<text>Kittens was a Canadian noise rock band from Winnipeg. The band was known for their intense live performances and country-influenced sound.

==History==
Shawn Fedorchuk, Russ Desjardine and Steve Kellas started Kittens together after they disbanded their previous band, Batsweat, recruiting drummer David Kelly and releasing the album Like A Plough on cassette. Desjardine (who went on to play bass in Artificial Joy and helped found The Bonaduces as drummer) and Steve then left the band and Jahmeel Russell joined on bass.

Kittens released several albums on Sonic Unyon in the late 1990s. Of all of their albums, the only ones to be released as a vinyl LP were 1997&#x27;s &quot;Bazooka and the Hustler&quot; and their split release with Shallow North Dakota. All other albums were released either on cassette or compact disc. The group disbanded in 1999. 

Kittens played two reunion shows in 2006 with KEN mode&#x27;s Jesse Matthewson replacing Russell on bass.
Russell is now a member of Red Vienna after stints in Projektor and Actors. David Kelly died in Los Angeles, CA in March 2008.

In 2014, Blunderspublik released a cover album, &quot;Kittens and Shit&quot;, commemorating Winnipeg&#x27;s 1990s bands, including Kittens.

<doc id="795780" wikidata="Q484318" url="?curid=795780" title="Ethos">
<text>Ethos ( or ) is a Greek word meaning &#x27;character&#x27; that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology; and the balance between caution and passion. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviors, and even morals. Early Greek stories of Orpheus exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word&#x27;s use in rhetoric is closely based on the Greek terminology used by Aristotle in his concept of the three artistic proofs or modes of persuasion alongside pathos and logos. It gives credit to the speaker, or the speaker is taking credit.

==Etymology and origin==
&quot;Ethos&quot; (, ; &quot;plurals:&quot; &quot;ethe&quot;, ; &quot;ethea&quot;, ) is a Greek word originally meaning &quot;accustomed place&quot; (as in &quot;the habitats of horses/&quot;, &quot;Iliad&quot; 6.511, 15.268), &quot;custom, habit&quot;, equivalent to Latin &quot;mores&quot;.

&quot;Ethos&quot; forms the root of &quot;ethikos&quot; (), meaning &quot;morality, showing moral character&quot;. As an adjective in the neuter plural form &quot;ta ethika.&quot;

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values peculiar to a specific person, people, organization, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic T. S. Eliot wrote in 1940 that &quot;the general ethos of the people they have to govern determines the behavior of politicians&quot;. Similarly the historian Orlando Figes wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s &quot;the ethos of the Communist party dominated every aspect of public life&quot;.
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Arie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into Palestine in the 1930s brought about &quot;the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development&quot;.

==Rhetoric==

In rhetoric, ethos (credibility of the speaker) is one of the three artistic proofs (&quot;pistis&quot;, πίστις) or modes of persuasion (other principles being &quot;logos&quot; and &quot;pathos&quot;) discussed by Aristotle in &#x27;Rhetoric&#x27; as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start. This can involve &quot;moral competence&quot; only; Aristotle, however, broadens the concept to include expertise and knowledge. For the most part, this perspective of ethos is the one discussed the most by schools and universities. Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others, however, contend that a speaker&#x27;s ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf Isocrates).

According to Aristotle, there are three categories of ethos:

* &quot;phronesis&quot; – useful skills and practical wisdom
* &quot;arete&quot; – virtue, goodwill
* &quot;eunoia&quot; – goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience and it&#x27;s appealing to the audience&#x27;s emotions. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy (Appeal to motive). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===
Although Plato never uses the term &quot;ethos&quot; in his extant corpus; scholar Collin Bjork, a communicator, podcaster, and digital rhetorician, argues that Plato dramatizes the complexity of rhetorical ethos in the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;. For Aristotle, a speaker&#x27;s ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to &quot;inspire trust in his audience&quot; (&quot;Rhetorica&quot; 1380). &quot;Ethos&quot; was therefore achieved through the orator&#x27;s &quot;good sense, good moral character, and goodwill&quot;, and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this &quot;good moral character&quot; was increased in virtuous degree by habit (&quot;Rhetorica&quot; 1380). Ethos also is related to a character&#x27;s habit as well (The Essential Guide to Rhetoric, 2018). The person&#x27;s character is related to a person&#x27;s habits (The Essential Guide to Rhetoric, 2018). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and &quot;ethos&quot; most succinctly in Book II of &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;: &quot;Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name &quot;ethike&quot; is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word &quot;ethos&quot; (habit)&quot; (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: &quot;Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety&quot; (13). Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counter publics. While Warner contends that members of counter publics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas&#x27;s conception of the public sphere as a dominant &quot;social totality&quot; by theorizing &quot;subaltern counter publics&quot;, which function as alternative publics that represent &quot;parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs&quot; (67).

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer ways of conceiving of ethos that are influenced by postmodern concepts of identity, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women&#x27;s use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, &quot;Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker&#x27;s identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak&quot; (83). Rhetorical scholar and Kate Ronald&#x27;s claim that &quot;ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker&#x27;s private and public self&quot;, (39) also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links credibility and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that &quot;these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher&#x27;s sense. Rather they are &#x27;deceptions&#x27; in the sophistic sense: recognition of the ways one is positioned multiply differently&quot; (56).

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos &quot;emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private&quot; (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of &quot;ethos&quot;, Halloran illuminates the interdependence between &quot;ethos&quot; and cultural context by arguing that &quot;To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks&quot; (60). While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre&#x27;s argument in &quot;Invention as Social Act&quot; situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos &quot;appears in that socially created space, in the &#x27;between&#x27;, the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader&quot; (45–46).

According to Nedra Reynolds, &quot;ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces&quot; (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim &quot;that ethos can be faked or &#x27;manipulated&#x27;&quot; because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one&#x27;s ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure&#x27;s &quot;ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices&quot; (48).

In &quot;Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos&quot;, scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, &quot;Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans&#x27; ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture&quot; (43).

==In Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in Greek tragedy. Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple. Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays. This limited the scope of the play and characterization so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon at the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting. One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character. One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-cast, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint. Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse. Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterization is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterized by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.

Garet makes three more observations about a character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer&#x27;s need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterization. For example, the play Julius Caesar, is a good example for a character without credibility, Brutus. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components&#x27; effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character&#x27;s impact on action.

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle&#x27;s statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but the character cannot exist without plot, and so the character is secondary to the plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle&#x27;s statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters. However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that &quot;[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot&quot;.

One other term frequently used to describe the dramatic revelation of character in writing is &quot;persona&quot;. While the concept of &quot;ethos&quot; has traveled through the rhetorical tradition, the concept of &quot;persona&quot; has emerged from the literary tradition, and is associated with a theatrical mask. Roger Cherry explores the distinctions between &quot;ethos&quot; and &quot;pathos&quot; to mark the distance between a writer&#x27;s autobiographical self and the author&#x27;s discursive self as projected through the narrator. The two terms also help to refine distinctions between situated and invented ethos. &quot;Situated ethos&quot; relies on a speaker&#x27;s or writer&#x27;s durable position of authority in the world; &quot;invented ethos&quot; relies more on the immediate circumstances of the rhetorical situation.

==In pictorial narrative==
Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject&#x27;s ethical character and through this the work&#x27;s overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can. This characterization portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle&#x27;s idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O&#x27;Donnell, p. 178) Mark D. Stansbury-O&#x27;Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character&#x27;s moral choices. (Stansbury-O&#x27;Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action. However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle&#x27;s opinion that &quot;his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public&quot;. Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, &quot;[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the polis&quot;. Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character&#x27;s choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O&#x27;Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene (Stansbury-O&#x27;Donnell, p. 177). Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks&#x27; conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, &quot;ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality&quot;.

<text>Liberia () is a district and the largest city in the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica, located northwest of the national capital, San José. Part of the Liberia canton, it is a major center for the country&#x27;s tourism industry.

Liberia has been nicknamed &quot;la ciudad blanca&quot; (the white city) due to the white gravel that was once used to make the city&#x27;s roads and the whitewashed colonial houses which used to make up a large part of the city. It had a population of 56,899 in 2013.

==History==
Modern-day Liberia was founded as a hermitage without any legal or formal act of foundation on 4 September 1769. It was located in a strategic location where the roads from the towns of Rivas, Bagaces, and Nicoya met. The hermitage was used primarily as a place of rest by travelers. The area&#x27;s giant guanacaste trees provided shade for travelers and livestock, and over time the area became known as Guanacaste (El Poblado de Guanacaste).

The settlement itself shares a history with Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In 1812 the Cortes of Cádiz created a single autonomous province, covering Nicaragua and Costa Rica, with its capital in León. Nicaragua and Costa Rica achieved independence from Spain on 15 September 1821 after the Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence. After the short-lived First Mexican Empire (1821–1823), Costa Rica (considered a minor provincial outpost at the time) became part of the newly formed Federal Republic of Central America in 1823. The Partido de Nicoya (Nicoya&#x27;s Party) served as an administrative unit for the Federal Republic of Central America. The Partido de Nicoya comprised much of the territory that today is the province of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Most of the area, such as the settlements of Nicoya and Santa Cruz, held economic ties to Costa Rican territory such as the growing port of Puntarenas. The settlement of Guanacaste (modern day Liberia), on the other hand, held closer economic ties to Nicaraguan territory like the town of Rivas.

Under the leadership of the villages of Nicoya and Santa Cruz, the Partido de Nicoya voted to annex themselves to Costa Rica on 25 July 1824.

The inhabitants of Guanacaste (modern day Liberia) chose to continue to be part of Nicaragua in 1824. In 1826, after years of dispute, the congress of the Federal Republic of Central America added Guanacaste (modern day Liberia) to Costa Rica.

The village of Guanacaste grew in importance and gradually overtook the village of Nicoya as the most important settlement in the area.
On 23 July 1831, the settlement of Guanacaste was given the title of Villa de Guanacaste. Just a few years later on 3 September 1836 it was given the name Ciudad de Guanacaste (City of Guanacaste).

In 1838 after the Federal Republic of Central America began to dissolve, Costa Rica formally withdrew and proclaimed itself a sovereign state. On 7 December 1848 Costa Rica divided its national territory into provinces, cantons, and districts. The territory encompassing Nicoya, Bagaces, Santa Cruz, Guanacaste (modern day Liberia) and Cañas became part of the newly formed province of Guanacaste.

On 30 May 1854, a government decree changed the name of the City of Guanacaste (Ciudad de Guanacaste) to the City of Liberia (Ciudad de Liberia). The name of the province of Guanacaste was changed to Moracia in honor of then Costa Rican president Juan Rafael Mora Porras.

In August 1859, Juan Rafael Mora Porras was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état orchestrated by Dr. Jose Maria Montealegre. On 20 June 1860 during the administration of new Costa Rican president Dr. Jose Maria Montealegre, the name of the province was switched back from Moracia to Guanacaste. Montealegre kept the name City of Liberia but saw it unfit to keep a province named after a political enemy.

Today, the Annexation of Guanacaste is celebrated annually on 25 July to celebrate the date in which the province became a part of Costa Rica instead of Nicaragua. Liberia holds a large festival as the capital of Guanacaste where one can find folk dances, parades, cattle shows, local food, and other cultural traditions in the area. Music is a large part of the festival and the traditional &quot;marimba&quot; is very popularly heard. A parade also takes place in the centre of the city at which children wear masks and costumes.

Liberia&#x27;s importance continued to grow and it became a major center for agriculture and livestock. The construction of the Pan-American Highway further increased Liberia&#x27;s importance and increased commerce in and out of the city. By the late 20th century, Liberia had become a major stopping point for tourists traveling to the Pacific Coast beaches of Guanacaste.

Today Liberia and the province of Guanacaste accept 25 July 1824 as their annexation day to Costa Rica.

== Geography ==
Liberia has an area of km2 and an elevation of metres.

== Demographics ==

For the 2011 census, Liberia had a population of inhabitants.

==Summary==
With more than 50,000 inhabitants, Liberia is the regional hub of the Costa Rican northwest. The city center features a modern church, as many Costa Rican towns do, facing a plaza surrounded by locally owned shops and restaurants. Liberia is also home to an expo that takes place in the month of July, celebrating the annexation of Guanacaste Province on 25 July 1824.

Located in the heart of Liberia, Guanacaste, the Museo de Guanacaste represents the civility of Costa Rica, and the embodiment of military abolishment. The Museo de Guanacaste portrays many of the local and national artists. Volunteers come from both internationally and locally to help restore the location and also preserve the cultural heritage.

Tourists pass through Liberia en route to Pacific Coast beaches such as Playa del Coco, Playa Hermosa, Playa Tamarindo or the Papagayo Peninsula. An African safari attraction or zoo called &quot;Africa Mia&quot; is 4 kilometers south of town. The Museo de Sabanero is also located in Liberia.

Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park is located just to the northeast of Liberia. Volcanic hot springs, bubbling clay pots, and numerous waterfalls and rivers may be found along the park&#x27;s many kilometres of hiking trails. Hot springs are also located to the southeast of Liberia along the west slopes of Miravalles volcano.

==Transportation==
=== Road transportation ===
The district is covered by the following road routes:
* National Route 1
* National Route 21
* National Route 918

=== Airport===
The Daniel Oduber Quirós International Airport is 13 kilometres (8 miles) west of the city, following the road to Nicoya. This is the second international airport in the country, after the Juan Santamaría International Airport in San José, and serves a variety of cities in the United States and Canada, as well as London and Amsterdam.

Liberia Airport is very close to the most beautiful beaches from Guanacaste province, such as Tamarindo, Nosara, Sámara, Carrillo, Playa del Coco, Montezuma, Malpaís, and Santa Teresa.

The Liberia River bears the same name as the town.

==Sports==
Municipal Liberia is the city&#x27;s major football team, having spent almost 10 years in the Costa Rican Primera División after winning promotion in 2001. They play their home games in the Estadio Edgardo Baltodano Briceño.

== Climate ==
This area typically has a pronounced dry season. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Liberia has a tropical savanna climate, abbreviated &quot;Aw&quot; on climate maps.
In Liberia, as in the rest of Costa Rica outside the perennially humid Caribbean coast, there are essentially two seasons – the &quot;dry&quot; and the &quot;wet.&quot; The dry season runs from November to April, when the temperature is high and very little rainfall, if any, is experienced. The wet season runs from May to October when it often rains throughout the entire country. However, Liberia is considered to be one of the drier cities in the province of Guanacaste, which experiences much less rain than the rest of country. Even in wet seasons, Liberia is quite dry in comparison to the rest of Costa Rica.

If weather is a concern as a traveler, the best time to visit this city would be towards the start of the dry season where the climate is only beginning to get warm, and precipitation from the wet season has decreased. The dry season can get quite hot and sometimes becomes uncomfortable for those who are not accustomed to such dry heat.

<text>William Henry Dallinger FRS (5 July 1839 – 7 November 1909) was a British minister in the Wesleyan Methodist Church. He was also an accomplished scientist, being the first to study the complete lifecycle of unicellular organisms under the microscope and studying the adaptation of such organisms to temperature.

He made numerous contributions to microscopy, and was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1889 to 1892. Dallinger was awarded three honorary doctorates, the Ll.D. from Victoria College, Toronto in 1884, the D.Sc. from Dublin in 1892, and the D.L.C. from Durham in 1896.

Dallinger was married to Emma Ion Goldsmith (1842-1910). They had one child, son Percy Gough (1867-1930).

== Research into Darwin&#x27;s theories ==

Dallinger was one of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment. In the late 19th century, he cultivated small unicellular organisms in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years (1880–1886). Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60 °F up to 158 °F. The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73 °F, and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158 °F. The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment, on the other hand, were perfectly fine at 158 °F. However, these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60 °F. Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator, and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment. Unfortunately, Dallinger&#x27;s incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886, and Dallinger could not continue this line of research.

Dallinger was an early supporter of Darwinism. He accepted natural selection and considered creationism to be &quot;absolutely untenable&quot;. He believed there was no conflict between religion and science and there was no reason to try and reconcile the Book of Genesis with geology.

<text>Guy of Warwick, or Gui de Warewic, is a legendary English hero of Romance popular in England and France from the 13th to 17th centuries, but now largely forgotten. The story of Sir Guy is considered by scholars to be part of the Matter of England.

==Plot==
The core of the legend is that Guy falls in love with the lady Felice (&quot;Happiness&quot;), who is of much higher social standing. In order to wed Felice he must prove his valour in chivalric adventures and become a knight; in order to do this he travels widely, battling fantastic monsters such as dragons, giants, a Dun Cow (sometimes known as &quot;tifmo&quot;) and great boars. He returns and weds Felice but soon, full of remorse for his violent past, he leaves on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; later he returns privately and lives out his long life as a hermit (according to local legend in a cave overlooking the River Avon, situated at Guy’s Cliffe).

In one recension, Guy, son of Siward or Seguard of Wallingford, by his prowess in foreign wars wins in marriage Felice (the Phyllis of the well-known ballad), daughter and heiress of Roalt, Earl of Warwick. Soon after his marriage he is seized with remorse for the violence of his past life, and, by way of penance, leaves his wife and fortune to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. After years of absence he returns in time to deliver Winchester for King Æthelstan from the invading northern kings, Anelaph (Anlaf or Olaf) and Gonelaph, by slaying in single combat their champion, the giant Colbrand. Winchester tradition fixes the duel at Hyde Mead, before the Abbey near Winchester. Making his way to Warwick, he becomes one of his wife&#x27;s beadsmen, and presently retires to a hermitage in Arden, only revealing his identity, like Saint Roch, at the approach of death.

==Historiography==

In the Middle Ages the story in the chronicle of Pierre de Langtoft (Peter of Langtoft) written at the end of the thirteenth century was accepted as authentic fact. It was still taken seriously enough in the late 16th century for it to be at the heart of a prolonged dispute between the noble families of Dudley and Arden. It was also well known to William Shakespeare, who mentioned the giant Colbrand in his plays King John and Henry VIII.
The Anglo-Norman warrior hero of &quot;Gui de Warewic&quot;, marked Guy&#x27;s first appearance in the early thirteenth century. Topographical allusions show the poem&#x27;s composer to be more familiar with the area of Wallingford, near Oxford, than with Warwickshire.

Guy was transformed in the fourteenth century with a spate of metrical romances written in Middle English. The versions which we possess are adaptations from the French, and are cast in the form of a &quot;roman&quot;; the adventures open with a long recital of Guy&#x27;s wars in Lombardy, Germany and Constantinople, embellished with fights with dragons and surprising feats of arms. The name &quot;Guy&quot; entered the Beauchamp family, earls of Warwick, when William de Beauchamp IV inherited the title in 1269 through his mother&#x27;s brother, and named his heir &quot;Guy&quot; in 1298. A tower added to Warwick Castle in 1394 was named &quot;Guy&#x27;s Tower&quot;, and Guy of Warwick relics began to accumulate, including the reputed Guy of Warwick&#x27;s Sword, Sir Guy&#x27;s fork (believed to be a historic military fork), and large cauldron known as Sir Guy&#x27;s &quot;Porridge Pot&quot; (believed to be a large garrison crock of the sixteenth century). Queen Elizabeth I is alleged to have paid for these relics to be guarded.

&quot;Filicia&quot;, who belongs to the twelfth century, was perhaps the Norman poet&#x27;s patroness, and occurs in the pedigree of the Ardens, descended from Thurkill of Warwick and his son Siward. Guy’s Cliffe, near Warwick, where in the fourteenth century Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, erected a chantry, with a statue of the hero, does not correspond with the site of the hermitage as described in the &quot;Godfreyson&quot; (see Havelok).

The adventures of Reynbrun, son of Guy, and his tutor, Heraud of Arden, who had also educated Guy, have much in common with his father&#x27;s history, and form an interpolation sometimes treated as a separate romance. A connection between Guy and Guido, count of Tours (flourished about 800) was made when Alcuin&#x27;s advice to the count, &quot;Liber ad Guidonem&quot;, was transferred to the English hero in the &quot;Speculum Gy de Warewyke&quot; (c. 1327), edited for the Early English Text Society by Georgiana Lea Morrill Morrill in 1898.

=== Possible origins ===
The name &quot;Guy&quot; (from Guido or Wido) was brought to Britain by the Normans, suggesting that if the story really already existed, that the name was adapted from a similar-sounding Anglo-Saxon name. A cupbearer to Edward the Confessor, Wigod of Wallingford, who was also later favoured by William the Conqueror, and whose daughter and granddaughter held the lordship of Wallingford up to the time of Henry II, is one such candidate. Another possible historical inspiration of the romance is an historical Siward, who was sheriff of Warwickshire shortly before the Norman Conquest, and had, according to documents quoted by Dugdale, a daughter of the unusual name of &quot;Felicia&quot;.

Velma Bourgeois Richmond has traced the career of the character known as &quot;Guy of Warwick&quot; from the legends of soldier saints to metrical romances composed for an aristocratic audience, which widened in the sixteenth century to a popular audience that included Guy among the Nine Worthies, passing into children&#x27;s literature and local guidebooks, before dying out in the twentieth century. The kernel of the tradition evidently lies in Guy&#x27;s fight with the giant Colbrand. The religious side of the legend finds parallels in the stories of St Eustachius and St Alexius, and makes it probable that the Guy-legend, as we have it, has passed through monastic hands. Tradition seems to be at fault in putting Guy&#x27;s adventures anachronistically in the reign of Æthelstan; the Anlaf of the story is probably Olaf Tryggvason, who, with Sweyn I of Denmark, harried the southern counties of England in 993 and pitched his winter quarters in Southampton; this means the King of England at the time was Æthelred the Unready.Winchester was saved, however, not by the valour of an English champion, but by the payment of money. This Olaf was not unnaturally confused with Anlaf Cuaran or Havelok the Dane.

==Manuscript tradition==

The Anglo-Norman French romance was edited by Alfred Ewert in 1932 and published by Champion, and is described by Emile Littré in &quot;Histoire littéraire de la France&quot; (xxii., 841–851, 1852). A French prose version was printed in Paris, 1525, and subsequently (see Gustave Brunet, &quot;Manuel du libraire&quot;, &quot;s.v.&quot; &quot;Guy de Warvich&quot;); the English metrical romance exists in four versions dating from the early fourteenth century; the text was edited by J. Zupitza (1875–1876) for the Early English Text Society from Cambridge University Library, Paper MS. Ff. 2, 38, and again (pts. 1883–1891, extra series, Nos. 42, 49, 59), from the Auchinleck manuscript and Caius College MS. A late mediaeval Irish prose version, copied in the 15th century, &quot;The Irish Lives of Guy of Warwick and Bevis of Hampton&quot; is in Trinity College Library, Dublin (Ms H.2.7), and is largely based on the English originals (this, and its translation by F. N. Robinson, are available online from the CELT project).

The popularity of the legend is shown by the numerous versions in English: John Lydgate claimed that &quot;Guy of Warwick&quot;, his English verse version composed between 1442 and 1468, was translated from the Latin chronicle of Giraldus Cornubiensis (fl. 1350); &quot;Guy of Warwick, a poem&quot; (written in 1617 and licensed, but not printed) by John Lane, the manuscript of which (in the British Library) contains a sonnet by John Milton, father of the poet; &quot;The Famous Historie of Guy, Earl of Warwick&quot; (c. 1607) by Samuel Rowlands; &quot;The Booke of the moste Victoryous Prince Guy of Warwicke&quot; (William Copland, London, n.d.); other editions by J. Cawood and C. Bates; chapbooks and ballads of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; &quot;The Tragical History, Admirable Achievements and Various Events of Guy Earl of Warwick&quot; (1661) which may possibly be identical with a play on the subject written by John Day and Thomas Dekker, and entered at Stationers&#x27; Hall on 15 January 1618/19; three verse fragments are printed by Hales and F. J. Furnivall in their edition of the Percy Folio MS. vol. ii.; an early French MS. is described by J. A. Herbert (&quot;An Early MS. of Gui de Warwick&quot;, London, 1905). In the chivalric romance &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot;, written by the Valencian knight Joanot Martorell, there appears a character based on Guy whose name is Guillem de Varoic.

== Depictions in culture ==
Guy of Warwick, along with Colbrand the Giant, is mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (Porter&#x27;s Man: &quot;I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand, To mow &#x27;em down before me.&quot; (5.3)) Colbrand is also mentioned in &quot;King John&quot;. (Bastard: &quot;Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?&quot; (1.1))

A stage act drawing on the myth called &quot;Sir Guy of Warwick&quot; tours Renaissance festivals in the United States.

<doc id="795855" wikidata="Q1117010" url="?curid=795855" title="Liberal Party (Australia, 1909)">
<text>The Liberal Party was a parliamentary party in Australian federal politics between 1909 and 1917. The party was founded under Alfred Deakin&#x27;s leadership as a merger of the Protectionist Party and Anti-Socialist Party, an event known as the Fusion.

The creation of the party marked the emergence of a two-party system, replacing the unstable multi-party system that arose after Federation in 1901. The first three federal elections produced hung parliaments, with the Protectionists, Free Traders, and Australian Labor Party (ALP) forming a series of minority governments. Free Trade leader George Reid envisioned an anti-socialist alliance of liberals and conservatives, rebranding his party accordingly, and his views were eventually adopted by his Protectionist counterpart Deakin. Objections towards Reid saw Deakin take the lead in coordinating the merger. The Fusion was controversial, with some of Deakin&#x27;s radical supporters regarding it as a betrayal and choosing to sit as independents or join the ALP.

The new party formed Australia&#x27;s first federal majority government and allowed Deakin to return for a third term as prime minister. However, it lost the 1910 election to the ALP in a landslide and had little electoral success thereafter, winning a majority in the House of Representatives only once and never in the Senate. Following the ALP split over conscription in 1916, Deakin&#x27;s successor Joseph Cook led the Liberals into an alliance with Prime Minister Billy Hughes&#x27; new National Labor Party. The two parties formally merged under Hughes&#x27; leadership a few months before the 1917 federal election, with the resulting Nationalist Party becoming the new primary opponent of the ALP in the two-party system.

Unlike the ALP, the Liberal Party did not have a single external organisation supporting the parliamentary party and had only loose links with equivalent parties at state level. Deakin attempted to form a national organisation under the name &quot;Commonwealth Liberal Party&quot;, but it failed to spread beyond Victoria. In each state various similar bodies were created to endorse candidates and provide campaign financing, while the party also enjoyed the support of pre-existing organisations like the Australian Women&#x27;s National League. The &quot;Liberal&quot; identity was retained by some state parties after 1917 and revived by Nationalist breakaways in the 1920s, eventually being re-adopted by the modern Liberal Party of Australia.

==History==
===Background===
George Reid adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.

===Foundation===
The Liberal Party was founded between three conferences on 25–27 May 1909. The party was a merger, or &quot;Fusion&quot;, of the Protectionist Party and Anti-Socialist Party. These parties, although sharing different ideologies and policies, merged to form a single non-Labor opposition. The party merger was voted with few in attendance being opposed to it. The most prominent being William Lyne. Alfred Deakin was voted leader unanimously.
The Liberal Party was formed in response to Labor forming its second government under Andrew Fisher in 1908. Under considerable pressure from middle- and upper-class interests, Alfred Deakin, the leader of the Protectionists, and Joseph Cook, leader of the Anti-Socialists, joined forces in order to counter Labor&#x27;s growing popularity. In 1909, the two parties at a meeting in Melbourne&#x27;s Parliament House agreed to merge into a single party, based on a shared anti-Labor platform. Deakin was the new party&#x27;s first leader, with Cook as deputy leader. The merger didn&#x27;t sit well with several of the more liberal Protectionists, who defected to Labor or sat as independents.

Between them, the Protectionists and Anti-Socialists held a majority of seats on the floor of the House of Representatives. As a result, the newly merged party used its numbers to force Fisher to hand power to Deakin. However, the Liberals were defeated by Labor at the 1910 election, which saw Labor with an elected majority in both houses, the first federal occurrence for a party.

Cook took over the leadership from Deakin shortly before the 1913 election and won government by a single seat. However, only a year later, Cook deliberately introduced a bill abolishing preferential treatment for public-service union members. Cook knew the Labor-controlled Senate would vote the bill down, giving him an excuse to call a double dissolution election, the first time one would be called. When the Senate rejected the bill twice, Cook called the 1914 election. The Liberal Party was again defeated with Labor again winning a majority in both houses.

The Liberals remained in opposition until November 1916, when it reached a confidence and supply agreement with Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who had recently been expelled from Labor for supporting conscription in World War I and organised his followers as the National Labor Party. In February 1917, the Liberals and National Labor formally merged to form the Nationalist Party. Although the merged party was dominated by former Liberals, Hughes became its leader with Cook as his deputy. Hughes would stay on as prime minister until the 1922 election where the new Country Party of Australia (later The Nationals) stripped the Nationalists of their majority, and demanded his resignation in exchange for confidence and supply. Stanley Bruce subsequently became prime minister.

The Liberal Party of 1909 is often referred to by the retronym &quot;Deakinite Liberal Party&quot; in order to distinguish it from the later Liberal Party of Australia, which was officially founded in 1945. According to David Kemp, &quot;the common reference to the Federal Liberal Party as the &#x27;Commonwealth Liberal Party&#x27; is not correct, as this name was given only to Deakin&#x27;s state party&quot;.

===Australian Liberal Union===
The Australian Liberal Union was established in November 1911, following a conference in Melbourne attended by representatives of liberal organisations in each state. The conference resolved that the state-based organisations should co-operate more closely during federal election campaigns. The council of the new body was to consist of three representatives from each state.

A second interstate conference was held in Melbourne in May 1912, with Senator Joseph Vardon presiding. A constitution for the Australian Liberal Union was adopted, where it was agreed that the organisation would be governed by an annual conference. The constitution provided that the union would regularly confer with the federal parliamentary party, and that its work would be confined to federal politics. The state organisations would remain in charge of state politics, but would select federal candidates. The conference also debated a fighting platform for the next federal election, which was not issued until 13 June. It comprised 20 planks.

A third conference was held in Melbourne in August 1913, postponed and moved from Sydney due to a smallpox outbreak. The inaugural address at the conference was given by the incumbent prime minister and parliamentary Liberal leader Joseph Cook. David Gordon was elected president of the organisation. An updated platform was issued in October. Another meeting was held in March 1914, and in October 1915 Joseph Cook stated that a meeting of the executive was planned to be held.

===State bodies===

====Victoria====
In Victoria, Deakin formed an organisation to support the parliamentary Liberals under the name Commonwealth Liberal Party (CLP). It was formed at a meeting in Melbourne on 5 April 1909, with the aim &quot;to organise the Liberal voters, both men and women, throughout Australia&quot;. It was officially launched by Deakin with himself as president on 25 May 1909 at the Melbourne Town Hall.

According to Deakin&#x27;s biographer Judith Brett, the CLP did not spread beyond Victoria and &quot;in fact scarcely beyond Deakin and his family, who provided most of its office bearers&quot;. His son-in-law Herbert Brookes was Deakin&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot;, serving as party treasurer and chief fundraiser, while Deakin&#x27;s daughter Ivy Brookes was founder and secretary of the CLP women&#x27;s section, intended to form a liberal counterpart to the more conservative Australian Women&#x27;s National League. In 1911, the CLP renamed itself the People&#x27;s Liberal Party, as part of an abortive merger with the People&#x27;s Party, a rural liberal organisation. In July 1911, the PLP launched a monthly magazine, the &quot;Liberal&quot;, which was financed and edited by Herbert Brookes. Deakin wrote anonymous articles for the publication, which was short-lived.

====New South Wales====
The New South Wales Federal Liberal League was established in July 1909 to help elect Liberal candidates to federal parliament. It was established by delegates from the Liberal and Reform Association, the People&#x27;s Reform League, the Liberal and Progressive League, and the three equivalent women&#x27;s branches. Dugald Thomson was chosen as the organisation&#x27;s president and Archdale Parkhill as its secretary. Joseph Cook was given the title of &quot;leader&quot;. The league began conducting preselection ballots and endorsing candidates for federal parliament later in the year.

====Other states====

Organisations supporting the federal parliamentary Liberals in other states included the People&#x27;s Progressive League in Queensland, the Liberal Union in South Australia (1910), the Tasmanian Liberal League, and the Liberal League of Western Australia.

<doc id="795860" wikidata="Q14346467" url="?curid=795860" title="Yellow socialism">
<text>Yellow socialism, or yellow unionism, was an economic system proposed in 1902 in France by Pierre Biétry, as an alternative to the &quot;red socialism&quot; advocated in Marxism. Biétry envisioned workers organizing unions which would operate in parallel with groups of businesses (a structure similar to corporatism). Workers would get a greater share of company profits through negotiation between each union and the corresponding business group. Above this would be a strong authoritarian State.

Yellow socialism was prominent in France until World War I, competing with Marxism for support among workers. The name &quot;yellow socialism&quot; was also a Marxist term of abuse for all non-Marxist socialists. After World War I, the term &quot;yellow socialism&quot; fell into disuse.

==History==

Pierre Biétry had been a member of the Marxist French Workers&#x27; Party until his departure in 1900. Disappointed by the failure of &quot;Red socialism&quot; to improve the condition of the workers, he now advocated cooperation between organized labor and capitalist businesses. He called this &quot;Yellow socialism&quot;, as a deliberate contrast to Marxist &quot;Red socialism&quot;. In 1902, he founded the Fédération nationale des Jaunes de France (&quot;National Federation of Yellows of France&quot; - FNJF). Later, affiliated Swiss and German &quot;Yellow&quot; groups formed. All the &quot;Yellow&quot; groups were strongly opposed to Marxism.

The FNJF gained some support among more conservative workers when strikes by unions of the &quot;Red&quot; Confédération générale du travail (CGT) included violence.

In the next few years, Biétry added antisemitism to the FNJF program, and the FNJF became entangled with the reactionary French right wing. Some of its members and organizers joined &quot;Action Française&quot;; other returned to the CGT. The FNJF held its last congress in 1909. Biétry went to Indochina and died there in 1918.

The &quot;Yellow socialist&quot; label was appropriated by Marxist Reds to describe any socialist whom the Reds considered as on the side of the ruling class: that is, all non-Marxist socialists, whether they used the &quot;Yellow&quot; label or not. The Red usage thus included many whose ideas would later be known as social democracy and democratic socialism, concepts very different from those of Biétry.

In the United States, &quot;Yellow socialism&quot; was associated with the business unionism of Samuel Gompers (and thus described as &quot;Yellow unionism&quot;). Business unionism was based on the belief that the workers&#x27; best option was to form a labor cartel within a capitalist society.

Marxists criticized &quot;Yellow&quot; socialists and unionists for nationalism, and also for perceived occasional engagement in ethnic and racial chauvinism. This was seen in &quot;Yellow&quot; opposition to immigration, because competition from immigrants reduced wages or took jobs from native-born workers, and sometimes even racism including antisemitism.

In Europe, during World War I, Marxists associated the social democratic parties with &quot;Yellow socialism&quot;, as they supported their own nations in the war rather than taking an internationalist position against the conflict. However, these parties had no connection to Biétry&#x27;s thinking.

The Berne International, formed with the Zimmerwald conference in 1915, was similarly described as &quot;Yellow socialist&quot; by Vladimir Lenin for its rejection of revolutionary socialism, despite its opposition to the war.

<text>Dub Narcotic Sound System (D.N.S.S.) is an Olympia, Washington based indie-funk musical group founded by Calvin Johnson, signed to K Records.

==Origins==
The band was named after Calvin Johnson&#x27;s basement recording studio, Dub Narcotic. The band and its members were all based in Olympia, Washington when they were active in the band. Dub Narcotic Sound System has toured in the United States, Japan, Canada and Europe with bands such as Built to Spill, Fugazi, and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.

== Critical reception ==
The Register-Guard described the band in 1999 as an &quot;electronica and hip-hop tinged indie combo&quot;. The newspaper also criticised Johnson&#x27;s vocals, citing them as &quot;so low and gravelly, it can, at times, be unbearable&quot;. In relation to a 1996 concert at a roller skating rink with Lois Maffeo, they described the music as &quot;dull to dance to, but skates can glide along to it fine&quot;.

The Michigan Daily described their album &quot;Degenerate Introduction&quot; as &quot;an open, airy fusion of punk, funk, dub, indie rock and hip-hop with a lo-fi hue&quot;. However, the newspaper criticised Johnson&#x27;s vocals, saying they were &quot;polarizing and force[s] you to become annoyed as he drowns out the empty beats&quot;.

==Discography==
The following studio recordings by D.N.S.S. were released on K Records:
* &quot;Industrial Breakdown&quot; (EP; 1995)
* &quot;Ridin&#x27; Shotgun&quot; (EP; 1995)
* &quot;Boot Party&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Bone Dry&quot; (EP; 1997)
* &quot;Out Of Your Mind&quot; (1998)
* &quot;Sideways Soul: Dub Narcotic Sound System meets the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in a Dancehall Style&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Handclappin&#x27; &quot;(EP; 2003)
* &quot;Degenerate Introduction&quot; (2004)

<doc id="795872" wikidata="Q1428137" url="?curid=795872" title="V-Disc">
<text>V-Disc (&quot;V&quot; for Victory) was a record label that was formed in 1943 to provide records for U.S. military personnel. Captain Robert Vincent supervised the label from the Special Services division.

Many popular singers, big bands, and orchestras recorded V-discs.

==History==
Under the leadership of James Caesar Petrillo, the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) was involved in the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike in which there was a recording ban on four recording companies. On October 27, 1943 George Robert Vincent convinced Petrillo to allow the union&#x27;s musicians to make records for the military as long as the discs were not sold and the masters were disposed of. Musicians who had contracts with different record labels were now able to record together for this nonprofit enterprise. A group consisting of Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, and Art Tatum recorded concerts that were released as V-Discs. Captain Vincent ran the program from the Special Services Division. Artists and repertoire responsibilities were handled by Steve Scholes and Walt Heebner, both of RCA Victor, Morty Palitz of Decca Records, and Tony Janak of Columbia Records. The program started for the Army, but soon music was provided for the Navy and Marines.

Many V-Discs contained spoken-word introductions by bandleaders and musicians wishing good luck and prayers for the soldiers. Glenn Miller in December 1943, introduced a record by saying, &quot;This is Captain Glenn Miller speaking for the Army Air Force&#x27;s Training Command Orchestra and we hope that you soldiers of the Allied forces enjoy these V-Discs that we&#x27;re making just for you.&quot; The &quot;Jubilee&quot; series, hosted by comedian Ernie &quot;Bubbles&quot; Whitman, was provided for black servicemen. The banter between Whitman and guests sometimes ventured into risque and racial humor, including the use of the ethnic slur &quot;ofay&quot; to refer to whites. In addition to a window into black entertainment styles, the Jubilee series chronicled the development of swing music on the cusp of bebop. V-disc recordings provide important archives of the Billy Eckstine Orchestra and the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. The &quot;V&quot; stands for &quot;Victory&quot; although Vincent said the &quot;V&quot; stood for &quot;Vincent&quot;.

The V-Disc program ended in 1949. Audio masters and stampers were destroyed. Leftover V-Discs at bases and on ships were discarded. On some occasions, the FBI and the Provost Marshal&#x27;s Office confiscated and destroyed V-Discs that servicemen had smuggled home. An employee at a Los Angeles record company served a prison sentence for the illegal possession of over 2,500 V-Discs.

<text>The Jacksonian Professorship of Natural Philosophy is one of the senior chairs in Natural and Experimental philosophy at Cambridge University. It was founded in 1782 by a bequest from the Reverend Richard Jackson of Tarrington, Herefordshire.

Jackson, a former fellow of Trinity College, died in 1782. He left a fifth of the income from his estate to the head gardener of the university&#x27;s physic garden and the remainder to found the Professorship of Natural and Experimental Philosophy that now bears his name. His will specified the details of the professor with much precision, including that preference should be given to candidates from Trinity and men from Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire and Cheshire, and that any holder must search for a cure for gout.

The will also stated that his lectures should promote &quot;real and useful knowledge&quot; by &quot;showing or doing something in the way of experiment upon the subject undertaken to be treated,&quot; and its early holders consequently tended towards the experimental end of the field, such as chemists and engineers. More recently, it has been decided that the professorship should permanently be associated with physics.

The first holder of the position was the mathematician and chemist Isaac Milner, elected to the post in 1783.

One result of the bequest was that a building was erected to allow public lectures for the professor, as well as the professor of botany. It was the university&#x27;s first building to be specifically designed for the teaching of science.

By 2020, the Jacksonian endowment was no longer sufficient to fund the professorship. In order to afford an appointment to the Jacksonian Professorship, a funded professorship needed to be held vacant.

<doc id="795879" wikidata="Q448013" url="?curid=795879" title="Greg Foster (hurdler)">
<text>Gregory Foster (August 4, 1958 – February 19, 2023) was an American hurdler. He was the first person in the history of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics to win three consecutive 110 meters hurdles titles (1983, 1987, and 1991). Foster was the 1981 IAAF World Cup and the 1991 World Indoor hurdling champion.

As well as his international titles, Foster was twice NCAA outdoor champion (1978 and 1980) in the 110 meters hurdles and was the NCAA 200 meters champion in 1979. He won 10 U.S. national titles, four of them outdoors in the 110 meters hurdles (1981, 1983, 1986, and 1987) and six indoors, in the 60 yard hurdles (1983, 1984, 1985), 55 meters hurdles (1987, 1988) and 60 meters hurdles (1991).

Foster broke the world indoor record for the 50 meters hurdles in 1985 (6.35 seconds) and tied that mark in 1987. He also broke the 60 meters hurdles world indoor record in 1987 with a time of 7.36. He was the American record holder in the 110 meters hurdles with a time of 13.22 seconds set at the 1978 NCAA Championships while competing for UCLA, second at the time only to Cuba&#x27;s world record holder Alejandro Casañas. Foster&#x27;s mark held as an NCAA meet record for decades and still stands as a UCLA record as of 2022.

His personal best time for the 110 meters hurdles was 13.03, run at the Weltklasse Zürich meet in 1981 in which Renaldo Nehemiah became the first man the break the 13 second barrier, with his 12.93. This once again made Foster the second-fastest hurdler of all time. He was ranked in the top ten hurdlers in the world for 15 out of 16 years 1977 to 1992. Five of those years, he was ranked number one, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1987 and 1991.

Foster was suspended from athletics for six months in 1990 after testing positive to ephedrine which he said was contained in his asthma medication.

He retired from competition in 1996 and his many achievements saw him inducted into the USATF Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Personal life and death==
Foster was born in Chicago, Illinois.

From 2015 until January 2020, he suffered from amyloidosis, a rare, life-threatening disease that does considerable damage to the heart. Despite this, he remained involved in the sport, helping the next generation as a coach. On January 18, Foster underwent heart transplant surgery at Barnes Jewish Hospital.

Foster died on 19 February 2023 aged 64.

==Track records==

As of 7 September 2024, Foster holds the following track records for 110 metres hurdles.

<doc id="795882" wikidata="Q616663" url="?curid=795882" title="Apache Cocoon">
<text>Apache Cocoon, usually abbreviated as Cocoon, is a web application framework built around the concepts of Pipeline, separation of concerns, and component-based web development. The framework focuses on XML and XSLT publishing and is built using the Java programming language. Cocoon&#x27;s use of XML is intended to improve compatibility of publishing formats, such as HTML and PDF. The content management systems Apache Lenya and Daisy have been created on top of the framework. Cocoon is also commonly used as a data warehousing ETL tool or as middleware for transporting data between systems.

==Sitemap==
Apache Cocoon uses sitemaps to allow users to control a variety of components in the Cocoon software, as well as define the client-server interactions in what Cocoon refers to as the &quot;Pipelines.&quot;

==Components==
The components within Cocoon are grouped by function.

===Matchers===
Matchers are used to match user requests such as URLs or cookies against wildcard or regular expression patterns. Each user request is tested against matchers in the sitemap until a match is made. It is within a matcher that the response to a particular request is specified.

===Generators===
Generators create a stream of data for further processing. This stream can be generated from an existing XML document or there are generators that can create XML from scratch to represent something on the server, such as a directory structure or image data.

====XSP====
One type of generator is an XML Server Page (XSP), an XML document containing tag-based directives that specify how to generate dynamic content at request time. Upon Cocoon processing, these directives are replaced by generated content so that the resulting, augmented XML document can be subject to further processing (typically an XSLT transformation). XSPs are transformed into Cocoon producers, typically as Java classes, though any scripting language for which a Java-based processor exists could also be used.

Directives can be either built-in (&quot;XSP&quot;) or user-defined processing tags, both of which are defined in &quot;logic sheets&quot;. Tags are defined using XSLT templates that describe how the tags (represented as XML nodes) are transformed into other XML nodes or into procedural code such as Java. The tags are used to embed procedural logic, substitute expressions, retrieve information from the webserver environment, and other operations.

Note that XSP is deprecated in recent releases of Cocoon.

===Transformers===
Transformers take a stream of data and change it in some way. The most common transformations are performed with XSLT to change one XML format into another. But there are also transformers that take other forms of data (SQL commands for example).

===Serializers===
A serializer turns an XML event stream into a sequence of bytes (such as HTML) that can be returned to the client. Some serializers allow you to send the data in many different formats including HTML, XHTML, PDF, RTF, SVG, WML and plain text, for example.

===Selectors===
Selectors offer the same capabilities as a switch statement. They are able to select particular elements of a request and choose the correct pipeline part to use.

===Views===
Views are mainly used for testing. A view is an exit point in a pipeline. You can put out the XML-Stream which is produced till this point. So you can see if the application is working right.

===Readers===
Publish content without parsing it (no XML processing). Used for images and such.

===Actions===
Actions are Java classes that execute some business logic or manage new content production.

==The Pipeline==
A &quot;pipeline&quot; is used to specify how the different Cocoon components interact with a given request to produce a response. A typical pipeline consists of a generator, followed by zero or more transformers, and finally a serializer.

<text>Aleksei Ilyich Chirikov (; 1703 – November 14, 1748) was a Russian navigator and captain who, along with Vitus Bering, was the first Russian to reach the northwest coast of North America. He discovered and charted some of the Aleutian Islands while he was deputy to Vitus Bering during the Great Northern Expedition.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Little is known about Chirikov&#x27;s early life other than that the Russian was born in 1703. There is a claim, which originated in 1941, that he was the son of one of Peter the Great&#x27;s master carpenters.

It is known that Chirikov began his service in the Russian Imperial Navy in 1716, and later in 1721 he graduated from the Naval Academy with the rank of Sub-lieutenant.

=== Exploration ===
In 1725–1730 and 1733–1743, he was Vitus Bering&#x27;s deputy during the First and the Second Kamchatka expeditions, having been made a captain in 1733.

In June 1741 Chirikov in the &quot;St Paul&quot; and Vitus Bering in the &quot;St Peter&quot;, who he was serving under, left Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and headed east. Some time after 20 June they were separated by a storm and never saw each other again. On 15 July 1741 Chirikov saw land at Baker Island off Prince of Wales Island at the south end of the Alaska Panhandle. This was about 450 miles southeast of Bering&#x27;s landfall near Mount St. Elias at the north end of the panhandle. Unable to find a harbor he sailed north along Baranov Island past the later Russian base at Sitka. He sent out a longboat to find an anchorage. When it did not return after a week he sent out his second longboat which also failed to return. Now without any small boats Chirikov had no way of searching for the two longboats or landing on the coast to explore or replenish his supply of fresh water. After waiting as long as possible, he abandoned the longboats to their fate and on 27 July sailed west. He sighted the Kenai Peninsula, Kodiak Island and Adak Island near the western end of the Aleutians. With water critically low he reached Petropavlovsk on 12 October 1741.
In 1742, Chirikov was in charge of a search party for Bering&#x27;s ship &quot;St. Peter&quot;. During this trip, he located Attu Island. Chirikov took part in creating the final map of the Russian discoveries in the Pacific Ocean (1746). In 1746 was assigned the Director of Academy of the Naval Guard, St. Petersburg. Chirikov&#x27;s name is given to Capes of the Kyūshū Island, Attu Island, Anadyr Bay, Tauyskaya Bay, an underwater mountain in the Pacific Ocean, Chirikof Island and Cape Chirikof at the westernmost point of Baker Island.

Chirikov died on November 14, 1748, in Moscow due to scurvy.

<doc id="795894" wikidata="Q2123902" url="?curid=795894" title="R. L. Burnside">
<text>R. L. Burnside (November 23, 1926 – September 1, 2005) was an American Hill country blues singer, songwriter and guitarist. He played music for most of his life but received little recognition until 1995 when Burnside recorded and toured with Jon Spencer, garnering crossover appeal and introducing his music to a new fan base, particularly in the punk and garage rock scenes.

==Life and career==

===1926–1959: Early years===
Burnside was born in 1926 to Earnest Burnside and Josie Malone, in either Harmontown, College Hill, or Blackwater Creek, all of which are in the rural part of Lafayette County, Mississippi, near the area that would be covered by Sardis Lake a few years later. His first name is given variously as R. L., Rural, Robert Lee, Rule, or Ruel. His father left the family early on, and R. L. grew up with his mother, grandparents, and several siblings.

He played the harmonica and dabbled with playing guitar, beginning at the age of 16. He said he first played in public at age 21 or 22. He learned mostly from Mississippi Fred McDowell, who had lived near Burnside since Burnside was a child. He first heard McDowell playing at age 7 or 8 and eventually joined his gigs to play a late set. Other local teachers were his wife&#x27;s brother, his uncle-in-law Ranie Burnette, who was a popular player from Senatobia, the mostly unknown Henry Harden, Son Hibbler, Jesse Vortis, and possibly Stonewall Mays. Burnside cited church singing and fife-and-drum picnics as elements of his childhood&#x27;s musical landscape, and he credited Muddy Waters, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, and John Lee Hooker as influences in adulthood.

In the late 1940s he moved to Chicago, where his father had lived since he separated from his mother, in the hope of finding better economic opportunities. He found jobs at metal and glass factories, had the company of Muddy Waters (his cousin-in-law), and enjoyed the blues scene on Maxwell Street. But things did not turn out as he had hoped; within the span of one year his father, two brothers, and two uncles were all murdered in the city.

Three years after coming to Chicago, Burnside went back south. He married Alice Mae Taylor in 1949 or 1950, his second marriage. He moved several times in the 1950s, between Memphis, Tennessee, the Mississippi Delta and the hill country of northern Mississippi. During his time in the Delta, he met bluesmen Robert Lockwood Jr. and Aleck &quot;Rice&quot; Miller. It seems it was around that time that Burnside killed a man, possibly at a craps game, was convicted of murder and incarcerated in Parchman Farm. He would later relate that his boss at the time had arranged to release him after six months, as he needed Burnside&#x27;s skills as a tractor driver.

===1960–1990: Part-time musician===
He spent the next 45 years, not unlike his early years, in Panola and Tate counties, in northern Mississippi. At first he kept to particularly remote dwellings, working into the 1980s as a sharecropper growing cotton and soybean, as a commercial fisherman on the Tallahatchie River, selling his catch from door to door, and as a truck driver. Later he moved closer to Holly Springs. After coming back to Mississippi, and especially after marrying, he picked more local gigs, playing guitar in juke joints and bars (some under his management), at picnics and at his own open house parties, and at the occasional festival.

His earliest recordings were made in 1967 by George Mitchell, then a graduate student of journalism. Mitchell and his wife went on a 13-day summer trip in Mississippi, which resulted in the first recordings of several country blues artists. He came to Burnside&#x27;s house near Coldwater on the advice of fife player and maker Othar Turner. Mitchell wrote that Fred McDowell had not told him about Burnside, likely because Burnside posed &quot;big-time competition&quot;. Six of the songs, played on an acoustic guitar lent by Mitchell, were released on Arhoolie Records after two years; nine others are on later records. Another album of acoustic material was recorded in 1969 for Adelphi Records, not to be released until thirty years later. Recordings from 1975 had a similar fate.

These recordings featured Burnside playing acoustic guitar and singing, and a few tracks had harmonica accompaniment by W.C. Veasey or Ulysse Red Ramsey. Although not recorded, by that time Burnside also played electric guitar. His early repertoire came from hill country and Memphis favorites, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, hits by Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Elmore James, and sides by Yank Rachell, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, and Lonesome Sundown.

In 1969, he performed for the first time outside the United States, at a program in Montreal with Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins and John Lee Hooker. As a solo performer, he made three tours in Europe, appearing before enthusiastic audiences. In 1974 he played at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, the first of nine of these festivals at which he performed. Also in 1974, Tav Falco filmed Burnside in the Brotherhood Sportsmen&#x27;s Lodge, a juke joint he ran at the time near Como. His performance featured the slide guitarist Kenny Brown, Burnside&#x27;s friend and understudy, whom he began tutoring in 1971 and claimed as his &quot;adopted son&quot;. In 1978 Burnside was filmed by Alan Lomax in what remained mostly outtakes of the television documentary &quot;The Land Where the Blues Began&quot;.

A series of recordings in 1979 by the musicologist David Evans for his record label High Water was the first to feature Burnside&#x27;s Sound Machine, which included his sons Duwayne and Daniel on guitar, his son Joseph on bass, and his son-in-law Calvin Jackson on drums. The band was active mostly in home settings but also joined Burnside in Europe in 1980 and 1983. They offered a rare fusion of rural and urban blues, funk, R&amp;B and soul, which appealed to young Mississippians; their sets included covers of songs by Jimmy Rogers, Little Walter, Albert King and Little Milton. An EP, &quot;Sound Machine Groove&quot;, was released by Evans&#x27;s label in the US but had next to no distribution. Apart from it, one full album of the same title, a debut of sorts, was licensed for prompt European release by Disques Vogue, and another hour&#x27;s worth was released by the Memphis label Inside Sounds in 2001.

From 1980 to 1986, Burnside recorded for the Dutch label Old Swingmaster and for the French label Arion, mostly solo or with harmonica accompaniment: Johnny Woods served on some occasions (he also recorded as a lead artist, with guitar accompaniment by Burnside); Curtis Salgado served once in a New Orleans session. Selections focused on hill country material and starker, less danceable songs by Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. The results were four more LP releases and a videotape under his name, all in European markets.

In the mid-1980s Burnside retired from farm work and became more busy with the music. For about 12 years he worked with New Orleans–based harpist Jon (Joni) Morris Neremberg (or Nuremberg). He appeared before American crowds at such occasions as the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair, the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition, and the 1986 San Francisco Blues Festival, between international tours. By the mid-1980s he toured about &quot;once a year or maybe twice&quot;, and by one report in 1985 he had been to Europe 17 times. Recordings from his time with Morris were eventually released on two records, both produced by M.C. Records and Louis X. Erlanger: &quot;Acoustic Stories&quot; (a session from 1988) and &quot;Well, Well, Well&quot; (a 2001 compilation of informal recordings provided by Morris).
===1991–2005: Commercial success and declining health===

In the late 1970s or early 1980s, Burnside was introduced and struck a partnership with Junior Kimbrough. Roughly a decade later, his own Burnside Palace had shut down and the family lived next to the Kimbroughs&#x27; new Junior&#x27;s Place in Chulahoma, Mississippi and collaborated with the counterpart musical family. The music writer Robert Palmer, teaching for a time in the University of Mississippi in Oxford, frequented the scene with some celebrity musicians, which led to the making in 1990 of the documentary &quot;Deep Blues&quot;, in which Burnside was prominently featured.

Burnside began recording for the Oxford, Mississippi, label Fat Possum Records in 1991. The label, dedicated to recording aging north Mississippi bluesmen such as Burnside and Junior Kimbrough, was founded by two students who had been attending their performances for some years—Peter Redvers-Lee, editor of &quot;Living Blues&quot; magazine, and Matthew Johnson, a writer for the magazine. Burnside remained with Fat Possum from that time until his death. Their first output was &quot;Bad Luck City&quot; (1992), featuring the Sound Machine. The next, &quot;Too Bad Jim&quot; (1994), was recorded at Junior&#x27;s Place and produced by Palmer, with support from Calvin Jackson and Kenny Brown. After Jackson moved to Holland, Burnside found a new stable band and would usually perform with Brown and drummer Cedric Burnside, his grandson. R.L. played his first art museum gig when Grammy nominee/producer Larry Hoffman brought him to Baltimore to play the Walters Art Museum in February 1993 as the feature of a Baltimore Folk Music Society concert.

In a New York concert around the release of the documentary &quot;Deep Blues&quot;, he attracted the attention of Jon Spencer, the leader of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. He started touring with this group in 1995, both as an opening act and sitting in, gaining many new fans. The 1996 album &quot;A Ass Pocket of Whiskey&quot; was recorded with Spencer&#x27;s band and was marketed for their audience, but was credited to Burnside. It gained critical acclaim and received praise from Bono and Iggy Pop; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;it sounds like no other blues album ever released&quot; and an author there picked it for a year&#x27;s end critics&#x27; poll, but &quot;Living Blues&quot; opined that it was &quot;perhaps the worst blues album ever made&quot;.
After parting ways with the Blues Explosion, the label turned to produce music in which recorded materials were remixed by producer Tom Rothrock with an eye to techno, downtempo and hip-hop listeners. The experiment started with a track in &quot;Mr. Wizard&quot; (1997), an album based on a variety of sessions, and matured into a full album with &quot;Come On In&quot; (1998). The recording artists themselves heard only the final product, but they conceded that with time they came to like it, in part influenced by its popularity.

Burnside continued to tour, perhaps more extensively than ever. He opened for the Beastie Boys, was a musical guest on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Reverb&quot;, provided entertainment at private events such as Richard Gere&#x27;s birthday party, and participated in shared or showcase bills with other Fat Possum artists, notably T-Model Ford, Paul &quot;Wine&quot; Jones, CeDell Davis, Robert Cage and Robert Belfour. An influx of visitors and young musicians were attracted to Junior&#x27;s Place, before it burned down in 2000.

Documentary coverage of his contemporaneous life and work expanded too. Bradley Beesley filmed the 60-minute &quot;Hill Stomp Hollar&quot;, a film about Burnside and other Fat Possum artists, that received a positive response at the 1999 SXSW Film Festival premiere, but that was not approved for release by the label. Much of Beesley&#x27;s footage and many of his interviews became part of the 77-minute &quot;You See Me Laughin″&quot;, directed by Mandy Stein; it was released by Fat Possum in 2003. A 1999 date at Paris&#x27; New Morning club, with Brown and Cedric, was an occasion at which the French blues singer Sophie Kay (also known as Sophie Kertesz) filmed a 52-minute documentary.

Before long, however, Burnside was in declining health. He had an ear infection and underwent heart surgery in 1999. As his tours decreased to a minimum, &quot;Wish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down&quot; (2000) was released, which relegated guitar work to other players (Rick Holmstrom, Smokey Hormel, John Porter) but used Burnside&#x27;s vocals. After a heart attack in 2001, his doctor advised him to stop drinking; Burnside did, but he reported that change left him unable to play. Fat Possum rebounded with &quot;A Bothered Mind&quot; (2004), an album that used previously recorded guitar tracks, and included collaborations with Kid Rock and Lyrics Born.

These remix albums received mixed reviews, some describing the results as &quot;unnatural&quot; while others lauded the playful spirit, or &quot;the way it yokes authentic blues feeling to new technology&quot;. Commercially, the remixes were successful; each surpassed its previous in Billboard&#x27;s Top Blues Albums chart, as they stayed there for 12–18 weeks&#x27; periods (but none entered into the more competitive Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs), and two tracks from &quot;Come On In&quot; were included in &quot;The Sopranos″&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Let My Baby Ride&quot; off &quot;Come On In&quot; received significant airplay and an ensuing music clip was slotted in MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;; the album&#x27;s &quot;Rollin&#x27; &amp; Tumblin&#x27;&quot; accompanied a 2002 Nissan TV commercial. But the live, unremixed album &quot;Burnside on Burnside&quot; (2001) peaked at number 4 of Billboard&#x27;s Blues Albums chart and was nominated for a Grammy. – the last article to catch Burnside as an active bandleader, recorded in January 2001 with Brown and Cedric.

In between, Fat Possum licensed and released &quot;First Recording&quot; (2003), comprising George Mitchell&#x27;s 1967 recordings in its fullest edition yet, in traditional format. In addition, the 1990s and 2000s saw release of several recordings from previous decades by other labels, as well as a couple of new recordings by HighTone Records.

===Death and legacy===
Another heart attack in November 2002 resulted in a surgery in 2003, and short-circuited any future career plans he had. Yet Burnside continued as guest singer on occasions, such as at Bonnaroo Music Festival, 2004, his last public appearance. He died at St. Francis Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 1, 2005, at the age of 78. Services were held at Rust College, in Holly Springs, with burial in the Free Springs Cemetery, in Harmontown. Around the time of his death, he resided in Byhalia, Mississippi. His immediate survivors included:
*His wife: Alice Mae Taylor Burnside (1932–2008), married 1949
*His daughters: Mildred Jean Burnside (1949–2010), Linda Jackson, Brenda Kay Brooks, and Pamela Denise Burnside
*His sons: Melvin Burnside, R.L. Burnside Jr. (1954–2010), Calvin Burnside, Joseph Burnside, Daniel Burnside, Duwayne Burnside, Dexter Burnside, Garry Burnside, and Rodger Harmon
*His sisters: Lucille Burnside, Verlyn Burnside, and Mat Burnside
*His brother: Jesse Monia
*His 35 grandchildren: Cedric Burnside
*32 great-grandchildren

Members of his extended family continue to play blues in the Holly Springs area and in wider circles:
*His son Duwayne Burnside has played guitar with the North Mississippi Allstars (&quot;Polaris&quot;; &quot;Hill Country Revue with R. L. Burnside&quot;). He has operated music venues named after Burnside and Alice Mae in Chulahoma, Memphis, Waterford, and Holly Springs
*His grandson Cedric Burnside has released six albums with four musical partners and toured with Kenny Brown and others
*His son Garry Burnside used to play bass guitar with Junior Kimbrough, North Mississippi Allstars, and Hill Country Revue; in 2006 he released an album with Cedric
*His son-in-law Calvin Jackson recorded with blues musicians of Burnside&#x27;s generation and younger
*His grandson Kent Burnside is also a touring blues musician. Kent is currently touring with the Flood Brothers and released an album with them in 2016
*His grandson Cody released four albums and toured with the family and his own band

Burnside won one W. C. Handy Award in 2000 (Traditional Blues Male Artist of the Year), two in 2002 (Traditional Blues Male Artist of the Year; Traditional Blues Album of the Year, &quot;Burnside on Burnside&quot;), and one in 2003 (Traditional Blues Male Artist of The Year); he had 11 unsuccessful nominations in 8 years for the awards, starting in 1982, as well as one for a Grammy. Several of the Mississippi Blues Trail markers, which have been erected since 2006, mention him. In 2014 he was inducted to the Blues Hall of Fame in Memphis.

Burnside&#x27;s fellow Fat Possum musicians The Black Keys credit him as an influence and interpolated his &quot;Skinny Woman&quot; into their track &quot;Busted&quot;. The Black Keys would perform two Burnside covers on their album Delta Kream in 2021 featuring Kenny Brown. Brown along with bassist Eric Deaton would also join The Black Keys for their 2022 tour (supporting the release of Dropout Boogie) to perform the Burnside covers live.

The electronica musician St. Germain used samples of Burnside&#x27;s &quot;Nightmare Blues&quot; throughout the track &quot;How Dare You&quot;, on his 2015 album.

==Style==

Burnside had a powerful, expressive voice, that did not fail with old age but rather grew richer, and played both electric and acoustic guitar, with and without a slide. His drone-heavy style was more characteristic of North Mississippi hill country blues than Delta blues. Like other country blues musicians, he did not always adhere to strict 12- or 16-bar blues patterns, often adding extra beats to a measure as he saw fit. His rhythms are often based on the fife and drum blues of north Mississippi.

As was the case with his role model John Lee Hooker, Burnside&#x27;s earliest recordings sound quite similar to one another, even repetitive, in vocal and instrumental styling. Many of these songs eschew traditional chord changes in favor of a single chord or a simple bassline pattern that repeats throughout. Burnside played the guitar fingerstyle—without a pick—and often in open-G tuning. His vocal style is characterized by a tendency to &quot;break&quot; briefly into falsetto, usually at the end of long notes.

Like his contemporary T-Model Ford, Burnside favored a stripped-down approach to the blues, marked by a quality of rawness. He and his later managers and reviewers maintained his persona as a hard-working man leading a life of struggle, a heavy drinker, latent criminal singing songs of swagger and rebellion.

Burnside knew many toasts—African American narrative folk poems such as &quot;Signifying monkey&quot; and &quot;Tojo Told Hitler&quot;—and fondly recited them between songs at his concerts and on recordings. He narrated long jokes in concerts and social events, and many sources noted his quick wit and charisma.

<text>Giyasuddin Muhammad Uzbek Khan, better known as Özbeg (1282–1341), was the longest-reigning khan of the Golden Horde (1313–1341), under whose rule the state reached its zenith. He was succeeded by his son Tini Beg. He was the son of Toghrilcha and grandson of Mengu-Timur, who had been khan of the Golden Horde from 1266 to 1280.

== Biography ==
Öz Beg&#x27;s father Togrilcha was one of the Genghisid princes that overthrew Tode-Mengu (r. 1280–1287). Later, he was executed by his brother Toqta (1291–1312). Toqta took Togrilcha&#x27;s widow for wife and sent his son Öz Beg to exile in a distant region of the Golden Horde: either Khorazm or the country of Circassians.

Converted to Islam by Ibn Abdul Hamid, a Sunni Sufi Bukharan sayyid and sheikh of the Yasavi order, Öz Beg assumed the throne upon the death of his uncle Toqta in January 1313 with the help of the former Khans&#x27; vizier Temur Qutlugh and of Bulaghan (or Bayalun) khatun. His conversion is also mentioned in Russian chronicles, but without any detailed information; the standard entry notes that the khan Toqta died in the year 6821 (1313) and the new khan Öz Beg took the throne and &quot;became a Muslim&quot; (&quot;obesermenilsia&quot;).

At first, many Mongol nobles were against him and organized a plot to kill the new khan. Öz Beg discovered the plot and crushed the rebels. His adoption of Islam as a state religion led to a conspiracy of Shamanist and Buddhist princes, whom he subdued severely. Öz Beg determinedly spread Islam among the Golden Horde and allowed missionary activities to expand in the surrounding regions. Öz Beg found out that his competitor was backed by the envoys of the Great Khan Ayurbarwada Buyantu and this fact helped deteriorate his relationship with the Yuan dynasty. The last of his rebellious relatives was shamanist Ilbasan of the eastern half of the Golden Horde, who was murdered in 1320. Öz Beg installed the Muslim Mubarak Khwaja as a replacement to the throne of the White Horde, but he discouraged their independence. In the long run, Islam enabled the Khan to eliminate inter-factional struggles in the Horde and to stabilize state institutions. Russian scholar Lev Gumilev wrote that in this manner was Öz Beg able to turn the khanate into a sultanate. From Öz Beg onwards, the khans of the Golden Horde were all Muslim.

Öz Beg was very tolerant of Christians as exemplified by a letter of thanks he received from Pope John XXII in which the Christian leader thanked Öz Beg for his kind treatment of Christians. Öz Beg had sent a letter to the Metropolitan Peter which stated:By the will and power, the greatness and most high! Let no man insult the metropolitan church of which Peter is head, or his service or his churchman; let no man seize their property, goods or people, let no man meddle in the affairs of the church...Their laws, their churches and monasteries and chapels shall be respected; whoever condemns or blames this religion, shall not be allowed to excuse himself under any pretext, but shall be punished with death. The khan also granted tax exemption to the Franciscan missionaries in the Golden Horde, following the Mongolian fiscal tradition.

== Reign ==


=== Military and politics ===

Öz Beg maintained one of the largest armies in the world, which exceeded 300,000 warriors. He employed his military clout to conduct campaigns against the Ilkhanate in Azerbaijan in 1319, 1325 and 1335. Ilkhanid commander Chupan repulsed one Öz Beg&#x27;s first two attempts and even invaded deep into the Jochid Ulus in 1325. Öz Beg found an ally against the Ilkhanids in Mamluk Egypt; indeed, one of Cairo&#x27;s squares was named after him. The Khan had the daughter of previous Khan&#x27;s sister, Princess Tulunbuya, married to a Mamluk sultan, but she died in a few years. The khan instructed his merchants to lend 27,000 dinars to the Mamluk ambassador in order to finance the feast for the bride at Sarai. Soon after Öz Beg was disappointed with the Mamluk sultan&#x27;s divorce with Tulunbuya and indecisiveness regarding the joint invasion of Ilkhanate. In 1323, a peace treaty was signed between Egypt and the Ilkhanate. This situation nullified the alliance and the Mamluks refused to invade the Ilkhanate. Öz Beg&#x27;s next incursion coincided with Abu Said&#x27;s death. However, the weather turned bad and the new Ilkhan Arpa Ke&#x27;un came with a large force; Öz Beg&#x27;s army was forced to withdraw.

Prior to and during the Esen Buqa–Ayurbarwada war, Chagatai Khan Esen Buqa I attempted to gain the support of Öz Beg Khan against Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan, the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire and the Emperor of the Yuan dynasty, in 1313 and 1316. Esen Buqa warned Öz Beg that the Great Khan would overthrow him from the throne of the Horde and install another Khan from the Jochids instead. However, Öz Beg&#x27;s vizier convinced him not to believe this and the Khan refused to help Esen Buqa. Nevertheless, remembering their support for the rival claimant to his throne, Öz Beg tried his best to eliminate every influence and inspiration of the Yuan dynasty on the Golden Horde in the early part of his reign. The Khan&#x27;s diplomatic relationship with the Yuan, however, improved in 1324. Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan granted him the &quot;de jure&quot; rights to rule the Golden Horde (Ulus of Jochi in the Yuan sources). By the 1330s, Öz Beg had begun sending tribute to the Mongol Yuan Emperors and received his share from Jochid possessions in China and Mongolia in exchange.

Öz Beg was engaged in wars with Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire from 1320 to 1332. He repeatedly raided Thrace, partly in service of tsar Michael Shishman of Bulgaria war against both Byzantium and Serbia that began in 1319. His armies pillaged Thrace for 40 days in 1324 and for 15 days in 1337, taking 300,000 captives. After Öz Beg&#x27;s death in 1341, his successors did not continue his aggressive policy and contact with Bulgaria lapsed. His attempt to reassert Mongol control over Serbia was unsuccessful in 1330. Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III purportedly gave his illegitimate daughter in marriage to Öz Beg but relations turned sour at the end of Andronikos&#x27;s reign, and the Mongols mounted raids on Thrace between 1320 and 1324 until the Byzantine port of Vicina Macaria was occupied by the Mongols. Andronikos&#x27;s daughter, who adopted the name Bayalun, managed to escape back to the Byzantine Empire, apparently fearing her forced conversion to Islam. In the south-east of the Kingdom of Hungary, Wallachia and its ruler Basarab I became an independent power with the support of Öz Beg after 1324.

Öz Beg allowed Genoese merchants and mariners, who had been harassed by Tokhta, to settle in Crimea. However, the Mongols sacked Sudak under Khan Öz Beg in 1322 as a result of a clash between Christians and Muslims in the city. The Genoese merchants in the other towns were not molested in 1322. The Pope himself intervened and asked Öz Beg to restore the Roman Catholic churches that were destroyed in revenge, because of the Christian clash against Muslims in the city. Öz Beg was friendly towards the Pope and exchanged letters and gifts. Khan Öz Beg signed a new trade treaty with the Genoese in 1339 and allowed them to rebuild the walls of Caffa. In 1332 he had allowed the Venetians to establish a colony at Tanais on the Don.

=== New Sarai ===

During the reign of Öz Beg, Sarai (literally meaning &quot;palace&quot; in Turkish and Uzbek, and a hotel / inn / temporary residence in Persian and Urdu) was more quickly becoming a main commercial center and industrial trading center of the country rather than just a political center. The expression of Mongol camp mentality, following Ash and the nearby absence of some structures.

To successfully spread Islam, it was necessary to build a mosque and other &quot;elaborate places&quot; like baths, an important element of Muslim culture. Sarai attracted merchants from European, Asian and Islamic countries as well as Middle East. Slave trade flourished due to strengthening ties with Mamluk Sultanate. Successful commercial revolutions require new markets and caravans: &quot;places where merchants find their way.&quot; Growth of wealth and increasing needs of production always stimulate population growth. This did not suffice solely in Sarai. The accretion of the dwellings in the region transformed the capital into the center of a large Muslim government, giving it the appropriate aspect and status. Öz Beg actually came to build a new city, which received the official name Saray al-Jedid or New Sarai.

=== Relationship with Russian princes ===

Öz Beg supported the earliest princes of Muscovy—his brother-in-law Yury of Moscow (or Yuri) and Yury&#x27;s successor Ivan Kalita (or Ivan Daniilovich, later, Ivan I of Moscow)—against their relatives, the westward-leaning Princes of Tver. Four of these latter rulers—Mikhail of Tver, his sons Dmitry (or Dmitri; nicknamed &quot;The Terrible Eyes&quot;) and Alexander Mikhailovich, (or Aleksandr) and his grandson Theodor (or Fyodor)—were all killed in Sarai at Öz Beg&#x27;s behest.

In 1317, Mikhail Yaroslavich defeated Yuri at a village called Bortenevo. Mikhail captured Yuri&#x27;s wife, Konchaka, who was the Khan&#x27;s sister. Unluckily, Konchaka died when she was in the custody of Mikhail; Yuri announced to the Khan that she had been poisoned by order of Mikhail. He and Yuri were summoned to the court of Golden Horde for a trial, after which Mikhail was beheaded in November 1318. 

Following Yury&#x27;s machinations, which prompted the Khan to grant the yarlik (patent of office for the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir) to Moscow and led to their father&#x27;s execution by the Horde, Dmitry and his brother, Alexander, fought a series of battles with Yury and intrigued against him at the Horde, culminating in Dmitry&#x27;s acquisition of the yarlik of office for the grand princely throne in 1322, after he had persuaded the khan that Yury had appropriated a large portion of the tribute due to the Horde. Yury was summoned to the Horde in Sarai for a trial but, before any formal investigation, was killed by Dmitry, November 21, 1325. Öz Beg waited to punish Dmitri and eventually he arrested the Prince of Tver for the murder, executing him in 1326.

When the Khan&#x27;s cousin, the baskak Shevkal, and his Tatars were killed in Tver and a rebellion erupted there in mid-August 1327, Dmitry&#x27;s successor as Prince of Tver and Grand Prince of Vladimir-Suzdal, his brother Alexander Mikhailovich, fled first to Novgorod—which turned him away—and then to Pskov—which made him its Prince—in order to escape a punitive expedition of 50,000 Mongol-Tatars and Muscovites, which was headed by his cousin, Yury&#x27;s brother and successor Ivan Daniilovich. Tver&#x27;s uprising against the Horde was bloodily suppressed by the Muscovite and Tatar forces in 1327. Öz Beg appointed Ivan to position of Grand Duke of Vladimir in 1332; that marked the true beginning of the rise of the Muscovites. Alexander, after many travails, including exile in Sweden and Lithuania, eventually prospered in Pskov, under the patronage of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania.
He sent his son Fyodor to the Horde, with tribute and seeking forgiveness, in 1335; the Khan pardoned Alexander and he was given the princely yarlik to Tver once again in 1337. Unfortunately, his greatest enemy, his cousin Ivan, once more set the Horde&#x27;s Khan against him with the aid of intrigue. Alexander was summoned to the Horde again and was executed at the hand of Khan Öz Beg; Tver was then pillaged and many of its citizens massacred.
Öz Beg welcomed Ivan&#x27;s sons and made Simeon Grand Prince (duke) in 1340. Simeon was given more powers by the Khan to counter Lithuania&#x27;s growing power. Öz Beg also launched military expeditions into Lithuania, as it was clear that it threatened Mongol dominance in Russia.

===Relationship with Ruthenian princes===

After Öz Beg&#x27;s army killed Lev II and his brother Andrey (co-kings of Galicia-Volhynia, and last of the Rurikid dynasty) in 1323, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland had access to control over Galicia-Volhynia. The Lithuanians defeated the Rus&#x27; boyars and occupied Kiev and its surrounding areas. In 1337, the joint Russian and Horde army penetrated to Lublin. At the request of the Galician nobleman Dmytro Dedko, the khan sent 40,000 cavalries against King Casimir III, which was divided into the Vistula.

==Family==

Öz Beg married several wives and concubines. It is not always possible to determine which mother gave birth to which child.

* Bulughan Khatun (c. 1312) — widow of Toghrilcha and Toqta
* Bayalun Khatun the Elder (d. 1323)

* Tulun Beg 
* Iran Beg (father of Kildi Beg)

* A daughter (by Bayalun Khatun the Elder?) — married to Amir Ali b. Arzaq
* A daughter (by Taydula Khatun?) — married to Harun Beg, son of Amir Qutlu Temür

==Personality==
Many Arab and Persian authors of the 14th–15th centuries described Öz Beg Khan as an able statesman and a good-hearted, caring person. Ibn Battuta, for instance, who was granted a personal audience with him in 1333, highly praised the Khan and wrote the following: &quot;He is one of those seven kings who are the greatest and most powerful kings of the world.&quot; Historian al-Mufaddal described him as a young man of good appearance, excellent character, a fine Muslim, brave and energetic. Geographer and historian Al-Ayni wrote: &quot;He was a brave and courageous man, religious and pious, revered jurists, loved scientists, listened to them, trusted them, was merciful to them, visited the sheikhs and did good deeds to them.&quot;

Al-Birzali, for example, wrote: &quot;When this king Tokhta died, Öz Beg Khan, a man of about thirty years old, reigned after him. He professed Islam, was distinguished by his intelligence, good looks and figure.&quot; He also wrote: &quot;a young man of good appearance, good temper, an excellent Muslim and a brave man.&quot; Turkmen historian Adh-Dhahabi speaks of him in the same manner: &quot;... a brave hero, handsome in appearance, a Muslim, who destroyed many emirs and wizards.&quot; Even the Persian historian Wassaf, who is thought to have been unfriendly to Öz Beg Khan, spoke of him with great praise: &quot;The pious prince Öz Beg... possesses divine faith and royal splendor.&quot;

The name &quot;Öz Beg&quot; was of Turkic origin and had been mentioned in the Middle East even before the campaigns of Genghis Khan. This name is found in Osama Bin Munqidh&#x27;s &quot;Book of Edification&quot; that describes the events that took place in Iran under the Seljuqs. Author notes that one of the generals of the army of the ruler of Hamadan, Bursuq, in 1115–1116, was the &quot;emir of the troops&quot; – Öz Beg – the ruler of Mosul. According to Rashid al-Din Hamadani, the last representative of the Ildegizid Turkic dynasty, who ruled in Tabriz, was called Öz Beg Muzaffar (1210–1225).

<text>is a series of cliffs on the Sea of Japan in Japan. It is located in the Antō part of Mikuni-chō in Sakai, Fukui Prefecture. The cliffs average in height and stretch for . The area is part of the Echizen-Kaga Kaigan Quasi-National Park.

==Formation==
The cliffs&#x27; rocks were originally formed 12 to 13 million years ago during the Miocene Epoch due to various volcanic activities, and were created by magma mixing with sedimentary rock to form columnar joints of pyroxene andesite containing Plagioclase crystals, Augite and Enstatite crystals in pentagonal or hexagonal shapes, which has been eroded by the sea. The area received protection by the national government in 1935 as a Natural Monument.

==Legends==
One legend has it that a corrupt Buddhist priest from , a local temple, so enraged the populace that they dragged him from the temple to the sea and, at Tōjinbō, threw him into the sea. His ghost is still said to haunt the area.

An alternate legend says that the name Tōjinbō comes from a dissolute Buddhist monk. According to the legend, a Buddhist monk named Tōjinbō, who was disliked by everyone, fell in love with a beautiful princess named Aya. Tōjinbō was tricked by another admirer of Princess Aya and was pushed off these cliffs. The legend says that ever after that time Tōjinbō&#x27;s vengeful ghost would go on a rampage around the same time every year at this place, causing strong winds and rain. Some decades later, an itinerant priest took pity on Tōjinbō and held a memorial service for him. After that, the storms ceased.
==Suicides==

Tōjinbō is also a well-known place in Japan to commit suicide. According to statistics, as many as 25 people commit suicide by jumping off the high cliffs annually, a number which has risen and fallen with Japan&#x27;s national economic hardships and unemployment rates. In the 2000s, Yukio Shige, a retired police officer, frustrated at having had to fish so many bodies out of the sea and the inaction of local authorities, began patrolling the cliffs for potential jumpers.

Although 14 people committed suicide there in 2016, in 2017, there had been no suicides for months. Yukio Shige says it is partly because many people come there to catch rare creatures in the mobile phone game Pokémon Go.

<text>Onegesius () was a powerful Hunnic &quot;logades&quot; (minister) who supposedly held power second only to Attila the Hun. According to Priscus he &quot;seated on a chair to the right of the king&quot; i.e. Attila.

==History==
Priscus, who was on a mission to Attila in 448 or 449 AD, says that Onegesius lived in the same very populous village Attila resided. He recounts: 

According to Onegesius&#x27;s order Priscus and Maximinus were greeted by his wife at his compound. That the honour and respect of his supporters were important to Attila is shown from Priscus testimony: 

Priscus recounts a rare story of a Greek he encountered in the village, and who managed to get freedom from the Huns, but decided to live among them: 

Onegesius and his brother Skottas were persons of special interest to the Romans in their failed plot to assassinate Attila in 448 or 449 AD, which included Chrysaphius and Hun Edeco, but Onegesius was most of the time away. Priscus recounts &quot;Since Onegesius was away, I said, he [Skottas] needed to support us, and more his brother, in pursuit of this good business. I said we knew Attila followed his guidance too, but we would not firmly believe the reports about him unless we came to know his power through experience. He replied that no one any longer doubted Attila deemed his words and deeds equal to his brother&#x27;s. And he immediately mounted his horse and rode to Attila&#x27;s tent&quot;.

The barbarians acted cleverly and &quot;awaited Onegesios&#x27;s return in order to deliver the gifts we ourselves wanted to give and those the emperor sent&quot;. Onegesios &quot;along with the eldest (probably Ellac) of Attila&#x27;s children, had been sent to the Akateri, a Scythian people, whom he was bringing into an alliance with Attila&quot;. As the Akatziroi tribes and clans were ruled by different leaders, emperor Theodosius II tried with gifts to spread animosity among them, but the gifts were not delivered according to rank, Kouridachos, warned and called Attila against fellow leaders. So Attila did, Kardach stayed with his tribe or clan in own territory, while the rest of the Akatziroi became subjected to Attila. He &quot;desired to make his eldest son their king, and so sent Onegesios to do it&quot;.

Maximinus, not knowing that the plot failed, tried to bribe Onegesius, &quot;that the time has come for Onegesios to have greater fame among men, if he would go to the emperor, use his intelligence to understand their disputes and establish harmony between the Romans and the Huns. It would, he said, not only be thenceforward advantageous to both nations but it would also provide many benefits for his own house: he himself and his children would forever be friends of the emperor and his descendants&quot;. It was supposed to be done by crossing into Roman territory, establishing relations with the emperor, studying and resolving the causes of the disputes. Onegesius responded: 

In the end he composed along his secretaries and Roustikios the letter according to Attila&#x27;s will which has been delivered to the emperor. He also released the wife of certain Sullos for 500 gold coins, and his children sent as a gift to the emperor. They were captured in the fall of Ratiaria.

==Etymology==
Onegesius&#x27;s name is attested in Greek as (). The same name may be attested in the &quot;Vita Sancti Lupi&quot; as Hunigasius. Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen and Omeljan Pritsak both considered the endings -os/us or -ios/ius to be a Greek addition to the name.

Maenchen-Helfen considered the name to be of East Germanic origin, reconstructing it as &quot;Hunigis&quot;, a name attested elsewhere. He argues that the first element, &quot;hun-&quot;, most likely means either &quot;cub of a bear, young man&quot; or &quot;high&quot;.

Omeljan Pritsak derived &quot;Onegesi&quot; / &quot;Hunigasi&quot; from roots akin to Mongolian &quot;*ünen&quot; (truth) and the Oghuz Turkic suffix &quot;gās-i&quot;. The reconstructed form is actually an epithet &quot;*üne-gāsi&quot; (honest, faithful, truthful, loyal), which was shown by Onegesius in his loyal behaviour toward Attila.

Others have suggested Turkic etymologies. L. Rásonyi derived the name from Turkic &quot;oneki&quot; (twelve), an etymology that Maenchen-Helfen rejects. F. Altheim and R. Stiehl derived it from Turkic &quot;on-iyiz&quot;, meaning &quot;he who commands ten&quot;, a reference to the steppe system of organizing command in groups of ten.

<text>Wilde Lake is a human-made drainage reservoir dug in 1966 and the name of the surrounding &quot;village&quot; of neighborhoods located in Columbia, Maryland, just north and west of Columbia Town Center. The village was the first part of Columbia&#x27;s &quot;New Town&quot; to be built in the late 1960s, James W. Rouse and Frazar B. Wilde formally opened the neighborhood on June 21, 1967. The lake and village are named for Frazar B. Wilde, a past chairman of the board of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and former employer of James Rouse. In 1963, the company agreed to fund the secret land purchases and, in return, acquired an equity participation. This arrangement was subsequently formalized by the creation of The Howard Research and Development Corporation, the joint venture established to develop Columbia.

==Wilde Lake==
Wilde Lake collects storm water runoff from , with a maximum capacity of . Rouse executive Mort Hoppenfeld designed the tall, wide dam across the Patuxent River branch which flooded the fields between the historic stone buildings of Oakland Manor and the pre-colonial Old Oakland manor. The dam project was budgeted at $500,000 for construction, but came in at $900,000 by the time of construction. A rapid change in design by engineer George Levine reduced the cost to $250,000 In 1969, Spiro Agnew proclaimed the arrival of the first Columbia-based scientific firm, Hittman Associates, who relocated for favorable lease rates from Howard Research and Development. Hittman in turn was contracted by the EPA, recommending Wilde Lake reuse storm water runoff from the reservoir for Columbia resident&#x27;s drinking water to save on development costs.

==Neighborhoods==

Neighborhoods in the Village of Wilde Lake were built around the Oakland Manor, a former slave plantation. Some historical buildings were razed for the development, but other stone outbuildings dating to the 1700s still stand in the community. John E Slayton was hired to be the first manager of Columbia. He moved into a historic home with his wife Barbra becoming Columbia&#x27;s first resident and postmaster. Officials would not release the cause of the 37-year-old manager&#x27;s sudden death soon after in January 1967. Guards were stationed at the private access roads to the post office for safety reasons but were later ordered to allow the public access during its operating hours. Ten homebuilding contractors were chosen to build homes in the development. James P. Ryan left his family business Ryan Homes to form Ryland Homes with Columbia as its first client for pre-fabricated homes. Tom Harkins built the first three hundred apartment in Howard County. In June 1967, Rouse offered its first public tours of Columbia, allowing visitors to travel on marked paved streets or take guided minibus tours. Early citizens of the new Cove development fought Rouse land-clearing operations in 1969 and lost as Rouse Company representatives were appointed to the first Columbia Association positions. Over time, a new association seat opened for every 4000 residents. The various neighborhoods include: Columbia&#x27;s oldest apartments built in 1967, Bryant Woods (named for William Cullen Bryant); Faulkner Ridge (named for William Faulkner); Running Brook (where the streets are named for Robert Frost&#x27;s poems and Aesop&#x27;s Fables, e.g. The Birches).

==Redevelopment==
As the planned community of Columbia reached its design capacity and development opportunities lessened, its developer sought to increase the population density of existing land in order to make a profitable revitalization of Columbia&#x27;s aging infrastructure. Kimco Realty Corporation, the current owner of the village center, proposed a controversial redevelopment plan in 2008, that would have torn down buildings and built a large number of apartments in a mixed-use project. A Kimco executive declared that plan to be &quot;null and void&quot; at a June 1, 2009 meeting. The vice-president of Acquisitions and Development said: &quot;I have no idea what the concept is [now].&quot; In 2013, Kimco broke ground on a $17 million project, demolishing the community grocery store, and proposing 250 multi-story garage apartments and of office space. The project is the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) project the company has pursued. LEED features incorporated into the design include on-site storm water management, efficient lighting, native landscaping, and sustainable building materials. The redevelopment attracted David&#x27;s Natural Market, an organic and whole foods grocery market, to open a store inside the village center. In 2015, Wood Partners took over the project, renaming it to Alta Wilde Lake and developing 230 apartments at a cost of $45 million with a commercial component and projected 4% rent growth.

==Services==
The village center is located in the Wilde Lake Village Green, and has a small grocery store, various restaurants, and other retail establishments. The Wilde Lake Community Center, called Slayton House, was named for John Slayton, first manager of the Columbia Association.

The Wilde Lake Interfaith Center is located in the village center.

==Education==
Wilde Lake High School, alma mater of actor (and grandson of Columbia founder James W. Rouse) Edward Norton, is located in the Village of Wilde Lake. Wilde Lake High School was the first high school to open in Columbia in 1971. It was the &quot;first in the country to use individual study &#x27;learning activities packages&#x27; for self-paced learning.&quot;

The school has three stories with skylights, and open hallways that overlook a central hallway nicknamed &quot;Main Street.&quot; It is home to The Jim Rouse Theater, which houses performing arts performances for both the school&#x27;s programs and for organizations throughout Columbia. The school is well known for its performing arts program.

The original high school was demolished in 1994 and a new one constructed in time for the 1996–1997 academic year. The former design was oval and two stories, with a windowless doughnut layout with classroom clusters, and a media center located in the center and accessible from the second level.
Other schools in the Village of Wilde Lake include Bryant Woods, and Running Brook elementary schools, and Wilde Lake Middle School. Faulkner Ridge Elementary closed in 1983.

In 2017, Wilde Lake Middle School became the first net zero school in the state of Maryland. It features multiple solar panels and a geothermal field.

==Recreation==
The walking path around the lake is long.

<doc id="795923" wikidata="Q3247762" url="?curid=795923" title="Heart–lung transplant">
<text>A heart–lung transplant is a procedure carried out to replace both failing heart and lungs in a single operation. Due to a shortage of suitable donors and because both heart and lung have to be transplanted together, it is a rare procedure; only about a hundred such transplants are performed each year in the United States.

==Procedure==
The patient is anesthetised. When the donor organs arrive, they are checked for fitness; if any organs show signs of damage, they are discarded and the operation cancelled.

Once suitable donor organs are present, the surgeon makes an incision starting above and finishing below the sternum, cutting all the way to the bone. The skin edges are retracted to expose the sternum. Using a bone saw, the sternum is cut down the middle. Rib spreaders are inserted in the cut, and spread the ribs to give access to the heart and lungs of the patient.

The patient is connected to a heart–lung machine, which circulates and oxygenates blood. The surgeon removes the failing heart and lungs. Most surgeons endeavour to cut blood vessels as close as possible to the heart to leave room for trimming, especially if the donor heart is of a different size than the original organ.

The donor heart and lungs are positioned and sewn into place. As the donor organs warm up to body temperature, the lungs begin to inflate. The heart may fibrillate at first – this occurs because the cardiac muscle fibres are not contracting synchronously. Internal paddles can be used to apply a small electric shock to the heart to restore proper rhythm.

Once the donor organs are functioning normally, the heart–lung machine is withdrawn, and the chest is closed.

==Qualifying conditions==
Most candidates for heart–lung transplants have life-threatening damage to both their heart and lungs. In the US, most prospective candidates have between twelve and twenty-four months to live. At any one time, there are about 250 people registered for heart–lung transplantation at the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) in the US, of which around forty will die before a suitable donor is found.

Conditions which may necessitate a heart–lung transplant include:
* Congenital problems (defects present at birth) affecting the heart and lungs (48%);
* Pulmonary hypertension (20%);
* Cystic fibrosis (2%);
* A second transplant after the first transplant was rejected or failed to operate satisfactorily (4%).

Candidates for a heart–lung transplant are usually required to be:
* Under 55 years old;
* Have no other medical conditions (e.g. AIDS, Diabetes, Hepatitis);
* Mentally sound;
* Capable of following a post-operative regimen of exercise and immunosuppressant drugs.

==Post-operation==
Most patients spend several days in the intensive care unit after the operation. If there are no complications (e.g., infection, rejection), some are able to return home after just two weeks in hospital. Patients will be given anti-rejection drugs and antibiotics to prevent infection as the anti-rejection drugs weakens the immune system. A schedule of frequent follow up visits is necessary.

==Statistics==
The success rate of heart–lung transplants has improved significantly in recent years. The British National Health Service states that the survival rate is now around 85%, one year after the transplant was performed.

In 2004, there were only 39 heart–lung transplants performed in the entire United States and only 75 worldwide. By comparison, in that same year there were 2,016 heart and 1,173 lung transplants.

==History==
Norman Shumway laid the groundwork for heart lung transplant with his experiments into heart transplant at Stanford in the mid-1960s. Shumway conducted the first adult heart transplant in the US in 1968.

<text>Guillermo Prospero Trinidad Stadium (officially known as &quot;Estadio Guillermo Próspero Trinidad&quot; which is part of the &quot;Compleho Deportivo Guillermo Prospero Trinidad&quot;), is a multi-purpose stadium in Oranjestad, Aruba. It is Aruba&#x27;s national football stadium, named after Guillermo Trinidad, a politician from the same neighbourhood (Dakota).

==History==
===Opening stadium===
The Wilhelminastadion was opened on Saturday 12 April 1952, and named after Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who abdicated four years before the opening. The new stadium had 1200 seats, the rest of the spectators had to stand. The festivities included a parade, a demonstration of calisthenics by 800 school children, and a football match between Bubali and Jong Santa Cruz. Jani Brokke, Dutch Antilles football player at the 1952 Summer Olympics, took the athlete&#x27;s oath.

===Renovations===
The first renovation was completed in 1994, along with a small expansion. The complex was reopened and renamed after the neighbourhood Dakota&#x27;s local politician Guillermo Prospero Trinidad. In 2005 and 2006 some work was done on the grass and running track. The stadium had not been maintained for years when in 2018 the FIFA declared the stadium unfit for international footballgames. 

In July 2021 a renovation was announced and the Aruban parliament accorded an initial budget of 1.5 million florin. Part I of the renovation would be renewal of the artificial grass, locker rooms and stands. Part II would renew the lighting and the running track. The works should be ready in March 2022. FIFA offered assistance and a financial contribution if the stadium was upgraded to their international standards.

In March of 2023 the renovation works were started. The works should take 8 months and include a new roof, artificial grass pitch, LED-lighting and a new score system. The Aruban government&#x27;s budget was up to 3.5 Million Florin. A few months in the renovation, FIFA visited the build and concluded that their standards would be met and the works were on schedule. The A.V.B. received their contribution.

==Activities==
The stadium has a capacity of approximately 2,500 spectators. It hosts football matches and also track and field competitions. It also is used to hold concerts, carnaval and other festivities. Sinbad performed his HBO comedy special &quot;Nothin&#x27; but the Funk&quot; here in 1997.

The stadium housed the Aruban Olympic Committee (COA) until the organisation outgrew their quarters. In 2023 they moved to a new headquarters at the Vondellaan.

<text>Luciano Laurana (Lutiano Dellaurana, ) (c. 1420 – 1479) was a Dalmatian Italian architect and engineer from the historic Vrana settlement near the town of Zadar in Dalmatia, (today in Croatia, then part of the Republic of Venice) After education by his father Martin in Vrana settlement, he worked mostly in Italy during the late 15th century. He was principal designer of the Palazzo Ducale of Urbino and one of the main figures in 15th-century Italian architecture. He considerably influenced the development of Renaissance architecture. His projects were accompanied with notes in the Croatian glagolitic script, as witnessed by the famous Bernardo Baldi. He was a relative of the sculptor Francesco Laurana.

== Biography ==

Laurana was born in Vrana near Zadar in Dalmatia. Later in life, the Italians in Urbino called him &quot;Schiavone&quot;. Little is known about his early years. His father Martin was a stonecutter in Zadar, who worked together with the famous sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico on the Šibenik Cathedral (Cathedral of St. James).

Around 1465 he is known to have collaborated in Mantua with Leon Battista Alberti. From 1466 to 1472 he directed the works of the new palace commissioned by Federico III da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino. The exact attribution of the works is still disputed, as it is known that also Francesco di Giorgio had a role in the construction: the innovative façade, however, is traditionally recognized as Laurana&#x27;s. Laurana improved Italian Renaissance tradition by using a system of columns, pilasters, and arcades to produce elegant facades and spacious rooms. In the arcaded palace courtyard Laurana achieved a rhythmic lightness, amplitude, and sophistication far in advance of contemporary Florentine work.

Later he worked in Naples for the king Ferrante II of Naples. From 1472 he was in Pesaro, where he attended the construction of the Castle (&quot;Rocca&quot;) until his death, occurred in 1479. The famous anonymous picture &quot;La città ideale&quot;, housed in the Urbino National Gallery, has been attributed to him.

== Nationality == 

&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes Luciano Laurana as &quot;one of the main figures in 15th-century Italian architecture&quot;. &quot;The Architecture Book&quot;, &quot;The Architectural historian in America&quot;, and &quot;Enciclopedia Italiana&quot; identify Laurana as an &quot;Italian architect&quot;.

He is internationally known as an Italian artist, even if he is today considered by Croatians in the overviews of their art, with the name &quot;Lucijan Vranjanin&quot;.
