<text>A hydrogel is a biphasic material, a mixture of porous and permeable solids and at least 10% of water or other interstitial fluid. The solid phase is a water insoluble three dimensional network of polymers, having absorbed a large amount of water or biological fluids. Hydrogels have several applications, especially in the biomedical area, such as in hydrogel dressing. Many hydrogels are synthetic, but some are derived from natural materials. The term &quot;hydrogel&quot; was coined in 1894.

==Chemistry==
=== Classification ===
The crosslinks which bond the polymers of a hydrogel fall under two general categories: physical hydrogels and chemical hydrogels. Chemical hydrogels have covalent cross-linking bonds, whereas physical hydrogels have non-covalent bonds. Chemical hydrogels can result in strong reversible or irreversible gels due to the covalent bonding. Chemical hydrogels that contain reversible covalent cross-linking bonds, such as hydrogels of thiomers being cross-linked via disulfide bonds, are non-toxic and are used in numerous medicinal products. Physical hydrogels usually have high biocompatibility, are not toxic, and are also easily reversible by simply changing an external stimulus such as pH, ion concentration (alginate) or temperature (gelatine); they are also used for medical applications. Physical crosslinks consist of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and chain entanglements (among others). A hydrogel generated through the use of physical crosslinks is sometimes called a &#x27;reversible&#x27; hydrogel. Chemical crosslinks consist of covalent bonds between polymer strands. Hydrogels generated in this manner are sometimes called &#x27;permanent&#x27; hydrogels.

Hydrogels are prepared using a variety of polymeric materials, which can be divided broadly into two categories according to their origin: natural or synthetic polymers. Natural polymers for hydrogel preparation include hyaluronic acid, chitosan, heparin, alginate, gelatin and fibrin. Common synthetic polymers include polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, sodium polyacrylate, acrylate polymers and copolymers thereof. Whereas natural hydrogels are usually non-toxic, and often provide other advantages for medical use, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibiotic/antifungal effect and improve regeneration of nearby tissue, their stability and strength is usually much lower than synthetic hydrogels. There are also synthetic hydrogels that can be used for medical applications, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyacrylate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).

=== Preparation ===
There are two suggested mechanisms behind physical hydrogel formation, the first one being the gelation of nanofibrous peptide assemblies, usually observed for oligopeptide precursors. The precursors self-assemble into fibers, tapes, tubes, or ribbons that entangle to form non-covalent cross-links. The second mechanism involves non-covalent interactions of cross-linked domains that are separated by water-soluble linkers, and this is usually observed in longer multi-domain structures. Tuning of the supramolecular interactions to produce a self-supporting network that does not precipitate, and is also able to immobilize water which is vital for to gel formation. Most oligopeptide hydrogels have a β-sheet structure, and assemble to form fibers, although α-helical peptides have also been reported. The typical mechanism of gelation involves the oligopeptide precursors self-assemble into fibers that become elongated, and entangle to form cross-linked gels.

One notable method of initiating a polymerization reaction involves the use of light as a stimulus. In this method, photoinitiators, compounds that cleave from the absorption of photons, are added to the precursor solution which will become the hydrogel. When the precursor solution is exposed to a concentrated source of light, usually ultraviolet irradiation, the photoinitiators will cleave and form free radicals, which will begin a polymerization reaction that forms crosslinks between polymer strands. This reaction will cease if the light source is removed, allowing the amount of crosslinks formed in the hydrogel to be controlled. The properties of a hydrogel are highly dependent on the type and quantity of its crosslinks, making photopolymerization a popular choice for fine-tuning hydrogels. This technique has seen considerable use in cell and tissue engineering applications due to the ability to inject or mold a precursor solution loaded with cells into a wound site, then solidify it in situ.

Physically crosslinked hydrogels can be prepared by different methods depending on the nature of the crosslink involved. Polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels are usually produced by the freeze-thaw technique. In this, the solution is frozen for a few hours, then thawed at room temperature, and the cycle is repeated until a strong and stable hydrogel is formed. Alginate hydrogels are formed by ionic interactions between alginate and double-charged cations. A salt, usually calcium chloride, is dissolved into an aqueous sodium alginate solution, that causes the calcium ions to create ionic bonds between alginate chains. Gelatin hydrogels are formed by temperature change. A water solution of gelatin forms an hydrogel at temperatures below 37–35 °C, as Van der Waals interactions between collagen fibers become stronger than thermal molecular vibrations.

=== Peptide based hydrogels ===
Peptide based hydrogels possess exceptional biocompatibility and biodegradability qualities, giving rise to their wide use of applications, particularly in biomedicine; as such, their physical properties can be fine-tuned in order to maximise their use. Methods to do this are: modulation of the amino acid sequence, pH, chirality, and increasing the number of aromatic residues. The order of amino acids within the sequence is crucial for gelation, as has been shown many times. In one example, a short peptide sequence Fmoc-Phe-Gly readily formed a hydrogel, whereas Fmoc-Gly-Phe failed to do so as a result of the two adjacent aromatic moieties being moved, hindering the aromatic interactions. Altering the pH can also have similar effects, an example involved the use of the naphthalene (Nap) modified dipeptides Nap-Gly-Ala, and Nap- Ala-Gly, where a drop in pH induced gelation of the former, but led to crystallisation of the latter. A controlled pH decrease method using glucono-δ-lactone (GdL), where the GdL is hydrolysed to gluconic acid in water is a recent strategy that has been developed as a way to form homogeneous and reproducible hydrogels. The hydrolysis is slow, which allows for a uniform pH change, and thus resulting in reproducible homogenous gels. In addition to this, the desired pH can be achieved by altering the amount of GdL added. The use of GdL has been used various times for the hydrogelation of Fmoc and Nap-dipeptides. In another direction, Morris et al reported the use of GdL as a &#x27;molecular trigger&#x27; to predict and control the order of gelation. Chirality also plays an essential role in gel formation, and even changing the chirality of a single amino acid from its natural L-amino acid to its unnatural D-amino acid can significantly impact the gelation properties, with the natural forms not forming gels. Furthermore, aromatic interactions play a key role in hydrogel formation as a result of π- π stacking driving gelation, shown by many studies.

===Other===
Hydrogels also possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue due to their significant water content. As responsive &quot;smart materials&quot;, hydrogels can encapsulate chemical systems which upon stimulation by external factors such as a change of pH may cause specific compounds such as glucose to be liberated to the environment, in most cases by a gel–sol transition to the liquid state. Chemomechanical polymers are mostly also hydrogels, which upon stimulation change their volume and can serve as actuators or sensors.

==Mechanical properties==
Hydrogels have been investigated for diverse applications. By modifying the polymer concentration of a hydrogel (or conversely, the water concentration), the Young&#x27;s modulus, shear modulus, and storage modulus can vary from 10 Pa to 3 MPa, a range of about five orders of magnitude. A similar effect can be seen by altering the crosslinking concentration. This much variability of the mechanical stiffness is why hydrogels are so appealing for biomedical applications, where it is vital for implants to match the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissues. Characterizing the mechanical properties of hydrogels can be difficult especially due to the differences in mechanical behavior that hydrogels have in comparison to other traditional engineering materials. In addition to its rubber elasticity and viscoelasticity, hydrogels have an additional time dependent deformation mechanism which is dependent on fluid flow called poroelasticity. These properties are extremely important to consider while performing mechanical experiments. Some common mechanical testing experiments for hydrogels are tension, compression (confined or unconfined), indentation, shear rheometry or dynamic mechanical analysis.

Hydrogels have two main regimes of mechanical properties: rubber elasticity and viscoelasticity:

===Rubber elasticity===
In the unswollen state, hydrogels can be modelled as highly crosslinked chemical gels, in which the system can be described as one continuous polymer network. In this case:

formula_1

where &quot;G&quot; is the shear modulus, &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;T&quot; is temperature, &quot;Np&quot; is the number of polymer chains per unit volume, &quot;ρ&quot; is the density, &quot;R&quot; is the ideal gas constant, and formula_2 is the (number) average molecular weight between two adjacent cross-linking points. formula_2 can be calculated from the swell ratio, &quot;Q&quot;, which is relatively easy to test and measure.

For the swollen state, a perfect gel network can be modeled as:

formula_4

In a simple uniaxial extension or compression test, the true stress, formula_5, and engineering stress, formula_6, can be calculated as:

formula_7

formula_8

where formula_9 is the stretch.

===Viscoelasticity===
For hydrogels, their elasticity comes from the solid polymer matrix while the viscosity originates from the polymer network mobility and the water and other components that make up the aqueous phase. Viscoelastic properties of a hydrogel is highly dependent on the nature of the applied mechanical motion. Thus, the time dependence of these applied forces is extremely important for evaluating the viscoelasticity of the material.

Physical models for viscoelasticity attempt to capture the elastic and viscous material properties of a material. In an elastic material, the stress is proportional to the strain while in a viscous material, the stress is proportional to the strain rate. The Maxwell model is one developed mathematical model for linear viscoelastic response. In this model, viscoelasticity is modeled analogous to an electrical circuit with a Hookean spring, that represents the Young&#x27;s modulus, and a Newtonian dashpot that represents the viscosity. A material that exhibit properties described in this model is a Maxwell material. Another physical model used is called the Kelvin-Voigt Model and a material that follow this model is called a Kelvin–Voigt material. In order to describe the time-dependent creep and stress-relaxation behavior of hydrogel, a variety of physical lumped parameter models can be used. These modeling methods vary greatly and are extremely complex, so the empirical Prony Series description is commonly used to describe the viscoelastic behavior in hydrogels.

In order to measure the time-dependent viscoelastic behavior of polymers dynamic mechanical analysis is often performed. Typically, in these measurements the one side of the hydrogel is subjected to a sinusoidal load in shear mode while the applied stress is measured with a stress transducer and the change in sample length is measured with a strain transducer. One notation used to model the sinusoidal response to the periodic stress or strain is:
:formula_10
in which G&#x27; is the real (elastic or storage) modulus, G&quot; is the imaginary (viscous or loss) modulus.

===Poroelasticity===
Poroelasticity is a characteristic of materials related to the migration of solvent through a porous material and the concurrent deformation that occurs. Poroelasticity in hydrated materials such as hydrogels occurs due to friction between the polymer and water as the water moves through the porous matrix upon compression. This causes a decrease in water pressure, which adds additional stress upon compression. Similar to viscoelasticity, this behavior is time dependent, thus poroelasticity is dependent on compression rate: a hydrogel shows softness upon slow compression, but fast compression makes the hydrogel stiffer. This phenomenon is due to the friction between the water and the porous matrix is proportional to the flow of water, which in turn is dependent on compression rate. Thus, a common way to measure poroelasticity is to do compression tests at varying compression rates. Pore size is an important factor in influencing poroelasticity. The Kozeny–Carman equation has been used to predict pore size by relating the pressure drop to the difference in stress between two compression rates.

Poroelasticity is described by several coupled equations, thus there are few mechanical tests that relate directly to the poroelastic behavior of the material, thus more complicated tests such as indentation testing, numerical or computational models are utilized. Numerical or computational methods attempt to simulate the three dimensional permeability of the hydrogel network.

=== Toughness and hysteresis ===
The toughness of a hydrogel refers to the ability of the hydrogel to withstand deformation or mechanical stress without fracturing or breaking apart. A hydrogel with high toughness can maintain its structural integrity and functionality under higher stress. Several factors contribute to the toughness of a hydrogel including composition, crosslink density, polymer chain structure, and hydration level. The toughness of a hydrogel is highly dependent on what polymer(s) and crosslinker(s) make up its matrix as certain polymers possess higher toughness and certain crosslinking covalent bonds are inherently stronger. Additionally, higher crosslinking density generally leads to increased toughness by restricting polymer chain mobility and enhancing resistance to deformation. The structure of the polymer chains is also a factor in that, longer chain lengths and higher molecular weight leads to a greater number of entanglements and higher toughness. A good balance (equilibrium) in the hydration of a hydrogel leads is important because too low hydration causes poor flexibility and toughness within the hydrogel, but too high of water content can cause excessive swelling, weakening the mechanical properties of the hydrogel.

The hysteresis of a hydrogel refers to the phenomenon where there is a delay in the deformation and recovery of a hydrogel when it is subjected to mechanical stress and relieved of that stress. This occurs because the polymer chains within a hydrogel rearrange, and the water molecules are displaced, and energy is stored as it deforms in mechanical extension or compression. When the mechanical stress is removed, the hydrogel begins to recover its original shape, but there may be a delay in the recovery process due to factors like viscoelasticity, internal friction, etc. This leads to a difference between the stress-strain curve during loading and unloading. Hysteresis within a hydrogel is influenced by several factors including composition, crosslink density, polymer chain structure, and temperature.

The toughness and hysteresis of a hydrogel are especially important in the context of biomedical applications such as tissue engineering and drug delivery, as the hydrogel may need to withstand mechanical forces within the body, but also maintain mechanical performance and stability over time. Most typical hydrogels, both natural and synthetic, have a positive correlation between toughness and hysteresis, meaning that the higher the toughness, the longer the hydrogel takes to recover its original shape and vice versa. This is largely due to sacrificial bonds being the source of toughness within many of these hydrogels. Sacrificial bonds are non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions, that can break and reform under mechanical stress. The reforming of these bonds takes time, especially when there are more of them, which leads to an increase in hysteresis. However, there is currently research focused on the development of highly entangled hydrogels, which instead rely on the long chain length of the polymers and their entanglement to limit the deformation of the hydrogel, thereby increasing the toughness without increasing hysteresis as there is no need for the reformation of the bonds.

===Environmental response===
The most commonly seen environmental sensitivity in hydrogels is a response to temperature. Many polymers/hydrogels exhibit a temperature dependent phase transition, which can be classified as either an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) or lower critical solution temperature (LCST). UCST polymers increase in their water-solubility at higher temperatures, which lead to UCST hydrogels transitioning from a gel (solid) to a solution (liquid) as the temperature is increased (similar to the melting point behavior of pure materials). This phenomenon also causes UCST hydrogels to expand (increase their swell ratio) as temperature increases while they are below their UCST. However, polymers with LCSTs display an inverse (or negative) temperature-dependence, where their water-solubility decreases at higher temperatures. LCST hydrogels transition from a liquid solution to a solid gel as the temperature is increased, and they also shrink (decrease their swell ratio) as the temperature increases while they are above their LCST.

Applications can dictate for diverse thermal responses. For example, in the biomedical field, LCST hydrogels are being investigated as drug delivery systems due to being injectable (liquid) at room temp and then solidifying into a rigid gel upon exposure to the higher temperatures of the human body. There are many other stimuli that hydrogels can be responsive to, including: pH, glucose, electrical signals, light, pressure, ions, antigens, and more.

===Additives===
The mechanical properties of hydrogels can be fine-tuned in many ways beginning with attention to their hydrophobic properties. Another method of modifying the strength or elasticity of hydrogels is to graft or surface coat them onto a stronger/stiffer support, or by making superporous hydrogel (SPH) composites, in which a cross-linkable matrix swelling additive is added. Other additives, such as nanoparticles and microparticles, have been shown to significantly modify the stiffness and gelation temperature of certain hydrogels used in biomedical applications.

===Processing techniques===
While a hydrogel&#x27;s mechanical properties can be tuned and modified through crosslink concentration and additives, these properties can also be enhanced or optimized for various applications through specific processing techniques. These techniques include electro-spinning, 3D/4D printing, self-assembly, and freeze-casting. One unique processing technique is through the formation of multi-layered hydrogels to create a spatially-varying matrix composition and by extension, mechanical properties. This can be done by polymerizing the hydrogel matrixes in a layer by layer fashion via UV polymerization. This technique can be useful in creating hydrogels that mimic articular cartilage, enabling a material with three separate zones of distinct mechanical properties.

Another emerging technique to optimize hydrogel mechanical properties is by taking advantage of the Hofmeister series. Due to this phenomenon, through the addition of salt solution, the polymer chains of a hydrogel aggregate and crystallize, which increases the toughness of the hydrogel. This method, called &quot;salting out&quot;, has been applied to poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels by adding a sodium sulfate salt solution. Some of these processing techniques can be used synergistically with each other to yield optimal mechanical properties. Directional freezing or freeze-casting is another method in which a directional temperature gradient is applied to the hydrogel is another way to form materials with anisotropic mechanical properties. Utilizing both the freeze-casting and salting-out processing techniques on poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels to induce hierarchical morphologies and anisotropic mechanical properties. Directional freezing of the hydrogels helps to align and coalesce the polymer chains, creating anisotropic array honeycomb tube-like structures while salting out the hydrogel yielded out a nano-fibril network on the surface of these honeycomb tube-like structures. While maintaining a water content of over 70%, these hydrogels&#x27; toughness values are well above those of water-free polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), Kevlar, and synthetic rubber. The values also surpass the toughness of natural tendon and spider silk.

=== Biomaterials ===
Implanted or injected hydrogels have the potential to support tissue regeneration by mechanical tissue support, localized drug or cell delivery, local cell recruitement or immunomodulation, or encapsulation of nanoparticles for local photothermal therapy or brachytherapy. Polymeric drug delivery systems have overcome challenges due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and anti-toxicity. Materials such as collagen, chitosan, cellulose, and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) have been implemented extensively for drug delivery to organs such as eye, nose, kidneys, lungs, intestines, skin and brain. Future work is focused on reducing toxicity, improving biocompatibility, expanding assembly techniques

Hydrogels have been considered as vehicles for drug delivery. They can also be made to mimic animal mucosal tissues to be used for testing mucoadhesive properties. They have been examined for use as reservoirs in topical drug delivery; particularly ionic drugs, delivered by iontophoresis.

<doc id="844291" wikidata="Q123265" url="?curid=844291" title="Billy Meier">
<text>Eduard Albert Meier (born 3 February 1937), commonly nicknamed &quot;Billy&quot;, is the founder of a UFO religion called the &quot;Freie Interessengemeinschaft für Grenz- und Geisteswissenschaften und Ufologiestudien&quot; (Free Community of Interests for the Border and Spiritual Sciences and Ufological Studies) and alleged contactee whose UFO photographs are claimed to show alien spacecraft. Meier claims to be in regular contact with extraterrestrial beings he calls the Plejaren. He also presented other material during the 1970s such as metal samples, sound recordings and film footage. Meier claims to be the seventh reincarnation after six prophets common to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: Enoch, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Immanuel (Jesus), and Muhammad.

Meier has been widely characterized as a fraud by skeptics and ufologists, who suggest that he used models to hoax photos claimed to show alien spacecraft. Meier&#x27;s prophecies repeatedly blame Jews (whom he refers to as &quot;gypsies&quot;) for future atrocities.

== Background ==
Meier was born in the town of Bülach in the Zürcher Unterland. Meier left public schools before finishing 6th grade. In his teens he was convicted multiple times of minor offenses. In 1953, he was convicted of thievery and forgery and sentenced to a prison term in Rheinau. After escaping from the facility, Meier illegally crossed the border and joined the French Foreign Legion. He went AWOL from the Legion to return home. In 1965, he lost his left arm in a bus accident in Turkey. Some time later, he met and married a Greek woman, Kalliope Zafiriou, with whom he had three children. The nickname &quot;Billy&quot; came by way of an American friend who thought Meier&#x27;s cowboy style of dress reminded her of Billy the Kid.

== Alleged extraterrestrial contacts ==
Meier claims his extraterrestrial encounters began in 1942, at the age of five, when he met an elderly Plejaren man named &quot;Sfath&quot;. After Sfath&#x27;s death in 1953, Meier said, he began communicating with an extraterrestrial woman (though not a Plejaren) called &quot;Asket&quot;. All contacts ceased in 1964, he said, then resumed on January 28, 1975, when he met &quot;Semjase&quot;, the granddaughter of Sfath, and shortly thereafter another Plejaren man called &quot;Ptaah&quot;. Other extraterrestrials have since allegedly joined the dialog as well.

Meier founded a non-profit organization based on his alleged contacts with Semjase, called the &quot;Freie Interessengemeinschaft für Grenz- und Geisteswissenschaften und Ufologiestudien&quot; (Free Community of Interests for the Border and Spiritual Sciences and Ufological Studies) in the late 1970s and established his &quot;Semjase Silver Star Center&quot;. The organization&#x27;s headquarters is in Switzerland.

== Photographs, films ==

Meier&#x27;s photographs and films are claimed by him to show alien spacecraft floating above the Swiss countryside. He calls the alleged spaceships &quot;beamships&quot; from Plejaren. According to Meier, the Plejaren gave him permission to photograph and film their beamships so that he could produce evidence of their extraterrestrial visitations. Some of Meier&#x27;s photos are claimed by him to show prehistoric Earth scenes, extraterrestrials, and celestial objects from an alleged non-Earthly vantage point. Meier&#x27;s claims are widely characterized as fraudulent by scientists, skeptics, and most ufologists, who say that his photographs and films are hoaxes. In interviews with author Gary Kinder, Meier admitted to using models to recreate scenes after his wife showed photos of incomplete models he thought he had destroyed by burning. During a 2017 art exhibit about conspiracies, many of Meier&#x27;s photographs were shown. Photography curator Gordon MacDonald commented on examinations from the 1970s that the photos weren&#x27;t doctored saying &quot;Just because photographs are real – ie real images made with a real camera – doesn&#x27;t mean they are of what the person says they&#x27;re of.&quot;

In 1997, Meier&#x27;s ex-wife, Kalliope, told interviewers that his photos were of spaceship models he crafted with items like trash can lids, carpet tacks and other household objects, and that the stories he told of his adventures with the aliens were similarly fictitious. She also said that photos of purported extraterrestrial women &quot;Asket&quot; and &quot;Nera&quot; were really photos of Michelle DellaFave and Susan Lund, members of the singing and dancing troupe The Golddiggers. It was later confirmed that the women in the photographs were members of The Golddiggers performing on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;.

== Media ==
Billy Meier&#x27;s story is documented in &quot;Contact&quot;, written and directed by Larry Savadove in 1987.  The film is narrated by David Warner, featuring UFO researchers Lee Elders and Wendelle Stevens.

<doc id="844292" wikidata="Q621673" url="?curid=844292" title="Search tree">
<text>In computer science, a search tree is a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. In order for a tree to function as a search tree, the key for each node must be greater than any keys in subtrees on the left, and less than any keys in subtrees on the right.

The advantage of search trees is their efficient search time given the tree is reasonably balanced, which is to say the leaves at either end are of comparable depths. Various search-tree data structures exist, several of which also allow efficient insertion and deletion of elements, which operations then have to maintain tree balance.

Search trees are often used to implement an associative array. The search tree algorithm uses the key from the key–value pair to find a location, and then the application stores the entire key–value pair at that particular location.

==Types of trees==
===Binary search tree===

A Binary Search Tree is a node-based data structure where each node contains a key and two subtrees, the left and right. For all nodes, the left subtree&#x27;s key must be less than the node&#x27;s key, and the right subtree&#x27;s key must be greater than the node&#x27;s key. These subtrees must all qualify as binary search trees.

The worst-case time complexity for searching a binary search tree is the height of the tree, which can be as small as O(log n) for a tree with n elements.

===B-tree===

B-trees are generalizations of binary search trees in that they can have a variable number of subtrees at each node. While child-nodes have a pre-defined range, they will not necessarily be filled with data, meaning B-trees can potentially waste some space. The advantage is that B-trees do not need to be re-balanced as frequently as other self-balancing trees.

Due to the variable range of their node length, B-trees are optimized for systems that read large blocks of data, they are also commonly used in databases.

The time complexity for searching a B-tree is O(log n).

===(a,b)-tree===

An (a,b)-tree is a search tree where all of its leaves are the same depth. Each node has at least a children and at most b children, while the root has at least 2 children and at most b children.

a and b can be decided with the following formula:

formula_1

The time complexity for searching an (a,b)-tree is O(log n).

===Ternary search tree===

A ternary search tree is a type of tree that can have 3 nodes: a low child, an equal child, and a high child. Each node stores a single character and the tree itself is ordered the same way a binary search tree is, with the exception of a possible third node.

Searching a ternary search tree involves passing in a string to test whether any path contains it.

The time complexity for searching a balanced ternary search tree is O(log n).

==Searching algorithms==

===Searching for a specific key===
Assuming the tree is ordered, we can take a key and attempt to locate it within the tree. The following algorithms are generalized for binary search trees, but the same idea can be applied to trees of other formats.

====Recursive====
 search-recursive(key, node)
 if node is &quot;NULL&quot;
 return &quot;EMPTY_TREE&quot;
 if key &lt; node.key
 return search-recursive(key, node.left)
 else if key &gt; node.key
 return search-recursive(key, node.right)
 else
 return node

====Iterative====
 searchIterative(key, node)
 currentNode := node
 while currentNode is not &quot;NULL&quot;
 if currentNode.key = key
 return currentNode
 else if currentNode.key &gt; key
 currentNode := currentNode.left
 else
 currentNode := currentNode.right

===Searching for min and max===
In a sorted tree, the minimum is located at the node farthest left, while the maximum is located at the node farthest right.

====Minimum====
 findMinimum(node)
 if node is &quot;NULL&quot;
 return &quot;EMPTY_TREE&quot;
 min := node
 while min.left is not &quot;NULL&quot;
 min := min.left
 return min.key

====Maximum====
 findMaximum(node)
 if node is &quot;NULL&quot;
 return &quot;EMPTY_TREE&quot;
 max := node
 while max.right is not &quot;NULL&quot;
 max := max.right
 return max.key

<text>Luigi Carlo Filippo Russolo (30 April 1885 – 4 February 1947) was an Italian Futurist painter, composer, builder of experimental musical instruments, and the author of the manifesto &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; (1913). Russolo completed his secondary education at Seminary of Portograuro in 1901, after which he moved to Milan and began gaining interest in the arts. He is often regarded as one of the first noise music experimental composers with his performances of &quot;noise music concerts&quot; in 1913–14 and then again after World War I, notably in Paris in 1921. He designed and constructed a number of noise-generating devices called Intonarumori.

==Biography==
Luigi Russolo was perhaps the first noise artist. His 1913 manifesto, &quot;L&#x27;Arte dei Rumori (The Art of Noises)&quot;, stated that the industrial revolution had given modern men a greater capacity to appreciate more complex sounds. Russolo found traditional melodic music confining, and he envisioned noise music as its future replacement.

Russolo designed and constructed a number of noise-generating devices called Intonarumori, and assembled a noise orchestra to perform with them. A performance of his &quot;Gran Concerto Futuristico&quot; (1917) was met with strong disapproval and violence from the audience, as Russolo himself had predicted.

None of his intoning instruments have survived: some were destroyed in World War II; while others have been lost. Replicas of the instruments have since been built and performed. (See the Intonarumori page.)

Although Russolo&#x27;s works bear little resemblance to modern noise music, his pioneering creations cannot be overlooked as an essential stage in the evolution of the several genres in this category. Many artists are now familiar with Russolo&#x27;s manifesto.

== Connections to Fascism ==
Russolo, like many other Futurist artists, is often associated with Italian fascism. In addition to his association with the Futurist artist and poet F. T. Marinetti, who co-authored the Fascist Manifesto (1919), Russolo presented his work at exhibitions sponsored by Mussolini&#x27;s government. His biographer Luciano Chessa argues that some have attempted to erase Russolo&#x27;s involvement with fascism from scholarship, but that his permanent return to Italy in 1933 and subsequent writings signaled acceptance of and allegiance to Mussolini&#x27;s regime. 

==Collaboration with Antonio Russolo==
Antonio Russolo, another Italian Futurist composer and Luigi&#x27;s brother, produced a recording of two works featuring the original Intonarumori. The phonograph recording, made in 1921, included works entitled &quot;Corale&quot; and &quot;Serenata&quot;, which combined conventional orchestral music set against the sound of the noise machines. It is the only surviving contemporaneous sound recording of Luigi Russolo&#x27;s noise music. Russolo and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti gave the first concert of Futurist music, complete with &quot;intonarumori&quot;, in April 1914, causing a riot. The program comprised four &quot;Noise Networks&quot;.

<text>Flanders is both a cultural community and an economic region within the Belgian state, and has significant autonomy.

Historically, the contemporary Flemish community (or nation, as some Flemings see it) grew out of the Catholic southern part of the medieval XVII provinces of the Low Countries. The contemporary Belgian Flanders area was divided within several feudal states. The most important states were the County of Flanders (except for its southernmost areas), the southern part of the Duchy of Brabant (except for the area around Nivelles) and the northern part of the Bishopric of Liège. Most of these states were united from 1384 to 1530 under the Burgundian Netherlands

Today, the Flemish community has a significant amount of political autonomy. Its institutions include the Flemish Parliament and a Flemish Government, both institutions of the region and community, with legislative powers for most matters and prescribed by the Belgian constitution. Residual powers rest with the federal layer, the Belgian Parliament and Government, or on the European layer (European Union).

Since 25 July 2014, the Minister-President of Flanders has been Geert Bourgeois (N-VA), leading a coalition government of N-VA, CD&amp;V, and Open VLD.

==Political system==
Flanders is a part of the Belgian federal parliamentary representative democratic monarchy, which itself is part of the European Union. The political system in Flanders has an executive branch, the Flemish Government and a representative branch, the Flemish Parliament. The Minister-President of Flanders is the head of government. Flanders has a rather fragmented pluriform multi-party system. Politics is influenced by lobby groups, such as trade unions; mutual health insurance organizations and business interests in the form of the VOKA, UNIZO and some other employer&#x27;s federations.

===Institutional framework===
European Union legislation and the Belgian constitution form the major elements of the wider institutional environment. European Union legislation is said to currently define the scope and limits for 70% of new legislation. The Belgian constitution establishes the framework for the autonomy in both community and regional affairs. The two relevant Flemish parliamentary assemblies then immediately decided that the Flemish Community was to absorb all the competencies of the Flemish Region. Since then, the region has no &#x27;distinctive&#x27; parliament, nor government. European Union law, Flemish legislation and the Belgian constitution thus form the primary source of law and the basis of the political system in Flanders.

===Flemish Government===
The executive branch of government consists of a limited number of ministers drawn from the political parties which, in practice, form the government coalition. The ministers are appointed by the Flemish Parliament. The Cabinet is chaired by the Flemish Minister-President. Ministers head executive departments of the government. Ministers must defend their policies and performance, in person, before the Chamber. The Flemish Government must receive and keep the confidence of the Flemish Parliament.

===Provincial and local government===
Flanders is divided into 5 provinces, plus the local Flemish institutions in Brussels (the &#x27;Vlaamse Gemeenschaps-Commissie&#x27; (VGC), and around 300 municipalities. Provincial and local government are an exclusive competency of the regions. The provincial governments are primarily administrative units, and are politically weak. A governor is appointed by Flemish government, and approved by the Flemish parliament. One governor presides over each province. The governor is supported by an elected Provincial Council of 47 to 84 members.

Municipal governments, on the other hand, are important political entities with significant powers, and a history of independence dating from medieval times. Many national politicians have a political base in a municipality, often doubling as mayor or alderman in their own hometowns.

===Electoral system===
Several months before an election, each party forms a list of candidates for each district. Parties are allowed to place as many candidates on their &quot;ticket&quot; as there are seats available. The formation of the list is an internal process that varies with each party. The place on the list influences the election of a candidate, but its influence has diminished since the last electoral reform. Individual votes will get priority.

Political campaigns are relatively short, and there are restrictions on the use of billboards. For all of their activities, campaigns included, political parties have to rely on government subsidies and dues paid by their members. An &#x27;electoral expenditure&#x27; law restricts expenditure of political parties during an electoral campaign. Because of the huge public bureaucracy, the high politicisation of nominations, and the widely accepted practice that political nominees spend many man-hours paid for by all tax-payers for partisan electioneering, this arrangement favours the ruling political parties. Since no single party holds an absolute majority, the strongest party or party family will usually create a coalition with other parties to form the government.

Voting is compulsory; more than 90% of the population participates. Elections for the Flemish Parliament are normally held every five years. The elections coincide with those for the European Parliament. Elections for municipal and provincial councils are held every six years. The next federal election will be held in 2024, the next community and regional elections are expected in 2024 as well and the next municipal and provincial elections in 2024.

==Political parties in Flanders==
Flemish political parties are many and varied. They operate in the Flemish region and in the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region. Francophone parties operate in Flemish Region only in a few areas bordering the latter. There are no major representative parties operating all over Belgium. Flemish politics is dominated by political parties representing the different ideologies that can be found everywhere in Flanders. There are no political parties specific for certain sub-regions.

From the creation of the Belgian state in 1830, and throughout most of the 19th century, two unified political parties dominated Belgian politics: the Catholic Party (Church-oriented and conservative) and the Liberal Party (anti-clerical and progressive). In the late 19th century the Socialist Party arose to represent the emerging industrial working class.

These three groups still dominate Belgian politics, but they have evolved substantially in character. In addition, several other parties were founded, notably the Vlaams Belang, a right wing, anti-immigration and Flemish-nationalistic party and currently the second most important party in Flanders, Volksunie, which split into the left-liberal SPIRIT and the right-conservative N-VA, for moderate Flemish nationalists, and Agalev, currently called Groen! for the Greens.

===Catholics/Christian Democrats===
After World War II, the Catholic (now Christian Democratic) Party severed its formal ties with the Church. It became a mass party of the centre.

In 1968, the Christian Democratic Party, responding to linguistic tensions in the country, divided into two independent parties: the &quot;Parti Social Chrétien&quot; (PSC) in French-speaking Belgium and the &quot;Christelijke Volkspartij&quot; (CVP) in Flanders. The two parties pursue the same basic policies but have wholly separate organizations.

The CVP is the larger of the two, getting more than twice as many votes as the PSC. Following the 1999 general elections, the CVP was ousted from office, bringing an end to a 40-year term on the government benches. In 2001, the CVP changed its name to CD&amp;V (&quot;Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams&quot;). The current chairman of the CD&amp;V is Sammy Mahdi.

===Socialists/Social Democrats===
The Socialist Party – Differently (SP.a, &quot;Socialistische Partij Anders&quot;) has shed nearly all of its early Marxist ideology. It is now primarily a social-democratic party, similar to labor-based parties like the German Social Democratic Party. The Socialists have been part of several postwar governments.

It was formerly known as the &quot;Socialistische Partij&quot; (SP), which in turn had branched off from the &quot;Belgische Socialistische Partij&quot; (BSP), formed by former members of the &quot;Belgische Werklieden Partij&quot; (BWP). The Socialists split along linguistic lines in 1978. The Flemish Socialists changed their party&#x27;s name to SP.a (&quot;Socialistische Partij Anders&quot;) in 2002. Bruno Tobback is the current head of the Flemish Socialist Party.

As a reaction to the more centrist course of the SP.a, two former SP.a-representatives, Jef Sleeckx and Lode Van Outrive, formed, together with communist and Trotskyist activists, a new socialist movement in 2006, the Committee for Another Policy.

===Liberals/Liberal Democrats===
The Liberal Party chiefly appeals to business-people, property owners, shopkeepers, and the self-employed, in general. In American terms the Liberals&#x27; economic positions would be considered to reflect a moderate conservative ideology.

The Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (OpenVLD, &quot;Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten&quot;), who opened up their ranks to &quot;Volksunie&quot; defectors some years ago, were the largest political force in Flanders during the 1990s, but lost more than one third of their support after 7 years of liberal control of the post of prime minister by Guy Verhofstadt. The Open VLD is currently headed by Alexander De Croo.

Over the last decade, a number of parties originated, as break away parties from the VLD. These were &quot;Liberaal Appèl&quot;, founded by Ward Beysen, VLOTT, founded by Hugo Coveliers and &quot;Lijst Dedecker&quot;, founded by Jean-Marie Dedecker. These parties advocated classical liberal economics and a more rightwing approach to society, and accused the VLD of shifting fundamentally to the left.

===Communists===
The &quot;Kommunistische Partij&quot; (KP) is the successor in Flanders of the &quot;Kommunistische Partij van België&quot; (KPB), the first communist party in Belgium. This party was founded in 1921, but disappeared from the Belgian Parliament after the elections of 1985.

The most successful Maoist movement to emerge in Flanders was &quot;Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders&quot; (AMADA - All Power To The Workers) at the end of the 1960s during a time of students protests at the University of Leuven. In 1979 this movement evolved into the &quot;Partij van de Arbeid van België&quot; (PVDA), which is at the moment the biggest marxist party in Flanders (3,24% of the popular vote in the latest federal elections) and is represented in some municipal and provincial councils in Flanders, but not in the Flemish Parliament. Through the French-speaking electoral college, the party is represented in the Federal Parliament.

Other minor communist parties are the Trotskyist &quot;Socialistische Arbeiderspartij&quot; (SAP) and the &quot;Linkse Socialistische Partij&quot; (LSP).

===Linguistic parties===
A specific phenomenon was the emergence of one-issue parties whose only reason for existence was the defense of the cultural, political, and economic interests of one of the linguistic groups or regions of Belgian society. See Flemish movement.

The most militant Flemish regional party in Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s, the &quot;Volksunie&quot; (People&#x27;s Union), once drew nearly one-quarter of Belgium&#x27;s Dutch-speaking electorate. It was in the forefront of a successful campaign by the country&#x27;s Flemish population for cultural and political parity with the nation&#x27;s long dominant French-speaking population. However, in recent elections the party has suffered severe setbacks. In October 2001 the party disintegrated. The left-liberal wing founded &quot;Spirit&quot;, later called the Social Liberal Party, while the more traditional Flemish nationalist wing continued under the banner &quot;Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie&quot; (N-VA). After a disappointing result in the regional elections of 2009, the Social Liberal Party decided to fuse with the Flemish ecologists of &quot;Groen!&quot;

The &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; was another party created out of the Volksunie in 1978. In 2004 it disbanded and reformed as &quot;Vlaams Belang&quot; after a conviction for violating the Anti-Racism Law. It strongly advocated Flemish independence and the cultural assimilation of migrants. (see Nationalists/Conservatives below)

===Ecologists/Greens===
The Flemish ecologist party &quot;Agalev&quot; (Anders GAan LEVen - To Start Living Differently) made its parliamentary breakthrough in 1981. As a traditional green party, the three core values of Agalev were ecology, peace and participatory democracy. Following significant gains made in the 1999 general elections, the green parties of both regions joined a federal coalition cabinet for the first time in their history, but were ousted after the next elections. Agalev subsequently changed its name to &quot;Groen!&quot; (Green!).

===Nationalists/Conservatives===
Another nationalist party is the rightwing nationalist &quot;Vlaams Belang&quot; (Flemish Interest), the successor of the &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; (Flemish Block) which broke away from the Volksunie in 1976. Originally a mainly Flemish regionalist and republican party, the Vlaams Blok soon concentrated on anti-immigration themes, and was often accused of xenophobia and racism. Its viewpoints on ethical and moral issues is very conservative. Party chairperson was MEP Frank Vanhecke, but Filip Dewinter is considered by many to have been the party&#x27;s real leader. Long dismissed as a &quot;fringe&quot; party by mainstream politicians, the Flemish Block shocked observers when in the 1991 elections it posted a relatively high percentage of votes in much of Flanders, especially in Antwerp. The party scored even better in later local, regional and federal elections and still seemed to be winning support in November 2006, but the party lost a seat in the federal elections in 2007.

The &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; was found to be operating contrary to the Belgian constitution for racism. In 2004, the Belgian Supreme Court upheld a decision of the Appeal Court of Ghent ruling that three organizations associated with the Vlaams Blok were in contempt of the 1981 Belgian law on racism and xenophobia, and that the party pursued permanent incitement to discrimination and racial segregation. The party was denied state funding and was therefore disbanded. &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; supporters saw the conviction as a politically motivated action, and point out that the constitution had to be changed to allow for the conviction. A new party (basically the same in organization, membership, initials, and party programme, excluding anything that could be seen as racist) was founded and labelled &quot;Vlaams Belang&quot; (Flemish Interest).

===Linguistic minority===
The &quot;Union des Francophones&quot; () or UF is a Belgian electoral list which participates in regional, provincial and municipal elections in the province of Flemish Brabant. As the name suggests, its primary target are the French-speaking inhabitants of Flemish Brabant and particularly those who live in Halle-Vilvoorde and the predominantly French-speaking municipalities with linguistic facilities near the Brussels-Capital Region. The UF is a cooperation between the three most important French-speaking parties in Belgium: the Mouvement Réformateur, the Centre Démocrate Humaniste and the Parti Socialiste. The coalition wants an enlargement of the bilingual Brussels Capital Region through the merger of various municipalities with linguistic facilities with a large percentage of French-speakers, like Sint-Genesius-Rode, and opposes the splitting of the bilingual Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde electoral and judicial constituency.

The party currently has one representative in the Flemish Parliament, six in the provincial council of Flemish Brabant and dozens in several municipal councils.

==Alliances==
After the installation of a 5% electoral threshold, with private funding close to forbidden and public funding practically impossible (only for parties with at least one representative in parliament), some of the smaller parties have made alliances with a larger, more traditional party, especially in the Flemish Region. Parties in any alliance remain independent, but they would field candidates on one combined list at elections.
In general, the smaller party/parties would be assured of gaining seats, and the larger party would be assured of obtaining a larger overall share of the vote. This was especially true for the CD&amp;V / N-VA alliance, whereby CD&amp;V became the largest party by votes in the Flemish regional elections, so therefore it could initiate coalition talks and the party could appoint the leader of the Flemish regional government.

The VLD / Vivant / Liberaal Appel alliance did not perform well in the polls. The alliance was renamed Open VLD as of February 2007. The proposed SP.a / Spirit / Groen! alliance did not happen, instead the SP.a / Spirit alliance went alone to the polls. Vlaams Belang formed an alliance with VLOTT, a break away party from the VLD, which advocates capitalist and rightwing liberal economic policies. The VB / VLOTT alliance is negotiating with Lijst Dedecker to include them in the alliance, but the outcome is in the balance and is unlikely to happen.

<text>Robert Daniel Nault (born November 9, 1955) is a Canadian politician.

A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, Nault began his career as city councillor for Kenora City Council. He was first elected to the House of Commons as the representative for Kenora—Rainy River in 1988, beating NDP incumbent John Parry. Following the 1988 election, Nault ran successfully in the 1993,1997, and 2000 federal elections.

Nault also served as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in the cabinet of Jean Chrétien from 1999 to 2003. While in cabinet, he introduced the &quot;First Nations Governance Act&quot;, a program of reform and financial accountability measures for First Nations.

In February 2004, he announced he would leave politics to set up a consulting business, Western Frontier International Group. He did not seek re-election in the 2004 election.

In January 2015, Nault announced his intention to seek the Liberal Party of Canada nomination for Kenora, which includes nearly all of his old riding, in the 2015 federal election scheduled for October 19. On May 31, 2015, Nault was nominated as the party&#x27;s candidate. In the ensuing election, he edged out former provincial NDP leader Howard Hampton, who had represented the area provincially from 1987 to 2011, by only 2% to return to Parliament after a 12-year absence. Incumbent Conservative and cabinet minister Greg Rickford was pushed into third place.

In February 2016, Nault was elected Chair by committee members of the Foreign Affairs and International Development Committee.

He was defeated in the 2019 federal election.

<text>Lester Allan Pelton (September 5, 1829 – March 14, 1908) was an American inventor who contributed significantly to the development of hydroelectricity and hydropower in the American Old West as well as world-wide. In the late 1870s, he invented the &quot;Pelton water wheel&quot;, at that time the most efficient design of the impulse water turbine. Recognized as one of the fathers of hydroelectric power, he was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal during his lifetime and is an inductee of the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Lester A. Pelton was born in a log-cabin in rural Vermilion Twp., Erie County, Ohio. His grandfather, Captain Josiah Pelton, who lost most of his assets as a sea-captain during the War-of-1812 era, shortly later brought his family to Ohio. Lester&#x27;s father was Allen Pelton, and his mother was Fanny Cuddeback, from another local early pioneer family. As a youngster, Lester worked on his family&#x27;s farm and probably attended the nearby &quot;Cuddeback&quot; grade-school.

In 1850, young Pelton, along with several other local males, emigrated from Ohio to participate in the California gold rush. He was not successful as a gold-miner, but he fished the Sacramento River and sold his catch locally; and he worked in wood-milling and carpentry. In 1860, after the gold strikes in the nearby Sierra Nevada he relocated to Camptonville—near the Yuba River and the California Mother Lode country—where he made his living as a millwright and carpenter. Pelton spent much of his time reading and observing mining activity; his work and studies gained him critical knowledge of mining equipment and processes and related engineering principles.

==Inventing the Pelton wheel==


Pelton&#x27;s ideas for improving the turbine water wheel came from his studies of mining equipment and operations in California&#x27;s gold rush country. Summary descriptions of the local technology observed by Pelton, and of the science by which his turbine water wheel extracts kinetic energy from a coursing mountain stream follow...

Steam-heat powered much of local mining activities but required a lot of wood for fuel; nearby forests were routinely decimated. Turbine water wheels also were used to supply power, but these were inefficient in converting the kinetic energy of mountain streams to horsepower. D.P. Stern reports: &quot;According to a 1939 article by W. F. Durand of Stanford University in Mechanical Engineering, Pelton&#x27;s invention started from an accidental observation some time in the 1870s. Pelton was watching a spinning water turbine when the key holding its wheel onto its shaft slipped, causing it to become misaligned. Instead of the jet hitting the cups in their middle, the slippage made it hit near the edge; rather than the water flow being stopped, it was now deflected into a half-circle, coming out again with reversed direction. Surprisingly, the turbine now moved faster. That was Pelton&#x27;s great discovery. In other turbines the jet hit the middle of the cup and the splash of the impacting water wasted energy.&quot;

Experimenting and modelling, Pelton improved upon the efficiency of the Knight wheel (developed earlier by the Knight Foundry at nearby Sutter Creek). The Knight wheel received the streamflow jet slightly off-center and at an angle into a &quot;single&quot; turbine cup. Alternatively, the Pelton wheel—by deploying a &quot;split double&quot; cup (in effect two cups side-by-side), then splitting the impinging water-jet directly onto the common vane of the double cup—captured a stream&#x27;s kinetic energy more efficiently. There were two prime results of Pelton&#x27;s design: it consolidated the introduction of a new physical science into the ancient human quest to develop hydropower, i.e., the science of the &quot;impulse&quot; turbine as opposed to the &quot;reaction&quot; turbine; and it revolutionized the use of turbines adapted for high head (i.e., elevation energy) sites. Before Pelton, almost all water turbines were reaction machines powered by water pressure, or head, while Pelton&#x27;s wheel was powered by the kinetic energy of a high velocity water-jet which could be conveniently developed from a small mountain stream.

==Building the Pelton wheel==

In the late 1870s Pelton modeled, tested and manufactured his first turbine wheel, dubbed the &quot;Pelton Runner&quot;—later referring to the impulse blades only—at the Miners Foundry in Nevada City, California.
In 1878, at the Mayflower Mine in Nevada City, he installed the first operational Pelton wheel. At that time the Knight Foundry wheel was being sold as the industry standard, but in a head-to-head competition staged in 1883 at the Idaho Mine in nearby Grass Valley, Pelton&#x27;s design proved much more efficient.
The Pelton design provided 90 percent efficiency (of converting streamflow kinetic energy to horsepower) while the next best competitor achieved less than 77 percent—at a time when most extant water wheels typically rated less than 40 percent.

The Pelton wheel also provided sustained power during (typical) lowflow conditions in a mountain stream. In 1887 a miner attached Pelton&#x27;s wheel to a dynamo and produced the first hydroelectric power in the Sierra Nevada.

In 1895, the largest installation of Pelton&#x27;s wheel during his lifetime was accomplished at the North Star Mine Powerhouse, Grass Valley, California, by the engineer Arthur De Wint Foote, who designed and installed an over-sized wheel of 30 feet diameter; it performed successfully, greatly increasing the hydropower delivered by the Pelton runners to produce compressed air for mining operations.

Pelton patented his wheel as well as his novel design of the double cup runner, and in 1888 formed the Pelton Water Wheel Company in San Francisco to supply the growing demand for hydropower and hydroelectricity throughout the West and world-wide. &#x27;Pelton&#x27; is a trademark name for the products of that company, but the term is widely used generically for similar impulse turbines.

==Death, legacy and awards==

Pelton died in California at the age of seventy-eight and is interred at his family cemetery site in Vermilion, Ohio. His &quot;Pelton Runner&quot; design is still used to produce hydroelectric power in the United States and around the world, as shown here. Later designs such as the Turgo turbine, first patented in 1919, and the Banki turbine were inspired by the Pelton wheel.

In 1895, The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, awarded Lester Pelton the Elliott Cresson Medal, since renamed the Benjamin Franklin Medal, for Pelton&#x27;s accomplishments of invention in technology. In 2006, he was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Alexandra, Virginia, formerly in Akron, Ohio.
There are memorials and monuments celebrating Pelton and the &quot;Pelton Runner&quot; mounted in Camptonvlle, California, in the Miners Foundry in Nevada City, California, and at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C., California Resort at Disneyland in Anaheim, among other sites.

In 1958, the actor William Hudson was cast as Pelton in the episode &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; on the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The episode focuses on Pelton&#x27;s development of the principles of hydraulic mining.

<doc id="844315" wikidata="Q470375" url="?curid=844315" title="Belle de Jour (film)">
<text>Belle de Jour () is a 1967 surrealist erotic psychological drama film directed by Luis Buñuel, from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jean-Claude Carrière. Based on the 1928 novel of the same name by Joseph Kessel, the film stars Catherine Deneuve in the leading role, a young housewife who spends her midweek afternoons as a high-class prostitute, while her husband is at work. It co-stars Jean Sorel, and Michel Piccoli, and features Geneviève Page, Francisco Rabal, Pierre Clémenti, Francis Blanche and Georges Marchal in supporting roles.

The title of the film is a play on words on the French term &quot;belle de nuit&quot; (&quot;beauty of the night&quot;, i.e., a prostitute), as Séverine works during the day under the pseudonym &quot;Belle de Jour&quot;. Her nickname can also be interpreted as a reference to the French name of the morning glory (&quot;Convolvulaceae&quot;), meaning &quot;beauty of [the] day&quot;, a flower that blooms only during the day.

&quot;Belle de Jour&quot; is one of Buñuel&#x27;s most successful and famous films. It was Deneuve&#x27;s second acclaimed success after &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;. It won the Golden Lion and the Pasinetti Award for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival in 1967. Deneuve was nominated for BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

==Plot==
Séverine Serizy, a young and beautiful housewife, is unable to share physical intimacy with her husband, Dr. Pierre Serizy, despite their love for each other. Her sexual life is restricted to elaborate fantasies involving domination, sadomasochism, and bondage. Although frustrated by his wife&#x27;s frigidity toward him, he respects her wishes.

While visiting a ski resort, they meet two friends, Henri Husson and Renée. Séverine does not like Husson&#x27;s manner and the way he looks at her. Back in Paris, Séverine meets up with Renée and learns that a common friend, Henriette, now works at a brothel. At her home, Séverine receives roses from Husson and is unsettled by the gesture. At the tennis courts, she meets Husson and they discuss Henriette and houses of pleasure. Husson mentions a high-class brothel to Séverine at 11 Cité Jean de Saumur. He also confesses his desire for her, but Séverine rejects his advances.

Haunted by childhood memories, including one involving a man who appears to touch her inappropriately, Séverine goes to the high-class brothel, which is run by Madame Anaïs, who names her &quot;Belle de Jour.&quot; That afternoon Séverine services her first client. Reluctant at first, she responds to the &quot;firm hand&quot; of Madame Anaïs and has sex with the stranger. After staying away for a week, Séverine returns to the brothel and begins working from two to five o&#x27;clock each day, returning to her unsuspecting husband in the evenings. One day, Husson comes to visit her at home, but Séverine refuses to see him. Still, she fantasizes about having sex with him in her husband&#x27;s presence. At the same time, Séverine&#x27;s physical relationship with her husband is improving and she begins having sex with him.

Séverine becomes involved with a young criminal, Marcel, who offers her the kind of thrills and excitement of her fantasies. One day, Husson visits the brothel and discovers Séverine, who asks him not to tell her husband about her secret life. He agrees and rejects her services, stating he is no longer attracted to her. Séverine decides to leave the brothel, with Madame Anaïs&#x27; blessing as she believes it is due to Marcel becoming increasingly jealous and demanding. After one of his associates follows Séverine to her home, Marcel visits her and threatens to reveal her secret to her husband. Séverine pleads with him to leave, which he does, referring to her husband as &quot;the obstacle&quot;.

Marcel waits downstairs for Pierre to return home and shoots him three times. Marcel then flees but is shot dead by police. Séverine&#x27;s husband survives but is left in a coma. The police are unable to find a motive for the attempted murder. Sometime later Séverine is at home taking care of Pierre, who is now paralysed, blind and in a wheelchair. Husson visits Pierre to tell him the truth about his wife&#x27;s secret life; she does not try to stop him. After Husson leaves, Séverine returns to see Pierre crying. In an ambiguous ending which is hinted to be another of her fantasies, Pierre then gets out of the wheelchair, pours himself a drink and discusses holiday plans with Séverine.

==Cast==

==Production==

In 1966, Buñuel was contacted by the Hakim brothers, Robert and Raymond, Egyptian-French producers who specialized in sexy films directed by star filmmakers, who offered him the opportunity to direct a film version of Joseph Kessel&#x27;s novel &quot;Belle de Jour&quot;, a book about an affluent young woman who leads a double life as a prostitute, and that had caused a scandal upon its first publication in 1928. Buñuel did not like Kessel&#x27;s novel, considering it &quot;a bit of a soap opera&quot;, but he took on the challenge because: &quot;I found it interesting to try to turn something I didn&#x27;t like into something I did.&quot; So he and Carrière set out enthusiastically to interview women in the brothels of Madrid to learn about their sexual fantasies. Buñuel also was not happy about the choice of the 22-year-old Catherine Deneuve for the title role, feeling that she had been foisted upon him by the Hakim brothers and Deneuve&#x27;s lover at the time, director François Truffaut. As a result, both actress and director found working together difficult, with Deneuve claiming, &quot;I felt they showed more of me than they&#x27;d said they were going to. There were moments when I felt totally used. I was very unhappy,&quot; and Buñuel deriding her prudery on the set. 

Principal photography lasted from 10 October 1966 to 12 December 1966.

===Costume design===
Much of Deneuve&#x27;s wardrobe was designed by Yves St. Laurent and Roger Vivier.

== Sequel ==
The 2006 film &quot;Belle Toujours&quot;, by Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira, is a sequel to &quot;Belle de Jour.&quot; Set 30 years after the first film, it follows an encounter between the characters of Séverine and Henri . Michel Piccoli reprised his role as Henri, while Bulle Ogier replaced Catherine Deneuve as Séverine.

==Legacy==
Brooke Magnanti a former London escort who penned the 2005 book &quot;The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl&quot; used &quot;Belle de Jour&quot; as her alias and pen name. The books were later adapted into the 2007 TV series &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot; starring Billie Piper as de Jour.

<text>Yves Camille Désiré Leterme (; born 6 October 1960) is a Belgian politician, a leader of the Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&amp;V). He was the prime minister of Belgium from March 2008 to December 2008, and later from November 2009 to December 2011.

Leterme has also served as minister of Foreign Affairs, deputy prime minister and minister of Budget, Institutional Reforms, Transport and the North Sea in the Belgian federal government. He is a former minister-president of Flanders and Flemish minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. Despite his French name, Leterme is Flemish. He is fluent in Dutch, French and English.

On 14 July 2008, facing the imminent failure to meet a self-imposed deadline to enact &quot;constitutional reform&quot; consisting of further devolution of powers to the nation&#x27;s three linguistic communities, Leterme tendered his resignation to King Albert II. On 17 July, King Albert, after holding a flurry of consultations with leaders of political parties, labour unions, and the employers&#x27; association, rejected Leterme&#x27;s resignation. Instead, the King appointed a three-person commission of representatives of the linguistic communities to investigate how to restart the reform process. The commission was to report to the King by 31 July 2008.

On 19 December 2008 he offered his resignation to King Albert II after a crisis surrounding the sale of Fortis to BNP Paribas. On 22 December 2008 the King accepted his resignation, along with that of his entire government. He remained prime minister until 30 December, when Herman Van Rompuy was appointed as his successor. On 24 November 2009, it was announced that Leterme would once again become prime minister, succeeding Van Rompuy, who had been selected to become the first President of the European Council.

On 22 April 2010 he once again offered his resignation to King Albert II after a key Flemish party, the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats, withdrew its support for the coalition government. An election followed in June, resulting in protracted attempts to negotiate a governing coalition. Leterme remained as caretaker prime minister, but on 13 September 2011 announced that he would leave the post by the end of the year to take up the position of Deputy Secretary-General at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. On 6 December 2011 Leterme was finally succeeded as prime minister by Elio Di Rupo, ending the longest run of a caretaker government in the developed world. The following day he was appointed to the honorary title of Minister of State.

==Early life==
Yves Leterme was born on 6 October 1960 in the city of Wervik in the province of West Flanders. He is half-Walloon, and grew up fluently bilingual. He studied law at the Catholic University of Leuven where he received a LL.B. degree in 1981 and then studied at Ghent University where he obtained a BSc degree in Political Science (1983), a LL.M. degree (1984), and a MPA degree in 1985.

== Career ==
Before entering national politics, Leterme served as an auditor at the country&#x27;s Court of Audit (, ). He then became adjunct and then national secretary of the Christian People&#x27;s Party until he resigned to become a civil servant with the European Union. In 1997, he went on indefinite leave from that position when he was appointed Member of the Belgian Parliament. He has been a member of the city council of Ypres since 1995. He served as alderman of Ypres from 1995 to 2001.

He was appointed to the Chamber of Representatives in 1997, elected in 1999 and 2003. After the defeat of the CD&amp;V in the general elections of 2003, he succeeded Stefaan De Clerck as party chairman. In 2004 Yves Leterme became Minister-President of the Flemish government. Flanders has fared well during his term in office. Yves Leterme took a pragmatic course of increasing the economic dynamic and social wellbeing in Flanders. He has made the Flemish government into the &#x27;investment government&#x27;, focusing the investments on the infrastructure and logistics with respect to both the business climate and social wellbeing (notably Flanders Port Area, homes for the elderly, child care, and immigrant integration). To accelerate investment he has successfully encouraged the use of the PPP structures. Additionally, Yves Leterme&#x27;s government implemented rigorous budgeting – his government started with a sizeable implicit debt in Flanders which has been reduced to zero as the result of his policies.

In the elections held on 10 June 2007, Leterme received 796,521 personal votes, leading his party to a landslide victory. This was the second highest number of personal votes ever in Belgium&#x27;s national elections. On 21 December 2007, he became Vice-Prime Minister of Belgium and Minister of Budget, Transport, Institutional Reform and the North Sea. On 23 March, Leterme received confidence of the chamber as prime minister.

==Controversies==
Many French-speaking journalists have taken offence at Leterme&#x27;s political opinions on the widely supported demand in Flanders for more regional autonomy. They consistently decry him for making what they say are provocative or erroneous statements.

During an interview with the French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; in August 2006, Leterme, who is bilingual with a French-speaking father (and having a French name), made a remark about the overall failure and refusal of French-speaking inhabitants to learn and use Dutch in certain municipalities, more specifically in municipalities with language facilities.
Most prominent Francophone politicians such as Elio Di Rupo and Isabelle Durant along with some Flemish politicians such as Pascal Smet and Guy Vanhengel objected to this remark. In the Flemish daily &quot;De Standaard&quot; of 28 August Leterme explained his words: &quot;I am allowed to ask myself the question whether the lack of knowledge of Dutch is a matter of not wanting or not being able to.&quot;

A news report produced by the Belgian Francophone television company RTBF alleged that Leterme said in the Flemish parliament: &quot;I don&#x27;t need the King&quot;. According to Flemish newspapers, this sentence was taken out of context, because Leterme was talking about the creation of Flemish statutes (decrees): legislation approved by the Flemish parliament, unlike federal legislation, does not need the king&#x27;s signature to become law. The Flemish Minister-President signs the decrees himself.

On one occasion, Leterme quipped that the only things common to all Belgians are &quot;the King, the football team, some beers...&quot;. Upon being asked by a television journalist to name which event is commemorated by Belgium&#x27;s national day (21 July), Leterme wrongly replied that it was the proclamation of the constitution, when the correct answer is the coronation of the country&#x27;s first King, Leopold I of Belgium. Subsequently, he was asked if he knew the French version of the Belgian national anthem, whereupon he began to sing the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;, the French national anthem, instead of the &quot;Brabançonne&quot;.

Leterme caused controversy again in a December 2007 interview with the Concentra newspapers by denouncing the RTBF for having its own political agenda, being a propagandist for CDH politician Joëlle Milquet and being a relic of the past. Leterme further compared the broadcaster to Radio Mille Collines, which was a Rwandan propaganda outlet against the Tutsis during the Rwandan genocide, though he later mentioned he had only quoted what was said in political circles.

== 2007 general elections ==
On 6 May 2007, he officially launched his candidacy for the general election on 10 June 2007, leading his party&#x27;s list of candidates. On election day, he received about 800,000 preferential votes, the second largest number of votes ever gained in the history of Belgian elections. This was one of the greatest monster tallies in recent Belgian history (the previous comparable score was obtained by Leo Tindemans).

Based on this personal tally, on the successful tally of his party, and on the general election tallies which saw progress for most parties making the strongest demands for greater Flemish autonomy, such as CD&amp;V, New-Flemish Alliance and the new Lijst Dedecker (LDD), status quo for the left-wing Greens, and regression for the far right Vlaams Belang and parties making only modest demands for greater Flemish autonomy, such as OpenVLD and Socialist Party - Different. Leterme as &quot;formateur&quot; convened the negotiations to form a coalition government, negotiations which would turn out to be protracted and initially lead to a stalemate.

== 2007–2008 political stalemate ==

Yves Leterme was the favourite to become the next Prime Minister of Belgium following the 2007 General Election. From 16 July to 23 August 2007, Leterme led the formal coalition talks into forming a new government. But the negotiations failed over constitutional reform and on 23 August he resigned as &quot;formateur&quot;.

On 29 September, Herman Van Rompuy, &quot;explorer&quot; in the coalition seeking process, presented his final report to the King. Later that day, King Albert II again appointed Leterme as &quot;formateur&quot;. On 7 November, his party took the initiative and got the Flemish representatives to vote on the most crucial aspect of the negotiations, the splitting of the electoral region of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, a measure strongly opposed by the Francophone community.

Leterme again offered his resignation to the King on 1 December, after coalition talks failed to reach an agreement on several issues.

An interim government under Guy Verhofstadt was sworn in on 21 December 2007. In it, Leterme became deputy prime minister and Minister of the Budget, Institutional Reform, and Transport. He was anticipated to become prime minister in a new government in March 2008.

Belgium&#x27;s political uncertainty further deepened when Yves Leterme was hospitalised on 14 February 2008. Rumours that he was suffering from hepatitis were formally denied by a spokesman, and it was later disclosed that he had suffered internal bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. His duties as Minister for Budget and Institutional Reform were temporarily taken over by Jo Vandeurzen (CD&amp;V), the Minister for Justice.

==Prime Minister of Belgium, first premiership==
On 18 March 2008, an agreement between five parties on the formation of the new government was announced. Leterme was sworn in as prime minister on 20 March, and his government was approved by the Chamber of Representatives on 22 March, with 97 votes in favour, 48 against, and one abstaining.

For Leterme, priority issues were still further devolution of power to Belgium&#x27;s regions, which would require amending the national constitution, and resolving dissatisfaction with the administrative status of the districts of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde. He set a deadline of 15 July 2008 to accomplish these goals. The deadline was not met. On 15 July 2008, King Albert II issued a communiqué that Leterme had offered his resignation to the king, and that the king was reserving his decision on whether to accept the resignation. The next day, the king held consultations with the leaders of political parties, the employers&#x27; association, and trades unions. By the end of the day, it was still not resolved whether Leterme would actually be departing from the prime ministership. Leterme declared, &quot;It appears that the [language] communities&#x27; conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible . . . state reform remains essential&quot;.

===Fortis and fall of government===
Along with his counterparts in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, Leterme decided to nationalise ailing financial-services company Fortis. The company was split and the Belgian government sold the Belgian part to French bank BNP Paribas. The shareholders, who were not consulted in the sale, sued the Belgian state. Although at first the government won, on appeal the court of appeal reversed the judgement of the lower court and ordered the freezing of the sale. Following the verdict, First President Ghislain Londers of the Court of Cassation indicated that government officials had tried to influence the judges. Leterme tendered his resignation and that of his government on 19 December 2008, which was accepted by King Albert II on 22 December.

==Minister of Foreign Affairs and Second Premiership==

With 17 July 2009 government reshuffle, Leterme succeeded Karel De Gucht, who became European Commissioner, as the minister of foreign affairs in the Van Rompuy I Government. Following Van Rompuy&#x27;s assignation as president of the European Council, Leterme once again became Prime Minister of Belgium. His place as Minister of Foreign Affairs was taken by Steven Vanackere.

In complicated negotiations regarding the bilingual electoral unit Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde surrounding Belgian capital Brussels a deadline set by government party Open VLD was not met. Following the departure on 22 April 2010 of this party from the government Leterme had to offer the resignation of his government once again. On 26 April the resignation was accepted by the King after the appointed mediator Didier Reynders failed in his task and a general election was held in June 2010. Due to the longitivity of the negotiations for the government formation, Leterme headed a caretaker government for 589 days—the longest-such run for a developed country—until Elio di Rupo was finally appointed prime minister in December 2011.

==Post-premiership==
After Elio Di Rupo succeeded him as prime minister, Leterme took up the position of Deputy Secretary-General at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), starting 1 January 2012.

Leterme still supported his party in the October 2012 municipal elections. He was the main candidate for the CD&amp;V/N-VA list in Ypres, which maintained its absolute majority. During the election he said &quot;Honesty commands me to tell you I cannot become mayor right away because I must honour my earlier commitment to the OECD.&quot; And so after winning the election, Leterme remained active at international level, and third runner up in the party, Jan Durnez became mayor of Ypres instead.

In 2014, Leterme became secretary-general of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA). On 7 March 2016 he announced his definitive departure from political life as he did not see himself able to combine it anymore with his international career. He has since taken on a number of paid and unpaid positions:

* Volkswagen, Member of the Sustainability Council (since 2016)
* Kofi Annan Foundation, Vice-Chair of the Commission on Elections and Democracy in the Digital Age (since 2018)

In 2019, Leterme became co-chairman of the board of directors of the Chinese investment fund ToJoy, alongside the former Serbian president Boris Tadić and José María Figueres, former president of Costa Rica. The appointment was criticized by international relations professor Jonathan Holslag, citing the close relations between ToJoy and the Chinese political establishment.

==Foreign relations==

===Lebanon===
On 29 November 2008, President of Lebanon Michel Sleiman discussed with Leterme the Lebanese domestic situation and its foreign relations, particularly its relations with Syria.

===Vietnam===
On 11 August 2009, Leterme started a two-day visit to Vietnam to boost bilateral and multifaceted co-operation between the two countries. It was his first official visit to Vietnam since Leterme took up his post as foreign minister the previous month. Leterme met with Vietnamese officials to strengthen bilateral relations and co-operation in several sectors including politics, economics, and trade and investment, as well as discussed regional and global issues that are of interest to both sides. Vietnam is currently the only Asian country receiving preferential development aid from the Belgian government for the 2007–2010 period, in the amount of 32 million euro (US$45 million). In 2008, two-way trade reached nearly $1.4 billion and Belgium is now Vietnam&#x27;s fourth largest export market among EU countries.

== Private life and hobbies ==

Leterme is known to be very fond of goats. He breeds goats in his private time in the small farm where he lives. In November 2010 the Belgian newspaper &quot;Het Nieuwsblad&quot; had some more news about Yves&#x27; favourite animals: two of his favourite goats, named Trudy and Vicky, were to appear in a play by the local theatre society of Ypres. The play is called &#x27;Island of the goats&#x27;. In an interview Yves called goats &quot;The poor man&#x27;s cow.&quot;

<text>The Libertine () is a 1968 Italian sex comedy film directed by Pasquale Festa Campanile and starring Catherine Spaak and Jean-Louis Trintignant.

==Plot==
Mimi, a young widow, discovers that her recently deceased husband kept a secret apartment for his kinky desires. Frustrated that he did not explore his sexual fantasies with her, she embarks on a quest to understand perversion and sexuality. She uses her late husband&#x27;s apartment to seduce various men, each time learning more about the depths of human depravation, as well as the extent of the sexual double standard for women (late in the film, she states, &quot;I notice men only call me a whore when I say no. Or stop saying yes.&quot;)

Finally, she meets the man who shares himself fully with her, appreciates her sexual daring and accepts her for whoever she is.

==Cast==
==Reception==
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film was &quot;not nearly as clever, sophisticated and amusing as it archly pretends.&quot; The &quot;Guardian&quot; called it &quot;pseudo-sophisticated, so fake as to be positively sick making and, what is more, thoroughly unerotic.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; complained &quot;the film&#x27;s own attitudes are far too conventional&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; thought the film was &quot;at times... pretty hot stuff... has a little more style and wit than most Radley Metzger releases.&quot; Terry Clifford of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; thought the film was &quot;more clumsy than clever... just as unimaginative as the film it attempts to parody.&quot;

<doc id="844325" wikidata="Q689300" url="?curid=844325" title="The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant">
<text>The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant () is a 1972 West German psychological romantic drama film written and directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, based on his play of the same name. Featuring an all-female cast, the film takes place entirely in the home of fashion designer Petra von Kant (Margit Carstensen), following the changing dynamics in her relationships with other women. The film was entered into the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival. It is regarded by many as Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and a classic of New German Cinema.

==Plot==
Petra von Kant is a prominent fashion designer based in Bremen. The film is almost totally restricted to her apartment&#x27;s bedroom, decorated by a huge reproduction of Nicolas Poussin&#x27;s &quot;Midas and Bacchus&quot;.

Petra&#x27;s marriages have ended in death or divorce. Her first husband, Pierre, her great love, died in a car accident while she was pregnant; her second marriage ended in disgust. Petra lives with Marlene, another designer, whom she treats as a slave.

=== First act ===
Marlene wakes Petra. She begins her day and gets dressed while Marlene attends to her. Petra makes a phone call to her mother, makes demands of Marlene (including slow-dancing), and dons a brown wig just before her cousin Sidonie visits.

Petra talks to Sidonie about their marriages while Marlene works and acts as hostess. Sidonie&#x27;s friend Karin Thimm joins them. Newly returned to Germany after residing in Sydney for five years, Karin is an attractive but shallow 23-year-old woman. Immediately attracted to Karin, Petra suggests she become a model. Karin agrees to return the following day.

=== Second act ===
The next day, with Marlene showing signs of frustration, Petra, wearing a larger, dark wig, offers to support Karin while she trains to be a model. Petra learns that Karin is married (her husband has remained in Sydney) but is only momentarily put off by this revelation. The women discuss their differences. Petra had a happy childhood and came from a home where the good things in life were always stressed, while Karin&#x27;s father was a toolmaker and she always felt neglected by her parents. Petra loved mathematics at school, but Karin could never understand algebra. Petra has a daughter she rarely sees, but she reassures herself that her daughter is at the best possible boarding school.

Karin&#x27;s parents are dead. She says people reject her when they learn her history, but Petra says that her affection for Karin is even stronger after learning about her past. Petra orders Marlene to get a bottle of Sekt. Karin reveals how her parents died: her father was laid off because of his age, killed his wife, and then hanged himself in a drunken stupor. Karin feels she has drifted in life; her husband treated her like a slave and offered no reprieve from her past. Petra says this is about to change. Marlene returns with the bottle of Sekt and silently returns to her typing as Petra and Karin toast. Petra promises to make Karin a great model; Marlene stops typing and glares at Petra. Petra says that life is predestined, people are brutal and hard, and everyone is replaceable. Discovering that Karin is staying at a hotel, she suggests she move in with her. Petra admits to being in love with Karin, but Karin can only say she likes Petra.

=== Third act ===
About six months later, Petra, in a red wig, is getting dressed, while Karin is in bed reading a magazine. Petra cancels a flight reservation to Madrid for the two of them over the telephone. Karin says Marlene is strange, but Petra says Marlene loves her. Upon Petra&#x27;s insistent questioning, Karin says that she slept with an African-American soldier the previous night. Freddy, Karin&#x27;s husband, telephones from Zurich; it emerges that they have been in contact by letter, and that Karin is rejoining him. Petra calls her a &quot;rotten little whore&quot;, and Karin responds that being with her is less strenuous than working the streets. She asks Petra to book a flight to Frankfurt, where she is to meet her husband, and asks for 500 marks; Petra gives her 1,000. A drunken Petra has Marlene drive Karin to the airport.

=== Fourth act ===
On Petra&#x27;s birthday, the bedroom is almost empty. Lying on the floor and wearing a blond wig, Petra drinks heavily and waits for Karin to call. Her daughter, Gaby, arrives. Petra tells her little; Gaby says she has fallen in love with a young man, but that it is unrequited. Sidonie appears with a birthday present: a doll with blond hair like Karin&#x27;s. She mentions that Karin is in Bremen. Petra&#x27;s mother, Valerie, arrives. Petra accuses her of being a whore who never worked, living off first her husband and then Petra. Petra tramples on a china tea service and smashes glasses against the wall. Previously unaware of Karin, Valerie is shocked that Petra is in love with a woman. Petra says she hates Gaby and never wants to see Sidonie again, but Gaby stays.

=== Final act ===
Later that night, Petra lies in bed without a wig. Valerie tells her that Gaby cried herself to sleep. Petra apologizes to her mother, and says she did not love Karin but merely wanted to possess her. Karin calls, and Petra amicably declines to see her before she leaves for Paris, suggesting that perhaps they will meet again sometime. Petra turns to Marlene after her mother has left and apologizes for treating her badly. She promises that all will be different between them and that she will share her life with her. Marlene, who has satisfied her masochistic desire in submitting to Petra, packs her belongings, including a pistol, in a small suitcase and leaves, taking the doll as she walks away.

==Cast==
* Margit Carstensen as Petra von Kant
* Irm Hermann as Marlene
* Hanna Schygulla as Karin Thimm
* Gisela Fackeldey as Valerie von Kant
* Eva Mattes as Gabriele (Gaby) von Kant
* Katrin Schaake as Sidonie von Grasenabb

== Themes ==
Solitude, love, and codependency are key themes explored in &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant.&quot; The solitary setting of Petra&#x27;s bedroom maximizes the dramatic tension while mirroring her entrapment. The items in Petra&#x27;s room and the positioning of the camera relative to the reproduction of &quot;Midas and Bacchus&quot; are manipulated to reflect and comment on the action.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 84% approval rating from 31 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A thoughtful drama that grows even more powerful in retrospect, &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; sensitively depicts a woman&#x27;s tortured search for connection.&quot;

==Operatic adaptation==

The text of the play, in its English translation by Denis Calandra, was employed by Gerald Barry as the libretto for his five-act opera, commissioned by RTÉ and English National Opera and premiered in Dublin and London in 2005. The opera is also available on CD featuring the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; is considered a landmark of European cinema that secured Fassbinder&#x27;s status as a respected auteur.

The 2014 film &quot;Clouds of Sils Maria&quot; revolves around a remount of a fictional play, &quot;Maloja Snake&quot;, about an intergenerational lesbian relationship. The film&#x27;s director, Olivier Assayas, acknowledged a link between &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; and &quot;Maloja Snake&quot;.

Peter Strickland has cited &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; as a major influence on his 2015 film &quot;The Duke of Burgundy&quot;.

In 2022, director François Ozon released &quot;Peter von Kant&quot;, a reinterpretation of the film centred on a male director.

<doc id="844334" wikidata="Q3361537" url="?curid=844334" title="Palliser (Saskatchewan electoral district)">
<text>Palliser was a federal electoral district in Saskatchewan, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2015. It was named in honour of John Palliser, a geographer and explorer of the Canadian West.

==Geography==
It included the city of Moose Jaw, the southwest quadrant of the city of Regina and the rural areas around them.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1996 from Moose Jaw—Lake Centre and parts of Regina—Lumsden, Regina—Wascana and Swift Current—Maple Creek—Assiniboia ridings.

The Conservative Party of Canada took back this historically New Democratic Party (NDP) seat in 2004.

Following the Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012, the riding was abolished. The Regina portion became part of the new riding of Regina—Lewvan, while Moose Jaw and the rural portion became part of Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan. Small parts of the riding were transferred to Cypress Hills—Grasslands and Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle.

<doc id="844335" wikidata="Q1476266" url="?curid=844335" title="Tokyo Decadence">
<text>is a 1992 Japanese pink film. This erotic film was directed by Ryū Murakami (村上 龍) with music by Ryuichi Sakamoto (坂本 龍一 ). The film was shot and completed during 1991 and released in the start of 1992. It stars Miho Nikaido (二階堂 美穂) and is also referred to as Topaz, that title being both the translation of the original Japanese title and that of the Murakami story it is an adaptation of. Because of the cruel and graphic nature of this film, it has been banned in several countries such as Australia and South Korea. Shimada Masahiko (島田 雅彦) also makes an appearance in this film. The story follows , the submissive and lovesick prostitute who goes about her trade with misery and is being abused by hedonists and criminals while trying to find some sort of appeasement away from the fact that her lover is currently married.

==Plot==
Ai, a timid 22-year-old college student in Tokyo, works as a prostitute for an exclusive escort agency that caters to wealthy, perverted men. To please her clients, Ai has to play out elaborate fantasy scenarios involving sexual humiliation and light sadomasochism/bondage.

Ai visits a fortune-teller, played by Yayoi Kusama, who advises her to find a &quot;pink stone&quot;, and then fashion it into a ring. The fortune teller also advises Ai to put a telephone directory under her television, and to avoid a gallery in the east. When she later loses the ring she risks her life to recover it.

Ai shows an emotional connection to one of her clients, another sex worker who is a female dominant and who Ai clearly admires. She confides to this client that she has unrequited love for the gallery artist, and Ai&#x27;s client tells her that she must live life to the fullest otherwise she will be filled with regrets. She tells Ai that she must confront this part of her life then she can move forward as her future will be hers.

Taking the advice of her female client, and an unidentified drug which her client gave her to provide her with the courage of lions, she becomes dangerously inebriated and fails in an attempt to meet her ex lover.

She meets the artist&#x27;s wife who sings for her, saying that it&#x27;s a great audience even though Ai is the only other person present. The wife says that they were previously rivals but because the artist is in dementia the rivalry is over and they can be friends. The wife is then collected by her nurse who says that if anything happens to the wife she will be held responsible. After Ai attempts to break into the artist&#x27;s house the police are called and take her into custody. She is rescued from the police by the artist&#x27;s wife who is said to have once been a great singer but is now crazy.

Throughout the film, Ai&#x27;s movements have been timid and stiff and her posture demure. After the credits there is a sequence of her dancing on stage boldly and fluidly thus finalizing her growth in to her new future.

<text>is a 1995 Japanese erotic film directed by Shōji Tanaka and based on a story by Kenichi Yamakawa.

==Synopsis==
Ryō Masuda (Toshio Kakei) is a director of S&amp;M movies who asks a woman he meets on a crowded street to star in one of his films. The woman, Yumi Sakata, accepts on a whim but her expressive features—in particular, her eyes—make that particular low-budget production into an unexpected hit. Ryō is attracted to her but feels there is something dangerous or evil about her and does not want to have anything more to do with her. However, it is not that simple.

Ryō&#x27;s girlfriend, Mayumi, is a dominatrix who services a very powerful man. Mayumi&#x27;s client, Mr. Okonogi, wants Yumi to work in an S&amp;M show club he owns. Mayumi fears she may be &quot;sacrificed&quot; if Mr. Okonogi doesn&#x27;t get want he wants and she begs Ryō to find Yumi and persuade her to go to the S&amp;M club.

Ryō finally persuades Yumi to go to the club with him and Mayumi by telling her that he loves her and that Mayumi is an ex-girlfriend from a long time ago. Yumi becomes a star dominatrix (even through the film Ryō made showed her being whipped rather than whipping submissives as she does at the club).

Ryō finds himself torn between his feelings for Mayumi and Yumi&#x27;s expectations. He also stands to make a considerable amount of money as Yumi&#x27;s &quot;manager&quot; and companion.

Mr. Okonogi, who defines sadism and masochism as &quot;two sides of the same coin,&quot; and who enjoys watching as well as participating, refuses to let Mayumi retire. It appears that he has the power of life-and-death over her. One of Mayumi&#x27;s female friends, Natsumi, commits suicide rather than continue working in the S&amp;M industry. Mayumi goes to the funeral. Ryō does not.

==Cast==
* Toshio Kakei () as Ryō Masuda
* Yoshiko Yura () as Yumi Sakata
* Kumi Shiraishi () as Mayumi Yamane (dominatrix)
* Yōsuke Nakajima () as Dai
* Renji Ishibashi () as Ryūsaku Okunogi

<text>The Southern District (, &quot;Meḥoz HaDarom&quot;; ) is one of Israel&#x27;s six administrative districts, the largest in terms of land area but the most sparsely populated. It covers most of the Negev desert, as well as the Arava valley. The population of the Southern District is 1,086,240 and its area is 14,185 km2. Its population is 79.66% Jewish and 12.72% Arab (mostly Muslim), with 7.62% of other origins.

The district capital is Beersheba, while the largest city is Ashdod. Beersheba&#x27;s dormitory towns of Omer, Meitar, and Lehavim are affluent on an Israel scale, while the development towns of Dimona, Sderot, Netivot, Ofakim, and Yeruham and the seven Bedouin cities are lower on the socio-economic scale.

== Administrative local authorities ==
Some villages do not fall under the jurisdiction of a regional council. These include:

* Mahane Yatir

<text>The Dublin Magazine was an Irish literary journal founded and edited by the poet Seumas O&#x27;Sullivan (real name James Sullivan Starkey) and published in &quot;Dublin&quot; by &quot;Dublin Publishers, Ltd., 9 Commercial Buildings. &quot;London&quot;: Elkin Mathews, Cork St. W.1.&quot; The last page of the July 1925 issue (below the book reviews) states the it was printed by Cahill &amp; Co. Ltd. Parkgate Printing Works and published by the proprietors of The Dublin Magazine at 7–9 Commercial Buildings, Dame Street, Dublin.

From August 1923 to August 1925 it was published as a monthly, then as a quarterly from January 1926 to June 1958, ceasing publication on O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s death. The cover for the first issue was designed by artist Harry Clarke. The magazine featured fiction, poetry, drama and reviews and contributors included nearly every significant Irish writer of the period, including the playwright Samuel Beckett, the poet Austin Clarke, popular novelist Maurice Walsh, as well as Padraic Fallon, Padraic Colum, Patrick Kavanagh and Blanaid Salkeld among others.

The Dubliner was founded by a group of Trinity College Dublin (TCD) students who also set up New Square Publications in order to publish this professional literary magazine. The editor was Donald Carroll, an American graduate of TCD. The first issue was Nov.-Dec. 1961 where it was announced that it would be published bi-monthly. The second issue did not appear until March, 1962 and stated that Carroll&#x27;s editorship had been taken over by Bruce Arnold, a TCD graduate from England living in Raheny, Co. Dublin. The Dubliner was published by New Square Publications, but soon became a quarterly with the Spring 1963 issue. Bruce Arnold&#x27;s resignation was announced in the Spring 1964 issue with the new joint editors being Rivers Carew (an Englishman, TCD graduate, living in Ireland) and Timothy Brownlow (a Dubliner and TCD graduate). 

In the spring of 1965 The Dubliner changed its name back to its illustrious predecessor, The Dublin Magazine, with the agreement of Seumas O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s widow, Estella Solomons, whose consent the editors gratefully acknowledged. The Spring 1965 issue had an article on the original Dublin Magazine by Rudi Holzapfel, with several illustrations, among them two captioned respectively as the front covers of the first Dublin Magazine (August 1923) and the last (April–June 1958). The magazine continued for six years until 1969 under the joint editorship before it was taken on by John Ryan.

The Dublin Magazine was re-issued from 1970–75 by John Ryan.

In 2006, the Honorary Secretary of the Trinity College Dublin Association, Cambridge Branch, asked Rivers Carew to reminisce on his days with The Dublin Magazine at the Association&#x27;s July meeting. He recalled how in the early 1960s a number of talented young poets then appearing on the scene were published by The Dublin Magazine such as Eavan Boland, Brendan Kennelly, Michael Longley and Derek Mahon who were all TCD graduates and went on to become highly regarded figures in the literary world. Some also had distinguished academic careers. Particularly noteworthy among the budding poets whose work appeared in the magazine was Seamus Heaney, the eventual Nobel Prize winner. Rivers Carew claimed that he and Timothy Brownlow wanted the magazine to be neither radical nor a staid organ of academe; its main purpose was to offer a platform for talented young writers, and the later achievements of the poets and others who were published show that it succeeded in that aim. The magazine was supported by the Irish Arts Council, by advertisers and members of the public &quot;who had little or no reason to regret their interest or their generosity&quot;.

<text>Gopeng (Jawi: ڬوڤيڠ, Chinese: ) is a town located in Mukim Teja, Kampar District, Perak, Malaysia. It is situated approximately south of Ipoh, the state capital.

==History==

Gopeng was the most important town in the Kinta Valley until 1890, when Ipoh became more prominent. Gopeng was intensively mined by both European and Chinese miners, the latter having significant Hakka representation under Chung Keng Kwee, the leader of the Hai San secret society during the Larut War. He was appointed as the Kapitan Cina after the Pangkor Treaty, and although his main homes were in Taiping and Penang, he maintained his foothold in Gopeng, securing contracts for street lighting there in 1892 as well as building quarters for civil servants thereafter. For the first few decades after British intervention, Gopeng was run by a tripartite; the Europeans, the Chinese led by the Eu family, and the Sumatrans by the Assistant Penghulu Imam Prang Ja Barumun. Gopeng is also one of the first places where large numbers of Orang Asli came into contact with outsiders in the 19th century.

He is best known for his roles as Atreyu in the 1984 film &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; and for portraying Boxey on the original television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. His work in &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; made him particularly popular as a teen idol in Europe.

==Career==
===Early work===
Hathaway was born in Los Angeles, California. He began appearing in commercials at age three, and later starred in several TV films and series, including an episode of &quot;Family Ties&quot;, episode 4 of season 4 called “Designated Hitter.” At the age of six he appeared in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, portraying Boxey, for which he received a nomination in the first Young Artist Awards.

He was cast as Atreyu in the 1984 film &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;. He received his second Young Artist Awards nomination and won the award for Best Younger Actor in the 12th Annual Saturn Awards.

For the role Hathaway performed his own stunts, leading to a few near-injuries; German director Wolfgang Petersen said: 

Hathaway observed:
Hathaway has said that, during the time he worked as a tattoo artist, he could see for himself the film&#x27;s on-going popularity, as clients regularly requested tattoos of the AURYN amulet his character wore, in the film. He claims to have given fifteen different clients AURYN amulet tattoos in three weeks.

===Later roles===
In 1986, Hathaway starred in &quot;Troll&quot;, as Harry Potter Jr., and in the television movie &quot;Casebusters&quot;, as Jamie. Hathaway did not return to acting until 1994, in the film &quot;To Die, to Sleep&quot;, in his first adult role. After a second hiatus as an actor, Hathaway returned in 2011 for the films &quot;Mondo Holocausto!&quot; as Ruggero Margheriti, and &quot;Sushi Girl&quot; as Fish.

In 2016, Hathaway reprised his role from &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; for a Spotify commercial celebrating the 1980s.

==Personal life==

Hathaway attended school at Lycée Français de Los Angeles. He moved into dance instruction, teaching advanced jazz and street dance until an injury forced him to quit in 1989 at age eighteen. Trained in martial arts, Hathaway would later earn black belts in Tang Soo Do and Shotokan Karate, and also competed as a Muay Thai boxer, and learned American Kenpo from Dr. Jerry Erickson. Hathaway spent some of his time at the Willow Springs Raceway in Rosamond, California competing in supersport motorcycle racing, and designing and riding &quot;chopper&quot; motorcycles.

<text>Of Freaks and Men () is a 1998 Russian historical comedy-drama film directed by Aleksei Balabanov.

== Synopsis ==
In the beginning of the twentieth century, two seemingly prosperous families become associated with the mysterious Johann, the owner of a photo studio, in the basement of which a certain photographic theater honouring the Marquise de Sade was created. Photographic postcards are produced with the humbled nakedness of the human body, causing lust and gloating triumph of power. Johann has the look of a photographer who knows how to see angel curls and a sweet smile in a girl, and the same look that corrupts the body, the look of a pornographer. Over and over again, Johann destroys the well-being of families and turns ordinary people into freaks, seized with vice.

==Premise==
Filmed initially in black and white, then entirely in sepia tone, this film set in turn of the century Russia is centered on two families and their decline at the hands of one man, Johann, and his pornographic endeavours. Hailed by some as a masterpiece, the movie comments on the decline of Russian society as a result of the rise of capitalism.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack is taken from Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet, Romeo and Juliet; and Mussorgsky&#x27;s Pictures at an Exhibition.

==Awards==
At the 1998 Russian Guild of Film Critics Awards the picture was awarded the prizes for &quot;Best Director&quot; (Alexei Balabanov), &quot;Best Director of Photography&quot; (Sergei Astakhov), &quot;Best Art Direction&quot; (Vera Zelinskaya), &quot;Best Male Actor&quot; (Sergei Makovetsky) and &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; (Maksim Sukhanov).

At the Nika Awards the film received the prizes for &quot;Best Film&quot; and &quot;Best Director&quot; (Alexei Balabanov).

<doc id="844370" wikidata="Q7457028" url="?curid=844370" title="Seumas O'Sullivan">
<text>Seumas or Seamus O&#x27;Sullivan (born James Sullivan Starkey; 17 July 1879 – 24 March 1958) was an Irish poet and editor of &quot;The Dublin Magazine&quot;. His father, William Starkey (1836–1918), a physician, was also a poet and a friend of George Sigerson. He was born in Dublin and spent his adult life in the suburb of Rathgar. In 1926, he married the artist Estella Solomons, sister of Bethel Solomons. Her parents were opposed to the marriage as Seumas was not Jewish.

His books include &quot;Twilight People&quot; (1905), &quot;Verses Sacred and Profane&quot; (1908), &quot;The Earth Lover&quot; (1909), &quot;Selected Lyrics&quot; (1910), &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1912), &quot;Requiem&quot; (1917), &quot;Common Adventures&quot; (1926), &quot;The Lamplighter&quot; (1929), &quot;Personal Talk&quot; (1936), &quot;Poems&quot; (1938), &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1940), and &quot;Dublin Poems&quot; (1946). Terence de Vere White praised him as &quot;a true poet&quot;, and was critical of W. B. Yeats for leaving him out of his anthology of Irish poets, which he thought a particularly strange decision since Yeats and O&#x27;Sullivan were friends, although they quarrelled from time to time. In 1936 a version of a play by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy called &quot;The King of Spain&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was included in &quot;The Dublin Magazine&quot; which was edited by O&#x27;Sullivan.

Seumas O&#x27;Sullivan and B.J. Brimmer Company were accredited within the &#x27;Acknowledgments&#x27; of &quot;People and Music&quot; by Thomasine C. McGehee – published by Allyn and Bacon in the Junior High School Series, edited by James M. Glass, 1929 and 1931 respectively – for both (the frontispiece) &quot;In Mercer Street&quot; and the excerpt from &quot;Ballad of a Fiddler&quot; (page 93).

He had a great admiration for Patrick Kavanagh, and in the 1940s he was one of the very few Irish editors who was prepared to publish his poetry.

O&#x27;Sullivan was a friend of most of the leading literary figures in Dublin, including William Butler Yeats, James Stephens and George William Russell. His &quot;at homes&quot; on Sunday afternoons were a leading feature of Dublin literary life, as were Russell&#x27;s Sunday evenings and Yeats&#x27;s Monday evenings. He was inclined to be quarrelsome, due to his heavy drinking: on one occasion he insulted James Stephens publicly at a literary dinner. Even the kind-hearted Russell admitted that &quot;Seumas drinks too much&quot;; Yeats&#x27; verdict was that &quot;the trouble with Seumas is that when he&#x27;s not drunk, he&#x27;s sober&quot;.

==Musical settings==
O&#x27;Sullivan was also friendly with the composer E J Moeran, whose &quot;Six Poems by Seumas O&#x27;Sullivan&quot; (1944) is his most substantial solo vocal work, and arguably his finest. Moeran also published &#x27;Invitation in autumn&#x27; (1943) as a separate song. With its straightforward language and direct imagery, his poetry was attractive to composers, particularly his most popular poem &#x27;The Piper&#x27; (&#x27;A piper in the streets today&#x27;) which was set by Peter Crossley-Holland, Michael Head, Ivor Gurney, Norman Peterkin and Vaughan Williams.

<text>The Celtic Warriors () were a rugby union team from Wales, who played in the 2003–04 Celtic League and the 2003–04 Heineken Cup following the introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales. They were effectively a temporary merger of Pontypridd RFC and Bridgend RFC. The Celtic Warriors played just one season before disbanding.

==History==
The Celtic Warriors were one of the five original Welsh regional rugby sides. They were established in the summer of 2003 when the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) controversially elected to reduce the top tier of professional rugby in the country from nine clubs to five regions, attempting to mirror the successful formats of rugby union in Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Officially representing the Mid Glamorgan area, including Merthyr Tydfil, Aberdare, Pontypridd, Caerphilly, Maesteg and Bridgend, as well as south Powys, in practice the Celtic Warriors were a combination of two Welsh Premier Division clubs: Pontypridd RFC and Bridgend RFC. With Bridgend RFC having clinched the 2002–03 Welsh Premier League title and Pontypridd RFC performing consistently well in domestic rugby, the Warriors were considered one of the strongest line-ups of the five Welsh regions.

However, problems dogged the region from the very start, as they similarly did with the other merged regions of the Neath–Swansea Ospreys and the Newport Gwent Dragons. Discussions and arguments abounded about the team name, colours and home grounds for most of the summer of 2003. The team originally adopted the name &quot;RCT Ravens&quot;, reflecting the region&#x27;s primary location in the county of Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and Bridgend RFC&#x27;s nickname, the Ravens; however, this name was rejected because Bridgend is not in Rhondda Cynon Taf and Pontypridd supporters objected to the inclusion of Bridgend&#x27;s nickname. That name was dropped in June 2003, and other names, including &quot;Crusaders&quot;, &quot;Glamorgan Gladiators&quot; and &quot;Glamorgan Celts&quot;, were also rejected, before settling on the Celtic Warriors name in July 2003. In response to the branding issues, as well as the structure of the region&#x27;s board, Bridgend RFC owner Leighton Samuel resigned as chairman of the Warriors board.
Originally, the team decided to play an equal number of games at Bridgend&#x27;s Brewery Field and Pontypridd&#x27;s Sardis Road, ahead of plans to build a new stadium for the Warriors in either Treforest or Llantrisant, financed by the sale of Brewery Field. However, Pontypridd RFC went into administration in October 2003 with debts of £670,000, leading to the sale of their half of the Warriors to Samuel, which he in turn gave to the WRU. In November 2003, they also made the decision to play all future Warriors games at Brewery Field, due in part to the extra revenue brought in by the 16 hospitality boxes at the Bridgend ground, though they did play one more game at Sardis Road at the start of April 2004.

Financial difficulties at the Warriors led to talks of a merger with the Cardiff Blues, but these were quashed in January 2004. In March 2004, Samuel announced that he would be withdrawing his financial backing for Bridgend RFC to focus entirely on the Warriors. Two months later, it emerged that Samuel had agreed to sell his remaining 50% share of the Warriors to the WRU; however, on 19 May 2004, Samuel claimed that he had withdrawn the offer to sell the region, after the WRU missed his deadline of 14:00 to complete the purchase. The WRU counter-claimed that no deadline had been set and that the funds had been transferred to Samuel by 14:45 that day, making them 100% shareholders of the Warriors. Samuel ultimately accepted that the WRU had bought his share of the team, but that he would be challenging the sale on the basis that the WRU had misrepresented their intention to keep the Warriors going. Despite claims that the team would continue for at least another season, it was expected that the union would dissolve the Warriors, following a review by WRU chief executive David Moffett, leaving just four regional sides in Wales. The Warriors&#x27; players were then divided among the four remaining teams, and the club was put into liquidation on 1 June 2004.

Samuel first brought his legal challenge against the WRU in October 2004, also claiming that he was owed £1.75 million from the sale and in repayment of a &quot;significant financial contribution&quot; made by his company Décor Frame Ltd, and proceedings began in the High Court in April 2005. That June, Samuel was accused of making a death threat against a WRU lawyer, but no case was ever brought. In July 2005, the WRU wrote to Bridgend RFC, threatening to sue for over £200,000 owed by the club if they lost the Warriors case; however, the case was ultimately settled in October 2006 without having to go to court.

==Aftermath==

With the demise of the club, players&#x27; contracts were effectively torn up as they were pushed around to fill positions in the other four regional sides. A number simply chose to turn their back on the Welsh game and moved to teams in England and France. This left the ex-Warriors&#x27; fans feeling alienated from the professional game.

In the aftermath of the demise of the Warriors, a new rugby league club Celtic Crusaders was formed and played at Brewery Field. They were funded by Leighton Samuel, who claimed that they were the reincarnation of the Warriors franchise. The club lasted four seasons in Bridgend before relocating to Wrexham under new ownership.

==Home ground==
The Warriors used both Brewery Field and Sardis Road for their home games.

<text>Carl Theodor Albrecht (August 30, 1843, Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony – August 31, 1915) was a German astronomer.

He studied mathematics and natural sciences at the TU Dresden and the Universität Berlin. During his time in Dresden, he helped founding &quot;Polyhymnia&quot;, the fraternity that later became the German Student Corps Altsachsen.
He specialized in geodesy, to which he devoted much of his career. He also worked on the problem of variation of latitude, building upon the work of Seth Carlo Chandler who discovered the variation, known as the Chandler wobble. In 1882, Carl Theodor Albrecht was elected as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

<doc id="844394" wikidata="Q3557672" url="?curid=844394" title="Victoria (British Columbia federal electoral district)">
<text>Victoria is a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1872 to 1904 and since 1925.

The riding was originally chartered as Victoria District for the special byelections held in 1871 upon the province&#x27;s entry into Confederation. Like the other B.C. ridings with that appellation, however, the &quot;District&quot; was dropped once the temporary ridings were ratified and made &quot;permanent&quot; for the general election of 1872; this was the first in which the Victoria riding (by that name) appeared. From 1905 up until the 1925 election, Victoria was represented by the riding of Victoria City.

==Demographics==
Ethnic groups (2006): 85.54% White, 4.05% Chinese, 3.07% Aboriginal, 1.26% South Asian, 1.22% Japanese, 1.15% Filipino, 1.09% Black 
Languages (2011): 83.93% English, 2.92% Chinese, 1.79% French, 1.40% German 
Religions (2001): 35.36% Protestant, 15.05% Catholic, 3.94% Other Christian, 1.62% Buddhist, 40.52% No religion
Median income (2005): $24,022

==Geography==
It covers the entire city of Victoria, the municipality of Oak Bay and the southeastern portion of the municipality of Saanich. It also includes the University of Victoria.

==History==
This electoral district was created in 1872 when Victoria District riding was abolished. It elected two members to the House of Commons of Canada through Block voting. Of the two it elected in 1872, one (Henry Nathan Jr.) was the first Jewish MP of Canada; the other (William Alexander &quot;Amor De Cosmos&quot; Smith) served as MP while also serving as premier of British Columbia.

In 1878, Sir John A. Macdonald was parachuted into the riding, as he was unelectable in eastern Canada, in the wake of the Pacific Scandal. Macdonald, previously the MP for the Marquette riding in Manitoba, had to run in a by-election as he had been appointed to the cabinet (to serve as prime minister). He chose Victoria, which had not yet held its portion of the 1878 Canadian federal election. Victorians voted for him enthusiastically, as he promised to finally bring about the construction of what became the Canadian Pacific Railway. He did not run for re-election in Victoria, instead securing a safe seat in Ontario in 1882.

It was abolished in 1903, and its territory was divided between the new single-member ridings of Victoria City and Nanaimo.

It was re-created in 1924 from the Victoria City riding, electing one member to the House of Commons.

A redistribution in 1966 trimmed the size of the riding slightly, removing parts of Saanich west of Cedar Hill Road and north of Cedar Hill Cross Road.

Victoria was one of two electoral districts in British Columbia that saw no changes to its boundaries proposed following the 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution.

<text>Varning för Jönssonligan () is a Swedish film about the gang Jönssonligan made in 1981.

It was the first Swedish adaptation of one of the original Danish &quot;Olsen-banden&quot; movies. Somewhat ironically, it was based on the sixth Olsen Gang movie, &quot;Olsen-bandens sidste bedrifter&quot;, which was intended as the last one when it was made.

<text>Elasmucha grisea, common name parent bug, is a species of shield bugs or stink bugs belonging to the family Acanthosomatidae. The term parent bugs includes also the other species of the genus &quot;Elasmucha&quot; and some species of the family Acanthosomatidae.

==Subspecies==
Subspecies within &quot;Elasmucha grisea&quot; include:
* &quot;Elasmucha grisea cypria&quot; Josifov, 1971
* &quot;Elasmucha grisea grisea&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758)

==Distribution==
&quot;Elasmucha grisea&quot; is a rather common and widespread species present in most of Europe.

==Description==
&quot;Elasmucha grisea&quot; can reach a length of . Males are smaller than females. These medium-sized shield bugs are usually brown-reddish, but there are also gray (hence the Latin species name &quot;grisea&quot;) and green-brown specimens. The connexiva are black and white. The upper side is covered with several dark dots. The scutellum usually shows an evident black patch. The ventral face is largely punctuated with black. The lateral corners of the pronotum are simply beveled. The front corners of the pronotum show a more pronounced tooth. Antennae are blackish in the male, dark brown in the female.

This species, like other parent bugs, possesses metathoracic and abdominal glands, which discharge a foul smelling secretion. This secretion is used to deter potential enemies and is sometimes released when the bug is disturbed.

==Life cycle==
Adults of &quot;E. grisea&quot; can be found all year around. In fact this species overwinters as an adult. Mating occurs in the spring and new adults can be found in August. These shield bugs feed on various woody plants, preferably on birch (&quot;Betula&quot; sp.), but also on alder (&quot;Alnus&quot; sp.), beech (&quot;Fagus&quot; sp.), holly (&quot;Ilex&quot; sp.), spruce (&quot;Picea&quot; sp.), etc. Like most shield bugs, &quot;E. grisea&quot; and other parent bugs suck plant sap and require symbiotic bacteria for their digestion. They obtain symbionts at an early age: the mother covers her eggs with bacteria so that the nymphs ingest them as they feed on the egg case. Both adults and nymphs readily feed on developing seeds, and breeding individuals can be observed on host plants with many young catkins. However, they seem to avoid trees with a high predation risk.

==Parental care==

The common name of &quot;parent bug&quot; comes from the relatively rare insect behaviour of prolonged caring for eggs and juveniles, exhibited by females of this species. Predators, such as bugs, beetles, earwigs and ants, can eliminate all the offspring of the parent bug if there is no maternal care. The repertoire of female defensive behaviours includes wing fanning, body jerking, tilting towards the enemy and, finally, releasing of &#x27;nasty&#x27; odours from the scent glands,

After oviposition, the parent bug female stands over the egg batch and shields it throughout egg development. Predation appears to limit the clutch size in &quot;E. grisea&quot;. Experiments have shown that large females lay larger egg clutches than small females. However, when the clutch size was manipulated, small females protecting large clutches lost significantly more eggs than large females guarding small clutches or females in the control groups (guarding clutches of optimal size).

After hatching, larvae of the parent bug remain in a tight aggregation, feeding on their empty egg shells. When any larva tries to abandon the aggregation, the female tilts her body, stretches her antennae to reach the larva and pushes the larva back to the aggregation. During the second and third instar they move, for food, towards catkins then back to the leaf with the female in close attendance. The female keeps a lookout for the larvae constantly and manages them with touches of her antennae. Finally, larvae form smaller groups and disperse at the end of the third instar, at which point the female leaves them.
It has been noted that, in &quot;E. grisea&quot;, moultings during the early instar stages can be asynchronous. While some larvae are still at the first instar stage, others have already moulted to the stage of second instar larvae and abandon the brood leaf for food. Under such circumstances, the female is no longer able to provide effective protection for all her larvae. The offspring of different females make contact with each other and form mixed groups. There is no kin-recognition in this species. Both single and joint guarding females provide parental care for their own larvae or other females&#x27; offspring. Larvae are likely to benefit from &#x27;kindergartens&#x27;, when their mothers disappear or die. Moreover, joint-guarding females defend the egg clutches much more successfully than single females.

The tachinid fly, &quot;Subclytia rotundiventris&quot;, is a specialist endoparasite of the parent bug females. The parasite inserts a single egg through the upper prothorax of an &quot;E. grisea&quot; female and, after hatching, the larva feeds on its host. At the beginning the parasite feeds only on the non-vital parts of the bug, but finally it kills it and pupates outside the host. The larva ‘permits’ the parent bug to continue caring for the juveniles until their third stage. In experiments, the wing-fanning (regarded as the most effective defensive behaviour of the parent bug) did not differ significantly between parasited and non-parasited females until the nymphs were at the second instar stage. However, with older nymphs, females were much less effective in their defensive behaviour and often died before the end of maternal care. Considering that the older nymphs are more mobile and may escape from predators, some offspring of the parasited females of the parent bug probably survive and may also be potential hosts for the new generation of the parasite.

<text>David Thomas Bronconnier (born October 7, 1962) is a Canadian politician who served as the 35th Mayor of Calgary, Alberta.

== Personal life ==
A fourth-generation Calgarian (his great grandmother was born in Calgary in 1895), he grew up in the southwest community of Glenbrook and attended Viscount Bennett High School. Bronconnier enrolled at the University of Calgary but left after a short while to pursue work opportunities. He worked for the City of Calgary Electric System and for Alberta Government Telephones and then in 1983, started a small construction company. In 1987, Bronconnier and his business partner founded First General Services, a company which specializes in various types of insurance restoration in buildings. The firm has grown substantially since then. Dave is married to Cindy Bronconnier, with whom he has four children; Adam, Weston, Leslie and Grant.

== Political career ==
Bronconnier served on Calgary&#x27;s city council as the alderman for Ward 6 for nine years. He was first elected in 1992 and then served 3 terms before deciding to run for mayor. In 1997, Bronconnier ran in the federal election as the Liberal candidate for Calgary West. Bronconnier was defeated by a landslide in this election by Reform Party candidate Rob Anders. Long serving and very popular mayor Al Duerr was retiring leaving the position open. Bronconnier narrowly defeated Bev Longstaff, Duerr&#x27;s protégé, winning the mayoralty race of 2001. He became Calgary&#x27;s 35th mayor.

Bronconnier was re-elected in 2004 with nearly 80% of the votes. Only 18% of the population voted, making it the lowest voter turnout for a municipal election in Western Canada. He campaigned for re-election in the 2007 Calgary municipal election and was re-elected with 61% of the votes.

On February 23, 2010, Bronconnier announced that he would not seek reelection in the 2010 municipal election. He was among the finalists for the 2010 World Mayor prize.

In November 2011, Bronconnier was named by Premier Alison Redford to be Alberta&#x27;s trade commissioner in Washington, D.C. for a nine-month term.

==Mayoralty==

===Environmental leadership===
Mounting international, domestic, and celebrity criticism of Alberta&#x27;s underdeveloped green technology infrastructure prompted former Premier Ed Stelmach&#x27;s government to commit 4 billion CAD to a province-wide green capital projects plan in 2009.

In 2009 Bronconnier and Pembina Institute was awarded at the &quot;UN Climate Change Summit&quot; with the &#x27;Reaching Out to Global Energy Award&#x27; for the technical and engineering collaboration with Calgary&#x27;s &#x27;Greening the Grid program&#x27;. city consulted with Pembina for technical advice. Pembina scholars compiled the &quot;Options for Reducing GHG Emissions in Calgary&quot; to advise the city on how to implement infrastructure projects for environmental protection. The city acted on these recommendations through city-owned company Enmax decided on a series of public works facilities such as the &#x27;Shepard Energy Center&#x27;, and a 12-turbine wind farm that supplies wind power for Calgary Transit&#x27;s C-trains, and the District Energy Centre, a heat capture energy plant providing heat and energy for the downtown core. The city publication of the &#x27;Greening the Grid&#x27; was entitled &#x27;Calgary Climate Change Action Plan: Target (down arrow) 50&#x27; (Target Minus 50)

The &#x27;Greening the Grid&#x27; program&#x27;s objectives are to empower city facilities by renewable sources by 2012. Calgary Transit&#x27;s C-trains&#x27; electrical needs were partially provided by wind power in 2001, by 2009 the inception year of &#x27;Greening the Grid&#x27;, the C-train were fully empowered by &#x27;Ride the Wind&#x27; a program launched by Enmax and wind power engineers &#x27;Vision Quest Windlectric. committed 250 million CAD on the &#x27;Greening the grid&#x27; program.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-47 &quot;Berkut&quot; () (NATO reporting name Firkin), also designated S-32 and S-37 during initial development, was a Russian experimental supersonic jet fighter developed by the JSC Sukhoi Company. A distinguishing feature of the aircraft was its forward-swept wing which gave the aircraft excellent agility and maneuverability. While serial production of the type never materialized and the configuration was not further pursued, the sole aircraft produced served as a technology demonstrator prototype for a number of advanced technologies later used in the fourth-generation fighter Su-35 and the fifth-generation fighter Su-57.

==Development==
Originally known as the S-37, Sukhoi redesignated its advanced test aircraft as the Su-47 in 2002. Officially nicknamed Berkut () (the Russian word for the golden eagle), the Su-47 was originally built as Russia&#x27;s principal testbed for composite materials and sophisticated fly-by-wire control systems, as well as new airframe technologies.

TsAGI has long been aware of the advantages of forward-swept wings, with research including the development of the Tsibin LL and study of the captured Junkers Ju 287 in the 1940s. At high angles of attack, the wing tips remain retracted allowing the aircraft to retain aileron control. Conversely to more conventional rear-swept wings, forward sweep geometrically creates increased angle of incidence of the outer wing sections when the wing bends under load. The wings experience higher bending moments, leading to a tendency for the wings to fail structurally at lower speeds than for a straight or aft-swept wing.

The project was launched in 1983 on order from the Soviet Air Force. But when the USSR dissolved, funding was frozen and development continued only through funding by Sukhoi. Like its US counterpart, the Grumman X-29, the Su-47 was primarily a technology demonstrator for future Russian fighters such as the Sukhoi Su-57. The forward-swept wing configuration was ultimately not pursued because it was mainly advantageous at transonic speeds while an aft-swept wing was superior at supersonic speeds.
The Su-47 is of similar dimensions to previous large Sukhoi fighters, such as the Su-35. To reduce development costs, the Su-47 borrowed the forward fuselage, vertical tails, and landing gear of the Su-27 family. Nonetheless, the aircraft includes an internal weapons bay, and space set aside for an advanced radar.

Like its immediate predecessor, the Su-37, the Su-47 is of tandem-triple layout, with canards ahead of wings and tailplanes. The Su-47 has two tailbooms of unequal length outboard of the exhaust nozzles, carrying rearward-facing radar and a breaker-chute.

===Maneuverability===
The Su-47 has extremely high agility at subsonic speeds, enabling the aircraft to alter its angle of attack and its flight path very quickly while retaining maneuverability in supersonic flight.

The forward-swept wings give the Su-47 an unconventional appearance. The inner portion of the wing generates a substantial part of the lift. This lift is not restricted by wingtip stall, and the lift-induced wingtip vortex generation is thus reduced. The aileron remain effective at the highest angles of attack, and controllability of the aircraft is retained even in the event of airflow separating from the remainder of the wings&#x27; surface.

A disadvantage of such a forward-swept wing design is that it twists when under load, resulting in greater stress on the wing than occurs with a similar straight or aft-swept wing. This requires the wing be designed to twist as it bends—opposite to the geometric twisting. This is done by the use of composite wing skins laid-up to twist. The aircraft was initially limited to Mach 1.6. Because the forward sweep was primarily beneficial at transonic speed while losing out to aft-swept wing at supersonic speed, it was not pursued further.

===Thrust vectoring===
The thrust vectoring (with PFU engine modification) of ±20° at 30°/second in pitch and yaw would have greatly supported the agility gained by other aspects of the design.

===Stealth===
According to some sources, the Su-47 was treated with radar absorbent material (RAM) in order to reduce its radar signature. However, the airframe itself has no specific features characteristic of true stealth aircraft that would more significantly reduce its radar cross-section.

<text>José Apolonio Burgos y García (February 9, 1837 – February 17, 1872) was a Filipino Catholic priest, accused of mutiny by the Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines in the 19th century. He was tried and executed in Manila along with two other clergymen, Mariano Gomez and Jacinto Zamora, who are collectively known as the Gomburza.

==Early life==
José Burgos, baptized José Apolonio Burgos y García, was born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur on February 9, 1837, to a Spanish officer, Don José Tiburcio Burgos y Calderón, and a Filipino mestiza mother named Florencia García. He obtained three undergraduate degrees with honors, two master&#x27;s degrees and two doctorate degrees from the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and from the University of Santo Tomas. He conducted his first mass in Intramuros.

==Contributions==
Burgos&#x27; nationalist views, codified in editorial essays, championing political and ecclesiastic reforms in favor of empowering more native clergymen, made him a target of opposition to civil authorities.

He received these degrees while acting as a curate of the Parish of St. Peter which comprised the Walled City. Having taken all these courses, he became a member of the examining board for priests. 

His studies finished and having passed a competitive examination to secure an office in the Manila Cathedral, he was ordained second priest of the Cathedral, Fiscal of the Ecclesiastical Court, and Professor and Master of Ceremonies of the University of Santo Tomas.

Young Filipinos studied serving mustering ground for national unity in the schools in the city of Manila. They are the one who encouraged the spread of education which led to the formation of an intelligent middle class. Sooner, these Filipinos became the leaders of the movement for the reform and greater participation in the government. In that time there were two group of leaders: the laymen and the priests. The laymen were composed of businessmen, lawyers, physicians, and proprietors where in, they desired to end all legislation that discriminated the Filipinos. While the priests, they bonded together so as to achieve reforms.

The overall demand for reform at the time had its religious just as its political aspects, and under the initiative of Father Burgos, the local church started to demand their equitable rights and to demand that duly trained secular priests, the greater part of whom were locals and who were oppressed by the religious authorities, be again allowed to hold areas, a right they had once delighted in, yet which had been removed. Father Burgos thusly made ground-breaking adversaries among the friars.

As a beholder to the evil treatment and apathy manifested by the Spanish clerical authorities to his comrades, Burgos felt oppressed. In spite of his enviable positions, he was neither substance nor glad. To battle the injustice, he turned into a resolute and incredible backer for changes in the nation and a solid crusader for the rights and government assistance of the mainstream pastorate.

In 1864, an anonymous pamphlet was published in Manila, criticizing the prejudice in the Church, and providing rebuttals against several canards against the native clergy. Although the document was unsigned, historians believe the author to be Burgos, based on its style and content. Burgos also penned several signed articles later in his life, in response to a series of anonymous written attacks on the Filipino clergy. Though Burgos offered few new ideas, his name caught the attention of Spanish authorities, who would report that the native clergy was becoming separatist.

In 1869, Felipé Buencamino, a young student and an acquaintance of Burgos, was charged with spreading nationalist propaganda in the form of leaflets scattered throughout his school&#x27;s campus, demanding academic freedom. This accusation was given credence by a protest he staged several months prior in opposition to being required to speak Latin in classes. Consequently, Buencamino and some of his associates were sent to jail. With the aid of Burgos, Buencamino was freed four months later, only to be told that having missed school for four months, he would have to find a tutor who would help him make up for the classes he missed. Buencamino chose Burgos.

By this time, Burgos had established a reputation as a defender of the native clergy. His debates over the rights of native priests had extended to include questions of race and nationalism. This reputation would eventually cause him to be implicated in a mutiny in Cavite.

==Secret Society of Reformers==
José Burgos was a member of a confraternity, which met in the Santa Cruz home of Padre Mariano. It was presided over by José María Basa, and included Agustín Mendoza, Máximo Paterno, and Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista. The group&#x27;s goal was to seek reforms, listed in &quot;Eco de Filipinas&quot;, which was published in Madrid. He founded the newspaper of &quot;La Nacion&quot; (The Spanish Nation), this is publication served when the voice of Filipino Propaganda where eager devoted high degree against the Spanish colonizers , however expose to abuse the Liberal Spanish government in Secularism of Insulares y Indios. 

==Death==

After the Cavite Mutiny on January 20, 1872, the trial of mutineer sergeant Bonifacio Octavo revealed that a man named Zaldua had been recruiting people for an uprising. Octavo testified that this man claimed to be under the orders of Burgos, but inconsistent details during Octavo&#x27;s cross-examinations called into question the validity of his testimony. Nevertheless, governor-general Rafael Izquierdo reported to Madrid that the testimony had confirmed his suspicions, and pinned the blame on Burgos and two other priests, Jacinto Zamora and Mariano Gomez, for sedition.

On February 17, 1872, they were garroted in the middle of Bagumbayan field (now Luneta Park).
==Influence==
Burgos was a close friend and associate of Paciano Rizal, José Rizal&#x27;s older brother and mentor. Burgos&#x27;s execution - along with Gómez&#x27;s and Zamora&#x27;s - deeply affected José, who was inspired to write his second novel, El Filibusterismo.

Several towns in the Philippines were named in his honor. These include: 
* Burgos, Ilocos Norte
* Burgos, Ilocos Sur
* Burgos, Isabela
* Burgos, La Union
* Burgos, Pangasinan
* Padre Burgos, Quezon
* Padre Burgos, Southern Leyte
* Burgos, Surigao del Norte

==In popular culture==
* Portrayed by Toby Alejar in an episode of Bayani in 1996.
* Portrayed by Paolo Paraiso in the official music video of GMA Network&#x27;s production of &quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot; in 2010.

<text>Maritsa or Maritza ( ), also known as Evros ( ) and Meriç ( ), is a river that runs through the Balkans in Southeast Europe. With a length of , it is the longest river that runs solely in the interior of the Balkan peninsula, and one of the largest in Europe by discharge. It flows through Bulgaria in its upper and middle reaches, while its lower course forms much of the border between Greece and Turkey. Its drainage area is about , of which 66.2% is in Bulgaria, 27.5% in Turkey, and 6.3% in Greece. It is the main river of the historical region of Thrace, most of which lies in its drainage basin.

It has its origin in the Rila Mountains in Western Bulgaria, its source being the Marichini Lakes. The Maritsa flows east-southeast between the Balkan and Rhodope Mountains, past Plovdiv and Dimitrovgrad in Bulgaria to Edirne in Turkey. East of Svilengrad, Bulgaria, the river flows eastwards, forming the border between Bulgaria (on the north bank) and Greece (on the south bank), and then between Turkey and Greece. At Edirne, the river meets it two chief tributaries Tundzha and Arda, and flows through Turkish territory on both banks. It then turns towards the south and forms the border between Greece on the west bank and Turkey on the east bank all the way to the Aegean Sea, which it enters near Enez, forming a river delta. The upper Maritsa valley is a principal east–west route in Bulgaria. The unnavigable river is used for hydroelectric power generation and irrigation.

==Names==
The earliest known name of the river is (, Alcman, 7th–6th century BC). Proto-Indo-European and Ancient Greek meant &quot;wide&quot;. The Proto-Indo-European consonant cluster *&quot;-wr-&quot; shifted in Thracian to &quot;-br-&quot;, creating the Thracian name . Thereafter, the river began to be known as () in Greek and in Latin. Rather than an origin as &#x27;wide river&#x27;, an alternative hypothesis is that is borrowed from Thracian meaning &#x27;splasher&#x27;.

While the name () was used in Ancient Greek, the name () had become standard before the ancient form was restituted in Modern Greek as (now: ). The name may derive from a mountain near the mouth of the river known in antiquity as or , Latinized as .

==History==

In 1371, the river was the site of the Battle of Maritsa, also known as the battle of Chernomen, an Ottoman victory over the Serbian rulers Vukašin Mrnjavčević and Jovan Uglješa, who died in the battle.

After 1923, the river gained political significance as the modern border between Greece and Turkey. This was further bolstered by Greece joining the European Union in 1981 (and then the Schengen area), marking the river as an external boundary of the EU.

Since the 1990s, the river, as a natural barrier on the border between Turkey and Greece, has become a major route for migrants from a variety of countries attempting to enter the EU irregularly. Between 2000 and 2019, 398 bodies were found on the Greek side of the Maritsa/Evros river. Up until that time, drowning in the river was the leading cause of death among migrants trying to enter Greece. 

In February 2020, Turkey unilaterally opened its borders to Greece to allow refugees and migrants seeking refuge to reach the European Union, leading to the 2020 Greek–Turkish border crisis. In May 2020, news emerged that Turkish forces occupied of Greek territory, Melissokomeio, as shown on maps of 1923, following a change in the flow of the river. These crises passed following the improvement in Greek-Turkish relations in 2023, however, illegal migration is still a major issue.

==Tributaries==
Starting from the river&#x27;s source, significant tributaries of Maritsa include:
*Left tributaries:
**Topolnitsa (flows into Maritsa near Pazardzhik)
**Luda Yana (near Ognyanovo)
**Stryama (near Sadovo)
**Sazliyka (near Simeonovgrad)
**Tundzha/Tunca (in Edirne)
**Ergene (near İpsala)
*Right tributaries:
**Chepinska reka (near Septemvri)
**Vacha (near Stamboliyski)
**Chepelarska reka (near Sadovo)
**Harmanliyska reka (near Harmanli)
**Arda/Ardas (near Edirne)
**Erythropotamos/Luda reka (near Didymoteicho)

==Floods==
The lower course of the river Maritsa, where it forms the border between Greece and Turkey, is very vulnerable to flooding. For about 4 months every year, the low lands around the river are flooded. This causes significant economic damage (loss of agricultural production and damage to infrastructure), which is estimated at several hundreds million Euro.

Recent large floods have taken place in 2006, 2007, 2014, with the largest flood taking place in 2021. Several causes have been proposed, including more rainfall due to climate change, deforestation in the Bulgarian part of the catchment area, increased land use in the flood plains and difficult communication between the three countries.

==Trivia==
Maritsa Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Maritsa River.

&quot;La Maritza&quot; is also a 1968 song written by Jean Renard and Pierre Delanoë and interpreted by Sylvie Vartan.

Hebrus Valles on Mars is named after this river.

The Bulgarian Maritsa motorway, which roughly follows the course of the river from Chirpan (where it branches out of the Trakia motorway) to the Turkish border at Kapitan Andreevo, is also named in honour of the river.

<doc id="844433" wikidata="Q11106758" url="?curid=844433" title="Nazim Hussain Siddiqui">
<text>Nazim Hussain Siddiqui (Urdu: ; 30 June 1940 – 15 January 2022) a Pakistani jurist who served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, from 31 December 2003 to 29 June 2005.

== Life and career ==
Siddiqui was born on 30 June 1940. His father was Late Mukarram Hussain Siddiqui. He did his BA, LLB from the University of Hyderabad and LLM from the University of Karachi. He was the uncle of veteran Pakistani comedian and actor, Ayaz Khan.

Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqui took oath as the new Chief Justice of Pakistan soon after President Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s Constitutional Amendment which came to be known as the Seventeenth Amendment. Ten judges of the superior courts stood retired, including Supreme Court Chief Justice Sheikh Riaz Ahmad, who was replaced by Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqui.

==Famous cases==

===Case against Pervez Musharraf ===
As chief justice Siddiqui dismissed the constitutional petitions against General Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s uniform saying that the reasons for the decision would be told in the detailed judgment. Later Supreme Court of Pakistan announced a detailed judgement in 6 constitutional petitions regarding Seventeenth Amendment and said that this court must have due regard for the democratic mandate given to Parliament by the people.
The full bench of the Apex Court heard the case and announced short orders on 13 April 2005 after hearing the case for six days. However, it did say,
: &quot;It is not for this court to substitute its views for those expressed by legislators or strike down statutes on consideration of what it deems good for the people. This court is and always has been the judge of what is constitutional but not of what is wise or good. The latter is the business of Parliament, which is accountable to the people&quot;.

Former Chief Justice of Pakistan Nasim Hasan Shah giving his remarks in a TV program said that,
:&quot;The military holds the rifle and the court cannot go against the rifle&quot;.
Responding to that, Chief Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqui remarked that personal opinion of an individual could not be attributed to the whole judiciary.

===Shahbaaz Sharif&#x27;s return to Lahore===
As chief justice Siddiqui took the petition of former Punjab chief minister regarding permission to return to Pakistan. The court had issued notices to the federal government, the Punjab government and the director immigration for their comments on two petitions filed by Shahbaz Sharif. The short orders read,
: &quot;For reasons to be recorded later on, both these petitions are dismissed with an observation that the petitioner may come back from abroad subject to the law of the country.&quot;
The order also observed,
:&quot;During the course of argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is ready to face the cases registered against him. He also stated that the petitioner will not mind even if he is arrested at the airport.&quot;
Chief Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqui said that the petitioner, being a citizen of Pakistan, has a natural and inherent right to enter and return to the country, which is guaranteed under Article 15 of the Constitution. Under Article 4 of the Constitution, he has a right to be dealt with in accordance with law and is entitled to enjoy the equal protection of law.
However, Shahbaz Sharif was eventually not allowed to leave the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore by the government citing National Security issues and was boarded in a plane to leave Pakistan.

===Asif Ali Zardari===
Asif Ali Zardari had previously been granted bail in all but one of the cases outstanding against him, including conspiring to murder Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s brother, Mir Murtaza, in 1996. Pakistan&#x27;s Supreme Court granted bail of 1m rupees ($16,700) in the final corruption case against him - the alleged evasion of import duties on a car (BMW).

===Mukhtaran Mai rape case===
Mukhtaran Mai had attracted international attention when her name was put on the Exit Control List (ECL) and her passport was seized to discourage her from visiting the US on the invitation of the Asian-American Network Against Abuse of Human Rights (ANAA). She challenged a Lahore High Court order acquitting the 12 men accused of raping her on the orders of a tribal council. The Punjab government had also appealed the judgement in the apex court.

On 14 March 2005, the Supreme Court had intervened to end an inter-court controversy in the case by staying separate orders of the Lahore High Court and the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and deciding to hold its own hearing. The Supreme Court took up the issue when the FSC suspended the high court&#x27;s acquittal of the convicts, saying this was without jurisdiction.

Taking notice of the case, Chief Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqui had summoned the entire record of the case from the high court and the FSC, while notices were served on Punjab Advocate General Aftab Iqbal and Mukhtaran Mai. Bailable arrest warrants were also issued against the accused who have been rearrested on the directions of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said that he ordered that Mukhtaran be prevented from leaving as he didn&#x27;t want the country&#x27;s image tarnished.

===Other services===
Siddiqui served as the Chairman of Law &amp; Justice Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad;The Federal Judicial Academy, Islamabad; National Judicial, (Policy making) Committee;Al-Mizan Foundation.

He also visited France twice in connection with meetings of the Agha Khan University at Paris.

He represented Pakistan in the 1st &quot;UK-Pakistan Judicial Conference&quot; on Child and Family Laws held at London from 15 to 17 January 2003.

He participated in the 2nd &quot;UK-Pakistan Judicial Conference&quot; on Child and Family Laws held at Islamabad from 21 to 24 September 2003.

He hosted and chaired the 7th SAARC Chief Justices Conferences held at Karachi on 21 February 2004.
He is the only one in Pakistan and India who had started his journey from civil judge and ended his journey as Chief Justice of Pakistan.

He retired from service on 29 June 2005.

<text>The Nysa van was produced in the town of Nysa, Poland, from 1958 until 1994. The Nysa was based on the same chassis as the angular shaped Żuk van, but had rounded body lines, especially the two-part rounded windshield, and was considered more comfortable and a better fit for carrying people. The basic body variant was a universal van, for cargo or persons, with sliding doors on the right or conventional doors (marked with a letter T - ). At the rear, most variants had a single door opening to the left side.

A few variants existed: a cargo van (letter F - ), a minibus (letter M) and an ambulance (letter S), and some others. A rare variant was made in the form of a light truck. At the time, the Nysa was practically the only van-size ambulance used in Poland. Many vans were sold to the Militia, which was the only form of police during the Communist era in Poland; blue Nysa vans became a kind of &quot;trademark&quot; of the Militia (Militia variants had slide doors on both sides, most had also a two-part door at the rear).

The peak of its popularity was in the 1970s, with 18,200 made in 1978. In the 1980s the production decreased. When Poland became a democracy again in 1989 the future was bleak for the Nysa. Development work had been minimal for the past 20 years. Most customers, including the Police, chose more modern, faster and safer vans of Western manufacturers, that became widely imported instead. The production was closed in 1994, after manufacturing 380,575 vehicles.

Both Nysa and its sibling Żuk van were heavily based on the Warszawa, itself a licensed version of the Soviet GAZ-M20 Pobeda. Among others, it had the same wheelbase and engine. Its transmission and suspension were modified. Early variants of the Nysa were powered by the M20 petrol engine (R4 flathead, 2.12 L, 36.8 kW), most common was the newer S21 petrol engine (R4 OHV, 2.12l, 51.5 kW), used from 1964 onward. A big part of production was exported (in some years, 70%), mostly to Eastern Bloc countries, especially Bulgaria, Russia and Hungary, but also to West Germany and some Asian and African countries.

In Hungary Nysa vans were almost exclusively used as ambulance cars; 777 of them were in use in 1987.

In 1968 the front end styling was changed, and the most numerous model 521/522 entered production, which remained in a largely unchanged form until the end.
Nysa models included: N57 (1958), N58 (1958), N59, N60, N61, N63 (not produced), 501 (1964), 503 (not produced) and 521/522 (1968).

<text>The Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands is a U.S. naval facility and airport located five nautical miles (9 km) northwest of the central business district of Kekaha, in Kauai County, Hawaii, United States.

PMRF is the world&#x27;s largest instrumented, multi-dimensional testing and training missile range. The US military and its contractors favor its relative isolation, ideal year-round tropical climate and encroachment-free environment (see PMRF Agriculture Preservation Initiative below). It is the only range in the world where submarines, surface ships, aircraft and space vehicles can operate and be tracked simultaneously. There are over of instrumented underwater range and over of controlled airspace. The base itself covers roughly .

The base includes a runway with operations and maintenance facilities. It has roughly 70 housing units and various recreational facilities for those who can access the base.

The base has support facilities at Port Allen, Makaha Ridge, and Koke&#x27;e State Park. The base also uses a portion of the nearby island of Niihau for a remotely operated APS-134 surveillance radar, an Test Vehicle Recovery Site, the Perch Electronic Warfare site, multiple EW Portable Simulator sites, and a Helicopter Terrain Flight training course.

==History==
In 1921, the land area known as the Barking Sands was acquired by the Kekaha Sugar Company and became a runway for private planes. In 1928 Charles Kingsford Smith, a record-setting Australian aviator, took off with his four-man crew from a sandy runway here to fly non-stop to Fiji. They had arrived in Hawaii at Wheeler Army Airfield, but left from Barking Sands as Wheeler was not long enough to take off with their heavy load. The U.S. Army acquired the land in 1940, named it Mana Airport, and paved the runway. Additional land acquired in 1941 expanded the facility to . Private airlines frequently utilized the airport, and World War II incurred a great deal of military flight operations. The base was officially designated Bonham Air Force Base in 1954. U.S. Navy operations at Bonham began in 1956, with testing of the Regulus I missile. In 1958, the Pacific Missile Range Facility was established to support the growing demand of the Navy at Bonham. In 1964, the Pacific Missile Range Facility and Bonham was transferred to the Navy, becoming Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands.

==Missile tests==
In 1962, the U.S. military conducted the Frigate Bird Test of the Operation Dominic program near PMRF. The military launched an operational ballistic missile with a live warhead from the , which was situated near PMRF. The nuclear warhead flew toward Christmas Island and detonated in an air burst at .

The Navy is currently using PMRF to test &quot;hit to kill&quot; technology using direct collision of the anti-ballistic missile with its target. This destroys the target by using only kinetic energy from the force of the collision. The two Missile Defense Agency programs that currently utilize the range at PMRF are the Navy&#x27;s Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System and the Army&#x27;s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, or THAAD. The THAAD program relocated their testing operations from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and conducted its first demonstration at PMRF on 26 January 2007.

On 27 April 2007, the U.S. military&#x27;s sea-based missile defense system, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, showed it could intercept two targets simultaneously when it destroyed a cruise missile and a short-range ballistic missile during a test off the Hawaiian island of Kauai. The test marked eight out of ten times the Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy&#x27;s Aegis missile defense system successfully intercepted its target, but was the first time the system knocked out two targets at the same time.

==PMRF Agriculture Preservation Initiative==
The Navy is currently working with the State of Hawaii and Kauai County to ensure the long-term viability of PMRF. For many decades, the land adjacent to PMRF was used for sugarcane fields, which was wholly compatible with operations at PMRF. Since Kekaha Sugar&#x27;s closure, the Navy has become wary of &quot;encroachment&quot;, incompatible developments, that might occur on the land next to the base. In order to ensure that PMRF can continue to safely conduct important research and training operations in the future, the Navy and some citizens of Kauai are seeking to permanently preserve the land adjacent to PMRF for agricultural purposes. Under the PMRF Agriculture Preservation Initiative the Navy would have the roughly of land adjacent to PMRF preserved solely for agricultural use. Although the Navy has stated that it would like to lease about of land, it has also stated that its main goal is not to purchase more land but to merely ensure the land continues to be used for agricultural purposes.

==Operational deployment of THAAD==
When North Korea threatened to launch Taepodong-2 ICBMs toward Hawaii in 2009, the US temporarily deployed a THAAD missile unit to the facility.

<doc id="844444" wikidata="Q2083681" url="?curid=844444" title="Esperanza Aguirre">
<text>Esperanza Aguirre y Gil de Biedma (; born 3 January 1952) is a Spanish politician. As member of the People&#x27;s Party (PP), she served as President of the Senate between 1999 and 2002 (becoming the first female politician to have held the post), as President of the Community of Madrid between 2003 and 2012 and as Minister of Education and Culture (1996–1999). She also chaired the People&#x27;s Party of the Community of Madrid between 2004 and 2016.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Aguirre was born in Madrid on 3 January 1952 being the eldest daughter of José Luis Aguirre Borrell, a noted lawyer, and Piedad Gil de Biedma Vega de Seoane, the sister of the poet Jaime Gil de Biedma. She is also second cousin of the photographer Ouka Leele. She studied in the &quot;La Asunción&quot; School and in the British Council School of Madrid and earned a degree in Law at the Complutense University of Madrid in 1974. Aside from Spanish, she is reportedly fluent in English and French, has basic notions of Italian and &quot;understands&quot; Catalan.

In 1974, Aguirre married Fernando Ramírez de Haro, 15th Count of Murillo, 16th Count of Bornos (Grandee of Spain), whom with she has had two sons: Fernando (born 1976) and Álvaro (born 1980).

In 1976 Aguirre became a civil servant, as member of the Corps of Information of Tourism&#x27;s Technicians. She was head of the Department of Publicity and Tourism, where she remained until 1979. Subsequently, she had many different jobs in the Ministry of Culture, serving several Ministers during the Democratic Centre Union governments; especially designated by the Prime Minister himself. In 1979, she was chief of staff of the General Director of Literature and Cinematography. She was appointed Deputy General Director of Studies of the Technical General Secretariat of the Ministry of Culture in 1980. In 1981, she was appointed Deputy General Director in the Advisory Staff of the Secretary of State of Culture. Her last position with the Administration was as Deputy General Director of Cultural Associations.

=== First spell in local politics ===
Since her early years Aguirre had been a member of the Club Liberal of Madrid, which was presided over by Pedro Schwartz. Schwartz reportedly played an important role in the beginnings of Aguirre&#x27;s political career: in 1983, he was the one to convince her, by then a civil servant; to stand as candidate in the Madrid local elections running in the list of the political alliance between Schwartz&#x27;s Liberal Union, the People&#x27;s Alliance and the People&#x27;s Democratic Party. She was elected as became a municipal councillor. While in opposition, she was a member of the Standing Committee of the Madrid City Council, a CP spokeswoman on the areas of Culture, Education, Youth and Sports Affairs, and the Moncloa-Aravaca district. When the Liberal Union merged with the Liberal Party in December 1984, she held different positions in the National Executive and the Political Council of José Antonio Segurado&#x27;s Liberal Party.

In 1987 she left the Liberal Party and joined Popular Alliance, which later, in 1989, was refounded as the People&#x27;s Party (PP). She was subsequently re-elected to the city council and continued in opposition until 1989, when a successful vote of no confidence ousted the PSOE mayor Juan Barranco, which allowed the PP and Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) to govern Madrid for the first time since the restoration of competitive municipal elections in 1979, under the Mayorship of Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún (CDS). In the new local executive, she was designated head of the Department of the Environment.

The PP won a council majority in the 1991 election and José María Álvarez del Manzano was subsequently invested as new mayor, with Aguirre remaining in the municipal government board. Two years later, in 1993, in the reshuffle that followed the fall from grace of firebrand councillor Ángel Matanzo, she assumed additional competences becoming Councillor of Environment, Education, Culture and Sports. In June 1995, after the May election, she became the municipal spokeswoman of the PP and first deputy mayor. Soon after, she was also appointed by the City Council to the Caja Madrid Board of Governors.

=== Minister of Education, Culture and Sports ===

In the general election of 1996 she was the candidate for the Senate for Madrid of the People&#x27;s Party, after her designation as a member of the National Executive Committee of the Party; and she became a senator. The then new President, José María Aznar, appointed her to be Minister of Education, Culture and Sports. She was succeeded in those posts in 1999 by Mariano Rajoy.

=== President of the Senate ===
Aguirre, a Senator since 1996, was elected President of the Senate in February 1999, the first woman to do so. In March 2000, she was re-elected Senator for Madrid, becoming the top-voted candidate in Spain with 1.55 million votes and 50.7% of the popular vote, a percentage record still unbroken. She resigned in 2002 to run for the Presidency of the Autonomous Community of Madrid in the regional Assembly elections of 2003. She was substituted as President of the Senate by Juan José Lucas.

=== &quot;Tamayazo&quot; ===

When the regional elections took place in May 2003, the People&#x27;s Party won a plurality of seats. The People&#x27;s Party won 55 seats in the Madrid Assembly, being the only party of the right in the Assembly. On the left, PSOE won 47 seats and United Left won 9 seats, thus making it possible for a coalition of PSOE and IU to rule. However, the election of a leftist coalition was not possible due to two dissenting deputies of the PSOE, Eduardo Tamayo and María Teresa Sáez, who refused to obey the party whip in the first two votes, the election of the speaker and the election of the president. 

=== Presidency of the Community of Madrid ===

In October 2003, following the scandal of the dissenting deputies, the regional elections were rerun. The People&#x27;s Party won a qualified majority of seats, which enabled Aguirre&#x27;s investiture as President of the Community of Madrid. Aguirre&#x27;s most important stated achievements in those years were the reduction of surgery waiting times, the building of eight new hospitals and 87 new state schools (most of them bilingual), an increase in the investment for several scholarships of education, and the expansion of the Underground to suburban areas such as Pozuelo de Alarcón. The period included the peak of the Spanish construction bubble, and many of her associates would later end up indicted for corruption.

On 27 November 2008, she survived without injury the 2008 Mumbai attacks when shooting began in the Oberoi Trident while she was checking in.

Aguirre announced her retirement as president on 17 September 2012, citing health issues, and that she would return to her career as a civil servant at the Ministry of Tourism.

===Activity after her resignation as regional president ===
Aguirre remained as President of the People&#x27;s Party of the Community of Madrid. On 13 January 2013 the Seeliger and Conde Foundation, an executive search firm, announced the appointment of Esperanza Aguirre as Chairwoman of its Advisory Council, an office compatible with the role of Chairwoman of the People&#x27;s Party of the Community of Madrid.

=== Comeback to local politics ===

Designated in 2015 by Mariano Rajoy as the PP&#x27;s Mayoral candidate for the municipality of Madrid, she subsequently ran first in the PP&#x27;s list for the May 2015 Madrid municipal election. The PP&#x27;s list obtained a simple majority of 20 seats out of a total 57, short of the qualified majority needed to remain in government without support from other political parties. She then unsuccessfully pressed to reach a three-way deal between the PP, Citizens and the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) to avoid the investiture as Mayor&#x27;s of the candidate of the left-wing Ahora Madrid, Manuela Carmena, with the support of the PSOE&#x27;s municipal councillors. Soon after the investiture of Carmena as Mayor on 13 June 2015, Aguirre unsuccessfully proposed again another deal with Citizens and the PSOE to oust Carmena.

In 2016, Aguirre resigned from her position as regional party president, ostensibly due to the many corruption cases in the Madrilenian PP under her watch. She retained her position of opposition leader in the Madrid municipal government, and the overall maneuver was widely interpreted as a broadside against her party rival, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.

On 24 April 2017, she resigned as municipal councillor (and from all relating offices) after the imprisonment of her former right-hand man, Ignacio González (also her successor as regional president) for misappropriation of public funds in the Lezo corruption scandal. She was replaced as spokesperson of the PP municipal group by José Luis Martínez-Almeida.

=== Life after retirement and judicial case ===
After her retirement, she divided her spare time between the dedication to her 6 grandchildren and her passion for golf. Following an August 2019 request filed by the Prosecution service of the Audiencia Nacional before the instructing judge Manuel García-Castellón, the former charged Aguirre (along with her successors in the presidency of the Madrid region, Ignacio González and Cristina Cifuentes) with alleged crimes of illicit funding, diversion of public money and document forgery on 2 September 2019 in the proceedings of the Púnica corruption case. García-Castellón, pointed out on a tentative basis the alleged &quot;decisive and essential&quot; role of Aguirre in the PP&#x27;s illegal funding scheme, through which more than 6 million euros were subtracted from 8 regional ministries and agencies.

On 19 March 2020 alongside her husband, Aguirre was admitted to the hospital after being tested positive for COVID-19 during coronavirus pandemic in Spain.

== Positions and ideology ==
Esperanza Aguirre self-defines as a &quot;liberal&quot;. Known by her professed anglophilia, she has cited her admiration for the figure of Margaret Thatcher. According to Jorge del Palacio, Aguirre aimed to develop a Spanish version of the uneasy union between conservatism and the liberalism inspired by Friederich Hayek. She has often been regarded as a leading figure of the most conservative wing of the PP, and, having reportedly held political differences and an uneasy personal relationship with PP&#x27;s leader Mariano Rajoy, she personally asked the latter for a change in the leadership of the party before the June 2016 general election.

<text>Scottish Church College is a college affiliated by Calcutta University, India. It offers selective co-educational undergraduate and postgraduate studies and is the oldest continuously running Christian liberal arts and sciences college in Asia. It has been rated (A) by the Indian National Assessment and Accreditation Council. Students and alumni call themselves &quot;Caledonians&quot; in the name of the college festival, &quot;Caledonia&quot;. The Scottish Church College has been embellished as GRADE-I Heritage Building on 8 November 2023. 

==Foundation==
The origins are traceable to the life of Alexander Duff (1806–1878), the first overseas missionary of the Church of Scotland, to India. Known initially as the &quot;General Assembly&#x27;s Institution&quot;, it was founded on 13 July 1830. Alexander Duff was born on 25 April 1806, in Moulin, Perthshire, located in the Scottish countryside. He attended the University of St Andrews where after graduation, he opted for a missionary life. Subsequently, he undertook his evangelical mission to India. In a voyage that involved two shipwrecks (first on the ship &quot;Lady Holland&quot; off Dassen Island, near Cape Town, and later on the ship &quot;Moira&quot;, near the Ganges delta) and the loss of his personal library consisting of 800 volumes (of which 40 survived), and college prizes, he arrived in Calcutta on 27 May 1830.

Supported by the Governor-General of India Lord William Bentinck, Rev. Alexander Duff opened his institution in &quot;Feringhi Kamal Bose&quot;&#x27;s house, located in upper Chitpore Road, near Jorasanko. In 1836 the institution was moved to Gorachand Bysack&#x27;s house at Garanhatta. Mr. MacFarlane, the Chief-Magistrate of Calcutta, laid the foundation stone on 23 February 1837. Mr. John Gray, elected by Messrs. Burn &amp; Co. and superintended by Captain John Thomson of the East India Company designed the building. It is possible that he may have been inspired by the facade of the Holy House of Mercy in Macau, which reflects the influence of Portuguese. Traces of English Palladianism are also evident in the design of the college. The construction of the building was completed in 1839.
==Historical context==
In the early 1800s, under the regime of the East India Company, English education and Missionary activities were initially suspect. While the East India Company supported Orientalist instruction in the vernacular languages like Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit, and helped to establish institutions like Calcutta Madrasah College, and Sanskrit College, in general, colonial administrative policy discouraged the dissemination of knowledge in their language, that is in English. The general apathy of the Company towards the cause of education and improvement of natives is in many ways, the background for the agency of missionaries like Duff.

Inspired by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Reverend Alexander Duff, then a young missionary, arrived in India&#x27;s colonial capital to set up an English-medium institution. Though Bengalis had shown some interest in the spread of Western education from the beginning of the 19th century, both the local church and government officers were skeptical about the high-caste Bengali&#x27;s response to the idea of an English-medium institution. While Orientalists like James Prinsep were supportive of the idea of vernacular education, Duff and prominent Indians like Raja Ram Mohan Roy supported the use of English as a medium of instruction. His emphasis on the use of English on Indian soil was prophetic:
Raja Ram Mohan Roy helped Duff by organizing the venue and bringing in the first batch of students. He also assured the guardians that reading the King James&#x27;s Bible did not necessarily imply religious conversion, unless that was based on inner spiritual conviction. Imbibing the tenets of the Scottish educational system that shaped his ideals, Duff was, unlike the missionaries and scholars at the Serampore College, wholeheartedly committed to the cause of instruction in the English language, as that facilitated the advanced study of European religion, literature and science. By carefully selecting teachers, European and Indian, who brought out the best of Christian and secular understandings, and by emphasizing advanced pedagogical techniques that emphasized the Socratic method of classroom debate, inquiry, and rational thinking, Duff and his followers established an educational system, whose impact in spreading progressive values in contemporary Bengal would be profound. Although his ultimate aim was the spread of English education, Duff was aware that a foreign language could not be mastered without command of the native language. Hence in his General Assembly&#x27;s Institution (as later in his Free Church Institution), teaching and learning in the dominant vernacular Bengali language was also emphasized. Duff and his successors also underscored the necessity of sports among his students. When he introduced political economy as a subject in the curricula, his faced his church&#x27;s criticism. 

In 1840, Duff returned to India. At the Disruption of 1843, Duff sided with the Free Church. He gave up the college buildings, with all their effects and established a new institution, called the Free Church Institution. He had the support of Sir James Outram and Sir Henry Lawrence, and the encouragement of seeing a new band of converts, including several young men born of high caste. In 1844, governor-general Viscount Hardinge opened government appointments to all who had studied in institutions similar to Duff&#x27;s institution. In the same year, Duff co-founded the &quot;Calcutta Review&quot;, of which he served as editor from 1845 to 1849. In 1857, when the University of Calcutta was established, the Free Church Institution was one of its earliest affiliates, and Duff would also serve in the university&#x27;s first senate. These two institutions founded by Duff, i.e., the General Assembly&#x27;s Institution and the Free Church Institution would be merged later to form the Scottish Churches College. After the unification of the Church of Scotland in 1929, the institution would be known as Scottish Church College.

Along with Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the great social reformer often called the &quot;father of modern India&quot;, Dr. Duff supported Lord Macaulay in drafting his influential &quot;Minute for the introduction of English education in India&quot;. Eminent contemporary and successive missionary scholars from Scotland, notably Dr. Ogilvie, Dr. Hastie, Dr. Macdonald, Dr. Stephen, Dr. Watt, and William Spence Urquhart contributed in spreading liberal Western education. The institutions founded by Duff have been coterminous with other contemporary institutions like the Serampore College, and the Hindu College in ushering the spirit of intellectual inquiry and a general acceptance of the ideals of the Enlightenment among Bengali Hindus, the then dominant indigenous ethno-linguistic group in the Company administered Indian territories. This exchange of ideas and ideals, and adoption of progressive values that would eventually influence many social reform movements in South Asia, has been widely regarded by historians specializing in nineteenth century India, as the epochs of the Young Bengal Movement and later, the Bengal Renaissance.

Duff&#x27;s contemporaries included Reverend Mackay, Reverend Ewart and Reverend Thomas Smith. Till the early 20th century the norm was to bring teachers from Scotland, and this brought forth scholars like William Spence Urquhart, Henry Stephen, H.M. Percival etc. Indian scholars were also engaged as teachers by the college authorities, and the notable faculty includes names like Surendranath Banerjee, Kalicharan Bandyopadhyay, Jnan Chandra Ghosh, Gouri Shankar Dey, Adhar Chandra Mukhopadhyay, Sushil Chandra Dutta, Mohimohan Basu, Sudhir Kumar Dasgupta, Nirmal Chandra Bhattacharya, Bholanath Mukhopadhyay and Kalidas Nag, all of whom had all contributed to enhancing the academic standards of the college.

The college authorities played a pioneering role in promoting gender equality by emphasizing the significance of women&#x27;s education. During much of the nineteenth century, the college remained the only institution of its kind in the city of Calcutta (and indeed in the country) to promote the cause of co-education. Female students comprise half the present roll strength of the college. With the added interest of the missionaries in educational work and social welfare, the college stands as a monument to Indo-Scottish co-operation.

=== Postage stamp ===
On 27 September 1980, the Indian Postal Service released a commemorative stamp of the college.

== Campus and infrastructure ==
=== Buildings ===
The main building houses the economics, history, political science, philosophy, zoology, botany, mathematics, English, Sanskrit and Bengali departments.

The biological science departments are in possession of a museum and a &#x27;poly-house&#x27;. The college is encompassed by a garden and a lawn. Many medicinal plants are grown in the garden under the care of the botany department. There are rare and non-native plants in the garden as well. The Scottish Church College campus is a &#x27;green&#x27; campus with solar lighting. A separate building houses the department of teacher education.

== Halls of residence ==
The college presently has four hostels for its students, all of which are situated near the college. Previously, another hostel, Students&#x27; Residence (for Girls) was present. They have recreational common rooms with audio-visual equipment.

The volunteers of the college NSS unit participated in North-East Youth Festival, held at Arunachal Pradesh in 2012 and NSS Mega Camp held at Assam in 2013. Some of them also took part in Rock Climbing and Adventure camp at Balasore, Odisha (India) and were awarded the title of &quot;Basic Mountaineer&quot;.

The college received four awards from the University of Calcutta for its activities in NSS. Prof. U.N. Nandi became the Best Program Officer in 2009. Parag Chatterjee, a student of Computer Science and the NSS student leader (2011–2013), was awarded &quot;Best Volunteer&quot; by the university. 

== Awards and recognition ==

In 2006, the University Grants Commission (India) accepted the recommendations of the University of Calcutta to regard the college as &quot;College with Potential for Excellence&quot;.

== Alumni ==
==Status and initiatives==
* Until 1953, administrative control over the college was exercised by the Foreign Mission Committee of the Church of Scotland. This was exercised by a local council consisting of representatives of the Church of Scotland and the United Church of Northern India. Later the Foreign Mission Committee of Church of Scotland relinquished its authority to the United Church of Northern India, and in 1970, the United Church of Northern India joined the Church of North India as a constituent body. This made the Church of North India the &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; successor (to the Church of Scotland) in running the administration of the college. As the college was founded on Christian (Protestant and Presbyterian) foundations, it derives its legal authority and status as a religious minority institution as defined by the scope of Article 30 of the Constitution of India.
* On 27 September 1980, the Indian Postal Service released a commemorative stamp on the college.
* In 2003, the college buildings and premises underwent renovation, with the financial support of the alumni and well-wishers.
* In 2004, the general section of the college was awarded grade &#x27;A&#x27; after accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council. The same grade was awarded upon reaccreditation in 2014.
* Since 2004, the college has been a member of the &quot;United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia&quot; and is a participant in that organization&#x27;s &quot;Asian University Leadership Program&quot;.
* In 2011, the Scottish Government instituted a Centre of Tagore Studies in Edinburgh&#x27;s Napier University, to facilitate integrated research on Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s works and philosophy. In Calcutta, this scholarly initiative (with student exchange programs) was extended to the college, involving the departments of English, Bengali and philosophy.
* The University Grants Commission sponsors the construction of the Quarto Sept Centennial Jubilee Building project of the college. The building plan has been approved by the Heritage Committee of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation for necessary approval. The construction of the new building has been completed with modern equipments and audio-visual system worth for having special lectures which can also be broadcast to other colleges through online. The building was Inaugurated by the Members of college administrative body (College Rector Dr.J.Abraham and Principal alongside)
*Scottish Church College celebrated its 184th Foundation Day and its first Alexander Duff Memorial Lecture on 13 July 2013. Dr. S. C. Jamir, the Honorable Governor of Odisha and an alumnus of the college, delivered the first Alexander Duff Memorial Lecture.

==In popular culture==
===In fiction===
* Satyajit Ray&#x27;s fictional scientist-cum-investigator Professor Shonku started his career as a professor of physics at the Scottish Church College.
* Satyajit Ray&#x27;s fictional private investigator Feluda was a student of the Scottish Church College.
* Samaresh Majumdar&#x27;s bestselling novel &quot;Kalbela&quot;, which explores Calcutta&#x27;s culture, politics and society in the aftermath of the 1970s Naxalite movement, won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1984. It featured the college as a backdrop in the storyline.
*Samaresh Majumdar&#x27;s Animesh quartet, a series of four novels (&quot;Uttoradhikar&quot;, &quot;Kalbela&quot; and &quot;Kalpurush&quot;, and &quot;Mousholkal&quot;), revolves around the life and experiences of Animesh Mitra, an alumnus, who witnesses the tumultuous socio-political transformations in post-independence West Bengal.

===In non-fiction===
* &quot;Kaalbela: Calcutta My Love&quot;, a 2009 Bengali film directed by Goutam Ghose on the events of the 1970s Naxalite movement, had scenes which were shot at the college.
* &quot;Egaro: The Immortal Eleven&quot; was a 2011 sports film in Bengali directed by Arun Roy, that was based on the Mohun Bagan Athletic Club&#x27;s victory over the East Yorkshire Regiment in the finals of the 1911 IFA Shield. Three members of the winning team were students of the college. The film also showed the college as a background.
*&quot;Natoker Moto&quot; was a 2015 biographical Bengali language film, which was roughly based on the life and tragic death of Keya Chakraborty, an alumna, who subsequently became a prominent theatre personality. The character based on her is called &quot;Kheya&quot; in the film.

<doc id="844454" wikidata="Q3589012" url="?curid=844454" title="Enoyl CoA isomerase">
<text>Enoyl-CoA-(∆) isomerase (, also known as dodecenoyl-CoA-(∆) isomerase, 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase, ∆3(cis),∆2(trans)-enoyl-CoA isomerase, or acetylene-allene isomerase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of cis- or trans-double bonds of coenzyme A (CoA) bound fatty acids at gamma-carbon (position 3) to trans double bonds at beta-carbon (position 2) as below:

This enzyme has an important role in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids in beta oxidation.

==Mechanism==
Enoyl-CoA isomerase is involved in the beta-oxidation, one of the most frequently used pathways in fatty acid degradation, of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds at odd-numbered carbon positions. It does so by shifting the position of the double bonds in the acyl-CoA intermediates and converting 3-cis or trans-enoyl-CoA to 2-trans-enoyl-CoA. Since the key step in the degradation of fatty acids with double bonds at even-numbered carbon positions also produces 3-trans-enoyl-CoA in mammals and yeasts, enoyl-CoA isomerase is technically required for their metabolism as well. The reaction mechanism is detailed in figure 1, and the base that initiates the isomerization and NH groups that stabilize the intermediate are located on the active site of enoyl-coA isomerase.

As it functions in the step immediately preceding the actual beta-oxidation and forms a double bond extending from the beta-carbon (position 2), enoyl-CoA isomerase is involved in both the NADPH-dependent and NADPH-independent pathways of beta-oxidation. The double bond serves as the target of oxidation and carbon-to-carbon bond cleavage, thereby shortening the fatty acid chain.

==Sub-classification==
Enoyl-CoA isomerases can be categorized into three classes:
*monofunctional mitochondrial
*monofunctional peroxisomal
*multifunctional
The monofunctional mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes are found in the mitochondria and peroxisomes of eukaryotes, respectively. The multifunctional enzymes are found in bacteria and in the peroxisomes of some eukaryotes, but they serve two functions: the N-terminal domain works the same as the other classes of enoyl-CoA isomerases and the C-terminal domain works as a dehydrogenase, specifically, to 3-hydroxyactyl-CoA. There are two divisions among the mitochondrial enoyl Co-A isomerase: short-chain and long-chain [4]. In an immunoblot, antibodies were run against all enoyl CoA isomerase. However, two of these isomerases had antibody attachment: the short chain isomerase and the peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme. There was one enzyme which did not have binding specificity to this antibody: mitochondrial long-chain isomerase. Long-chain isomerase was found when it eluted at a lower potassium phosphate concentration in the gradient. Thus, the discovery of three sub-classes of enoyl CoA isomerase was made.

Although all three classes of enzymes have the same function, there is little overlap among their amino acid sequences. For example, only 40 out of 302 amino acid sequences (13%) are the same between monofunctional peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzymes in humans. In fact, in mammals, the peroxisomal enzyme has an extra N-terminal domain that is not present in the mitochondrial counterpart. Also, it has been found to be a subunit of the peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme (pTFE) and contributes only to minor cleavages of the fatty acid chain. In that sense, for many higher organisms, the mitochondrial enzyme is essential for deriving maximum energy from lipids and fueling muscles.

Mitochondria (both short- and long-chain) of rat liver contain more than one enoyl Co-A isomerase. To further support the idea that short- and long-chain isomerases elute at different concentration of potassium phosphate concentration, they do not share similar primary polypeptide structure, hence they must not be evolutionarily related. Peroxisomes of plants and of rat liver are very different in the way they operate. Despite their primary structure similarities, there are differences among the different specimen. To begin with, the peroxisomes of rat liver are a multifunctional enzyme including enoyl-CoA isomerase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, and L-(−)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Three different enzymes reside on this entity (multifunctional protein) allowing this enzyme to perform isomerization, hydration, and dehydration. Isomerase activity on the multifunctional enzyme occurs at the amino-terminal catalytic half of the protein along with the hydratase activity. The dehydrogenase activity of enoyl-CoA occurs in the carboxyl-terminal. Upon further investigation of the CoA binding site on the amino-terminal half of the multifunctional protein, the CoA substrate is not transferred through the aqueous phase from the isomerization phase to the site of hydration or does not have a bulk phase. This removes the need for a substrate transferring enzyme. On the other hand, the cotyledons convert long-chain 3-trans-enoyl-CoA, long-chain 3-cis-enoyl-CoA, and short-chain 3-cis-enoyl-CoA species into their 2- trans-enoyl-CoA respective forms. As previously mentioned, plant enoyl-CoA isomerase exclusively forms the 2-trans isomer as product. It does not act on 4-cis-enoyl-CoA species or 2-trans- 4-trans-dienoyl-CoA species. In comparing the products of the plant peroxisome and the multifunctional enzyme of rat liver, the plant has no hydratase activity. The Plant form did not form a 2-cis-isomer (from enoyl-CoA hydratase) or D- or L- 3 hydroxy derivative (L-(−)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase): products of multifunctional enzyme of rat liver. The turnover rates of these the two sub divisions of peroxisomes are very different. The Kcat/Km ratio in cotyledons is 10^6 M-1s-1 which outperforms the ratio .07 * 10^6 M-1s-1. Due to a high turnover rate, the plant peroxisomes contain a lesser amount of enoyl-CoA isomerase than their counterparts in the rat liver.

In rat liver, mitochondrial enoyl CoA isomerase and peroxisomal enoyl CoA isomerase embedded in the multifunctional enzyme have similarities in the primary structure sequence. When comparing the amino-terminal half of E. coli against the amino-terminal half of rat liver, there were primary and secondary structure similarities towards the middle of the amino-terminal end. This conserved region must be important for structure and function of this specific enzyme since showing equally in both E. coli and rat liver.

==Structure==
All classes of enoyl-CoA isomerases belong to a family of enzymes, the hydratase/isomerase or crotonase superfamily, and when examined with x-ray crystallography, exhibit a common structural feature of the family, the N-terminal core with a spiral fold composed of four turns, each turn consisting of two beta-sheets and one alpha-helix.

In enoyl-CoA isomerase, the two beta-sheets are part of the catalytic site, since the NH groups of residues following the beta-sheets attach to the carbonyl oxygen of the acyl-CoA intermediate. The formation of this oxyanion hole stabilizes the transition state of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

Moreover, a glutamate residue located next to body cavities filled with water molecules and lined with hydrophobic or apolar side chains has also been identified as a part of the catalytic site. In its deprotonated form, the glutamate can act as a base and remove a proton from the acyl-CoA intermediate. The body cavities aid in rearranging the glutamate side chain to retain the proton and later deliver it back to the acyl-CoA, on a different carbon position.

The NH-containing residues have been identified as Ala70 and Leu126 and the glutamate as Glu158 in peroxisomal enzymes in a yeast species, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Their relative locations on the enzyme can be compared in figure 2.

The enzymes of the hydratase/isomerase or crotonase superfamily are typically trimeric disks dimerized into hexamers. The wide range of their substrate-enzyme specificity derives from the variations in the distances between the trimeric disks and their orientation. However, the human mitochondrial enoyl-CoA isomerase is a trimer and orients the fatty acid tail in a completely different direction from that seen in the hexamers. The trimeric disk of peroxisomal enzymes in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is displayed in figure 3.

==History==
Enoyl-CoA isomerase was first identified and purified from rat liver mitochondria in the 1960s and 1970s via gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Since then, all classes of enoyl-CoA isomerase, mitochondrial, peroxisomal and multifunctional, have been identified in different organisms, including more mammals, plants, and unicellular organisms.

By 1994, using the rat enoyl-CoA isomerase cDNA as a hybridization probe, human enoyl-CoA isomerase cDNA could be sequenced and cloned. In the same year, the protein itself was isolated, not by affinity to rat antibody or cDNA probes, but by copurification with a transferase, human glutathione S-transferases.

In the attempts to examine the human enoyl-CoA isomerase in detail, the mitochondrial enzyme in the mammalian liver was identified as a potential biological marker for metabolic diseases due to its elevated levels in defective cells, and linked defects in fatty acid beta-oxidation to human diseases, to be specified in the next section.

==Clinical significance==
In humans, defects in the beta-oxidation mechanism result in hypoketotic hyperglycemia, a symptom of starvation, due to the inefficient utilization of fatty acids as a primary source of energy. The metabolic disease was found to be on a genetic level: rats without the genes for enoyl-CoA isomerase also displayed high blood glucose level. Moreover, a biological marker for this condition may have been identified as the urine of these rats included high concentrations of medium chain unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, a condition called dicarboxylic aciduria.

More recent studies link hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to defects in fatty acid degradation, specifically, to that in enoyl-CoA isomerase. HCV is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, and more than 180 million people are affected globally. Due to the prolonged latency of the virus and no existing cures to rid the virus specifically, HCV is a serious problem that is causing more deaths than HIV/AIDS in the United States, but its threat still do not receive adequate attention. The need for a HCV-specific treatment is essential, and according to John Ward, the director of the CDC Hepatitis Division, it can save up to 120,000 lives.

According to protein profiling in the human liver biopsies of HCV patients, a correlation was initially discovered between dysfunctional mitochondrial processes, which include beta-oxidation, and HCV. As a matter of fact, lipids play an important role in the replication cycle of HCV, and in the &quot;in vivo&quot; samples from HCV patients, many lipids were found in abundance to aid HCV in virus uptake, RNA replication, and secretion from host cells. Enzymes that regulate fatty acid metabolism, including enoyl-CoA isomerase, were also similarly upregulated. Gene silencing techniques revealed that enoyl-CoA isomerase is essential in HCV RNA replication, and opened ways to stop HCV infection on an intracellular level.

<text>In mathematics, particularly category theory, a representable functor is a certain functor from an arbitrary category into the category of sets. Such functors give representations of an abstract category in terms of known structures (i.e. sets and functions) allowing one to utilize, as much as possible, knowledge about the category of sets in other settings.

From another point of view, representable functors for a category &quot;C&quot; are the functors &quot;given&quot; with &quot;C&quot;. Their theory is a vast generalisation of upper sets in posets, and Yoneda&#x27;s representability theorem generalizes Cayley&#x27;s theorem in group theory.

==Definition==

Let C be a locally small category and let Set be the category of sets. For each object &quot;A&quot; of C let Hom(&quot;A&quot;,–) be the hom functor that maps object &quot;X&quot; to the set Hom(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;X&quot;).

A functor &quot;F&quot; : C → Set is said to be representable if it is naturally isomorphic to Hom(&quot;A&quot;,–) for some object &quot;A&quot; of C. A representation of &quot;F&quot; is a pair (&quot;A&quot;, Φ) where
:Φ : Hom(&quot;A&quot;,–) → &quot;F&quot;
is a natural isomorphism.

A contravariant functor &quot;G&quot; from C to Set is the same thing as a functor &quot;G&quot; : Cop → Set and is commonly called a presheaf. A presheaf is representable when it is naturally isomorphic to the contravariant hom-functor Hom(–,&quot;A&quot;) for some object &quot;A&quot; of C.

== Universal elements ==
According to Yoneda&#x27;s lemma, natural transformations from Hom(&quot;A&quot;,–) to &quot;F&quot; are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). Given a natural transformation Φ : Hom(&quot;A&quot;,–) → &quot;F&quot; the corresponding element &quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is given by
:formula_1
Conversely, given any element &quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) we may define a natural transformation Φ : Hom(&quot;A&quot;,–) → &quot;F&quot; via
:formula_2
where &quot;f&quot; is an element of Hom(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;X&quot;). In order to get a representation of &quot;F&quot; we want to know when the natural transformation induced by &quot;u&quot; is an isomorphism. This leads to the following definition:
:A universal element of a functor &quot;F&quot; : C → Set is a pair (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;u&quot;) consisting of an object &quot;A&quot; of C and an element &quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) such that for every pair (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) consisting of an object &quot;X&quot; of C and an element &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) there exists a unique morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;X&quot; such that (&quot;Ff&quot;)(&quot;u&quot;) = &quot;v&quot;.
A universal element may be viewed as a universal morphism from the one-point set {•} to the functor &quot;F&quot; or as an initial object in the category of elements of &quot;F&quot;.

The natural transformation induced by an element &quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is an isomorphism if and only if (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;u&quot;) is a universal element of &quot;F&quot;. We therefore conclude that representations of &quot;F&quot; are in one-to-one correspondence with universal elements of &quot;F&quot;. For this reason, it is common to refer to universal elements (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;u&quot;) as representations.

==Examples==

* The functor represented by a scheme &quot;A&quot; can sometimes describe families of geometric objects&quot;.&quot; For example, vector bundles of rank &quot;k&quot; over a given algebraic variety or scheme &quot;X&quot; correspond to algebraic morphisms formula_3 where &quot;A&quot; is the Grassmannian of &quot;k&quot;-planes in a high-dimensional space. Also certain types of subschemes are represented by Hilbert schemes. 
* Let &quot;C&quot; be the category of CW-complexes with morphisms given by homotopy classes of continuous functions. For each natural number &quot;n&quot; there is a contravariant functor &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → Ab which assigns each CW-complex its &quot;n&quot;th cohomology group (with integer coefficients). Composing this with the forgetful functor we have a contravariant functor from &quot;C&quot; to Set. Brown&#x27;s representability theorem in algebraic topology says that this functor is represented by a CW-complex &quot;K&quot;(Z,&quot;n&quot;) called an Eilenberg–MacLane space.
*Consider the contravariant functor &quot;P&quot; : Set → Set which maps each set to its power set and each function to its inverse image map. To represent this functor we need a pair (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;u&quot;) where &quot;A&quot; is a set and &quot;u&quot; is a subset of &quot;A&quot;, i.e. an element of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), such that for all sets &quot;X&quot;, the hom-set Hom(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) is isomorphic to &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) via Φ&quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = (&quot;Pf&quot;)&quot;u&quot; = &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;u&quot;). Take &quot;A&quot; = {0,1} and &quot;u&quot; = {1}. Given a subset &quot;S&quot; ⊆ &quot;X&quot; the corresponding function from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;A&quot; is the characteristic function of &quot;S&quot;.
*Forgetful functors to Set are very often representable. In particular, a forgetful functor is represented by (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;u&quot;) whenever &quot;A&quot; is a free object over a singleton set with generator &quot;u&quot;.
** The forgetful functor Grp → Set on the category of groups is represented by (Z, 1).
** The forgetful functor Ring → Set on the category of rings is represented by (Z[&quot;x&quot;], &quot;x&quot;), the polynomial ring in one variable with integer coefficients.
** The forgetful functor Vect → Set on the category of real vector spaces is represented by (R, 1).
** The forgetful functor Top → Set on the category of topological spaces is represented by any singleton topological space with its unique element.
*A group &quot;G&quot; can be considered a category (even a groupoid) with one object which we denote by •. A functor from &quot;G&quot; to Set then corresponds to a &quot;G&quot;-set. The unique hom-functor Hom(•,–) from &quot;G&quot; to Set corresponds to the canonical &quot;G&quot;-set &quot;G&quot; with the action of left multiplication. Standard arguments from group theory show that a functor from &quot;G&quot; to Set is representable if and only if the corresponding &quot;G&quot;-set is simply transitive (i.e. a &quot;G&quot;-torsor or heap). Choosing a representation amounts to choosing an identity for the heap.
*Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring with identity, and let R-Mod be the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules. If &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are unitary modules over &quot;R&quot;, there is a covariant functor &quot;B&quot;: R-Mod → Set which assigns to each &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;P&quot; the set of &quot;R&quot;-bilinear maps &quot;M&quot; × &quot;N&quot; → &quot;P&quot; and to each &quot;R&quot;-module homomorphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; the function &quot;B&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) : &quot;B&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) → &quot;B&quot;(&quot;Q&quot;) which sends each bilinear map &quot;g&quot; : &quot;M&quot; × &quot;N&quot; → &quot;P&quot; to the bilinear map &quot;f&quot;∘&quot;g&quot; : &quot;M&quot; × &quot;N&quot;→&quot;Q&quot;. The functor &quot;B&quot; is represented by the &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; ⊗&quot;R&quot; &quot;N&quot;.

== Analogy: Representable functionals ==
Consider a linear functional on a complex Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, i.e. a linear function formula_4. The Riesz representation theorem states that if &quot;F&quot; is continuous, then there exists a unique element formula_5 which represents &quot;F&quot; in the sense that &quot;F&quot; is equal to the inner product functional formula_6, that is formula_7 for formula_8. 

For example, the continuous linear functionals on the square-integrable function space formula_9 are all representable in the form formula_10 for a unique function formula_11. The theory of distributions considers more general continuous functionals on the space of test functions formula_12. Such a distribution functional is not necessarily representable by a function, but it may be considered intuitively as a generalized function. For instance, the Dirac delta function is the distribution defined by formula_13 for each test function formula_14, and may be thought of as &quot;represented&quot; by an infinitely tall and thin bump function near formula_15. 

Thus, a function formula_16 may be determined not by its values, but by its effect on other functions via the inner product. Analogously, an object &quot;A&quot; in a category may be characterized not by its internal features, but by its functor of points, i.e. its relation to other objects via morphisms. Just as non-representable functionals are described by distributions, non-representable functors may be described by more complicated structures such as stacks. 

==Properties==

===Uniqueness===

Representations of functors are unique up to a unique isomorphism. That is, if (&quot;A&quot;1,Φ1) and (&quot;A&quot;2,Φ2) represent the same functor, then there exists a unique isomorphism φ : &quot;A&quot;1 → &quot;A&quot;2 such that
:formula_17
as natural isomorphisms from Hom(&quot;A&quot;2,–) to Hom(&quot;A&quot;1,–). This fact follows easily from Yoneda&#x27;s lemma.

Stated in terms of universal elements: if (&quot;A&quot;1,&quot;u&quot;1) and (&quot;A&quot;2,&quot;u&quot;2) represent the same functor, then there exists a unique isomorphism φ : &quot;A&quot;1 → &quot;A&quot;2 such that 
:formula_18

===Preservation of limits===

Representable functors are naturally isomorphic to Hom functors and therefore share their properties. In particular, (covariant) representable functors preserve all limits. It follows that any functor which fails to preserve some limit is not representable.

Contravariant representable functors take colimits to limits.

===Left adjoint===

Any functor &quot;K&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → Set with a left adjoint &quot;F&quot; : Set → &quot;C&quot; is represented by (&quot;FX&quot;, η&quot;X&quot;(•)) where &quot;X&quot; = {•} is a singleton set and η is the unit of the adjunction.

Conversely, if &quot;K&quot; is represented by a pair (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;u&quot;) and all small copowers of &quot;A&quot; exist in &quot;C&quot; then &quot;K&quot; has a left adjoint &quot;F&quot; which sends each set &quot;I&quot; to the &quot;I&quot;th copower of &quot;A&quot;.

Therefore, if &quot;C&quot; is a category with all small copowers, a functor &quot;K&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → Set is representable if and only if it has a left adjoint.

==Relation to universal morphisms and adjoints==

The categorical notions of universal morphisms and adjoint functors can both be expressed using representable functors.

Let &quot;G&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; be a functor and let &quot;X&quot; be an object of &quot;C&quot;. Then (&quot;A&quot;,φ) is a universal morphism from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;G&quot; if and only if (&quot;A&quot;,φ) is a representation of the functor Hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;G&quot;–) from &quot;D&quot; to Set. It follows that &quot;G&quot; has a left-adjoint &quot;F&quot; if and only if Hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;G&quot;–) is representable for all &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot;. The natural isomorphism Φ&quot;X&quot; : Hom&quot;D&quot;(&quot;FX&quot;,–) → Hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;G&quot;–) yields the adjointness; that is 
:formula_19
is a bijection for all &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

The dual statements are also true. Let &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; be a functor and let &quot;Y&quot; be an object of &quot;D&quot;. Then (&quot;A&quot;,φ) is a universal morphism from &quot;F&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; if and only if (&quot;A&quot;,φ) is a representation of the functor Hom&quot;D&quot;(&quot;F&quot;–,&quot;Y&quot;) from &quot;C&quot; to Set. It follows that &quot;F&quot; has a right-adjoint &quot;G&quot; if and only if Hom&quot;D&quot;(&quot;F&quot;–,&quot;Y&quot;) is representable for all &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;D&quot;.

<text>In the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy, a subdomain is a domain that is a part of another (main) domain. For example, if a domain offered an online store as part of their website codice_1, it might use the subdomain codice_2 .

== Overview ==
The Domain Name System (DNS) has a tree structure or hierarchy, which includes nodes on the tree being a domain name. A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. Each label may contain from 0 to 63 octets. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation.

Subdomains are defined by editing the DNS zone file pertaining to the parent domain. However, there is an ongoing debate over the use of the term &quot;subdomain&quot; when referring to names which map to the Address record A (host) and various other types of zone records which may map to any public IP address destination and any type of server. Network Operations teams insist that it is inappropriate to use the term &quot;subdomain&quot; to refer to any mapping other than that provided by zone NS (name server) records and any server-destination other than that.

According to RFC 1034, &quot;a domain is a subdomain of another domain if it is contained within that domain&quot;. Based on that definition, a host cannot be a subdomain, only a domain can be a subdomain. A subdomain will also have a separate zone file with a SOA record (Start of Authority).

Most domain registries only allocate a two-level domain name. Hosting services typically provide DNS Servers to resolve subdomains within that master domain.

A fully qualified domain name consists of multiple parts. For example, take the English Wikipedia domain codice_3.
The codice_4 is a subdomain of codice_5.
Although codice_5 is usually considered to be the domain name, codice_7 is actually a sub-domain of the codice_8 TLD (top level domain). Any fully qualified domain name can be a host or a subdomain.

A domain name that does not include any subdomains is known as an &quot;apex domain&quot;, &quot;root domain&quot;, or &quot;bare domain&quot;. For example, codice_5 is the apex domain of Wikipedia, which redirects to the subdomain codice_10.

To discover more subdomains associated with a domain, you can utilize a variety of methods and tools. Automated tools like Amass and Subfinder leverage open-source intelligence and SSL certificate data to quickly uncover subdomains. Google Dorking, using the &quot;site:&quot; operator, allows for manual searches of indexed subdomains, while brute force techniques systematically query DNS servers with potential names. Passive DNS reconnaissance through APIs from services like SecurityTrails &amp; Subdomain Center can reveal historical data without direct queries. Additionally, community resources such as GitHub and Pastebin may contain publicly available lists of subdomains. Combining these approaches will enhance your ability to effectively identify hidden or overlooked subdomains for security assessments or research purposes.

== Subdomain usage ==
Subdomains are often used by internet service providers supplying web services. They allocate one (or more) subdomains to their clients who do not have their own domain name. This allows independent administration by the clients over their subdomain.

Subdomains are also used by organizations that wish to assign a unique name to a particular department, function, or service related to the organization. For example, a university might assign &quot;cs&quot; to the computer science department, such that a number of hosts could be used inside that subdomain, such as codice_11.

There are some widely recognized subdomains such as WWW and FTP. This allows for a structure where the domain contains administrative directories and files including the FTP directories and webpages. The FTP subdomain could contain logs and the web page directories, while the WWW subdomain contains the directories for the webpages. Independent authentication for each domain provides access control over the various levels of the domain.

== Uses ==
===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the second-level domain names are standard and branch off from the top-level domain. For example:

* .ac.uk: academic (tertiary education, further education colleges and research establishments) and learned societies
* .co.uk: general use (usually commercial)
* .gov.uk: government (central and local)
* .judiciary.uk: courts (to be introduced in the near future)
* .ltd.uk: limited companies
* .me.uk: general use (usually personal)
* .mod.uk: Ministry of Defence and HM Forces public sites
* .net.uk: ISPs and network companies (unlike .net, use is restricted to these users)
* .nhs.uk: National Health Service institutions
* .nic.uk: network use only (Nominet UK)
* .org.uk: general use (usually for non-profit organisations)
* .parliament.uk: parliamentary use (only for the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament)
* .plc.uk: public limited companies
* .police.uk: police forces
* .sch.uk: Local Education Authorities, schools, primary and secondary education, community education

=== Vanity domain ===
A vanity domain is a subdomain of an ISP&#x27;s domain that is aliased to an individual user account, or a subdomain that expresses the individuality of the person on whose behalf it is registered.

===Server cluster===
Depending on application, a record inside a domain, or subdomain might refer to a hostname, or a service provided by a number of machines in a cluster. Some websites use different subdomains to point to different server clusters. For example, codice_12 points to Server Cluster 1 or Datacentre 1, and codice_13 points to Server Cluster 2 or Datacentre 2 etc.

====Subdomains versus directories====
Subdomains are different from directories. Directories are physical folders on an actual computer, while subdomains are a part of the URL that can be routed to any file or folder on the server machine.

<text>Eduardo Humberto del Río García (June 20, 1934 – August 8, 2017), better known by his pen name Rius, was a Mexican intellectual, political cartoonist and writer born in Zamora, Michoacán.

One of the most popular Mexican cartoonists, Rius has written over a hundred books that remain widely popular, especially amongst his Mexican readers. Rius was a fierce political activist, and his progressive and left-wing point of view is often present in his writings, accompanied by a strong criticism about neoliberal Mexican doctrines, US Government policies, and the Catholic Church. He used to be an open advocate of the Cuban revolution as in &quot;Cuba for Beginners&quot; and a strong Soviet bloc sympathizer until the end of the Cold War.

In the 1960s he began cartooning in magazines and newspapers, sometimes regarding political themes. He made two famous comics, &quot;Los Supermachos&quot; and &quot;Los agachados&quot;, which were a humorous criticism of the Mexican government. After his successes with these, he made many books, all illustrated and written by hand by him and covering a range of topics on politics, vegetarianism, and religion. His books have become popular mainly because of their humour, which attempts to reach the general reader, as well as for their simplicity and intellectual acuteness. They give an overview of their theme without becoming difficult. 
In 1970, the first English edition of Rius&#x27;s book &quot;Cuba para principiantes&quot;, a humorous comic strip presentation of Cuban history and revolution, was published in the United States as &quot;Cuba for Beginners&quot;. The book made no particularly great impact, but the 1976 English language publication of &quot;Marx for Beginners&quot;, a translation of his &quot;Marx para principiantes&quot; (1972), a comic strip representation of the life and ideas of Karl Marx, became an international bestseller and kicked off the &quot;For Beginners&quot; series of books from Writers and Readers and later Icon Books.

In the 1990s, he participated in two political humour magazines: &quot;El Chahuistle&quot; and &quot;El Chamuco&quot; (named after an insect plague and the devil, respectively, because they were harsh on politicians and religious leaders).

His success and long career have made him a reference point to the newer generations of political cartoonists in México. Mexican director Alfonso Arau made &quot;Calzonzin Inspector&quot;, a live action film based on characters appearing in &quot;Los Supermachos&quot; that was released in 1974.

He died on August 8, 2017, at the age of 83.

<doc id="844475" wikidata="Q549544" url="?curid=844475" title="Beatlemania">
<text>Beatlemania was the fanaticism surrounding the English rock band the Beatles from 1963 to 1966. The group&#x27;s popularity grew in the United Kingdom in late 1963, propelled by the singles &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;From Me to You&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot;. By October, the British press adopted the term &quot;Beatlemania&quot; to describe the scenes of adulation that attended the band&#x27;s concert performances. By 22 February 1964, the Beatles held both the number one and number two spots on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot;, respectively. Their world tours were characterised by the same levels of hysteria and high-pitched screaming by female fans, both at concerts and during the group&#x27;s travels between venues. Commentators likened the intensity of this adulation to a religious fervour and to a female masturbation fantasy. Among the displays of deity-like worship, fans would approach the band in the belief that they possessed supernatural healing powers.

In February 1964, the Beatles arrived in the United States and their televised performances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; were viewed by approximately 73 million people. There, the band&#x27;s instant popularity established their international stature, and their unprecedented domination of the national sales charts was mirrored in numerous other countries. Their August 1965 concert at New York&#x27;s Shea Stadium marked the first time that a large outdoor stadium was used for such a purpose, and with an audience of 55,000, set records for attendance and revenue generation. To protect themselves from their fans, the Beatles typically travelled to these concerts by armoured car. From the end of that year, the band embraced promo clips for their singles to avoid the difficulties of making personal appearances on television programmes. Their December 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; marked a profound change in the dynamic between fans and artists, as many Beatles fans sought to appreciate the progressive quality in the band&#x27;s look, lyrics and sound.

In 1966, John Lennon controversially remarked that the group had become &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot;. Soon afterwards, when the Beatles toured Japan, the Philippines and the US, they were entangled in mob revolt, violence, political backlash and threats of assassination. Frustrated by the restrictions of Beatlemania and unable to hear themselves play above their fans&#x27; screams, the group stopped touring and became a studio-only band. Their popularity and influence expanded in various social and political arenas, while Beatlemania continued on a reduced scale from then and into the members&#x27; solo careers.

Beatlemania surpassed any previous examples of fan worship in its intensity and scope. Initially, the fans were predominantly young adolescent females, sometimes called &quot;teenyboppers&quot;, and their behaviour was scorned by many commentators. By 1965, their fanbase included listeners who traditionally shunned youth-driven pop culture, which helped bridge divisions between folk and rock enthusiasts. During the 1960s, Beatlemania was the subject of analysis by psychologists and sociologists; a 1997 study recognised the phenomenon as an early demonstration of proto-feminist girl power. The receptions of subsequent pop acts – particularly boy bands and Taylor Swift – have drawn comparisons to Beatlemania.

==Interpretations and precursors==
In the description of author and musician Bob Stanley, the band&#x27;s domestic breakthrough represented a &quot;final liberation&quot; for the nation&#x27;s teenagers and, by coinciding with the end of National Service, the group &quot;effectively signaled the end of World War II in Britain&quot;.

During the 1840s, fans of Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt showed a level of fanaticism similar to that of the Beatles. Poet Heinrich Heine coined &quot;Lisztomania&quot; to describe this. Once it became an international phenomenon in 1964, Beatlemania surpassed in intensity and reach any previous examples of fan worship, including those afforded to Rudy Vallée, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley. One factor in this development may have been the post–World War II baby boom, which gave the Beatles a larger audience of young fans than Sinatra and Presley had a decade earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynskey/Observer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists during the 1960s were especially drawn to the significance of the long hair preferred by the Beatles and the bands that emerged soon after their breakthrough. Academics proposed that the long hair signalled androgyny and thus presented a less threatening version of male sexuality to teenage girls, as well as allowing male fans to view the group in a sexual regard that they normally reserved for young females. Other concerns related to the Beatles&#x27; own sexuality; whether the haircuts were a projection of latent homosexuality or confident heterosexuality. In their 1986 book &quot;Re-making Love: The Feminization of Sex&quot;, authors Barbara Ehrenreich, Elizabeth Hess and Gloria Jacobs argued that the band&#x27;s presentable suits meant that they seemed less &quot;sleazy&quot; than Presley to middle-class whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenreich/Hess/Jacobs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1964, Paul Johnson wrote an article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; which stated that the mania was a modern incarnation of female hysteria and that the wild fans at the Beatles&#x27; concerts were &quot;the least fortunate of their generation, the dull, the idle, the failures&quot;. The article became the &quot;most complained-about piece&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s history. A 1966 study published in the &quot;British Journal of Clinical Psychology&quot; rejected Johnson&#x27;s assertion; the researchers found that Beatles fans were not likelier to score higher on Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory&#x27;s hysteria scale, nor were they unusually neurotic. Instead, they described Beatlemania as &quot;the passing reaction of predominantly young adolescent females to group pressures of such a kind that meet their special emotional needs&quot;.

==1963: UK success==
===&quot;Please Please Me&quot; and first UK tours===
The Beatles attracted a fan frenzy in the north of England since the start of the 1960s. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn says that some who attended the band&#x27;s 27 December 1960 show in Litherland claim that Beatlemania was &quot;born&quot; there, while Bob Wooler, who regularly presented the Beatles at Liverpool&#x27;s Cavern Club, wrote in August 1961 that they were &quot;the stuff that screams are made of&quot; and were already playing to &quot;fever-pitch audiences&quot; at the Cavern. However, national recognition of &quot;Beatlemania&quot; eluded the band until late 1963.

With the success of their second single &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, the Beatles found themselves in demand for the whole of 1963. In the UK, the song reached number two on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart (subsequently adopted as the UK Singles Chart), and topped both the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; charts. The band released their first album in March 1963, also titled &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. They completed four nationwide tours and performed at a great many single shows around the UK throughout the year, often finishing one show only to travel straight to the next show in another location – sometimes even to perform again the same day. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters, and other Beatle-related articles. Lennon&#x27;s August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret.

On 2 February 1963, the Beatles opened their first nationwide tour at a show in Bradford featuring Helen Shapiro, Danny Williams, Kenny Lynch, Kestrels, and the Red Price Orchestra. Heading the tour bill was 16-year-old Shapiro followed by the other five acts – the last of which was the Beatles. The band proved immensely popular during the tour, however, as journalist Gordon Sampson observed. His report did not use the word &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but the phenomenon was evident. Sampson wrote that &quot;a great reception went to the colourfully dressed Beatles, who almost stole the show, for the audience repeatedly called for them while other artists were performing!&quot; The Beatles&#x27; second nationwide tour began on 9 March at the Granada Cinema in London, where the group appeared on a bill headed by American stars Tommy Roe and Chris Montez, both of whom had firmly established themselves in the UK singles charts. Throughout the tour, the crowds repeatedly screamed for the Beatles, and the American stars were less popular than a homegrown act for the first time. The Beatles enjoyed the overwhelming enthusiasm, but they also felt embarrassment for the American performers at this unexpected turn of events, which persisted at every show on the tour.

In May, the Beatles achieved their first number 1 single on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart with &quot;From Me to You&quot;. McCartney later cited the song title, along with that of its B-side, &quot;Thank You Girl&quot;, as an example of him and Lennon directly addressing the group&#x27;s fans and appreciating that such a seemingly personal message resonated with their audience. According to Stanley, the band provided a sense of liberation for fans of both sexes, in that &quot;The boys could make as much noise as possible; the girls had something with dirt under its fingernails they could scream at.&quot;

The Beatles began their third nationwide tour on 18 May, the bill this time headed by Roy Orbison. Orbison had established even greater UK chart success than either Montez or Roe, with four hits in the top 10, but he proved less popular than the Beatles at the tour&#x27;s opening show staged at the Adelphi Cinema, Slough. It soon became obvious that this was not going to change, and a week into the tour the covers of the souvenir programs were reprinted to place the Beatles above Orbison. Starr was nonetheless impressed with the response that Orbison still commanded, saying: &quot;We would be backstage, listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just doing it by his voice. Just standing there singing, not moving or anything.&quot; The tour lasted three weeks and ended on 9 June.

===&quot;She Loves You&quot; and coinage of &quot;Beatlemania&quot;===
There was tremendous anticipation ahead of the release of the Beatles&#x27; fourth single, &quot;She Loves You&quot;. Thousands of fans ordered the single as early as June 1963, well before its title had been known. In July, the band convened at EMI Studios for the song&#x27;s recording session, an occasion that was publicised in advance by the weekly pop papers. More than a hundred fans congregated outside the studios, and dozens broke through a police blockade, swarming the building in search of the band. By the day before the single went on sale in August, some 500,000 advanced orders had been placed for it. &quot;She Loves You&quot; topped the charts and set several UK sales records. The song included a &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; refrain that became a signature hook for their European audiences; in addition, the song&#x27;s falsetto &quot;Ooh!&quot;s elicited further fan delirium when accompanied by the vocalists&#x27; exaggerated shaking of their moptop hair.
On 13 October, the Beatles starred on Val Parnell&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;, the UK&#x27;s top variety show. Their performance was televised live and watched by 15 million viewers. One national paper&#x27;s headlines in the following days coined the term &quot;Beatlemania&quot; to describe the phenomenal and increasingly hysterical interest in the Beatles – and it stuck. Publicist Tony Barrow saw Beatlemania as beginning with the band&#x27;s appearance on that program, at which point he no longer had to contact the press but had the press contacting him. Scottish music promoter Andi Lothian said that he coined &quot;Beatlemania&quot; while speaking to a reporter at the band&#x27;s Caird Hall concert, which took place as part of the Beatles&#x27; mini-tour of Scotland on 7 October. The word appeared in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 21 October for a feature story by Vincent Mulchrone headlined &quot;This Beatlemania&quot;.

The band returned from a five-day Swedish tour on 31 October 1963 and were greeted at Heathrow Airport in heavy rain by thousands of screaming fans, 50 journalists and photographers, and a BBC TV camera crew. The wild scenes at the airport delayed the British Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home, being chauffeured in the vicinity, as his car was obstructed by the crowds. The Miss World of the time was passing through the airport as well, but she was completely ignored by journalists and the public.

===Autumn UK tour and Christmas shows===

On 1 November, the Beatles began their 1963 Autumn Tour, their first tour as undisputed headliners. It produced much the same reaction from those attending, with a fervent, riotous response from fans everywhere they went. Police attempting to control the crowds employed high-pressure water hoses, and the safety of the police became a matter of national concern, provoking controversial discussions in Parliament over the thousands of police officers putting themselves at risk to protect the Beatles.

On the first tour date, at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound from the screaming crowds was so great that the Beatles&#x27; amplification equipment proved unequal to it – the band members could not hear themselves speaking, singing or playing. The next day, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; carried the headline &quot;BEATLEMANIA! It&#x27;s happening everywhere ... even in sedate Cheltenham&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published a disapproving article in which Beatlemania and the scenes of adulation were likened to Hitler&#x27;s Nuremberg Rallies. Adults, who had been accustomed to wartime deprivation in their youth, expressed concerns at the frenzied reaction given to pop groups such as the Beatles. Alternatively, a Church of England clergyman remarked that a Beatles version of the Christmas carol &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;, sung as &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot;, might restore the popularity and relevance of the church in Britain.

The tour continued until 13 December, with stops in Dublin and Belfast, and marked the &quot;pinnacle of British Beatlemania&quot;, according to Lewisohn. Maureen Lipman attended a concert in Hull as a sceptic, but 50 years later she recalled her &quot;road to Damascus moment&quot; when Lennon sang &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;: &quot;Someone very close to me screamed the most piercing of screams, a primal mating call … I realised with an electric shock that the screaming someone was me.&quot; Lipman heard that the theatre &quot;cleared away 40 pairs of abandoned knickers&quot; from other young female fans, and she concluded, &quot;life, as I knew it, was never the same again.&quot;

On 21 and 22 December, the band gave preview performances of &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Christmas Show&quot; in Bradford and Liverpool, respectively. Designed for the group&#x27;s fans and performed with several other acts, the presentation combined comedy with musical sets and was subsequently performed twice daily (apart from on New Year&#x27;s Eve) at the Finsbury Park Astoria in north London from 24 December to 11 January 1964. The Beatles also recorded the first of their annual fan club Christmas records, an initiative suggested by Barrow, which again included comedy skits and musical segments. With the November 1963 release of their second album, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, the group inaugurated a tradition of issuing a new Beatles LP in time for the Christmas sell-in period, leading fans to congregate and hold listening parties over the holiday season. Author Nicholas Schaffner, a teenager during the 1960s, said that these albums came to &quot;evoke an intangible sense of Christmas&quot; for many listeners as a result.

==1964–1965: International success==
===US breakthrough and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;===

EMI owned Capitol Records, but Capitol had declined to issue any of the band&#x27;s singles in the US for most of the year. The American press regarded the phenomenon of Beatlemania in the UK with amusement. Newspaper and magazine articles about the Beatles began to appear in the US towards the end of 1963, and they cited the English stereotype of eccentricity, reporting that the UK had finally developed an interest in rock and roll, which had come and gone a long time previously in the US. Headlines included &quot;The New Madness&quot; and &quot;Beatle Bug Bites Britain&quot;, and writers employed word-play linking &quot;beetle&quot; with the &quot;infestation&quot; afflicting the UK. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reflected the dismissive view of most adults: &quot;America had better take thought as to how it will deal with the invasion. Indeed a restrained &#x27;Beatles go home&#x27; might be just the thing.&quot; Rather than dissuading American teenagers, such disapproval from adults strengthened their connection with the band.

The Beatles&#x27; American television debut was on 18 November 1963 on &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot;, with a four-minute report by Edwin Newman. On 22 November, the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; ran a five-minute feature on Beatlemania in the UK which heavily featured their UK hit &quot;She Loves You&quot;. The evening&#x27;s scheduled repeat was cancelled following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the same day. On 10 December, Walter Cronkite decided to run the piece on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;.

American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James obtained a copy of the British single &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; in mid-December and began playing it on AM radio station WWDC in Washington, DC. Listeners repeatedly phoned in to request a replay of the song, while local record shops were flooded with requests for a record that they did not have in stock. James sent the record to other disc jockeys around the country, sparking similar reaction. On 26 December, Capitol released the record three weeks ahead of schedule. It sold a million copies and became a number-one hit in the US by mid-January. Epstein arranged for a $40,000 American marketing campaign, a deal Capitol accepted due to Ed Sullivan&#x27;s agreement to headline the Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

===First visit to the US and &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; performances===

In advance of the Beatles&#x27; arrival in the US, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the &quot;raucous sound&quot; of the band&#x27;s screaming fans made their concerts &quot;slightly orgiastic&quot;. The seating at venues would be soaked in urine after each show and, in Doggett&#x27;s description, &quot;Sociologists noted that witnessing a pop group provoked orgasms amongst girls too young to understand what they were feeling.&quot; David Holbrook wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; that it was &quot;painfully clear that the Beatles are a masturbation fantasy, such as a girl presumably has during the onanistic act – the genial smiling young male images, the music like a buzzing of the blood in the head, the rhythm, the cries, the shouted names, the climaxes.&quot;

On 3 January 1964, &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot; ran Beatles concert footage licensed from the BBC &quot;as a joke&quot; to an audience of 30 million viewers. On 7 February, an estimated 4,000 Beatles fans were present as Pan Am Flight 101 left Heathrow Airport. Among the passengers were the Beatles on their first trip to the US as a band, along with Phil Spector and an entourage of photographers and journalists. On arrival at New York&#x27;s newly renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport, they were greeted by a crowd of 4,000 Beatles fans and 200 journalists. A few people in the crowd were injured, and the airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd. The band held a press conference where they met disc jockey Murray the K, then they were driven to New York City, each in a separate limousine. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: &quot;They have just left the airport and are coming to New York City.&quot; When they reached the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Author André Millard, writing in his book &quot;Beatlemania: Technology, Business, and Teen Culture in Cold War America&quot;, says that it was this constant fan presence – outside the band&#x27;s hotels, UK residences, and recording studios – that gave Beatlemania an &quot;extra dimension that lifted it above all other incidents of fan worship&quot;.

The Beatles made their first live US television appearance on 9 February, when 73 million viewers watched them perform on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; at 8 pm – about two-fifths of the American population. According to the Nielsen ratings audience measurement system, the show had the largest number of viewers that had been recorded for an American television program. The Beatles performed their first American concert on 11 February at Washington Coliseum, a sports arena in Washington, DC, attended by 8,000. They performed a second concert the next day at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall, which was attended by 2,000, and both concerts were well received. The Beatles then flew to Miami Beach and made their second television appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on 16 February, which was broadcast live from the Napoleon Ballroom of the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach with another 70 million viewers. On 22 February, the Beatles returned to the UK and arrived at Heathrow airport at 7 am, where they were met by an estimated 10,000 fans.

An article in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; described Beatlemania as a &quot;religion of teenage culture&quot; that was indicative of how American youth now looked to their own age group for social values and role models. The US had been in mourning, fear and disbelief over the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on 22 November 1963, and contemporary pundits identified a link between the public shock and the adulation afforded the Beatles eleven weeks later. According to these writers, the Beatles reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that had faded in the wake of the assassination. Other factors cited included the threat of nuclear war, racial tensions in the US, and reports of the country&#x27;s increased involvement in the Vietnam War.

The first Beatles album issued by Capitol, &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot;, hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart (later the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200) on 15 February, and it maintained that position for 11 weeks of its 74-week chart stay. On 4 April, the group occupied the top five US single chart positions, as well as seven other positions in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. As of , they are one of only 3 acts hold the top five, the others being Drake and Taylor Swift (twice). , they had also broken 11 other chart records on the Hot 100 and the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Author David Szatmary states, &quot;In the nine days, during the Beatles&#x27; brief visit, Americans had bought more than two million Beatles records and more than 2.5 million US dollars worth of Beatles-related goods.&quot; &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; on Capitol topped the charts on 2 May and kept its peak for five weeks of its 55-week chart stay.

===1964 world tour ===


The Beatles&#x27; success established the popularity of British musical acts for the first time in the US. By mid 1964, several more UK acts came to the US, including The Kinks, the Dave Clark Five, the Rolling Stones, The Animals, Billy J. Kramer, Herman’s Hermits, Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, and Petula Clark. Completing what commentators termed the British Invasion of the US pop market, one-third of all top ten hits there in 1964 were performed by British acts. The Beatles&#x27; chart domination was repeated in countries around the world during 1964, as were the familiar displays of mania wherever the band played. Fans besieged their hotels, where sheets and pillowcases were stolen for souvenirs. As the phenomenon escalated over 1964–65, travelling to concert venues involved a journey via helicopter and armoured car. These arrangements came to resemble military operations, with decoy vehicles and a level of security normally afforded a head of state. Contrary to the presentable image the Beatles maintained for reporters covering the tours, their evening parties often descended into orgies with female admirers, which Lennon later likened to the scenes of Roman decadence in Frederico Fellini&#x27;s film &quot;Satyricon&quot;.

When the group toured Australia in June, as part of their 1964 world tour, the population afforded the visit the status of a national event. Despite arriving in Sydney on 11 June amid heavy rain, the Beatles were paraded at the airport on an open-top truck. A woman ran across the airport tarmac and threw her intellectually disabled young child into the truck, shouting, &quot;Catch him, Paul!&quot; McCartney did so before telling her the boy was &quot;lovely&quot; and that she should take him back. Once the truck had slowed, the woman kissed her boy and declared: &quot;He&#x27;s better! Oh, he&#x27;s better!&quot; Starr later said that scenes of alleged miracle working by the Beatles were commonplace around the world, including in the UK.

A crowd of 300,000 – roughly half the city – welcomed the Beatles to Adelaide on 12 June. This figure was the largest recorded gathering of Australians in one place, and twice the number of people that had greeted Queen Elizabeth II on her royal visit in 1963. They were given a similar welcome in Melbourne on 14 June. Fans lined the city streets and then lay siege outside the Beatles&#x27; hotel; cars were crushed and 50 people were hospitalised, some having fallen from trees in an attempt to gain a vantage point of their heroes. The Beatles were asked to make an appearance on their hotel balcony in the hope of placating the crowd. The mass of people and sound was reminiscent of film footage of 1930s Nuremberg rallies. According to author Keith Badman, this prompted Lennon to give a Nazi salute &quot;and shout &#x27;Sieg Heil!&#x27;, even holding his finger to his upper lip as a Hitler-style moustache&quot;. Lennon also took to giving crowds an open-palmed benediction in the style of the Pope.

During the first concert in Sydney, on 18 June, the audience&#x27;s habit of hurling Jelly Babies at the stage – a legacy of Harrison saying earlier in the year that he liked Jelly Babies – forced the band to twice stop the show, with McCartney complaining that it was &quot;like bullets coming from all directions&quot;. In addition to the sweets, fans threw miniature koalas and packages as gifts for the band. Hurling objects at the group became a fan ritual carried out wherever the Beatles performed.

The world tour moved on to New Zealand later in the month. There, the authorities expressed their disapproval of the Beatles and their fans&#x27; behaviour by refusing to supply a police escort and by allocating a maximum of three officers to control the thousands of screaming fans outside venues and hotels. In Auckland and Dunedin, the band were left to fight their way through crowds with the help of their road managers, Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall; Lennon was later vocal in his disgust with the local authorities. On 22 June, a young woman broke into the hotel in Wellington where the Beatles were staying, and slashed her wrists when Evans refused her access to the band&#x27;s rooms. Following the Beatles&#x27; arrival in Christchurch on 27 June, a girl threw herself in front of the band&#x27;s limousine and bounced off the car&#x27;s bonnet. Unharmed, she was invited by the group to join them at their hotel.

=== &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;===

The Beatles starred as fictionalised versions of themselves in the feature-length motion picture &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Originally to be titled &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, it portrayed the members as struggling with the trappings of their fame and popularity. The making was complicated by the real-life Beatlemania that arose wherever the crew were shooting on a given day. Some reviewers felt that its concert scene, filmed at a London theatre with an audience of fans who were paid extras, had been deliberately sanitised in its depiction of Beatlemania.

&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; had its world premiere on 6 July, attended by members of the royal family; 12,000 fans filled Piccadilly Circus in central London, which had to be closed to traffic. A separate premiere was held for the north of England on 10 July, for which the Beatles returned to Liverpool. A crowd estimated at 200,000 (a quarter of the city&#x27;s population) lined the streets as the band members were driven to Liverpool Town Hall to meet local dignitaries; once there, in Barry Miles&#x27; description, Lennon &quot;enlivened proceedings by making a series of Hitler salutes to the crowd&quot;.

Stanley highlights the &quot;Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; LP as the album that best demonstrates the band&#x27;s international appeal, saying: &quot;There was adventure, knowingness, love, and abundant charm [in the songs] ... the drug was adrenaline. The world loved them, and the world was their plaything.&quot; The album spent 14 weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart during a 56-week stay – the longest run of any album that year. In the UK, it was number one for 21 weeks and became the second best selling album of the year, behind the group&#x27;s December 1964 release, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, which replaced it at the top of the chart.
===First US tour===

The band returned to the US for a second visit on 18 August 1964, this time remaining for a month-long tour. The Beatles performed 30 concerts in 23 cities, starting in California and ending in New York. One of the major stipulations was that the band would not perform for segregated audiences or at venues which excluded blacks. The tour was characterised by intense levels of hysteria and high-pitched screaming by female fans, both at concerts and during their travels. At each venue, the concert was treated as a major event by the local press and attended by 10,000 to 20,000 fans whose enthusiastic response produced sound levels that left the music only semi-audible.

George Martin, the Beatles&#x27; record producer, assisted in taping the band&#x27;s 23 August Hollywood Bowl concert for a proposed live album; given the audience&#x27;s relentless screaming, he said it was &quot;like putting a microphone at the end of a 747 jet&quot;. When the Beatles played in Chicago on 5 September, a local policeman described the adulation as &quot;kind of like Sinatra multiplied by 50 or 100&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that 160 females were treated for injuries and distress in Vancouver, after thousands of fans charged at the security barriers in front of the stage. At Jacksonville on 11 September, 500 fans kept the Beatles trapped in the George Washington Hotel car park after the group had given a press conference at the hotel. With only a dozen police officers on hand, it took the band 15 minutes to move the 25 feet from the lift to their limousine. Harrison refused to take part in the scheduled ticker-tape parades, given Kennedy&#x27;s assassination the previous year. He said that the constant demand on their time, from fans, city officials, hotel management and others, was such that the band often locked themselves in their hotel bathroom to gain some peace.
The tour earned the group over a million dollars in ticket sales, and stimulated a further increase in record and Beatles-related merchandise sales. Robert Shelton of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticised the Beatles for &quot;creat[ing] a monster in their audience&quot; and said that the band should try to subdue their fans &quot;before this contrived hysteria reaches uncontrollable proportions&quot;. Reports at this time likened the intensity of the fans&#x27; adulation to a religious fervour. Derek Taylor, the band&#x27;s press officer, was quoted in the &quot;New York Post&quot; as saying, &quot;Cripples threw away their sticks [and] sick people rushed up to the car ... It was as if some savior had arrived and all these people were happy and relieved.&quot; In a report from London for the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, Jonathan Miller wrote of the effects of the Beatles&#x27; extended absence overseas: &quot;They have become a religion in fact ... All over the place though there are icons, devotional photos and illuminated messiahs which keep the tiny earthbound fans in touch with the provocatively absconded deities.&quot; American social commentators Grace and Fred Hechinger complained that adults had failed to provide youth with an adequate foundation for their creativity, and they especially deplored the tendency for &quot;creeping adult adolescence&quot;, whereby parents sought to share their children&#x27;s &quot;banal pleasures&quot;.

During the 1964 tour, the Beatles met Bob Dylan in their New York hotel. Lennon later enthused about the meeting; he said that Beatlemania was &quot;something Dylan can understand and relate to&quot; and recalled Dylan explaining the intensity of his following. In his book &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love: The Beatles, Britain, and America&quot;, author Jonathan Gould comments on the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, since the Beatles&#x27; fanbase and that of Dylan were &quot;perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds&quot;. As a result, according to Gould, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts &quot;nearly evaporated&quot; over the following year, as the Beatles&#x27; fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan&#x27;s audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.

Capitol Records exploited the band&#x27;s popularity with a 48-minute documentary double LP &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot;, released in November 1964 and purporting to be a &quot;narrative and musical biography of Beatlemania&quot;. It included a portion of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; from the Hollywood Bowl concert and segments such as &quot;How Beatlemania Began&quot;, &quot;Beatlemania in Action&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Victims&#x27; of Beatlemania&quot;.

===Shea Stadium and 1965 US tour===

The Beatles attended the London premiere of their film &quot;Help!&quot; in July 1965, after completing a two-week tour of France, Italy and Spain, and then returned to the US for another two-week tour. In advance of the tour, the American cultural press published appreciations of the Beatles&#x27; music, marking a turnaround from the dismissiveness shown towards the band in 1964. Written by musicologists, these articles were informed by the media&#x27;s realisation that, rather than a short-term fad, Beatlemania had become more ingrained in society, and by the group&#x27;s influence on contemporary music.
The US tour commenced at Shea Stadium in New York City on 15 August. The circular stadium had been constructed the previous year with seating arranged in four ascending decks, all of which were filled for the concert. It was the first time that a large outdoor stadium had been used for such a purpose and attracted an audience of over 55,000 – the largest of any live concert that the Beatles performed. The event set records for attendance and revenue generation, with takings of $304,000 (equivalent to $ in ). According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the collective scream produced by the Shea Stadium audience escalated to a level that represented &quot;the classic Greek meaning of the word pandemonium – the region of all demons&quot;. The band were astonished at the spectacle of the event, to which Lennon responded by acting in a mock-crazed manner and reducing Harrison to hysterical laughter as they played the closing song, &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;. Starr later said: &quot;I feel that on that show John cracked up ... not mentally ill, but he just got crazy ... playing the piano with his elbows.&quot;

The rest of the tour was highly successful, with well-attended shows on each of its ten dates, most of which took place in stadiums and sports arenas. In Houston, fans swarmed over the wings of the Beatles&#x27; chartered Lockheed Elektra; three days later, one of the plane&#x27;s engines caught fire, resulting in a terrifying ordeal for the band on the descent into Portland. A 50-minute concert film titled &quot;The Beatles at Shea Stadium&quot; was broadcast in the UK in March 1966. In the view of music critic Richie Unterberger, &quot;there are few more thrilling Beatles concert sequences than the [film&#x27;s] &#x27;I&#x27;m Down&#x27; finale&quot;.

Also in 1965, the band&#x27;s influence on American youth was the subject of condemnation by Christian conservatives such as Bob Larson and David Noebel, the latter a Baptist minister and member of the Christian Crusade. In a widely distributed pamphlet titled &quot;Communism, Hypnotism, and the Beatles&quot;, Noebel wrote that patriotic Americans were &quot;in the fight of our lives and the lives of our children&quot;, and urged: &quot;Let&#x27;s make sure four mop-headed anti-Christ beatniks don&#x27;t destroy our children&#x27;s mental and emotional stability and ultimately destroy our nation.&quot; Later that year, Lennon complained about the 1965 US tour: &quot;people kept bringing blind, crippled and deformed children into our dressing room and this boy&#x27;s mother would say, &#x27;Go on, kiss him, maybe you&#x27;ll bring back his sight.&#x27; We&#x27;re not cruel. We&#x27;ve seen enough tragedy in Merseyside ... We&#x27;re going to remain normal if it kills us.&quot;

===&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and December 1965 UK tour===
On 26 October 1965, 4,000 fans gathered outside Buckingham Palace in central London while the Beatles received their MBEs from the Queen. As the crowd chanted &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah!&quot;, some fans jostled with police officers and scaled the palace gates. The impossibility of travelling without being mobbed led to the Beatles abandoning live television appearances to promote their singles. In November, they filmed promotional clips for their double A-side single, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; / &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, which could be played on shows such as &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. This relieved the band from travelling to TV studios around the UK and allowed them to focus on recording their next album, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. In her study of Beatlemania, sociologist Candy Leonard says that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; challenged some young fans, due to its more sophisticated lyrical and musical content, but its release in December 1965 marked the moment when &quot;the Beatles came to occupy a role in fans&#x27; lives and a place in their psyches that was different from any previous fan–performer relationship.&quot;
The LP&#x27;s cover contained a distorted, stretched image of the band&#x27;s faces, which were nevertheless so instantly recognisable that no artist credit was necessary. Its surreal quality led some fans to write to the band&#x27;s official fanzine, &quot;Beatles Monthly&quot;, alarmed that the group&#x27;s appearance resembled that of corpses. Leonard writes that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; initiated &quot;close listening&quot; among the Beatles&#x27; fanbase, particularly with regard to song lyrics, and studying the cover was part of the listening experience. Fans were fascinated by the photo and the change in the band&#x27;s look. In Leonard&#x27;s study, male fans recalled the significance of the band members&#x27; longer hair, individual clothes, and collective self-assuredness. The reaction from female fans varied; one found the cover &quot;very sensual ... they looked grown up and sexy&quot;, while another described it as &quot;scary, difficult, unpleasant&quot;, adding: &quot;They looked menacing, like they were looking down on a victim. They looked like wooly mammoths, brown and leathery.&quot;

In the UK, the release was accompanied by speculation that the group&#x27;s success would soon end, given that most acts there faded after two or three years at the top. The Beatles had also defied convention and Epstein&#x27;s wishes by drastically reducing their concert schedule in 1965, and they disappointed fans by refusing to reprise their annual &quot;Christmas Show&quot; season. During the band&#x27;s UK tour that December, some newspapers reported that the intensity of the fans&#x27; passion appeared to have diminished. In his review of the opening show in Glasgow, Alan Smith of the &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;Crazy Beatlemania is over, certainly&quot;, despite the prevalence of &quot;fainting fits, and thunderous waves of screams&quot;. By the end of the tour, however, following a series of concerts in London, Smith wrote: &quot;without question, BEATLEMANIA IS BACK! ... I have not seen hysteria like this at a Beatles show since the word Beatlemania erupted into headlines!&quot;

==1966: Final tours and controversies==
===Germany, Japan and the Philippines===
After spending three months away from the public eye in early 1966, the Beatles were eager to depart from the formula imposed on them as pop stars, both in their music and in their presentation. Their first full group activity of the year was a photo session with photographer Robert Whitaker, who, having witnessed Beatlemania throughout the 1965 US tour, sought to humanise the band and counter impressions of their iconic status. A photo from this shoot, showing the group dressed in white butchers&#x27; coats and draped with pieces of raw meat and parts from plastic baby dolls, was submitted as the original cover image of a forthcoming US album, &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. In one explanation he subsequently gave, Whitaker said the meat and dismembered limbs symbolised the violence behind Beatlemania and what the band&#x27;s fans would do to them without the presence of heavy security at their concerts.

By 1966, the Beatles were no longer willing to play shows in small venues such as the UK cinemas, but recognised the merit in continuing to perform in large stadiums. They played their final UK show on 1 May 1966 when they performed a short set at the &quot;NME&quot; Poll-Winners Concert, held at the Empire Pool in north-west London. In an opinion poll published in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, 80 per cent of respondents expressed deep disappointment in the group for their paucity of concert, TV and radio appearances, and most of those readers said that Beatlemania was in decline.
After completing the recording for &quot;Revolver&quot; in late June, the Beatles set off on a tour combining concerts in West Germany, Japan and the Philippines. German police used tear gas and guard dogs to control fans in Essen, and in Tokyo, there was fear of terrorism surrounding the band&#x27;s stay, forcing the members to be placed under heavy security in response to death threats from the country&#x27;s hardline traditionalists. While in the Philippines in July, the group unintentionally snubbed first lady Imelda Marcos, who had expected them to attend her breakfast reception at Malacañang Palace in Manila. Epstein had declined the invitation on the band&#x27;s behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. Riots resulted which endangered the group, and they escaped the Philippines with difficulty.

According to author Steve Turner, the three-country tour represented the dark side of Beatlemania and the band&#x27;s fame. Whereas crowds breaking through a police barrier would have been the biggest concern up until the previous year, &quot;Now it was mob revolt, violence, political backlash, and threats of assassination.&quot; In George Harrison&#x27;s recollection:

===&quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;More popular than Jesus&quot; and third US tour===
The Beatles returned to the US on 11 August, shortly after the release of &quot;Revolver&quot;, for what became their last tour. It coincided with a storm of American public protest caused by Lennon&#x27;s remark that the Beatles had become more popular than Christ. Epstein had considered cancelling the 14-concert tour, fearing for their lives because of the severity of the protests, which included Beatles&#x27; records publicly burned and claims that the Beatles were &quot;anti-Christ&quot;. There were disturbances on the tour, and one performance was brought to a temporary halt when a member of the audience threw a firecracker, leading the Beatles to believe that they were being shot at. They received telephone threats, and the Ku Klux Klan picketed some concerts. An ITN news team sent from London to cover the controversy reported that many teenagers in the US Bible Belt were among those offended by the Beatles. Lennon&#x27;s comments had caused no upset when originally published in the UK, in March. However, John Grigg, in his column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, had applied Lennon&#x27;s description of Christ&#x27;s disciples as &quot;thick and ordinary&quot; to the band&#x27;s fans, saying: &quot;Beatle maniacs are a distinct obstacle to higher appreciation of the Beatles.&quot;
When the group arrived in New York, midtown traffic was brought to a standstill as two female fans, perched on a 22nd-storey ledge above Sixth Avenue, threatened to jump unless the Beatles visited them. Outside the Warwick Hotel, where the band stayed, clashes ensued between Christian demonstrators and the crowd of adoring fans. Throughout the tour, the US press nevertheless seized the opportunity to predict the end of Beatlemania, citing the bonfires and radio bans, but also, as detrimental factors to the Beatles&#x27; teenage appeal, the group&#x27;s financial wealth and the artiness of their latest records.

The US tour ended on 29 August with a concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. While commercially successful, the tour had been affected by the prevailing mood of controversy; there were rows of empty seats at some venues and, according to Schaffner, &quot;The screaming had also abated somewhat – one could occasionally even hear snatches of music.&quot; Comparing the 1965 Shea Stadium concert with the previous year&#x27;s event, one commentator recalled that as before, &quot;when the Beatles sang, the looks in the girls&#x27; eyes were faraway&quot;, but &quot;It was different ... This time, we boys were almost as entranced, and the experience was more unifying than dividing.&quot; The band&#x27;s final concert marked the end of a four-year period dominated by touring and concerts, with over 1,400 shows performed worldwide.

By 1966 the Beatles had become disenchanted with all aspects of touring – including fans offering themselves sexually to the band, the high-pitched screaming, and regular confinement in hotel rooms – and they were frustrated that the quality of their live performances was so at odds with the increasingly sophisticated music they created in the studio. Harrison was the first to tire of Beatlemania, while McCartney had continued to thrive on the adulation. McCartney finally ceded to his bandmates&#x27; insistence that the group stop touring towards the end of the 1966 tour. Lennon said that their concerts had become &quot;bloody tribal rites&quot; where crowds came merely to scream. Harrison later likened Beatlemania to the premise of Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;One Flew over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, &quot;where you are sane in the middle of something and they&#x27;re all crackers&quot;. According to Starr, they gave up touring &quot;at the right time&quot;, since &quot;Four years of Beatlemania was enough for anyone.&quot;

==Post-touring fan culture and legacy==

===Response to revamped image and retirement from touring===

The Beatles gave no more commercial concerts from the end of their 1966 US tour until their break-up in 1970, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material in the recording studio. By late 1966, many young fans in the US had temporarily turned away from the Beatles, having found &quot;Revolver&quot; overly austere and lacking the fun aspect they expected of the band&#x27;s music. Sensing this, two aspiring Hollywood filmmakers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider created &quot;The Monkees&quot;, a show starring an eponymous four-piece band in the Beatles&#x27; mould and evoking the spirit of their films &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot; An immediate commercial success, the Monkees captured the teenybopper audience and elicited the frenzied adulation of early Beatlemania. For the younger Beatles fans, a weekly King Features cartoon series, titled &quot;The Beatles&quot;, maintained the innocent &quot;moptop&quot; image of previous years.

Following their final tour, the band members focused on individual interests and projects, and willingly ceded their traditionally dominant position over the Christmas sales period for 1966. The group&#x27;s inactivity and lack of new music was reflected in the results of the end-of-year popularity polls conducted by magazines such as the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and &quot;Bravo&quot;. Their comments to the press also reflected a disillusionment with fame. In a feature article in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Mirror&quot; magazine, Starr was quoted as saying that their image had become a &quot;trap&quot; in which they were pigeonholed as &quot;Siamese quads eating out of the same bowl&quot;, while Lennon said, &quot;We sort of half hope for the downfall. A nice downfall.&quot;
The Beatles issued a double A-side single containing &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; – their first new music since &quot;Revolver&quot; – in February 1967. The accompanying promotional films eschewed performance in favour of avant-garde imagery; they showed the band members&#x27; adoption of facial hair, a detail that challenged the convention for youthful-looking pop stars. The films confused many of their fans and drew unfavourable responses from the audience on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, the leading pop music show in the US. When the single failed to reach number one on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart, British press agencies speculated that the group&#x27;s run of success might have ended, with headlines such as &quot;Beatles Fail to Reach the Top&quot;, &quot;First Time in Four Years&quot; and &quot;Has the Bubble Burst?&quot; However, the American cultural press, responding to appreciations of the Beatles&#x27; artistry in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, lauded the two songs for their experimental qualities. According to author Bernard Gendron, &quot;An adult Beatlemania was in effect replacing the apparently fading &#x27;teenybopper&#x27; Beatlemania, supplanting the screams and rituals of worship with breathless reportage and grandiloquent praise.&quot;

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was released in May and became a major critical and commercial success. According to Gould, the album immediately revolutionised &quot;both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 1963&quot;.
===Final public gatherings===

Beatlemania continued on a reduced scale after the band&#x27;s retirement from live performances and into their solo careers. In late August 1967, 2000 fans protested outside Shea Stadium at the band&#x27;s failure to perform in the US that summer. When the Beatles traveled around the south of England filming their television film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; in September 1967, it was the first opportunity for most members of the public to see the band together in over a year. Gavrik Losey, a production assistant on the film, recalled: &quot;We were staying in a little hotel outside West Malling and the crowd that came pushed in the front window of the hotel ... That level of adoration is just amazing to be around.&quot;

The last mass display of fan adulation took place at the world premiere of the Beatles&#x27; animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, held at the London Pavilion in Piccadilly Circus on 17 July 1968. The event was attended by the four band members and, according to Miles, &quot;Fans as usual brought traffic to a standstill and blocked the streets.&quot; A rare example of the Beatles interacting with fans was when they filmed a promotional clip for their &quot;Hey Jude&quot; single in September 1968, surrounded by a studio audience. Marc Sinden, later an actor and film director, recalled: &quot;It was the days of screaming, but nobody screamed. We were suddenly in the presence of God. That&#x27;s the only way I can describe it. These people had changed history. We grew up with them.&quot;

===Social impact===
The Beatles&#x27; popularity and influence grew into what was seen as an embodiment of socio-cultural movements of the decade. In Gould&#x27;s view, they became icons of the 1960s counterculture and a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women&#x27;s liberation and environmentalism. A 1997 study titled &quot;Beatlemania: A sexually defiant consumer subculture?&quot; argued that Beatlemania represented a proto-feminist demonstration of girl power. In their 1986 book, Ehrenreich, Hess and Jacobs comment that, but for the girls&#x27; hairstyles and clothing, the photos and footage of young Beatles fans in confrontation with police suggest a women&#x27;s liberation demonstration from the late 1960s rather than a 1964 pop event. The authors add: &quot;Yet if it was not the &#x27;movement,&#x27; or a clear-cut protest of any kind, Beatlemania was the first mass outburst of the &#x27;60s to feature women – in this case girls, who would not reach full adulthood until the &#x27;70s – and the emergence of a genuinely political movement for women&#x27;s liberation.&quot; Derek Taylor, the band&#x27;s press officer in 1964 and from 1968 until their break-up, described the relationship between the Beatles and their fans as &quot;the twentieth century&#x27;s greatest romance&quot;.

The first band after the Beatles to receive widespread attention for its fan following in the UK was T.Rex, a glam-rock group led by Marc Bolan. In the early 1970s, the fan frenzy surrounding the band earned comparisons with Beatlemania and became known as &quot;Bolanmania&quot; and &quot;T.Rextasy&quot;. Coincidentally, in the same vein of the british Glam Rock mouvement, David Bowie in 1972-1973 during his Ziggy Stardust Tour, and with 5 albums in the UK charts according to the press reach a Beatle-like popularity in the UK. Later in the decade, the British press coined the term &quot;Rollermania&quot; for female fans&#x27; adulation of the Bay City Rollers. Writing in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2013, Dorian Lynskey said, &quot;the tropes of Beatlemania have recurred in fan crazes from the Bay City Rollers to Bros, East 17 to One Direction: the screaming, the queuing, the waiting, the longing, the trophy-collecting, the craving for even the briefest contact.&quot; In their book &quot;Encyclopedia of Classic Rock&quot;, David Luhrssen and Michael Larson state that while boy bands such as One Direction continue to attract audiences of screaming girls, &quot;none of those acts moved pop culture forward or achieved the breadth and depth of the Beatles&#x27; fandom.&quot; André Millard similarly writes that, just as Beatlemania&#x27;s &quot;scale and ferocity&quot; far surpassed the scenes of adulation inspired by Sinatra, Presley and Johnnie Ray, &quot;nobody in popular entertainment has been able to repeat this moment in all its economic and cultural significance.&quot;

<text>Marie Joseph Pierre François Kœnig or Koenig (10 October 1898 – 2 September 1970) was a French general during World War II during which he commanded a Free French Brigade at the Battle of Bir Hakeim in North Africa in 1942. He started a political career after the war and was posthumously elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France in 1984.

== Early life ==
Marie-Pierre Kœnig was born on 10 October 1898, in Caen, Calvados, France. His parents were from the Alsace region.

== Military career ==
=== World War I ===
Kœnig fought in the French Army during World War I and served with distinction. He obtained his baccalaureate and enlisted in 1917. He served in the 36th Infantry Regiment. He was designated as an aspirant in February 1918 and joined his unit at the front. Decorated with the Médaille militaire, he was promoted to &quot;sous-lieutenant&quot; on 3 September 1918.

=== Interwar career===
After the war, he served with French forces in Morocco and Cameroon. He served in Silesia as an assistant () of Captain in the Alps, in Germany, and in Morocco at the general staff headquarters of the division of Marrakesh.

=== World War II ===
Kœnig was a captain and assistant to Lieutenant-Colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey in the 13th Demi-Brigade of Foreign Legion of the French Foreign Legion.

When World War II broke out, Kœnig returned to France. In 1940, he was assigned as a captain with the French troops in Norway for which he was later awarded Norway&#x27;s &quot;Krigskorset med Sverd&quot;, or the War Cross with Sword, in 1942. After the fall of France, he escaped to England from Brittany.
In London, Kœnig joined General Charles de Gaulle and was promoted to colonel. He became chief of staff in the first divisions of the Free French Forces. In 1941, he served in the campaigns in Syria and Lebanon. He was later promoted to general and took command of the First French Brigade in Egypt. His unit of 3700 men held ground against five Axis divisions (c. 37,000 men) for 16 days at the Battle of Bir Hakeim until they were ordered to evacuate on 11 June 1942. De Gaulle said to Kœnig, &quot;Know and tell your troops that all of France is watching you and that you are its pride.&quot;

Later, Kœnig served as the Free French delegate to the Allied headquarters under General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1944, he was given command of the Free French who participated in the Invasion of Normandy. Kœnig also served as a military advisor to de Gaulle. In June 1944, he was given command of the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) to unify the various French Resistance groups under de Gaulle&#x27;s control. Under his command, the FFI abandoned ranged battle in the maquis and preferred sabotage that was waged in support of the invading army. Important during D-Day, the FFI had a role that became decisive in the battle for Normandy and in the landing in Provence of the US Seventh Army and French Army B.

On 21 August 1944, de Gaulle appointed Kœnig military governor of Paris to restore law and order. In 1945, he was sent to arrest Marshal Philippe Pétain, who had taken refuge in Germany but gave himself up at the frontier with Switzerland.

=== Cold War ===
After the war, Kœnig was the military governor of the French occupation zone in Germany from 1945 to 1949. In 1949, he became inspector general in North Africa, and in 1950, he became the vice-president of the Supreme War Council.

== Political career ==

In 1951, after his retirement from the army, Kœnig was elected as Gaullist representative to the French National Assembly and briefly served as Minister of Defense under Pierre Mendès-France (1954) and Edgar Faure (1955).

He gave his strong support to the new State of Israel as president of the Franco-Israeli Committee (&quot;Comité franco-israélien&quot;), at around the same time when he was France&#x27;s Defense Minister, as shown from his informing his Israeli counterpart Shimon Peres that France was willing to sell Israel any weapons it wished to purchase, from small arms to tanks (such as the AMX-13 light tank). Kœnig had witnessed the heroism of a battalion of Palestinian Jewish mine layers during the Battle of Bir Hakeim and afterwards allowed them to fly their own Star-of-David flag, against British regulations.

== Death ==
Kœnig died on 2 September 1970, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, and was buried at Montmartre Cemetery, in Paris.

== Legacy ==
There are streets named after Kœnig in Jerusalem, Netanya and Haifa.

<doc id="844493" wikidata="Q7337517" url="?curid=844493" title="River Ingrebourne">
<text>The River Ingrebourne is a tributary of the River Thames 27 miles (43.3 km) in length. It is considered a strategic waterway in London, forming part of the Blue Ribbon Network. It flows through the London Borough of Havering roughly from north to south, joining the Thames at Rainham.

==Etymology==
The name is recorded in 1062 as &quot;Ingceburne&quot; and its suffix is a form of the Old English &#x27;burna&#x27;, meaning , a type of stream. The meaning of the prefix is unclear, although it could refer to a person.

==Description==
The Ingrebourne rises near Brentwood, Essex, whence it flows in a southwesterly direction under the M25 motorway through the London Borough of Havering in north east London. The river passes under the motorway near Junction 28, where the first of its tributaries, the 2.7 miles (4.3 km) long Weald Brook joins, followed shortly by Carters Brook and Paynes Brook. After skirting south of the built-up area of Harold Hill, the route passes under the Great Eastern Main Line. From here it is partly non-urban: a large area of flood-plain follows before the Ingrebourne threads between the suburbs of Upminster and Hornchurch.
The river from here is surrounded by public open space: with Gaynes Parkway, the Ingrebourne Valley Greenway and Hornchurch Country Park taking up the area until reaching Rainham. Here the river divides, the main channel becoming Rainham Creek, where it flows into the Thames between Hornchurch Marshes (to the west) and Rainham Marshes (to the east) at Old Man&#x27;s Head. The second channel becomes the Wennington Sewers complex.

==Significance==
The Ingrebourne Marshes are a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of the diversity of its wildlife and extensive areas of wetland reeds. The river forms one of the strategic waterways identified in the Blue Ribbon Network policy in the London Plan. The Ingrebourne Valley is a Local Nature Reserve.

<doc id="844497" wikidata="Q1687708" url="?curid=844497" title="Yeruham">
<text>Yeruham () is a town in the Southern District of Israel, in the Negev desert. It covers , and had a population of in . It is named after the Biblical Jeroham.

Until early 2011 the mayor of Yeruham was Amram Mitzna, and he was succeeded by Michael Biton of Kadima, who was elected mayor in November 2010. In 2018, dark horse candidate Tal Ohana was elected the first female mayor of Yeruham.

For many years, Yeruham was economically depressed and suffered from image problems, but major efforts to improve the quality of life took place during the early 2000s.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Yeruham is the site of Tel Rahma, dating back to the 10th century BCE. On the outskirts of Yeruham is an ancient well, Be&#x27;er Rahma.

During the Nabatean, Roman and Byzantine periods there was a village in the western outskirts of the town and its ruins can be seen today. The site, known Qasr Rekhmeh or Mesad Yeruham, was excavated in 1966 by R. Cohen.

===Modern era===

Modern Yeruham was founded on 9 January 1951 as &quot;Kfar Yeruham&quot; and was one of Israel&#x27;s first development towns, created to settle frontier areas in the early days of the state. It was located near the Large Makhtesh, an area thought at the time to be rich with natural resources.

At the head of the settlement was Pinchas Maanit (Muchnik), one of the founders of Nahalal, who moved to the place with his family after Ben-Gurion request to assist and help to settle and establish new home to Israeli new-comers. The crossing was established in the area where the Bedouins migrated from Mata al-Azama, some of whose residents now live in Rekha, an unknown village located in the Yeruham area.

In 1959, the settlement was dismantled, and a permanent settlement was established in its place, which was declared a local council. Maanit continued to serve as head of the council. Two years later, another settlement was established in the settlement, and almost 3000 residents were added.
The first influx of olim (Jewish immigrants) came from Romania, many of them Holocaust survivors, followed by immigrants from North Africa, Iran, India and elsewhere, who make up the majority of the town&#x27;s population today (appr. 40%, 5%, 20%, 10% respectively). By 1961, the town&#x27;s population was 1,574. In 1962, when about 1,700 residents lived in the settlement, the name was changed to Yeruham.

Yeruham was founded on the Petroleum Road in the Negev desert and its initial growth was stymied by the construction of Highway 25 and the Beersheba – Mitzpe Ramon section of Highway 40, which created a new route to Eilat and made the Petroleum Road obsolete. Because of these factors, in addition to Yeruham&#x27;s distance from the center of the country, many young people left its territory and it suffered for many years from negative immigration.
Since autumn 1990, Yeruham had actively been involved in absorbing hundreds of olim from the former USSR, who came to comprise 25% of the town&#x27;s nearly 10,000 residents. In recent years, young couples and families from other localities have moved to Yeruham, and some have purchased lots and built their homes in the town&#x27;s new neighborhoods.

Members of the Young People in Yeruham Student Settlement Group are involved in local social action projects, organize cultural events for young people, and attract young people to settle in Yeruham. In April 2008, the Ayalim Student Village opened in Yeruham to allow students in Negev institutions of higher education to live and volunteer in the town. North American students from Nativ College Leadership Program engage in volunteer community service in Yeruham every spring. They help teach English in the local high schools and yeshivot, work with the Magen David Adom ambulance corps, teach in preschools and much more.

==Geography==

Yeruham is situated in the northern Negev, 15 km from Dimona, 600 meters above sea level.

It is located within the Negev desert and has erosion cirques or ‘craters’ and close by is the Yeruham Iris Nature Reserve, where the rare native iris &quot;Iris petrana&quot; is found.

==Economy==
The main employers are local and regional industry (53% of employed residents) and services and commerce. Most of those are employed in industry work in local factories such as Agis-Perrigo (Careline cosmetics and pharmaceuticals), Negev Ceramics, Phoenicia Glass Works (which moved to Yeruham from Haifa in 1968) Brand Metals, Ackerstein, Yehu Clays, TTK electronics, and Tempo (some of which utilize raw materials from the region). The rest of those employed work in the surrounding region in companies such as, Ramat Hovav, Negev Nuclear Research Center, Dead Sea Works, Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheva, Ben-Gurion University, and in Sde Boker. Yeruham has suffered in the past from high unemployment rates, although today the rate is lower than the national average.

Tourism projects include development of the Lake Park around Yeruham Dam and Large Makhtesh. Professional training programs in computers, chemistry, engineering and other fields needed by industry. Local industrial zones have doubled in size and offer space for rental and construction.

Up to 2011, residential construction in Yeruham had been done in a non-profit manner, either by Amidar or the residents themselves. In anticipation of military personnel moving into Yeruham to server in the future adjacent City of Training Bases, land had been released for private for-profit construction.

In 2015, a tech incubator, MindCET, was established in Yeruham as a center for leadership and innovation in educational technology to foster specialized cooperation between entrepreneurs, researchers, teachers and students. MindCET operates a high-tech accelerator for edtech startups.

==Education==
Yeruham has 5 elementary schools (State-General and State-Religious), 3 Ultra-Orthodox schools, and a comprehensive high school affiliated with ORT. Since the inauguration of the &quot;Anyone Can Do It&quot; program, the number of high school students eligible for Bagrut matriculation certificates has risen. All schools in Yeruham use GBS, an online system which enables pupils to work at home on material from school. The &quot;City Plays Music&quot; program provides music education in all the elementary schools, and operates two youth orchestras.

Bilvav Shalem high school yeshiva for boys and Kamah junior high for girls attract pupils from all over the country. Yeshivat HaHesder Yerucham (institute of higher Jewish religious education for men combining study with army service), also attracts students from all over the country and runs a special leadership program for Ethiopian young men. Midreshet Be&#x27;er offers a post-high school track for young religious women that combines study with community volunteering. The women do two years of IDF or National Service, and a final half-year of social action projects in Yeruham.

Education and training for over-30 adults are coordinated by the Ofek Center for Human Resources Development.

Joint programs with the Weizmann Institute, Ben-Gurion University, the Open University, the Hebrew University Center for Enrichment in Education, and volunteer tutoring by scientists at the Nuclear Research Center aim to improve educational achievements and provide enrichment, especially in the sciences.

==Culture ==

The Yeruham &quot;Matnas&quot; (local community center) organizes plays, performances, summer events, music lessons, sports activities, nature-oriented extracurricular activities, neighborhood clubs, immigrant absorption activities, a Yiddish choir and communal theater group. The library has 60,000 books in Hebrew, Russian and English, and offers enrichment activities for pre-school and elementary school students, meetings with authors, computer training, workshops for parents and children and creative writing groups.

The Matnas Youth Department runs the Machsan 52 youth club, youth rock bands and two youth councils (for different age groups). The Israeli scout movement Tzofim and Bnai Akiva both have branches in the city. Midreshet Beyahad Seminar Center and youth hostel arranges hikes, workshops and other programming for visiting groups, mainly students, as well as Jewish programming in local schools.

Other cultural programs are the Teudat Zehut Yeruham project for community empowerment through documentation and the Bamidbar Regional Center for creative, pluralistic Judaism.

<text>Old Oscott (originally Oscott) is an area of Great Barr, Birmingham, England (previously in the parish of Handsworth, Staffordshire). The suburb forms a triangle bounded to the north by Pheasey, to the west by Perry Beeches, and to the east by Kingstanding. The Birmingham City Council ward that covers the area is called simply Oscott.

The area has been known locally as &quot;Old&quot; Oscott since St. Mary&#x27;s College, the Roman Catholic seminary, moved to a new site in an area that became known as New Oscott.

The area was mostly developed between 1920 and 1960, with a mix of both private and council housing.

Old Oscott F.C. takes its name from the area.

<doc id="844518" wikidata="Q7271397" url="?curid=844518" title="Queslett">
<text>Queslett is an area of Great Barr, Birmingham, England.

The name (originally Quieslade) has been in use since the 16th century. The first part, from &quot;Queest&quot;, means a wood pigeon, the second comes from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;slade&quot;, for a small valley. Another old spelling, Queeslet, appears on Victorian maps and postcards.

The area was part of Staffordshire until 1928.

In 1810, in &quot;A Complete History of the Druids&quot;, T G Lomax described the area:

(the later being a reference to Robert Plot&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Staffordshire&quot;).

The area was mostly developed with private housing from the 1930s onwards, and is centred on the A4041 Queslett Road between West Bromwich and Sutton Coldfield, overlooked by Barr Beacon. A former sand quarry, on the site of William Booth&#x27;s farm, was subsequently used for landfill. One half of the site is now Queslett Nature Reserve. The Moonstones, an artwork commemorating The Lunar Society, who met at nearby Great Barr Hall, stands in the grounds of a supermarket, on the site of the quarry&#x27;s former office.

<text>Perry Beeches is an area of Great Barr, Birmingham, England, within the parliamentary constituency of Birmingham Perry Barr. It was formerly part of the estate of Perry Hall, and from 1894 until 1928 came under the auspices of Perry Barr Urban District, in Staffordshire.

The area takes its name from a 17th-century house, &quot;The Beeches&quot;, which was demolished circa 1960 after the current vicarage of St Matthew&#x27;s Church had been built alongside it.

Previously agricultural (the forger William Booth (died 1812) farmed in the area), with some sand and gravel quarrying to the north, in the area known as Queslett, between Aldridge and Queslett Roads; it was developed as a residential suburb of Birmingham immediately before and after World War II. Many of the houses in the Thornbridge Avenue and Booth&#x27;s Farm Road areas were constructed before the outbreak of war, while the remaining part of the estate (between the Beeches and Aldridge Roads) was completed after 1945. The oldest extant buildings are two farm cottages, constructed in 1910, now serving as offices adjacent to Brooklyn Garage. The Perry Beeches area is bisected by the M6 motorway, constructed in the early 1970s. The Tame Valley Canal, constructed in 1844, marks the area&#x27;s southern boundary, with a bridge over the canal, now prohibited to motor vehicles, linking it to Perry Barr Park.

The housing in the southern part of Perry Beeches—an area known as The Beeches Estate, around Thornbridge Avenue and at the eastern end of the Beeches Road (formerly known as Brick Kiln Lane)—was built by Henry Boot of Sheffield for the First National Housing Trust (Boot also built a similar estate, albeit with houses of a slightly larger floorplan, at Pheasey, to the north-east of the Beeches Estate on land that was part of Aldridge Urban District Council and now part of Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council). Most of these houses were built in blocks of 4–6 with some blocks of 2 semi-detached in a similar style where space would not allow for larger blocks, or where the land was too steep for these blocks - notably in Holmesfield Road; that was built on a steep hill.

While many residents have now bought these properties and made many alterations, the original floorplan for most houses consisted of a hallway, front room and then a rear kitchen with pantry, coal hole and a downstairs toilet. As these houses were originally rented, they had identical wooden doors and windows painted cream, with either dark green or brown doors and outer frames. Wooden fences with a garden hedge were also placed around every house.

The houses to the north of the area (north of the Beeches Road between Walsall Road and the M6) were by contrast privately owned. These are mostly blocks of semi-detached houses with generally more decorative features, including large circular bay windows on the upper and ground floor, stained glass front doors and windows, and in most cases both a front and back reception room.

At the rear of most houses in the Walsall Road and Booths Farm Road area, the houses were built with long rear access &#x27;right of ways&#x27;. These proved useful as more people owned a private car from the early 1950s onwards and were able to build a garage on the bottom part of their back garden plot opening onto these &#x27;right of ways&#x27;. They also made good short-cuts. In recent years, however, these became good access routes for burglars breaking into garages and houses. Due to this, many now have large padlocked gates at their roadside entrance and are only accessible to residents.

There are a number of primary schools around this area and two secondary schools with one, Arena Academy (the former Perry Beeches Secondary School), being directly located on the Beeches Estate. Further education is provided at the James Watt campus of Birmingham Metropolitan College, formerly Brooklyn Technical College.

Evidence of Bramley&#x27;s first inhabitants can be found in Bullsdown Camp, a prehistoric settlement, where remnants of flint-scrapers, a spear-head, a core and flint-flakes have been found. This is thought to be a late Celtic &quot;triple-walled dun&quot;. This fortification can still be seen today, situated to the east of the village south of the Bramley to Sherfield road. 

The Romans occupied Calleva Atrebatum and built a walled city known today as Silchester. Bramley is on the Chichester to Silchester Way Roman road and has remains of a Romano-British villa nearby.

Bramley is listed as a significant settlement in the 1086 Domesday Survey, with 39 households, in the hundred of Basingstoke. Included in its resources were two mills, a church and woodlands, ploughlands and meadows with a total value of £9.

The Reverend Robert Toogood wrote a history of the village and church. It includes some anecdotes about King Henry VIII&#x27;s connections with the village and Cufaude Manor.

The Church of St James stands at the west of the village and originally dates from 1160, however it features many historical alterations and additions up to the 20th Century. It is a Grade I listed building. St James&#x27; church, Bramley, Hampshire. Within the church, images were uncovered which dated back to the pre-Reformation. The famous physicist Lise Meitner is buried in the burial ground next to the church, near the grave of her brother Walter.

The railway line between Reading and Basingstoke was built through the village in 1848. The village had to wait another 47 years until on 1 May 1895 a station in the village opened, at the insistence of the then Duke of Wellington, a prominent landowner in the area. During 1935 parts of the film &#x27;The Last Journey&#x27; were shot on the railway within the village.

==Geography==
Bramley is located south of the large town of Reading, and north of Basingstoke. The village is the site of Bramley (Hants) railway station, on the line between Reading and Basingstoke, and is served by Great Western Railway&#x27;s local services. The station is north of Basingstoke.

==Governance==
The civil parish of Bramley includes the village of Bramley and the neighbouring settlements of Bramley Green and Bramley Corner. The village is also part of the Bramley and Sherfield ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council. All three councils are responsible for different aspects of local government.

At Borough level, Bramley is represented by Councillors Nicholas Robinson and Venitia Rowland who, together, represent the Bramley and Sherfield Ward.

At County level, Bramley is represented by Keith Chapman, who represents the Calleva and Kingsclere Division.

==Army training area==

Bramley Camp is a military training area south of the village, used mainly by 21 SAS (reserves). The camp has also been used to shoot parts of the Channel 4 television series &quot;Scrapheap Challenge,&quot; and the ITV1 series &quot;Midsomer Murders.&quot; Because the site is not open to the public and in many ways is undisturbed; it is a valuable haven for wildlife, being home to badgers, deer and pheasant.

<text>The Japanese kitchen () is the place where food is prepared in a Japanese house. Until the Meiji era, a kitchen was also called &quot;kamado&quot; (; lit. stove) and there are many sayings in the Japanese language that involve kamado as it was considered the symbol of a house. The term could even be used to mean &quot;family&quot; or &quot;household&quot; (much as &quot;hearth&quot; does in English). Separating a family was called &quot;kamado wo wakeru&quot;, or &quot;divide the stove&quot;. &quot;Kamado wo yaburu&quot; (lit. &quot;break the stove&quot;) means that the family was broken.

==Early history==
In the Jōmon period, from the 10,000 BC to 300 BC, people gathered into villages, where they lived in shallow pit dwellings. These simple huts were between 10 and 30 square meters and had a hearth in the center. Early stoves were nothing more than a shallow pit (&quot;jishōro&quot; 地床炉), but they were soon surrounded by stones to catch the fire sparks. A bottomless clay vase soon replaced the stones as these became hot quickly and occupants had to be careful around a stove. This type of stove is called &quot;maiyōro&quot; (埋甕炉; lit. &quot;buried vase stove&quot;). As the stove became safer, it was moved from the center of house to the side and, by the late Kofun period (6th century), almost all houses had a stove at one end of the house. Some rich families in the Kofun period built a separate house where cooking was done. In these houses, food was stored in sacks and pots in a hole dug on the floor. Houses were constructed near a river or a spring for easy access to water.

In the Yayoi period (300 BC to AD 250) the cultivation of rice became widespread, and villages would be constructed near a marsh and a lowland. The water was muddy and &quot;asaido&quot; (浅井戸), which means a shallow well, were constructed. An asaido was filled with sand and pebbles through which the water flowed to filter out mud and larger organisms. Some villages stored food outside a house in a large storehouse.

The kitchen remained unchanged for over 500 years, between the Nara period in the 8th century until the Muromachi period (1336–1573). Kitchens were furnished with the following items:
*&quot;Ashikanae&quot; or &quot;Ashimarokanae&quot; (足釜) - A nine- or ten-legged iron pot.
*&quot;Kakekanae&quot; or &quot;Kakemarokanae&quot; (懸釜) - An iron pot that was fitted over a stove. It had a &quot;fringe&quot; that let it hang on the stove and was used to boil cook rice into kayu.
*&quot;Yukikamado&quot; (行竈) - A pot, with a stove attached, that could be carried around
*&quot;Koshiki&quot; (橧 or 甑) - A wooden basket placed on top of a pot to steam cook rice.
*&quot;Nabe&quot; (堝 or 鍋) - made of clay or of metal. Primarily used to make stews and a side dish as well as to boil water.
*&quot;Sashinabe&quot; or &quot;Sasunabe&quot; (銚子, 刺名倍 or 佐志奈閇) - A small pot with a long handle used to warm sake in a bottle.
*&quot;Hiraka&quot; or &quot;Hotogi&quot; (瓫) - A large clay pot, larger than a nabe, used to boil water.
*&quot;Kamado&quot; - Also called &quot;Mushikamado&quot;: the stove itself, constructed with stones, tiles, and clay.
*&quot;Karakamado&quot; (韓竈) - A set of koshiki, &quot;kanahe&quot; (釜), and kamado that can be carried around.
*&quot;Takigi&quot; (薪) - In the Nara period, &quot;薪&quot; was read as &quot;takigi&quot; not &quot;maki&quot;. Dried wood was used as fuel.
*&quot;Oke&quot; (麻筒) - A tub or a pail in three sizes: large, medium, and small. A flat bottomed and shallow tub was also used.
*&quot;Shaku&quot; (杓) - Also read as &quot;Hisago&quot;. A wooden ladle used to scoop cold and hot water from an &quot;oke&quot;.
*&quot;Katana&quot; (刀子) - A cooking knife and not a katana.
*&quot;Kiritsukue&quot; or &quot;Sekki&quot; (切机) - A &quot;Manaita&quot; (俎) or a cutting board.
*&quot;Fune&quot; (船) - A large wooden tub used for washing.
*&quot;Shitami&quot; (籮) - A coarse hemp cloth used to squeeze water out or to dry foods by spreading over it.
*&quot;Kame&quot; (甕) - A large vase where foods were stored.

In the Heian period (794–1185), the first usage of the precursor to &quot;daidokoro&quot;, or pantry, was recorded. The imperial palace of Heian had four rooms dedicated to preparing foods, &quot;oni no ma&quot; (鬼の間), &quot;daibandokoro&quot; (台盤所), &quot;asagarei no ma&quot; (朝餉の間), and &quot;Ōidono&quot; (大炊殿). &quot;Oni no ma&quot; was the room used for checking for poison and tasting before serving. &quot;Asagarei no ma&quot; was the room for eating breakfast. &quot;Ōidono&quot; was the room to cook foods and was placed to the north and as far away as possible from living quarters. &quot;Daibandokoro&quot; was the room used to serve foods onto a &quot;daiban&quot; (台盤), a lacquered wooden table. Maid servants also ate and waited to serve meals in the daibandokoro.
In the Kamakura period (1185–1333), as the Shoinzukuri style of housing became common, the kitchen was gradually absorbed into the house. Until then, a kitchen was built as a separate house whenever possible to avoid smells and smoke, and to prevent possible kitchen fires from spreading to the primary residence. Kamakura era kitchens did not include essential kitchen furnishings, such as a sink or a well.

==Fire and water==

===Stoves===

The earliest dwellings in Japan used an open fire hearth for cooking. The first stove was recorded in the Kofun period, between the 3rd to 6th century. These stoves, called &quot;kamado&quot;, were typically made of clay and sand; they were fired through a hole in the front and had a hole in the top, into which a pot could be suspended from its rim. This type of stove remained in use for centuries to come, with only minor modifications. In the 14th century, in the Muromachi period, stoves with two holes were recorded in drawings. By the early 17th century, the beginning of the Edo period, large stoves with several cooking holes were common in the kitchens of the upper-class house as well as in large restaurants. It is believed these multiple hole types appeared earlier than recorded but were omitted from drawings of the time because inclusion of a single hole stove was sufficient to indicate a kitchen. The stove was low, meaning cooks had to squat to cook. In the larger kitchens, especially those of palaces and temples, raised &quot;kamado&quot; that could be operated while standing up were developed in the Edo period (1603–1867).

&quot;Irori&quot; (囲炉裏、いろり) appeared in the Kofun period and served as a secondary stove. A section of wooden panels were removed from the floor and a lacquered square wooden frame was fitted in the place. The frame was filled with sand and an iron hook was lowered from the ceiling. Foods were reheated or cooked over in an iron pot hung from a hook and the fire served as a heat source. This type of stove became common in many homes by the early Nara period and a smaller irori is the center piece of a tea house.

A third type of stove, a &quot;hibachi&quot; (火鉢, ひばち) lit. &quot;fire pot&quot;, appeared as late as the early Heian period but is likely to have been used earlier. A hibachi is a deep small pot half filled with sand and ash and a small fire was started in the pot. It was used as a safer form of heating equipment than was available previously and could be used to cook small morsels of food.

===Water===

Fire was a part of a kitchen from the start, but water was late in becoming a part.

In the Yayoi period (300 B.C. to A.D. 250), the cultivation of rice became widespread, and villages would be constructed near a marsh and a lowland. The water was muddy and &quot;asaido&quot; (浅井戸) lit.) shallow wells, were constructed. An asaido was filled with sand and pebbles through which the water flowed to filter out mud and larger organisms. A deeper well was also dug and sometimes a hollowed log was inserted into the well to prevent the walls&#x27; collapse. A pot was used to scoop water.

It was not long before people started improving on these primitive wells. The area around a well was tiled with stones, then &quot;fune&quot; (水船) was invented. Wooden or bamboo shafts were used to carry water from nearby wells and springs to a fune, or it was manually filled by women. Water was carried from these fune to a water vase whence it was used. Sometimes a fune was made inside a house, but it did not have the function of a sink. It was used to collect and store water and nothing more. Fune later became a part of a Japanese garden.

The first time that a sink appeared in a drawing was in the &quot;Bokie&quot; (慕帰絵) written in the early Muromachi period. The kitchen of the Nanrou temple (南瀧院) had a large &quot;sunokoyuka&quot; (すのこ床) lit. drainboard floor, next to a stove with a water filled &quot;oke&quot; and &quot;hisyaku&quot; (&quot;syaku&quot;) for washing. This sunokoyuka was made with split bamboo and water would drain through gaps between the canes. Even though in many places a sunokoyuka was made over a river and washing was done, to make a part of the kitchen floor into sunokoyuka to use as a drain was an innovation. This did not pose a health problem as kitchen scraps were meticulously collected and used to make a compost. Few Japanese ate meat due to the Emperor&#x27;s decree in the 8th century and animals and birds were slaughtered away from a house. Until late Edo period, this type of kitchen was widely used.

==Shoin-zukuri and the kitchen==
Shoin-zukuri became the standard style of building a house beginning in the 13th century and it was revolutionary for combining fire (stove) and water (well and drain) into a single place. It was still few steps short of a kitchen. In the early stage of Shoinzukuri style, instead of the kitchen being a room inside the &quot;omoya&quot; (母屋) or the main building, it was connected by a corridor and existed inside one of many sub-buildings. However, it did have a &quot;kamado&quot;, a &quot;irori&quot;, a well, and a &quot;sunokoyuka&quot; in the same room.

In the Edo period (1603 to 1868), &quot;daidokoro&quot; came to mean &quot;kitchen&quot; and became an integrated part of the house. It was, however, more common to call it &quot;katte&quot; (勝手) which is used to mean the &quot;back door.&quot; The pantry room was called &quot;ozentate&quot; (御膳立). Upper-class houses were well stocked and extremely large by today&#x27;s standard. The country house of Tokugawa Mitsukuni, known as a gourmet of Edo period, had kitchen spaces at least 34 &quot;jyou&quot; or about 53 square metres. This is more than one-third of the entire house and does not include the sake storage room or the pantry. Some kitchens had running water by having bamboo shafts connected to the water source extend into the kitchen; users of less well equipped kitchens fetched water from a common well. A separate kitchen within the house had become customary and all but the smallest single-room houses had one.

Storage in kitchens was provided by &quot;mizuya tansu&quot;. These are Japanese style chests, often with a mix of compartments behind sliding doors and drawers of varying sizes. These are still available today as antiques, or altered reproductions tailored to a more modern/western style of kitchen.

==Industrialization==
An American scientist, Edward S. Morse, recorded many of the kitchens in urban and rural areas in the early Meiji period (1868–1912). These kitchens were not much different from those in the Edo period as home use of gas and electricity had only just begun in America and Europe. Though it was costly to lay down infrastructures, these were dutifully laid down, with heavy subsidization by semi-private and national companies.

The early 1900s brought a change in Japanese cuisine. Foreign cuisines from every part of the world flooded Japanese cookbooks, part of the &quot;haikara&quot; boom (ハイカラ, literally high collared, taken from high-collared coats popular in Europe). Popular dishes like curried rice, sukiyaki, ramen, and gyūdon appeared during the Meiji period as a part of the haikara movement and represented a fusing of traditional Japanese cuisines with other cuisines. Kitchens were completely reorganized to cook these foods; kitchens of the Edo period were used for simple menus of rice, broiled fish, vegetable soup, and pickled vegetables.

The first gas light was installed in Yokohama by 1873, but it would be more than 30 years before advertisements for the gas started appearing in newspapers. These ads were not directed at middle to lower classes. In the 1908 study of how gas was used in Tokyo, 57% was for lighting, 14% was for fuel, 19% was for powering motors, and 3% was for streetlights. This meant that gas was used to light only 1 out of 9 households and only 1 out of 100 households used gas for cooking. Gas companies realized this, and early appliances were directly imported from England which made them too costly for all but the richest citizens.

The Japanese kitchen turned away from American and European kitchens at this point. The first item of the industrialization to be introduced to most houses was the gas-heated rice cooker. A gas stove were introduced much later as the cost of gas was still too high for most homes. A gas oven, often an essential part of the kitchen in many American and European houses, never made it into most Japanese households because dishes requiring cooking in an oven, such as roasted chicken and baked pies, became popular only much later. Instead of an oven, a smaller fish oven was fitted into a gas stove. The gas-heated rice cooker remained in use until the 1970s in many houses and was eventually replaced by the electric rice cooker.

In the 1920s, electricity became more widespread in homes in Japan. In &quot;Nihonkatei daihyakkajiten&quot; (literally &quot;Encyclopedia of Japanese Household&quot;) published in 1927, there is already an entry of &quot;katei denka&quot; meaning a completely electric house. It says,

:The most important reason to use electricity for all needs of a house, lighting, heat, power is because it will help women to work, increasing their efficiency, make living easier and comfortable, and also make it economical. There must be several electrical outlets in each room to easily use an appliance like electric heater. They also let occupants use electric light at any time and no one can forget the comfort of using appliances like an electric fan, an electric heater, an electric toaster, a coffee maker, an electric iron, and an electric curling iron.

:...Placing various electric appliances (in a kitchen) and cooking with them is essential to making it easier to work in this small space. An electric stove, an electric oven, an electric refrigerator, an electric dishwashers, etc. must be wired properly in appropriate spaces.

This, however, did not mean that a completely electric house had become common. In 1937, J. G. Douglass from General Electric conducted a half-year research on how many electric appliances made into a common household. According to this report:

* Electric iron - 3,131,000 (approximately 120,000 in Tokyo area)
* Refrigerator - 12,215 (4,700)
* Room cooler - 260 (125)
* Vacuum cleaner - 6,610 (3,100)
* Washing machine - 3,197 (1,590)

This research project also predicted that four years later, in 1941, electric appliances should be much more widely used. A 490% increase was predicted for the refrigerator, 470% increase for the vacuum cleaner, and 150% increase for iron.

The first public water service began on October 17, 1887, in Yokohama. By the early 1900s, most major cities had water services. However, these water pipes often led to public water taps. In 1892, a survey conducted in Yokohama revealed that less than 1 in 4 households had a private water tap. 18,184 households used public water taps, while only 5,120 household used private water taps. By the 1930s, most new houses were constructed with a private water taps, but it would take another 30 years to become available in a village far from a city.

==The &quot;ordinary person&#x27;s dream kitchen&quot;==
In 1912, a progressive woman&#x27;s magazine &quot;Fujin no tomo&quot; (婦人の友) ran a contest for a &quot;heiminteki risouno daidokoro&quot; (平民的理想の台所), or &quot;ordinary people&#x27;s sophisticated kitchen.&quot; &quot;Heimin,&quot; literally &quot;average person,&quot; was a popular phrase in the 1910s and 1920s, and it implied a well-educated and progressive person. Fifty-two contest entries were sent by readers, and two were awarded grand prizes. These winners were called &quot;the city kitchen&quot; and &quot;the village kitchen&quot;.

The city kitchen was about 15.5 square metres in size and was intended to be used by a wife and her mother-in-law. The kitchen had doors leading to the dining room, the bath, and the laundry area. It had a wooden floor, roughly one-fourth of which included underfloor food storage lined with concrete. Two kamado were at one end, and a separate portable stove using charcoal was set up in the middle of the room. Next to the kamado was a stone sink without a water tap. Next to this sink were storage shelves with pots and pans on top, washed dishes in the middle, and vegetables and miso on the bottom. Next to the portable stove was a large food preparation table, with several drawers to store cooking utensils. Staples such as rice, sugar, and flour were kept in pots beneath this table. Additional shelves at the other end of the room could be accessed from both the kitchen and the dining room. Next to these shelves was another preparation table where foods were served onto individual dishes and then carried to the dining room. Kitchen windows and shoji were installed with glass panes to make the kitchen brighter, and electric lights were hung from the ceiling. This &quot;dream kitchen&quot; was spacious by today&#x27;s standards, yet it lacked most modern post-industrial conveniences, although many smaller improvements had been made.

Also around this time, many families started to use a low table called &quot;chabudai&quot;. Everyone sat around it, rather than using individual &quot;daiban&quot;. Until the 1960s, sitting on chairs and eating around a dining table was considered &quot;haikara&quot;.

==The kitchen in the Taishō period==
In the Taishō period (1912–1926), a popular movement called &quot;Taishō Democracy&quot; began. Its main focus was on universal suffrage for males, and this movement extended into other fields, serving as a modernization effort similar to the Meiji Restoration. The kitchen was affected.

Before the Taishō period, the kitchen was constructed so that most tasks could be done while sitting, crouching, or kneeling. This was due to long preparation and cooking times and helped keep the stove low to prevent the spread of fire. As gas stoves and European-style clothes became popular, kitchens were redesigned so they could be used while standing. A second innovation was that instead of placing the stove and water sink in a sunken, dirt-floored section of the kitchen, the stove was constructed on the same level as the rest of the kitchen, eliminating the need for stepping into footwear to attend it.

In 1922, Suzuki Shougyou began marketing a customizable kitchen set that came to be called the &quot;System Kitchen.&quot; Many of its parts were prefabricated, and it could be made to fit in a space anywhere from 1.8 to 2.7 metres, the length of one to one-and-one-half tatami mats. The System Kitchen had a water sink, a cutting board, two or more gas stoves (not included), and cabinets for storage. This Suzuki kitchen was expensive, costing 120 yen at a time when a first-year bank worker earned only 50 yen per month. Today the same worker earns over 240,000 yen or about 2,400 dollars in a month.

By the end of the Taishō period, it was becoming increasingly difficult to have a maid to help around the house. This means that the kitchen had to be smaller for a housewife working alone. Whereas a European Frankfurt kitchen measured 1.9m by 3.4m, or 6.46 square metres, Japanese pushed for an even smaller size, 1 tsubo or 3.3 square metres, the area of two tatami mats. Three sides of these kitchens were filled with cupboards, stoves, storage areas, and a water sink.

==The post-war kitchen==
Many Japanese houses were destroyed in World War II. Rebuilding allowed architects to freely redesign houses as well as kitchens. The influence of Edo-period lifestyles was now nearly gone. Electricity and gas were built into kitchens, and designs reflected this change. An electric refrigerator, a luxury item before the war, became a standard item in the 1950s, along with an electric washing machine and a black-and-white television. However, early post-war housing projects were often poorly designed. Sometimes architects simply copied plans for American or European housing projects, with only minor modifications to better suit Japanese families. Kitchens were small and soon became cluttered with new electric appliances.

The &quot;System Kitchen&quot; approach to design was intended to make the kitchen easier for the average housewife to use. Since most families cook many types of cuisine in their kitchens, a streamlined cooking process was studied, focusing on how the kitchen was actually used. In a system kitchen, the refrigerator and other electrical appliances were placed in predesigned locations, and storage spaces were subdivided to house pots, pans and kitchen utensils.

==Contemporary==

A typical modern Japanese kitchen includes the following:
* Counter: Countertop is usually made of cultured marble, but wood or natural stone is used for higher-end kitchens and stainless steel are used for commercial or lower-end kitchens.
* Large sink
* Cabinets
* Refrigerator and freezer: Especially in smaller kitchens for apartments, the top is usually low enough to use as an additional surface, particularly for appliances, similar to Western dormitory-sized refrigerator/freezers. In larger kitchens, full height refrigerators are common.
* Gas or induction stove: In smaller kitchens, there are only one or two burners, while more often it is three to four burners, with a narrow grill underneath for fish or vegetables. In the low-end apartments, stoves are often not built-in but rather a counter-top appliance, which is attached with a hose to a gas or power outlet. In case of earthquakes, the gas tap is to be turned off to prevent fires.
* Electric rice cooker: Over 95% of Japanese houses have one.
* Electric water boiler or kettle, particularly for making tea, but also instant ramen
* Toaster oven
* Microwave oven or convection microwave
* Extractor hood or fan

Notably absent are large ovens and dishwashers. Large gas ovens are found in some kitchens, particularly in higher-end dwellings, but in most kitchens, convection microwaves are used instead. Dishwashers can commonly be found in the kitchens of houses and condominiums, but rarely in apartments.

Portable vacuum flasks are popular for carrying home-brewed tea, particularly hot tea in the winter and cold tea in the summer, particularly cold oolong tea.

<text>Tower Hill is an area of Great Barr, Birmingham, England. It is situated on the western side of the main A34 road that links Birmingham with Walsall, and straddles the Tame Valley Canal.

The canal passes through Tower Hill in a deep cutting in 200-million-year-old sandstone, and is crossed by Freeth Bridge (now restricted to pedestrians and bikes only). There are no locks on this section, which is at the Walsall Level.

The area was chiefly developed between 1930 and 1960 for a mix of private and council housing. It has shops, a medical centre, a library (venue for the Barr and Aston Local History Society) and an ambulance station; the latter in a former branch of the Birmingham Municipal Bank. The only pub, &quot;The Towers&quot;, boasts a sign carved by William Bloye.

<text>Wylde Green is a residential area within the town of Sutton Coldfield in Birmingham, England in the West Midlands. It was historically part of Warwickshire. The area is in the Sutton Vesey ward.

==History==
In the 16th century, this area of barren common land was known as the Wyld and was sparsely populated. After the Sutton Coldfield Inclosure Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. &quot;14&quot; ), there was some development and in 1840 the growth of the population to about 60 led to the building of the first school. In the 1850s substantial Victorian mansions began to appear along the Birmingham Road. Highbridge Road and Station Road were laid out in 1858 in anticipation of the coming of the railway. The railway with its station at Wylde Green railway station opened in 1862 (now on the Birmingham to Lichfield suburban line). Urbanisation of the area proceeded rapidly thereafter. In 1923, the parish of Wylde Green was created out of that of Boldmere.

In 1974 Sutton Coldfield, of which Wylde Green is a part, became part of the City of Birmingham. A consultative ballot in 2015 led to the formation of Royal Sutton Coldfield Town Council. The role of this organisation is the same as a parish council. Wylde Green falls under its authority.

Until recently there was a 1950s disused nuclear bunker that would have played a key role in the control of the Birmingham area in the event of a nuclear attack.

==Geography==
Wylde Green is situated on the south side of Sutton Coldfield, bordering the Chester Road district of north Erdington, Birmingham and the Pype Hayes district to the southeast . To the north is Beeches Walk (an informal boundary between it and the Maney area that heralds the start of the town centre of Sutton Coldfield). To the south is the Chester Road crossroads, near to the Yenton Public House, beyond which is Erdington. To the east across New Hall Valley is Walmley, and on the west is Boldmere.

==Housing and facilities==
Much of the housing dates from the 1930s, late 1940s and 1950s. Much of the area is a middle-working class suburb, with small pockets of affluence. There is one tower block located within Wylde Green, Heron Court, which is behind The Lanes Shopping Centre, which also has flats above retail floors.

Wylde Green Road, the road to Walmley, was noted for having a ford across Plants Brook until around 1967. Within the valley are New Hall Valley Country Park and Plantsbrook Nature Reserve. Also on the Wylde Green Road is a cottage which used to look over the ford. It was called the Fordkeeper&#x27;s Cottage and was built by Bishop Vesey.

Wylde Green was previously served by Wylde Green library, a one-storey building that, until recently, was run by volunteers. It is located to the rear of The Lanes Shopping Centre which, along with the rest of the street, hosts the main shopping area for Wylde Green. Wylde Green Library has been cut, and Birmingham City Council blames lack of funding from the Central government. Opposite the library is Emmanuel Parish Church, a Grade II* listed building, designed by William Bidlake. The organ was produced in 1932 by Willis Organs. The church is home to one of the few remaining boys choirs and also has a well-established girls choir. Adjacent to the library is Wylde Green Primary School, opened in 1840. Another church in Wylde Green is the Wylde Green United Reformed Church, established in 1897.

<text>Boldmere is a suburb and residential area of Sutton Coldfield, City of Birmingham, England. It is bordered by New Oscott, Sutton Park, Wylde Green and Erdington, and is in the ward of Sutton Vesey.

== History ==

=== Toponymy ===
&quot;Boldmere&quot; is a corruption of the word &quot;Baldmoor&quot;, coming from the Middle English &quot;bald&quot; (meaning &quot;&quot;) and the Anglo-Saxon &quot;moor&quot; (meaning &quot;&quot;). Therefore, Boldmere literally means a &quot;bald moor&quot;; a treeless patch. &quot;Bald&quot; (meaning &quot;&quot;) was also a personal name used by the Anglo-Saxons.

==== Name history ====
At the time of John Speed&#x27;s 1610 atlas &quot;The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine&quot;, Boldmere was known as Cofield Wast. The area was described as &quot;an open, wild and windy expanse, covered with gorse&quot;.

The United Kingdom Census of 1841 refers to the area as Baldmoor Lake, which was once a body of water south of the Chester Road. The lake has also been known as Bowen Pool, Baldmoor, and Bolemore Lake, though no lake is shown on Speed&#x27;s map of 1610 (nor on other later maps). The census did, however, list a dwelling on the Chester Road as &quot;Lake House&quot;. There is, however, a Lakehouse Road and Baldmoor Lake Road in the area.

By 1856, the area had become known as The Coldfield, a name which lasted at least until the introduction of the railway.

=== Expansion ===
On introduction of the 1825 inclosure act, the area saw little expansion due to common land becoming privately owned. The 1841 census listed eight families in the area, including agricultural workers, a painter, an Irish carrier, and a wire drawer. It is likely that the latter worked at Penns Mill, a nearby wire mill run by the Webster family (with Baron Dickinson Webster&#x27;s business involvements including the transatlantic telegraph cable).

Boldmere did expand, however, upon the introduction of the London and North Western Railway. Two stations opened in the region at Wylde Green and Chester Road, in 1862 and 1863 respectively.

A second housing boom occurred in the 1930s, with both private and council housing being built.

=== Administration ===
In 1857, Boldmere was designated as an ecclesiastical parish, formed from the parish of St Michael&#x27;s in Sutton Coldfield. When Sutton Coldfield was reorganised in 1885 (under the Municipal Corporations Act 1882), Boldmere was created as a ward, before being divided into Boldmere West and Boldmere East in 1935.

Boldmere is now part of the Royal Sutton Coldfield Town Council, which was formed following a consultative ballot in 2015. The role of this organisation is the same as a parish council. Boldmere is in the Sutton Vesey electoral ward.

== Geography ==
Boldmere is triangular in shape and roughly bounded on the north by Sutton Park, on the east by the Cross-City railway line and on the south-west by Chester Road. Boldmere Gate provides access to Sutton Park.

The main shopping centre of Boldmere is at the northern end of Boldmere Road, which runs north-south through the centre of Boldmere. The collection of shops at the southern end of Boldmere Road is known locally as Little Boldmere.

Gibbet Hill, in the north-west of the area, is named after the gibbet from which Edward Allport was hanged for the murder of London silk dyer John Johnson in the area on 28 March 1729. Although this site is no longer referred to as Gibbet Hill, and was undeveloped until (at least) 1906, the toponymy has survived in the name of Gibbet Hill Wood; an area which Birmingham City Council have identified as &quot;an area of potential archaeological importance&quot; due to &quot;surviving archaeological remains&quot;.

=== Location in context ===
== Economy ==
Boldmere is well-served with shops, hairdressers, pubs and restaurants. There are also a post office and a public library. All banks in Boldmere have now closed with the nearest branches being in Erdington or Sutton Town Centre.

=== Industry ===

In the 18th century, Powell&#x27;s Pool (then known as New Forge Pool) near Boldmere Gate was the site of the mill used by John Wyatt to experiment with mechanised cotton spinning. Along with Lewis Paul, he developed the roller spinning machine and the flyer-and-bobbin system (Paul patented the former on 24 June 1738). In 1750, the mill was used by William Powell to manufacture spades (using locally-grown ash wood for the handles). It is believed that the first steel garden fork was manufactured at the mill. The building was later used to produce steel for the production of pen nibs. The Ordnance Survey&#x27;s First Series map (1834) identifies a forge in this area, of which John Willets (a forgeman), John Page (a spade maker), and John Harris (a saw maker) have all been identified as proprietors.

The mill was demolished some time after 1936, after lying unused and dilapidated for a number of years. Although none of the building&#x27;s structure remains, a waterfall (providing a spillway to Powell&#x27;s Pool) is now sited where the millrace was located.

== Transport ==
Boldmere&#x27;s main roads are Jockey Road (A453), Chester Road (A452) and Boldmere Road (B4142). Boldmere is served by Wylde Green and Chester Road railway stations, both on the Cross-City railway line, which runs between Lichfield Trent Valley and Redditch (via Birmingham New Street).

Boldmere is served by a number of National Express West Midlands bus services, including routes 5, 66, 77 and 907.

== Places of worship ==
The churches in the area are St Michael&#x27;s (Church of England), St Nicholas&#x27;s (Roman Catholic), Chester Road Baptist Church, Boldmere Methodist Church, and Wylde Green United Reformed Church. St Nicholas&#x27;s Church was preceded by a chapel that was designed by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin and which opened in 1841. These churches take their name from Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman.

The ring of bells at St Michael&#x27;s church are noted as being one of the few rings in Birmingham still in existence that were produced before the introduction of scientific bell tuning in the 1890s (John Taylor &amp; Co installed Birmingham&#x27;s first harmonic ring at St. Barnabas&#x27; Church, Erdington in 1906). The bells&#x27; 18th–19th century tonal quality is rare as most pre-scientific bells in Birmingham have been recast by the Taylor or Whitechapel foundries.

In 1964, St Michael&#x27;s church was partially destroyed by fire, with only the tower and south aisle surviving. The building&#x27;s reconstruction was not without controversy, particularly due to the unconventional use of Staffordshire blue brick.

== Education ==
Educational facilities in the area include Boldmere Infant and Nursery School, Boldmere Junior School, St Nicholas Catholic Primary School, and Boldmere Adult Education Centre.

In 1848, Reverend W. K. Riland Bedford worked towards opening Boldmere National School for Girls and Infants. The building served as Boldmere&#x27;s Anglican church until the opening of St Michael&#x27;s in 1857, and is now a health clinic.

<text>Mere Green is a small commercial centre in Four Oaks, Sutton Coldfield, England.

==Facilities==
Mere Green includes a mixture of independent shops, bars and restaurants and some national chain stores located around the junction of Lichfield Road, Belwell Lane, Hill Village Road and Mere Green Road.

Supermarkets include Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Lidl and Aldi. There are several pubs in the area including the Mare Pool (Wetherspoons), Renato Lounge, Old School House (now closed) and the Fox and Dogs. Mere Green was also home to Flints which was a bar that was very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. It underwent various changes in ownership and name before resorting back to its original name in 2018. By 2022 it had ceased trading and in 2024 (along with the adjacent former Waitrose building) it was demolished to make way for the construction of an Aldi store. Aldi opened in October 2024.
Mere Green Library and Community Centre offers classes in such subjects as yoga and art, free internet access and facilities for tennis and lawn green bowls as well as hosting reading groups for adults and children and occasional exhibitions.

The area made the news in 1983 when Italian Renato Pagliari, then co-owner of the La Gondola restaurant in Mere Green, scored a No 1 hit single in the UK as one half of the singing duo &#x27;Renée and Renato&#x27; with the song &#x27;Save Your Love&#x27;. The restaurant no longer exists.

==Redevelopment==
Plans were outlined for a major redevelopment of the Mere Green shopping area, which would involve the demolition of many of the smaller shops. The scheme, led by Spring Urban, was approved in August 2007. The development was however delayed by the recession and again when Spring Urban&#x27;s parent company, Castlemore Securities, went into administration in February 2009.

Work finally began on the £15 million &quot;Mulberry Walk&quot; scheme in September 2015.

The first new store on the development that opened was Boots, which opened on 17 August 2016. Warrens Bakery moved in in February 2017, making the development home to their first store outside the West Country. This store closed in 2019.

==Public Transport==
Bus is the main public transport to and from Mere Green. Most services are operated by National Express West Midlands (NXWM) with service 78 operated by Diamond Bus and service 604 operated by Claribel Coaches. Service 604 will be operated by National Express from 25th April 2022. Until 2019, Midland Classic operated service X12 between Sutton Coldfield and Burton-upon-Trent which partly replaced the former Stevensons (later Arriva Midlands) service 112.
Routes include:
*6 Walsall - Sutton Coldfield
*78 Queslett - Sutton Coldfield. Part replaced by 78 (see below). 
*604 Kingstanding - Mere Green This service has now been replaced by service 78A operating between Kingstanding and Sutton Coldfield, also replacing part of the 78.
*X3 Birmingham - Hill Hook. This service was extended to serve Lichfield in 2019 partially replacing Midland Classic service X12. 
*X5 Birmingham - Roughley

Mere Green centre is approximately 2/3 of a mile from Four Oaks railway station on the Cross-City Line which provides a frequent rail service to Redditch and Bromsgrove via Birmingham New Street and to Lichfield.

<doc id="844530" wikidata="Q31022" url="?curid=844530" title="Professional ethics">
<text>Professional ethics encompass the personal and corporate standards of behavior expected of professionals.

The word professionalism originally applied to vows of a religious order. By no later than the year 1675, the term had seen secular application and was applied to the three learned professions: divinity, law, and medicine. The term professionalism was also used for the military profession around this same time.

Professionals and those working in acknowledged professions exercise specialist knowledge and skill. How the use of this knowledge should be governed when providing a service to the public can be considered a moral issue and is termed &quot;professional ethics&quot;.

One of the earliest examples of professional ethics is the Hippocratic oath to which medical doctors still adhere to this day.

==Components==
Some professional organizations may define their ethical approach in terms of a number of discrete components. Typically these include honesty, trustworthiness, transparency, accountability, confidentiality, objectivity, respect, obedience to the law, and loyalty.

==Implementation==
Most professionals have internally enforced codes of practice that members of the profession must follow to prevent exploitation of the client and to preserve the integrity and reputation of the profession. This is not only for the benefit of the client but also for the benefit of those belonging to that profession. Disciplinary codes allow the profession to define a standard of conduct and ensure that individual practitioners meet this standard, by disciplining them from the professional body if they do not practice accordingly. This allows those professionals who act with a conscience to practice in the knowledge that they will not be undermined commercially by those who have fewer ethical qualms. It also maintains the public’s trust in the profession, encouraging the public to continue seeking their services.

===Internal regulation===
In cases where professional bodies regulate their own ethics, there are possibilities for such bodies to become self-serving and fail to follow their own ethical code when dealing with renegade members. This is particularly true of professions in which they have almost a complete monopoly on a particular area of knowledge. For example, until recently, the English courts deferred to the professional consensus on matters relating to their practice that lay outside case law and legislation.

New UK research shows that lawyers “are sometimes too inclined to engage in professionally questionable, and potentially even illegal, actions without fully reflecting on the legal rules and interests engaged”. It found the potential for the rule of law to be challenged by certain forms of lawyer conduct was “widespread and significant”. Recent events (2023) in the USA seem to reflect similar issues.

==Statutory regulation==
In many countries there is some statutory regulation of professional ethical standards such as the statutory bodies that regulate nursing and midwifery in England and Wales. Failure to comply with these standards can thus become a matter for the courts.

==Examples==
For example, a lay member of the public should not be held responsible for failing to act to save a car crash victim because they could not give an appropriate emergency treatment, though, they are responsible for attempting to get help for the victim. This is because they do not have the relevant knowledge and experience. In contrast, a fully trained doctor (with the correct equipment) would be capable of making the correct diagnosis and carrying out appropriate procedures. Failure of a doctor to help at all in such a situation would generally be regarded as negligent and unethical. Though, if a doctor helps and makes a mistake that is considered negligent and unethical, there could be egregious repercussions. An untrained person would only be considered to be negligent for failing to act if they did nothing at all to help and is protected by the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; laws if they unintentionally caused more damage and possible loss of life.

A business may approach a professional engineer to certify the safety of a project which is not safe. While one engineer may refuse to certify the project on moral grounds, the business may find a less scrupulous engineer who will be prepared to certify the project for a bribe, thus saving the business the expense of redesigning.

Some corporations have tried to burnish their ethical image by creating whistle-blower protections, such as anonymity. In the case of Citi, they call this the &quot;Ethics Hotline&quot;, though it is unclear whether firms such as Citi take offences reported to these hotlines seriously or not.

===Separatism===
On a theoretical level, there is debate as to whether an ethical code for a profession should be consistent with the requirements of morality governing the public. Separatists argue that professions should be allowed to go beyond such confines when they judge it necessary. This is because they are trained to produce certain outcomes which may take moral precedence over other functions of society. For example, it could be argued that a doctor may lie to a patient about the severity of his or her condition if there is reason to believe that telling the patient would cause so much distress that it would be detrimental to his or her health. This would be a disrespect of the patient&#x27;s autonomy, as it denies the patient information that could have a great impact on his or her life. This would generally be seen as morally wrong.

However, if the end of improving and maintaining health is given a moral priority in society, then it may be justifiable to contravene other moral demands in order to meet this goal. Separatism is based on a relativist conception of morality that there can be different, equally valid, moral codes that apply to different sections of society and differences in codes between societies. If moral universalism is ascribed to, then this would be inconsistent with the view that professions can have a different moral code, as the universalist holds that there is only one valid moral code for all.

==Student ethics==
As attending college after high school graduation becomes a standard in the lives of young people, colleges and universities are becoming more business-like in their expectations of the students. Although people have differing opinions about if it is effective, surveys state that it is the overall goal of the university administrators. Setting up a business-like atmosphere helps students get adjusted from a more relaxed nature, like high school, towards what will be expected of them in the business world upon graduating from college.

===Codes of conduct===
Codes of conduct are becoming more of a staple in the academic lives of students. While some of these rules are based solely on academics others are more in depth than in previous years, such as, detailing the level of respect expected towards staff and gambling. Not only do codes of conduct apply while attending the schools at home, but also while studying abroad. Schools also implement a code of conduct for international study abroad programs which carry over many of the same rules found in most student handbooks.

<text>Four Oaks is an affluent residential area in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, lying along the north and east borders of Sutton Park. Four Oaks is situated approximately north of Birmingham City Centre, and is bordered by Sutton Park, Streetly, Mere Green, Little Aston, Roughley and Aldridge. Four Oaks has a population of 21,690 as of 2004, and is part of the Sutton Four Oaks electoral ward.

==Four Oaks Estate==
In 1677, Henry Folliott, 3rd Baron Folliott of Ballyshannon bought of woodland and built Four Oaks Hall. Folliott died in 1716, but his widow continued to live in Four Oaks Hall until her death in 1751. The estate was sold to Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton, who remodelled and modernised the house. In 1757, he bought a further of woodland to annex his estate and form a deer park. He sold the estate to Thomas Gresley in 1778, who sold the estate to Sir Hugh Bateman, 1st Baronet of Hartington Hall in 1785, who in turn sold the estate to Sir Edmund Cradock-Hartopp, 1st Baronet in 1792. In 1827, Hartopp bought of woodland to further increase the size of the deer park. The estate was sold to Hubert de Burgh-Canning, 2nd Marquess of Clanricarde for residential development in 1868. Roads were named to commemorate the history of the estate, and between 1895 and 1915 approximately 200 houses were built on the estate, forming Four Oaks Estate. The neglected and dilapidated Four Oaks Hall was demolished in 1898, and the site is now occupied by Carhampton House.

Four Oaks Estate is a mainly residential area with the Four Oaks Tennis Club at its heart, approximately enclosed by Lichfield Road, Four Oaks Road, Sutton Park and Sutton Park Line railway line. One of the most expensive residential areas in the West Midlands, the Park&#x27;s roads are home to some of the region&#x27;s wealthiest residents. Four Oaks Park is characterised by its large houses and tree-lined, speed-humped roads. The houses on the Estate are individually designed by prominent architects such as Charles Bateman, and most sell for at least £2 million. Many of the houses have received listed building status. Four Oaks Estate is also home to Four Oaks Tennis Club, which was founded in 1906.

The roads on Four Oaks Estate are managed by Four Oaks Estate Ltd and run by a formally constituted Board of Directors, who are all Estate residents, supported by an appointed Secretary &amp; Treasurer.

Four Oaks Estate Ltd submitted in 2019 a Lawful Development Certificate application 2019/03339/PA to Birmingham Council, that was Refused on the grounds that the Estate roads were Highways maintained at private expense, meaning the public enjoy the benefit of a public right of way over the Estate roads for any and all purposes and at all times, the same as any other publicly maintained highway. The plan was to create a large exclusive gated community consisting of 340 houses, by installing 8 sets of perimeter gates on the 8 entrance points into the private residential estate. However it is unlawful to obstruct a highway and also unlawful to obstruct a public right of way, which gates would do.

A similar planning application at the neighbouring Little Aston Park similar exclusive private residential estate 1 mile away was recently Refused at a Lichfield Council Planning Committee meeting, and subsequent Planning Inspectorate Appeal Dismissed, as to create a large exclusive gated community would undermine social cohesion by creating social segregation. However a subsequent application for Certificates of Lawfulness were subsequently approved by Lichfield Council for 6 sets of perimeter gates, despite Little Aston Park Estate having a public church, golf club, public post box within its grounds, and their Estate roads having an unknown legal owner, meaning the legal owner could not have installed legal signs to prevent dedication of the roads as highways. This raises the question of the legal validity of Little Aston Park&#x27;s signs installed by residents, and therefore raises the possibility their roads are also highways maintained at private expense and also a public right of way.

<text>Hill Hook is an area of Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, England.

The area includes Hill Hook Local Nature Reserve, declared in 2003 with an area of 5.65 hectares, which is on the site of a watermill built in the 17th century. An earlier dam showed the extent of the original mill pool, which was enlarged in 1767. The nature reserve, known locally as &#x27;The Meddies&#x27; or &#x27;The Mill Pond&#x27; was substantially built upon from the early 1980s onwards, although small parts remain untouched. The Friends of Hill Hook, a local group of The Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country work alongside the Council ranger Service to care for the site.

It is close to Four Oaks and Little Aston and is approximately one mile from Sutton Park. The area is served by Blake Street railway station, and is served by National Express West Midlands route X3. Midland Classic of Burton previously operated an hourly X12 service between Burton and Sutton Coldfield, however this was cut to terminate at Lichfield and subsequently the X3 extended to Lichfield half hourly to cover this gap. Prior to the X12, for many years Stevensons of Uttoxeter operated service 112 which ran between Birmingham, via Erdington, Sutton Coldfield &amp; Lichfield, and Burton-upon-Trent and which also served Blake Street railway station.

<text>The Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, commonly known as CAFOD, is an international development and relief charity. It is the official aid agency of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. 

CAFOD is part of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of Caritas Europa, as well as a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC). Its work is based on Gospel values and Catholic social teaching.

The Caritas Social Action Network is the agency&#x27;s counterpart for the domestic work of the Church in England and Wales.

== History ==
CAFOD&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the launch of a &quot;Family Fast Day&quot; organised by a group of Catholic women in 1960, who used the money saved through fasting to support a project in Dominica. The Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales registered the charity in 1962. Its current governing document dates from 2015.

In 2015, CAFOD joined the CHS Alliance. One year later, it was certified against the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability with the current certification being valid until 2027.

CAFOD&#x27;s Director Christine Allen was appointed in March 2019. 

In 2020, CAFOD launched a new strategy, &quot;Our Common Home&quot;, based on Pope Francis&#x27; encyclical Laudato Si&#x27;, which calls for a new definition of progress rooted in integral ecology, recognising that everything is connected and hearing both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor, calling on all people to dialogue in society about how best to tackle the global issue.

== Work ==

The stated aim of CAFOD is to tackle poverty globally. Through local Catholic Church and secular partners, its aims to help people directly in their own communities and campaigns for global justice

=== International programmes ===

In 2023, CAFOD implemented programmes in 42 countries located in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America &amp; Caribbean. CAFOD is not a direct implementer but works according to the localisation principle, i.e. through local partner organisations. That same year, CAFOD supported local partners organisations with 594 grants and programme payments worth £41.8 million, reaching one million vulnerable and excluded people directly.

=== Campaigns ===

CAFOD has had many campaigns over the years and participated in joint campaigns with other charities. These campaigns tackled a series of topics, for example the impact of debt crises in the poorest nations (&quot;Jubilee 2000&quot;, &quot;Cancel the Debt&quot;, &quot;Stop Cowboy Lenders&quot;, &quot;The New Debt Crisis&quot;), or the right of small-scale farmer around the world to use their seeds and the negative impact of powerful agribusiness companies (&quot;Fix the Food System&quot;). Other campaigns demanded climate action (&quot;The Time is Now&quot;; &quot;One Climate, One World&quot;), renewable energy for the world&#x27;s poorest people (&quot;Power to Be&quot;), or raised awareness against the UK Illegal Migration Act 2023 (&quot;Build Bridges not Walls&quot;).

CAFOD supports and administers the process whereby Catholic communities (churches, schools, religious orders and chaplaincies) can apply for the &quot;Livesimply&quot; award, through which communities can record, celebrate and develop their approach to living simply, in solidarity with people in poverty and sustainably with creation. Participation in CAFOD&#x27;s &quot;LiveSimply&quot; programme has been commended by the Catholic Bishops of England and Wales.

== Structure and funding ==

In 2023, CAFOD employed 391 staff and in addition worked with more than 3,000 volunteers carrying out a range of roles such as campaigning, fundraising, media, office support and youth work. 

CAFOD is funded by the Catholic community in England and Wales, the British government (through UK aid), private and institutional donors, and the general public.

In 2019/20 CAFOD&#x27;s income was £45million. A few years later, in 2022/2023, the total revenue had increased to , £37 million of which were raised by 1,856 parishes in England and over 78,000 individuals, 1,043 schools and over 1,000 organisations. In addition, the organisation received over £11 million from legacies, raised around £5.5 million to respond to humanitarian emergencies in East Africa, Ukraine, Pakistan, Turkey and Syria, and obtained £16 million from the Disasters Emergency Committee.

In order to raise awareness and funds, CAFOD has been working with &quot;celebraty embassadors&quot;, including TV presenter Julie Etchingham, actor David Harewood, actress Jo Joyner, TV and radio presenter Dermot O&#x27;Leary, actor and director Ben Price, actress Emma Rigby, cook and television presenter Delia Smith, and composer Benson Taylor. 

CAFOD&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Side by Side&quot;, is published quarterly.

<text>Bartley Green is a residential suburban area and electoral ward in Birmingham, England, south west of the city centre. The ward is part of the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency and is represented in parliament by Labour Co-operative MP Preet Gill.
== History ==

Bartley Green was first noted in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Berchelai&quot;. This means either the birch tree wood or the clearing in the birch trees (from the Old English &quot;beorc leah&quot;). Bartley Green was part of the estate of the manor of Weoley. Bartley Green was again mentioned in 1657, however, this time it was under its current name. Most of the land occupied by Bartley Reservoir was in the parish of Northfield, Birmingham, originally in Worcestershire. It was transferred to Warwickshire when Northfield became part of Birmingham in November 1911.

Bartley Green became more built up after the end of the Second World War in 1945, with a mix of private and council housing being built.

The Athol Farm council estate was a notable development by the city council during the 1960s, and included five tower blocks; however all of these have now been demolished.

However, the south-west end of the reservoir overlapped into the parish of Frankley, in Worcestershire (Hereford and Worcester, from 1974). In April 1995, part of Frankley (including the south-west part of Bartley Reservoir) was transferred to Birmingham and became part of the West Midlands county.

The parish church is St. Michael and All Angels.

==Geography==
Located to the east is the Weoley ward, to the south is Frankley and to the west is the county of Worcestershire as well as Halesowen and Illey, part of Dudley MBC. To the north is Quinton and Woodgate Valley Country Park.
Bartley Reservoir, a reservoir for drinking water, is used by Bartley Sailing Club and nearby schools and clubs for sailing and canoeing.

== Politics ==
Bartley Green has been part of the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency since 1997, having previously been in the neighbouring Birmingham Northfield Constituency. Since its inclusion, the Labour Party have held the seat in every general election, which is currently represented by Labour MP Preet Gill since June 2017, and previously by Gisela Stuart who held the seat since 1997, replacing Conservative Dame Jill Knight in the year of Tony Blair&#x27;s landslide victory. Edgbaston has had a female Member of Parliament since 1953, longer than any other UK constituency.

Bartley Green has been a safe Conservative ward at Birmingham City Council level in recent years, with all three serving Councillors – John Lines, Vivienne Barton and Bruce Lines (son of John) – representing the party. Labour candidates had won the ward on several occasions in the 1980s and early 1990s but never held all three seats at once. The most recent election in which it was won by Labour was in 1995.

Councillor John Lines was Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 2012/13.

The ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer, with the current holder of the status being Tina Willetts.

== Schools and education ==
Bartley Green National School opened in 1840 as a Sunday school. The site was subsequently enlarged and the school rebuilt in 1871. By 1872, there were two departments for mixed and infant children. A new infants school opened in 1881 on a site to the north of the church. The school was reorganised in 1931 into a single department for junior mixed and infant children aged 5 – 9½ years. Children aged 9½ and over were transferred to Bartley Green Council School. In 1951, the school was again reorganised for infant children only. It closed in 1954 on the opening of St. Michael&#x27;s C.E. Primary School. The last headteacher of the primary school, Lily C. Treadwell, was transferred to St. Michael&#x27;s C.E. Primary School to become its first headteacher.

Bartley Green Council School opened in 1914 replacing Woodgate Council School. It was reorganised in 1931 for Senior Mixed and again in 1951 for Junior Mixed. The school closed in 1953 when the pupils transferred to Woodgate County Primary School.

=== Primary schools ===
There are eight primary schools located within the Bartley Green ward. As part of the Bartley Green Action Plan, all primary schools were given golf facilities. Woodgate Junior and Infant School, Kitwell Junior and Infant School, St. Michael&#x27;s C.E. Junior and Infant School and St. Peter&#x27;s R.C. School all had golf courses constructed within their school grounds for the pupils.

=== Secondary schools ===
Bartley Green School was granted technology status in 2000 and has 848 pupils on roll. 61% of pupils are boys and 12.3% of pupils come from ethnic minorities. Half of these pupils from ethnic minorities are from the Black Caribbean ethnic group.

A survey conducted by the Department of Applied Social Studies and Social Research in 1998, concluded that &quot;52.4% of pupils at Bartley Green School live in 40% of the Birmingham Enumeration Districts with the highest proportion of the population dependent on income support. Around half of the pupils at the school live in the Bartley Green ward, and 22.9% live in the Weoley and Longbridge wards. All of these wards have urban deprivation scores considerably above the Birmingham average, which itself is far higher than the national average.&quot;

Hillcrest School was opened as Bartley Green Grammar School for Girls on 7 September 1954. The sixth form was set up around the end of the 1950s. The school was renamed Hillcrest School in September 1983 and dropped its grammar school status. During an uncertain period, it faced closure during the 1980s. However, it remained open following a campaign by the school and has since become one of the most successful schools in Birmingham. Boys were allowed to join the sixth form during the 1980s.

King Edward VI Five Ways moved to the area from Five Ways in 1958, however, retained the name. Having introduced girls in the years following 1998, today Five Ways is the largest co-educational state grammar school in the West Midlands and one of the top five co-educational grammar schools nationally.

<text>Erotic electrostimulation (abbreviated erotic e-stim and also known as electrosex) is a sexual practice involving the application of electrical stimulation to the nerves of the body, with particular emphasis on the genitals, using a power source (such as a TENS, EMS, violet wands, or made-for-play units) for purposes of sexual stimulation. Electrostimulation has been associated with BDSM activities, and erotic electrostimulation is an evolution of that practice.

== Safety ==
Electrostimulation, in general, can cause tissue damage or even death if misused. The most common problems arising from electrostimulation tend to be burns from lack of sufficiently wide surface contact, i.e. bad contact, between the electrode and the skin&#x27;s surface. Even at relatively low current and voltage, there is also risk of interference with normal heart function (potentially including cardiac arrest), and this risk is higher for those who use an artificial pacemaker or similar device or who have heart conditions.

A few cases of accidental death as a result of autoerotic electrostimulation have been reported in the forensic science literature; the cases reported involved mains-powered, self-made devices, with current passing through the chest intentionally (usually via nipple stimulation) or unintentionally (for instance, touching an energized part with a hand). In one case reported in the press, a man from York, Pennsylvania was sentenced to 20–40 years in prison for third-degree murder and reckless endangerment after killing his wife with electrostimulation to her nipples directly from a power strip plugged into the mains.

== History ==

The use of electricity for entertainment purposes dates back at least as early as the 1740s. In the 1830s, insertable electrode attachments for small magnetos could be purchased. Later in the 1800s, various electric belts (some complete with &quot;suspensory sack&quot;) were advertised as cures for impotence. In the 1920s, the American Medical Association investigated such devices, and concluded that they provided &quot;more or less mechanical masturbation&quot;.

Modern electrostimulation first became recognized during the 1950s with the introduction of a device called the &quot;Relax-A-Cizor&quot;, which was originally designed to stimulate the muscles of a relaxing subject using electric currents as a means of &quot;passive exercise&quot;. Such power sources are still in medical use today and are known as EMS (electrical muscle stimulation) units. Some people soon found alternative uses for the Relax-A-Cizors by placing the contacts on sexual parts of the body.

By the 1970s, medical TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) units were also being used for electrostimulation. In the 1980s the first devices manufactured specifically for erotic electrostimulation became available, in particular the Titillator and the Pleasure Box, later known as the PES Power Box.

In the 1970s, experimenters noticed that bare speaker wires could deliver a jolt and began using recorded and live sound for electrostimulation. At that time, there were no professionally made attachments for such play, so people built their own out of copper plumbing parts and other metal pieces with attention to resistors placed in series with the human parts to control the current for safety. Although early e-stim units used only a simple, pulsed, sinusoidal wave, newer units use more complex wave forms and also allow for the use of ambient sound or prerecorded wave forms like music or specially designed computer files for specific types of stimulation. There are now sites dedicated to the creation of MP3 files specifically for erotic journeys or symphonies, which can include such routines as rewards, punishments, very strong, and pleasantly soft portions.

== Types of power sources ==

=== Medical power sources ===

There are repackaged TENS and EMS units marketed as erotic electrostimulation power sources. EMS units are designed to cause muscle contraction.

=== Body toning and massage units ===
An increasing number of &quot;body toner&quot; or &quot;electromassage&quot;-type power sources are being marketed directly to consumers. Though lacking in options compared to the more expensive specialized units, these have proven to be an inexpensive method for entry level practice.

=== Homemade power sources ===
Some people craft &quot;homemade&quot; electrostimulation power sources, or adapt or modify commercial products (such as a Hifi or DVD system) that were never intended for electrostimulation of the human body. These can be dangerous practices; such improvised devices not specifically designed for use on the human body can easily cause injury. The risk is mostly twofold. First the device can supply too much power. Second the insulation of most devices is not suited for medical equipment. For example, a transient over-voltage on the mains input can damage the isolation of the transformer, resulting in the output terminals becoming live.

=== Erotic electrostimulation power sources ===
Erotic electrostimulation power sources are specifically designed and manufactured for erotic use on the human body. The first analog devices became popular during the mid-1980s, and during the late 1990s digital devices also became available. Both types usually allow for adjustments of frequency and power output levels, some with complex preset &quot;programs&quot; and computer controls. The setups usually consist of a &quot;box&quot; and electrodes connected by wiring. Many of the boxes are portable and can be powered by batteries or come with built-in rechargeable batteries. Some units can be connected to remote operators via an Internet-connected computer or controlled via radio frequency key fobs.

=== Other methods ===
There are other medical methods that have led to patent filings, such as the discovery that placing electrodes in the spinal cord can induce pleasurable feelings leading to orgasm. There are also various apparatuses, with external or internal stimulation.

* U.S. patent 3,941,136: &quot;Method for artificially inducing urination, defecation, or sexual excitation&quot;.
* U.S. patent 4,585,005: &quot;Method and pacemaker for stimulating penile erection&quot;.

Other kinds of apparatus use interferential currents with four surface electrodes to replace the internal electrodes.

==Electrodes==
An electrode is used to deliver the actual electrostimulation to the body.
For erotic electrostimulation, these are typically items designed to be applied to the genitals such as vaginal plugs and shields, butt plugs, probes to directly stimulate the prostate, testicle rings, CBT boards, cock rings, urethral probes, and other items for penile application. The pads used with TENS units are also used in the sexual application of electrostimulation. There are also electrified nipple and breast electrodes available. The aforementioned electrodes stimulate the nerves between and underneath the area that they are placed. This can result in a pleasurable sensation and in both the female and male, resulting in orgasm.

The electrodes can be made of metals such as gold, silver, aluminum, and stainless steel. There are also electrodes made out of conductive silicone. Conductive rubber is a cheap, flexible and efficient option.

==Violet wands==

Violet wands were originally electric and neon testers, but are now split into two types: mechanical (Tesla Coil), and solid-state wands. They are used for the application of low current, high voltage (min 35 kV to max 65 kV typically), high-frequency electricity to the body, as such they are most commonly used in BDSM for erotic sensation play. Violet wands can deliver a variety of sharp, cutting, or piercing type sensations.

A violet wand typically consists of a hand-held &quot;wand&quot; made of plastic case which encases the mechanical (Tesla coil) or solid state components; a power cable, a collet (7/16&quot; in the United States, 11 mm in Europe), and a cone. The collet is inside the cone end of the violet wand and is where glass and metal probes are inserted to be used with the wand. The cone is there to prevent sparks jumping from the collet directly to subject.

<doc id="844547" wikidata="Q7342848" url="?curid=844547" title="Robert Chambers (criminal)">
<text>Robert Emmet Chambers Jr. (born September 25, 1966) is an American criminal. Dubbed the Preppy Killer and the Central Park Strangler, Chambers gained notoriety for the August 26, 1986, strangulation death of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin in New York City&#x27;s Central Park, for which he was originally charged with second degree murder. Chambers changed his story several times during the course of the ensuing investigation, ultimately claiming that Levin&#x27;s death was the accidental result of him pushing her off of him as she purportedly sexually assaulted him, an account that was characterized by media accounts as one of &quot;rough sex&quot;. Chambers later pleaded guilty to manslaughter after a jury failed to reach a verdict after nine days of deliberation.

==Early life==
Robert Emmett Chambers was born on September 25, 1966, the only child of Phyllis Chambers, an Irish-born nurse, and Robert Chambers Sr., who worked for MCA Records and later in videocassette distribution. The family inititally lived in the working-class neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens, and later moved to Manhattan. Chambers grew up attending fancy prep schools in New York City&#x27;s wealthy Upper East Side. Though not affluent, Chambers&#x27; mother worked to pay for his childhood attendance at the prestigious York Preparatory School on the Upper East Side, though scholarships assisted in this. The fact that his family had far less money than his classmates created social problems for Chambers, including difficulty socializing with his peers. By the time he reached college age, Chambers had descended into a life of petty theft, alcoholism, and drug use.

Chambers was accepted by Boston University, but was asked to leave after one semester for reasons which included the use of a stolen credit card. He later committed other petty thefts and burglaries in connection with his drug and alcohol abuse. Unable to hold a job, Chambers was issued a summons for disorderly conduct one night after leaving Dorrian&#x27;s Red Hand, a bar located at 300 East 84th Street in Manhattan. He destroyed the summons as the police were leaving the scene, yelling, &quot;You fucking cowards, you should stick to niggers!&quot;

== Killing of Jennifer Levin ==
=== Background ===
Chambers’ girlfriend at the time of the murder was future television actress Alex Kapp. The couple broke up after Chambers stole Kapp&#x27;s $50 allowance and according to Kapp, after Levin had started to pursue him, Levin and Chambers briefly dated. On the day of the murder, both were at Dorrian&#x27;s Red Hand.

=== Finding of the body ===
A bicyclist found Levin&#x27;s half-naked corpse on August 26, 1986, at about 6:15 a.m., in Central Park near Fifth Avenue and 83rd Street, behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Her body was lying twisted by a tree, with her bra and top pulled up. Levin&#x27;s body and face were covered in scratches and bite marks. Deep red marks were across her neck, her left eye was swollen, and her fingernails were bruised, suggesting that in her final moments she had tried to pull down whatever had been strangling her.

Chambers hid and watched as police officers surveyed the scene. Investigators found Levin&#x27;s underwear some away.

Levin&#x27;s autopsy was performed by associate medical examiner Dr. Maria Luz Alandy, who determined that Levin had been strangled. Levin was estimated to have died around 5:30 a.m.

===Arrest and trial===
After several of Dorrian&#x27;s patrons told police that they had last seen Levin leaving the bar with Chambers, police went to his home. Upon arrival, they saw that Chambers had fresh and bloody scratches on both sides of his face, which he blamed on his cat before later admitting his cat was declawed. Chambers agreed to accompany police to the Central Park precinct for questioning. There he was asked if he left Dorrian&#x27;s with Levin, which he denied. After police told him that bar patrons had witnessed him leaving with Levin, he admitted that he had.

He said that she quickly went to buy cigarettes. Detectives pointed out that Levin did not smoke and Chambers admitted that she had not gone for cigarettes. He then claimed that she cajoled him into going to Central Park to have sex and she died during an aggressive sexual encounter in the park. Before booking, Chambers was permitted to see his father, to whom he said, &quot;That fucking bitch, why didn&#x27;t she leave me alone?&quot;

Archbishop Theodore Edgar McCarrick of Newark, New Jersey, later Archbishop of Washington, wrote a letter of support for Chambers&#x27; bail application. He had known Chambers and his mother because she had been employed as a nurse by Cardinal Terence Cooke. McCarrick was close to the Chambers family and had served as Robert&#x27;s godfather at his baptism. In 2019, he was defrocked for sex offenses against adults and minors. Chambers had secured bail through his family and the owner of the bar, Jack Dorrian, who put up his townhouse as collateral for a bail bond.

Chambers was charged with, and tried for, two counts of second-degree murder. His defense was that Levin&#x27;s death had occurred during &quot;rough sex&quot;. He was defended by Jack Litman, who had previously used the temporary insanity defense on behalf of Richard Herrin for the murder of Yale University student Bonnie Garland. Litman claimed Levin was promiscuous, saying she had a sex diary and that her sexual history was admissible as evidence, prompting headlines such as &quot;How Jennifer Courted Death&quot; in New York&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot;. On remand, Chambers was filmed twisting off the head of a Barbie doll and saying, &quot;Oops, I think I killed her.&quot;

Prosecutor Linda Fairstein stated: &quot;In more than 8,000 cases of reported assaults in the last ten years, this is the first in which a male reported being sexually assaulted by a female.&quot;

Chambers&#x27; trial began on January 4, 1988, and lasted 13 weeks. Alandy testified on February 9 that pinpoint hemorrhages observed in the soft tissue around Levin&#x27;s eyes could be caused by a constriction of the blood vessels in the neck. She explained that this was evidence of compression of her neck, and an indication that she had been strangled. When Chambers&#x27; attorney, Jack Litman, suggested on cross-examination that Chambers could have choked Levin in an arm lock that could cause death in seconds, and that the marks on her neck could have been made when she quickly moved her head from side to side in a struggle for air, Alandy stated that while such an occurrence was possible, this did not occur in Levin&#x27;s case. She also stated that while some of the injuries on Levin&#x27;s neck could have been caused by Chambers&#x27; wristwatch and shirt, rather than his hands, her injuries overall were not consistent with the scenario Litman described.

When the jury failed to reach a verdict after nine days of deliberation, the prosecution and Chambers agreed to a plea bargain. He pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter, which carried a sentence of between five and fifteen years. He was also required to admit that he intended to hurt Levin sufficiently to cause her death. During his sentencing that April, he stated in court, &quot;It breaks my heart to have to say that. The Levin family has gone through hell because of my actions, and I am sorry.&quot; Chambers received a sentence of 15 years in prison.

== Post-conviction==
In 1997, Chambers sent an untitled essay he wrote to prison anthologist Jeff Evans. The piece, subsequently titled &quot;Christmas: Present&quot;, appeared in the book &quot;Undoing Time: American Prisoners in Their Own Words&quot;. Written while Chambers was incarcerated at Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, New York, the essay is an entry from one of his journals, which he calls &quot;a record of the meaningless hope and frightening losses of a person I don&#x27;t even know.&quot;

Chambers was released from Auburn Prison on February 14, 2003, after having served the entirety of his prison term due to his numerous infractions. His release was a media circus, with reporters staking out prime sections of the sidewalk opposite the prison as early as thirteen hours before his 7:30 a.m. release time. The same day, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; interviewed Chambers, who continued to claim that he strangled Levin accidentally in an attempt to stop her from hurting him during rough sex. He also falsely denied that he had been disciplined in prison.

Jack Dorrian settled with Levin&#x27;s parents on their claim that Dorrian&#x27;s bar, where Levin and Chambers had been before they went to Central Park on the night of her death, had served too much alcohol to Chambers. A wrongful death lawsuit, which Chambers did not contest, provides that he must pay all lump sums he receives, including any income from book or movie deals, plus ten percent of his future income (up to $25 million), to the Levin family. The family has said all the money it gets from Chambers will go to victims&#x27; rights organizations.

==Drug charges==
In July 2005, Chambers pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge and on August 29 was given a reduced sentence of 90 days in jail and fined $200 for a license violation. The judge added 10 days to the time prosecutors and Chambers&#x27; lawyer had agreed on because he was an hour late for the hearing. He would have faced up to a year in jail if he had been convicted after trial.

On October 22, 2007, Chambers was arrested again, this time in his own apartment, and charged with three counts of selling a controlled substance in the first degree, three counts of selling a controlled substance in the second degree, and one count of resisting arrest. His longtime girlfriend, Shawn Kovell, was also arrested on one count of selling a controlled substance in the second degree. The &quot;Daily News&quot; reported:

Cops said Chambers, 41, struggled with officers who tried to handcuff him on the felony charges. One detective suffered a broken thumb in the fracas.

Commenting on his new arrest, former Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein, who had prosecuted Chambers for Levin&#x27;s death, said:

Doesn&#x27;t surprise me. I always believed his problem with drugs and alcohol would get him in trouble again. He&#x27;s had the opportunity in prison to detox and take college courses, to straighten out his life, but that clearly is of no interest to him. He&#x27;s learned nothing in the last 20 years.

Chambers and Kovell were charged with running a cocaine operation out of the apartment. The two had previously been given notices for not paying rent, and the phone had been disconnected.

On August 11, 2008, the Manhattan DA&#x27;s office announced that Chambers had pleaded guilty to selling drugs. On September 2, 2008, he was sentenced to 19 years on the drug charge. Chambers was released from New York&#x27;s Shawangunk Correctional Facility on July 25, 2023, after serving 15 years of his 19-year sentence. He will be on parole until 2028.

==In popular culture==
*The Sonic Youth song &quot;Eliminator Jr.&quot;, from their 1988 album &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; (1988) is about the Chambers case.
*The song &quot;Jenny Was a Friend of Mine&quot; in The Killers&#x27; album &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; (2004) was inspired by Chambers&#x27; defense of the Jennifer Levin murder charges, in which Chambers claimed he had no motive for the murder, and that he and the victim were &quot;friends&quot;.
*In 1989, the Chambers case was the basis of a TV movie titled &quot;The Preppie Murder&quot;, starring William Baldwin as Chambers and Lara Flynn Boyle as Levin.
*The 1990 &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die&quot; was based on the case.
*Mike Doyle has stated that his character Adam Guenzel on &quot;Oz&quot; (1997–2003) was based on Chambers.
*The 2003 &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Monster&quot; was based on both the Chambers case and the Central Park Jogger case.

<text>Bordesley Green is an inner-city area of Birmingham, England about two miles east of the city centre. It also contains a road of the same name. It is in the Bordesley Green Ward which also covers some of Small Heath and Little Bromwich. Bordesley Green East is in the Heartlands Ward. 

Heartlands Hospital is located in the eastern part of Bordesley Green. The area is also served by Yardley Green Medical Centre and Omnia Practice. 

Kingfisher Country Park covers the River Cole recreation grounds which are partially covered by the area&#x27;s boundaries.

Bordesley Green has a larger Eastern European community including Romanians, Poles, and Russians settling in the area, but it is still predominantly South Asian.

==History==
The name of this part of Birmingham is derived from an ancient area of demesne pasture, listed in early records dating back to 1285 as &quot;La Grene de Boreslei&quot;.

The area began to be built up in 1834, with scattered developments from Bordesley along Bordesley Green from the junction of Cattell Road and Garrison Lane as far east as Blake Lane. By 1906 urban development had spread eastwards as far as Blakesland Street and Mansell Road and included a fire station and police station, both of which survive, though the fire station no longer serves its original purpose and the police station is now a hostel for homeless people.

Many roads in Bordesley Green were built not long after the Boer War at the end of the 19th century and were named to commemorate the hundreds of soldiers from Birmingham that died in that war. Examples include Pretoria Road, named after the capital of the Boer republic of the Transvaal; Churchill Road, after Winston Churchill who fought in the Boer War, was captured but escaped; Botha Road, named after the Boer general who became the first prime minister of the Union of South Africa; and Colonial Road.

Many late-Victorian and Edwardian houses remain in Bordesley Green and much of the area has physically changed little since then.

===Industrial Hub===
At the turn of the twentieth century Bordesley Green had become a district noted for industry and manufacturing. It was the home from 1901 to 1920 of the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company&#x27;s motor cars and machine tools manufacturing plant.

The National Telephone Company&#x27;s depot in Fordrough Lane came to be one of the three major General Post Office (GPO) factories in Birmingham. The factory specialised in manual telephony, including factory repaired telephones, &quot;candlestick&quot; ‘phones, switchboards and associated components, and played a significant role in the development of the Colossus computer used to read encrypted German messages in World War II.

In the 1960s, the HANDEL Nuclear Attack Warning equipment, known as the four minute warning was manufactured in Bordesley Green, along with equipment for regional seats of government, which were part of Britain&#x27;s civil defence preparations for nuclear war.

===Blitz===
Bordesley Green was targeted during the Blitzkrieg with five raids hitting the area. The last German bomb to hit Birmingham landed on 24 April 1943 and hit Bordesley Green.

The GPO factory was also hit by German bombing raids in 1940.

==Geography==
==Wildlife==
===Tumbling Pigeons===

In the 1920s a Bordesley Green bus driver and pigeon fancier, William Penson, noticed one of his birds perform a backflip while in flight, and through selective breeding produced the Roller and Tumbler breed of pigeon. This breed is noted for its unique acrobatics while in flight and is used in ‘parlour rolling’ contests. Today there are hundreds of Birmingham Roller clubs around the world and fiercely fought competitions to pick the birds that perform the most dramatic tumbling.

==Geology==
The bedrock geology of the area consists predominantly of Sidmouth Mudstone Formation. Sedimentary Bedrock formed approximately 228 to 250 million years ago in the Triassic Period. The local environment was previously dominated by hot deserts. The types of sedimentary rocks in the Bordesley area are fluvial, lacustrine and marine in origin. They would have been detrital, deposited in lagoons or shallow seas, where a hot, arid climate would have led to the precipitation of beds of evaporites.

The superficial deposits tend to be glaciofluvial in origin, Mid Pleistocene - Sand And Gravel. Superficial Deposits in area were formed up to 2 million years ago in the Quaternary Period. The Bordesley environment would have been dominated by ice age conditions. The deposits are detrital, generally coarse-grained, forming beds, channels, plains and fans associated with meltwater.

===Lost brook of Bordesley Green===
Early maps of the area show a brook which extended from Shaw Hill down to Bordesley Green Road, which is now mostly submerged, with the exception of a small section which emerges from a culvert in Bordesley Green. It is called Washbrook. It starts up near Garrison Lane, then flows through the South African Estate, on through the allotments. It is open in Ward End Park then on into the River Tame at Bromford.

==Demography==
In 2001, an estimated 31,343 people were living in the ward making it the second most populous ward, behind Sparkbrook. This increased to 33,937 by the time of the 2011 Population Census. The ward has an area of 417.7 hectares resulting in a population density of 81.25 people per hectare.

99.7% of residents lived in households, above the city average of 98.3%. The other 0.3% lived in communal establishments. The total number of occupied households in the ward was 9,350. This results in an average of number of people per household of 3.3, higher than the city of 2.5 and national average of 2.4. The majority of households are owner occupied (58%). 20.6% of occupied households are rented from Birmingham City Council, above the city average of 19.4%. 337 houses were identified as being vacant.

Several hundred terraced houses around Bordesley Green dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were demolished in the early 1990s and new houses built on their site as part of a &quot;New homes for old&quot; initiative which allowed people to remain living in areas that their families had lived in for generations.

==Politics==
The Bordesley Green Ward was created in June 2004 out of the Small Heath and Sparkbrook wards. However the 2004 council election was marred by vote rigging by the Labour Party candidates, who were subsequently removed from the council.

The ward has been represented on Birmingham City Council by Labour councillor Raqeeb Aziz since 2022.

==Bordesley Village==
Bordesley Green has a neighbouring village, Bordesley Village, offering considerably better housing. The village is often referred as a separate area, and attempts are being made to separate the two to distinguish the areas. The village is also home to the city&#x27;s football team, Birmingham City FC, built before the village was established from an old gypsy encampment and scrap yard. Recently, the village has seen several additions, becoming the hub of the city&#x27;s new car sales and many more national companies within walking distance of the village.

The Village concept in Bordesley Green was the first &quot;Ideal Village&quot; in England, built between 1908 and 1914 by Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin. The pair eventually went on to build Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. The villages were a welcome relief to English cities at the time and the homes were built to high standards.

Daniels Road in Bordesley Green commemorates schoolteacher Francis Daniels. Originally from Ebley near Stroud, Daniels came to Birmingham in 1891 and soon saw the need to provide affordable social security for ordinary working people. With the Lord Mayor, Alderman William Kendrick as president and Daniels himself as general secretary, the Ideal Society was formed.

By 1910 the society had moved into housing provision and commenced the building of the Ideal Village at Bordesley Green, where Finnemore Road also commemorates an early chairman of the society, William Finnemore. The first houses to be built were in Drummond Road. The village, which was designed for artisan workers, has shops, a park and a school and a much lower density of housing than the nearby terraces.

St Paul&#x27;s Mission, built in 1912 in Finnemore Road as a chapel of St Margaret&#x27;s Ward End, was consecrated as a parish church in 1929. A new church was built c1970 in Belchers Lane behind the old, which was retained as the church hall. The church is now the centre of a community project embracing a number of different facilities and services.

In 1998 children from Bordesley Green Primary School discovered the origin of a badly damaged stone fountain in the Ideal Park which commemorates the rescue by a local boy of a drowning girl. On 7 May 1907 16-year-old cycle polisher, Harold Clayfield of 11 Ronald Road, jumped into a 5m deep clay pit at the junction of Belchers Lane and Bordesley Green to save 4-year-old, Florence Jones. The girl was saved, but non-swimmer Clayfield, drowned. His memorial was paid for by public subscription. Sadly Florence herself was to die only four years later as a result of playing with burning pieces of paper at her home in Green Lane.

==Public art==
The area features public art with the installation of Ondré Nowakowski&#x27;s Sleeping Iron Giant, a large head lying on its side on a mound near the St Andrew&#x27;s football ground.

==Skate park==
Bordesley Green has one skate park, known locally as the Pod. It is popular with mini BMX Rocker riders.

==Bordesley Green Allotments==
The historic Bordesley Green Allotments is a 25-acre site that is host to the Bordesley Green Forest garden and in 2012 was the venue for the Birmingham Annual Gardening Show which is normally held in Kings Heath Park.

Up to 5,000 people attended the oval track during its most popular stock car and banger racing meetings, while the speed skating team were multiple British champions in various age disciplines and the most successful roller speed club in the UK. In 2020, the operators announced that the site was under threat of closure due to failure to reach an agreement with the freeholders, Birmingham City Council, over plans to redevelop the area. The park closed for good on 31 October 2021.

<text>Esther &quot;Essie&quot; Davis is an Australian actress and singer, best known for her roles as Phryne Fisher in &quot;Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries&quot; and its film adaptation, &quot;Miss Fisher &amp; the Crypt of Tears&quot;, and as Amelia Vanek in &quot;The Babadook&quot;. Other major works include a recurring role as Lady Crane in season six of the television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, Sister Iphigenia in &quot;Lambs of God&quot;, and the role of Ellen Kelly in Justin Kurzel&#x27;s &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Davis was born on 19 January, 1970 in Hobart, Tasmania, to renowned artist George Davis and Mary Davis, the youngest of seven children. She was raised in suburban Hobart, where her family (who were part of the inception of the Australian Green movement), grew and raised their own food including turkeys.

As a child, Davis was involved in community theatre, making her stage debut at age five at Hobart&#x27;s Theatre Royal, playing the part of a moonbeam.

She was educated at Clarence High School; Rosny College; the University of Tasmania, where she was a member of the Old Nick Company; and the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in Sydney.

==Career==
Her acting career began with the Bell Shakespeare company when, straight out of NIDA, she was cast as Juliet in its 1993 production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. She followed this with performances for the company in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; in 1993, and &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; in 1994.

Davis&#x27;s film career started with her role in the 1995 Australian film &quot;Dad and Dave: On Our Selection&quot;, which starred Geoffrey Rush, Leo McKern and Joan Sutherland. Film roles continued in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, director Richard Flanagan&#x27;s 1998 Tasmanian film &quot;The Sound of One Hand Clapping&quot;, and &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;.

After further stage performances in Australia, including Gwendolen Fairfax in a national tour of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; in 2000 and &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; for the Sydney Theatre Company in 2001, in 2003 she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Stella Kowalski opposite Glenn Close in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s production of Tennessee Williams play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; at the National Theatre in London. In 2004 she starred in a Broadway production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Jumpers&quot; at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, for which she earned a Tony Award nomination. In 2005 she appeared as Mrs. Nellie Lovett in the BBC production of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; with Ray Winstone.

In the 2008 film, &quot;Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s Esther Blueburger&quot; she plays Esther&#x27;s controlling mother. Also in 2008, she appeared in the film &quot;Australia&quot; with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, directed by Baz Luhrmann. The same year, Davis played Maggie in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; for the Melbourne Theatre Company.

Davis returned to Tasmania to launch the Tasmanian Theatre Company in 2008 and help support local theatre while encouraging youth to continue participating in the arts. In 2011, she received a Logie Award nomination for her role as Anouk in the Australian miniseries &quot;The Slap&quot;. In 2012, 2013 and 2015, Davis played Phryne Fisher, the central character in ABC Television&#x27;s high-rating costume drama &quot;Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries&quot;.

Davis starred in Jennifer Kent&#x27;s 2014 debut feature &quot;The Babadook&quot;. For her work in the film Davis was nominated for an AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, an AACTA International Award for Best Actress and a Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Leading Actress.

In 2016, she joined the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in Season 6 as Lady Crane; this role did not continue into Season 7. In June 2016 she started filming &quot;The White Princess&quot;, playing Dowager Queen Elizabeth (Elizabeth Woodville). In early January 2017, the producers released a video clip from the series as a brief trailer (teaser).

In 2018, Davis filmed the mini-series &quot;Lambs of God&quot; for Foxtel, playing the role of Sister Iphigenia. It was released July 2019 in Australia and has been sold to 46 other territories. For her performance as Sister Iphigenia, Davis has been nominated for an AACTA Award for Best Lead Actress in a Drama Series.

Later the same year, Davis played Ellen Kelly in Justin Kurzel&#x27;s &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot;. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival 11 September 2019 and was released in Australian cinemas in 2020 by Transmission Films. 

Also in 2018, Davis reprised her role of Phryne Fisher from the popular television series &quot;Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries&quot; with a stand-alone action-adventure feature film, &quot;Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears&quot; With an AU$8m production budget, it wrapped production in late November 2018 and was released in cinemas in 2020.

In early 2019, Davis filmed the comedy-drama &quot;Babyteeth&quot;, playing the role of Anna. The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 76th Venice International Film Festival, where it had its world premiere on 4 September 2019.

In 2020, Davis finished filming &quot;The Justice of Bunny King&quot;, playing the title role. The film, co-starring Thomasin McKenzie, was shot in New Zealand.

<text>Fufu (or fufuo, foofoo, foufou ) is a pounded meal found in West African cuisine. It is a Twi word that originates from the Akans in Ghana. The word has been expanded to include several variations of the pounded meal found in other African countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote D&#x27;Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Benin, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, Angola and Gabon. It also includes variations in the Greater Antilles and Central America, where African culinary influence is high.

Although the original ingredients for fufu are boiled cassava, plantains, and cocoyam, it is also made in different ways in other West African countries. In Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Liberia, they use the method of separately mixing and pounding equal portions of boiled cassava with green plantain or cocoyam, or by mixing cassava/plantains or cocoyam flour with water and stirring it on a stove. Its thickness is then adjusted to personal preference, and it is eaten with broth-like soups. In Nigeria, fufu (akpu) is made solely from fermented cassava giving it its unique thickness compared to that found in other West African countries. It is eaten with a variety of soups with vegetables and lots of beef and fish. In recent years other flours, such as semolina, maize flour, or mashed plantains, may take the place of cassava flour. This is common for those in the diaspora or families that live in urban cities. Families in rural areas with access to farmland still maintain the original recipe of using cassava. Fufu is traditionally eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce.

==In Africa ==
Before the Portuguese traders introduced cassava to Africa from Brazil in the 16th century, fufu was mainly made from cocoyam, plantain, and yams. The traditional method of eating fufu is to pinch some of the fufu off in one&#x27;s right-hand fingers and form it into an easily ingested round ball. The ball is then dipped in the soup before being eaten.

===In Cote d&#x27;Ivoire ===
In Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, the word &quot;foutou&quot; is also used. Ivorian &quot;foufou&quot; is specifically mashed sweet plantains, whereas &quot;foutou&quot; is a stronger, heavier paste made of various staple foods such as yam, cassava, plantains, taro or a mix of any of those.

In the French-speaking regions of Cameroon, it is called &quot;couscous&quot; (not to be confused with the North African dish couscous).

Although people from Eastern Africa and Southern Africa seem to confuse fufu (or fufuo) with their type of corn or maize dough dish called &quot;ugali&quot; or &quot;nshima&quot;, it is not the same. Rather, &quot;ugali&quot; or &quot;nshima&quot; can be found in Ghana, where it is called &quot;akple&quot;, &quot;nsihoo&quot; (white &quot;etsew&quot; without the corn bran), or &quot;tuo zaafi&quot;, which are made from unfermented corn flour, unlike the other fermented corn dough foods such as &quot;etsew&quot;, &quot;dokuno&quot; (&quot;kenkey&quot;), &quot;banku&quot;, &quot;fonfom&quot;, among others in Ghanaian cuisine.

===In Ghana ===

It is believed to originate in what is now modern-day Ghana, by the Asante, the Akuapem, the Akyem, the Bono, and the Fante people of the Akan ethnic group of Ghana and now generally accepted across the country. According to historian Miller, &quot;the word Fufu literally means white in Twi.&quot; and is likely derived from the whitish colour of the cassava component in Ghanaian fufu. In Ghana, it is made out of pieces of boiled cassava and/or other tubers such as plantain or cocoyam. It is mostly pounded together in a locally made wooden mortar (woduro) using a wooden pestle (woma). In between blows from the pestle, the mixture is turned by hand, and water is gradually added until it becomes a soft, sticky dough. The mixture is then formed into a rounded slab and served. With the invention of the fufu machine, preparation has become much less labour-intensive. The resulting food is eaten with liquid soups (nkwan) such as light soup (nkrakra nkwan), abenkwan (palm nut soup), nkatenkwan (peanut butter soup), and abunubunu soup. Today, it also features in Beninese cuisine, Cameroonian cuisine, Guinean cuisine, Congolese cuisine, Nigerian cuisine, and Togolese cuisine, where it is eaten with hot pepper soup, okra, or other kinds of stew. Fufu&#x27;s prevalence in West African subregions has been noted in literature produced by authors from that area. It is mentioned in Chinua Achebe&#x27;s &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, for example, Fufu was a major cuisine of the Ashanti Empire. In Ghana, fufu, also known as fufuo, is white and sticky (if plantain is not mixed with the cassava when pounding).

===In Nigeria ===
In Nigeria, &quot;fufu&quot; or &quot;akpu&quot; is a popular food made from fresh or fermented cassava. The Nigerian version of Fufu is different from Ghana&#x27;s: it is however a staple food in both countries. The preparation of Yoruba fufu differs slightly from other ethnic groups. It is made from fermented cassava of which the soft pieces are sieved. The starchy remains are boiled and stirred with a wooden rod until it turns into dough. Akpu, properly punctuated as akpụ in Igbo, is the Igbo word for cassava. Requiring several days to make, akpu is a wet paste often eaten with egusi soup. Akpu is traditionally made by peeling and washing raw cassava until it is white. The cassava is soaked in water for 3–4 days to ferment and become soft. It is then filtered with a porous calabash or sieve. Excess water is quickly drained by pouring the wet paste into a sack, upon which is placed a heavy and flat item (e.g., a plank and brick). The paste is then pounded and molded into large balls and simmered for 30–60 seconds, after which it is thoroughly pounded to remove lumps, molded again into smaller balls, boiled for 15–20 minutes, and then pounded until smooth. It is popular throughout Nigeria, particularly in the SouthEast and South-South.

==In the Caribbean ==
In Caribbean nations with substantial populations of West African origin (such as Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Puerto Rico), plantains, cassava or yams are mashed with other ingredients.

In Cuba, the dish retains its original African stem name, termed simply as &quot;fufú&quot; or with added descriptive extensions like &quot;fufú de plátano&quot; or &quot;fufú de plátano pintón.&quot; In the Dominican Republic, a beloved dish, mangú, is very similar to &quot;fufú.&quot; On other major islands, &quot;fufú&quot; goes by the names of funche in Puerto Rico. What distinguishes the Caribbean &quot;fufú&quot; from its West African relative is a firmer texture with stronger flavors. As it moves away from Cuba, the &quot;fufú&quot;&#x27;s core is less a dough and more of a consistent mass.

In Haiti, it is called &quot;tonm tonm&quot; and &quot;foofoo&quot;. It is mostly made of breadfruit but can be made of plantain or yams and is usually served with an okra based stew or soup. It is primarily consumed in the southernmost regions of Haiti namely the Grand&#x27;Anse and Sud departments. The city of Jérémie is regarded as the tonmtonm capital of Haiti.

Puerto Rican mofongo, in keeping with the creolized cuisine traditions of the Caribbean, tends toward a &quot;fufú&quot; of much higher density and robust seasoning. While keeping a conspicuous African character, mofongo has borrowed from the island&#x27;s Iberian culinary tradition, to create a dish made of fried green and yellow plantains, cassava or breadfruit. Unlike the mushier Caribbean and West African &quot;fufús&quot;, mofongo is generally firmer and crustier. To prepare mofongo, green plantains are deep-fried once unlike twice fried tostones. Next, they are mashed in a &#x27;pilon&#x27; (mortar) with chopped garlic, salt, black pepper and olive oil. The resulting mash is then pressed and rounded into a hollowed crusty orb. Meat, traditionally &quot;chicharrón&quot;, is then stuffed into the chunky ball of fried green plantains. Some recipes call for a meat or vegetable &quot;salsa criolla&quot;&quot; (related to American Creole sauce) poured atop the hot sphere. In the trendier &quot;mofongo relleno&quot;, typical of western Puerto Rico, seafood is all over, inside and outside. Traditional mofongo, as previously cited, comes seasoned and stuffed with meat and bathed in a chicken broth soup. Because of its elaborate process of preparation and its sundry ingredients, poet and blogger Arose N Daghetto called the mofongo a type of &quot;fufú paella&quot; and branded it as &quot;the big daddy of fufús&quot;. Although mofongo is associated with being fried, boiled and roasting plantain mofongo predate fried mofongo and is still excited but a rare find in Puerto Rico. A dish called &quot;funche&quot; made with taro, green and yellow plantains boiled and mashed with butter, garlic, and pork fat was once popular in Puerto Rico. Once mashed it was formed into balls and eaten with broth made from sesame seeds. Funche is written in early Puerto Rican cookbooks around the 1800s, but can probably be traced back to African slaves on the island. Funche today in Puerto Rico is cornmeal cooked in coconut milk and milk.

The vegetable or fufú sauce in the Anglo-Caribbean is not fried first. Plantain is not used as much, as it is used in so many dishes. Fufu is usually part of, or added to, a soupy sauce or on the side with a soupy dish. In Antigua, fufu is served as part of the national dish but is called fungi/fungee and is made using cornmeal and okra. Similarly, in Barbados it serves as part of the national dish and is called &quot;cou-cou&quot; and uses cornmeal or, less commonly, split peas, green bananas, or breadfruit instead, like several other English Caribbean islands.

==Nutrition==
100 g dry fufu flour (made from cocoyam) contains 2 g of protein, 0.1 g of fat and 84 g of carbohydrates, and 267 calories. One serving (240g) of cooked fufu contains 3.6 g of protein, 7.2 g of fat and 81 g of carbohydrates, and 398 calories.

It is low in cholesterol and rich in potassium, and it is commonly prescribed by doctors for people who have a low level of potassium in their blood.

<text>Sir James Alfred Ewing (27 March 1855 − 7 January 1935) was a Scottish physicist and engineer, best known for his work on the magnetic properties of metals and, in particular, for his discovery of, and coinage of the word, &quot;hysteresis&quot;.

It was said of Ewing that he was &#x27;Careful at all times of his appearance, his suits were mostly grey, added to which he generally wore – whatever the fashion – a white piqué stripe to his waistcoat, a mauve shirt, a white butterfly collar and a dark blue bow tie with white spots.&#x27; He was regarded as brilliant and successful, but was conscious of his dignity and position. On appointment to head the newly created Admiralty codebreaking department, the Director of Naval Intelligence, Henry Oliver, described him as &#x27;too distinguished a man to be placed officially under the orders of the Director of Intelligence or Chief of Staff&#x27;. His first wife, Annie, was an American, a great great niece of George Washington.

==Life==

===Early life===
Born in Dundee, Scotland, Ewing was the third son of the Reverend James Ewing a minister of the Free Church of Scotland. He was educated at West End Academy and the High School of Dundee, Ewing showed an early interest in science and technology.

Ewing won a scholarship to the University of Edinburgh where he studied physics under Peter Guthrie Tait before graduating in engineering. During his summer vacations, he worked on telegraph cable laying expeditions, including one to Brazil, under William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin and Fleeming Jenkin.

===Japan===
In 1878, on Fleeming Jenkin&#x27;s recommendation, Ewing was recruited to help the modernisation of Meiji Era Japan as one of the &quot;o-yatoi gaikokujin&quot; (hired foreigners). Serving as professor of mechanical engineering at the Tokyo Imperial University, he was instrumental in founding Japanese seismology.

Ewing made two special friends at Tokyo University soon after arriving: Basil Hall Chamberlain and Lieutenant Thomas Henry James RN, who taught navigation. He was also in close contact with Henry Dyer and William Edward Ayrton at the Imperial College of Engineering (&quot;Kobu Dai Gakkō&quot;).

In Tokyo, Ewing taught courses on mechanics and heat engines to engineering students, and on electricity and magnetism to physics students. He carried out many research projects on magnetism and coined the word &#x27;hysteresis&#x27;. His investigations into earthquakes led him to help develop the first modern seismograph, alongside Thomas Gray and John Milne of the Imperial College of Engineering, from 1880 to 1895. All three men worked as a team on the invention and use of seismographs, though Milne is generally credited with the invention of the first modern horizontal-pendulum seismograph.

Ewing joined Gray and Milne in founding the Seismological Society of Japan (SSJ) in 1880.

===Return to Dundee===
In 1883, Ewing returned to his native Dundee to work at the recently established University College Dundee as its first Professor of Engineering. He was appalled by the living conditions he found in many of the poorer areas of the town which he felt compared unfavourably with those in Japan. He worked fervently with local government and industry to improve amenities, in particular sewer systems, and to lower the infant mortality rate. Some of the letters Ewing wrote at this time are now held by Archive Services, University of Dundee along with some of his other papers.

A reminder of Ewing&#x27;s connection with both University College and the city of Dundee is the University of Dundee&#x27;s Ewing Building which was built in 1954 and named in his honour. The Ewing Building is currently part of the University&#x27;s School of Science and Engineering.

===University of Cambridge===
In 1890, Ewing took up the post of Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics at the University of Cambridge, initially at Trinity College, though he later moved to King&#x27;s College. At Cambridge, Ewing&#x27;s research into the magnetisation of metals led him to criticise the conventional account of Wilhelm Weber. In 1890, he observed that magnetisation lagged behind an applied alternating current. He described the characteristic hysteresis curve and speculated that individual molecules act as magnets, resisting changes in magnetising potential. (Note: According to the book &quot;Sir Alfred Ewing: A Pioneer in Physics and Engineering&quot; (1946) by Professor Bates, the discovery of magnetic hysteresis probably occurred before Ewing. However, Ewing re-discovered it, studied it in detail and coined the word &quot;hysteresis&quot;).

Ewing also researched into the crystalline structure of metals and, in 1903, was the first to propose that fatigue failures originated in microscopic defects or &quot;slip bands&quot; in materials. In 1895 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society for his work on Magnetic Induction in Iron and other Metals.

Ewing was a close friend of Sir Charles Algernon Parsons and collaborated with him on the development of the steam turbine. During this time, Ewing published &quot;The Steam Engine and other Heat Engines&quot; around this time. In 1897 he took part in the sea-trials of the experimental vessel &quot;Turbinia&quot;, which set a new speed record of 35 knots.

In 1898, Ewing took his wife and children to Switzerland for a mountaineering holiday with the family of noted Professor of Electrical Engineering at King&#x27;s College, John Hopkinson. All five of the Hopkinson brothers were members of the Alpine Club and soon initiated Ewing into the sport of rock climbing. On 27 August, John Hopkinson set out with his son Jack and two of his three daughters to climb. Ewing decided not to go with them as he was feeling a little stiff after his climb the previous day. The party never returned, and was found the next morning, all four bodies roped together five hundred feet below the summit.

In 1898 Ewing was elected to a Professorial Fellowship at King&#x27;s College.

===Admiralty===
On 8 April 1903, &quot;The Times&quot; announced that the Board of Admiralty selected Ewing for the newly created post of Director of Naval Education (DNE) in Greenwich.

He married Anne Maria Thomasina Blackburn Washington on 14 May 1879 in Tokyo, Japan. She was a descendant of President George Washington&#x27;s brother John Augustine Washington. Ewing&#x27;s first wife, Annie (née Washington) died in 1909 and, in 1912, he married Ellen, the surviving daughter of his old friend and patron, John Hopkinson. He had two children with his first wife: Maud Janet Wills, née Ewing (20 May 1880 – 27 April 1952) and Alfred Washington Ewing (1 November 1881 – 5 December 1962).

As reward for his services, Ewing was made Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1906 and then Knight Commander of the Bath in 1911.

During World War I, from 1914 to May 1917, Ewing managed &quot;Room 40&quot;, the Admiralty intelligence department of cryptanalysis, responsible predominantly for the decryption of intercepted German naval messages. In this capacity, he achieved considerable fame in the popular press when Room 40 deciphered the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917 (which suggested a German plot to assist Mexico in recovering the southwestern United States). The publication of the Zimmermann Telegram is generally credited as the trigger event which brought American into the Great War.

===University of Edinburgh===
In May 1916 Ewing accepted an invitation to become Principal of the University of Edinburgh, in the course of which he instituted an extensive series of effective reforms and which he held until his retirement in 1929. In 1927 he gave a lecture to the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution which contained the first semi-official disclosure of the work done by Room 40. A house in Pollock Halls of Residence is named in his honour.

Sir Alfred Ewing died in 1935 and is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his second wife Lady Ellen Ewing, the daughter of John Hopkinson.

<text>Leroy Russel Burrell (born February 21, 1967) is an American former track and field athlete, who twice set the world record for the 100 m sprint.

==Early life==
Burrell grew up in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and attended Penn Wood High School, where he single-handedly won the state championship by winning the 100 m, 200 m, long jump, and triple jump. Suffering from poor eyesight accentuated by a childhood eye injury, he was poor at other sports, but excelled on the track from an early age. He attended the University of Houston from 1986 to 1990, where he was a nine-time NCAA All-American and set the NCAA outdoor record in the long jump.

==Professional career==
Burrell was plagued by injuries and bad luck throughout his career, particularly around major championships. He won gold in the 100 m ahead of Carl Lewis at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle. He won the silver in the 100 m behind Lewis at the 1991 World Championships. At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Burrell false-started in the 100 m final. When the race finally restarted, his reaction off the line was slow, and he finished fifth. He did manage to win a relay gold as part of the U.S. 4 × 100 m team.

On May 19, 1990, Burrell ran a wind-assisted 200 m at College Station, Texas, in a time of 19.61 seconds. The wind speed was +4.0 m per second. This was the fastest time for the 200 m for over six years until the 1996 Olympic final in Atlanta, where Michael Johnson ran 19.32 seconds.

He first set the 100m world record in June 1991 with a time of 9.90 seconds. This was broken that September by Carl Lewis who ran 9.86 sec at the 1991 World Track and Field Championships where Burrell finished second in a new personal best time of 9.88 sec. In July 1994, Burrell set the world record for the second time when he ran 9.85 sec (a record that stood until the 1996 Olympics when Donovan Bailey ran 9.84 sec).

Since his retirement in 1998, Burrell has replaced his old college mentor, Tom Tellez, as coach of the University of Houston&#x27;s track and field team. Burrell has led UH to 14 men&#x27;s Conference USA titles (nine indoor, five outdoor) and nine women&#x27;s titles (four indoor, five outdoor). He was inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame in 2014.

In June 2022, Burrell stepped down as head coach at Houston and accepted the head coaching position for Auburn track and field.

==Personal life==
Burrell married Michelle Finn, also a sprinter, in 1994, and they have three sons together: Cameron who was a sprinter for the Houston Cougars and died in 2021, Joshua, and Jaden. On June 7, 2017, Cameron joined his father in the sub-10 second club. Burrell&#x27;s younger sister Dawn also competed in track and field at the highest level, as a member of the 2000 US Olympic team and world indoor champion in the long jump.

<doc id="844579" wikidata="Q2348558" url="?curid=844579" title="Under Wraps (Jethro Tull album)">
<text>Under Wraps is the 15th studio album by the band Jethro Tull, released in 1984. The songs&#x27; subject matter is heavily influenced by bandleader Ian Anderson&#x27;s love of espionage fiction. It was controversial among fans of the band due to its electronic/synthesizer-based sound, particularly the use of electronic drums. Dave Pegg has been quoted as saying that the tracks cut from the sessions for &quot;Broadsword and the Beast&quot; would have made a better album, while Martin Barre has referred to it as one of his personal favourite Tull albums. The album reached No. 76 on the Billboard 200 and No. 18 on the UK Albums Chart. The single &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot; reached No. 30.

==Production==

Unlike earlier albums where Anderson was the sole songwriter, &quot;Under Wraps&quot; was the first Jethro Tull album since &quot;This Was&quot; where the majority of songs were co-written between all members of the band, primarily Peter-John Vettese.

This is also the only Jethro Tull album that features no live drummer; all the percussion tracks were programmed electronically. After the recording Doane Perry joined the band on tour and became their permanent drummer thereafter.

The original 1984 release had 11 tracks, with &quot;Astronomy&quot;, &quot;Tundra&quot;, &quot;Automotive Engineering&quot; and &quot;General Crossing&quot; only appearing on the cassette version. Of these extra tracks, &quot;General Crossing&quot; became the first Jethro Tull track never to be released on vinyl, as &quot;Astronomy&quot;, &quot;Tundra&quot; and &quot;Automotive Engineering&quot; all appeared on the 12-inch single release of &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot;.

The CD editions of the album carry all 15 tracks. The 2005 enhanced CD also contains a QuickTime video for &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot;.

==Live performances==
For the 1984 tour to promote &quot;Under Wraps&quot;, Jethro Tull offered artistic stage production as usual. In a manner quite similar to the &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; tour, the roadies appeared onstage sweeping the floor, counting the audience and studying the place. All band members and instruments were covered in &quot;wraps&quot;, with Anderson then releasing them and the music starting. Anderson was suffering from vocal problems and was warned by his doctors not to tour. Anderson ignored this advice and went on tour, straining his throat in the process of performing the album&#x27;s vocally demanding songs, resulting in surgery and an extended hiatus from the band.

<text>Castle Vale is a housing estate located between Erdington, Minworth and Castle Bromwich. Currently Castle Vale makes up the Castle Vale Ward of Birmingham City Council which is part of Erdington constituency (having previously been part of Hodge Hill constituency until recent times), northeast of Birmingham city centre in England. The area has an approximate population of 10,000 people and has a distinctly modern residential character stemming from its history as a postwar overspill estate.

The area was originally known as Berwood, from the Saxon &#x27;Bearu&#x27; meaning &#x27;the woods&#x27;. Historically being a boggy and wooded area, the area remained undeveloped for most of its history until the deforestation practices of Edward Darcy in the 17th century and the construction of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal in the 18th century. In the 20th century, the land became the site for the first aeroplane take-off in Birmingham which led to a long aviation history being associated with the area. Castle Bromwich Aerodrome was established on the site and operated from 1914 to 1960, being a major airfield in both World Wars and also having industrial importance as the testing facility for locally manufactured aeroplanes and the location for the British Industries Fair. Despite being steeped in aviation history, Castle Vale became infamous from the 1970s onwards as a large scale example of a failed postwar overspill estate, which suffered from poor construction and maintenance, social deprivation and high levels of crime. The area became the focus of a targeted regeneration initiative, led by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust (CVHAT) from 1993 to 2005, where the estate witnessed the demolition of many of its housing stock and facilities, the refurbishment of remaining properties, and the construction of new housing and facilities along with the remodelling of the estate, funded both privately and publicly.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The site has historically been a wooded area with a post-Domesday manor, although its construction date is not known. In 1160, the Manor of Berwood was given to the Abbey of St. Mary de Pratis at Leicester by the Arden family. A moated house, St Mary&#x27;s Chapel, a hermitage, a bake house and farm buildings were built for them, although St Mary&#x27;s Chapel was demolished in the 15th century after it fell into disrepair. Under the ownership of Leicester Abbey, the Arden family became tenants, despite having owned the land previously. In 1356–7, Sir John de Arderne briefly gained ownership of the property but the abbey regained it in 1360. Donations were made by the Arden family to the clergy and in 1244, a donation of land resulted in two priests being sent to the manor to maintain a shrine, pray for Sir William Arden and to assist travellers through the area. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, Thomas Arden purchased the property from King Henry VIII for £272 10s. The hall fell into disrepair and when it remained as just a shell, the property was confiscated by the Crown and given to Edward Darcy after the previous owner, Edward Arden, was convicted of treason and hanged. The son of Edward Arden started studying law and commenced several court cases to regain control of the land from Edward Darcy. When Darcy learned of a case to regain half of the land, he deforested it and moved the valuable timber to his land in Minworth, leaving a swampy area which was prone to flooding and with poor quality soil for agriculture. The hall was eventually demolished although the moat still remained into the 20th century. A later house (Berwood Hall) was built outside the moat, which was eventually the site of Berwood Hall Farm. A mill stood in Berwood on Plants Brook in the 15th century.

In 1789, the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was completed to the north of the area which gradually encouraged an industrial presence along it. In 1881, W. W. Bagot sold of land in Berwood to the Birmingham, Tame and Rea District Drainage Board, and a further were sold to the Board on 29 September 1888. Home Farm was in the north west corner, near Tyburn House, and the land consisted of a large orchard, however its main function was to spread sewage brought from the City of Birmingham over the rest of the land. In 1898, filter beds were constructed as the volume of sewage was becoming too much with the rest of the land becoming farmland or swamp, surrounded by forest.

In 1842, the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway was completed to the southeast of Castle Vale with a railway station serving the area on the line. Another railway branch, the Sutton Park Line was completed in 1879 and formed the eastern boundary of the area, roughly marking the boundary of the land in the Arden/Darcy dispute.

In 1900, John Dunlop opened a tyre factory on the opposite side of the Chester Road to where the Castle Vale housing estate now stands and gradually expanded over the next few decades to become one of the largest and most recognisable tyre factories in the world. The name of St. Mary was revived in Berwood upon the construction of the Church of St. Mary to serve people housed in nearby Nissen huts. It was dedicated on 17 December 1923 but was destroyed by fire in 1926, only to be rebuilt soon after and fall into disuse.

=== Castle Bromwich Aerodrome ===

The area was a flat plain when it became the Berwood Playing Fields. In 1909, local mechanic Louis Maxfield assembled a flying machine in Berwood Playing Fields. The plane took off and is said to have reached a height of , making it the first flight in Birmingham. The site&#x27;s suitability was investigated and it soon became the Castle Bromwich private aerodrome. By 1911, a pilot was giving demonstration flights in a Bleriot monoplane. In the London to Manchester air race of 1914, competitors stopped at the aerodrome for refuelling.

The start of World War I meant a change at Castle Bromwich Aerodrome and it was requisitioned by the War Office for use by the Royal Flying Corps and flying schools in 1915. No. 5 Flying School was established at the aerodrome in the same year. Pilots were accommodated in tents and huts located around the site and on 1 September 1915, 19 Squadron was established at the aerodrome.

In the interwar years, the aerodrome had a dual military and civilian function. In these early days, it was the busiest airport in the area due to its passenger, post and railway air business. A large tract of land adjacent to the airfield was marked out for the British Industries Fair (BIF) in 1920, which was advertised nationally. In 1937, more hangars and a Squadron Headquarters were built for the Royal Air Force and in 1939, it was extended further to become a fighter station, a base for other units and a dispatch site for aeroplanes built at Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory on the other side of the Chester Road. At its peak, the airfield would be used for testing 300 Supermarine Spitfires per month for World War II.

Various units used the airfield following the war and there was an annual display to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Britain held at the airfield. Civilian flights returned, including the first scheduled helicopter service from London. The buildings that were used for the BIF were sold as storage units for various companies. In March 1960, the airfield was closed as a result of the impending expansion of the airport at Elmdon and in 1962, the airfield site, the BIF site and nearby farmland was sold for construction of the overspill estate which started in 1964. The last hangars were demolished in 1992 for an industrial site.

There are some strong symbolic links to these times in the shape of the &quot;Sentinel&quot; sculpture, a stained glass church window, and the names of tower blocks and streets on the estate. Remnants of the airfield also exist such as a row of ex-RAF housing along Church Road. It is often said that the three main roads on the estate were the original runways on the airfield, but this is not true. Aerial photographs from the Second World War and afterwards clearly show a triangular runway layout typical of British military airfields of that era, with none of them aligned to the modern day roads.

=== Castle Vale estate ===

==== Planning ====
At the end of World War II, one third of housing within Birmingham was declared unfit for habitation and a major construction programme was needed to deal with the problem. By 1950, Birmingham City Council had been constructing municipal housing to accommodate the rising population of Birmingham and to accommodate those who had been displaced by the slum clearances in the inner-city areas of the city, similar to the process which had started some 30 years earlier when the first council houses were built. Municipal house construction developed into high-rise construction in the mid-1950s with the guidance of Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, the City Architect of Birmingham. By 1962, however, the city council was demolishing more houses than it was constructing and Fidler urged the council to adopt the French Camus system which consisted of housing at a density of approximately 50 houses per hectare and 80 people per acre. The council refused this and demanded 48 homes per hectare with 75 people per acre. In a final attempt to convince the council, he proposed a &#x27;garden city&#x27; layout for the Castle Bromwich Airfield site in 1963. This too was rejected and, as a result, Fidler resigned from his position. He was quickly succeeded by J. R. Sheridan-Shedden, the deputy City Architect who held the position temporarily. Upon taking the position, he designed a revised masterplan for the Castle Bromwich Airfield estate. The new masterplan used the Radburn Layout which consisted of super-blocks of housing, schools, retail and offices around a communal open space, a concept which was created by Clarence Stein in Radburn, New Jersey in 1929.

The council attempted to limit the damage caused to their reputation as a result of the scandal surrounding the resignation of Fidler by agreeing to embark on the major building project at Castle Bromwich with five new goals. These were increasing housing output at the estate by a further 4,000 homes, which was aimed to reduce the cost of dwellings, introducing industrialised forms of construction to save labour, attracting new national contractors to work in Birmingham, and increase capacity by providing continuous work for contractors.

==== Construction ====
At a time when major house-building firms were receiving large subsidies from the Government for the construction and pioneering prefabricated, system-built tower blocks, there was major competition between companies who offered various construction systems. Concrete Ltd. had developed a system called the Bison Wall Frame system which was offered to the council who then accepted it and commissioned Bryants as the contractor.

Construction of the layout designed by J. R. Sheridan-Shedden, which consisted of housing for 5,000 housing units along two spines of housing running along the length of the estate, commenced in 1963 and the first residents moved in a year later. The estate was completed in 1969. Reinforced concrete was the main material used due to its low cost and ease of use. 30% of the houses constructed were intended for private sale, an unusually high percentage, with most of the privately sold houses being around the Park Lane area of the estate. As well as residential properties, there was also a shopping centre in the eastern part of the estate, five schools, two churches and a swimming pool. There were some clear links to the aviation heritage of the site within the names of the roads, with the three main roads running the length of the estate being constructed on the runways of the airfield, and the 34 tower blocks that contained 2,000 flats. There were two major concentrations of tower blocks within the estate: fourteen along Farnborough Road, and the &#x27;Centre 8&#x27;, a group of eight large tower blocks in the centre of the estate. The following is a list of the tower blocks constructed on the estate.

By the end of the 1960s, Castle Vale had a population of around 20,000 people, with the first residents moving into their new homes in 1964. Many of the new residents were of Irish descent , previously living in inner-city slums such as Aston and Nechells. As well as high-rise tower blocks, Castle Vale also had 27 four-storey blocks of maisonettes, three-storey blocks of flats, over 100 bungalows and hundreds of terraced and semi-detached houses. All the houses had modern features that the houses of the slums lacked such as electricity, indoor toilets and central heating. Many of the houses also had gardens to the front and rear, while most of the flats in the tower blocks had private balconies.

A competition for the name of the estate was held early in the estate&#x27;s development and the chosen name was Castle Vale, submitted by a local schoolgirl.

==== Decline ====
When residents moved into their new homes, most were pleased with the improvement. However, the demolition of the slums and breaking up of entire communities had made people feel unsettled. The modern features meant that residents had to adapt, for example, residents were now paying for underfloor heating when they were used to cheaper coal fires. Many residents began to resent being moved and became unhappy.

Socially, the estate failed to develop into a community and the residents were in poor economic situations. The start of the decline of the estate began in the 1970s when crime rates started to increase. Rent payments were initially collected by the &#x27;rent man&#x27; who went from door-to-door, but muggings meant the service was withdrawn in the mid to late-1970s and rent had to be paid at the local post office in the shopping centre. Drug dealing also started becoming prominent in the late-1970s, with violent incidents also increasing in number. The problems continued into the 1980s with the top of Concorde Tower becoming a popular vantage point for teenagers to watch joyriders speed along the straight main roads (often in stolen cars), and to watch the police chase them. Castle Vale had six pubs, (Trade Winds, Albatross, Trees, Skylark, Artful Dodger and Lancaster), but all had closed by 1996, having been associated with drug dealing for a long time.

The economic downturns of the 1970s and 1980s saw the local manufacturing industry hit hard and unemployment on Castle Vale soared. By the late 1980s, unemployment on the estate stood at around 28% – around four times the national average at the time.

West Midlands Police struggled to operate on the estate due to recurring incidents and also incidents where officers were attacked by youths. The lack of law enforcement led to the residents feeling intimidated and helpless on the estate. In the 1980s, the police tried an alternative approach called Community Policing where hot spots for crime were tackled with more officers. The scheme received national attention but was considered to not be drastic enough to deal with the problems on the estate. By 1992, 41% of residents said they were victims of crime and 55% said they were afraid to go out at night.

The economic situation for most residents declined through the 1980s, with many of the original residents already coming from poor economic backgrounds in slums. The Birmingham Municipal Bank opened a branch in Castle Vale Shopping Centre but the last bank closed in 1987, leading to a greater reliance on illegal loan sharks. Additionally, the unemployment rate was on average 50% higher than the city average by 1992, and in some pockets of the estate, the unemployment rate was 40%. This was one of the highest levels in the country, which was in the depths of a major recession at the time, and unemployment had even continued to plague Castle Vale following the previous recession in the early 1980s after which the national unemployment level had halved within three years.

Educational attainment also suffered with 12% of Castle Vale Secondary School leavers received 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE, half the city average. Only 8% continued into further education, compared with 55% for the rest of Birmingham. The schools themselves had unsustainably low student numbers and they found it difficult to persuade teachers to continue working in the area, as well as employing new teachers.

There were also physical problems with the estate. While the design and layout had exacerbated some of the problems such as crime, there were also issues with the quality of construction of the buildings. The design of the estate was based around three main roads – Farnborough Road, Tangmere Drive and Yatesbury Avenue – which were wide and straight, lending themselves to joyriders. Many pockets of the estate were hidden from view allowing muggings to take place, as well as drug dealing and drug taking. They became litter traps and fly-tipping could occur with ease. The design of individual buildings was also of concern, with a wide range of issues such as the ease of access for arsonists to the rubbish chutes of the maisonettes, which posed a safety hazard to residents. Issues regarding the construction of the buildings were noticed early into the estate&#x27;s life. In the early 1970s, many homes were starting to experience damp and others were flooded as a result of leaking roofs. In the maisonettes, heating bills were between £300–500 quarterly and the homes remained cold in the winter. These issues regarding the construction were not confined to just the estate, but most other estates constructed in the Bison construction system. Birmingham City Council was eventually depleted of funds for the maintenance of the blocks and lift breakdowns became common, and were further aggravated by repairers refusing to work without security enforcement. They were also reports of teenage troublemakers setting fire to the staircases in the tower blocks. In 1991, a large concrete panel fell from one of the tower blocks and, although nobody was injured, it was reported locally and helped spark efforts for the regeneration of the estate to begin.

== Regeneration ==

=== Establishing the Housing Action Trust ===
The state of Castle Vale became a serious concern for Birmingham City Council and in July 1991, Derek Waddington, the then director of housing for Birmingham City Council, heard about a Housing Action Trust in North Hull. After further research, he recommended this to Dick Knowles, then leader of Birmingham City Council, for Castle Vale. He produced a presentation to the council in Autumn 1991 to convince the council of the potential of the scheme. The following day, the council approached the Department for the Environment, the predecessor to the Department for Communities and Local Government, on how to approach the establishment of a Housing Action Trust at Castle Vale. In December 1991, Michael Heseltine announced to Parliament that Castle Vale had become the latest candidate for Housing Action Trust status. In 1992, Richard Temple Cox, a local architect, was appointed shadow chairman for the Housing Action Trust and was given the job of persuading residents on the estate to vote in favour of establishing the HAT. He entered negotiations with a Community Action Team, which had been established for the estate in 1992, to determine the size and composition of the board for the HAT. They agreed on a board of twelve members, with four resident representatives, three local authority councillors, and five independent members.

Following campaigning by the council to convince residents to vote in favour of the HAT, a ballot date of 18 March 1993 was announced. The ballot had a resident turnout of 74%, and the results were announced on 15 April 1993 with 92% voting in favour of the HAT. Castle Vale Housing Action Trust was formally established on 30 June 1993 and Angus Kennedy was appointed as Chief executive and the first permanent board member on 23 November 1993. The Housing Action Trust, locally known as &quot;The HAT&quot;, was given a 12-year objective to regenerate the estate using both publicly and privately funded means. On 31 March 1994, 3,746 homes housing approximately 11,000 people in an area covering approximately was transferred to the HAT from Birmingham City Council.

=== Masterplanning ===
In April 1994, Hunt Thompson Associates were appointed by the HAT as master planners and work on the plan commenced in the following month. The master planners conducted an in-depth survey and public consultations with residents and local businesses over a six-month period to establish the issues within the estate and their causes. A draft masterplan followed by a refined document were sent to Birmingham City Council for their consideration.

These plans, to be carried out for up to 12 years while the HAT was in existence, were for the demolition of 1,416 homes including 17 of the 34 tower blocks and 24 of the 27 maisonette blocks. Of the tower blocks proposed for demolition were the Centre 8 blocks, four tower blocks on the northern section of the estate, one tower block which stood atop the main shopping centre (also earmarked for demolition) and four more tower blocks on the southern part of the estate. Up to 1,100 homes were to be constructed on the sites released by demolition. The remaining tower blocks which included the fourteen on Farnborough Road and Concorde Tower were to be refurbished with new insulation and security features. The other low-rise residential properties were also to be refurbished in Neighbourhood Strategies. Economic proposals included the large-scale redevelopment of Castle Vale Shopping Centre to create a modern hub for the community and for new offices to be constructed for the community organisations. Plans for an upgrade of the medical services were already advancing when the masterplan was being produced.

The plans were later adjusted during demolition and recommended the demolition of 32 of 34 tower blocks, with the remaining two being refurbished. They were saved from demolition as they were constructed as part of a complex with primary schools and the demolition of the towers would necessitate the demolition of the schools, which the HAT and Birmingham City Council wanted to avoid. To regenerate the shopping area in the centre of the estate, Associated Architects and Gillespies were appointed to produce a masterplan for the site to include new shopping facilities and other community facilities.

=== Demolition and construction ===

==== Environmental and housing schemes ====

Preparations for the demolition of properties commenced as soon as the masterplan was approved. The first phase of preparations for demolition began in June 1995 when the first four of the &quot;Centre 8&quot; blocks were demolished. The other four blocks in this section were demolished a year later. The four &quot;bison wall&quot; tower blocks - Valiant, Meteor, Hermes and Ensign Houses - were demolished in 1997, along with Albert Shaw House. The decision was then made to demolish Concorde Tower as well as the 14 Farnborough Road tower blocks, which had originally been earmarked for refurbishment. During the clearance process, security were employed to guard the site constantly to protect remaining residents and to prevent looting. All 27 of the maisonette blocks were eventually demolished, including the three which were initially earmarked for refurbishment. All but one of the Farnborough Road tower blocks had been demolished by the end of 2000, with Vulcan House initially being retained as accommodation for doctors and nurses while improvements took place at NHS staff homes near to Heartlands Hospital. However, Vulcan House was significantly under-occupied for this purpose, and it was finally demolished in 2002. Andover, Hercules, Ternhill and Oakington Houses were demolished afterwards.

By 2004, all remaining tower blocks, with the exception of Chivenor and Topcliffe House, had been demolished along with the remaining maisonette blocks and an additional 114 bungalows. Both of the surviving tower blocks were incorporated into neighbouring schools, and were earmarked for retention from the outset, as their demolition would have resulted in the need to build replacement schools elsewhere in the local area.

Demolition work was conducted by demolition contractors who competed for the various contracts offered by the HAT. The complexity of these contracts led to confusion sometimes between the contractors and the HAT. In one case, between the HAT and Demolition Services Ltd., where Demolition Services Ltd. had been contracted to demolish two 13-storey tower blocks and remove asbestos from the insulation panels, legal advice was sought by the contractor after they discovered further asbestos in the finishes to the ceilings, walls and floors. Demolition Services Ltd. wanted an additional payment of £300,000 but the HAT argued that the removal of these features were part of the contract. Nonetheless, the HAT were forced to make the additional payment in court.

For some residents who had been moved out of their homes, temporary accommodation was provided in a process known as &#x27;decanting&#x27;. On the day of moving, the HAT provided removal services for them and also gave them £800 on the day to cover any costs and for the inconvenience. Properties that were used for decanting were usually temporarily refurbished prior to residents moving in and were located on the estate itself.

The demolition of these properties opened up vast tracts of land for the HAT and plans were drawn up with various architects and contractors to develop these sites, mainly for residential purposes to house the displaced families. Significant focus was placed on the quality of design and the use of low-energy features to make the estate more sustainable. New roads were constructed on the sites of the demolished tower blocks and often took the names of them, such as Avro Way, Lysander Boulevard and Trident Boulevard.

Axis Design Collective became involved in the regeneration of the estate from 1995, being involved in the consultation of the design of new-build residential properties. They first worked on the Neighbourhood Strategy for the area surrounding Sopwith Croft between 1995 and 1996. This led to their involvement in the design of 42 rented homes in the Sopwith Croft area which were built from 1998 to 2000. During the same period, 33 infill homes and bungalows were constructed on Neville Walk and Chigwell Close, as well as a bungalow development aimed at disabled people on Howes Croft which was completed in 1999. Later on, Axis were also involved in the design of a low-energy courtyard development with 21 bungalows on Tangmere Drive and Drem Croft, and also with the design of 22 rented family homes on Bond Drive in 2000. Their final work in Castle Vale was related to the construction of 42 houses and flats in phase 2 of the scheme to redevelop the site of Concorde Tower in 2000. In total, Axis designed 200 new properties in Castle Vale.

In the Watton Green area of the estate, eleven houses were completed in February 2001 with a focus on low-energy features. Designed by PCKO Architects and built by Focus Housing Group, they broke the trend of new homes constructed entirely of brick on the estate. The shells of these buildings were constructed quickly with insulated wall panels and roof pieces, manufactured using recycled newspaper and containing no foam or resin. The internal walls are not load-bearing, allowing changes to the plans of the buildings in the future. The buildings are clad in cedar cladding and Tresca panels. For water conservation, low flush toilets, aerated taps and water butts were installed. Altogether, the scheme cost £958,000, with an average unit cost of £87,000.

Refurbishment projects were carried out on the remaining tower blocks and three-storey blocks of flats. The first of the refurbishments of the two tower blocks commenced in 2002 with Chivenor House. A subtle refurbishment was planned with the entire exterior being covered in an insulated render and painted a cream colour. The ground floor and basement were refurbished providing communal facilities for the local residents including a hairdressing salon, communal lounge, communal kitchen and television room. A concierge was located on the ground floor to ensure security of access and part of the basement was linked to the school. A crèche was also provided. The stairwells were reglazed with Reglit glazing and new windows were provided in powder-coated aluminium frames, which were of better quality than the previous window frames. The refurbishment was completed in 2006 at a cost of £3 million. The refurbishment of Topcliffe House commenced in November 2003 as the final refurbishment project by the HAT in the area. A design competition was held for a high-profile design for the building with BM3 Architecture, the architects of the Chivenor House refurbishment, winning the competition. Metal balconies and brightly coloured louvres were installed on the building to radically change the exterior. The crown of the building is surrounded by metal panels similar to those used on the balconies with the name &#x27;Topcliffe&#x27; etched into it. These panels shield the antennas on the roof from view. The refurbishment was completed in May 2005 at a cost of £2.7 million.

Farnborough Road and the immediate area became a hive of construction activity in CVHAT&#x27;s existence. A self-build scheme was pioneered here by Birmingham Co-operative Housing Services and Accord Housing Association. Starting in May 2008, the scheme involved the construction of 14 mock-Tudor style homes by their future tenants. At the project&#x27;s outset, those involved in the construction of the buildings were unemployed but had gained full-time jobs by the project&#x27;s completion. Another construction project was Farnborough Road children&#x27;s home, the first children&#x27;s home in the city for 20 years. The eight-bed centre was constructed as a result of a partnership between Birmingham&#x27;s Social Services Department, CVHAT, Walker Troup Architects, and design and build contractor Lovell Partnerships. The children&#x27;s home was part of a larger housing scheme by Lovell Partnerships and designed by Walker Troup Architects which proved to be the last large-scale residential construction project for the HAT. The scheme consisted of 237 homes, of which, 211 were for rent and 26 were offered for sale in the scheme which cost £22.7 million. Construction commenced in October 2002.

By 2000, 1,500 properties had been demolished while 700 new homes had been constructed and a further 786 had been refurbished. In March 2000, CVHAT owned 1,587 properties while housing associations owned 610 and 1,456 were owner-occupied. In 2001, Ron Hull Demolition were appointed for the remainder of the demolition work on the estate. By 2002, the HAT had constructed 1,486 new properties and reinstated 2,262 displaced households in the newly constructed or refurbished properties.

==== Commercial and employment schemes ====
Although there was a major focus on improving the housing stock on the estate, CVHAT had to tackle the other facilities and a major priority was the redevelopment of Castle Vale Shopping Centre. In 1996, Sainsbury&#x27;s were invited to tender for the redevelopment of the shopping centre, which they won. The company commenced a period of consultation with the community and produced a planning application for the construction of a retail park on the site with 700 car parking spaces. Schal, the construction management company of Carillion, were appointed as contractors for the scheme. The first phase to be constructed was an office and retail block which became occupied by the CVHAT and a dentist&#x27;s surgery. Construction of the rest of the retail park was completed in July 2000, with the Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket store opened on 29 July 2000. The demolition of the shopping centre and Concorde Tower resulted in 11,000 tonnes of concrete rubble, which was reused in the construction phase with the surplus being given to Project Wagtail. Schal consulted the community to distinguish how to minimise disruption on the estate, leading to the relocation of a bus-stop, the use of vibro-piling over rapid piling and also improvements to footpaths in the general area. Carillion Craft Training were brought in to employ residents on the estate to work on the construction to help tackle the unemployment rate. The opening of the Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket in the anchor unit and of non-food retail units, which are fully occupied by Comet, T.K. Maxx, Argos and ScS, led to the creation of approximately 600 jobs. Initially, 38% of those working at the retail park were local residents, but this figure increased to 95% within five years. Sainsbury&#x27;s then worked closely with the community to help support the local radio station and football team. In total, the project cost £35 million.

Another shopping area identified as needing significant redevelopment was Reed Square in the centre of the estate. Associated Architects and Gillespies were appointed as master planners and an outline planning application was approved in August 2002. Associated Architects were appointed for the design of buildings on the site including an educational complex named C3, a West Midlands Police sector base, and a new retail and office block. Planning consent for these were obtained in 2003 and 2004. The first phase of the scheme regarded implementation of infrastructural improvements for the area, such as the construction of Castle Vale High Street and a public square around St. Cuthberts Church. Bluestone plc were appointed as contractors for this phase following a competitive tender process. This phase was completed in November 2004, along with the retail and office units. The police sector base was completed in October 2004. The estimated total cost of the scheme is £26 million, with funding coming from the European Regional Development Fund, the Learning and Skills Council, Birmingham City Council, the Home Office and Castle Vale Community Housing Association.

Further employment opportunities for the estate were provided through the construction of Enterprise Park in the east of the estate, on the site of the last remaining hangars for the airfield at Park Lane. Completed in April 2000 to a design by David Rowbotham Ltd., the business park provided 44 small to medium business units on a site. Construction commenced in February 1999 with Galliford Midlands appointed as the contractor. The project cost £3.364 million, with funding coming from Advantage West Midlands, Castle Vale HAT, Ashtenne plc and the European Regional Development Fund. The park was completed ahead of schedule and officially opened by Alex Stephenson, chairman of Advantage West Midlands, in June 2000. Following its completion, approximately 200 jobs have been created.

==== Crime reduction ====
Crime was one of the significant issues affecting the residents of the estate and various initiatives were employed by CVHAT to reduce crime rates. Despite these measures, crime rose on the estate until near the end of the HAT&#x27;s existence. Initially, crime reduction measures were fragmented and poorly implemented. The establishment of ValeWatch in June 1997, a partnership between West Midlands Police and CVHAT which organised monthly meetings where intelligence on offenders was shared, brought about a more co-ordinated approach to tackling crime. In 1998, a series of Community Safety Forums were held which were public events for the residents where they could express concerns that they had. These meetings were attended by approximately 200 people. Working groups, which consisted of residents, CVHAT staff and agency representatives, were set up as a result of the forums to tackle specific issues affecting the estate. One working group focussed on the use of CCTV on the estate to improve surveillance on troublespots. The HAT submitted a bid for £450,000 to the Government&#x27;s Crime Reduction Programme which led to the installation of 29 new CCTV cameras.

ValeWatch also allowed the HAT to tackle the source of crime in the estate and, in 1998, evicted the ringleaders of the Green Box Gang, which was small, notorious gang consisting mainly of teenage troublemakers. These were the first evictees from the estate. In Autumn 2000, CVHAT sought the eviction of five families who were accused of persistently breaking their tenancy conditions. This was considered to be a landmark case as it used a multi-trial approach where all five families could be tried at once, saving the HAT time and money. A further 20 families were given Notices of Seeking Possession during 2000, and the HAT collated evidence and built cases against the families. During this time, some of the families improved their behaviour while others left the estate. Those that were taken to court saw cases that involved 112 witness statements, supported by covert surveillance footage in some instances.

A major problem on the estate in the past was the presence of joyriders exploiting the straight main roads that ran the length of the estate. To tackle this, the HAT employed a traffic calming scheme in April 1998. This was done by installing speed bumps, mini-roundabouts and narrowing road lanes. An issue for residents was securing their property from thieves and so the HAT provided burglar alarms and car steering locks. In February 1999, 59 Home Wardens were introduced to the estate to help protect property and forge links between residents and community groups. As they had no law enforcement powers, funding was provided for two extra police officers for three years. A centre was also set up for dealing with any reports of racial harassment on the estate.

==== Results ====
The regeneration of the estate has led to noticeable successes and all the key objectives were met. While the physical changes to the profile of Castle Vale were the most noticeable, there were significant improvements to the overall health, economic situation, social lives and educational attainment of estate residents, as well as reductions in crime rates. Some improvements were progressive with regeneration of the estate, while others became apparent at the end of CVHAT&#x27;s existence.

In 1992, the Health Needs Assessment stated that the average life expectancy of Castle Vale residents was 68.3 years, compared to the national average of 75.9 years. Between 1992 and 2005, the average life expectancy in Castle Vale rose by approximately seven years. This was the result of measures to tackle drug and alcohol abuse on the estate as well as improving the quality of life. Residents became more house proud and so kept their houses cleaner, reducing the risk of infections. People were also more willing to visit the newly constructed Health Village on Tangmere Drive.

The lack of employment opportunities had led to a high unemployment rate and a dependence on loan sharks amongst residents on the estate. The construction of the Enterprise Park and two shopping centres provided new employment opportunities to hundreds of people. Merlin Venture was created to provide employment opportunities to residents in a variety of sectors. Unemployment on the estate has dropped from 26% in 1993, to 5.6% in October 2004. The Castle Vale Credit Union was approved by the Registrar of Friendly Societies in September 1998, offering saving services and cheap loans. By June 2004, it had 640 members. Despite this, there are still high levels of poverty and a survey in 2004 found that 39% of respondents earned between £5,000 and £10,000, with nearly a third earning less than £5,000. In 2004, the estate remained just outside the top 10% most deprived areas in England.

Crime rates remained largely unaffected in Castle Vale until towards the end of the HAT&#x27;s existence. Crime rates began to fall in 2001, and between 2000 and 2004, the number of crimes committed in Castle Vale reduced by 36%, although the fear of crime still remained high amongst residents. West Midlands Police has launched a series of initiatives aimed at tackling specific causes of crime on the estate. They are also assisted by five Neighbourhood Wardens, who have no powers for arrest or enforcement but act as intermediaries between the police and community.

Castle Vale Housing Action Trust was dissolved on 31 March 2005, and all its assets were passed on to English Partnerships. It was succeeded by numerous organisations to maintain the work of the HAT. During the HAT&#x27;s lifetime, it demolished 2,275 homes, refurbished 1,333 homes and constructed 1,464 homes. 1,461 jobs were created and 3,415 training places were created. It received £197.5 million of Government funding and £102.7 million of private funding and additional leverage. It had won awards from the Government and Birmingham Civic Society.

Traffic calming strategies were put in place by the HAT, but it took the tragic death of Callum Henry in September 2011 before Castle Vale had its first zebra crossing constructed. This was the result of the reaction of Castle Vale residents, work by local councillors, the Road Safety Group, and a petition delivered to Birmingham City Council, received as one of the largest they had ever received.

==Education==
To serve the needs of the community in the 1960s, five schools were constructed on the estate; four primary schools and one secondary school. These schools continue to operate, despite past instances of poor student numbers.

=== Primary schools ===
Chivenor Junior and Infant School is a co-educational primary school constructed during the 1960s. As Birmingham City Council was not willing to demolish the primary school during the regeneration of the estate in the 1990s, the Chivenor House tower block constructed above the primary school was saved from demolition and refurbished. Upon the last OFSTED inspection of the school in February 2007, there were approximately 330 pupils and the headteacher was S. Holloway. The pupil population of the school was found to be mostly British White with one fifth of pupils being of an ethnic minority. Those requiring free school meals was &quot;exceptionally high&quot;.

Pegasus Primary School is a co-educational primary school constructed during the 1960s, and is located on Turnhouse Drive in the northeast of the estate. Upon the last OFSTED inspection of the school in November 2007, there were 181 pupils on roll and the headteacher was Robert Lee. It was inspected on 4 October 2006 and was given a Notice to Improve. Between these two inspections, there was significant staff turnover and the 2007 inspection found that sufficient steps had been taken to improve the school and that an additional Notice to Improve was not needed. The primary school&#x27;s pupil population is mostly British White and an &quot;above average&quot; proportion are entitled to free school meals, as is the proportion of pupils identified as having learning difficulties or disabilities.

St Gerard&#x27;s RC Junior and Infant School is a voluntary aided co-educational primary school with Roman Catholic denomination, constructed during the 1960s along with the rest of the housing estate. It is located on Yatesbury Avenue in the north of the estate, adjacent to St Gerard&#x27;s Church. The school has a nursery which, in 2008, for the first time, accepted children in the early stages of learning English. The school accepts pupil from the local area and diocese. Upon the last OFSTED inspection of the school in May 2008, there were approximately 220 pupils on roll and the headteacher was David Hird. One quarter of children were from ethnic minorities with the rest being British White. The proportion of pupils with learning difficulties or disabilities was below average, however the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals was above average.

Topcliffe Primary School is a co-educational primary school constructed along with the rest of the estate during the 1960s. It is located on Hawkinge Drive in the northwest of the estate. Like Chivenor Junior and Infant School, the primary school was constructed on the side of a tower block named Topcliffe House, and during the regeneration of the estate in the 1990s, Birmingham City Council were unwilling to demolish the primary school and so retained the tower block and refurbished it. Upon the last OFSTED inspection of the school in June 2007, there were approximately 250 pupils and the headteacher was Chris Robinson, although Ian Lowe now holds this position with Chris Robinson holding the Deputy Headteacher position. The school has provision for children with special educational needs as a result of the fact that the attainment of pupils when they enter the school at the age of 4 is below average. For pupils who have speech and language difficulties, there is specialist provision in two classes.

=== Greenwood Academy ===

Castle Vale Comprehensive School opened in newly constructed, purpose-built premises in 1967, although the buildings were completed and officially opened in 1969. At its peak in the early 1970s, it had 1,100 students, but this declined to 362 students by 1993 as truancy became widespread problem on the estate. Half of the building was empty and this space was occupied by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust. As the HAT neared the end of its life, the school needed to reoccupy this space as demand started to increase again. The school&#x27;s reputation was completely changed during the HAT&#x27;s existence and the school now has waiting lists for prospective students.

The school now has approximately 870 students, aged 11–16, of which 25% live outside of the estate. It has specialist Performance Arts College status, which it obtained in 2002, and became an extended school in 2006. The school converted to academy status in January 2013 and was renamed Greenwood Academy.

=== C3 ===
C3 is an educational complex in the centre of estate that was constructed to a design by Associated Architects in 2006 and consists of Castle Vale Library and a community campus originally constructed for Josiah Mason College. When Josiah Mason College was merged into Sutton Coldfield College, it became a campus to Sutton Coldfield College. The college has merged with Matthew Boulton College and has become the property of Birmingham Metropolitan College. As of 2014, Jaguar Land Rover in partnership with ManPower has occupied part of the ground floor for educational and recruitment assessment purposes.

== Features of interest ==

=== Shopping ===
The retail facilities are concentrated in two areas on the estate: Castle Vale Retail Park and Reed Square. Castle Vale Retail Park is constructed on the site of Castle Vale Shopping Centre and features large units for major chains. In contrast to this, Reed Square, another modern shopping area, features small retail units fronting onto High Street.

Castle Vale Retail Park was built by Sainsbury&#x27;s who occupy the largest retail unit in the complex. They also operate a petrol station near the retail park&#x27;s entrance at the Chester Road. Other retailers include: B&amp;M Home Bargins, Smyths Toy Store, TK Maxx, Argos and a furniture store. A separate unit was constructed to the east of the retail park at a later date and is now occupied by Betterlife Mobility (a mobility shop by Lloyd&#x27;s pharmacy). Smaller retail units are provided in a building next to the Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, with the Post Office as one of the tenants. There is a public square to the rear of the Betterlife Mobility unit with a sculpture in its centre called &quot;New Birth&quot;.

Reed Square is in the centre of the estate and was master-planned by Gillespies and Associated Architects who later produced more detailed designs for Castle Vale Library and Castle Vale Police Station within the master plan. The site covers and is generally surrounded by housing with some office and educational premises to the southwest. The site previously accommodated shopping facilities which were underused and so the HAT decided to construct a High Street through the centre of the site to make it a community hub.

=== Parkland ===
The provision of green space for the community was a major priority for the HAT and the demolition of the Centre 8 tower blocks allowed for the creation of a new park. The result was Castle Vale Centre Park on Tangmere Drive. It is a landscaped area with a play area and formal bedding areas. It was completed in 2003 and became the first new public park in the city for a decade. It was designed by Fira and Birmingham City Council&#x27;s Landscape Practice Group. A lighting scheme was devised by DW Windsor Lighting. In 2006, the park won the Civic Trust&#x27;s Green Flag Award.

Project Wagtail was the brainchild of resident Jez Lilley who received a £15,000 grant from Birmingham City Council in 1988 to help transform an area of wasteland to the south of the estate into a nature reserve. He campaigned to schools and businesses and around 500 people helped plant trees and shrubs in the area. Lilley also established a gardening club and was given an office at The Fort Centre, on Farnborough Road. The office became a drop-in centre for unwanted pets and a bird of prey centre was set up, housing fourteen birds. Lilley also envisaged a footpath to encircle the estate and this idea was presented to Richard Temple Cox in 1994, who later offered Lilley a job as Community Development Officer with an environmental remit. Project Wagtail became his priority and it was funded over the next two years by the HAT, Groundwork Birmingham and Birmingham City Council. The end result was a network of footpaths around the perimeter of and bisecting the estate. This provided opportunities for the installation of public art and also provided pedestrian access to amenities. As part of the project, incidental open spaces were created, for example at Thomas Walk in the centre of the Watton Green area of the estate and Innsworth Green in Manby East and West. Innsworth Green is more landscaped than that at Thomas Walk.

=== Public art ===
As part of the area&#x27;s regeneration, an arts initiative was established which has led to the installation of five pieces of public art within the area. The Community Arts Strategy was established in 1997 with Tim Tolkien appointed as Artist in Residence who commissioned five pieces of public art in the area by 1999. One of the most recognisable pieces to be created as a result of the initiative is the &quot;Sentinel&quot; sculpture by Tim Tolkien. It was erected on the A452 roundabout located between the estate and the Jaguar factory in 2000. The roundabout was subsequently renamed &quot;Spitfire Island&quot;. It celebrates the area&#x27;s connection with the Supermarine Spitfire fighter plane. Tolkien also worked with youth and community groups in Castle Vale to produce eleven &quot;Dream Seats&quot; which were artistically designed benches that were installed around the estate.
Another large metal sculpture that was designed for Castle Vale is the &quot;Knight of the Vale&quot;sculpture, overlooking the roundabout at Farnborough Road and Tangmere Drive. The piece was the result of a Public Consultation competition held by Castle Vale Housing Action Trust in conjunction with Sainsbury&#x27;s for a large scale art feature at the estate&#x27;s entrance. John McKenna won the competition with 74% of the public&#x27;s vote in favour of his proposal of a knight on horseback. The piece was fabricated totally in stainless steel and mirror polished for sculptural effect, it was entirely created at his studio in Worcestershire and was unveiled in October 2002. The sculpture is placed on a plinth and made out of 3 tons of stainless steel and measuring in height.

McKenna said of the sculpture concept &quot;The idea of the Knight was as a protective inspirational character to the local residents, a fearless champion, leaping out of the old castle (vale) into a new unknown future, supported by the pillars of the people, who form the bedrock of the community, supporting the regeneration.&quot;

Project Wagtail led to the creation of a further three pieces of public art. A sculpture named &quot;Trees&quot; was erected by Jo Naden in 2002 following a study of plants with pupils at the local schools. At one of the highest points on Park Lane, Angelo Bordonari&#x27;s &quot;Memories of Castle Vale&quot; stands in the form of three stones. It was created with the help of the older generations on the estate who gave their stories of their memories of the estate. Also on Park Lane is a floral mural by Paul Hill named &quot;Inset&quot;. Installed in 2002 with the help of St. Gerards Primary School pupils, it charts the history of the estate.

=== Public services ===
To sustain the needs of the community, there are various services available to them for recreational purposes. Some services were constructed along with the rest of the estate during the 1960s while others were added as part of the regeneration of the estate.

There is a neighbourhood office located on High Street which is operated by Birmingham City Council. It is open three days a week and provides advice and deals with enquiries from local residents. Other Birmingham City Council-operated facilities include Castle Vale Community Leisure Centre on Farnborough Road which hosts badminton courts, gymnasiums, a school hall with stage and grass pitches for football. Also included in the complex is the Castle Pool &amp; Adventure Playland which features a swimming pool and a play area for children. One of the newest and most-recognisable facilities to be built in the area is Castle Vale Library, part of the C3 complex, located on High Street. Completed in December 2005 and opened on 6 March 2006, it was designed by Birmingham-based Associated Architects at a cost of £3.7 million with funding from the council, European Regional Development Fund and the Learning and Skills Council. There are 27 public computer terminals and an additional 60 study places in the building. The distinctive building features a curved double-height corner feature, topped by a sharp Tecu Bronze-clad apex.

The Sanctuary is a building on Tangmere Drive which serves as a venue for community events and a meeting point for many community organisations. Castle Vale Community Housing Association now maintains the building on behalf of the Castle Vale Community Care Partnership. Construction started in November 1998 and was completed in August 1999. It was officially opened by Sir Michael Lyons on 24 May 2000. It was funded by Castle Vale Community Housing Action Trust, Allied Dunbar and Birmingham Health Authority, who funded the building as part of the health village which has developed around Tangmere Drive. The building was designed by TSP Architects.

Also part of the medical village are Eden Court Medical Practice and Castle Vale Primary Care Centre. Castle Vale Primary Care Centre was officially opened on 21 February 2005 by then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, although it had opened to patients on 13 December 2004 having been completed seven weeks ahead of schedule. Building work was undertaken by Costain Group and the building was designed by Gilling Dod. It is managed by Eastern Birmingham Primary Care Trust. It was constructed to replace a previous centre and is twice the size of its predecessor, allowing minor surgical operations to be performed at the centre. The building cost £4 million, £1 million of which was given by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust with the rest funded by the NHS. Eden Court is further along Tangmere Drive and is a GP surgery operated by the NHS. The building was opened in 2001 and features a courtyard in the centre. As well as serving the needs of the local area, the building is also used by medical students.

== Transport ==
Castle Vale is bounded to the north and the west by the Kingsbury Road (A38) and the Chester Road (A452) respectively, and to the south and the east by the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway and the Sutton Park Line, which join in the eastern part of the estate. Neither of the railway lines carry local passenger services which serve Castle Vale, although Castle Bromwich railway station did serve this location from 1842 until 1968, when the Castle Vale estate neared completion. There are now plans to reopen this station for passenger services.

However, at present, the public transport system serving Castle Vale remains a road-based service. Numerous bus routes operated by National Express West Midlands pass through or around the estate, travelling mainly along the three main roads. These access the estate from two locations: Tangmere Drive from Spitfire Island, and Park Lane from Water Orton Lane. The Manby Lane junction with Kingsbury Road (A38) to the north is another access point for motorists into the estate but is not used by buses. There is also another entrance at Castle Vale Retail Park, although this is used mainly by drivers wishing to access the car park or Sainsbury&#x27;s petrol station. This was designed so that it would not be used as a thoroughfare into the estate. There is an extensive cycle-path network around the estate which follows the main roads and Project Wagtail.

In March 1995, the Castle Vale Hopper bus service was introduced as a pilot service for one year following a feasibility study by the CVHAT into internal transport links on the estate. This service was run by Serverse Travel for the first year, there was a Fare of 20 pence to use the service. On the day the route started it was declared open by the Actor Stephen Lewis, famous for his role as inspector Blake (Blakey) in the situation comedy On The Buses. The service was considered a success and was rolled out permanently with the service number 696. The bus service is the only route operated by Valley Travel, the transport arm of Merlin Venture, and follows a circular clockwise route around the estate.

When Parliamentary Approval was granted for the construction of West Midlands Metro Line Two, approval was also granted to the construction of a spur to Castle Vale. The proposed route entered the estate from Chester Road onto Tangmere Drive and on to a terminus at Reed Square. Neither lines have started construction.

== Sport ==

Castle Vale benefits from numerous sporting facilities which are open to all residents. A local charity Castle Pool Community Partnership now runs the Castle Pool after a Community Asset Transfer was completed in January 2015 and the swimming pool features a pool while the Castle Vale Community Leisure Centre has badminton courts, gymnasiums and grass pitches for football.

An additional facility is the Vale Stadium on Farnborough Road which hosts a grandstand, overlooking the main pitch which is then surrounded by several other grass pitches for football. The stadium is used by Romulus F.C., Castle Vale JKS F.C. and Castle Vale F.C., the latter two a result of an amalgamation of the now-defunct original Paget Rangers F.C., who played their last match at the stadium on 23 April 2002, and Pinnacle Sports F.C. Castle Vale F.C. is a more established football club than Castle Vale JKS F.C., although it has its roots in Kings Heath. They became Castle Vale F.C. following a series of name changes that reflected their change of ground. Castle Vale JKS F.C. was established in 1998 as a youth team on the estate and has now diversified into establishing an adult men&#x27;s team and a girls team. In 2008, Sutton Coldfield United F.C.&#x27;s under-17 team merged with Castle Vale JKS F.C. and became known as Castle Vale JKS&#x27;s under-18 team.

Planning permission was granted in March 2009 for the provision of new judo, dance and gym facilities at the stadium. The plans are estimated to cost £3 million.

== Media ==
Castle Vale is served by 107.5 Switch Radio, a community radio station and free bi-monthly newspaper Tyburn Mail, both of which were started by CVHAT and were operated by Headline Media Birmingham. As of April 2013, The station was granted a Community Broadcast Licence by OFCOM.

The community radio station originally started out in 1995 when young residents staged the first Vale FM temporary licence broadcast (RSL) from Topcliffe House with funding from the HAT. A further broadcast took place in 1996, firmly establishing local support for a community broadcasting service in Castle Vale. This led to the creation of Castle Vale Community Radio (CVCR), also known as Vale FM. In 1998, the organisation&#x27;s premises within Topcliffe House were completely fitted out with new facilities which included two broadcast studios, a training room, digital recording facilities and office space. Since 1997, the organisation has run fifteen radio skills training programmes for approximately 230 unemployed participants in partnership with East Birmingham College, part of City College Birmingham. In addition, a total of seventeen Restricted Service Licence (RSL) broadcasts have been staged, including five weekend broadcasts staged in partnership with other organisations. Further to this, a number of community – wide initiatives have been organised in conjunction with local organisations to facilitate the involvement of 350 young people in community radio activity.
Vale FM underwent a rebranding in 2010 and is now known as 107.5 Switch Radio.

Vale Mail was first published in 2000 by CVHAT before being taken over by Headline Media Birmingham in 2004. The bi-monthly newspaper has 16 pages and is distributed to 8,800 residents in 4,100 households. In 2007, a survey conducted by Castle Vale Tenants and Residents Alliance showed that 84% of local residents relied on it as a source for local news.

== Community organisations ==
As Castle Vale Housing Action Trust was established to last a total of twelve years, the trust needed to find ways of maintaining their work after it was disestablished. A number of successor organisations were established throughout the HAT&#x27;s life to deal with individual aspects that the HAT covered. The first of these was the Castle Vale Community Housing Association (CVCHA), established in 1997. The Housing Association manages the homes that were developed by the HAT&#x27;s housing association partners. Now based at Reed Square, it manages around 2,500 homes and employs over 80 people, with a board of 14 members, the majority of which are Castle Vale residents. A landlord ballot in October 2003 found that 98% of residents wanted to be transferred to CVCHA following CVHAT&#x27;s disestablishment, with the remaining 2% returning to Birmingham City Council&#x27;s management.

Merlin Venture Ltd. was established in 1999 as a community development trust, focussing largely on employment and training. It is a not-for-profit company that owns numerous businesses that provides services for Castle Vale and beyond. It manages Tiggy Winkles Day Care Nursery, which was established in 1993 and is now based in two facilities on the estate. They also manage two transport businesses; Valley Travel and Buster Werkenbak. Valley Travel operates the 696 bus route, and Buster Werkenbak operates an on-demand transportation service for employees to travel to work in areas that are otherwise served with poor transportation services. Merlin Security originally operated CCTV cameras around the estate working with the Community Wardens employed by CVCHA to tackle problem areas this service was handed over the CVCHA to continue in 2011. Valescapes is a landscaping service for the estate that also offers employment opportunities for locals. To encourage job creation on the estate, Merlin Training provides training services in electrics, decorating and plumbing. Additionally, Merlin Recruitment offers residents services to assist them in getting jobs and liaising with businesses to publish vacancies. Merlin JETS is similar in that it offers advice to those looking for a new job. Merlin Venture is based at Venture House in Enterprise Park.

The Community Environmental Trust (CET) formally known as the Castle Vale Community Environmental Trust is an environmental organisation dedicated to protecting the environment, conserving urban green space, promoting sustainability and reducing CO2 emissions. The Trust was established in January 2000 and was originally designed as an umbrella organisation for several groups within Castle Vale. It was tasked with the common interest of the groups of protecting the urban green space and ensuring that the environment was not forgotten during the regeneration process.
Today the Trust is a stand-alone environmental body that delivers many projects across the estate of Castle Vale and beyond. Including projects like The Castle Vale Forest Schools project, Confidence through Conservation, Cycle-Vans and the Community Garden.

To ensure that the key partners in the regeneration of the estate remain in contact, the Castle Vale Neighbourhood Partnership was established in 2002. The Neighbourhood Partnership holds community meetings with representatives from the community organisations and trusts to assist in any concerns residents may have.

<text>Caliban are a German metalcore band from Essen. To date, they have released thirteen studio albums and two EPs, along with two split albums with Heaven Shall Burn.

==History==
Caliban was formed in Essen, Germany in 1997 as Never Again. In the beginning, the band consisted of vocalists Andreas Dörner and Marc Ulfig, guitarists Björn Kaiser and Marc Görtz, bassist Engin Güres and drummer Kai Kogelheide. With this lineup, a self-titled demo was recorded. After six months of playing together and several member changes – Ulfig, Kaiser and Kogelheide left, the latter were replaced by Claus Wilgenbusch and Robert Krämer – the band recorded two songs for a demo, which was never released. The songs were sent to several record labels, and Lifeforce Records was the first to offer the band – by then called Caliban – a record deal. Caliban&#x27;s first self-titled EP came out in the summer of 1998. To promote it, the band played many shows all over Europe and a few support shows for bands including Morning Again, Earth Crisis and Cro-Mags.

After their European tour in 1999, Caliban entered the studio to record their first full-length entitled &quot;A Small Boy and a Grey Heaven&quot;. The CD received favorable reviews in many big magazines and many smaller hardcore and metal zines. They also released the first part of a split-CD with Heaven Shall Burn, named &quot;The Split Program&quot;.

&quot;Vent&quot; came out in April 2001. &quot;Vent&quot; was released by Imperium Records and by Howling-Bull Records in Japan. Shortly after the release, Caliban was offered the opportunity to tour Japan to play the Beast-Feast 2001 in the Yokohama Arena, sharing stage with bands including Slayer, Pantera, Machine Head, Biohazard and Morbid Angel. The Japan trip was followed by a U.S. tour with Bloodjinn, which was interrupted by the September 11 attacks.

In August 2002, Caliban recorded their third official release &quot;Shadow Hearts&quot;. This record was more melodic and harmonic than its predecessors. In 2004 the band got a record deal with Roadrunner Records in Europe (Abacus Recordings in the US) and started to record their fourth album, &quot;The Opposite from Within&quot;, alongside producer Anders Fridén, who is known for fronting In Flames.

In July 2005, the band released the second part of their split-CD with their friends from Heaven Shall Burn, called &quot;The Split Program II&quot;. The band released their fifth album called &quot;The Undying Darkness&quot; in February 2006 and toured with All Shall Perish, Bleeding Through and I Killed the Prom Queen for the &quot;Darkness over Europe&quot; tour.

In 2007, Caliban recorded their album &quot;The Awakening&quot; with producer Benny Richter and it was released in Germany on 25 May. The album reached 36 in the German charts.

In 2009, the band toured with German band Kreator on the &quot;Chaos Over Europe Tour&quot;. They also signed a worldwide contract with Century Media Records. They released their new album, &quot;Say Hello to Tragedy&quot;, on 25 August 2009. This album - just like &quot;The Awakening&quot; - reached 36th place on the German media charts.
In October and November they toured Europe on the &quot;Beastfest European Tour 2009&quot; with Suicide Silence, German friend-band Maroon and American acts Emmure and After the Burial.

Caliban entered the studio in February and recorded a cover EP titled &quot;Coverfield&quot;, released in May 2011. The album consists of 4 songs, although more songs were recorded and may be released later. In mid August, the band entered the studio to finish writing and recording a new full-length album to be released in early 2012.

<text>Duddeston is an inner-city area of the Nechells ward of central Birmingham, England. It was part of the Birmingham Duddeston constituency until that ceased to exist in 1950.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Duddeston&quot; comes from &quot;Dud&#x27;s Town&quot;, with Dud being the Saxon proprietor, Lord of Dudley who probably had a seat in Duddeston.

==History==
Duddeston is first mentioned in a charter granted to Wulfget the Thane by Eadgar, King of the Angles in 963. There is no mention of Duddeston for another 200 years until it said that the Holte family were the residents of Duddeston Manor, a large house located next to the River Rea. This had been purchased by the family in 1365 by the family who also owned the manor of Nechells and were related to a prominent family in Erdington. Their wealth of land expanded two years later when the manor of Aston was bestowed upon them.

One hundred years later, Thomas Holte became the Chief Justice of Wales and a close friend of King Henry VIII. In 1546, Thomas died and Duddeston Hall was a sign of his wealth. His grandson, also called Thomas Holte, supplied a small army in defending Ireland and for this he was knighted. He commissioned the construction of Aston Hall soon after.

During the 18th century, many adverts for cock fighting at the hall appeared and in many, the name Vauxhall appeared. The first use of the name Vauxhall was in 1751 and was spelt Vaux Hall. It was referred to as another name for the hall. It is also known that the building had been refurbished, possibly rebuilt, to accommodate travellers. Large gardens had also been created and it became an attraction for the city. Travelling there was made easier with the opening of Duddeston and Vauxhall railway station. However, the owners of the hall ran into financial difficulty and the last celebrations in the gardens were held in September 1850, before the gardens were removed. Houses were built on site.

During the Priestly Riots of 1791, the military established Duddeston Barracks in the area. The barracks remained until 1932, when they were demolished by the Birmingham Corporation for the construction of maisonettes.

After sustaining heavy damage during World War II bombing raids, as a result of its close proximity to targets such as factories and gas works, the area was named as one of five regeneration areas of the city with of land in Duddeston and the adjoining Nechells prepared for redevelopment under the Housing Act of 1936. After World War II, the city council compulsorily purchased of land. This was the first redevelopment area proposed by Herbert Manzoni and was approved in 1950. The area was cleared and rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s, erasing the nineteenth century structures. Four tower blocks, the first to be built in the city, and collectively known as the Duddeston Four, the 12-storey High, Queens, Home and South Towers, were all completed between 1954 and 1955. The design by SN Cooke and Partners consists of a stretched X-shaped footprint, with brick cladding on a steel-frame. Porthole-shaped windows overlook grassed areas. The design was expensive and upon their completion, they were criticised by the council over their cost, despite receiving positive reviews from the &quot;&quot;Municipal Journal&quot; and &quot;Architectural Review&quot;&quot;. In the 1990s, the blocks were refurbished and a new security system was installed, while other multi-storey tower blocks in the area were demolished and replaced by low-rise housing, continuing the theme of low-rise housing in the area which began in the 1970s.

===Notable people===
*Samuel &quot;John&quot; Galton Jr. FRS, (1753–1832), was born in Duddeston.
* William Amey VC MM, (1881–1940), recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was born in Duddeston.
