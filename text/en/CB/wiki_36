<text>Consonant mutation is change in a consonant in a word according to its morphological or syntactic environment.

Mutation occurs in languages around the world. A prototypical example of consonant mutation is the initial consonant mutation of all modern Celtic languages. Initial consonant mutation is also found in Indonesian or Malay, in Nivkh, in Southern Paiute and in several West African languages such as Fula. The Nilotic language Dholuo, spoken in Kenya, shows mutation of stem-final consonants, as does English to a small extent. Mutation of initial, medial and final consonants is found in Modern Hebrew. Also, Japanese exhibits word medial consonant mutation involving voicing, &quot;rendaku&quot;, in many compounds. Uralic languages like Finnish show consonant gradation, a type of consonant mutation.

== Similar sound changes ==
Initial consonant mutation must not be confused with sandhi, which can refer to word-initial alternations triggered by their phonological environment, unlike mutations, which are triggered by their morphosyntactic environment. Some examples of word-initial sandhi are listed below.
*Spanish: , occurring after nasals and pause, alternate with , occurring after vowels and liquid consonants. Example: un [b]arco &#x27;a boat&#x27;, mi [β]arco &#x27;my boat&#x27;. This also occurs in Hebrew (as begedkefet, an acronym for the consonants this affects), Aramaic, and Tamil.
*Scottish Gaelic: in some dialects, stops in stressed syllables are voiced after nasals, e.g. cat &#x27;a cat&#x27;, an cat &#x27;the cat&#x27;.

Sandhi effects like these (or other phonological processes) are usually the historical origin of morphosyntactically triggered mutation. For example, English fricative mutation (specifically, voicing) in words such as &quot;house&quot; [haus], plural &quot;houses&quot; [hauzɪz], and the verb &quot;to house&quot; [hauz] originates in an allophonic alternation of Old English, where a voiced fricative occurred between vowels (or before voiced consonants), and a voiceless one occurred initially or finally, and also when adjacent to voiceless consonants. Old English infinitives ended in &quot;-(i)an&quot; and plural nouns (of Class One nouns) ended in &quot;-as&quot;. Thus, &quot;hūs&quot; &#x27;a house&#x27; had , and &quot;hūsian&quot; &#x27;house (verb)&#x27; had ; however, the plural of &quot;hūs&quot; was &quot;hūs&quot;, being a neuter noun of the strong a-stem class. During the Middle English period, &quot;hous&quot;~&quot;hus&quot;, as part of the loss of gender and erosion of endings, developed plural variation, retaining &quot;hous&quot; [hu:s], the dative plural &quot;housen&quot; [hu:zən], which became extended to a general plural, and over time taking on the &quot;es&quot; plural from Old English Class 1 nouns, thus &quot;houses&quot; [hu:zəz]. After most endings were lost in English, and the contrast between voiced and voiceless fricatives partly phonemicized (largely due to the influx of French loanwords), the alternation was morphologized.

== Examples ==

=== English ===

In Old English, velar stops were palatalized in certain cases but not others. That resulted in some alternations, many of which have been levelled, but traces occur in some word doublets such as &quot;ditch&quot; and &quot;dike&quot; .

In the past tense of certain verbs, English also retains traces of several ancient sound developments such as *kt &gt; *xt and *ŋx &gt; *x; many of them have been further complicated by the loss of in Middle English.
* &quot;seek&quot; : &quot;sought&quot; 
* &quot;think&quot; : &quot;thought&quot; 

The pair &quot;teach&quot; : &quot;taught&quot; has a combination of both this and palatalization.

A second palatalization, called yod-coalescence, occurs in loanwords from Latin. One subtype affects the sibilant consonants: earlier and were palatalized, leading to an alternation between alveolar and postalveolar .
* &quot;confess&quot; : &quot;confession&quot; 
* &quot;fuse&quot; : &quot;fusion&quot; 

Another unproductive layer results from the Vulgar Latin palatalization of velar stops before front vowels. It is thus imported from the Romance languages, and alternate with .
* &quot;induce&quot; : &quot;induction&quot; 
* &quot;magic&quot; : &quot;magus&quot; 

A combination of inherited and loaned alternation also occurs: an alternation pattern *t : *sj was brought over in Latinate loanwords, which in English was then turned into an alternation between and .
* &quot;act&quot; : &quot;action&quot; 

=== Celtic languages ===

The Insular Celtic languages are well-known for their initial consonant mutations. The individual languages vary on the number of mutations available: Scottish Gaelic has one, Irish and Manx have two, Welsh, Cornish and Breton have four (if mixed mutations are counted). Cornish and Breton have so-called mixed mutations; a trigger causes one mutation to some sounds and another to other sounds. Welsh also has a mixed mutation (triggered by &quot;na&quot;, &quot;ni&quot; and &quot;oni&quot;). The languages vary on the environments for the mutations, but some generalizations can be made. Those languages all have feminine singular nouns mutated after the definite article, with adjectives mutated after feminine singular nouns. In most of the languages, the possessive determiners trigger various mutations. Here are some examples from Breton, Cornish, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Welsh:

Older textbooks on Gaelic sometimes refer to the &quot;c → ch&quot; mutation as &quot;aspiration&quot;, but it is not aspiration in the sense of the word used by modern phoneticians, and linguists prefer to speak of lenition here.

Historically, the Celtic initial mutations originated from progressive assimilation and sandhi phenomena between adjacent words. For example, the mutating effect of the conjunction &quot;a&quot; &#x27;and&#x27; is from the word once having the form *ak, and the final consonant influenced the following sounds.

==== Welsh ==== 

Welsh has three main classes of initial consonant mutation: &quot;soft mutation&quot; (); &quot;nasal mutation&quot; (); and &quot;aspirate mutation&quot;, which is sometimes called &quot;spirant mutation&quot; (). The fourth category is &quot;mixed mutation&quot;, which calls for an &quot;aspirate mutation&quot; if possible but otherwise a &quot;soft mutation&quot;. The following tables show the range of Welsh mutations with examples. A blank cell indicates that no change occurs.

The mutation &quot;ts&quot; → &quot;j&quot; corresponds to the &quot;t&quot; → &quot;d&quot; mutation and reflects a change heard in modern words borrowed from English. Borrowed words like (chips) can often be heard in Wales. &#x27;I&#x27;m going to get (some) chips&#x27;; &#x27;I have chips&#x27;. However, the &quot;ts&quot; → &quot;j&quot; mutation is not usually included the classic list of Welsh mutations and is rarely taught in formal classes. Nevertheless, it is a part of the colloquial language and is used by native speakers.

===== &quot;h&quot;-prothesis =====
h-&quot;prothesis&quot; is a feature in Welsh in which a vowel-initial word becomes &quot;h&quot;-initial. It occurs after the possessive pronouns &#x27;her&#x27;, &#x27;our&#x27;, and &#x27;their&#x27;: &#x27;age&#x27;, &#x27;her age&#x27; (c.f. &#x27;his age&#x27;). It also occurs with &#x27;twenty&#x27; after &#x27;on&#x27; in the traditional counting system: &#x27;twenty-one&#x27;, literally &quot;one on twenty&quot;.

==== Irish ====

Irish has two consonant mutations: &quot;lenition&quot; ( ) and &quot;eclipsis&quot; ( ).

===== Lenition =====
Lenition () is indicated by an following the consonant in question or, in some older typefaces and texts, by a overdot () above the letter that has undergone lenition. The effects of lenition are as follows:

# A stop becomes a fricative. Voicing is retained, as is place of articulation except for the coronals.
#* → 
#* → 
#* → 
#* → 
#* → 
#* → 
#* → 
# and become , but , , , , , and do not mutate.
# and are deleted.

===== Eclipsis =====
The following tables show how eclipsis affects the start of words. Eclipsis is represented in the orthography by adding a letter, or occasionally two letters, to the start of the word. If the word is to be capitalised, the original first letter is capitalised, not the letter or letters added for eclipsis, e.g. the in , Ireland&#x27;s national anthem.

=== Russian ===
In Russian, consonant mutation and alternations are a very common phenomenon during word formation, conjugation and in comparative adjectives.

The most common classes of mutations are the alternation between velar and postalveolar consonants:
* → 
* → , as in &quot;quiet&quot; and &quot;quieter&quot;
*Gain or loss of palatalization: &quot;tsar&quot; and &quot;of the tsar&quot; (adjective)

Other common mutations are:
* → (or less frequently щ ), → 
* → : плеск → плещет &quot;splash&quot; / &quot;(he) splashes&quot;, → : свистеть → свищу &quot;to whistle&quot; / &quot;I whistle&quot;

=== Hebrew ===
Modern Hebrew shows a limited set of mutation alternations, involving spirantization only. The consonants affected may be stem-initial, stem-medial, or stem-final.

However, in Modern Hebrew, stop and fricative variants of , and are sometimes distinct phonemes:

For a more in depth discussion of this phenomenon, see Begadkefat.

=== Japanese ===
Rendaku, meaning &quot;sequential voicing&quot;, is a mutation of the initial consonant of a non-initial component in a Japanese compound word:
* nigiri + sushi → nigirizushi (&quot;grip (with the hand)&quot; + &quot;sushi&quot; → &quot;hand-shaped sushi&quot;)
* nigori + sake → nigorizake (&quot;muddy&quot; + &quot;rice wine&quot; → &quot;unfiltered sake&quot;)

=== Uralic languages ===

Word-medial consonant mutation is found in several Uralic languages and has the traditional name of consonant gradation. It is pervasive, especially in the Samic and Finnic branches.

==== Finnish ====

Consonant gradation involves an alternation in consonants between a strong grade in some forms of a word and a weak grade in others. The consonants subject to graduation are the plosives (, , ) that are followed by a vowel and preceded by a vowel, a sonorant (, , , ), or . The strong grade usually appears in an open syllable or before a long vowel.

The gradation of loanwords may include gradation of the plosives that are not native to Finnish:

=== Burmese ===
Burmese exhibits consonant mutation, involving voicing in many compound words.

The primary type of consonant mutation is that if two syllables are joined to form a compound word, the initial consonant of the second syllable becomes voiced. The shift occurs in these phones:
* → 
* → 
* → 

Examples:
: () + () &gt; (&quot;medicine&quot; + &quot;room&quot; → &quot;clinic&quot;)

The second type of consonant mutation occurs when the phoneme after the nasalized final becomes a sound in compound words.

Examples:
:&quot;blouse&quot; ( &quot;angkyi&quot;) can be pronounced or .

The third type of consonant mutation occurs when phonemes , after the nasalized final , become in compound words:

: () + () &gt; () (&quot;to consult&quot;)
: () + () &gt; (&quot;to apologize&quot;)
: () + () &gt; (&quot;airplane&quot;)

=== Southern Oceanic languages ===
Mutation of the initial consonant of verbs is a feature of several languages in the Southern Oceanic branch of the Austronesian language family.

==== Central Vanuatu ====
Initial consonant mutation occurs in many Central Vanuatu languages like Raga:

: &quot;nan vano&quot; &quot;I went&quot;
: &quot;nam bano&quot; &quot;I go&quot;

Those patterns of mutations probably arose when a nasal prefix, indicating the realis mood, became combined with the verb&#x27;s initial consonant. The possible ancestral pattern of mutation and its descendants in some modern Central Vanuatu languages are shown below:

==== New Caledonia ====
Initial consonant mutation also serves a grammatical purpose in some New Caledonian languages. For example, Iaai uses initial consonant mutation in verbs to distinguish between specific/definite objects and generic/indefinite objects:

Those forms likely derive from an earlier reduplication of the first syllable in which the interconsonantal vowel was deleted, resulting in a spirantization of the formerly reduplicated consonant.

=== Dholuo ===

The Dholuo language (one of the Luo languages) shows alternations between voiced and voiceless states of the final consonant of a noun stem. In the construct state (the form that means &#x27;hill of&#x27;, &#x27;stick of&#x27;, etc.) the voicing of the final consonant is switched from the absolute state. (There are also often vowel alternations that are independent of consonant mutation.)
* &#x27;hill&#x27; (abs.), god (const.)
* &#x27;stick&#x27; (abs.), luð (const.)
* &#x27;appearance&#x27; (abs.), kit (const.)
* &#x27;bone&#x27; (abs.), (const.)
*buk &#x27;book&#x27; (abs.), bug (const.)
* &#x27;book&#x27; (abs.), (const.)

=== Fula ===

Consonant mutation is a prominent feature of the Fula language. The Gombe dialect spoken in Nigeria, for example, shows mutation triggered by declension class. The mutation grades are fortition and prenasalization:

For example, the stems rim- &#x27;free man&#x27; and &#x27;person&#x27; have the following forms:
* (class 2), dimo (class 1), ndimon (class 6)
* (class 2), gimɗo (class 1), ŋgimkon (class 6)

=== Indonesian and Malay ===
The active form of a multisyllabic verb with an initial stop consonant or fricative consonant is formed by prefixing the verb stem with &quot;meN-&quot; in which &quot;N&quot; stands for a nasal sharing the same place of articulation as the initial consonant:

*garuk → menggaruk (= to scratch), hitung → menghitung (= to count),
*beri → memberi (= to give), fitnah → memfitnah (= to accuse falsely),
*cari → mencari (= to search), dapat → mendapat (= to obtain), *jangkau → menjangkau (= to reach)

An initial consonant that is an unvoiced stop or &quot;s&quot; is deleted, leaving only the nasal in its place.

*kandung → mengandung (= to contain or to be pregnant),
*putih → memutih (= to turn white),
*satu → menyatu (= to become one / to unite),
*tulis → menulis (= to write).

Applied to verbs starting with a vowel, the nasal is realized as &quot;ng&quot; .

Monosyllabic verbs add an epenthetic vowel before prefixing and produce the prefix &quot;menge-&quot;:

*bor (= boring tool / drill) → mengebor (= to make a hole with drill).

Verbs starting with a nasal or approximant consonant do not add any mutant nasal, only &quot;me-&quot;.

The colloquial language (especially Jakartan Indonesian) drops &quot;me-&quot; prefix but tends to replace it with nasalization in some consonants:

*tanya → menanya → nanya
*pikir → memikir → mikir
*merepotkan → ng(e)repotin

=== Latvian ===
More information is available in the Latvian Wikipedia.

Also two consonants can mutate as a group.

=== Ute ===
In Ute, also called Southern Paiute, there are three consonant mutations, which are triggered by different word-stems, The mutations are spirantization, gemination, and prenasalization:

For example, the absolutive suffix -pi appears in different forms, according to the noun stem to which it is suffixed:
*movi-ppi &#x27;nose&#x27;
*sappI-vi &#x27;belly&#x27;
*-mpi &#x27;tongue&#x27;

<doc id="810260" wikidata="Q6467294" url="?curid=810260" title="Laboratory for Laser Energetics">
<text>The Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) is a scientific research facility which is part of the University of Rochester&#x27;s south campus, located in Brighton, New York. The lab was established in 1970 with operations jointly funded by the United States Department of Energy, the University of Rochester and the New York State government. The Laser Lab was commissioned to investigate high-energy physics involving the interaction of extremely intense laser radiation with matter. Scientific experiments at the facility emphasize inertial confinement, direct drive, laser-induced fusion, fundamental plasma physics and astrophysics using the OMEGA Laser Facility. In June 1995, OMEGA became the world&#x27;s highest-energy ultraviolet laser. The lab shares its building with the Center for Optoelectronics and Imaging and the Center for Optics Manufacturing. The Robert L. Sproull Center for Ultra High Intensity Laser Research was opened in 2005 and houses the OMEGA EP laser, which was completed in May 2008.

More than 270 Ph.D.s have been awarded for research conducted at the LLE. During summer months the lab sponsors local-area high school juniors in research at the laboratory, with most of their projects led by senior scientists at the lab.

==History==
The LLE was founded on the University of Rochester&#x27;s campus in 1970, by Dr. Moshe Lubin. Working with outside companies such as Kodak the team built Delta, a four beam laser system in 1972. Construction started on the current LLE site in 1976. The facility opened a six beam laser system in 1978 and followed with a 24 beam system two years later. In 2018, Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou shared a Nobel prize for work they had undertaken in 1985 while at LLE. They invented a method to amplify laser pulses by &quot;chirping&quot; for which they would share the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics. This method disperses a short, broadband pulse of laser light into a temporally longer spectrum of wavelengths. The system amplifies the laser at each wavelength and then reconstitutes the beam into one color. Chirp pulsed amplification became instrumental in building the National Ignition Facility and the OMEGA EP system. In 1995, the OMEGA Laser system was increased to 60 beams, and in 2008 the OMEGA Extended Performance (OMEGA EP) system was opened.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; and Scientific American provided simplified summaries of the work of Strickland and Mourou: it &quot;paved the way for the shortest, most intense laser beams ever created&quot;. &quot;The ultrabrief, ultrasharp beams can be used to make extremely precise cuts so their technique is now used in laser machining and enables doctors to perform millions of corrective&quot; laser eye surgeries.

==OMEGA laser==
The OMEGA laser is a laser device at the LLE built to perform direct-drive inertial confinement fusion experiments. It is a 60-beam ultraviolet frequency-tripled neodymium glass laser, which is capable of delivering 40 kilojoules at up to 60 terawatts, making it one of the most powerful and highest energy lasers in the world. The laser light can be focused onto a spherical target less than 1 millimeter in diameter suspended in a spherical vacuum chamber 3.3 meters in diameter.

Initial construction and commissioning of the laser were completed in 1980 under a 21 million USD contract between the University of Rochester and the US Department of Energy. At the time, it was a 24-beam 15 terawatt system. It was upgraded between 1990 and 1995 for 61 million USD into the 60-beam system that exists today. OMEGA held the record for highest energy laser (per pulse) from 1999 (after the Nova laser&#x27;s dismantling) to 2005, when the first 8 beams of the National Ignition Facility exceeded OMEGA&#x27;s output by about 30 kJ in the ultraviolet.

OMEGA is used for direct-drive inertial confinement fusion experiments, in which the lasers compress a target filled with fusion fuel, forming a dense hot region at the center in which nuclear fusion reactions occur. OMEGA once held the record for highest neutron yield of any inertial confinement fusion device. It has demonstrated yields of over 5×1013 reactions per implosion, with internal pressures of over 50 gigabars.

==OMEGA EP laser==
The OMEGA EP (extended performance) laser system is an independently operable laser device and extension to OMEGA dedicated on May 16, 2008 with the purpose of studying advanced ignition techniques.
It hosts four NIF-like laser beams, each capable of delivering up to 1.6 kilojoules of energy, as well as a new target chamber. Two of the beams possess pulse compression gratings allowing for pulses as short as 1 picosecond.
The laser is housed inside a 2005 building addition.

While OMEGA EP normally operates separately from OMEGA, its two short-pulse beams can also be combined and directed into the OMEGA target chamber, in addition to OMEGA&#x27;s 60 existing beams. The high power of these beams combined with their ability to be independently timed enables integrated fast-ignition experiments, in which the OMEGA laser compresses a spherical target full of fusion fuel and then OMEGA EP drives a beam of electrons into its center, kick-starting thermonuclear burn. The combination of the OMEGA and the OMEGA EP laser systems makes LLE the world&#x27;s only fully integrated cryogenic fast ignition experimental facility.

== Organization ==

LLE is located at, and operated by the University of Rochester. OMEGA and OMEGA EP are user facilities, open for use by the entire scientific community.

LLE&#x27;s principal sponsor is the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) Office of Defense Programs , which supports its stockpile stewardship and advanced scientific computing programs.

The Laboratory has a five-fold mission:
* To conduct implosion experiments and basic physics experiments in support of the National Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) program.
* To develop new laser and materials technologies.
* To provide graduate and undergraduate education in electro-optics, high-power lasers, high-energy-density physics, plasma physics, and nuclear fusion technology.
* To operate the National Laser Users&#x27; Facility.
* To conduct research and development in advanced technology related to high-energy-density phenomena.

<doc id="810266" wikidata="Q3473576" url="?curid=810266" title="Bonito">
<text>Bonitos are a tribe of medium-sized, ray-finned predatory fish in the family Scombridae – a family it shares with the mackerel, tuna, and Spanish mackerel tribes, and also the butterfly kingfish. Also called the tribe Sardini, it consists of eight species across four genera; three of those four genera are monotypic, having a single species each. Bonitos closely resemble the skipjack tuna, which is often called a bonito, especially in Japanese contexts.

== Etymology ==
The fish&#x27;s name comes from the Portuguese and Spanish &quot;bonito&quot; (there&#x27;s no evidence of the origin of the name), identical to the adjective meaning &#x27;pretty&#x27;. However, the noun referring to the fish seems to come from the low and medieval Latin form &quot;boniton&quot;, a word with a strange structure and an obscure origin, related to the word &quot;byza&quot;, a possible borrowing from the Greek βῦζα, &#x27;owl&#x27;.

== Species ==
* Genus &quot;Sarda&quot; 
** Australian bonito, &quot;S. australis&quot; 
** &quot;Sarda chiliensis&quot; 
** Eastern Pacific bonito, &quot;S. c. chiliensis&quot; 
** Pacific bonito, &quot;S. c. lineolata&quot; 
** Striped bonito, &quot;S. orientalis&quot; 
** Atlantic bonito, &quot;S. sarda&quot; 
* Genus &quot;Cybiosarda&quot; 
** Leaping bonito, &quot;C. elegans&quot; 
* Genus &quot;Gymnosarda&quot; 
** Dogtooth tuna, &quot;G. unicolor&quot; 
* Genus &quot;Orcynopsis&quot; 
** Plain bonito, &quot;O. unicolor&quot; 

== As food==
Pacific and Atlantic bonito meat has a firm texture and a darkish color, as well as a moderate fat content. The meat of young or small bonito can be of light color, close to that of skipjack tuna, and is sometimes used as a cheap substitute for skipjack, especially for canning purposes, and occasionally in the production of cheap varieties of katsuobushi that are sold as &quot;bonito flakes&quot;. Bonito may not, however, be marketed as tuna in all countries. The Atlantic bonito is also found in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, where it is a popular food fish, eaten grilled, pickled (&quot;lakerda&quot;), or baked.

<text>The rufous-tailed jacamar (Galbula ruficauda) is a near passerine bird which breeds in the tropical New World in southern Mexico, Central America and South America as far south as southern Brazil and Ecuador.

==Description==

Like other jacamars they are elegant, brightly coloured birds with long bills and tails. The rufous-tailed jacamar is typically long with a long black bill. The subspecies &quot;G. r. brevirostris&quot; has, as its name implies, a shorter bill. This bird is metallic green above, and the underparts are mainly orange, including the undertail, but there is a green breast band. Sexes differ in that the male has a white throat, and the female a buff throat; she also tends to have paler underparts. The race &quot;G. r. pallens&quot; has a copper-coloured back in both sexes.

==Food and foraging==

This insectivore hunts from a perch, sitting with its bill tilted up, then flying out to catch flying insects. One commonly preyed upon insect is the social wasp &quot;Agelaia vicina&quot;. Other insect prey include flies, beetles, bees, dragonflies, and butterflies. Further, the bird distinguishes between edible and unpalatable butterflies mainly according to body shape.

==Nesting==
This species is a resident breeder in a range of dry or moist woodlands and scrub. The two to four rufous-spotted white eggs are laid in a burrow in a bank or termite mound.

==Vocalizations==
The rufous-tailed jacamar&#x27;s call is a sharp &#x27;, and the song a high thin &#x27;, ending in a trill.

<doc id="810271" wikidata="Q3065876" url="?curid=810271" title="Red Bull Theatre">
<text>The Red Bull Theatre was an inn-yard conversion erected in Clerkenwell, London, operating in the 17th century. For more than forty years, it entertained audiences drawn primarily from the City and its suburbs, developing a reputation over the years for rowdiness. After Parliament closed the theatres in 1642, it continued to host illegal performances intermittently, and when the theatres reopened after the Restoration, it became a legitimate venue again. There is a myth that it burned down in the Great Fire of London but the direct reason for its end is unclear.

==Design==
The Red Bull was constructed in about 1605 on St John Street in Clerkenwell on a site corresponding to the eastern end of modern-day Hayward&#x27;s Place. Contemporary documents reveal that it was converted from a yard in an inn. This origin accounts for its square-ish shape, shared, for example, by the original Fortune Theatre among playhouses of the time. The Red Bull inn&#x27;s name may relate to drovers bringing cattle down St John Street toward the markets at Smithfield. The conversion was undertaken by Aaron Holland, owner of the inn from 1602, on land he (along with an actor named Martin Slatier or Slater) had leased from Anne Bedingfeild, the inheritrix of a wealthy local brewer. Evidence indicates that its size was comparable to Globe Theatre and Fortune, its competitors. W. J. Lawrence argued that the theatre was roofed over in the early 1620s, but this idea was largely refuted by Leslie Hotson and G. E. Bentley. The Red Bull was most likely similar to the other outdoor theatres against which it competed, with an uncurtained thrust-forward stage backed by a tiring house and balcony, surrounded by standing room, and overlooked by galleries on three walls. It may well have held more than the capacity of The Globe.

==History==
===Jacobean and Caroline===
With the abatement of the plague epidemic in 1604, entrepreneur Aaron Holland (in the service of Earl of Devonshire) secured a lease on the Red Bull inn for conversion to a theatre. At the end of that year he agreed with the actor Martin Slatier to form a new company of players, and secured the essential aristocratic patronage from Ulrik, Duke of Holstein, younger brother to Queen Anne. (Perhaps because they had learned from Philip Henslowe&#x27;s recent problems with neighbourhood opposition in building the Fortune, they did not approach the court for approval until they had already placated their parish neighbours—as Henslowe had—by contributing to poor relief.) Thus, the royal patent was in the name Queen Anne&#x27;s Men. In addition to Martin Slatier, Thomas Swinnerton and Christopher Beeston were known to have owned shares in the enterprise. The company&#x27;s clown was to be Thomas Greene. The Queen Anne&#x27;s Men&#x27;s repertoire included works by prominent playwrights: Thomas Heywood, an actor in the company, contributed the greatest part. John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The White Devil&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Law-case&quot;, Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;If This Be Not A Good Play, the Devil Is in It&quot;, and John Cooke&#x27;s well-known &quot;The City Gallant&quot; (Thomas Greene&#x27;s &quot;Tu Quoque&quot;) were also included. They came into possession also of some older plays, including Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot;. The audience appears to have disapproved of &quot;The White Devil&quot; in 1611, and in later years the Red Bull as the cause of, or scene of, noted riots which are recorded in court cases.

In 1616, the Queen&#x27;s men, now directed by impresario Christopher Beeston, moved into Beeston&#x27;s new indoor Cockpit Theatre. This was in emulation of the King&#x27;s Men&#x27;s acquirement of the Blackfriars, the company now having both the outdoor Red Bull and the Indoor Cockpit. On Shrove Tuesday 1617, a mob of apprentices attacked the Cockpit but the theatre was re-established and was a successful venue into the Restoration. The first company was succeeded at the Red Bull by Prince Charles&#x27;s Men. The disintegration of Queen Anna&#x27;s men after Anne&#x27;s death in 1619 produced a little-understood reshuffling of these companies. In the decline of the Jacobean period, this company produced plays including Dekker and Massinger&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Martyr&quot;, Thomas May&#x27;s &quot;The Heir&quot;, and Gervase Markham and William Sampson&#x27;s &quot;Herod and Antipater&quot;.

After James&#x27;s death, Charles assumed patronage of the King&#x27;s Men, and the former Prince Charles&#x27;s Men disbanded. From this date, an even less reputable company took up residence at the Red Bull. Scholars generally call this troupe the Red Bull company, as the actors called themselves when in London; when touring, as they did frequently, they styled themselves the King&#x27;s Players. In 1627, Henry Herbert, acting on a request from John Heminges, ordered this company to cease performing Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. In November 1629, the theatre hosted visiting French actors who had earlier played at the Fortune and Blackfriars Theatre; a contemporary reference may indicate that this troupe, which included women, was poorly received in Clerkenwell.

By 1634, the Red Bull housed a new company patronized by the child Prince Charles II. By this point, the Red Bull&#x27;s reputation was tarnished. But the new company boasted a popular comedian, Andrew Cane, and it was able to survive the Privy Council&#x27;s anger over the slanderous play &quot;The Whore New Vamped&quot;, which mocked an alderman by name and complained of recently levied taxes.

===After 1642===
Along with all the other theatres in London, the Red Bull was closed for plays in 1642 by the Commonwealth. In the short term, the prohibition was of limited effect; as late as 1648, the Red Bull hosted a performance of Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Wit Without Money&quot;; advertisements for the performance were thrown into gentlemen&#x27;s carriages. There followed a crackdown on performances by Parliament, which grew wiser to the real implications of advertisements for &quot;rope dancing&quot; and other entertainments at the old theatres. On 20 December 1649, the Red Bull was successfully raided, a number of actors arrested and imprisoned, and their clothes and properties confiscated.

The Red Bull is the only theatre incontestably associated with drolls, brief farces taken from the most popular older plays. In 1653, Robert Cox was arrested at the Red Bull for a performance which crossed the line and was deemed a play. Sir William Davenant and Sir George Fletcher reportedly watched a play at the Red Bull in February or March 1655. In September 1655, the Red Bull was raided again as part of the same sterner attitude that led Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers to deface the Fortune and Blackfriars, and actors were arrested for performing there in 1659.

A collection of drolls was published by Francis Kirkman, some attributed to &quot;the incomparable Robert Cox&quot;, as &quot;The Wits&quot; (1662, and enlarged 1672–73). Kirkman said many had been performed at the Red Bull; however, the frontispiece to his volume does not necessarily represent a performance at the venue, as was once assumed—the drawing shows footlights and a candelabra, whereas the Red Bull mounted only open-air, daylight performances.

The theatre was re-opened in 1660 upon the Restoration of the monarchy, as home for Michael Mohun&#x27;s company and George Jolly&#x27;s troupe. Its new management returned to the business of staging crowd-pleasing drama; on 23 March 1661 Samuel Pepys recorded seeing a revival of William Rowley&#x27;s &quot;All&#x27;s Lost by Lust&quot; there, but he notes that the work was &quot;poorly done, with…much disorder&quot;. By the following year the building was given over to prize fights and public demonstrations of fencing. The Red Bull came to an end around 1665 or 1666, but this had nothing to do with the Great Fire of London, which stopped some distance south.

Buildings were constructed on the site of the playhouse, and the outline of its structure, including the passageway from the auditorium to St John Street, can still be traced at its location off Woodbridge Street.

==Legacy==
Founded in 2003, Red Bull Theater of New York City takes its name and inspiration from the original Red Bull.

<text>The National Patriotic Front &quot;Memory&quot; (NPF &quot;Memory&quot;; , also known as the Pamyat Society; , , ) was a Russian far-right antisemitic, and monarchist organization.

&quot;Pamyat&quot; also identified itself as the &quot;People&#x27;s National-Patriotic Orthodox Christian movement.&quot; The group&#x27;s stated focus is preserving Russian culture. Its longtime leader, Dmitri Vasilyev, died in 2003. The group had disappeared by the 1990s and split into groups like Russian National Unity.

==History==

At the end of the 1970s, the amateur historical and cultural association &quot;Vityaz&quot; (, &quot;Knight&quot;) was established by public activists from the Moscow branch of the Society for the Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments. One of the purposes of the newly formed association was to prepare for the upcoming celebration of the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kulikovo.
Some notable &quot;Vityaz&quot; activists in Moscow were Ilya Glazunov and V. Kuznetsov (artists), S. Malyshev (historian), A. Lebedev and A. Lobzov (Colonels of the MVD), G. Frygin (Minaviaprom engineer), Vyacheslav and Yevgeny Popov (musicians), and K. Andreyev (locksmith). Similar groups were created in other regions of the Soviet Union.

&quot;Vityaz&quot; and some other informal groups founded &quot;Pamyat&quot; as a public organization in Moscow in 1980. &quot;Pamyat&quot; took its name from the famous essay novel of the same name by Vladimir Chivilikhin.

Paul Klebnikov, in his book &quot;The Godfather of the Kremlin, Boris Berezovsky, or the Story of the Plundering of Russia&quot;, refers to Oleg Kalugin and writes that &quot;the nationalist group &quot;Pamyat&quot;… was formed with the help of the KGB.&quot;

At an internal meeting on October 4, 1985, &quot;Pamyat&quot; split into several factions, many of which attempted to retain the same name as the &quot;true&quot; &quot;Pamyat&quot;. One of them, the so-called &quot;Vasilyev&#x27;s group&quot;, led by Dmitri Vasilyev (a former worker in Glazunov&#x27;s studio), A. Andreyev, and A. Gladkov, focused its activities on the media.

By the end of 1986, &quot;Pamyat&quot;&#x27;s leaders claimed to be the main ideologues of the emerging Russian nationalist movement.

On May 6, 1987, &quot;Pamyat&quot; activists conducted an unregistered and illegal demonstration on Manezhnaya Square in Moscow in support of perestroika and to demand the end to the construction of an officially sanctioned memorial project at Poklonnaya Hill. The event met little repression from the authorities, and the participants met with Boris Yeltsin, then First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU, who listened to them attentively and promised to take into account their wishes.

In 1986–1987, other organizations named &quot;Pamyat&quot; were formed in cities in the RSFSR. The growth of &quot;Memory&quot;&#x27;s ranks was accompanied by numerous conflicts between its founders and leaders.

In the fall of 1987, the National-Patriotic Front (NPF) was founded with the aim of &quot;renaissance&quot;, with the intent to &quot;lead Russian people to the spiritual and national revival&quot; based on &quot;three traditional Russian values&quot;: Orthodoxy, national character and spirituality.

In 1987–1989, &quot;Pamyat&quot; was split into several groups, which had in common only a belief in the existence of a worldwide &quot;Zionomasonic conspiracy&quot; and the &quot;Pamyat&quot; name. By the early 1990s, several organizations bore this name, including:
* National Patriotic Front &quot;Pamyat&quot; (Dmitry Vasilyev)
* National Patriotic Front &quot;Pamyat&quot; (Nikolai Filimonov - I. Kvartalov)
* Orthodox National Patriotic Front &quot;Pamyat&quot; (A Kulakov - Sergei Vorotyntsev)
* Russian People&#x27;s Democratic Front - Movement &quot;Pamyat&quot; (Igor Sychev)
* Union for National Proportional Representation &quot;Pamyat&quot; (Konstantin Smirnov-Ostashvili)
* World Anti-Zionist and Anti-Masonic Front &quot;Pamyat&quot; (Valery Yemelyanov)
* Coordinating Council of the Patriotic Movement &quot;Pamyat&quot; (brothers Vyacheslav and Yevgeny Popov)
* Russian Assembly &quot;Pamyat&quot; (Igor Shcheglov)
After several splits and the imminent dissolution of the Soviet Union, the organization adopted a monarchist position.

In August 1990, a permanent NPF council member, Aleksandr Barkashov (the author of &quot;The ABC of a Russian Nationalist&quot;), caused another split after he announced being &quot;tired to be preoccupied by recollections&quot;. He said that &quot;it is time to act&quot;. His new group was dubbed &quot;Russian National Unity&quot; (Русское Национальное Единство). Barkashov promoted the veneration of the swastika.

In addition, in 1990, the following broke away from Dmitry Vasilyev&#x27;s NPF &quot;Pamyat&quot;:
* National Republican Party of Russia (Nikolai Lysenko)
* National Social Union (Viktor Yakushev)

According to writer Valery Shambarov, the plurality of &quot;Pamyat&quot; organizations was organized by the 5th Directorate (ideological) of the KGB of the USSR with the involvement of the CPSU MGK in order to discredit the organization of Dmitry Vasilyev.

In 1991, the organization&#x27;s newspaper (print run of 100,000) and radio station (both officially registered) were launched.

By the late 1990s, the original &quot;Pamyat&quot; disappeared from the public scene. Dmitry Vasilyev died on July 17, 2003. The organization reactivated in 2005 and participated in the Russian marches.

On September 1, 2021, it became known about the death of Nikolai Skorodumov: according to a post by Vladimir Basmanov on the Vkontakte social network, Nikolai Skorodumov died on June 10, 2021, at the age of 70 in a Zelenograd hospital

==Ideology==
The recurring motive in the group&#x27;s ideology was the claim of the existence of a so-called &quot;Ziono-Masonic plot&quot; against Russia as &quot;the main source of the misfortunes of Russian people, disintegration of the economy, denationalization of Russian culture, alcoholism, ecological crisis&quot; (according to &quot;Pamyat&quot;). The Zionists were also blamed for the triggering of the revolutions in 1905 and 1917, the death of millions in the course of the Russian Civil War and for Joseph Stalin&#x27;s personality cult. The contemporary Soviet government apparatus was alleged to be infiltrated by &quot;Zionists and freemasons&quot; working as &quot;agents of Zionism&quot; and serving the purpose of subordinating the Soviet government to the &quot;Jewish capital&quot;. The &quot;Zionist Occupation Government&quot; accusation was often used by &quot;Pamyat&quot;.

In 1993, a District Court in Moscow formally ruled that &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; were a fake, and dismissed a libel suit by &quot;Pamyat&quot;. The organization was criticized for using the document in their publications.

The group disappeared by the 1990s and was split into other groups like The National Patriotic Front and The Russian National Unity.

==Quotes==

From the open letter of the NPF &quot;Pamyat&quot; leader D. Vasilyev to the President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin:
: &quot;... Your Jewish entourage... have already made good use of you and don&#x27;t need you anymore. You will share the destiny of Napoleon, Hitler, etc. who were Zionist-maintained dictators... The aim of international Zionism is to seize power worldwide. For this reason Zionists struggle against national and religious traditions of other nations, and for this purpose they devised the Freemasonic concept of cosmopolitanism.&quot;

From the open letter of the NPF &quot;Pamyat&quot; leader D. Vasilyev to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin:
:&quot;Mr. President, your initiative to make taxes lower meets our demands. It is a positive step. Unfortunately, modern economy is an economy of national minority, which oppresses the majority. They are real suckers of our money, mineral resources etc. 
:Banks should not sell money and make it some kind of tradable good. They should serve the production sphere of economy. We are against a multiparty political system. Many parties mean distribution of egoism, blackmail etc. Russia has its own history, which is 1000 years old. It makes no sense to copy the western institutions in toto. They might be positive and efficient in small European countries, but in such a big country like Russia a weak, corrupted parliamentarian system means anarchy and fosters economic and politic separatism.&quot;

<text>Earl Wilbur Sutherland Jr. (November 19, 1915 – March 9, 1974) was an American pharmacologist and biochemist born in Burlingame, Kansas. Sutherland won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971 &quot;for his discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the action of hormones&quot;, especially epinephrine, via second messengers, namely cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cyclic AMP.

==Early life and education==
Sutherland was born on November 19, 1915, in Burlingame, Kansas. The second youngest of six children, he was raised by his mother, Edith M. Hartshorn, and his father, Earl W. Sutherland. Though his father, who was originally from Wisconsin, had attended Grinnell College for two years, he ultimately led an agrarian lifestyle that took him to both New Mexico and Oklahoma before settling down in Burlingame to raise a family. Edith, a Missouri native, had some training in nursing at what was called a &quot;ladies college&quot;. To provide for the family, Sutherland&#x27;s father ran a dry goods store, where he gave each of his children working jobs. Sutherland began fishing at the age of five, and this became a pastime that he enjoyed for most of his life.

As a high school student, Sutherland played and excelled in several sports, including tennis, basketball, and football.

In 1933, at the age of 17, Sutherland enrolled in Washburn College in Topeka, Kansas and began the pursuit of a Bachelor of Science degree. In order to pay for tuition, he worked throughout his undergraduate years as a medical staff assistant at a local hospital. Sutherland graduated in 1937, at the age of 21. He was then accepted to Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, where he developed a strong mentorship with Carl Ferdinand Cori. In 1942, Sutherland graduated with a Doctor of Medicine.

==Career==
===Academia and research===
In 1940, while studying at the Washington University School of Medicine, Sutherland had his first encounter with research as an assistant in pharmacology in the laboratory of Carl Ferdinand Cori, who won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 for his discovery of the mechanism of glycogen metabolism. Under Cori&#x27;s guidance, Sutherland conducted research on the effects of the hormones epinephrine and glucagon on the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. In 1942, he worked as an intern at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.

After receiving his medical degree from Washington University in 1942, Sutherland served as a World War II army physician. He returned to Washington University in St. Louis in 1945, where he continued to do research in Cori&#x27;s Laboratory. Sutherland accredits his decision to pursue a research career, as opposed to entering the medical profession, to his mentor Cori.

Sutherland held various teaching titles during his time at the Washington University School of Medicine, including instructor in pharmacology (1945–46), instructor in biochemistry (1946–50), assistant professor in biochemistry (1950–52), and associate professor in biochemistry (1952–53).

In 1953, Sutherland moved to Cleveland a position as a professor of pharmacology and chairman of the department of pharmacology at the school of medicine at Case Western Reserve University. There, he collaborated with Theodore W. Rall, also a professor of pharmacology, who was to become a lifelong research partner. Together, they conducted further research on the mechanism of hormone action at the molecular level. During his ten years at Case Western Reserve University, Sutherland made several ground-breaking discoveries that led to the identification of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cyclic AMP, and its role as a secondary messenger.

In 1963, Sutherland became professor of anatomy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. His position allowed him to devote more time to his research. He continued his work on cyclic AMP, receiving financial support from the Career Investigatorship awarded to him by the American Heart Association in 1967. He held his teaching title at Vanderbilt University until 1973.

In 1973, after spending 10 years at Vanderbilt University, Sutherland moved to Miami, where he joined the faculty at Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami as a distinguished professor of biochemistry. He continued to be involved in novel research about adenosine monophosphate and guanosine monophosphate, co-authoring four papers in 1973 alone.

===Discovery of cyclic AMP===
While working in Cori&#x27;s laboratory, Sutherland, with the help of his co-workers, made several discoveries concerning the mechanism of glycogen metabolism that, years later, led him to his discovery of the biological activity of cyclic AMP. Cori&#x27;s laboratory had previously established the basic mechanism of glycogen metabolism, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Sutherland helped to identify the importance of liver phosphorylase (LP) in the process of glycogenolysis. Of the three basic enzymes involved in glycogenolysis, he found that LP was rate-limiting, meaning that the progression of glycogen metabolism is dependent on this enzyme. LP would become the subject of his research for the next several years, and it was through experimentation on LP and hormone interaction that his most renowned discovery was made.

After identifying the importance of LP, Sutherland moved his research efforts to Western Reserve University. There, he worked in collaboration with Ted Rall, Walter D Wosilait, and Jacques Berthet to publish a series of papers in the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot;, &quot;The Relationship of Epinephrine and Glucagon to Liver Phosphorylase&quot;, which was released in four parts. These four papers document the purification of LP and the analysis of several of its properties. First, it was determined that the enzymatic activity of LP depends on the addition or removal of a phosphate group, a process called phosphorylation. In a later experiment, they demonstrated that more phosphate is taken up in liver slices when epinephrine and glucagon are added, suggesting that these hormones were promoting the phosphorylation of LP, activating the enzyme. The results of a later paper in the series suggested that this phosphorylation and activation of LP was a result of the action of phosphorlyase kinase. This series also investigated the inactivation of liver phosphorylase and characterized an enzyme they initially called LP-inactivating enzyme, which functions by cleaving the phosphate group. This enzyme was later renamed liver phosphorylase phosphatase. These papers also characterized LP in terms of molecular weight and other factors. During their analysis, they found the unexpected result that LP activation increased with the addition of 5-AMP, which is a precursor of cAMP; however, this was not known at the time.

The fourth paper published in this series, &quot;The Relationship of Epinephrine and Glucagon to Liver Phosphorylase: IV Effect of Epinephrine and Glucagon on the Reactivation of Phosphorylase in Liver Homogenates&quot;, was published in 1956. In this paper, Sutherland and associates furthered their investigation of epinephrine and glucagon. The key to the success of this experiment was the use a homogenate of liver cells rather than intact liver cells, as they had been doing in their previous experiments. The general consensus among researchers at that time was that the study of hormones was only possible using intact cells; this was the first instance that a hormone pathway was studied using a cell homogenate. Sutherland and his co-authors were able to observe similar effects in liver homogenate to what was observed in whole liver slices. More importantly, they were able to observe this response in two stages. This stage response was characterized by the particulate fraction producing an unknown heat stable factor in the presence of the hormones epinephrine and glucagon. This factor then stimulates the formation of liver phosphorylase in a fraction of the homogenate where the hormones are not present. This unknown heat stable factor, which was produced in the presence of hormones and ultimately led to the secondary formation of liver phosphorylase, was later termed cyclic AMP.

Even though the discovery of cyclic AMP and the idea of second messengers were of great importance to the world of medicine, Sutherland&#x27;s findings were actually achieved through strenuous trial and error. First of all, Sutherland and Ted Rall were convinced that a sucrose homogenate of liver cells was absolutely necessary in order to keep their cells healthy and proliferating. This inference was made by Rall from his experience studying mitochondria, which responded well to these sucrose homogenates; however, it had nothing to do with what was being studied at the time. It turned out that this sucrose was not necessary for the homogenate and once they set up the experiment without sucrose they were able to see more effective results. Secondly, Sutherland initially believed that there was something vital about the intact cell, and that disrupting its structure would not produce any hormonal effect. However, after some debate, Rall had convinced Sutherland to use liver homogenates. Once they had witnessed nearly a doubling of the rate of LP activation, they knew this belief in that keeping cells intact was crucial to studying the effects of hormones was not necessarily true, at least in this case. Finally, Sutherland had decided to ignore Jacques Berthet&#x27;s request to conduct the same experiment using proper lab technique, specifically the Lehninger Hard Pour, where the supernatant material was decanted by pouring the liquid into another test tube once the particulate fraction reached the top of the original tube. Berthet not only demanded this step of the procedure be done through careful aspiration, he also critiqued the lack of specificity during centrifugation with respect to suspension height, rpm and time. The willingness of Sutherland and his associates to modify their experimental procedures and mistaken assumptions allowed them to make the discoveries that they made.

==Personal life==
Sutherland married Mildred Rice in 1937, the same year that he graduated from Washburn College. In 1944, during World War II, Sutherland was called into service as a battalion surgeon under General George S. Patton, and was later sent to Germany, where he served as a staff physician in a military hospital until 1945. He had two sons and a daughter with Mildred Rice.

In 1962, Sutherland divorced his first wife. A year later, when he became professor of physiology at Vanderbilt University, Sutherland married Claudia Sebeste Smith, the assistant dean at the university, and they were together for the remainder of Sutherland&#x27;s life.

In 1952, Sutherland was awarded the Banting Memorial Lectureship and, in 1953, was elected as the Chairman of the Case Western Reserve University Department of Pharmacology in Cleveland, Ohio. He was awarded the Career Investigator position at the American Heart Association in 1967 and was elected as member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1973.

Sutherland was also a member of various scientific societies which included the American Society of Biological Chemists, the American Chemical Society, the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Sigma Xi.
From 1951 to 1956, Sutherland was a member of the editorial board for the Biochemical Preparations Journal. The editorial board of the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics sought is attention from 1957 to 1958.

==Death==
On March 9, 1974, Sutherland died of internal bleeding due to surgical complications following a massive esophageal hemorrhage. He was 58 years old.

==Legacy==
After Sutherland&#x27;s death, in 1974, the Miller School of Medicine established the Sutherland Memorial Lecture. In 1976, Vanderbilt University created the Sutherland Prize which is awarded annually to a faculty member whose work has garnered them national, if not international, acclaim and respect. Recipients are awarded $5,000, and their name is engraved on a silver bowl. Vanderbilt honored Sutherland in 1997 by starting a Sutherland lecture, and again in 2001 in the creation of the Sutherland Chair of Pharmacology. Heidi E. Hamm, a member of the Vanderbilt faculty, was appointed to this position upon its establishment and still maintains this title.

<doc id="810317" wikidata="Q1631187" url="?curid=810317" title="Hothouse Flowers">
<text>Hothouse Flowers are an Irish rock band that combine traditional Irish music with influences from soul, gospel and rock. Formed in 1985 in Dublin, they started as street performers. Their first album, &quot;People&quot; (1988), was the most successful debut album in Irish history, reaching No. 1 in Ireland and No. 2 in the UK. After two more albums and extensive touring, the group separated in 1994. Since getting back together in 1998, the band members have been sporadically issuing new songs and touring, but also pursuing solo careers.

==Career==
The group first formed in 1985 when Liam Ó Maonlaí and Fiachna Ó Braonáin, who had known each other as children in an Irish-speaking school, Coláiste Eoin in Booterstown, Dublin, began performing as street musicians, also known as buskers, on the streets of Dublin as &quot;The Incomparable Benzini Brothers&quot;. They were soon joined by Peter O&#x27;Toole and had won a street-entertainer award within a year. They renamed the group &quot;Hothouse Flowers&quot; (the name was suggested by singer Maria Doyle Kennedy during a brain-storming by band-members and friends in the Trinity College Arts Block café) and began writing songs and performing throughout Ireland. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called them &quot;the best-unsigned band in Europe&quot;.

In 1986, Bono from the band U2 saw the Flowers performing on television and offered his support. They released their first single, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Work This Way&quot;, on U2&#x27;s Mother Records label, which quickly led to a deal with the PolyGram subsidiary London Records.

Their first album, &quot;People&quot;, was released in May 1988 and was the most successful debut album in Irish history. It reached the #1 slot in Ireland within a week and eventually reached No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. The third single off the album &quot;Feet on the Ground&quot; shot to the No. 1 slot in Ireland on 19 March 1988. The international success of the album received a boost when a music video for the first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, was played in the interval between contestants and the scoring in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest. This propelled the song to No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart, the highest position the band would ever achieve in this chart. In September 1988, the band appeared on the bill at the Reading Festival. In June 1989 they played at the Glastonbury Festival, and appeared there again the following year.
The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Home&quot; was released in June 1990. It was recorded sporadically during extensive touring; with sessions in Dublin, London, a rented house with a mobile recording set-up in Carlow, Ireland, and one day of work with Daniel Lanois in New Orleans, while Bob Dylan was taking a break from his sessions with Lanois. The album did not have the overwhelming success of the first record, but it did reach No. 1 in Australia in 1991. &quot;Give It Up&quot; and &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; (a cover version of the Johnny Nash song) from the album reached No. 30 and 23 respectively in the UK Singles Chart.

In 1989, the Flowers collaborated with the Indigo Girls on their song &quot;Closer To Fine&quot;, which became a US hit, and led to some exposure in the United States for the group (albeit limited, as their contribution to the song was uncredited).

In January 1992, the group appeared (as themselves) in an episode of the popular BBC drama series &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, entitled No Strings.

In 1992, Hothouse Flowers joined Def Leppard – the combined group going by the name The Acoustic Hippies From Hell – to record three songs (&quot;From the Inside&quot;, a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;, and a cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Little Wing&quot;) that were included as B-sides on Def Leppard&#x27;s single &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot;, from their album &quot;Adrenalize&quot;.

&quot;Songs from the Rain&quot; was released in March 1993. Though it received good reviews and achieved some chart success in Australia and Ireland, worldwide sales were disappointing. In an attempt to boost record sales (and especially to break into the United States charts), the record label and the band&#x27;s management kept the group on the road almost continuously for the entire year. The band also participated in the Another Roadside Attraction tour in Canada that year, and collaborated with The Tragically Hip, Crash Vegas, Midnight Oil and Daniel Lanois on the one-off single &quot;Land&quot; to protest forest clearcutting in British Columbia.

By early 1994, Ó Maonlaí had decided that the group was suffering from physical, mental and creative exhaustion, and he called for a year-long sabbatical.

The year-long break turned into several years, as the band members recouped their energy and experienced changes in their personal lives, including divorces, marriages, the birth of children and the death of Ó Maonlaí&#x27;s father. The group also split from their long-time manager, and Leo Barnes (saxophone) and Jerry Fehily (drum kit) left the group. O&#x27;Toole and Ó Braonáin spent some of their time off from the Hothouse Flowers recording and touring with Michelle Shocked. Ó Maonlaí worked with Tim Finn and Andy White (see ALT (band)), while also studying traditional Irish music.

In May 1998 they released &quot;Born&quot;. Joined by Wayne Sheehy on drums and Rob Malone on bass guitar, this album contained extensive songwriting contributions from O&#x27;Toole, who (freed from his bass responsibilities) played mostly guitar, bouzouki and keyboards on the recording. The music also incorporated more elements of electronic loops, synthesizers and studio effects. The following month, they appeared at the 1998 Glastonbury Festival.

By 1999 they had reached the end of their contract with London Records, and both the label and the band decided not to renew. The label head allowed the group the rights to record songs from their past London releases and produce a live record. &quot;Live&quot; was self-released by the group later that year, taken mostly from an October 1998 show in the National Stadium, Dublin, with one track from a November show in Tokyo. Sheehy and Malone left the group shortly after the release of the record. Dave Clarke, formerly of Blue in Heaven, joined on drums and O&#x27;Toole returned to the bass.

In 2000 London Records released a compilation album of songs from their four previous albums titled &quot;Hothouse Flowers: The Best Of – 2000&quot;.

During the band&#x27;s official hiatus between &quot;Songs From the Rain&quot; and &quot;Born&quot;, band members had both written songs individually, and sporadically got together to write collaboratively. Some of these songs were never released, while others altered significantly to become some of the tracks on &quot;Born&quot;. In 2003 the Flowers collected these unreleased recordings and issued them as &quot;Vaults: Volume 1&quot;.

In February 2004 the band released the album &quot;Into Your Heart&quot;, produced by the band and John Reynolds. The first single, &quot;Your Love Goes On&quot;, reached #3 on the Irish charts. The album also reached #3 on the Irish Album Chart. The record was released on the RubyMusic label in Europe and distributed by Redeye in the United States. They have toured extensively in support of the record, including a performance at the Glastonbury Festival in 2004. Peter O&#x27;Toole left the band after this.

Ó Maonlaí has done several tours as a solo acoustic performer and released an album in 2005 called &quot;Rian&quot;.

In 2007, Ó Braonáin appeared on Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s album &quot;Voila&quot;, singing a duet with her on a cover of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. Hothouse Flowers appeared at the Glastonbury Festival Acoustic tent in 2007. Ó Braonáin and Clarke have also collaborated with a former member of The Pogues in the group Pre-Nup, who have opened some shows in America for Hothouse Flowers. An album by Pre-Nup, &quot;Hell to Pay&quot;, was released on 4 September 2007.

In February 2008 Martin Brunsden (double bass) played his first gig with the band and has been playing with them onstage ever since.

In late 2008, Ó Maonlaí released his follow up album to &quot;Rian&quot;, entitled &quot;To Be Touched&quot;. In 2015, O&#x27;Toole rejoined the band, and they toured the UK in October and November of that year, with the tour named &quot;Away with the Traveling Circus&quot;. During an interview on &quot;The Imelda May Show&quot; in Ireland, the band confirmed they were working on a new album, tentatively scheduled for release in early 2016. Some material from the album was played during the tour, and the album was finally released on 17 November 2016, called &quot;Let&#x27;s Do This Thing&quot; and recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin.

The band played a live version of their cover &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; on the premiere episode of Amazon Prime&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; first made available to stream in November 2016.
As a result, they saw an upswing in popularity, with &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; going to no. 1 on the iTunes Rock Chart Singles in the UK.

Former band member, saxophone player Leo Barnes, died of an apparent brain hemorrhage in April, 2022.

<text>The Sacramento Bee is a daily newspaper published in Sacramento, California, in the United States. Since its foundation in 1857, &quot;The Bee&quot; has become the largest newspaper in Sacramento, the fifth largest newspaper in California, and the 27th largest paper in the U.S. It is distributed in the upper Sacramento Valley, with a total circulation area that spans about : south to Stockton, California, north to the Oregon border, east to Reno, Nevada, and west to the San Francisco Bay Area.

&quot;The Bee&quot; is the flagship of the nationwide McClatchy Company. Its &quot;Scoopy Bee&quot; mascot, created by Walt Disney in 1943, has been used by all three &quot;Bee&quot; newspapers (in Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno).

== History ==
Under the name &quot;The Daily Bee&quot;, the first issue of the newspaper was published on February 3, 1857, proudly boasting that &quot;the object of this newspaper is not only independence, but permanence&quot;. At this time, &quot;The Bee&quot; was in competition with the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot;, a newspaper founded in 1851. Although &quot;The Bee&quot; soon surpassed the &quot;Union&quot; in popularity, the &quot;Union&quot; survived until its closure in 1994, leaving &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; to be the longest-running newspaper in the city&#x27;s history.

The first editor of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; was John Rollin Ridge, but James McClatchy took over the position by the end of the first week.

Also within a week of its creation, &quot;The Bee&quot; uncovered a state scandal which led to the impeachment of Know-Nothing California State Treasurer Henry Bates.

In 1925 it absorbed the &quot;Sacramento Star&quot;, which was founded in 1904.

=== 21st century ===
On March 13, 2006, The McClatchy Company announced its agreement to purchase Knight Ridder, the United States&#x27; second-largest chain of daily newspapers. The purchase price of $4.5 billion in cash and stock gave McClatchy 32 daily newspapers in 29 markets, with a total circulation of 3.3 million.

On February 3, 2007, the paper celebrated its 150th anniversary, and a copy of the original issue was included in every newspaper. On February 4, 2007, a 120-page section was included about the paper&#x27;s history from its founding to today. In 2008, &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; redesigned and changed its layout.

In the fall of 2020, the &quot;Bee&quot; announced it would be vacating its longtime headquarters and printing plant in Midtown Sacramento at 21st and Q Streets (which it occupied since 1952), citing the need to cut costs and streamline in the wake of declining ad revenues, the rise of online journalism and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which most journalists and employees worked from home. The paper began being printed at the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; printing plant in the Bay Area suburb of Fremont. The following spring, the &quot;Bee&quot; announced the editorial offices were relocating to the Cannery, a business park about a mile east, at Stockton and Alhambra Boulevards; the business park is the redeveloped Libby, McNeill and Libby Cannery, which operated from 1912 to 1982.

== Recognition ==
&quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; has won six Pulitzer Prizes in its history. It has won numerous other awards, including many for its progressive public service campaigns promoting free speech (the &quot;Bee&quot; often criticized government policy, and uncovered many scandals hurting Californians), anti-racism (&quot;The Bee&quot; supported the Union during the American Civil War and publicly denounced the Ku Klux Klan), worker&#x27;s rights (&quot;The Bee&quot; has a strong history of supporting unionization), and environmental protection (leading numerous tree-planting campaigns and fighting against environmental destruction in the Sierra Nevada).

<doc id="810329" wikidata="Q254673" url="?curid=810329" title="Kato Svanidze">
<text>Ekaterine &quot;Kato&quot; Svanidze (2 April 1885 – 22 November 1907) was the first wife of Joseph Stalin and the mother of his eldest son, Yakov Dzhugashvili.

Born in Racha, in western Georgia, Svanidze eventually moved to Tiflis with her two sisters and brother, and worked as a seamstress. Her brother Alexander was a confidant of Stalin, then still known by his birth name of Ioseb Jughashvili, and introduced him to Svanidze in 1905. They were married in 1906 and she gave birth to son Yakov a few months later. The family moved to Baku to avoid arrest, though Svanidze got quite ill there and returned to Tiflis in 1907, dying shortly after her return, likely from typhoid or tuberculosis. Her death had a profound effect on Stalin, who deeply cared for Svanidze. He abandoned Yakov to be raised by the Svanidze family, and rarely saw them again, fully immersing himself in his revolutionary activities.

==Svanidze family==
Ekaterine Svanidze was born in Baji, Georgia, a small village in Racha, a region of Georgia, which was then part of the Kutais Governorate within the Russian Empire. Her parents were Svimon, a railway worker and landowner, and Sephora Dvali, both descendants of an impoverished minor Georgian nobility. She had two sisters, Aleksandra (Sashiko; c. 1878–1936) and Maria (Mariko; 1888–1942), and a younger brother, Alexander (Alyosha; 1886–1941).

==Early life in Tiflis==

While their parents would move to Kutaisi, the four Svanidze siblings moved to Tiflis (now Tbilisi) and lived together in a house near Erivan Square (now Freedom Square) and behind the South Caucasus military district headquarters. Alyosha was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) in Georgia and a confidant of Ioseb Jughashvili (later known as Joseph Stalin). The three sisters took up working at an atelier for a French seamstress, Madame Hervieu, making uniforms and dresses for military officers and their wives. Sashiko would marry Mikheil Monaselidze, another Bolshevik who also knew Jughashvili when they were students at the Tbilisi Theological Seminary.

In 1905, Alyosha invited Jughashvili to live with him, his three sisters and his brother-in-law, Mikheil Monaselidze. The atelier was frequented by the sisters&#x27; upper-class clientele, which combined with its central location, made it ideal for a hideout. &quot;Our place above the suspicion of the police. While my fellows did illegal stuff in one room, my wife was fitting the dresses of generals&#x27; wives next door,&quot; Monaselidze later wrote. It is likely that Jughashvili first met Svanidze at this point, though it is possible he had previously hid out with her parents.

Jughashvili was soon interested in Svanidze; he would later describe her to his daughter Svetlana as &quot;very sweet and beautiful: she melted my heart.&quot; According to Iremashvili, Svanidze herself &quot;worshipped [Jughashvili] &#x27;like a demigod&#x27; but understood him. She was fascinated by [Jughashvili], and enchanted by his ideas,&quot; finding him charming. But she was also, as Montefiore notes, an educated woman in her own right and had taken an active interest in Bolshevism, organising fundraisers for the Social Democrats and helping tend to wounded revolutionaries.

==Marriage==

By the summer of 1906, Svanidze and Jughashvili decided to get married. At the time, she was newly pregnant, and while it is not known if she was aware of this, historian Stephen Kotkin has suggested this was the impetus for the wedding. Much like Jughashvili&#x27;s mother, Keke Geladze, Svanidze was very devout and insisted on a religious wedding in a church, which the atheist Jughashvili accepted. There was difficulty in finding a priest willing to marry them, as Jughashvili was using false documents with the name &quot;Galiashvili,&quot; one of the aliases he was using at the time. Monaselidze eventually found a priest willing to perform the service, Kita Tkhinvaleli, who had also been a classmate of Jughashvili at the Seminary. However, Tkhinvaleli only agreed to do it if they held the wedding late at night. The wedding took place around 2:00am on 16 July 1906, in a church next to the Svanidze residence.

Afterwards, a small dinner party was held for the ten guests, with Mikhail Tskhakaya, a Bolshevik mentor to Jughashvili, serving as the &quot;tamada&quot; (toastmaster, an important figure at Georgian celebrations). Jughashvili did not invite his mother to the wedding, or even tell her about it beforehand. After the wedding, a police officer visited the house, though as Jughashvili had been paying him there were no arrests.

Despite the law requiring marriages to be recorded in one&#x27;s internal passport, Svanidze did not do so, ostensibly to protect Jughashvili, who was known to the Okhrana, the imperial Russian secret police. She also continued to actively help the Bolsheviks, and in November 1906 hosted a contact from Moscow. This individual was a double agent and after he left, Svanidze and her cousin, Spiridon Dvali, were arrested on 13 November. Svanidze was jailed while Dvali, charged with making bombs, was sentenced to death. After six weeks in prison, Svanidze was released; she was let go both due to her condition (four months&#x27; pregnant), and Sashiko asking her clients from the atelier for help; Dvali&#x27;s sentence was also commuted, and he was given a reduced sentence. Though released from prison, Svandize was not allowed back home, but instead housed at the police chief&#x27;s home for two months. Jughashvili would frequently visit her, as the officers did not recognise him.

On 18 March 1907, Svanidze gave birth to a son, Iakob, with both Jughashvili and his mother present for the birth. Jughashvili continued with his work after the birth of Yakov, though he would play with him at times, calling the child &quot;Patsan&quot; (&quot;&quot;). A few months after Iakob&#x27;s birth, Jughashvili was involved in a high-profile Tiflis bank robbery, and the three of them fled to Baku to avoid arrest. They rented a &quot;Tartar house with a low ceiling on the Bailov Peninsula&quot; just outside the city right on the sea. Svanidze tried to find a job, but with a small child to care for it was impossible to do so.

==Illness and death==

Jughashvili was frequently away from home, leaving Svanidze alone in a place where she did not know many people. The stress of worrying about Jughashvili, as well as the isolation and warm climate took a toll on her health, and Svanidze soon fell ill. Her family invited her to move back to Racha, which has a much milder climate, to recover and be with people she knew, but Svanidze was reluctant to abandon her husband. By October, her condition had worsened, and Jughashvili was concerned enough he brought her back to Tiflis, though he soon returned to Baku. However, on the 13-hour journey back to Georgia, Svanidze drank some contaminated water, and likely contracted typhoid. In Tiflis, she began to hemorrhage blood from her bowels. Jughashvili visited her once, and she died on 22 November 1907, three weeks after her return to Tiflis.

Her death was announced in a newspaper, &quot;Tsqaro&quot; (წყარო, &quot;Source&quot;), and a funeral was held at 9:00am on 25 November in the same church she had married Jughashvili. Svanidze was then buried at a church in the Kukia district of Tiflis. According to the Georgian Menshevik Ioseb Iremashvili, Jughashvili was very distraught at the death of his wife, and at the funeral allegedly said &quot;This creature softened my heart of stone. She died and with her died my last warm feelings for humanity.&quot; He would also later tell a girlfriend that he &quot;was so overcome with grief that [his] comrades took [his] gun away from [him].&quot; During the burial, Jughashvili also reportedly threw himself into her grave, and had to be dragged out. As he had been trailed by Okhrana agents, Jughashvili fled before the service ended. He left Tiflis and returned to Baku, abandoning 8-month-old Iakob to be raised by his Svanidze relatives. Jughashvili did not return to visit his son for several years.

==Aftermath==
Iakob spent the next fourteen years being raised by the Svanidzes. He was brought to Moscow in 1921 to live with his father; it proved a difficult transition for Iakob, who only spoke Georgian and did not understand Russian, and was treated poorly by his father. Other members of the Svanidze family also moved to Moscow, and Jughashvili, by now known as Joseph Stalin, would occasionally visit them.
Svanidze&#x27;s brother Alyosha later married an opera singer, Maria Anisimovna Korona, and rose in the ranks of the Communist Party. Her sister Mariko also moved to Moscow and worked as secretary to Avel Enukidze. In 1937, during the Great Purge, Mariko was arrested as part of the accusations against Enukidze, who was executed shortly after. In 1938, Stalin ordered Alyosha and his wife, Maria, to be arrested. He demanded Alyosha admit he was a German spy, but Alyosha refused. Alyosha was executed in 1941, while Mariko and Maria were shot in 1942. Alyosha and Maria&#x27;s son, Ivan Svanidze, was briefly married to Stalin&#x27;s only daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva. He filed for divorce in 1959; Soviet law required the divorce decree be printed in the newspaper along with their home addresses.

<text>Philippe François Marie Leclerc de Hauteclocque (22 November 1902 – 28 November 1947) was a Free-French general during World War II. He became Marshal of France posthumously in 1952, and is known in France simply as  or just Leclerc.

The son of an aristocratic family, Hauteclocque graduated from the , the French military academy, in 1924. After service with the French Occupation of the Ruhr and in Morocco, he returned to Saint-Cyr as an instructor. He was awarded the for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August 1933.

During the Second World War he fought in the Battle of France. He was one of the first who defied his government&#x27;s Armistice to make his way to Britain to fight with the Free French under General Charles de Gaulle, adopting the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; of Leclerc so that his wife and children would not be put at risk if his name appeared in the papers. He was sent to French Equatorial Africa, where he rallied local leaders to the rebel Free French cause, and led a force against Gabon, whose leaders supported the French (Vichy) Government. From Chad he led raids into Italian Libya. After his forces captured Kufra, he had his men swear an oath known today as the , in which they pledged to fight on until their flag flew over the Strasbourg Cathedral. The forces under his command, known as L Force, campaigned in Libya in 1943, covered the Eighth Army&#x27;s inland flank during its advance into Tunisia, and participated in the attack on the Mareth Line. L Force was then transformed into the , although it was often referred to as . It fought under Leclerc&#x27;s command in the Battle of Normandy, and participated in the liberation of Paris and Strasbourg.

After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, he was given command of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (, CEFEO). He represented France at the surrender of the Japanese Empire in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. He quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the nascent conflict in Indochina, but once again was ahead of his countrymen, and was recalled to France in 1946. He was killed in an air crash in Algeria in 1947.

== Early life ==

Philippe François Marie de Hauteclocque was born on 22 November 1902 at Belloy-Saint-Léonard in the department of Somme, France. He was the fifth of six children of Adrien de Hauteclocque, comte de Hauteclocque (1864–1945), and Marie-Thérèse van der Cruisse de Waziers (1870–1956). Philippe was named in honour of an ancestor killed by Croatian soldiers in service of Habsburg monarchy during Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1635.

Hauteclocque came from an old line of country nobility. His direct ancestors had served in the Fifth Crusade against Egypt, and again in the Eighth Crusade of Saint Louis against Tunisia in 1270. They had also fought at the Battle of Saint-Omer in 1340 and the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. The family managed to survive the French Revolution. Three members of the family served in Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grande Armée&quot; and a fourth, who suffered from weak health, served in the supply train. The third son, Constantin, who had served in Napoleon&#x27;s Russian Campaign, was created a &quot;chevalier&quot; by King Louis XVIII, and a Papal count by Pope Pius IX in 1857. Constantin had two sons. The older, Alfred François Marie (1822–1902), died childless. The younger, Gustave François Marie Joseph (1829–1914), became a noted Egyptologist.

Gustave, in turn, had three sons. The first, Henry (1862–1914), and third, Wallerand (1866–1914), became officers in the French Army, serving during the colonial campaigns, including fighting Samory in the Sudan. Both were killed in the early fighting of the First World War. The second son was Adrien, who enlisted in August 1914 as a trooper in the &quot;&quot;, the regiment in which his son Guy was a cornet. Adrien was later commissioned, and was twice awarded the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; for gallantry. He survived the war, and inherited the family title and estate in Belloy-Saint-Léonard.

== Early military career ==
Philippe de Hauteclocque was homeschooled until he was 13, when he was sent to &quot; L&#x27;école de la Providence&quot;, a Jesuit school in Amiens. In 1920, at the age of 17, he went to &quot;Lycée privé Sainte-Geneviève&quot;, known as &quot;Ginette&quot;, a preparatory school in Versailles. He then entered the &quot;École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr&quot;, the French military academy. Each class has a name; his was &quot;Metz et Strasbourg&quot; after towns in Alsace and Lorraine returned to France by the Treaty of Versailles. He graduated on 1 October 1924, and was commissioned as a &quot;sous lieutenant&quot; in the French Army. Having chosen the cavalry branch, he then had to attend the Cavalry School in Saumur, from which he graduated first in his class on 8 August 1925.

Hauteclocque&#x27;s older brother Guy had married Madeleine de Gargan, the daughter of the Baron de Gargan. Philippe became a frequent visitor to the Gargan household, and became enchanted by Madeleine&#x27;s youngest sister Thérèse. The two courted while he was at Saint-Cyr. In the tradition of old noble families, Count Adrien asked Baron de Gargan for permission for Philippe to marry Thérèse. The wedding ceremony took place in the Church of St Joan of Arc in Rouen on 10 August 1925. For a wedding present, Adrien gave them a chateau in Tailly. They had six children: Henri (1926–1952), who was killed in the First Indochina War; Hubert (1927–2015), who served as mayor of Tailly from 2001 to 2008; Charles (1929–); Jeanne (1931–2018); Michel (1933–2014); and Bénédicte (1936–). Philippe and Thérèse hired an Austrian governess, and spoke German in front of their children to improve their command of the language.

Having graduated from Saumur, Hauteclocque joined his regiment, the &#x27;, which was then on occupation duty in Trier as part of the Franco-Belgian occupation of the Ruhr. Garrison duty was not to his liking, so he volunteered for service with the &#x27;, based at Taza in Morocco. He was promoted to &quot;lieutenant&quot; in October 1926. In 1927, he was posted as an instructor at the &quot;Military School of Dar El-Beida&quot; at Meknes, the military academy of French Morocco. Here, he met , a First World War veteran eight years his senior, who would later volunteer to serve under his command. In 1929, he was attached to the &quot;38e Goum Mixte Marocains&quot;, a Moroccan Goumier unit at M&#x27;Zizel in the Atlas Mountains. He saw action in the fighting against the Ait Hammou guerrillas. In one action, two horses were shot out from under him. Afterwards, he was posted to the &quot;, &quot;the senior cavalry regiment of the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Afrique&quot;, based at Rabat.
In February 1931, Hauteclocque went back to Saint-Cyr as an instructor, but wanted to return to active service. During the summer break in 1933, he flew south to Africa, where he reported to &quot;Général de brigade&quot; Henri Giraud on 11 July. Giraud sent him into the field as a liaison officer with a &quot;goum&quot;. He was awarded the &quot;croix de guerre des théâtres d&#x27;opérations extérieures&quot; for leading &quot;goumiers&quot; in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August. The Commander in Chief in Morocco, &quot;Général de division&quot; Antoine Huré, felt that Hauteclocque should not have been there, and held the award up for three years. Others felt differently, and Hauteclocque was given early admission to the course for promotion to &quot;capitaine&quot;. He placed fourth in the class, and was promoted on 25 December 1934. Promotion was slow in the inter-war French Army, especially in the cavalry, and he was only the second in his Saint-Cyr class to reach that rank. Most had to wait until 1936. He was also made a &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot;.

Although they were devout Catholics, Hauteclocque and Thérèse subscribed to &quot;Action Française&quot;, the journal of a far-right political organisation of the same name, despite a papal interdict against it, and continued to do so even after Thérèse was refused absolution. In contrast, his cousin was an award-winning journalist who covered the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany, visited the concentration camp at Dachau, and wrote about the Night of Long Knives. Xavier died in April 1935, convinced that he had been poisoned by the Nazis. After the Second World War, Hauteclocque destroyed his copies of &quot;Action Française&quot;.

Hauteclocque broke his leg in two places in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company that it was his own fault for riding on the shoulder of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.

In November 1938, Hauteclocque entered the &quot;École supérieure de guerre&quot;, the French Army&#x27;s staff college, as part of its 60th class. On graduating in July 1939, he was ordered to report to the &quot;&quot; (4e DI) as its chief of staff.

== Fall of France ==

On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The 4e DI was ordered to hold the line of the Sambre river. Hauteclocque was placed in charge of three infantry battalions. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the Canal de l&#x27;Escaut. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the Lille pocket on 28 May. Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines. He attempted to make his way back to the French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then made his way to the Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.
Hauteclocque reported to the headquarters of &quot;Général d&#x27;armée&quot; Aubert Frère, the commander of the Seventh Army, who gave him permission to visit his home at Tailly, which was still behind French lines. When he got there, however, he found that Thérèse had fled to Sainte-Foy-la-Grande in the southwest of France, where she had relatives. On returning to the Seventh Army, he was ordered to join the &quot;2ème groupement cuirassé,&quot; a scratch force of armoured and mechanised units that included Brigadier General Stanisław Maczek&#x27;s Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade. The &quot;groupement &quot; launched a series of counter-attacks. Lacking a radio, Hauteclocque gave directions to the Char B1 tanks with his cane. On 15 June, he was wounded in the head during a German air attack, and was taken to a hospital in a convent in Avallon. There he was again taken prisoner when the area was overrun by the Germans.

This time, Hauteclocque escaped by jumping out a window. After the armistice was signed on 22 June, French soldiers who had not been captured were simply allowed to go home, and the Germans were friendly towards Hauteclocque, especially when they discovered that he spoke fluent German. He made his way to rejoin his family by car and bicycle. So that he could cross from the zone occupée into the zone libre where Thérèse and the children were, his sister Yvonne obtained an identity card for him in the name of &quot;Leclerc&quot;. It was his first use of this name. He also told Yvonne that he intended to join &quot;Général de brigade&quot; Charles de Gaulle in Britain. He was reunited with his family in Saint-Germain-les-Vergnes on 30 June but stayed with them for only four days before setting out for Spain. He managed to obtain a visa on the second attempt, being refused the first time for carrying too much money with him. Once in Spain he took a train to Madrid, and then to Lisbon, where he went to the British embassy, which arranged his passage to Britain on a merchant ship, the SS &quot;Hillary&quot;.

== Africa ==
Leclerc arrived in London on 25 July 1940, and met with de Gaulle, who announced that he was promoting him to &quot;Chef d&#x27;escadrons&quot; (major). He also encountered his cousin Pierre de Hauteclocque, Xavier&#x27;s brother, who was serving with the &quot;13e Demi-Brigade de Légion Étrangère&quot; (13e DBLE, an infantry regiment of the French Foreign Legion). This was the largest unit that had joined the Free French Forces. After participating in the Battles of Narvik, it had found itself in Britain when France surrendered. Formed after the war began, it contained many men who had fought for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War, and many refugees from Nazi and Fascist countries. Leclerc then offered his own services to the unit, but its commander, &quot;Colonel&quot; Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, rejected his offer on the grounds that he was high-born, over-qualified and a cavalryman.

Instead, in August 1940, de Gaulle ordered Leclerc to French Equatorial Africa, where the local leaders had declared themselves for Free France, as the governor of French Cameroon. At this time he adopted Leclerc as his &quot;nom de guerre&quot;, so that Thérèse and their children would not be put at risk if his name appeared in the papers. He quickly secured the Free French grip on Cameroon. He then led a force consisting of the 13e DBLE and Senegalese Tirailleurs against Gabon, whose local leader supported Vichy France. The Battle of Gabon lasted from 12 October to 12 November 1940, and ended with 20 dead and Gabon in Free French hands. Vichy prisoners were held as hostages in case Vichy France tried to retaliate against the families of Free Frenchmen. When Louis-Michel-François Tardy, the Bishop of Libreville, refused to conduct a mass to celebrate the victory, Leclerc had him arrested. &quot;Capitaine de corvette&quot; Georges Thierry d&#x27;Argenlieu conducted the service in his capacity as a Carmelite priest.
With Gabon in hand, de Gaulle sent Leclerc to Chad, the only Free French territory that shared a border with territory controlled by Axis Powers, along its Sahara Desert border with Italian-controlled Libya. Leclerc&#x27;s attention was drawn to two Italian outposts in the desert, Murzuk in southwestern Libya and Kufra in the southeast. Both were over from his base at Fort Lamy in Chad. He started with a small raid on Murzuk by eleven men of the &quot;Régiment de Tirailleurs Sénégalais du Tchad&quot; (RTST) and two troops of the British Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) on 11 January 1941. In February, he led a much larger operation that captured Kufra. After the battle, he had his men swear an oath known today as the &quot;Serment de Koufra&quot; (&quot;Oath of Kufra&quot;):
Leclerc learnt a great deal about how to handle and supply a force advancing across the desert, and was rewarded with the British Distinguished Service Order. He began planning a far more ambitious advance into Libya. This was delayed by a year due to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel&#x27;s defeat of the British Eighth Army in the Battle of Gazala, and the subsequent German and Italian advance into Egypt. Leclerc was promoted to &quot;Général de brigade&quot; in August 1941, and pinned two metal stars captured from the Italians on his &quot;kepi&quot;.

De Gaulle ordered the plan for an advance into Libya to be put in motion in the wake of the Eighth Army&#x27;s victory in the Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942. Leclerc set out from Fort Lamy on 16 December 1942 with 500 European and 2,700 African troops in 350 vehicles. He captured Sebha on 12 January 1943, and Mizdah on 22 January. He reached Tripoli on 26 January, where he was greeted by the Eighth Army&#x27;s commander, General Bernard Montgomery. Leclerc&#x27;s command, now reinforced by the Greek Sacred Squadron, and known as L Force, covered the Eighth Army&#x27;s inland flank during its advance into Tunisia. L Force beat off a German counterattack on 10 March, and participated in the attack on the Mareth Line.

== Western Europe ==

After the fighting in North Africa ended, Leclerc&#x27;s L Force, now about 4,000 strong, became the &quot;2e Division Française Libre&quot; (2e DFL). In June 1943, de Gaulle informed him the 2e DFL would be re-equipped by the Americans as an armoured division, the &quot;2e Division Blindée&quot; (2e DB). It was often called &quot;La Division Leclerc&quot;. Although organised along American lines, its units had French titles. The non-white units were transferred elsewhere. The remainder of 2e DFL became the &quot;Regiment de Marche du Tchad&quot; (RMT), 2e DB&#x27;s motorised infantry regiment. Free French armoured units serving with the Eighth Army became the 501e Régiment de chars de combat (501e RCC). The artillery and the other two armoured regiments of 2e DB, the &quot;12e Régiment de Cuirassiers&quot; (12e RC) and the &quot;&quot; (12e RCA), were drawn from the Vichy &quot;Armée d&#x27;Afrique&quot;. Perhaps the most unusual unit in the division was the &quot;Régiment Blindé de Fusiliers-Marins&quot; (RBFM), sailors who served as a tank destroyer regiment. Leclerc had to weld the various units, some of whom had recently been fighting against the Allies, into a team. This was no easy task. When two men from the 501e RCC upset a former Vichy officer by singing a disrespectful song about &quot;Général d&#x27;armée&quot; Henri Giraud, resulting in a fight, he told the officer concerned that respect had to be earned.

In April 1944, 2e DB was shipped to Britain to participate in Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of northern France. Leclerc and his staff travelled by air in a converted B-24 Liberator bomber. The division moved to training areas in Yorkshire, where Leclerc established his headquarters on the estate of Henry Frederick Hotham, 7th Baron Hotham, at Dalton Hall, Beverley. Training was conducted in concert with Maczek&#x27;s 1st Polish Armoured Division.

On 1 August 1944, 2e DB landed at Utah Beach in Normandy as part of Major General Wade Haislip&#x27;s United States XV Corps of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr.&#x27;s United States Third Army. Both of these American generals spoke French fluently. Later that month, 2e DB participated in the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, which inflicted a major defeat on the German Army. Like most new division commanders, Leclerc also made errors, in his case by allowing 2e DB to use roads that had been earmarked for American units, thereby causing traffic jams and holding up the American advance.

The next assignment for 2e DB, and the one that it had been brought from Africa for, was the liberation of Paris. Allied troops initially avoided the historic city, moving around it to minimise the danger of destruction if the Germans sought to defend it. When Parisians rose against the Germans, de Gaulle and Leclerc persuaded General Dwight D. Eisenhower to help. Leclerc&#x27;s men had to fight their way into Paris, and when they got there they found German infantry and tanks still holding parts of the city. The German commander, &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Dietrich von Choltitz, was inclined to surrender, and did so to Leclerc and Henri Rol-Tanguy of the French Forces of the Interior at the Gare Montparnasse on 25 August 1944. Leclerc arranged for Ensign Philippe de Gaulle, who was serving in the RBFM, to be in attendance, but the elder de Gaulle was annoyed that Leclerc had allowed the communist Rol to co-sign the surrender. The next day de Gaulle held a triumphal parade, accompanied by senior military figures including Leclerc, Alphonse Juin, Marie-Pierre Kœnig and Georges Thierry d&#x27;Argenlieu.
Montgomery&#x27;s troops liberated Tailly, allowing Leclerc to return home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about their ages to volunteer for service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a Sherman tank gunner with the 12e RCA. Other relatives also served with the division, including two nephews. The fighting in Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number were lost in the fighting in surrounding areas. These were replaced by men and women who, like Leclerc&#x27;s sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the Bois de Boulogne.

After Paris, 2e DB returned to XV Corps at Leclerc&#x27;s request. He won a notable victory on 12–16 September 1944 at the Battle of Dompaire against the Panzer IVs and Panther tanks of the German 112th &quot;Panzer&quot; Brigade by using manoeuvre and air power to compensate for the numerical and technical inferiority of his tanks. American historian Hugh M. Cole wrote that &quot;this fight, characterised warmly by the XV Corps commander as a &#x27;brilliant example&#x27; of perfect air-ground co-ordination, not only was an outstanding feat of arms but also dealt a crippling blow to Hitler&#x27;s plans for an armoured thrust into the Third Army flank.&quot;
Patton personally pinned a Silver Star on Leclerc, and brought with him another six Silver Stars and 25 Bronze Star Medals for other members of the 2e DB. Patton then gave Leclerc his next objective: the town of Baccarat and the bridge there over the Meurthe River. The bridge was captured before the Germans could destroy it. Haislip&#x27;s XV Corps was transferred to the Seventh United States Army on 29 September, and Leclerc feared that 2e DB would be transferred to &quot;Général d&#x27;armée&quot; Jean de Lattre de Tassigny&#x27;s French First Army. Leclerc regarded the First Army as being full of traitors who had supported Vichy France. Moreover, de Lattre had sacked &quot;Général de division&quot; Edgard de Larminat for Gaullist sentiments, and Leclerc had good reason to fear that he might meet a similar fate.

On 22 November, Haislip gave Leclerc permission to advance on Strasbourg. Leclerc surprised the Germans by advancing over country roads and tracks to bypass their defences. Strasbourg was reached on 25 November, and that afternoon the Tricolour flew over the Strasbourg Cathedral. The German offensive in the Ardennes in December and in Alsace in January led Eisenhower to consider abandoning Strasbourg, but strong opposition to the idea from the French caused him to back down. As a result, the 2e DB was transferred to de Lattre&#x27;s command to assist in the reduction of the Colmar Pocket.

Leclerc objected to the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The division rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited Dachau concentration camp after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place on 8 May 1945 at Karlstein near Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of a dozen captured Frenchmen of the SS &quot;Charlemagne&quot; Division. He asked them why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get rid of them. That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them three days later. On 2 June 1949 the bodies were exhumed and buried in the St. Zeno cemetery in Bad Reichenhall. For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.

== South East Asia ==

At the end of the Second World War in Europe in May 1945, Leclerc received command of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (&quot;Corps expéditionnaire français en Extrême-Orient&quot;, CEFEO). He represented France at the surrender of the Japanese Empire in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. On 28 November 1945, he legally changed his name to Jacques-Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, incorporating his Free French pseudonym.

Although he had never before served in the Far East, as CEFEO commander, Leclerc was charged with recovering French Indochina. This territory, comprising the present day states of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, had been conquered by the French during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Vichy regime had allowed the Japanese to use Indochina as a base from which to attack the Allies in Malaya, Burma and China. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese had deposed the French colonial government, taken direct control of Indochina, defeated the French army in several engagements, and imprisoned surviving French soldiers.

With the end of the war, Indochina was divided in two, with the area north of the 16th parallel occupied by 150,000 Nationalist Chinese troops, while the part to the south was occupied by 20,000 British and Indian troops of Major General Douglas Gracey&#x27;s 20th Indian Infantry Division. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese nationalist leader Ho Chi Minh had declared Vietnamese independence. Leclerc arrived in Saigon with a first contingent of French soldiers on 5 October 1945. He was dependent on the British for equipment and shipping. He did not get along well with D&#x27;Argenlieu, whom de Gaulle had appointed French High Commissioner for Indochina.

Leclerc heeded the advice he was given by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many soldiers as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the Central Highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho&#x27;s first priority was getting rid of the Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.

The French government negotiator Jean Sainteny flew to Saigon to consult Leclerc, who was acting as high commissioner in the absence of d&#x27;Argenlieu. Leclerc approved Sainteny&#x27;s proposal to negotiate with Ho because he preferred a diplomatic solution to a larger conflict, but he still dispatched a flotilla with shiploads of French soldiers to northern Vietnam ready to attack if the talks failed. At that time, Ho felt that negotiations with the French constituted his best option because the Soviet Union had not yet endorsed the Vietminh or the Vietnamese nationalist party (VNQDD), and the French Communist Party chose to support French rule in Vietnam.

On 6 March 1946, a tentative agreement was reached at the last minute (with Leclerc&#x27;s fleet already in the Gulf of Tonkin) between Sainteny and Ho. The agreement stated that France would recognise Vietnam as a free state within the French Union, a new name for the French empire broadly similar to the British Commonwealth, and that Ho would allow France to base 25,000 soldiers in Vietnam for five years. The Ho-Sainteny agreement was never confirmed because it disappointed people on both sides. Ho&#x27;s immense prestige largely silenced Vietnamese dissent, but the agreement caused a serious split within the French side. French businessmen, planters, and officials in Saigon were &quot;indignant at the prospect of losing their colonial privileges.&quot;

D&#x27;Argenlieu bluntly denounced Leclerc. &quot;I am amazed – yes, that is the word, amazed&quot;, he said, &quot;that France&#x27;s fine expeditionary corps in Indochina is commanded by officers who would rather negotiate than fight&quot;. D&#x27;Argenlieu stated that a higher level meeting in Paris would be required. He then unilaterally declared a French-controlled Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina without asking either Paris or the Vietnamese. In July 1946, Leclerc was replaced as commander of the French forces by Jean-Étienne Valluy. At the time many French and American politicians were willing to believe that Ho was part of a Soviet plan to dominate the world, but Leclerc warned that &quot;anti-communism will be a useless tool unless the problem of nationalism is resolved.&quot; His advice was simple: &quot;Negotiate at all costs!&quot;

== Death ==
Leclerc was appointed Inspector of Land Forces in North Africa. On 28 November 1947, his North American B-25 Mitchell, &quot;Tailly II&quot;, carrying Leclerc and his staff, crashed near Colomb-Béchar in French Algeria, killing everyone on board. His body was returned to France, where it was taken to Paris along the route that 2e DB had followed in August 1944. A funeral service was held at Notre Dame de Paris, and he was interred in a crypt at &quot;Les Invalides&quot;.

== Posthumous honours ==
Leclerc was posthumously created a Marshal of France on 23 August 1952, the anniversary of the day that 2e DB had entered Paris. Today his marshal&#x27;s baton is displayed in the Leclerc room of the Musée de l&#x27;Armée at &quot;Invalides&quot;, as is his battered képi with the Italian stars that he wore at Kufra.

The Leclerc tank built by GIAT Industries (&quot;Groupement Industriel des Armements Terrestres&quot;) of France is named after him. There is a monument to Leclerc in the Petit-Montrouge quarter of the 14th arrondissement in Paris, between &quot;Avenue de la Porte d&#x27;Orléans&quot; and &quot;Rue de la Légion Étrangère&quot;, and near the &quot;Square du Serment-de-Koufra&quot;. Two streets in Paris are named for him: &quot;Avenue du Général Leclerc&quot; in the 14th arrondissement and &quot;Rue du Maréchal Leclerc&quot; in the 12th arrondissement, between the &quot;Bois de Vincennes&quot; and the Marne River.

<text>Beinn Alligin () is one of the classic mountains of the Torridon region of Scotland, lying to the north of Loch Torridon, in the Highlands. The name Beinn Alligin is from the Scottish Gaelic, meaning &quot;Jewelled Hill&quot;. The mountain has two peaks of Munro status: Tom na Gruagaich () to the south, and Sgùrr Mhòr at to the north.

One of the most prominent features of Beinn Alligin is a great cleft known as Eag Dhubh na h-Eigheachd (&quot;black gash of the wailing&quot;) or Leum na Caillich, which cuts into the ridge south of the summit. It is the scar of the most spectacular rockslide or rock avalanche in Britain, which runs out into the corrie of Toll a&#x27; Mhadaidh Mor. It occurred around 3750 years ago and is around 3.5 million cubic metres in volume. According to local folklore shepherds on the mountain would hear cries from the gash; those who investigated the source of these cries would inevitably fall to their deaths.

Beinn Alligin lies on the National Trust for Scotland&#x27;s Torridon Estate, which has been owned by the charity since 1967, and forms part of both a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).

==Ascent==
The usual route of ascent starts from the minor road between Torridon village and Inveralligin, following the route of the Abhainn Coire Mhic Nobuil (a river), before heading up into the corrie of Coir nan Laogh. Steep grassy slopes then lead to the summit of Tom na Gruagaich. The main ridge of Beinn Alligin is then followed round to the north, leading the hillwalker towards Sgùrr Mhòr. Below the summit of this peak is a deep gash in the hillside known as Eag Dubh, the &quot;black notch&quot;, one of Beinn Alligin&#x27;s most recognisable features.
From the summit of Sgùrr Mhòr, it is possible to continue along the ridge, now heading in an easterly direction. The ridge at this point becomes much rockier, and a series of pinnacles known as the &quot;Horns of Alligin&quot; () must be negotiated. The horns provide good summer scrambling for those with a head for heights, but in winter they are a much more serious proposition.

An alternative descent, avoiding the horns, can be made by leaving the Beinn Alligin ridge at the bealach between the two summits, from where grassy slopes can be followed westwards down into a neighbouring glen. This route is not straightforward under winter conditions.

<text>Baking blind (sometimes called pre-baking) is the process of baking a pie crust or other pastry without the filling. Blind baking a pie crust is necessary when it will be filled with an unbaked filling (such as with pudding or cream pies), in which case the crust must be fully baked. It is also called for if the filling has a shorter bake time than the crust, in which case the crust is partly baked. Blind baking is also used to keep pie crust from becoming soggy due to a wet filling.

Blind baking can be accomplished by different methods. In one technique, the pie crust is lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper, then filled with pastry- or pie weights (sometimes called &quot;baking beans&quot;) to ensure the crust retains its shape while baking. Pie-weights are available as ceramic or metal beads, but rice, dried peas, lentils, beans or other pulses can be used instead. When using this method for a fully baked crust, the weights are removed before the pre-baking is complete in order to achieve a browned crust. Another technique dispenses with weights by placing a second pie tin on top of the crust, then inverting the tins to bake. In this method, the crust browns between the tins. A further simplified technique involves piercing the crust repeatedly with the tines of a fork to produce small holes, allowing steam to escape and preventing the crust from bubbling up, but that does not work with soft doughs such as pâte sucrée.

<text>Vincent Pallotti, SAC (21 April 1795 – 22 January 1850) was an Italian Catholic cleric and the founder of the Society of the Catholic Apostolate, later known as the Pious Society of Missions (the Pallottines). The original name was restored in 1947. He is buried in the Church of San Salvatore in Onda. He is considered the forerunner of Catholic Action. His feast day is 22 January.

==Biography==
Vincent Pallotti was born in Rome on 21 April 1795, to Pietro and Magdalena De Rossi Pallotti. He was descended from the noble families of the Pallotti of Norcia and the De Rossi of Rome. He was the uncle of Cardinal Luigi Pallotti (1829–1890).

His early studies were made at the Pious Schools of San Pantaleone, and from there he passed to the Roman College. At the age of sixteen, he resolved to become a priest, and was ordained on 16 May 1818. Shortly thereafter he earned a doctorate in theology. Pallotti is described as small of stature, slight of built, with big blue eyes and penetrating glance.

He was given an assistant professorship at the Sapienza University but resigned it soon after to devote himself to pastoral work. Pallotti worked selflessly looking after the poor in the urban areas of the city for most of his life. He organized schools for shoemakers, tailors, coachmen, carpenters, and gardeners so that they could better work at their trade, as well as evening classes for young farmers and unskilled workers. He soon became known as a &quot;second Saint Philip Neri&quot;. He once dressed up as an old woman to hear the confession of a man who threatened &quot;to kill the first priest who came through the door&quot;.

==Union of the Catholic Apostolate (UAC)==
On 9 January 1835, Pallotti found the Union of the Catholic Apostolate. He expressed his idea in the following words: &quot;The Catholic Apostolate, that is, the universal apostolate, which is common to all classes of people, consists in doing all that one must and can do for the great glory of God and for one’s own salvation and that of one’s neighbor.&quot; On 11 July 1835, Pope Gregory XVI gave his approval.

The Society was placed under the protection of Mary, Queen of Apostles. During the cholera plague in 1837, Pallotti ministered to the stricken. In 1838 the Society was ordered dissolved, as it was seen as a duplication of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. Pallotti appealed this decision to the pope and the order of dissolution was withdrawn.

On 28 October 2003, the Union of Catholic Apostolate was declared an International Public Association of the Faithful by a decree of the Pontifical Council for the Laity.

==Society of the Catholic Apostolate (SAC)==
In 1835 Pallotti formed the priests and brothers of the Union he called together into a community he called the &quot;Society of the Catholic Apostolate&quot;. However, as soon as Pallotti died in 1850 there was more trouble and presumably the original decree of dissolution was unearthed. When Pallotti&#x27;s last defender Cardinal Lambruscini died in 1854, the name of the Society was abruptly changed to &quot;The Pious Society of Missions&quot;. This lasted until 1947 when &quot;by a gracious act of the Holy See&quot; the original name of the society was restored.

He had an intense devotion to the mystery of the Most Blessed Trinity, and to the Virgin Mary. His contemporaries, including the pope, considered him a saint during his life.

Vincent Pallotti died in Rome, on 22 January 1850.

==Veneration== 

He was beatified by Pope Pius XII on 22 January 1950. He was canonized in 1963 by Pope John XXIII. On 6 April 1963, he was named principal patron of the Pontifical Missionary Union of Clergy.

When Pallotti&#x27;s body was exhumed in 1906 and 1950, examiners found his body to be incorrupt, a sign of holiness in the tradition of the Roman Catholic Church. His body is enshrined in the church of San Salvatore in Onda, in Rome, where it can be seen.

==Legacy==
Pallotti was deemed a patron of Vatican II for his efforts toward building unity in the church through such practices as inviting the people of his community to worship in the Roman parishes of Eastern Catholic Churches. 

His followers are the Pallottines, still operating internationally. They follow his motto, &quot;The love of Christ impels us&quot; (Caritas Christi Urget Nos). Members of the Society of the Catholic Apostolate work as everyday missionaries to &quot;renew faith and rekindle love.&quot; They work to fulfill the mission of their founder in the modern world. The Pallottines have major houses in Britain, Germany, New York, Poland, India, Ireland. Belize, and several other locations.

The Congregation of the Sisters of the Catholic Apostolate, commonly referred to as Pallottines, is an international community founded in Rome, Italy by Vincent Pallotti. The Pallottine Sisters trace their beginnings to the Pia Casa di Carità (Pious House of Charity) he established in Rome in 1838. This was a work dedicated to the religious and civil education of young girls who had been abandoned on the streets of Rome to procure food through begging. It is a work that is still operating today.

The Missionary Sisters of the Catholic Apostolate began in Germany as a response to the missionary needs in the Cameroons which were being administrated by the Pallottine Fathers.

During the Christmas Season, a nativity scene that Pallotti made himself is put on display at the Vatican, in the basilica&#x27;s square, before the Christmas tree. Pallotti promoted the celebration of the Octave of the Epiphany as an act of unity with his Orthodox brethren who celebrated Christmas on 6 January at that time.

<doc id="810371" wikidata="Q1815062" url="?curid=810371" title="Tanzhe Temple">
<text>The Tanzhe Temple () is a Buddhist temple situated in the Western Hills, a mountainous area in western Beijing. The temple is located near China National Highway 108 in Tanzhesi Town, Mentougou District, Beijing. At one time, it was one of the most important temples in China.

Built in the Jin Dynasty (266–420), it has an age of around 1,700 years. Tanzhe Temple is one of the oldest temples in Beijing. The area of the entire temple is 100 mu (6.8 hectares), and its arrangement of halls is akin to that found in the Ming and Qing dynasties.

==History==
Tanzhe Temple was first established in the 1st year of Yongjia period (307) in Western Jin dynasty (265-317) with the name of Jiafu Temple () and was later renamed Xiuyun Temple () by Kangxi Emperor (1662-1772) in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). But since there was a dragon pool behind the temple and mulberry trees in the mountain, so people always call it &quot;Tanzhe Temple&quot;. For the reason that it was first built earlier than Beijing city, so there is a saying that &quot;there comes first the Tanzhe Temple, then the Beijing city&quot; ().

Tanzhe Temple entered the most glorious period in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), four emperors, namely Kangxi Emperor (1662-1722), Yongzheng Emperor (1723-1735), Qianlong Emperor (1736-1795) and Jiaqing Emperor (1796-1820) all came to Tanzhe Temple to worship Buddha, which elevated its position and attracted more people to the temple.

==Architecture==
Most of the existing buildings in the temple are from the Ming and Qing dynasties, and there are pagodas from various historical periods such as the Jin, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. The over 900 rooms and 638 halls still maintain in the style of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and Qing dynasty (1644-1911). The two &quot;Emperor trees&quot; by the Hall of Three Sages were planted during the Liao Dynasty (907-1125) about 1,000 years ago.

The spacious and imposing buildings are arranged in three main northsouth axes. Along the central axis are the Archway, the shanmen, Deveraja Hall, Mahavira Hall and Vairochana Pavilion.

The temple&#x27;s central hall is its Mahavira Hall. in length, wide. Buddhist monks regularly perform religious ceremony here.

The temple is divided between the Hall of Abstinence, the Ordination Altar and the Hall of Guanyin. The latter has received fame because of its association with Princess Miaoyan, daughter of Kublai Khan. The princess is said to have entered nunnery here in the 13th century. The indentations can be found on the stone on which she always knelt and prayed within the hall. Supposedly she was also buried within the temple compound.

To the right of the main courtyard lies a separate yard containing stone monuments built in different styles over a period of several centuries and housing the remains of eminent monks.

===Mahavira Hall===
The Mahavira Hall has double-eave hip roofs () covered with yellow glazed titles, which symbolize a high level in Chinese architecture. Under the eaves is a plaque with the words &quot;Fuhai Zhulun&quot; (; Fuhai means the western paradise and Zhulun means a big ship.) written by Qianlong Emperor (1736-1795) in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). On each end of the main ridge is a giant glazed &quot;Chiwen&quot; with colorful glaze and vivid style. It was made in the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368). &quot;Chiwen&quot; is a legendary animal with a dragon head and fish tail. In the ancient time, people placed &quot;Chiwen&quot; at both ends of houses&#x27; main ridges to prevent water leakage, avoid fire and protect their family. It was said that when Kangxi Emperor (1662-1722) once came to Tanzhe Temple, he saw the &quot;Chiwen&quot; was going to leave, he ordered to build a long gilded chain and plug a sword to lock and prevent it from escaping.

===Yigan Pavilion===
The Yigan Pavilion (), also known as Liubei Pavilion (&#x27; Pavilion of Bestowing Wine). Its ground, which is made of white marble, is inscribed with twists and turns of the sinks winding and constituting a pattern of a dragon and a tiger. Springs spout out from the mouth of stone dragon waterway in the northeast corner of the pavilion and flow in the winding sinks. Visitors can sit in the pavilion and emulate ancient people&#x27;s custom of &quot;Qushui Liushang&quot; (a group people drink water from a winding canal with one wine cup floating on it) and enjoy the wine and poems composing.

===Pagoda Forest===
Tanzhe Temple has a large scale of tomb pagodas built near it. Now near 70 pagodas built in different dynasties are entirely preserved. They are of various types, such as stone column pagodas (), monolayer square pagodas (), dense-eave brick pagodas () and overturned-bowl shaped pagodas with Tibetan style ().

<doc id="810377" wikidata="Q3933944" url="?curid=810377" title="Spending Review">
<text>A spending review, or occasionally a comprehensive spending review, is a governmental process in the United Kingdom carried out by HM Treasury to set firm expenditure limits and, through public service agreements, define the key improvements that the public can expect from these resources.

Spending reviews typically focus upon one or several aspects of public spending while comprehensive spending reviews focus upon each government department&#x27;s spending requirements from a zero base (i.e. without reference to past plans or, initially, current expenditure). The latter are named after the year in which they are announced – thus &quot;CSR07&quot; (completed in October 2007) applies to financial years 2008–2011.

Other developed countries have similar review processes, e.g. Canada, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, and France. France conducted its first comprehensive spending review (called in French &quot;la Révision Générale des Politiques Publiques&quot;) in 2008. The Netherlands have been carrying out spending reviews since 1981.

As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 review covered just a one-year period in contrast to previous years. The 2021 spending review was subsumed into the October 2021 budget.

==2002 Spending Review==
The 2002 Spending Review (SR02) set a target for expanding the role of voluntary sector organisations in the provision of public services, anticipating growth by 5% in the period to 2005-06.

==2007 Comprehensive Spending Review==
The UK&#x27;s 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR07) included three significant changes. The first was that it represented the first test of the capacity of the Spending Review process to plan and deliver a discretionary fiscal consolidation in the UK. The previous four Spending Reviews had taken place during periods of steady public growth in the economy from 37% in 1999–00 to 42% by 2007–08. As both the UK&#x27;s then fiscal rules (the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; and the sustainable investment rule) began to bite, the UK government desired to halve the real rate of growth in public spending from 4% per annum over the last decade to 2% per annum over the next three years – a 0.5% below than the trend rate of growth of the economy. A second noteworthy development in the 2007 CSR was a marked extension in the certainty that the UK system provided to public sector managers about their future budgets. Finally, CSR07 saw the UK&#x27;s public service 110 largely departmental-based Public Service Agreements consolidated into 30 inter-departmental agreements. The review aimed to achieve savings of £35 billion.

During 2009, the National Audit Office undertook a series of reviews of departmentally-reported CSR07 value for money savings.

==2010 Spending Review==

A spending review for the years 2011/12 through to 2014/15 was announced by the coalition government. This review was driven by a desire to reduce government spending in order to cut the budget deficit.

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced the details of the spending review on 20 October 2010. The cuts were described as the biggest since World War II. The review led to an £81 billion cut in public spending in the following 4 years of the parliament, with average departmental cuts of 19%. In addition major changes in welfare were announced including £7 billion of extra welfare cuts, changes to incapacity benefit, housing benefit and tax credits and a rise in the state pension age to 66 from 2020. Public sector employees would face a £3.5 billion increase in public pension contributions.

The Home Office faced cuts of 25%, local councils would face a yearly 7% cut in funding from central government each year until 2014. The Ministry of Defence faced cuts of around 8%. DEFRA withdrew funding support from seven waste management PFI projects where least progress had been made with contract procurement and obtaining planning permission, on the basis that the UK’s 2020 landfill diversion targets set by the EU could still be met without the curtailed projects. The government argued that the withdrawal of funding credits reflected &quot;reasonable assumptions&quot;, and a legal challenge by Cheshire East and Cheshire West and Chester Councils against the DEFRA decision was unsuccessful. In addition many other public sector bodies saw cuts to their funding. Although not part of government, the BBC had its licence fee frozen for 6 years and took on the funding of the BBC World Service, BBC Monitoring and S4C.

The Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that the spending review led to a loss of about 490,000 public sector jobs by 2015. The NHS saw a 0.4% increase in spending in real terms over the following 4 years.

A £200 million payment was announced to compensate savers in the collapsed savings society Presbyterian Mutual.

A report published in late 2013 by Trust for London and the London School of Economics and Political Science estimated that local government budgets in London had taken a 33% real terms cut in central government funding for local government between 2009/10 and 2013/14.

==2015 Spending Review==
A spending review for the years 2016–17 to 2020-21 was announced by chancellor George Osborne alongside an Autumn Statement on 25 November 2015.

==2020 Spending Review==
Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his first spending review on 25 November 2020. In contrast to previous years, and as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the review covered a one-year period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022.

==2021 Spending Review==
The 2021 spending review (SR21) was subsumed into the October 2021 budget. SR21 set departmental resource and capital budgets from 2022-23 to 2024-25 and covered the devolved administrations&#x27; block grants for the same period of time. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt&#x27;s Autumn Statement of 17 November 2022 referred to the maintenance of committed budgets &quot;for the remaining two years of this Spending Review&quot;, and similarly his March 2024 budget speech was described as &quot;sticking to the plan&quot;.

==2024 Spending Review==
On 29 July 2024, and after Labour had won the 2024 general election, Chancellor Rachel Reeves launched a new multi-year spending review, noting that the Conservative government had not undertaken a spending review since 2001 (above) and that &quot;unfunded&quot; and &quot;undisclosed&quot; overspending of £21.9bn had created a need to make &quot;a necessary and urgent decision&quot; on government expenditure. She announced that spending reviews would now take place in alternating years, in each case with a minimum planning horizon looking three years ahead. The first phase of the Spending Review set the budgets for government departments for 2024-25 and 2025-26, while a second phase of the review, set to make further &quot;difficult choices&quot;, is scheduled for completion in spring 2025.

Among the decisions Reeves referred to in July 2024 were to remove winter fuel payments from pensioners not receiving pension credit (roughly around 10 million people), and to cancel several road and rail infrastructure projects. Shadow Chancellor Jeremy Hunt dismissed Reeves&#x27; claims as &quot;spurious&quot;, and argued that details of all government spending had been released by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

<text>The Crown Commercial Service (CCS) is an executive agency and trading fund of the Cabinet Office of the UK Government. The CCS is responsible for managing the procurement of common goods and services, increasing savings for the taxpayer by centralising buying requirements, and leading on procurement policy on behalf of the government.

==History==
CCS was originally created as the Buying Agency on 1 April 1991. On 1 April 2000, it became part of the newly established Office of Government Commerce (OGC) within HM Treasury. On 1 April 2001, the Buying Agency, the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, Property Advisors to the Civil Estate and other units from the Treasury merged to form OGCbuying.solutions. The agency&#x27;s name was changed to just Buying Solutions in April 2009. On 15 June 2010, it moved, along with its parent agency the OGC, to become part of the Efficiency and Reform Group within the Cabinet Office. Its name was changed to the Government Procurement Service (GPS) in July 2011.

In January 2014 the GPS merged with the procurement management from government departments to form the Crown Commercial Service (CCS). According to the service&#x27;s own data, CCS secured commercial benefits of £3.8billion in the financial year 2022/23.

==Operations==
CCS operates as a trading fund established under the Government Trading Funds Act 1973, as amended in 1990, with offices in Liverpool, Norwich, Newport, Leeds and London.

===Procurement services===
CCS provides professional procurement services to the public sector to enable organisations to deliver improved value for money in their commercial activities and provide professional support when it matters, advising on technical issues, energy-saving and environmental improvements.

CCS&#x27;s operations, and formerly those of GPS, include a range of framework agreements, which are a set of pre-tendered agreements with a range of suppliers from whom public sector customers can purchase goods and services. In the field of IT, historical examples of framework agreements include CITHS frameworks (commoditised IT hardware and software), ITHS (IT hardware and solutions), SPRINT II, Software Application Solutions, and Desktop21 for desktop computer services. The SPRINT II agreement offered pre-negotiated deals on computer hardware and software. Its use was mandated from 4 March 2011, amidst some controversy, for purchases by police authorities in England and Wales of commoditised ICT hardware and off-the-shelf software under government regulations issued in 2011. Claims were put forward during the currency of the agreement that supplies were more expensive via the Sprint ii route than through other sales channels, although the claims were later retracted. A current () example is the Crown Hosting Data Centres framework, which can be accessed by all central government departments, arm&#x27;s length bodies and the wider public sector. A small commission (typically less than 1%) is collected from the suppliers for each sale they make under these frameworks agreements.

===Procurement policy===
UK Government &quot;Procurement Policy Notes&quot; were in the past issued by CCS. These are now issued in the name of the Cabinet Office, but the CCS Helpdesk acts as the contact point for any queries. A separate series of &quot;Scottish Procurement Policy Notes&quot;, and a parallel series of &quot;Construction Policy Notes&quot; issued since 2017 aiming to alert Scottish contracting authorities &quot;to new policy, guidance and other matters relating to public sector construction&quot;, are published by the Scottish Government.

===Management of the Government Secure Intranet (GSi)===
As part of its support of the national government Internet infrastructure, CCS manages the UK&#x27;s Government Secure Intranet (GSi), including the entire third-level government domain .gsi.gov.uk and its sub-domains.

<doc id="810381" wikidata="Q3534850" url="?curid=810381" title="Tourism in Sri Lanka">
<text>Sri Lanka is a popular tourist destination. Tourism is a key industry that attracts international tourists yearly. Foreigners visit Sri Lanka to see nature, wildlife, historical monuments, and indigenous culture. In 2018, tourist arrivals peaked at 2.5 million, who spent a total of US$5.6 billion in the country. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused tourist numbers to decrease by 92% in 2020. As of 2022, tourist numbers have not rebounded from the pre-crisis high. The government is attempting to attract foreign investment in the country&#x27;s tourism industry, which began in earnest after the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009.

== Tourism ==

The government initiatives in the development of tourism date back to 1937 when the Ceylon Tourist Bureau was established. However, it was closed down in September 1939 due to World War II. After Sri Lanka&#x27;s independence the promotion of tourism was again considered by re-establishing the Ceylon Tourist Board which took over the function of the Tourist Bureau.

In 1965, J. R. Jayewardene as Minister of State initiated the first major development of the tourism industry with the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966 and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act No 14 of 1966, which formed the Ceylon Tourist Board and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation. Since then the Ceylon Tourist Board has functioned as the state agency, responsible for the development and promotion of the tourism sector in Sri Lanka. Ceylon Hotels Corporation paved the way for government investments to build hotels needed to attract tourists.

In October 2007 according to Section 2 of the Tourism Act No. 38 of 2005, the Sri Lanka Tourist Board (Act No 10 of 1966) was replaced by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA).

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has classified Sri Lanka into several resort regions suitable for tourism development:

* Colombo and Greater Colombo Resort Region: The Colombo and Greater Colombo Resort Region spreads along the Mount Lavinia in the south to Negombo in the north. Colombo city is the main part of the zone and is the centre for business activities, conferences and sports events in the country. Colombo serves as both a gateway and a stopover point for international tourists.
* South Coast Resort Region: The south coast zone extends from Wadduwa to Tissamaharama. The zone has been divided into two main regions. The first region extends from Wadduwa to Galle. Coastal areas like Kalutara, Beruwala, Bentota, Dedduwa, Madu Ganga, Balapitiya, Ahungalla, and Hikkaduwa are included in this region. The second region, extending from Galle to Tissamaharama, includes Unawatuna, Koggala, Weligama, Mirissa, Matara, Tangalle and Hambantota areas as sub-points of the zone.
* East Coast Resort Region: The East Coast Resort Region extends from Kuchchaveli in the north to Pottuvil in the south. The main tourism zones in this region are Arugam Bay, Pasikudah, Trincomalee and Nilaveli.
* West Coast Resort Region: The West Coast Resort Region extends along Kalpitiya, Marawila and Waikkala areas.
* High Country Resort Region: Nuwara Eliya, Bandarawela and Maskeliya are included for the High Country Resort Region.
* Ancient Cities Resort Region: This region has five world heritage sites, namely Anuradhapura, Dambulla, Kandy, Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya. Other regions include Habarana, Giritale, Matale and Victoria.
* Other Resort Regions: This includes Yala, Udawalawa, Wasgamuwa, Pinnawala, and Ratnapura, Knuckles Range area.

=== Shared Tourism with India ===

In the past, ferry services between India and Sri Lanka for tourists have been introduced and suspended repeatedly because of their low usage. The low usage of the old ferry services could be due to the high cost of the former services. As of now, the only way for tourists to access India from Sri Lanka is by air. In 2019 negotiations about ferry services between Colombo and Tuticorin and between Talaimannar and Rameshwaram began. There is also a proposal to operate a cruise/ferry service between Colombo and Kochi in Kerala. The Indian and Sri Lankan governments are working closely together to connect the two neighbouring countries better. The Sri Lankan minister of Tourism Development John Amaratunga indicated that ferry service will help tourists from both sides to travel at a very low cost.

== History ==

When the government decided to develop the tourism sector as a separate sector of the country&#x27;s economy by establishing the Ceylon Tourist Bureau in 1966, there were 18,969 foreign tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka. There was an upward trend of tourist arrivals until 1982, with the exception of 1971. Between 1976 and 1982, tourist arrivals had increased by 24% per year. The tourist traffic in 1982 showed that there was a remarkable growth in the number of tourists, with 407,230 arrivals. However, with the beginning of the civil war in 1983, the growth of tourist arrivals declined and stagnated to around 300,000 – 500,000 arrivals annually.

The civil war that had lasted over 25 years ended in 2009 as LTTE separatists were defeated by government forces. In 2009 the tourist arrivals numbered 448,000, and in 2015, 1,798,380, showing over 300% growth in six years.

There is a significant domestic tourist segment, most commonly for family holidays, pilgrimages, and general sightseeing. In 2014 six million Sri Lankans travelled within the country as domestic tourists. The main destinations of domestic tourists are Anuradhapura, Kataragama, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Sri Pada, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya and Dambulla. Domestic tourism is noticeable during school vacations and on weekends.


Sri Lanka reopened for tourism in January 2021 under a health protocol involving pre-flight and post-arrival tests for Coronavirus. Tourists could visit a series of designated locations under &#x27;bio bubble&#x27; concept avoiding contact with locals and stay at a number of certified hotels. An updated list was made available at the Sri Lanka Tourism promotion authority website section &#x27;Hello Again&#x27;. Prior to the official opening, a controversy erupted over tourists brought from Ukraine by a former Ambassador to Russia, where health protocols were breached. It was later described as a pilot project. The first tourists after the COVID-19 closure arrived in Ukraine&#x27;s SkyUp Airlines at Mattala Airport on December 28 as part of the so-called pilot project. In January and February 2021 Sri Lanka welcomed 5,048 tourists, down from 435,941 in 2020, before airports closed in March.

=== Visitor statistics ===
Most visitors arriving in Sri Lanka on a short-term basis were from the following countries:

== Attractions ==
Tourist attractions are classifiable as natural or anthropogenic. Natural attractions include nature spots, flora and fauna, and places with a pleasant climate. Geotourism sites may also be included in this category. Anthropogenic attractions include archaeological and cultural attractions, historical and religion sites, performing arts and folklore, handicrafts and artifacts.

=== Wildlife ===
Despite its small size, Sri Lanka possesses a high level of biodiversity and wildlife resources and is rated among the 34 biodiversity hotspots in the world. Many species of flora and fauna are indigenous to Sri Lanka. This has made the island a country with the highest rates of biological endemism in the world.

Forbes ranked Sri Lanka as one of top wildlife safaris outside of Africa, due to the actual presence of five charismatic megafauna (The Big Five) and the relative ease of seeing them during a single tour itinerary. The Leopard, the Asian elephant and Sloth Bear are found in several national parks. The Yala National Park has one of the highest concentrations of leopards in the world. Wildlife photographer and author Gehan de Silva Wijeyeratne has shown that Sri Lanka is the best place in the world to spot Blue whales. A narrow continental shelf off Mirissa, Sri Lanka allows Blue and Sperm whales to swim close to the shore. Seasonally, the largest gathering of Asian elephants numbering 200-300 or higher takes place at the Minneriya National Park.

Thirteen percent of Sri Lanka&#x27;s land surface has been designated as Wildlife Protected Areas (WLPAs), which at present exceed a total area of . Approximately 7% of the area is national parks, the areas allowed for the public to see and study wildlife. Sri Lanka&#x27;s national parks have become popular tourist destinations.
=== Beaches ===
Sri Lanka possesses nearly coastlines with tropical beaches which are popular among both local and foreign tourists. Most of the coastlines of the country are studded with varying coastal features such as bays, lagoons, sandbanks, and rocky headlands. Marine recreation activities, such as sea bathing and swimming, surfing, boating, snorkelling, deep-sea fishing, underwater photography, and scuba diving, can be seen at most of these beaches and related resort areas. Beaches at Tangalle, Beruwala, Mirissa, Bentota, Unawatuna, Arugam Bay, Pasikudah, Hikkaduwa, Uppuveli and Negombo are considered as famous tourist beaches in the country.Coconut Tree Hill is a popular tourist attraction in Mirissa Beach and one of the most Instagrammed locations in Sri Lanka.

=== Natural scenic beauty ===
Sri Lanka has numerous tourist attractions with areas of natural scenic beauty, primarily including mountainous terrains, agricultural landscapes, waterfalls, places with diverse climatic conditions, reservoirs (wewas), and rivers.
=== Botanical/zoological gardens ===

The country has six botanical gardens and four Zoological gardens. The botanical gardens are maintained by the Department of National Botanical Gardens, and the zoological gardens are maintained by the Department of National Zoological Gardens. The gardens have become attractive places among local and foreign visitors.

=== Bird Watching ===
Sri Lanka is home to 26 endemic-bird species and seven proposed endemic species. The total number of bird species recorded in the island is 492 of which 219 are breeding residents. Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka, commonly abbreviated FOGSL, is the Sri Lankan affiliate of BirdLife International. It was founded in 1976 to promote the conservation of birds and preservation of the environment. FOGSL headquarters are situated in the Department of Zoology, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Identifying and proposing Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka is one of the main activities of the group. From 2008, Field Ornithology Group conducts a bird count in December in the lines of Christmas Bird Count by the National Audubon Society of the United States. Sri Lanka&#x27;s location at the tip of the Indian subcontinent has made the island a termination point in the north–south bird migratory route.

The small grants programme of the United Nations Development Programme granted the Field Ornithology Group 20,308.00 for printing of selected publications and other activities. As part of their educational programmes, Field Ornithology Group has published many books and posters, not only on birds but also mammals and wetlands. The FOGSL also publish two periodicals, &quot;Kedetta&quot; in Sinhala and &quot;Malkoha&quot; in English.

=== Heritage ===

Heritage tourism involves visiting historical sites. Sri Lanka is very rich in pre-historic, proto-historic, and historic monuments, which bespeak its ancient civilization and culture. Mainly Buddhism has influenced in the moulding of the cultural heritage of the country. The historic period of Sri Lanka proper starts circa 236 B.C. with the introduction of Buddhism to the country by the missionaries sent by the Indian empire Asoka.

The UNESCO has declared six archaeological and two ecological World Heritage Sites in the country. Beside the world heritage sites the government of Sri Lanka has declared a number of archaeological protected sites and monuments within the country.


=== Pilgrimage ===

Sri Lanka is well known for its rich Buddhist culture as well as other religions. Being a religious country, Sri Lanka has many places with religious and historic significance, which attract tourists from all over the world. Anuradhapura, Temple of the Tooth, Adam&#x27;s Peak, Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu and Kataragama, are a few famous religious sites on the island that attract a large number of tourists.

The foot pilgrimage called &quot;Pada Yatra&quot;, which is one of Sri Lanka&#x27;s oldest traditions, has been practised for centuries, where the local people from Jaffna come along the East Coast to Kataragama shrine.
=== Sports and adventure ===
Sports tourism is defined as either people being involved in, observing or participating in a particular sporting event for leisure. Sri Lanka is also a destination for sports such as cricket, rugby, golf and surfing. Except for cricket, the contribution to the tourism sector from other sports is still at a very low level. Apart from mainstream sports events, adventure sports are also included in sports tourism. Trekking, hiking, diving, rock climbing, deep sea fishing, whale watching, kitesurfing and hot air ballooning are some of the adventure sports those can be found in Sri Lanka.
=== Culture and other ===
Cultural tourism includes tourism in urban areas, particularly historic or large cities and their cultural facilities such as museums and theatres.

Museums and theatres – Currently four national museums and 26 archaeological museums have been established in Sri Lanka. National museums are maintained by the Department of National Museums and archaeological museums by the Department of Archaeology. Besides the museums, a large number of theatres also can be found in Sri Lanka.

Festivals – Sri Lanka is a multi-cultural country with several different festivals celebrated by various communities. The Kandy Esala Perahera, Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations, Vesak Festival, Christmas, Ramadan festival, Thai Pongal, and the Galle Literary Festival are a few of the major festivals.

Performing arts – There are three main traditional dance forms in Sri Lanka: Kandyan dancing, low country dancing, and Sabaragamuwa dancing. Though not unique to Sri Lanka, &#x27;Bharatanatyam&#x27;, which originated from India is also popular in Sri Lanka, particularly among the Tamil community.

Food – The cuisine of Sri Lanka has been influenced by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Rice is the main staple diet of the country. Other staples include hoppers, string hoppers, and pittu.

Being one of the largest producers of tea in the world Sri Lanka is best known for the production of unorthodox tea. Tea was introduced to the country by the British who called the country &quot;Ceylon&quot;. Pure Ceylon tea is considered some of the finest tea produced anywhere in the world.

Handicrafts – Handicrafts available in Sri Lanka include wood carving, silverware, brass castings, ceramic ware, bamboo products, pottery, batiks, lace works, cane works, costume jewellery, lacquerware, wooden masks, coir goods, handlooms, and ivory products.
== Accommodations ==
Tourist accommodations in Sri Lanka consist of graded hotels, supplementary establishments, guest houses and limited-scale camping sites. More informal accommodation is available on a paying guest system in private houses and hill-country tea estate bungalows.

== Earnings ==
The tourist industry makes a significant contribution to the national economy by directly contributing to the government budget, foreign exchange earnings and employment generation. It contributes both directly and indirectly, in the provision of goods and services to the tourist sector.

== Social and environmental impacts ==
Tourism in Sri Lanka, despite its generate Income to the economy, It had received some critics. The high biodiversity of Sri Lanka seems to be threatened by the development of mass tourism which has already affected several natural reserves. Some endangered animal species seem to be seriously threatened by the rise of tourism in some areas; that is the case with the Keerthisinghe&#x27;s Rock Frog, which is endemic in Sri Lanka.

An alternative kind of tourism, called ecotourism, sustainable tourism or responsible tourism, enables travellers to participate in tourism throughout Sri Lanka while contributing to the well-being of the local communities and making sure their environmental impact is limited. The Sri Lanka Ecotourism Foundation is the national organization that created an official ecotourism network through the island, allowing to develop sustainable tourism with wide options of travel. In 2010, the foundation won the presidential award for &quot;Outstanding Contribution to Tourism in Sri Lanka&quot;.

== Elephants in tourism ==

Elephant trekking, or elephant riding is a significant attraction for tourists coming to visit Sri Lanka. It is traditionally seen as a way of getting closer to nature, often taking place in sanctuaries and orphanages. The largest orphanage in Sri Lanka is Pinnawala, which, as of 2023, houses more than 90 elephants.

Since their wild instincts remain, elephants must be broken and controlled to be able to work, be around humans, and give rides. One of the traditional methods used by the tourism industry is the &#x27;phajaan&#x27;, also known as elephant crushing or &#x27;breaking the elephant&#x27;s spirit&#x27;. A report by Born Free in 2007 into Pinnawala, revealed questionable animal welfare standards including: chaining male elephants during &#x27;musth&#x27; causing wounds to the legs and training elephants with the threat of pain from an &#x27;ankus&#x27;.

During elephant trekking experiences, other concerns include the use of howdahs, which combined with the weight of a tourist, can cause agonising and permanent spinal damage. Additionally, high tourist demand for elephant trekking means that elephants may also be forced to work long hours in hot and humid conditions.

=== Laws and Regulations ===
In September 2021, the Sri Lankan government introduced new animal protection laws. These measures included strict regulation around working with elephants, mandated daily two-and-a-half-hour bath for each animal, required all animals to have new photo identity cards, and to have a medical check-up every six months, among other provisions. Those who fail to comply could be charged with three years in prison, with their elephants taken into state care.

However, pundits argued that the law had loopholes which could still be exploited. According to the former president of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society, Rukshan Jayawardena, the law &quot;[legitimised] the ownership of 30 to 40 elephant that were kidnapped from the wild, mostly between 2010 and 2015&quot;.

Whilst there has been sufficient local legislation to stop the illegal capture and trade of Asian Elephants in Sri Lanka, research has found that effort to stop these illicit activities have been hampered due to corruption among wildlife officers, politicians, clergymen and military personnel.

<text>The Smaky is a line of mostly 8-bit personal computers and accompanying operating system developed by Professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and others at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland beginning in 1974. The computers were used at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and in Swiss schools. The names derives from SMArt KeYboard, reflecting the form factor that contained a compact motherboard which fit within the same housing as the keyboard.

==History==
The first three models, Smaky 1, Smaky 2, and Smaky 4, were based on the Intel 8080 microprocessor (Smaky 3 was a prototype that was never completed). In 1978, the Smaky switched to using the 8-bit Zilog Z80 processor. A portable Smaky was made during this period, which resembled Osborne portable computers.

In 1981, the platform again changed to the 32-bit Motorola 68000 processor. A new operating system was written, called Psos, which was developed specifically for the Smaky, and used on all subsequent models.
Development work on the Smaky hardware ended with the Smaky 400 in 1997. The Smaky 400 was a PCI board hosting a Motorola 68040 processor, designed to work together with a terminal emulation software running under Windows NT. It helped Smaky users switch from their desktop Smaky to an Intel PC, while preserving access to applications and documents.

==Legacy==
A Smaky emulator for Microsoft Windows was developed in 1998, replacing the need for the Smaky 400 hardware. It was named the Smaky Infini (French for &quot;infinite&quot;), since its performance and lifespan were no longer being limited by hardware, it was based on the UAE emulator, merged into the Smaky 400 terminal emulation software.

<doc id="810385" wikidata="Q3558387" url="?curid=810385" title="Funarg problem">
<text>In computer science, the funarg problem &quot;(function argument problem)&quot; refers to the difficulty in implementing first-class functions (functions as first-class objects) in programming language implementations so as to use stack-based memory allocation of the functions.

The difficulty only arises if the body of a nested function refers directly (i.e., not by argument passing) to identifiers defined in the environment in which the function is defined, but not in the environment of the function call. A standard resolution is either to forbid such references or to create closures.

There are two subtly different versions of the funarg problem. The upwards funarg problem arises from returning (or otherwise transmitting &quot;upwards&quot;) a function from a function call. The downwards funarg problem arises from passing a function as a parameter to another function call.

==Upwards funarg problem==
When one function calls another during a typical program&#x27;s execution, the local state of the caller (including parameters and local variables) must be preserved in order for execution to proceed after the callee returns. In most compiled programs, this local state is stored on the call stack in a data structure called a &quot;stack frame&quot; or &quot;activation record&quot;. This stack frame is pushed, or allocated, as prelude to calling another function, and is popped, or deallocated, when the other function returns to the function that did the call. The upwards funarg problem arises when the calling function refers to the called/exited function&#x27;s state after that function has returned. Therefore, the stack frame containing the called function&#x27;s state variables must not be deallocated when the function returns, violating the stack-based function call paradigm.

One solution to the upwards funarg problem is to simply allocate all activation records from the heap instead of the stack and rely on some form of garbage collection or reference counting to deallocate them when they are no longer needed. Managing activation records on the heap has historically been perceived to be less efficient than on the stack (although this is partially contradicted) and has been perceived to impose significant implementation complexity. Most functions in typical programs (less so for programs in functional programming languages) do not create upwards funargs, adding to concerns about potential overhead associated with their implementation. Furthermore, this approach is genuinely difficult in languages that do not support garbage collection.

Some efficiency-minded compilers employ a hybrid approach in which the activation records for a function are allocated from the stack if the compiler is able to deduce, through static program analysis, that the function creates no upwards funargs. Otherwise, the activation records are allocated from the heap.

Another solution is to simply copy the value of the variables into the closure at the time the closure is created. This will cause a different behavior in the case of mutable variables, because the state will no longer be shared between closures. But if it is known that the variables are constant, then this approach will be equivalent. The ML languages take this approach, since variables in those languages are bound to values—i.e. variables cannot be changed. Java also takes this approach with respect to anonymous classes (and lambdas since Java 8), in that it only allows one to refer to variables in the enclosing scope that are effectively codice_1 (i.e. constant).

Some languages allow the programmer to explicitly choose between the two behaviors. PHP 5.3&#x27;s anonymous functions require one to specify which variables to include in the closure using the codice_2 clause; if the variable is listed by reference, it includes a reference to the original variable; otherwise, it passes the value. In Apple&#x27;s Blocks anonymous functions, captured local variables are by default captured by value; if one wants to share the state between closures or between the closure and the outside scope, the variable must be declared with the codice_3 modifier, in which case that variable is allocated on the heap.

===Example===
The following Haskell-like pseudocode defines function composition:

codice_4 is the operator for constructing a new function, which in this case has one argument, codice_5, and returns the result of first applying codice_6 to codice_5, then applying codice_8 to that. This λ function carries the functions codice_8 and codice_6 (or pointers to them) as internal state.

The problem in this case exists if the compose function allocates the parameter variables codice_8 and codice_6 on the stack. When codice_13 returns, the stack frame containing codice_8 and codice_6 is discarded. When the internal function codice_16 attempts to access codice_6, it will access a discarded memory area.

==Downwards funarg problem==
A downwards funarg may also refer to a function&#x27;s state when that function is not actually executing. However, because, by definition, the existence of a downwards funarg is contained in the execution of the function that creates it, the stack frame for the function can usually still be stored on the stack. Nonetheless, the existence of downwards funargs implies a tree structure of closures and stack frames that can complicate human and machine reasoning about the program state.

The downwards funarg problem complicates the efficient compilation of tail calls and code written in continuation-passing style. In these special cases, the intent of the programmer is (usually) that the function run in limited stack space, so the &quot;faster&quot; behavior may actually be undesirable.

==Practical implications==
Historically, the upwards funarg problem has proven to be more difficult. For example, the Pascal programming language allows functions to be passed as arguments but not returned as results; thus implementations of Pascal are required to address the downwards funarg problem but not the upwards one. The Modula-2 and Oberon programming languages (descendants of Pascal) allow functions both as parameters and return values, but the assigned function may not be a nested function. The C programming language historically avoids the main difficulty of the funarg problem by not allowing function definitions to be nested; because the environment of every function is the same, containing just the statically allocated global variables and functions, a pointer to a function&#x27;s code describes the function completely. Apple has proposed and implemented a closure syntax for C that solves the upwards funarg problem by dynamically moving closures from the stack to the heap as necessary. The Java programming language deals with it by requiring that context used by nested functions in anonymous inner and local classes be declared codice_18, and context used by lambda expressions be effectively final. C# and D have lambdas (closures) that encapsulate a function pointer and related variables.

In functional languages, functions are first-class values that can be passed anywhere. Thus, implementations of Scheme or Standard ML must address both the upwards and downwards funarg problems. This is usually accomplished by representing function values as heap-allocated closures, as previously described. The OCaml compiler employs a hybrid technique (based on static program analysis) to maximize efficiency.

<text>Vis () is a small Croatian island in the Adriatic Sea. It is the farthest inhabited island off the Croatian mainland. Before the end of World War I, the island was held by the Liburnians, the Republic of Venice, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, and the Austrian Empire. During the 19th century, the sea to the north of Vis was the site of two naval battles. In 1920, the island was ceded to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as part of the Treaty of Rapallo. During World War II, the island was the headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisan movement. After the war, Vis was used as a naval base for the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army until 1989. The island&#x27;s main industries are viticulture, fishing, fish processing, and tourism.

==Geography==

The farthest inhabited island off the Croatian mainland, Vis had a population of 3,313 in 2021. Vis has an area of . Its highest point is Hum, which is above sea level. The island&#x27;s two largest settlements are the town of Vis on the island&#x27;s eastern side (the settlement for which the island was originally named) and Komiža on its western coast.

==Environment==
Vis, along with Brusnik, Sveti Andrija and the neighbouring islet of Kamnik, Biševo, Jabuka and the Palagruža archipelago, forms part of the Croatian Offshore Islands Important Bird Area (IBA). This was designated as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant breeding populations of Scopoli&#x27;s and Yelkouan shearwaters, as well as of Eleonora&#x27;s falcons.

==History==
===Ancient history===

Vis was inhabited by the time of the Neolithic period. In the 4th century BC, the Greek tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius the Elder, founded the colony &quot;Issa&quot; () on the island. A town on an island of the same name was settled by Illyrians, who were under the domination of Liburni from the 8th to the 6th centuries B.C. At the beginning of the 4th century B.C. the island was colonized by Syracusan Greeks as part of a plan of Dionysios the Elder to control the Adriatic.

During the 3rd century Issa founded the emporia Tragurion (Traù, now Trogir) and Epetion (Stobreč) on the Illyrian mainland. Its predominance in the region lasted until the first Illyro-Roman war 229-219 B.C. when it became a pawn in the battles of greater powers. In the civil war it sided with Pompey and consequently lost its privileges and autonomy in 47 B.C. when it was reduced to the rank of an &quot;oppidum civium Romanorum&quot; and was dependent on the newly founded colony at Salona. As a polis, Issa minted its own money, and these coins of many types had wide circulation. The town, situated on a slope on the W side of a large bay, was defended by strong Hellenistic walls, still visible in an irregular quadrangle (265 x 360 m) that enclosed an area of 9.8 ha. The street grid and foundations of houses have been found.

The necropolis has yielded many pieces of pottery, including some from South Italy. The wall of the cavea of the theater, built in the Roman period, is incorporated into the present Franciscan Monastery. It could seat about 3000 persons. Inscriptions, statues, coins, and pottery are preserved in the archaeological museums at Split and Zagreb. Later, it became an independent polis, and even minted its own money and founded its own colonies, the most notable of which was Aspálathos (the modern-day city of Split).

In the 1st century BC, the island was held by the Liburnians.

===Under Venice===
Until 1797, the island was under the rule of the Republic of Venice. During this time large settlements developed along the coastline (Comisa (now Komiža) and Lissa (now Vis)). Administratively, the island of Lissa was for centuries bound to the island of Lesina, now named Hvar. The Venetian influence is still recognizable in architecture found on the island. The dialect of Croatian spoken on the island – called Cokavian – is recognized by the Croatian government as intangible cultural heritage and is notable for a large vocabulary of Venetian origin.

===Long 19th century===
After the short-lived Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, with Italian as the official language, the island was ruled by the Austrian Empire from 1814. In official Austrian (Habsburg) administration, as with other places in Dalmatia up until 1909, it maintained its Italian name of &quot;Lissa&quot;, In the Austrian census of 1910, out of 10,107 inhabitants (10,041 citizens), 9,939 responded that their language is Croatian (98.9%), with just 92 declared to be Italian-speakers (0.9%). After the end of World War I, it was under Italian occupation in the period from 1918 to 1921, before it was ceded to Kingdom of Yugoslavia as part of the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo.

The sea to the north of the island was the location of two battles:
*on 13 March 1811, a small Royal Navy squadron under the command of Captain William Hoste, defeated a larger French squadron in the Battle of Lissa (1811)
*on 20 July 1866, the smaller Austrian fleet, under Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, attacked the Italian fleet, under Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, defeating the larger Italian force and sinking the in the Battle of Lissa (1866).

===Second World War===
Vis was at one point the site of the general headquarters of Marshal Josip Broz Tito, the leader of the Yugoslav Partisan resistance movement. It was occupied by Italy between 1941 and 1943, then was liberated by the Partisans and reinforced by the British 2nd Commando Brigade. At the end of World War II the island returned to Yugoslavia. During the war the island was mined. Allied fighter planes were based at a small airfield that was also used for emergency landings of Allied bombers, including an American B-24 flown by George McGovern. No. 6 Squadron RAF extensively used the airfield as a forward operating base, flying Hawker Hurricane Mk IV fighter aircraft, from May 1944 to February 1945.

During World War II, a crate of the Armed Services Editions of paperback books was dropped by parachute along with other supplies on to Vis Island off the coast of Yugoslavia. The books were then read aloud to the partisans by English speaking soldiers who translated the books as they read them.

Early in July 1944, the novelist Evelyn Waugh flew with Randolph Churchill from Bari, Italy, to Vis as part of the British military mission to Yugoslavia. There they met Marshal Tito. Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.

During WWII the island was also home to 1435 Squadron of the RAF flying Mark IX Spitfires in ground support of allied troops fighting in Italy.

===After 1945===
After the war, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army used the island as one of its main naval bases until abandoning the base in 1989. After Croatia became independent in 1991, its navy did not reclaim most of the facilities, and the many abandoned buildings are being used for civilian purposes and tourism, including tunnels, bunkers and a secret submarine base. In 2008, 34 mines left over from World War II were cleared from the island.

In 2017 the movie &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot; was filmed on location on Vis.

In 2019 GEOPARK Vis archipelago became a member of UNESCO Global Geoparks.

==Administration==
Vis town and Komiža are seats of separate administrative municipalities which cover the entire island and nearby islets, which are both part of Split-Dalmatia County.

==Economy==
The island&#x27;s main industries are agriculture (mainly viticulture), fishing, fish processing, and tourism.

Around 20% of the island&#x27;s arable land is covered with vineyards. Autochthonous vine species cultivated on the island are Plavac Mali, Kurteloška, and Vugava. Vugava is autochthonous variety of wine of island Vis.

The sea around Vis is rich with fish, especially blue fish (sardine, mackerel and anchovy). Komiža fishermen of the 16th century developed their own type of fishing boat, the falkuša, which was used until the second half of the 20th century because of its excellent features.

== Access ==
Vis is accessed only by boat from Split. Jadrolinija services the island using mainly the ro-ro ferry MT &quot;Petar Hektorović&quot;, with a scheduled voyage time of 2 hours and 20 minutes. There is also a high-speed passenger catamaran service Split–Milna–Hvar–Vis provided by Jadrolinija which takes 1 hour and 30 minutes. During the summer season (from 31 May – 29 September), the ferry and high-speed catamaran prices are higher.

There used to be direct ship lines to Italy during summer season. In 2010 Termoli Jet started Termoli-Vis-Split line, taking 3h30&#x27; to reach Vis from Italian city of Termoli. In 2015, Blue Line ran the now cancelled night ferry service Ancona-Vis. 

In 2016, now-defunct European Coastal Airlines tried establishing seaplane passenger service Split-Vis, which took some 15 minutes.

<text>The Centrobasket is a FIBA-sponsored international basketball tournament where national teams from Central America and the Caribbean participate. These countries make up the Central American and Caribbean Basketball Confederation (CONCENCABA). The top three or four Women&#x27;s National teams typically earn berths to the FIBA Women&#x27;s AmeriCup, from which they can qualify for the FIBA Basketball World Cup or Summer Olympics. Teams qualify for these tournaments by finishing high (usually first or second place) in the previous Centrobasket or by placing high at the FIBA COCABA Championship for Mexico and the seven Central American countries and at the FIBA CBC Championship for the 23 Caribbean countries. In total, 31 countries have an opportunity to qualify their national teams for Centrobasket, yet all of them do not enter teams regularly.

==History==
Celebration of the tournament typically is every two years. Initially played only in odd years, the tournament has, in recent years, it has moved to even years since 2004. The tournament was not held in either 1979 or 1983, but with those exceptions, the tournament has been held every other year, excepting for subsequent tournaments in 2003 and 2004.

Eight teams participate at the tournament, divided into two groups. The first round of the tournament consists of a round-robin, and then, in the second round, teams compete to define their final position at the tournament&#x27;s standing.

Panama and Puerto Rico have been multiple medal winners at this event, both considered the strongest teams in the region, even though the Puerto Rican team almost never sends its best players for this competition (it mostly sends its second team). To date, Puerto Rico has earned large number of medals in every tournament that it has participated in.

<text>Vis is a town on the eponymous island in the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. Its population was 1,934 . The town is the seat of the eponymous Vis municipality, one of the island&#x27;s two municipalities (the other being Komiža). Both belong administratively to Split-Dalmatia County.

==History==
Vis, on the Illyrian coast, was established in the 4th century BCE as an Ancient Greek polis Issa, a colony of Syracuse, Sicily (which in turn was a colony of Corinth). Dionysius the Elder, the contemporary tyrant of Syracuse, founded the colony Issa to control shipping in the Adriatic Sea. Ancient Issa developed as the urban and economic center of the Dalmatian coasts, and it also served as a military base. The city established several colonies, such as Aspálathos, modern-day Split (now the largest city in Dalmatia), Epidauros (Cavtat), and Tragurion (Trogir). Issa functioned as an independent polis until the 1st century BCE, when it was conquered by the Roman Empire. Following the Roman conquest, Issa lost its significance until the late Middle Ages, when it was mentioned in several historical sources.

Until 1797, the island was under the rule of the Republic of Venice. Administratively, the island of Lissa was for centuries bound to the island of Lesina, now named Hvar. Under the Treaty of Pressburg, control of the Dalmatian coast and islands passed to the short-lived Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, with Italian the official language on the island. From 1809 until the end of the Napoleonic Wars the town was occupied by Britain, then ceded to the Austrian Empire from 1815. It maintained its Italian name of Lissa. After the end of World War I, it was under Italian rule again in the period from 1918 to 1921, according to the provisions of the 1915 Treaty of London, before it was ceded to Kingdom of Yugoslavia as part of the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo. Vis was the site of the general headquarters of Marshal Josip Broz Tito, the leader of the Yugoslav Partisan resistance movement during World War II. After the war, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army used the island as one of its main naval bases until abandoning the base in 1989.

==Geography==
The town of Vis is in a relatively large and protected bay (, English: &quot;Bay of Saint George&quot;) on the island&#x27;s northeast side, facing the island of Hvar and the Dalmatian mainland. The port of Vis is in the southwest part of the bay. The port is protected from the open sea&#x27;s influence by the islet Host (named after William Hoste) and the peninsula Prirovo (sometimes spelled &quot;Prilovo&quot;). Other, smaller ports are in Kut and Stonca, which are also parts of the town of Vis.

Vis is separated from its hinterlands (&quot;Dračevo polje&quot; and &quot;Velo polje&quot;) by 250–300 m high hills which are important for local residents as the main source of income from viticulture. Other official parts of the town are villages on the bays of the south and southeast coast, such as Milna, Rukavac, Srebrna, Stiniva, Stončica, some of which show signs of developing into new towns. Besides Vis itself, these bays and villages are the island&#x27;s main source of tourist income.

==Climate==
Vis experiences warm and temperate winters with warm to hot summers. The landward breeze makes it the most moderate climate in Croatia. The climate allows for tropical and Mediterranean vegetation, including palms, carobs, olives, grapes and lemons. The average rainfall is about . The island of Vis has a number of natural sources of drinking water from natural spring water reservoirs. It is also home to 12 distinct types of island vegetation. The World Organization for Environmental Protection has named Vis one of the 10 environmentally best-preserved islands in the Mediterranean.

==Administration==
The official area of the town of Vis is the entire eastern half of the island. The western half is under the authority of Komiža.

The town council consists of eleven councilors divided into three groups; five from the SDP - HNS - HSS coalition, three from the &quot;Independent List of Ante Acalinović&quot; and three from the HDZ - HSP coalition. Ascendancy is currently held by HDZ - HSP coalition in alliance with the &quot;Independent List&quot;. The current city major is Ivo Radica.

==Population==
In the 2011 census, the Vis municipality was composed of the following settlements:
* Dračevo Polje, population 13
* Marinje Zemlje, population 63
* Milna, population 30
* Plisko Polje, population 19
* Podselje, population 19
* Podstražje, population 40
* Rogačić, population 12
* Rukavac, population 66
* Vis, population 1,672

==Economy==
Until the middle of the twentieth century, the main sources of income were vineyards and wine production. In recent times, more and more people have been working in tourism. The town is also famous for the greenery of its palms, the only example on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea.

== Notable residents ==
* Niko pl. Giaxa (Jakša) (1845–1905), first national major of Vis
* Ivan Farolfi (1892–1945), high-ranked official and former mayor;
* Vesna Parun (1922–2010), acclaimed Croatian poet who was born in Zlarin but spent her childhood in Vis;

== Monuments and historical sites ==

The Church of Our Lady of Spilice was named after smaller semi-caves that were on the site where it was built. Construction began on the land donated by Frano de Pelegrinis at the very beginning of the 16th century. According to archive documentation, the church was still unfinished in 1521, and the builders had increased its dimensions during construction, evidenced in various styles over time: Gothic, Renaissance and baroque. Its oldest part, in the central area, was built in the first half of the 16th century and shows the transition from Gothic to Renaissance style. The main door has fluted doorjambs upon which two semi-capitals support the transom. Above the door is a simple, well-defined semicircular lunette adorned with pinions. The rounded window of the façade is of the Renaissance period, whilst an attenuate distaff with three bells is the highest in Dalmatia. The church&#x27;s naves are entered through two baroque doors over which are double-winged pediments and above them rounded windows. The church&#x27;s interior is divided by broad semicircular arches on masonry pillars into three naves. With this, the unity of the space was achieved, illuminated by the long, narrow windows of the Gothic exterior, of which some were transferred from the old walls which dated back to the 16th century. The posterior part of the church was also enlarged with a baroque shrine, the chapel of St. Vicko and a sacristy. The altar polyptych was created by the famous Venetian painter Girolamo da Santacroce.

The late baroque Church of St. Cyprian and Justina was built in 1742 in the eastern part of Vis, in the region known as Kut. Here, there was once a church built at the beginning of the 15th century, whose remains are still visible in the rear wing of today&#x27;s church, with an immured opening of a Gothic window. A flat façade of the church shows late baroque decorations weaving with a number of gothic motifs - rounded and quatrefoil windows intertwine with baroque vaults on a triangular pediment. Seven small windows together with a niche inside which was the statue of the martyr St. Cyprian constructors, adom the upper part of the façade which ends with borders that have been executed with laid and threaded vaults. In the lower part, closer to the portal, there are shallow pilasters above which are roses. The interior of the church hosts a spacious apse and two side chapels which give the church layout the form of a cross, but this is hardly noticeable thanks to the shallowness of the chapels. The church ceiling is wooden and relief coffered with decorations in the form of rhombuses with stylized flowers whilst in its centre a canvas has been inserted representing the Creator. Close to the church there is also a bell tower built at the same time. It is decorated in the same way as the church façade with horizontal belts, quatrefoil openings, relief roses, angel heads, elliptic windows and final vases. It also has loopholes oriented towards the port, thus making it is easy to see that the constructors had tried to use its dominant position to defense purpose too.
The Church of St. George was built in the 9th century on a small peninsula situated at the entrance to the deep Vis bay. The Vis bay was named after it in the Middle Ages becoming the Port of St. George, there was also an islet at the entrance &quot;Škoj sv. Jurja&quot; (the cliff of St. George) as well as &quot;Jurjevo brdo&quot; (George&#x27;s hill) to the east, and Saint George is the patron of the town of Vis. The church has been modified over time, so today the appearance of its façade on which the door have been enlarged and two smaller windows have been added, shows more stylistic characteristics of the 16th century than its original ones. Inside the church walls are divided with pilaster strips whilst two Byzantine amphorae have been built into the vault of the church. The Church&#x27;s apse is semicircular with an altar that replaced the old one in the 17th century. Hermits lived here throughout the 15th century whose graves were found around the church.

The Church and monastery of St. Jerome was built on the small peninsula of Prirovo at the beginning of the 16th century. The church façade was made of marble taken from the adjacent ruins of ancient Issa, primarily from the Roman theatre over which the Franciscan monastery was built. The Church&#x27;s door is simply profiled, adorned with swallow carved roses with a lunette above them. A little above the centre of the church façade there is a gothic renaissance window in the form of ring, surrounded by ovules. At the northern side doors there is unfinished relief of the stigmatisation.

The Gariboldi Palace was built in 1552. At the beginning of the 16th century, Frane Gariboldi moved from Milan to Hvar, becoming an inhabitant, and building a house and shop in a very crowded part of the town and a graveyard in the Franciscan church. He owned land on Vis and so built a palace there soon after on which above the portal of the outer, high façade wall he placed an inscription where he emphasized that he was a citizen of Hvar and outline his Milanese origins. LAVS DEO FRANCISCVS GARIBOLDVS MEDIOLANENSIS NVNC CIVIS LESINAE PRO SE IPSO AC FILIIS ET HEREDIBVS SIV HOC OPVS CONSTRVXIT MDLII. A paved courtyard extends behind the fenced wall that was later partitioned with divisions and shortened. There is also a well spring. The house façade was dismembered with profiled windows and bordered with the stone wreath of the roof adorned with stone acroterions in the form of a sphere. On the ground floor there is a cellar whilst stoned steps lead from the ground floor to the first floor and to the central door, above which is a Latin inscription. GLORIA LAVS ET HONOR TIBI SIT CHRISTE REDMEPTOR. Above the door a relief coat of arms stands out in which there is a fortress and four stars whilst on both sides there are the initials of Fran&#x27;s name F.G.

The Gazarović Palace was built by the well-known Croatian writer, dramatist and poet Marin Gazarović, the author of &quot;Murat Gusar&quot;, &quot;Ljubica&quot; and other works-of-art. He built this palace as a place for resting and to monitor his land ownership, as did many other Dalmatian nobles on their coastal lands. The summer residence with courtyard, completed prior to the last decade of the 16th century, is surrounded by a high wall and on the Renaissance portal the following verses by Gazarović have been inscribed in Croatian. PRIN NER CHIES CA PROCIN OSTAVI HIMBE VAN CA OBECHIASC VCIN AC HOCH BIT VIROVAN VIROM XIVE OV VICH DRAGYE VIRAN SLVGA YER CA TVRDI COVICH TVRDI ZA ZLA DRVGA. Gazarović&#x27;s palace was built in the late Renaissance style. On the ground floor there is a cellar illuminated by means of small rectangular windows, whilst on the outside stairs once leaned to the façade and up to the front door of the first floor. The writer&#x27;s apartment of the writer was found there; the interior was completely changed by subsequent construction, whilst parts of the stone Renaissance basin which were found in many Dalmatian houses in the period from the 15th to the 18th century can still be seen in its original form. At the centre of the façade was Gazarović&#x27;s coat of arms surrounded by mermaids whilst at the top there was a dragon with outstreched wings, which was carved by the writer himself.

The Renaissance and baroque one-story house of the Prdvarić family was built in the later 16th century and is situated at the part of Vis known as Kut, close to the sea. On the ground floor there was once a tavern, whilst on the first floor there is a central hall situated between side rooms which are entered through a door with profiled stone frames. In the hall covered by a wooden ceiling that relies on stone consoles, there is a profiled well&#x27;s crown and a large walled in basin with two stone shelves on side consoles decorated with lilies, while at the bottom there is a grotesque mask in relief. Grotesque masks are typical decorations of Dalmatian wall basin from the 16th to the 18th century.

The Perasti tower, &quot;kaštil&quot;, was built of Vicko of Perast in Bay of Kotor, in 1617. He requested permission to construct from the general commissioner which he received on December 16, 1616. There is not much information about Vicko of Perast, the builder of the tower. The earliest document in which he is mentioned dates back to 1587 in which his family was also mentioned. He was always given the title Sir (&quot;ser&quot;, &quot;dominus&quot;). Vicko of Perast lived in the Vis settlement of Luka, in his own house close to the tower, and died in 1622. He built the tower on his own land as defence from himself and other Vis inhabitants against possible Ottoman attacks on the town. The castle walls are divided by horizontal garlands whilst there are openings for cannons and loopholes along the walls. There are square sentry boxes standing on consoles at the corners of the tower whilst acroterions adorn their roof part. The tower was entered from a door situated on the first floor, which connected to Perasti&#x27;s house by means of a wooden bridge. As this was the only in the door the tower, all equipment was brought inside along the wooden bridge and through it. The tower was armed with small bronze cannons that are mentioned in documents in the 17th in the 18th century. It was forbidden to build walls, houses and other facilities around the tower that would impede the defensive action of the cannons situated within it.

Our Lady&#x27;s Battalion (&quot;Gospina batarija&quot;) is the main fortress built by the Austrians during their reign over the island. It was built in the 1830s, in the very heart of Vis Bay, in a place known as Levaman. Following the Italian occupation of Vis, this fortress was renamed &quot;Batteria della Madonna&quot;. The fortress surrounded by a 2 m deep trench whilst defence walls are inclined and made of finely worked stone. Entrance the fortress is from the eastern wing, constructed as an arch, with well worked stone protruding from a wall. The fortress itself was entered by means of a wooden drawbridge into a spacious rectangular courtyard on the bottom of which was a well to supply water to the fortress. In the southern part of the courtyard is an elevated embankment surrounded by a high inclined wall on which there were once cannons. Below the embankment is a lovely parabolic arched vault with storage spaces and a dungeon. The main building is to be found in the southern part with a single storey and floor were command of the island and a barracks for the accommodation of officers and soldiers were situated. During the remarkable Battle of Vis, which took place from July 18 to July 20, 1866, it played an important role, damaging the Italian ship, , captained by Simone Antonio Saint-Bon.

Fort George was built by the British when Austrian Imperial authority in region was ceded to the French as a part of a humiliating peace settlement dictated by Napoleon. Fearing Napoleon would turn the Adriatic into a &quot;French lake&quot;, with free rein to launch warships from the Venetian Arsenal and expand his empire further into Europe, the Royal Navy was sent to the Adriatic with a regiment of foot and detachment of artillery to prevent Napoleon&#x27;s ambitions coming to fruition. The British had used the island of Vis for its fresh water and safe anchorage for a number of years prior the committing defences to the island. In 1811 the French successfully raided the bay of Vis inflicting damage to the town and destroying numerous merchant vessels. It was hence decided that the bay of Vis needed protection from further such attacks. Initial defences were built on Host Island in the middle of the harbour, consisting of two 18 pound guns in a stone fortification. In 1812 Fort George was begun after the British Governor, Colonel Robertson, decided that the harbour needed greater protection. Fort George was to be primarily a light cannon and musketry defence and was therefore built to cooperate with three further Martello towers; towers Bentick and Robertson to the rear of the fort and Wellington across the bay. Like the defences on Host Island, these Martello towers would carry large cannon able of deterring enemy ships from approaching the bay. The defense towers and Fort George were built under the supervision of Captain Henryson using labourers recruited directly from the island and remained strictly under the jurisdiction of the army whilst the battery on Host Island remained under the control of the Royal Navy. The defences were completed by late 1813 and two years later were handed to the Austrians, who had begun reclaiming control of their Adriatic territories following decline and eventual fall of Napoleonic forces in the region.

There is no information on when and where in Issa the bronze bust of the goddess Artemis was found. It was held in a house on the island of Vis, and was probably part of the collection of the Dojmi family of Vis. In the 1950s it was brought to the Archaeological Museum in Split, where many years of conservation works and scholarly analysis commenced. It belonged to a bronze sculpture between 1.5 and 1.6 m in height. The bust depicts a young woman with an idealized appearance. Her face, with no lines, exudes the harmonious tranquility of her internal disposition. The eyes are large and lined with a light leaf (lead), which creates a powerful colourist contrast in relation to the greenish patina of the bronze. The young woman&#x27;s eye sockets are nicely sculpted, and the mouth is small. The hair is wavy and quite natural, so that even individual locks are intertwined. It is parted down the middle, and combed into a bun at the back of her head, leaving her ears free. There is a diadem just above the forehead, which has on it a decoration resembling a tendril. The neck is broken off of the body in a jagged line. The facial expression and the shape of the head indicate sculptural elements based on the tradition of Praxiteles. It is an original Greek cult statue made in either the late fourth or early third century BC. There is a considerable archaeological evidence testifying to the cult of Artemis in Issa.

==Education==
* Vis Primary school 
* Until the 1960s secondary schools existed in the villages of Podselje, Podstražje and Marine Zemlje but these were eventually closed because of the lack of students due to drastic emigration that affected the island as a whole. In 1975 a secondary school named after Antun Matijašević - Karamaneo was built. It remains the sole centre of secondary education on the island.

==Sports==
* Cricket Club, named after Sir William Hoste, Bt.

<text>Gatso is the brand that Gatsometer BV (now known as Sensys Gatso Group when Sensys acquired Gatso in 2015) use on their speed cameras and red light cameras. The most commonly encountered Gatso speed cameras emit radar beams to measure the speed of a passing vehicle. If it is travelling above the preset trigger speed, one or two photographs are taken (depending on the device&#x27;s setting, which generally depends on the requirements of the local jurisdiction). These use a powerful flash, to show the rear of the vehicle, its registration plate, and calibration lines on the road (in many jurisdictions). Newer installations used digital cameras which have limited exposure latitude compared to film, these installations use an auxiliary flash placed close to the position where a speeding vehicle would exit the radar beam and the first photograph would be taken.

==Operation==
Gatso installations in the UK and in Queensland, Australia are characterised by a measurement strip on the road surface, which is a series of white lines painted on the road, which are used with two photographs taken by the camera. These white lines are sometimes known as &#x27;secondary check marks&#x27;. The camera is set to take two photographs, with a constant time interval between them, usually 0.5 seconds for faster roads and 0.7 seconds for slower roads. The difference in the vehicle&#x27;s position in the two photographs can be used to calculate its speed. 

In the UK, the evidence is admissible in court using the speed measured by the radar. The speed calculated from the distance travelled between the photographs using the secondary check mark white lines is used by police forces to verify the radar reading, and can be used as a defence in the event of an unreliable reading by the radar.

It can be a common misconception by drivers that the police do not use the distance travelled between the secondary check marks before issuing a notice in the post. The police can make mistakes, but the combination of radar reading and secondary check marks is a robust case for prosecution.

The speed indicated by the radar unit can be prone to error due to multiple reflections etc. With a minority of vehicle types such as lorries towing a curtain sided trailer. Further, it does not distinguish between multiple vehicles in shot, however secondary check marks will identify which vehicles are speeding, providing the police with corroborative evidence.

==UK deployment==

The first red light cameras were introduced in an initiative in the City of Nottingham in 1988 following a triple fatal road traffic accident at a traffic light controlled road junction.

The Department of Transport took an interest, and sponsored a trial involving the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police. The operational base was at the West London Traffic Unit. Roger Reynolds, a Police Sergeant (later to become President of the Royal Photographic Society) undertook operational trials of the equipment and, by adjusting the camera controls, managed to use colour film for the first time replacing black and white film. Reynolds made the first successful use of the Gatso camera on the A316 road at Twickenham Bridge in 1992.

The first controlled junction was at the Hanger Lane Gyratory, on the A406 North Circular Road southbound at its junction with the A40 Western Avenue. This junction was then followed by the A501 Marylebone Road at its junction with Gloucester Place. A further installation was commissioned on the eastbound A40 at its junction with Long Lane (Hillingdon). After the camera units were deployed there was a significant reduction in accident rates in their vicinity.

The Police Camera team developed paper handling systems using (then) current process and later laid down systems to incorporate conditional offer fixed penalty systems. The processes developed by the team formed the basis of similar systems, used and modified by other police forces. Also a member of the Team travelled to Hong Kong and assisted in the introduction of cameras there.

Speed cameras were also evaluated by the Metropolitan police team for their speed limit enforcement capabilities before the system was rolled out. The linear markings suggested by the team are now an integral part of the camera site marking.

The team that introduced the system and the engineers of the Department of Transport, as road safety specialists, were keen to use the equipment to change driver behaviour and thus improve road safety. However strategic control of cameras later moved to the safety camera partnerships. prosecution thresholds. Many UK police forces apply the enforcement threshold guidelines recommended by the National Police Chiefs&#x27; Council.

Gatso cameras in the UK previously had deployment requirements, in common with all fixed speed camera types operated in the UK by safety camera partnerships (SCPs) under the National Safety Camera Programme (NSCP). They had to be marked, made visible, located in places with a history of serious accidents, and where there was evidence of a speeding problem, or where there was a local community concern.

Since April 2007 however, such requirements have been removed. It is still recommended that cameras be made visible and roads with fixed ones, clearly signed, but they can now be placed at any location, regardless of its crash history. Cameras operated solely by the Police, outside the NSCP schemes, do not need to comply with visibility requirements.

The funding arrangements for SCPs also changed in April 2007. SCPs no longer keep the funds from speeding fines. After this, an annual &#x27;road safety grant&#x27; was given to local authorities, who can choose whether or not to invest it in these partnerships. The Specific Road Safety Grant was cancelled in 2010 by the Department for Transport following the 2010 UK Government&#x27;s Comprehensive Spending Review. As of 2020 there is no annual funding for road safety from the UK Government to Local or Combined Authorities.

Concerns have been raised that the powerful flash used when the cameras trigger may dazzle drivers travelling in the opposite direction. The flash on the Truvelo Combi is fitted with a magenta gel to obviate this issue.

==Gatsometer BV==
The Gatso camera is manufactured by the Dutch company GATSOmeter BV. The company&#x27;s history started with a device invented by the champion rally driver Maurice Gatsonides. He used the device to record his speeds as he drove through various curves and other road configurations, so that he could review his line and speed so as to optimise his performance in future races. The company was later formed to market the devices as police speed enforcement tools and remains largely a family concern with two Gatsonides among the five directors.

The company&#x27;s products, particularly the &quot;Gatsometer 24&quot;, have achieved such a high level of market penetration in the UK and some European countries that the term &quot;Gatso&quot; became synonymous with &quot;speed camera&quot; across a significant proportion of Europe. Historically, the company has had less success marketing its products in the USA, where it operated initially through agents or by selling its cameras to other companies that would integrate them into larger systems for customers. The most notable installed base of Gatsometer products in the USA is that in and around Washington, D.C. However, Gatsometer BV now has an American subsidiary, in the form of GATSO-USA, which now markets the company&#x27;s products direct and competes with the other speed/red-light camera companies active in the North American market.

<text>Mark Andrew Vermeulen (born 2 March 1979) is a former Zimbabwean cricketer, who played Test matches and One Day Internationals. He is a right-handed opening batsman and occasional off spin bowler.

== Domestic career ==
He was a former captain of the Zimbabwe Under-19 team. Despite his troubles Vermeulen had an excellent 2004–05 season in which he averaged 43.60 in domestic cricket but the rise in his numbers coincided with economic decline and political turmoil and he did not immediately have the opportunity to see if that could translate on the cricket field.

He spent time at the Matabeleland Tuskers, Mid West Rhinos, Mountaineers and Southern Rocks and completed a full house of playing for all the teams in the country when he returned to the Mash Eagles in his home-town of Harare. The domestic season was stalled by a player strike but once it got underway, Vermeulen made good on his commitment. He was the second-highest run scorer in the Logan Cup with 580 runs in seven matches at an average of 64.44.

A complete turnaround was achieved when he was selected for the Zimbabwe A tour of Namibia in February 2009.

==International career==
He was an attacking and naturally athletic player, who was first drafted into the Zimbabwe squad for the second Test against Pakistan in November 2002 at the expense of Guy Whittall.

He made a few decent scores in one-day internationals and played three matches in the 2003 World Cup. He was struck on the head by a ball bowled by Irfan Pathan during Zimbabwe&#x27;s VB Series campaign in Australia in 2004. In 2009, Vermeulen made a brief comeback for ODIs against South Africa but then disappeared off the radar again while he made his way around Zimbabwe&#x27;s domestic circuit.

On the 2003–04 tour of Australia, Vermeulen fractured his skull during a One-Day International match against India. This was the second time this had happened to him inside a year, after the identical injury occurred in February 2003 while practising. Successful surgery has limited the impact that these injuries have had on Vermeulen&#x27;s cricketing career.

Although he had a side career in golf, Vermeulen decided to make the 2013–14 season his final go at trying to be an international cricketer. In July 2014, he was given hope that his international career would be resurrected when he was picked for the Zimbabwe A side to play Afghanistan. He scored a century in the first four-day match and could not be overlooked for the one-off Test against South Africa which followed. Brendan Taylor described him as calm, for a change.

A decade after last playing in whites for Zimbabwe, Vermeulen made a comeback in August 2014. In July 2009, the comeback was complete with Vermeulen earning a call up to the Zimbabwe squad for the One Day International Series against Bangladesh. In the first match of the series, played at Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo, Vermeulen scored 92 in Zimbabwe&#x27;s score of 207, before being dismissed by being run out.

== Disciplinary problems ==
He has had a number of disciplinary problems. He was sent home from Zimbabwe&#x27;s tour of England in 2003 after ignoring management instructions to travel with the rest of the squad. Then in 2006 he was banned from all cricket played under the auspices of the England and Wales Cricket Board after a violent altercation with spectators at a match between Ashton and his club, Werneth in the Central Lancashire League. The original ban imposed was ten years, but on appeal it was reduced to three years, two of which were suspended. The ban took effect from 1 April 2007.

In November 2006, Vermeulen was held by police after apparently fleeing the scene of a suspicious fire at the Zimbabwean Cricket Academy in Harare. A fire had also been set at the Zimbabwe Cricket headquarters. ZCU Managing Director Ozias Bvute confirmed that Vermeulen was being held &quot;for questioning&quot; in the incident. Vermeulen was formally charged with arson in the incident on 2 November. In January 2008, he was cleared on grounds of mental illness, and in February announced that he was hoping to make a comeback.

In May 2008, Vermeulen offered to help rebuild the academy he burnt by using a percentage of his earnings that he would get by playing for Zimbabwe again.

In October 2015, Vermeulen was banned from all cricket by Zimbabwe Cricket after posting racist comments on social media, where he compared black Zimbabweans to apes.

== Style ==
At his most comfortable against pace bowling, Vermeulen was a back-foot player by inclination, particularly strong on the cut, pull and hook shots, although he was also a sweet timer of the ball through the covers. He was an excellent slip fielder, and an occasional offbreak bowler.

<text>Eberhardt August Wilhelm von Zimmermann (August 17, 1743, Uelzen – July 4, 1815, Braunschweig) was a German geographer and zoologist.

He studied natural philosophy and mathematics in Leiden, Halle, Berlin, and Göttingen, and in 1766, was appointed professor of mathematics and natural sciences at the Collegium Carolinum in Braunschweig. One of his pupils was mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. From 1789 onward, he served as aulic councillor in Braunschweig.

During his career, he travelled widely throughout Europe — Livonia, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. On his journeys, he conducted research of economic conditions and natural resources. He wrote &quot;Specimen Zoologiae Geographicae Quadrupedum&quot; (1777), one of the first works on the geographical distribution of mammals (zoogeography).

In 1794, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

He was the author of works on a variety of subjects, such as mathematics, natural sciences, regional studies, and the history of discovery. From 1802 to 1813, he published the &quot;Taschenbuch der Reisen&quot; (&quot;Handbook of Travel&quot;).

== Published works ==

<text>Stowięcino () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Główczyce, within Słupsk County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately south-east of Główczyce, east of Słupsk, and west of the regional capital Gdańsk.

==History==
The noble family of &quot;von Stojentin&quot; originates from the village which was mentioned in 1341 as the property of &quot;Bertold and Matzen van Stoyentin&quot;, in 1379 as property of &quot;Mertin and Barteke von Stoguntin&quot; and in 1402 as property of the &quot;olde Bartke van Stoyentyn&quot;. A church was first mentioned in 1519, it became Lutheran throughout the Protestant Reformation.

The estate was still in the possession of the Stojentin family in 1618 but was mentioned as property of Jürgen Ludwig von Wobeser&#x27;s widow in 1732. The von Wobesers remained owners of the Stojentin estate until 1820, when it was handed over to Heinrich Jesco von Puttkamer. In 1853 it was bought by Ferdinand Scheunemann, whose family would own the manor until 1945.

In 1925, 16 inhabitants were Catholics, 6 Jewish. In 1933 the village had 500, in 1939 475 inhabitants.

Throughout the East Pomeranian Offensive the village was occupied by Soviet forces on 9 March 1945, it had not been evacuated before and many inhabitants and refugees from surrounding villages were killed. The last owner of the estate, Mrs. Scheunemann, was killed by Soviet soldiers on 27 March 1945.

After World War II the town again became part of Poland, under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference. Poles expelled from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union started to settle in the area. The remaining German populace was expelled in a transport on 27 November 1946 heading to Torgau.

==Notable residents==
* Andrzej Lepper (1954–2011), founder of the Polish political party &quot;Samoobrona&quot; (&quot;Self-defence&quot;).

<text>Air racing is a type of motorsport that involves airplanes or other types of aircraft that compete over a fixed course, with the winner either returning the shortest time, the one to complete it with the most points, or to come closest to a previously estimated time.

==History==
The first &#x27;heavier-than-air&#x27; air race was held on 23 May 1909 - the Prix de Lagatinerie, at the Port-Aviation airport south of Paris, France. Four pilots entered the race, two started, but nobody completed the full race distance; though this was not unexpected, as the rules specified that whoever travelled furthest would be the winner if no-one completed the race. Léon Delagrange, who covered slightly more than half of the ten laps was declared the winner.

Some other minor events were held before the &quot;Grande Semaine d&#x27;Aviation de la Champagne&quot; in 22–29 August 1909 at Reims, France. This was the first major international flying event, drawing the most important aircraft makers and pilots of the era, as well as celebrities and royalty. The premier event — the first Gordon Bennett Trophy competition — was won by Glenn Curtiss, who beat second-place finisher Louis Blériot by five seconds. Curtiss was named &#x27;Champion Air Racer of the World&#x27;.
The first air race in the United States was the 1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field, just south of Los Angeles, from 10 to 20 January 1910. The event was organised by pilots A. Roy Knabenshue and Charles Willard, who raised funding from railroad magnate Henry Huntington, and the Los Angeles Merchants and Manufacturers Association. William Randolph Hearst carried coverage of the event in his &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, and hired a hot air balloon with a promotional parse touting his newspaper. The event attracted 43 entrants, of which 16 appeared. It was there that aviation pioneer and military pilot Jimmy Doolittle, then thirteen, saw his first airplane.

In the years before the First World War, popular interest in aviation led to a large number of air races in Europe; including the 1911 Circuit of Europe race, the Daily Mail Circuit of Britain Air Race, and the Aerial Derby.

In 1913, the first Schneider Trophy seaplane race was held. When the competition was resumed after the war, it was significant in advancing aeroplane design, particularly in the fields of aerodynamics and engine design, and would show its results in the best fighters of World War II.

On 19 October 1919, the Army Transcontinental Air Race began along a route from Long Island, New York to San Francisco, California, and back, which would see widespread carnage; including seven fatalities (two en route to the race). Of the 48 aircraft that started, 33 would complete the double crossing of the continent.
In 1921, the United States instituted the National Air Meets, which became the National Air Races in 1924. In 1929, the Women&#x27;s Air Derby, nicknamed the &#x27;Powder Puff Derby&#x27;, became a part of the National Air Races circuit. The National Air Races lasted until 1949. The Cleveland Air Races was another important event. In 1947, an All-Woman Transcontinental Air Race, also dubbed the Powder Puff Derby was established, running until 1977.

In 1934, the MacRobertson Air Race from England to Australia took place, with the winning de Havilland Comet flown by C. W. A. Scott and Tom Campbell Black.

In 1964, Bill Stead, a Nevada rancher, pilot, and unlimited hydroplane racing champion, organised the first Reno Air Races at a small dirt strip called the Sky Ranch, located between Sparks, Nevada, and Pyramid Lake. The National Championship Air Races were soon moved to the Reno Stead Airport, and have been held there every September since 1966. The five-day event attracts around 200,000 people, and includes racing around courses marked out by pylons for six classes of aircraft: Unlimited, Formula One, Sport Biplane, AT-6, Sport, and Jet. It also features civil airshow acts, military flight demonstrations, and a large static aircraft display. Other promoters have run pylon racing events across the US and Canada, including races in Las Vegas, NV in 1965, Lancaster, CA in 1965 and 1966, Mojave, California in 1970-71, and 1973–79; at Cape May, NJ in 1971, San Diego, CA in 1971, Miami, FL in 1973 and 1979, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan in 1984; Hamilton Field, California, in 1988; at Dallas, TX in 1990, in Denver, CO in 1990 and 1992, in Kansas City in 1993, in Phoenix, Arizona in 1994 and 1995; and in Tunica, Mississippi in 2005. Numerous other venues across the United States, Canada, and Mexico have also hosted events featuring the smaller Formula One and Biplane classes.

In 1970, American Formula One racing was exported to Europe (Great Britain, and then to France), where almost as many races have been held as in the U.S.A. Also in 1970, the California 1000 Air Race started at the Mojave Airport with a 66 lap unlimited air race that featured a Douglas DC-7, with one aircraft completing the circuit.

In 2003, Red Bull created a series called the Red Bull Air Race World Championship, in which competitors flew individually between pairs of pylons, while performing prescribed manoeuvres. Usually held over water near large cities, the sport has attracted large crowds and renewed media interest in air racing. The inaugural season had stops in Austria and Hungary. In 2019, Red Bull decided not to continue the Red Bull Air Race World Championship.

Aero GP has multiple aircraft racing together pik around pylons, and is based in Europe where it has held an air race each year since 2005.

In June of 2005 against all odds and extreme pressure from the Reno Air Race Association not to start another race, entrepreneur Jeff Landers, a Memphis native, organized the Tunica Air Races in Tunica, Mississippi with Unlimited, T-6, and Sport classes represented. After the successful and safe race in 2005 RARA fought any and all efforts for the growth of this motorsport and any effort for a 2006 race there and one in Tucson Arizona. 

Powered paragliding or paramotor races have been organised by the Parabatix Sky Racers made up of the world&#x27;s top paramotor pilots. The first occurring on 4 September 2010 in an airfield in Montauban, Southern France. These are foot-launched ram-air wings powered by small two-stroke engines, and allow for much smaller race venues such as city parks or beaches, where the audience can see the pilots up close as they carry out spectacular manoeuvres swooping close to the ground-pylons during the race.

In November 2021, the first remotely-piloted eVTOL drag race between two Airspeeder craft took place. In 2022, The remotely-piloted racing series (Airspeeder EXA Series) began in 2022 with Zephatali Walsh named as the inaugural season champion. The aircraft, built by Alauda Aeronautics, use electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) technology and are designed to be crewed by human pilots.

==Classes==
Restricting aircraft to a specific type or design creates a competition that focuses on pilot skill. Air racing events such as the Reno air races, incorporate multiple classes or aircraft. These may be defined by the race organiser, or by a sanctioned group. Some air races are limited to a single class. Classes used at the Reno races are as follows:

<text>Te Aroha is a rural town in the Waikato region of New Zealand with a population of 3,906 people in the 2013 census, an increase of 138 people since 2006. It is northeast of Hamilton and south of Thames. It sits at the foot of Mount Te Aroha, the highest point in the Kaimai Range.

== Etymology ==
The name Te Aroha comes from the eponymous Mount Te Aroha. The name of the mountain is shortened from (love flowing inland). This name is accepted as describing a longing for a homeland, with various stories in Māori oral tradition about the naming of the mountain. Originally, the northern area of the town was known as &quot;Morgantown&quot; after the Māori chief Morgan Hou, whilst the southern part was known as &quot;Lipseytown&quot; after Hou&#x27;s daughter Ema Lipsey.

==History==
In 1879 the Te Aroha Block was surveyed, the block was subdivided into sections of between . George Lipsey was the first European to settle in Te Aroha. Lipsey came from Thames and married the daughter of Morgan Hou, Ema. Morgan was a Maori chief who owned the land that became Te Aroha. The population grew quickly during the 1880s as a result of a gold rush. A spa was founded in 1883 but popularity had declined by the 1930s. In the 1880s farmers from Lincolnshire came to settle the surrounding area which helped with the growth of Te Aroha and the wider Piako County area. A report to Parliament by James McKerrow in 1881 described the town as being in the most favourable spot referencing transport, roads, and farm land surrounding the town.

Te Aroha Borough Council took over from the 1880 Town Board on 2 May 1898. Herriesville became part of Te Aroha Borough Council. The 1938 Council Chambers is now a Category 2 listed building. Matamata-Piako District Council took over under the 1989 local government reforms.

The construction of a railway line led to Te Aroha becoming a popular tourist destination by the late 1890s. People came to Te Aroha for both leisure and health reasons. Te Aroha was compared to famous European spas and hotels popped up to service travellers. Starting in the 20th century the popularity of the baths at Te Aroha declined. Starting in the 1930s the town and baths experienced financial losses which led to the closure of the baths. In 1961 the Cadman Baths closed and the outdoor swimming pool was filled in.

The area around Te Aroha was originally swampland, but it was drained and became productive agricultural land, this led to Te Aroha becoming a service town for the wider rural area. Te Aroha became a town district in 1884, at the time it had a school, post office, police station, and a multiple churches.

On 17 February 1985 Te Aroha experienced a severe flash flood that washed boulders, mud, and trees through the town. Most shops and more than 50 homes were damaged, resulting in the death of three people.
===Gold mining===
Gold was discovered near Te Aroha on 11 September 1880. On 20 November 1880, the Te Aroha Goldmining District was established under the Goldmining Districts Act 1873. This sparked a gold rush and the town with over 500 miners 5 days after the proclamation. Compared to other gold rushes—such as the one at Ohinemuri 5 years prior—the rush at Te Aroha was described as tame and peaceful. Despite the hype around the discovery of gold it was soon discovered that the was a fault crush and nothing more was found. Miners started moving away as little gold was discovered. Gold was soon discovered in 1883 at Waiorongomai and the remaining miners headed there, although some left their families in Te Aroha.
=== Bridges ===

Coulter Bridge, over the Waihou River, on Kenrick St (SH26) was rebuilt in 1910 and the present bridge was built alongside it in 1928. The 1885 railway bridge had an and 9 of spans, with a swing span at its east end. It was rebuilt in 1912, replacing an 1895 swing bridge. It is now a footbridge, but will not be replaced.

=== Railway stations ===

The Thames Branch reached Te Aroha in 1885 and the station opened on 1 March 1886, when it had a partly built 4th class station (completed in June 1886 by W Cameron for about £2,750, with some buildings probably also moved from Eureka to Te Aroha), platform, cart approach, x goods shed (extended in 1942), loading bank, engine shed, stationmaster&#x27;s house, urinals and a passing loop for 48 wagons. Te Aroha remained a terminus until the line to Paeroa opened on 20 December 1895. Cattle yards were added later in 1886, a coffee stall in 1896 and more improvements in 1897. The station was described in 1902 as: &quot;of wood, and include a ladies&#x27; waiting room, a public waiting room, a vestibule, stationmaster&#x27;s office, ticket office, and parcels office. There is a long asphalted platform.&quot;

The area west of the Waihou was named Herriesville from 1914, when a private railway siding was opened on 24 January 1914 to serve the A&amp;P ground. William Herries had been a local landowner. Seven railway cottages were built in 1924. Both stations closed to passengers on 11 September 1967 and to freight on 11 July 1986, though Herriesville was only open for racecourse traffic.

==Demographics==
In 1886 Te Aroha riding (which includes rural land far from the town) had a population of 1,203, by 1891 this had decreased to 1016, with 615 in the town district and the rest in the outlying areas.

== Geography ==

===Mount Te Aroha===
The eponymous Mount Te Aroha is the highest peak of the Kaimais at at and dominates the landscape. A road leads up to the summit. The road began construction 1963 so a television repeater station could be installed at the top of the summit. The station serves the Waikato and Bay of Plenty areas.
===Hot springs===
Thermal and mineral springs are both found close to the centre of the town. The springs have been used by the Māori for many years before becoming popular in the 1870s with European settlers. The New Zealand Herald writes that the site was gifted to New Zealand by chief Mokena Hou in the 1880s. The hot spring water emerges from the source at a range of 75 °C /167 °F to 85 °C / 185 °F, and is cooled before reaching the soaking pools. Te Aroha has a hot soda-water geyser, which is the only one of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.
===Climate===

== Economy ==
Te Aroha is at the centre of a dairy farming community and much of its economic activity is in serving that community. Tourism is increasing in Te Aroha. The mineral baths are a very popular spot for tourists and locals alike.
Historically mining played a role in the area, some mines had have had a long impact, such as toxic residues leaking from the abandoned Tui mine tailings dam.

== Notable places ==
The Mokena Hou Geyser, the only natural soda water geyser in the world is located on the lower slopes of Mount Te Aroha. The geyser is named after Morgan (Mokena) Hou. It is used to make the drink Lemon &amp; Te Aroha, which has been produced on and off since 1888. The geyser complex, the most intact Edwardian spa in New Zealand, is located in the Te Aroha Domain.
The category 1 Grand Tavern was constructed as a hotel between 1880 and 1881 during the local gold rush. The hotel was one of several in Te Aroha that serviced travellers coming for the hot springs. The Grand Tavern is a grand Victorian two-storeyed building and a rare example of an extant Victorian hotel in New Zealand.
===Te Aroha Domain===

The Te Aroha Domain is registered as a historic area. It housed the original baths used to attract tourists the town. Today the domain still retains many of the original Edwardian buildings and serves as an attraction for tourists.

<doc id="810476" wikidata="Q7278840" url="?curid=810476" title="Racal">
<text>Racal Electronics plc was a British electronics company that was founded in 1950. Listed on the London Stock Exchange and once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, Racal was a diversified company, offering products including voice recorders and data recorders, point of sale terminals, laboratory instruments and military electronics, including radio and radar. At its height it was the third largest British electronics firm; it operated worldwide and employed over 30,000 people at its height. It was the parent company of Vodafone, before the mobile telephony provider was sold in 1991.

Racal was bought by Thomson-CSF (now called Thales Group) in 2000. The purchase was expected to roughly double the size of the French defence giant&#x27;s operations in the UK, a country that already represented one of its biggest export markets in Europe.

In 2001, Racal Instruments Inc. became an independent company after a leveraged buyout from Thales. In 2004, it was acquired by EADS North America Defense and Test Services Inc., which was then acquired by Astronics Corporation in 2014. The Racal brand now resides with Astronics Test Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Astronics Corporation.

==Foundation==
Racal was created in 1950 as Racal Ltd, the name being derived from the names of the partners, Raymond Brown and George Calder Cunningham.

Ernest Harrison joined the company as employee number 13 as an accountant, but later held the positions of chief buyer, personnel director and contract negotiator.

The first factory was located in Isleworth, Middlesex. On outgrowing this site it moved to Bracknell, Berkshire in 1954, enticed by a 99-year lease at four shillings and sixpence per square foot – and no rent reviews.

Although Racal had won a Royal Navy contract to build and supply a variant of the American Collins Model 51-J Radio Receiver, they were not granted a licence to build these sets by Collins Inc. This meant that Racal had to design and build a radio receiver from scratch. After almost bankrupting the company due to a £40,000 overspend, the result was the &#x27;RA17&#x27; – in production from 1955 to at least 1973 – designed in co-operation with Trevor Wadley and using his &quot;Wadley Loop&quot; circuit.

==Racal under Harrison==
Harrison joined the company board in 1958, and as deputy managing director from 1961 helped Racal to obtain a Stock Market listing. Harrison became chairman in 1966, after co-founder Ray Brown was lured away by the Ministry of Defence. During his tenure, several major deals were achieved:
* Negotiation of a British Army battlefield radio contract (initially Larkspur, later part of Clansman) which secured the future of Racal
* The merger between Racal and British Communications Corporation, that bolstered Racal&#x27;s radio business
* Buying Decca Radar in 1980 against competition from GEC, the rival British company led by Lord Weinstock
* Buying the British Rail Telecommunications network, to form the basis of Racal Telecom
* Creating and spinning-out the Vodafone mobile phone network
* Stopping a proposed takeover by Williams Holdings by demerging Chubb
* Investing in National Lottery company Camelot Group
* Selling Racal Telecom to Global Crossing
* Selling Racal&#x27;s remaining defence and industrial electronics divisions to Thomson-CSF of France for £1.3 billion

Under Harrison, £1,000 invested in Racal in 1961 would have been worth £14.5million when he retired in 2000. Harrison received an estimated £25 million from the sale of Racal in 2000, and is estimated to have died with an accumulated total wealth of £40 million.

===Decca Radar===
In 1979, Racal bought Decca Radar forming Racal-Decca. Racal-Datacom conducted business in the United States.

===Vodafone===

In 1980, Harrison agreed a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC&#x27;s tactical battlefield radio technology. Briefing the head of Racal&#x27;s military radio division, Gerry Whent, to drive the company into commercial mobile radio, Whent visited GE&#x27;s factory in Virginia, USA in 1980.

In 1982, Racal&#x27;s newly formed subsidiary Racal Strategic Radio Ltd, under Whent, won one of the first two UK cellular telephone network licences; the other going to British Telecom. The network, known as Racal Vodafone, was 80% owned by Racal, with Millicom having 15% and the Hambros Technology Trust 5%. Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985. Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited in 1985. On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics bought out the minority shareholders of Vodafone for £110 million.

In 1988, 20% of Racal Telecom was floated on the London Stock Exchange. This would lead to the situation where Racal Electronics was valued at less than its shareholding in Racal Telecom. Harrison demerged Racal Telecom in October 1991, forcing a positive valuation on the rest of Racal (colloquially known in the City of London as &quot;the rump&quot;). Vodafone would later become the largest mobile network in the world and the highest valued company on the FTSE 100. Immediately following the demerger, Williams Holdings launched a takeover bid for Racal. The bid, valued at £740m, failed.

===Racal Vadic===
The company marketed modems under the name Racal-Vadic, and was among the first to offer 2400 baud modems in the early 1980s. Another name it used was Racal-Milgo.

===Chubb Security===
In 1984, Racal bought Chubb, a security company that manufactured safes and locks. In 1992, Chubb was demerged from Racal and was subsequently taken over by Willams Holdings in 1997.

===Racal Telecoms===
Racal re-established a telecoms division with a major government contract in 1988 and the acquisition of British Rail Telecommunications in 1995. This division of the former nationalised industry owned telecoms infrastructure laid across the rail network.

===Racal Instrumentation===
Consisted of Racal Recorders (Hythe, Southampton) and Racal Instruments (Burnham, near Slough). Racal acquired Thermionic Products in 1967, creating Racal Thermionics, renamed Racal Recorders in 1978. Racal Recorders produced a wide range of magnetic tape recorders for multichannel voice recording and instrumentation recording applications.

===Racal Redac===
Provided Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and facilities, primarily for design of printed circuit boards; based at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.

===National Lottery===
In 1994, Camelot Group – in which Racal had a 22.5% share – won the franchise to operate the UK National Lottery. After one of the founder shareholders, GTECH, was bought out by Camelot this stake increased to 26.67%.

===Break-up===
In 1995, Racal expanded its defence businesses with the acquisition of the Thorn Sensors Group from Thorn EMI. In 1998, all Racal&#x27;s defence businesses were reorganised under Racal Defence Electronics Ltd into Racal Radar Defence Systems, Racal Radio and Racal Thorn.

In October 1999, Racal decided to sell its telecoms business to the American communications group, Global Crossing, for £1bn.

In January 2000, Thomson-CSF announced a bid for the company: Racal became Thomson-CSF Racal plc, and later part of Thales plc with the renaming of the larger Thomson-CSF to Thales Group.

In December 2008, Racal Acoustics Ltd was acquired by Esterline Technologies, and has become part of their Communications Systems business.

<text>Tadeusz Borowski (; 12 November 1922 – 3 July 1951) was a Polish writer and journalist. His wartime poetry and stories dealing with his experiences as a prisoner at Auschwitz are recognized as classics of Polish literature.

== Early life ==
Borowski was born in 1922 into the Polish community in Zhytomyr, Ukrainian SSR (today Ukraine). In 1926, his father, whose bookstore had been nationalized by the communists, was sent to a camp in the Gulag system in Russian Karelia because he had been a member of a Polish military organization during World War I. In 1930, Borowski&#x27;s mother was deported to a settlement on the shores of the Yenisey, in Siberia, during Collectivization. During this time Tadeusz lived with his aunt.

Borowski and his family were targeted (as Poles) by the Soviet Union during Stalin&#x27;s Great Terror. In 1932, the Borowskis were expatriated to Poland by the Polish Red Cross in an exchange for Communist prisoners. Impoverished, the family settled in Warsaw.

== Experiences under Nazi occupation ==
Under Nazi occupation, Poles were forbidden to attend university or even secondary school. In 1940 Borowski finished his secondary schooling in Nazi-occupied Poland in an underground &quot;lyceum&quot;. He graduated from high school in 1940 amid the roundups of Jewish residents. He began his underground studies in Polish literature at Warsaw University. His classes met in secret at private homes. While attending university he met Maria Rundo, who would become the love of his life.

He also became involved with the leftist publication &quot;Droga&quot;. &quot;Wherever the Earth&quot; (1942), his anonymously self-published collection of poems, was distributed illegally. The poems have been described by modern scholars as &quot;remarkable for their dark view of the earth as an enormous labor camp&quot;.

While a member of the educational underground in Warsaw, Borowski was engaged and living with Rundo. After Maria did not return home one night in February 1943, Borowski began to suspect that she had been arrested. Rather than staying away from any of their usual meeting places, though, he walked straight into the trap that was set by the Gestapo agents in the apartment of his and Maria&#x27;s close friend. Borowski was 21 years old when he was imprisoned in Pawiak prison for two months before he was shipped to Auschwitz that April.

Forced into slave labor in extremely harsh conditions, Borowski later reflected on this experience in his writing. In particular, working on a railway ramp in Auschwitz-Birkenau, he witnessed arriving Jews being told to leave their personal property behind, and then being transferred directly from the trains to the gas chambers. While a prisoner at Auschwitz, Borowski caught pneumonia; afterwards, he was put to work in a Nazi medical experiment &quot;hospital.&quot; He was able to maintain written and personal contact with his fiancée, who was also imprisoned in Auschwitz.

In late 1944 Borowski was transported from Auschwitz to the Dautmergen subcamp of Natzweiler-Struthof, and finally to Dachau. Dachau-Allach, where Borowski was imprisoned, was liberated by the Americans on 1 May 1945; after that Borowski found himself in a camp for displaced persons near Munich.

==After the war==
He spent some time in Paris, and then returned to Poland on 31 May 1946. His fiancée, who had survived the camps and emigrated to Sweden, returned to Poland in late 1946, and they were married in December 1946.

Borowski turned to prose after the war, believing that what he had to say could no longer be expressed in verse. His series of short stories about life in Auschwitz was published as &quot;Pożegnanie z Marią&quot; (&quot;Farewell to Maria&quot;, English title &quot;This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;). The main stories are written in the first person from the perspective of an Auschwitz inmate; they describe the morally numbing effect of everyday terror, with prisoners, trying to survive, often being indifferent or mean towards each other; the privileges of non-Jewish inmates like Borowski; and the absence of any heroism. Early on after its publication in Poland, the work was accused of being nihilistic, amoral and decadent. His short story cycle &quot;World of Stone&quot; describes his time in displaced person camps in Germany.

Borowski&#x27;s short story &quot;Silence&quot; was written in the aftermath of the liberation of Dachau. The story is set in the newly liberated concentration camp and opens with imagery depicting a disgraced SS officer being dragged into an alley by a mob of prisoners who try to tear him apart with their bare hands. They return to the barracks and the scene is one of communal food preparation, prisoners noisily grinding grain, slicing meat, mixing pancake batter and peeling potatoes in the narrow paths that wind between their bunk beds. They are playing cards and drinking hot soup when an American officer arrives. While expressing sympathy for the prisoners seeking vengeance against their captors, he urges restraint, and promises punishment under law. Some prisoners begin to debate where to kill the American officer, but the crowd begins to applaud the officer&#x27;s promise of justice. When the American officer leaves the camp the prisoners return to the SS officer from the opening scene and trample him to death.

The Polish government considered the poem &quot;amoral&quot; but Borowski found work as a journalist. He joined the Soviet-controlled Polish Workers&#x27; Party in 1948 and wrote political tracts as well. At first he believed that Communism was the only political force truly capable of preventing any future Auschwitz from happening. In 1950 he received the National Literary Prize, Second Degree.

In the summer of 1949 he was sent to work in the Press Section of the Polish Military Mission in Berlin. He returned to Warsaw a year later and entered into an extramarital affair.

Soon after a close friend of his (the same friend who had earlier been imprisoned by the Gestapo, and in whose apartment both Borowski and his fiancée had been arrested) was imprisoned and tortured by the Communists. Borowski tried to intervene on his behalf and failed; he became completely disillusioned with the socialist regime.

==Death==
On July 3, 1951, at the age of 28, Borowski died by suicide by breathing in gas from a gas stove. His wife had given birth to their daughter, Małgorzata, a few days prior to his death.

&quot;On 6 July 1951, the openly anti-militarist Borowski was buried, of all places, in the military section of Powązki National Cemetery in Warsaw to the strains of &#x27;The Internationale&#x27;, and was posthumously awarded the highest honours. An obituary notice in &quot;Nowa Kultura&quot; was signed by 86 writers. Soon after, a special issue of this weekly newspaper appeared with contributions from the elite of Polish literature. Since then, countless texts, poems and articles by and about Borowski have been published, as well as many books in various languages and editions,&quot; writes Holocaust survivor Arnold Lustiger in &quot;Die Welt&quot;. The book &quot;This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; is now also published as part of &#x27;Penguin Classics&#x27;, further cementing Borowski&#x27;s place amongst literary greats.

==Legacy==
His books are recognized as classics of Polish post-war literature and had much influence in Central European society.

* Tadeusz Borowski is the subject of the &#x27;Beta&#x27; section in Czesław Miłosz&#x27;s book, &quot;The Captive Mind&quot;.

<doc id="810505" wikidata="Q164351" url="?curid=810505" title="Gerhard Richter">
<text>Gerhard Richter (; born 9 February 1932) is a German visual artist. Richter has produced abstract as well as photorealistic paintings, photographs and glass pieces. He is widely regarded as one of the most important contemporary German artists and several of his works have set record prices at auction, with him being the most expensive living painter at one time.

Richter has been called the &quot;greatest living painter&quot;, &quot;the world&#x27;s most important artist&quot; and the &quot;Picasso of the 21st century&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Childhood and education===
Richter was born in Hospital Dresden-Neustadt in Dresden, Saxony, and grew up in Reichenau (now Bogatynia, Poland), and in Waltersdorf (Zittauer Gebirge), in the Upper Lusatian countryside, where his father worked as a village teacher. Gerhard&#x27;s mother, Hildegard Schönfelder, gave birth to him at the age of 25. Hildegard&#x27;s father, Ernst Alfred Schönfelder, at one time was considered a gifted pianist. Ernst moved the family to Dresden after taking up the family enterprise of brewing and eventually went bankrupt. Once in Dresden, Hildegard trained as a bookseller, and in doing so realized a passion for literature and music. Gerhard&#x27;s father, Horst Richter, was a mathematics and physics student at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. The two were married in 1931.

After struggling to maintain a position in the new National Socialist education system, Horst found a position in Reichenau. Gerhard&#x27;s younger sister, Gisela, was born there in 1936. Horst and Hildegard were able to remain primarily apolitical due to Reichenau&#x27;s location in the countryside. Horst, being a teacher, was eventually forced to join the National Socialist Party. He never became an avid supporter of Nazism, and was not required to attend party rallies. When he was 10 years old, Gerhard was conscripted into the &quot;Deutsches Jungvolk&quot;; the Hitler Youth, for teenage boys, was dissolved at the end of the war, before Richter reached the age of enlistment. In 1943, Hildegard moved the family to Waltersdorf, and was later forced to sell her piano. Two brothers of Hildegard died as soldiers in the war and a sister, Gerhard&#x27;s aunt Marianne, who had schizophrenia, was starved to death in a pyschiatric clinic, a victim of the Nazi euthanasia program.

Richter left school after 10th grade and apprenticed as an advertising and stage-set painter, before studying at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In 1948, he finished vocational high school in Zittau and, between 1949 and 1951, successively worked as an apprentice with a sign painter and as a painter. In 1950, his application for study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts was rejected as &quot;too bourgeois&quot;. He finally began his studies at the Academy in 1951. His teachers there were Karl von Appen, , and Will Grohmann.

===Relationships===
Richter married Marianne Eufinger in 1957; she gave birth to his first daughter. He married his second wife, the sculptor Isa Genzken, in 1982. Richter had two sons and a daughter with his third wife, Sabine Moritz, after they were married in 1995.

===Early career===
In the early days of his career, he prepared a wall painting (&quot;Communion with Picasso&quot;, 1955) for the refectory of his Academy of Arts as part of his B.A. Another mural entitled &quot;Lebensfreude&quot; (Joy of life) followed at the German Hygiene Museum for his diploma. It was intended to produce an effect &quot;similar to that of wallpaper or tapestry&quot;.
From 1957 to 1961 Richter worked as a master trainee in the academy and took commissions for the then state of East Germany. During this time, he worked intensively on murals like &#x27; (Workers&#x27; struggle), on oil paintings (e.g. portraits of the East German actress Angelica Domröse and of Richter&#x27;s first wife Ema), on various self-portraits, and on a panorama of Dresden with the neutral name &#x27; (Townscape, 1956).

Together with his wife Marianne, Richter escaped from East to West Germany two months before the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Both his wall paintings in the Academy of Arts and the Hygiene Museum were then painted over for ideological reasons. Much later, after German reunification, two &quot;windows&quot; of the wall painting &quot;Joy of life&quot; (1956) would be uncovered in the stairway of the German Hygiene Museum, but these were later covered over when it was decided to restore the Museum to its original 1930 state. A large portion of the mural was finally uncovered and restored in 2024.

In West Germany, Richter began to study at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf under Karl Otto Götz, together with Sigmar Polke, Werner Hilsing, HA Schult, Kuno Gonschior, Franz Erhard Walther, Konrad Lueg, and Gotthard Graubner. With Polke and (pseudonym Lueg), he introduced the term &quot;&quot; (Capitalistic Realism) as an anti-style of art, appropriating the pictorial shorthand of advertising. This title also referred to the realist style of art known as Socialist Realism, then the official art doctrine of the Soviet Union, but it also commented upon the consumer-driven art doctrine of Western capitalism.

Richter taught at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design as a visiting professor; he returned to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1971, where he worked as a professor for over 15 years.

In 1983, Richter resettled from Düsseldorf to Cologne, where he still lives and works today. In 1996, he moved into a studio designed by architect Thiess Marwede.

==Art==

===Photo-paintings and the &quot;blur&quot;===
Richter created various painting pictures from black-and-white photographs during the 1960s and early 1970s, basing them on a variety of sources: newspapers and books, sometimes incorporating their captions, (as in &quot;Helga Matura&quot; (1966)); private snapshots; aerial views of towns and mountains, (&quot;Cityscape Madrid&quot; (1968) and Alps (1968)); seascapes (1969–70); and a large multipart work made for the German Pavilion in the 1972 Venice Biennale. For &quot;Forty-eight Portraits&quot; (1971–72), he chose mainly the faces of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Jean Sibelius, and of writers such as H. G. Wells and Franz Kafka.

From around 1964, Richter made a number of portraits of dealers, collectors, artists, and others connected with his immediate professional circle. Richter&#x27;s two portraits of &quot;Betty&quot;, his daughter, were made in 1977 and 1988 respectively; the three portraits titled &quot;IG&quot; were made in 1993 and depict the artist&#x27;s second wife, Isa Genzken. &quot;Lesende&quot; (1994) portrays Sabine Moritz, whom Richter married in 1995, shown absorbed in the pages of a magazine. Many of his realist paintings reflect on the history of Nazism, creating paintings of family members who had been members, as well as victims, of the Nazi party. From 1966, as well as those given to him by others, Richter began using photographs he had taken as the basis for portraits. In 1975, on the occasion of a show in Düsseldorf, Gilbert &amp; George commissioned Richter to make a portrait of them.

Richter began making prints in 1965. He was most active before 1974, only completing sporadic projects since that time. In the period 1965–1974, Richter made most of his prints (more than 100), of the same or similar subjects in his paintings. He has explored a variety of photographic printmaking processes – screenprint, photolithography, and collotype – in search of inexpensive mediums that would lend a &quot;non-art&quot; appearance to his work. He stopped working in print media in 1974, and began painting from photographs he took himself.

While elements of landscape painting appeared initially in Richter&#x27;s work early on in his career in 1963, the artist began his independent series of landscapes in 1968 after his first vacation, an excursion that landed him besotted with the terrain of Corsica. Landscapes have since emerged as an independent work group in his oeuvre. According to Dietmar Elger, Richter&#x27;s landscapes are understood within the context of traditional German Romantic Painting. They are compared to the work of Caspar David Friedrich (1774–1840). Friedrich is foundational to German landscape painting. Each artist spent formative years of their lives in Dresden. &quot;Große Teyde-Landschaft&quot; (1971) takes its imagery from similar holiday snapshots of the volcanic regions of Tenerife.

&quot;Atlas&quot; was first exhibited in 1972 at the Museum voor Hedendaagse Kunst in Utrecht under the title &quot;Atlas der Fotos und Skizzen&quot;. It included 315 parts. The work has continued to expand, and was exhibited later in full form at the Lenbachhaus in Munich in 1989, the Museum Ludwig in Cologne in 1990, and at Dia Art Foundation in New York in 1995. &quot;Atlas&quot; continues as an ongoing, encyclopedic work composed of approximately 4,000 photographs, reproductions or cut-out details of photographs and illustrations, grouped together on approximately 600 separate panels.

In 1972, Richter embarked on a ten-day trip to Greenland. His friend Hanne Darboven was meant to accompany him, but instead, he traveled alone. His intention was to experience and record the desolate arctic landscape. In 1976, four large paintings, each titled &quot;Seascape&quot;, emerged from the Greenland photographs.

In 1982 and 1983, Richter made a series of paintings of &quot;Candles&quot; and &quot;Skulls&quot; that relate to a longstanding tradition of still life &quot;memento mori&quot; painting. Each composition is most commonly based on a photograph taken by Richter in his own studio. Influenced by old master vanitas painters such as Georges de La Tour and Francisco de Zurbarán, the artist began to experiment with arrangements of candles and skulls placed in varying degrees of natural light, sitting atop otherwise barren tables. The Candle paintings coincided with his first large-scale abstract paintings, and represent the complete antithesis to those vast, colorful and playfully meaningless works. Richter has made only 27 of these still lifes. In 1995, the artist marked the 50th anniversary of the allied bombings of his hometown Dresden during the Second World War. His solitary candle was reproduced on a monumental scale and placed overlooking the River Elbe as a symbol of rejuvenation. Richter has said that while painting this series, “I did experience feelings to do with contemplation, remembering, silence, and death.”

In a 1988 series of 15 ambiguous photo paintings entitled &quot;18 October 1977&quot;, he depicted four members of the Red Army Faction (RAF), a German left-wing militant organization. These paintings were created from black-and-white newspaper and police photos. Three RAF members were found dead in their prison cells on 18 October 1977 and the cause of their deaths was the focus of widespread controversy. In the late 1980s, Richter had begun to collect images of the group which he used as the basis for the 15 paintings exhibited for the first time in Krefeld in 1989. The paintings were based on an official portrait of Ulrike Meinhof during her years as a radical journalist; on photographs of the arrest of Holger Meins; on police shots of Gudrun Ensslin in prison; on Andreas Baader&#x27;s bookshelves and the record player to conceal his gun; on the dead figures of Meinhof, Ensslin, and Baader; and on the funeral of Ensslin, Baader, and Jan-Carl Raspe.

Since 1989, Richter has worked on creating new images by dragging wet paint over photographs. The photographs, not all taken by Richter himself, are mostly snapshots of daily life: family vacations, pictures of friends, mountains, buildings, and streetscapes.

Richter was flying to New York on 11 September 2001, but due to the 9/11 attacks, including on the World Trade Center, his plane was diverted to Halifax, Nova Scotia. A few years later, he made one small painting specifically about the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. In &quot;September: A History Painting by Gerhard Richter&quot;, Robert Storr situates Richter&#x27;s 2005 painting &quot;September&quot; within a brand of anti-ideological thought that he finds throughout Richter&#x27;s work. He considers how the ubiquitous photographic documentation of 11 September attacks affects the uniqueness of one&#x27;s distinct remembrance of the events, and he offers a valuable comparison to Richter&#x27;s &quot;18 October 1977&quot; cycle.

In the 2000s, Richter made a number of works that dealt with scientific phenomena. In 2003, he produced several paintings with the same title: &quot;Silicate&quot;. Large oil-on-canvas pieces, these show latticed rows of light- and dark-grey blobs whose shapes quasi-repeat as they race across the frame, their angle modulating from painting to painting. They depict a photo, published in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, of a computer-generated simulacrum of reflections from the silicon dioxide found in insects&#x27; shells.

In 2014, Richter created a cycle of four paintings using the Sonderkommando photographs, which were taken in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp during the Holocaust, titled &quot;Birkenau&quot;. A photographic version of the Birkenau series is on display at the newly inaugurated Birkenau Museum in Auschwitz-Birkenau (Oświęcim), which opened in 2024, to commemorate the site.

===Abstract work===
Richter&#x27;s early work &quot;Table&quot; (1962) consisted of a painting of a table, taken from a photograph in a magazine, with tachiste gestural marks overlapping. Those marks can be read as cancelling the photorealist representation, using haptic swirls of grey paint, as well as a form of generativity.

In 1969, Richter produced the first of a group of grey monochromes that consist exclusively of the textures resulting from different methods of paint application.

In 1976, Richter first gave the title &quot;Abstract Painting&quot; to one of his works. By presenting a painting without even a few words to name and explain it, he felt he was &quot;letting a thing come, rather than creating it.&quot; In his abstract pictures, Richter builds up cumulative layers of non-representational painting, beginning with brushing big swaths of primary color onto canvas. The paintings evolve in stages, based on his responses to the picture&#x27;s progress: the incidental details and patterns that emerge. Throughout his process, Richter uses the same techniques he uses in his representational paintings, blurring and scraping to veil and expose prior layers.

From the mid-1980s, Richter began to use a homemade squeegee to rub and scrape the paint that he had applied in large bands across his canvases. In an interview with Benjamin H.D. Buchloch in 1986, Richter was asked about his &quot;Monochrome Grey Pictures and Abstract Pictures&quot; and their connection with the artists Yves Klein and Ellsworth Kelly. The following are Richter&#x27;s answers:
The Grey Pictures were done at a time when there were monochrome paintings everywhere. I painted them nonetheless. ... Not Kelly, but Bob Ryman, Brice Marden, Alan Charlton, Yves Klein and many others.
In the 1990s the artist began to run his squeegee up and down the canvas in an ordered fashion to produce vertical columns that take on the look of a wall of planks.

Richter&#x27;s abstract work and its illusion of space developed out of his incidental process: an accumulation of spontaneous, reactive gestures of adding, moving, and subtracting paint. Despite unnatural palettes, spaceless sheets of color, and obvious trails of the artist&#x27;s tools, the abstract pictures often act like windows through which we see the landscape outside. As in his representational paintings, there is an equalization of illusion and paint. In those paintings, he reduces worldly images to mere incidents of Art. Similarly, in his abstract pictures, Richter exalts spontaneous, intuitive mark-making to a level of spatial logic and believability.

&quot;Firenze&quot; continues a cycle of 99 works conceived in the autumn of 1999 and executed in the same year and thereafter. This series belongs to the body of work of the overpainted photographs, or übermalte Fotographien, counting more than 2,000 pieces. &quot;Firenze&quot; consists of small paintings bearing images of the city of Florence, created by the artist as a tribute to the music of Steve Reich and the work of Contempoartensemble, a Florence-based group of musicians.

After 2000, Richter made a number of works that dealt with scientific phenomena, in particular, with aspects of reality that cannot be seen by the naked eye. In 2006, Richter conceived six paintings as a coherent group under the title &quot;Cage&quot;, named after the American avant-garde composer John Cage. The &quot;Cage&quot; paintings are large works constructed from intersecting fields, lines, and swaths of uneven smears that reflect the broad squeegee tool which Richter drags across the canvases, before removing areas of paint to generate a subtractive method of concealing and revealing variegated layers and patches. In May 2002, Richter photographed 216 details of his abstract painting no. 648-2, from 1987. Working on a long table over a period of several weeks, Richter combined these 10 x 15 cm details with 165 texts on the Iraq war, published in the German &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; newspaper on 20 and 21 March. This work was published in 2004 as a book entitled &quot;War Cut&quot;.

In November 2008, Richter began a series in which he applied ink droplets to wet paper, using alcohol and lacquer to extend and retard the ink&#x27;s natural tendency to bloom and creep. The resulting &quot;November&quot; sheets are regarded as a significant departure from his previous watercolours in that the pervasive soaking of ink into wet paper produced double-sided works. Sometimes, the uppermost sheets bled into others, generating a sequentially developing series of images. In a few cases, Richter applied lacquer to one side of the sheet, or drew pencil lines across the patches of colour.

===Color chart paintings===
As early as 1966, Richter had made paintings based on colour charts. For these works, he drew inspirations from using the charts as found objects, which arranged rectangles of colors in an apparently limitless variety of hues. Richter&#x27;s experiments culminated in 1973-74 in a series of large-format pictures, such as &quot;256 Colours&quot;. Between 1966 and 1974, Richter painted three series of &quot;Color Chart&quot; works, each growing more ambitious in its attempt to create meaning through the purely arbitrary arrangement of colors. The artist began his investigations into the complex permutations of color charts in 1966, with a small painting entitled &quot;10 Colors&quot;. The charts provided anonymous and impersonal source material, a way for Richter to disassociate color from any traditional, descriptive, symbolic or expressive end. When he began to make these paintings, Richter had his friend Blinky Palermo randomly call out colors, which Richter then adopted for his work. Chance thus plays its role in the creation of his first series.

Returning to color charts in the 1970s, Richter changed his focus from the readymade to the conceptual system, developing mathematical procedures for mixing colors and employing chance operations for their placement. The range of the colors he employed was determined by a mathematical system for mixing the primary colors in graduated amounts. Each color was then randomly ordered to create the resultant composition and form of the painting. Richter&#x27;s second series of Color Charts was begun in 1971 and consisted of only five paintings. In the final series of Color Charts which preoccupied Richter throughout 1973 and 1974, additional elements to this permutational system of color production were added in the form of mixes of a light grey, a dark gray and later, a green.

Richter&#x27;s &quot;4900 Colours&quot; from 2007 consisted of bright monochrome squares that have been randomly arranged in a grid pattern to create stunning fields of kaleidoscopic color. It was produced at the same time he developed his design for the south transept window of Cologne Cathedral. &quot;4900 Colours&quot; consists of 196 panels in 25 colors that can be reassembled in 11 variations – from a single expansive surface to multiple small-format fields. Richter developed &quot;Version II&quot; – 49 paintings, each of which measures 97 by 97 centimeters – especially for the Serpentine Gallery.

===Sculpture===
Richter began to use glass in his work in 1967, when he made &quot;Four Panes of Glass&quot;. These plain sheets of glass could tilt away from the poles on which they were mounted at an angle that changed from one installation to the next. In 1970, he and Blinky Palermo jointly submitted designs for the sports facilities for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. For the front of the arena, they proposed an array of glass windows in twenty-seven different colors; each color would appear fifty times, with the distribution determined randomly. In 1981, for a two-person show with Georg Baselitz in Düsseldorf, Richter produced the first of the monumental transparent mirrors that appear intermittently thereafter in his oeuvre; the mirrors are significantly larger than Richter&#x27;s paintings and feature adjustable steel mounts. For pieces such as &quot;Mirror Painting (Grey, 735-2)&quot; (1991), the mirrors were coloured grey by coating the back of the glass with pigment. Arranged in two rooms, Richter presented an ensemble of paintings and colored mirrors in a special pavilion designed in collaboration with architect Paul Robbrecht at Documenta 9 in Kassel in 1992.

In 2002, for the Dia Art Foundation, Richter created a glass sculpture in which seven parallel panes of glass refract light and the world beyond, offering altered visions of the exhibition space; &quot;Spiegel I&quot; (Mirror I) and &quot;Spiegel II&quot; (Mirror II), a two-part mirror piece from 1989 that measures 7&#x27; tall and 18&#x27; feet long, which alters the boundaries of the environment and again changes one&#x27;s visual experience of the gallery; and &quot;Kugel&quot; (Sphere), 1992, a stainless steel sphere that acts as a mirror, reflecting the space. Since 2002, the artist has created a series of three dimensional glass constructions, such as &quot;6 Standing Glass Panels&quot; (2002/2011).

===Drawings===
In 2010, the Drawing Center showed &quot;Lines which do not exist&quot;, a survey of Richter&#x27;s drawings from 1966 to 2005, including works made using mechanical intervention such as attaching a pencil to an electric hand drill. It was the first career overview of Richter in the United States since &quot;40 Years of Painting&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in 2002. In a review of &quot;Lines which do not exist&quot;, R. H. Lossin wrote in &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot;: &quot;Viewed as a personal (and possibly professional) deficiency, Richter&#x27;s drawing practice consisted of diligently documenting something that didn&#x27;t work—namely a hand that couldn&#x27;t draw properly. ...Richter displaces the concept of the artist&#x27;s hand with hard evidence of his own, wobbly, failed, and very material appendage.&quot;

===Commissions===
Throughout his career, Richter has mostly declined lucrative licensing deals and private commissions. Measuring 9 by 9 ½ feet and depicting both the Milan Duomo and the square&#x27;s 19th-century Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, &quot;Domplatz, Mailand&quot; (1968) was a commission from Siemens, and it hung in that company&#x27;s offices in Milan from 1968 to 1998. (In 1998, Sotheby&#x27;s sold it in London, where it fetched what was then a record price for Richter, $3.6 million). In 1980, Richter and Isa Genzken were commissioned to design the König-Heinrich-Platz underground station in Duisburg; it was only completed in 1992. In 1986, Richter received a commission for two large-scale paintings – &quot;Victoria I&quot; and &quot;Victoria II&quot; – from the Victoria insurance company in Düsseldorf. In 1990, along with Sol LeWitt and Oswald Mathias Ungers, he created works for the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank in Düsseldorf. In 1998, he installed a wall piece based on the colours of Germany&#x27;s flag in the rebuilt Reichstag in Berlin. In 2012 he was asked to design the first page of the German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot;. In 2017 Richter designed the label of the 2015 Chateau Mouton Rothschild&#x27;s first wine of that year.

===Church windows===
In 2002, the same year as his MoMA retrospective, Richter was asked to design a stained glass window in the Cologne Cathedral.
In August 2007, his window was unveiled. It is an abstract collage of 11,500 pixel-like squares in 72 colors, randomly arranged by computer (with some symmetry), reminiscent of his 1974 painting &quot;4096 colours&quot;. The artist waived any fee, and the costs of materials and mounting the window came to around €370,000 ($506,000), covered by donations from more than 1,000 people. Cardinal Joachim Meisner did not attend the window&#x27;s unveiling as he would have preferred it to have been a figurative representation of 20th century Christian martyrs and said that Richter&#x27;s window would fit better in a mosque or other prayer house. A professed atheist with &quot;a strong leaning towards Catholicism&quot;, Richter had his three children with his third wife baptized in the Cologne Cathedral.

In September 2020, Richter unveiled his three 30-foot-tall stained-glass windows for the Tholey Abbey, one of the oldest monasteries in Germany. He called them his last major work, adding that he would focus on drawings and sketches from then on. The large choir windows were made by Gustva van Treeck, an esteemed glass workshop in nearby Munich. They are abstract painted works inspired by his &quot;Pattern&quot; series from the 1990s. An additional 34 figurative stained glass windows designed for the abbey by Afghan-German Muslim artist Mahbuba Maqsoodi are expected to be completed by Easter 2021. The monks of the abbey hoped the windows would promote tourism to the abbey and its town and bring people into the faith.

==Exhibitions==
Richter first began exhibiting in Düsseldorf in 1963. Richter had his first gallery solo show in 1964 at Galerie Schmela in Düsseldorf. Soon after, he had exhibitions in Munich and Berlin and by the early 1970s exhibited frequently throughout Europe and the United States. In 1966, Bruno Bischofberger was the first to show Richter&#x27;s works outside Germany. Richter&#x27;s first retrospective took place at the Kunsthalle Bremen in 1976 and covered works from 1962 to 1974. A traveling retrospective at Düsseldorf&#x27;s Kunsthalle in 1986 was followed in 1991 by a retrospective at the Tate Gallery, London. In 1993, he received a major touring retrospective &quot;Gerhard Richter: Malerei 1962–1993&quot; curated by Kasper König, with a three volume catalogue edited by Benjamin Buchloh. This exhibition containing 130 works carried out over the course of thirty years, was to entirely reinvent Richter&#x27;s career.

Richter became known to a U.S. audience in 1990, when the Saint Louis Art Museum circulated &quot;Baader-Meinhof (18 October 1977)&quot;, a show that that was later seen at the Lannan Foundation in Marina del Rey, California. Richter&#x27;s first North American retrospective was in 1998 at the Art Gallery of Ontario and at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. In 2002, a 40-year retrospective of Richter&#x27;s work was held at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C. His work is included in the permanent collections of several museum institutions in the US, such as the Pérez Art Museum Miami.

He has participated in several international art shows, including the Venice Biennale (1972, 1980, 1984, 1997 and 2007), as well as Documenta V (1972), VII (1982), VIII (1987), IX (1992), and X (1997). In 2006, an exhibition at the Getty Center connected the landscapes of Richter to the Romantic pictures of Caspar David Friedrich, showing that both artists &quot;used abstraction, expansiveness, and emptiness to express transcendent emotion through painting.&quot;

The Gerhard Richter Archive was established in cooperation with the artist in 2005 as an institute of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. In 2020, Gerhard Richter established the Gerhard Richter Art Foundation, a non-profit foundation dedicated to preserving his work and making it available for exhibitions.

The first major exhibition of his work in Australia, &quot;Gerhard Richter: The Life of Images&quot;, was mounted by the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane from 14 October 2017 to 4 February 2018. It included more than 90 works, including the newly created &quot;Atlas Overview&quot;, a 400-panel extract selected by Richter from the larger &quot;Atlas&quot; project now deemed too fragile for loan or travel.
In 2022, the Raphael Durazzo Gallery exhibited 2014: &quot;20. November 2014&quot;, oil on colored photograph, 15 x 10 cm.

==Recognition==
Although Richter gained popularity and critical praise throughout his whole career, his fame burgeoned during his 2005 retrospective exhibition, which declared his place among the most important artists of the 20th century. Today, many call Gerhard Richter the best living painter. In part, this comes from his ability to explore the medium at a time when many were heralding its death. Richter has been the recipient of numerous prominent awards, including the State Prize of the state North Rhine-Westphalia, 2000; the Wexner Prize, 1998; the Praemium Imperiale, Japan, 1997; the Golden Lion of the 47th Biennale, Venice, 1997; the Wolf Prize, Israel, 1994/5; the Goslarer Kaiserring Prize der Stadt Goslar, Mönchehaus-Museum für Moderne Kunst, Goslar, Germany, 1988; the Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Vienna, 1985; the Arnold Bode Prize, Kassel, 1981; and the Junger Western Art Prize, Germany, 1961. He was made an honorary citizen of Cologne in April 2007. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2012.

===Influence===
Among the students who studied with Richter at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf between 1971 and 1994 were Ludger Gerdes, Hans-Jörg Holubitschka, Bernard Lokai, Thomas Schütte, Thomas Struth, Katrin Kneffel, Michael van Ofen, and Richter&#x27;s second wife, Isa Genzken. He is known to have influenced Ellsworth Kelly, Christopher Wool and Johan Andersson.

He has also served as source of inspiration for writers and musicians. Sonic Youth used a painting of his for the cover art for their album &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; in 1988. He was a fan of the band and did not charge for the use of his image. The original, over square, is now showcased in Sonic Youth&#x27;s studio in NYC. Don DeLillo&#x27;s short story &quot;Baader-Meinhof&quot; describes an encounter between two strangers at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The meeting takes place in the room displaying &quot;18 October 1977&quot; (1988).

Photographer Cotton Coulson described Richter as &quot;one of [his] favourite artists&quot;.

For the last 18 years, Gerhard Richter has been the number one on a Kunstkompass scale of most important world artists, made by a German magazine Capital.

===Position in the art market===
Following an exhibition with Blinky Palermo at Galerie Heiner Friedrich in 1971, Richter&#x27;s formal arrangement with the dealer came to an end in 1972. Thereafter, Friedrich was only entitled to sell the paintings that he had already obtained contractually from Richter. In the following years, Richter showed with Galerie Konrad Fischer, Düsseldorf, and Sperone Westwater, New York. Richter&#x27;s primary dealer and representative gallery between 1985 and 2022 was Marian Goodman. Since December 2022, Richter is represented by David Zwirner Gallery. 
Today, museums own roughly 38% of Richter&#x27;s works, including half of his large abstract paintings. By 2004, Richter&#x27;s annual turnover was $120 million. At the same time, his works often appear at auction. According to artnet, an online firm that tracks the art market, $76.9 million worth of Richter&#x27;s work was sold at auction in 2010. Richter&#x27;s high turnover volume reflects his prolificacy as well as his popularity. As of 2012, no fewer than 545 distinct Richter&#x27;s works had sold at auctions for more than $100,000. 15 of them had sold for more than $10,000,000 between 2007 and 2012. Richter&#x27;s paintings have been flowing steadily out of Germany since the mid-1990s even as certain important German collectors – Frieder Burda, Josef Fröhlich, Georg Böckmann, and Ulrich Ströher – have held on to theirs.

Richter&#x27;s candle paintings were the first to command high auction prices. Three months after his MoMA exhibition opened in 2001, Sotheby&#x27;s sold his &quot;Three Candles&quot; (1982) for $5.3 million. In February 2008, the artist&#x27;s eldest daughter, Betty, sold her &quot;Kerze&quot; (1983) for £7,972,500 ($15 million), triple the high estimate, at Sotheby&#x27;s in London. His 1982 &quot;Kerze (Candle)&quot; sold for £10.5 million ($16.5 million) at Christie&#x27;s London in October 2011.

In February 2008, Christie&#x27;s London set a first record for Richter&#x27;s &quot;capitalist realism&quot; pictures from the 1960s by selling the painting &quot;Zwei Liebespaare&quot; (1966) for £7,300,500 ($14.3 million) to Stephan Schmidheiny. In 2010, the Weserburg modern art museum in Bremen, Germany, decided to sell Richter&#x27;s 1966 painting &quot;Matrosen&quot; (Sailors) in a November auction held by Sotheby&#x27;s, where John D. Arnold bought it for $13 million. &quot;Vierwaldstätter See&quot;, the largest of a distinct series of four views of Lake Lucerne painted by Richter in 1969, sold for £15.8 million ($24 million) at Christie&#x27;s London in 2015.

Another coveted group of works is the &quot;Abstrakte Bilder&quot; series, particularly those made after 1988, which are finished with a large squeegee rather than a brush or roller. At Pierre Bergé &amp; Associés in July 2009, Richter&#x27;s 1979 oil painting &quot;Abstraktes Bild&quot; exceeded its estimate, selling for €95,000 ($136,000). Richter&#x27;s &quot;Abstraktes Bild&quot;, of 1990 was made the top price of 7.2 million pounds, or about $11.6 million, at a Sotheby&#x27;s sale in February 2011 to a bidder who was said by dealers to be an agent for the New York dealer Larry Gagosian. In November 2011, Sotheby&#x27;s sold a group of colorful abstract canvases by Richter, including &quot;Abstraktes Bild 849-3&quot;, which made a record price for the artist at auction when Lily Safra paid $20.8 million only to donate it to the Israel Museum afterwards. Months later, a record $21.8 million was paid at Christie&#x27;s for the 1993 painting &quot;Abstraktes Bild 798-3&quot;. &quot;Abstraktes Bild (809–4)&quot;, one of the artist&#x27;s abstract canvases from 1994, was sold by Eric Clapton at Sotheby&#x27;s to a telephone bidder for $34.2 million in late 2012. (It had been estimated to bring $14.1 million to $18.8 million.)

This was exceeded in May 2013 when his 1968 piece &quot;Domplatz, Mailand&quot; (Cathedral square, Milan) was sold for $37.1 million (£24.4 million) in New York. This was further exceeded in February 2015 when his 1986 painting &quot;Abstraktes Bild (599)&quot; sold for $44.52 million (£30.4 million) in London at Sotheby&#x27;s Contemporary Evening Sale. This was the highest price at auction of a piece of contemporary art at the time; Richter&#x27;s record was broken on 12 November 2013 when Jeff Koons&#x27; &quot;Balloon Dog (Orange)&quot;, sold at Christie&#x27;s Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale in New York City for US$58.4 million.

When asked about art prices like these, Richter said &quot;It&#x27;s just as absurd as the banking crisis. It&#x27;s impossible to understand and it&#x27;s !&quot;

===Film===

In 2003, Gerald Fox made a documentary on the life of Gerhard Richter in which he starred. In &quot;2007&quot;, Corinna Belz made a short film called &quot;Gerhard Richter&#x27;s Window.&quot; In 2011, Belz&#x27;s feature-length documentary entitled &quot;Gerhard Richter Painting&quot; was released. The film focused almost entirely on the world&#x27;s highest paid living artist producing his large-scale abstract squeegee works in his studio. The 2018 drama film &quot;Never Look Away&quot; is inspired by Richter&#x27;s life story.

In 2016 and 2019 Richter worked again with Corinna Belz on two films based on his 2012 book &quot;Patterns&quot;. The previous piece named &quot;Richters Patterns&quot; when shown is partnered with music by the German composer Marcus Schmickler, the later by the American composer Steve Reich, both performed by a live ensemble. The later work in turn is part of a larger two-section collaboration, &quot;Reich Richter Pärt&quot; which was commissioned for the inaugural season at The Shed in the Hudson Yards development in Manhattan in New York City.

<doc id="810519" wikidata="Q3270346" url="?curid=810519" title="New King James Version">
<text>The New King James Version (NKJV) is a translation of the Bible in contemporary English. Published by Thomas Nelson, the complete NKJV was released in 1982. With regard to its textual basis, the NKJV relies on a modern critical edition (the &quot;Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia&quot;) for the Old Testament, while opting to use the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; for the New Testament.

The NKJV is described by Thomas Nelson as being &quot;scrupulously faithful to the original King James Version, yet truly updated to enhance its clarity and readability.&quot;

== History ==

The text for the New Testament was published in 1979; the Psalms in 1980; and the full Bible in 1982. The project took seven years in total to complete. A minor revision was completed in 1984.

== Translation philosophy ==
The Executive Editor of the NKJV, Arthur L. Farstad, addressed textual concerns in a book explaining the NKJV translation philosophy. He defended the Majority Text (also called the Byzantine text-type) and claimed that the Textus Receptus is inferior to the Majority Text, but he noted (p. 114) that the NKJV references significant discrepancies among text types in its marginal notes: &quot;None of the three [textual] traditions on every page of the New Testament [...] is labeled &#x27;best&#x27; or &#x27;most reliable.&#x27; The reader is permitted to make up his or her own mind about the correct reading.&quot;

== Circulation ==
The NKJV translation has become one of the best-selling Bibles in the US. it is listed as the sixth best selling Bible by the ECPA (Evangelical Christian Publishers Association).

An unabridged audiobook version called &quot;The Word of Promise Audio Bible&quot; has been produced by the publisher. It is narrated by celebrities and fully dramatized with music and sound effects.

Gideons International, an organization that places Bibles in hotels and hospitals, at one stage used the NKJV translation along with the KJV, offering the KJV as the default translation and offering the NKJV when an organization asked for a Bible in newer English to be used. After HarperCollins&#x27; acquisition of Thomas Nelson, however, the Gideons have chosen to start using the English Standard Version (ESV) instead of the NKJV.

<doc id="810528" wikidata="Q7155121" url="?curid=810528" title="Paulini">
<text>Pauline Curuenavuli (born 15 October 1982), known professionally as Paulini, is a Fijian-Australian singer, songwriter and musical theatre actress. Born in Suva, Paulini moved to Sydney with her family at the age of four. She rose to fame in 2003 as a contestant on the first season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and placed fourth in the competition. After &quot;Idol&quot;, Paulini signed a recording contract with Sony BMG Australia and released her debut studio album &quot;One Determined Heart&quot; (2004), which debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum. The album included the platinum single &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, which spent three consecutive weeks at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart. Paulini received two ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards for both the album and single.

In 2006, Paulini released her second studio album &quot;Superwoman&quot;, which failed to match the commercial success of her debut album. Despite this, the album included the top-thirty single &quot;Rough Day&quot; and earned Paulini two nominations at the Australia/New Zealand Urban Music Awards. That same year, Paulini achieved commercial success again as a member of the Australian girl group Young Divas. The group released two top-ten albums, &quot;Young Divas&quot; (2006) and &quot;New Attitude&quot; (2007), and achieved three top-fifteen singles, including the hugely successful &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot;. After Paulini parted ways with the Young Divas and ended her contract with Sony BMG in 2008, she focused more on songwriting. Through a publishing deal with independent label Albert Music, Paulini was able to travel and write songs in Europe, New York and Los Angeles. She wrote songs for several recording artists in Europe, South Africa and the Philippines.

Aside from her songwriting work, Paulini continued to release singles independently between 2009 and 2013. She was also featured on the 2010 single &quot;Believe Again&quot; by Irish recording artist Ronan Keating. Paulini released her third and fourth studio albums, &quot;Come Alive&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, both in 2015 through a joint record deal with Ambition and Decca Records Australia. &quot;Come Alive&quot; was a moderate success, debuting at number 25 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In 2017, Paulini made her musical theatre debut in the Australian production of &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, playing the lead role of Rachel Marron—originally portrayed by Whitney Houston in the 1992 film of the same name.

==Early life==
Paulini Curuenavuli was born in Suva, Fiji on 15 October 1982 to parents Isireli, a former choir conductor, and Miliana, a nurse. Her mother Miliana lived and worked alone in Sydney, Australia for two years. Paulini, her five siblings and their father Isireli moved from Fiji to Sydney in 1986, when she was four years old, to join Miliana. Their first home in Australia was a two-bedroom apartment in Randwick, New South Wales, where Paulini attended Coogee Public School. The family later moved to a south-western Sydney suburb, close to the Fijian church they regularly attended. Paulini is the youngest of six siblings; she has three brothers and two sisters. Paulini&#x27;s eldest brother was shot and killed during a robbery incident in 1990. She recorded a cover of Luba&#x27;s &quot;Every Time I See Your Picture I Cry&quot;, in her brother&#x27;s memory, for her third album &quot;Come Alive&quot; (2015). Paulini and her family began singing and playing instruments from a young age, despite not being classically trained in music. Their father taught Paulini and her siblings how to harmonise. At the age of 10, Paulini&#x27;s father encouraged her to showcase her singing abilities at a church talent quest. It was during this moment Paulini realised that singing is &quot;what I wanted to do with my life.&quot; Aside from singing, Paulini also had a passion for playing netball.

As a teenager, Paulini attended Bankstown Girls High School, where she was selected to perform at the Bankstown Millennium Buzz spectacular, held in 2000 to celebrate the Sydney Olympics. As a result of her performance, she was chosen to be a member of the first Bankstown Talent Advance Program (TAP), which enables students to gain confidence and learn important skills in the performing arts from an expert team. Being part of the program helped Paulini to build up her confidence because she was a shy teenager, and it eventually led to her winning the TV talent show &quot;StarStruck&quot; in 2001. Following her win, Paulini recorded a cover version of the Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey duet &quot;When You Believe&quot; for the show&#x27;s soundtrack album. With the involvement of her high school music department, Paulini was also a participant in Sydney&#x27;s annual Schools Spectacular variety show. After leaving high school, Paulini worked in a retail clothing store and became a full-time musician. In February 2003, Paulini became a member of the Fijian band Mixx. She was one of the vocalists for the band alongside her sisters Litia and Sereima, as well as other vocalists Mansus Knight, Aporosa Vakanawa and Biannca Kotobalavu. Other members of Mixx included Ben Kotobalavu on drums, his brother Rowland on bass, Jona Uluinaceva and Henry Foon on keyboards, Apakuki Nayacakalou as the guitarist, and Rupeni Davui on percussion. The band played gigs around Sydney and were even invited to perform at the opening of the 2003 South Pacific Games in Fiji. Paulini recorded the anthem &quot;Many Rhythms, One Love&quot; for the South Pacific Games&#x27; official album, &quot;The Pacific at Its Best&quot;. She eventually left Mixx later that year to audition for the first season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;.

== Music career ==

=== 2003: &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and gold dress controversy ===
In 2003, Paulini successfully auditioned for the first season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, and progressed through to the theatre rounds. Following the theatre round process, Paulini had advanced through to the semi-finals and eventually made it into the top twelve. Throughout the season, Paulini continued to impress the judges and viewers with her performances of songs by Aretha Franklin, Barbra Streisand, Thelma Houston, Toni Braxton and Etta James. In the final five-week, following her rendition of Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s &quot;Survivor&quot;, male judges Mark Holden and Ian Dickson were not impressed with the tight-fitted gold dress Paulini wore for the performance. Dicko commented on the dress saying &quot;You should choose more appropriate clothes or shed some pounds&quot;, which resulted in a great deal of debate and controversy in the media relating to self-esteem and body image of teenage girls. After hearing Dicko&#x27;s comments, Paulini went backstage and cried. In an interview with &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; magazine, 11 years after the comment was made, Paulini stated &quot;It affected me a lot and it really hurt my confidence.&quot; In the final four-week, Paulini was eliminated from the competition. According to a poll taken on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, Paulini&#x27;s elimination was the second most surprising elimination in the show&#x27;s history.

Nick Bond of News.com.au described Dicko&#x27;s criticism of Paulini&#x27;s gold dress as &quot;one of the most controversial moments in &quot;Australian Idol&quot; history,&quot; while Andrew Bucklow from the same publication labelled it one of the show&#x27;s &quot;most infamous moments&quot; ever. During Dicko&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot; in 2012, he revealed that &quot;people were virtually spitting on me&quot; after that &quot;Australian Idol&quot; episode had aired, calling it a defining moment for him because he &quot;became a national pariah&quot; overnight. In an episode of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot; and in reference to the gold dress controversy, Dicko made a statue of someone wearing a gold dress with the word &quot;sorry&quot; printed on it. Paulini appeared in the episode to see what Dicko had made and she accepted his apology. In 2014, Dicko told &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; that he does not regret what he said to Paulini, saying &quot;It&#x27;s part of who I am and who Paulini is and it binds us together.&quot; In July 2017, Dicko apologised again in a pre-recorded message he left for Paulini during her radio interview on Hot 91.1 FM&#x27;s breakfast show, &quot;Dave, Sam &amp; Ash&quot;. In the message, Dicko said &quot;I was trying to be nice at the time, can you believe, but I&#x27;m glad that you&#x27;ve gone on to do such great things.&quot; After joking that his &quot;cruel little words&quot; turned them &quot;into Australian reality TV&#x27;s power couple&quot;, he ended his message by telling Paulini, &quot;what I want to say is, I&#x27;m so proud of you girl, you go get&#x27;em.&quot;

===2004–05: &quot;One Determined Heart&quot; and EP release===
Following her departure on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, Paulini signed a recording contract with Sony Music Australia, which later merged with the show&#x27;s sponsor BMG Records. Her debut studio album &quot;One Determined Heart&quot; was released on 23 July 2004; it debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, where it remained for two consecutive weeks, and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 70,000 units. The album was produced by Audius Mtawarira, and was mainly a collection of covers, featuring only two original tracks. A cover of The Jeff Healey Band&#x27;s 1989 hit &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; was released as the first single from &quot;One Determined Heart&quot;. It peaked at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart, where it remained for three consecutive weeks, and was certified platinum. &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; remained in the top ten for two months, and became the fourth-highest-selling Australian single of 2004. Paulini won two ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards for both the album and single. &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; was also nominated for Highest Selling Single at the 2004 ARIA Music Awards. Original track &quot;We Can Try&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single, and peaked at number 30. The song had better success on the ARIA Urban Singles Chart, where it reached number nine.

In July and August 2004, Paulini was the supporting act for Human Nature&#x27;s seven-date tour on the East Coast. Paulini&#x27;s first extended play, &quot;Amazing Grace: Songs for Christmas&quot;, was released on 26 November 2004, featuring covers of popular Christmas tunes. The EP peaked at number 70 on the ARIA Albums Chart and number seven on the ARIA Urban Albums Chart. That same month, Paulini served as a supporting act for Tina Arena&#x27;s Greatest Hits Tour. She was also the supporting act for Guy Sebastian&#x27;s Beautiful Life Tour from March to June 2005.

=== 2006–08: &quot;Superwoman&quot; and Young Divas ===

Sony BMG announced in April 2005 that Paulini had finished recording her then-upcoming second studio album. However, Sony BMG decided to wait nearly 18 months before releasing the album, which sparked rumours that Paulini was being dropped from the label. After several false release dates and pushbacks, &quot;Superwoman&quot; was released on 5 August 2006. Featuring mostly original material, the album was recorded in Sydney, Los Angeles, London and Barcelona. Upon its release, &quot;Superwoman&quot; debuted at number 72 and failed to match the commercial success of Paulini&#x27;s first album. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Rough Day&quot; was a moderate success, peaking at number 26, while the second single &quot;So Over You&quot; peaked at number 49. The third and final single &quot;I Believe&quot; had a limited radio release. Despite the underperformance of &quot;Superwoman&quot;, the album earned Paulini two nominations at the Australia/New Zealand Urban Music Awards for Best Female Artist and Best R&amp;B Album.

Throughout most of 2006, Paulini was part of the all-girl singing project Young Divas with former &quot;Australian Idol&quot; contestants Ricki-Lee Coulter, Emily Williams and Kate DeAraugo. The project was initially formed to promote a joint 17-date national tour, where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group. Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer&#x27;s 1989 single &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot;, through Sony BMG, to promote tickets for the tour. A music video was also shot to accompany the song&#x27;s release. In an interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Coulter stated &quot;We really want to get across that we&#x27;re not a group. It&#x27;s four big personalities and big voices getting on stage and showing what they can do. That was the idea behind the single—kind of showing off all of our vocals, together.&quot; Young Divas&#x27; version of &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot; peaked at number two, remained in the top-ten for 14 consecutive weeks, and was certified platinum. Five months after the single&#x27;s release, Young Divas released a second single in November 2006, a cover of Lonnie Gordon&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;Happenin&#x27; All Over Again&quot;. The song peaked at number nine and was certified gold for shipments of 35,000 units. Young Divas&#x27; commercial success prompted the release of a self-titled debut album of classic disco and pop covers, on 27 November 2006, establishing themselves as an official group. The album debuted at number four and was certified double platinum for shipments of 140,000 units. A cover of Hazell Dean&#x27;s 1983 hit &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot; was released as the group&#x27;s third single, and reached number 40.

Coulter left the Young Divas in June 2007 to resume her solo career, and was replaced by &quot;Australian Idol&quot; season four runner-up Jessica Mauboy. Their second studio album &quot;New Attitude&quot; was released on 24 November 2007, debuted at number 10 and was certified gold. The album was preceded by a cover of Loverboy&#x27;s 1980 single &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, which featured New Zealand rapper Savage and peaked at number 15. In December 2007, Paulini was one of the lead vocalists in the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s gospel-style production of Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot;, alongside Trace Canini and Doug Parkinson, at the Adelaide Festival Theatre. In July 2008, Paulini collaborated with Guy Sebastian on the single &quot;Receive the Power&quot;, which was chosen as the official anthem for the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s 2008 World Youth Day held in Sydney. &quot;Receive the Power&quot; was released in English and also an international version with verses in Italian, Spanish and French. Paulini and Sebastian performed both versions at the final Mass attended by 400,000 people, and also at the Pope&#x27;s Farewell. In August 2008, it was announced that Paulini had decided to quit the Young Divas in order to resume her solo career. Paulini&#x27;s manager at the time stated that her decision to leave the group &quot;is totally amicable with the other girls. She just wants to continue on with her solo career. There is no animosity, there is nothing negative.&quot; Mauboy had also decided to depart, leaving DeAraugo and Williams as the only remaining members. However, both DeAraugo and Williams resumed their solo careers, and the Young Divas officially disbanded. Following Paulini&#x27;s departure from the Young Divas, she ended her contract with Sony BMG.

=== 2009–2013: Songwriting and independent music releases ===
After signing a publishing deal with independent label Albert Music in 2009, Paulini began to focus more on songwriting. She attended songwriting camps in Europe, New York City and Los Angeles, and collaborated with many songwriters such as Allan Eshuijs. Paulini co-wrote songs for South African recording artist Sasha-Lee Davids, German girl group Monrose, Spanish recording artist Edurne, and &quot;The Voice France&quot; winner Yoann Fréget, among others. During February–March 2009 and again in October, Paulini alongside Christine Anu, Grace Knight and Monica Trapaga embarked on the Ladies of Jazz Tour in New South Wales, where they performed jazz classics from the &#x27;30s and &#x27;40s, as well as modern jazz hits. In November 2009, Paulini released the single &quot;Scarless&quot; to help raise awareness and support for White Ribbon Day, an international day to prevent violence against women. The song is based on an abusive relationship Paulini was in and was written to help other victims of domestic violence. &quot;Scarless&quot; marked the first time Paulini released music independently. On being an independent artist, Paulini told Auspop: &quot;For the first time I feel like I&#x27;m in control of my music...with the independent thing, you know exactly what you&#x27;re paying to who and you&#x27;re in control from your music to what is written, to what you release out there—you&#x27;re across it all, which is a great thing.&quot; Upon its release, &quot;Scarless&quot; debuted at number 18 on the AIR Independent Radio Chart. Paulini was featured on Irish recording artist Ronan Keating&#x27;s 2010 single &quot;Believe Again&quot;, which peaked at number 73 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was included on Keating&#x27;s album &quot;Duet&quot; (2010).

Paulini&#x27;s second independent single &quot;Show Me Your Colors (The Ping Pong Mix)&quot; was released as a digital download on 15 May 2011 to coincide with her performances at the 2011 Volkswagen Table Tennis Cup in China. In October 2011, Paulini reunited with Anu and Knight for more shows of their Ladies of Jazz Tour. Paulini&#x27;s third independent single &quot;Fireman&quot; was released digitally on 10 February 2012. The song was inspired by Paulini&#x27;s trip to New York, where she noticed a group of women &quot;screaming with excitement&quot; as a truck full of firemen drove past them. She wanted to write &quot;a cheeky song&quot; that celebrates the work firemen do. A music video, featuring shirtless real-life firefighters, was also shot to accompany the song&#x27;s release. Paulini embarked on a club tour in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane throughout February and March 2012 to promote &quot;Fireman&quot;. She also performed &quot;Fireman&quot; in New York at the 2012 Gay Pride event, Shark. Paulini&#x27;s fourth independent single &quot;Ping Pong with My Heart&quot; was released only in international markets on 20 March 2012 as the official anthem for the International Table Tennis Federation. An accompanying music video for the single was also released and features scenes of Paulini playing table tennis with a love interest. She was invited to perform &quot;Ping Pong with My Heart&quot; at actress Susan Sarandon&#x27;s New York table tennis club SPiN in June 2012. Paulini&#x27;s fifth independent single &quot;Heartbreak Is Over&quot; was released digitally on 18 January 2013.

=== 2014–2017: &quot;Come Alive&quot;, &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; musical ===

In 2014, Paulini signed a joint record deal with Ambition Records and Decca Records Australia. She became the first artist signed to the reactivated Decca Records label in Australia. Paulini released &quot;Air It All Out&quot; as the lead single from her third studio album &quot;Come Alive&quot; on 17 October 2014. Co-written by Paulini in New York, she explained that &quot;the song is about letting go of negativity, doubt and fear—breathing in and exhaling positivity and purpose.&quot; &quot;By My Side&quot; was released as the second and final single from &quot;Come Alive&quot; on 15 May 2015. Co-written in Sydney by Paulini and producer Adam Reily, &quot;By My Side&quot; was dedicated to Paulini&#x27;s older sister Litia who battled and overcame breast cancer. Paulini stated that the song is lyrically &quot;about my journey over the past few years and coming into my skin after a struggle to find my voice, my artistry and above all, loving myself with the help of loved ones by my side.&quot; Both &quot;Air It All Out&quot; and &quot;By My Side&quot; failed to make any significant impact on the ARIA charts.

Paulini&#x27;s third album &quot;Come Alive&quot; was released on 29 May 2015, almost nine years after the release of her second album &quot;Superwoman&quot; (2006). &quot;Come Alive&quot; marked a departure from Paulini&#x27;s previous R&amp;B releases, with a more commercial adult contemporary pop sound. She worked on the album for five years in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York City and Paris with several writers and producers, including Chris Rosa, Erik &quot;Blue2th&quot; Griggs and Philippe-Marc Anquetil. Paulini stated that she wanted to take her time with the album to concentrate on improving her songwriting, having co-written all but two tracks on &quot;Come Alive&quot;. &quot;Come Alive&quot; debuted at number 25 on the ARIA Albums Chart and surpassed &quot;Superwoman&quot;″s peak position of number 72.

Paulini&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; was released on 6 November 2015. It was Paulini&#x27;s first Christmas album and second overall Christmas release, following her 2004 EP, &quot;Amazing Grace: Songs for Christmas&quot;. Paulini stated that the release was her &quot;way of saying &#x27;thank you&#x27;&quot; to the fans for allowing her to perform and share the spirit of Christmas at &quot;communities all around Australia&quot; every year. Featuring cover versions of popular Christmas tunes, &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; failed to impact the ARIA charts. Paulini promoted the album with an eight-date tour at various Christmas carols events on the East Coast. Paulini was eventually dropped from Decca Records because both &quot;Come Alive&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; were not commercially successful, revealing she had lost her life savings on the failed album deals.

Paulini collaborated with the Wiggles on the song &quot;Do the Pretzel&quot; for their 2017 album &quot;Duets&quot;, and appeared in the music video included on the DVD of the same name. In April 2017, she made her musical theatre debut in the Australian production of &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, which is based on Whitney Houston&#x27;s 1992 film of the same name. Paulini played the lead role of Rachel Marron—originally portrayed by Houston in the film—a fictional pop superstar who is stalked by a fan and falls in love with her bodyguard. Paulini took acting lessons and increased her fitness to prepare for the role, which included singing and running on the treadmill at the same time. &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; musical played shows in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne from April until October 2017. Paulini&#x27;s performance in the musical was well received by critics and audiences.

=== 2018–present: Single releases and more musicals===
Paulini had lost work throughout 2018 after news broke of her fake driver&#x27;s licence scandal from the previous year, stating that all of her gigs after her stint in &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; musical were cancelled. She returned to the spotlight in 2019 when she was cast as one of the four star vocalists for the Australian production of the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; musical, based on the 1977 film of the same name. She performed songs by the Bee Gees from the film&#x27;s soundtrack for the musical at Sydney&#x27;s Lyric Theatre from March to June 2019. That same year, Paulini was also cast in the Australian production of the 1960s rock musical &quot;Hair&quot;, playing the role of Dionne. The musical played shows in Perth, Geelong, Wyong, Wollongong, Sydney and the Gold Coast from August until October 2019. Paulini&#x27;s singing in &quot;Hair&quot; received praise from critics. Paulini&#x27;s first single in five years, &quot;Twenty Twenty&quot;, was released to music streaming services on 11 December 2020 through Ambition Records. The song was written by Paulini and produced by Andro Martinez, whom she previously worked with at age 16. It is lyrically about the difficult year of 2020, particularly relating to the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic. Paulini described &quot;Twenty Twenty&quot; as a &quot;farewell 2020 anthem&quot; with a &quot;fun 90s vibe&quot;. &quot;OutInPerth&quot; called it &quot;a breakup anthem for 2020...about how it’s time to cut ties with the year of lockdowns, lost work and so much antibacterial gel.&quot;

In 2021, Paulini starred in the Australian production of the &quot;Chess&quot; musical, playing the role of Russian character Svetlana Sergievskaya. For the role, she worked with an accent coach to perfect her enunciation of performing songs in a Russian accent. The musical toured Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane from April to June 2021. Shaad D&#x27;Souza of &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt that Paulini was &quot;underused&quot; in her role, but praised her singing and brief moments in the musical, writing &quot;She brings depth and intrigue to the decidedly underwritten Svetlana, and is a much-needed anchor in the show’s second half.&quot; Paulini released the single &quot;We Are One&quot; on 3 February 2022 as her entry for the &quot;Eurovision – Australia Decides&quot; competition, where a combination of public and jury voting decide who would represent Australia in the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest. The disco-inspired dance track was written by Rick Price and John Capek, and lyrically speaks about acceptance and unity. When Paulini was sent &quot;We Are One&quot; for the competition, she tweaked some of the lyrics and reworked the track to make it sound &quot;as current, as pop, as Eurovision and as camp as it could be&quot;. She ended up finishing in sixth place out of the eleven entries with 52 votes, and Sheldon Riley was voted to represent Australia at Eurovision.

Paulini collaborated with Australian singer-songwriter Bradley McCaw on the country-rock duet &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, released as a single on 18 March 2022. She also recorded a cover version of the duet &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; from the &quot;Chess&quot; musical with Australian soprano singer Mirusia Louwerse for Louwerse&#x27;s album &quot;Songbird&quot; (2022). Their version was released as a single on 8 July 2022. That same month, Paulini was cast as one of the Divas in the Gold Coast production of the &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; musical, which played shows at The Star from 16 July until 7 August 2022. Paulini later starred in the Australian production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; as the Narrator, whose role is to narrate the musical&#x27;s entire story through song. She also had additional side roles as Joseph&#x27;s father Jacob, Potiphar&#x27;s wife, and a Jailer. The musical played shows at Melbourne&#x27;s Regent Theatre from November 2022 to January 2023, and at Sydney&#x27;s Capitol Theatre from February to April 2023. Paulini&#x27;s stage presence, acting and vocal performance in the musical received critical acclaim.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and influences===

Paulini possesses a five-octave vocal range. Her music has ranged from R&amp;B, pop-soul, dance and adult contemporary pop. Paulini&#x27;s debut album &quot;One Determined Heart&quot; (2004) is rooted in R&amp;B, but also incorporates influences of soul and funk. The album was mainly a collection of cover songs, and featured only two original tracks. Paulini&#x27;s second effort &quot;Superwoman&quot; (2006) is an R&amp;B and pop-soul album with disco influences. &quot;Superwoman&quot; was her first album to be made up of entirely original material, and lyrically explored &quot;relationships and everyday life experiences from the female perspective.&quot; Paulini experimented with dance music on her singles &quot;Fireman&quot; (2012), &quot;Heartbreak Is Over&quot; (2013) and &quot;We Are One&quot; (2022). Paulini stated that the dance releases was her trying to discover her sound and she was inspired to pursue the genre during a trip to Germany, where dance music is popular. Paulini explored adult contemporary pop on her third album &quot;Come Alive&quot; (2015) and shifted away from the R&amp;B sounds of her previous albums. She described &quot;Come Alive&quot; as her most personal album, as its lyrical content are based on the personal life experiences of her and her friends.
Paulini named Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as her biggest musical influences growing up, stating that &quot;they demanded attention when they would get up on stage and that is what I have always wanted when I get up and perform.&quot; She also cited Beyoncé as an inspiration for performing, and Oprah Winfrey for &quot;her courage, talent and life lessons.&quot; Paulini listed Beyoncé and Aretha Franklin as vocal inspirations for her album &quot;Superwoman&quot; (2006).

===Songwriting===
Paulini uses life experiences her and her friends and family have gone through as inspiration for writing songs, and tries to keep the lyrics as honest as possible. She began writing songs before entering &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, but stated that she had &quot;stopped and just did the projects I was told to do,&quot; referring to her first two albums released through Sony BMG. Paulini had no songwriting credits on her debut album &quot;One Determined Heart&quot; (2004), and co-wrote only two tracks on her second album &quot;Superwoman&quot; (2006). In an interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Paulini revealed that she felt manufactured with her first two albums, saying: &quot;You kind of actually feel trapped because when they would ask you to make an album, they&#x27;d have a list of songs ready for you to choose from. It was like a massive list of just songs that other people have written that you can just kind of go, &#x27;Oh yeah. I like that one. I like the sound of this.&#x27; It just didn&#x27;t seem real. I mean, it wasn&#x27;t real for me. They were all great songs and written by awesome writers. But, they weren&#x27;t my words and my experiences; I didn&#x27;t feel like it belonged to me.&quot; Paulini was heavily involved with the songwriting on her third album &quot;Come Alive&quot; (2015), having co-written all but two tracks on the album. She referred to &quot;Come Alive&quot; as her first real album as she took her time working on it, explaining that with &quot;this one, this is me. Every experience in there is me, it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve gone through, or what I&#x27;ve interpreted from my point of view with other situations with my friends and family.&quot;

After signing a publishing deal with independent label Albert Music in 2009, Paulini began writing songs for other recording artists. She co-wrote &quot;I&#x27;m Only Human&quot; for German recording artist Cherine Nouri&#x27;s album &quot;So Alive&quot; (2009), the 2011 single &quot;Touching a Stranger&quot; for Allan Eshuijs&#x27; project Wildboyz, and the 2014 single &quot;Just Like You&quot; for &quot;The Voice Philippines&quot; finalist Jessica Reynoso. She also co-wrote &quot;Definition of a Woman&quot; for both South African recording artist Sasha-Lee Davids and German girl group Monrose. &quot;Scarless&quot; was translated into Spanish (&quot;Culpable&quot;) for Spanish recording artist Edurne&#x27;s album &quot;Nueva Piel&quot; (2010). Another song Paulini wrote, &quot;Good Morning, Good People&quot;, was translated into French (&quot;Bienvenue dans ma maison&quot;) for &quot;The Voice France&quot; winner Yoann Fréget&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Quelques heures avec moi&quot; (2014).

==Other ventures==
===Television appearances===
On 26 November 2004, Paulini made a guest appearance in the Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; as herself. In the episode, Paulini performs her single &quot;We Can Try&quot; at the opening of Summer Bay&#x27;s new bar Noah&#x27;s, and later performs &quot;Silent Night&quot; at the christening for Sally Fletcher&#x27;s (Kate Ritchie) baby. Paulini appeared as a contestant in the first season of the Australian lifestyle reality series &quot;Celebrity Overhaul&quot; in February 2005, alongside six other celebrities. On the show, celebrities went through a six-week course of fitness and lifestyle retraining. In May 2006, Paulini joined the first season of the celebrity singing show &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, where 10 non-singing celebrities are paired up with 10 professional singers to compete in a duet-singing showdown in order to impress a panel of judges and the viewing public to survive potential elimination. Paulini was paired up with television presenter Simon Reeve, and they placed sixth in the competition. For the second season of &quot;It Takes Two&quot; in May 2007, she was paired up with television presenter Lochie Daddo and they were the first couple to be eliminated from the competition. Paulini made her acting debut in the television film &quot;Sisters of War&quot;, which premiered on ABC1 on 14 November 2010. The film is based on the true story of a group of Australian nuns and nurses held by the Japanese as prisoners of war at the Catholic mission station Vunapope, on the Papua New Guinea island of New Britain in 1942. Paulini played the supporting role of islander nun Sister Marie, who she described as caring and strong. In preparing for the role, Paulini spoke with nuns who had been through World War II experiences and read books on one of the film&#x27;s other characters, Sister Berenice Twohill. During one scene in the film, Paulini&#x27;s character sings a Latin requiem in Papua New Guinean dialect while standing beside a huge cross, after death has come to the mission during an aircraft attack.

In 2019, Paulini appeared as the Spider contestant on the first season of &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot;, being eliminated in finals week. In 2021, Paulini appeared as a contestant on the seventh series of &quot;I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! Australia&quot;, and was the fifth contestant to be eliminated. In 2023, Paulini was announced as one of the celebrity contestants set to compete in the twentieth series of &quot;Dancing with the Stars Australia&quot;.

=== Philanthropy ===

Throughout her career, Paulini has supported various charities in Australia. She has also performed at many fundraising events over the years, including the annual Channel Seven Perth Telethon, as well as annual Christmas carols events such as Carols in the Domain, Carols by Candlelight and Carols in the City. Paulini performed at the Olivia Newton-John and Friends Charity Gala Concert, held in September 2008 at Sydney&#x27;s State Theatre to raise funds for Newton-John&#x27;s Cancer and Wellness Centre. In 2010, she became an ambassador for The Global Good Foundation, a charity organisation campaigning against domestic violence. That same year, she was part of the Dueting It for the Kids Concert at the State Theatre, where she performed a duet with Leo Sayer. All proceeds from the concert went to The Australian Children&#x27;s Music Foundation, which &quot;provides inspiration and hope to Australia&#x27;s indigenous and disadvantaged children.&quot; Paulini performed at the launch of the 2012 Australian Firefighters Calendar and was the ambassador for the 2012 World Firefighters Games held in Sydney; money raised from both events went to the burns unit at Westmead Children&#x27;s Hospital. On 30 November 2014, Paulini headlined an annual charity event for World AIDS Day at the Brisbane gay nightclub Fluffy; all door profits from the event went to a local charity supporting local people with aids. In 2015, Paulini became an ambassador for Running Heroes, an online community for runners to help them achieve their goals. She performed at the first Barnardos Beach Bolt held at Coogee Beach on 14 June 2015, and all proceeds from the racing event went to Barnardos Australia, a child protection charity helping to stop child abuse. Paulini was a 2016 ambassador for Wellness Walk, a yearly walking event at the Sydney Harbour Bridge that &quot;raises awareness for mental illness and encourages walking as a way to improve mental wellness.&quot;

Paulini&#x27;s charity of choice for her time on I&#x27;m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here was Prostete Cancer Foundation of Australia 

== Personal life ==
Paulini was raised in a devout Christian family. She officially became an Australian citizen on 21 March 2013 at a special ceremony in Canberra that coincided with Harmony Day. Following years of struggling with her weight, Paulini showcased a new slimmer physique in 2014 after going from a size 16 to a size 10. She credits the weight loss to eating healthy, running, going to the gym, &quot;sleeping early and not staying up till late hours at night.&quot; Paulini is based in Sydney. She had been living with her sister Litia in a shared apartment in Matraville, New South Wales in 2014. Paulini&#x27;s father Isireli died on 17 September 2020 after losing his battle with prostate cancer.

Paulini is a supporter of the LGBTI community and has a gay following in Australia. Over the years, she has performed at many gay nightclubs and LGBTI-related events, including New York City Pride and the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. She told the &quot;Star Observer&quot;: &quot;the community has always been so good to me. They&#x27;re the loudest and the ones right behind me.&quot;

=== Bribery charges ===
In June 2017, Paulini was charged with &quot;corruptly giving a benefit to an agent&quot;, after she paid AU$850 to a Roads &amp; Maritime Services (RMS) employee for a fake, NSW open driver licence, despite not being qualified to drive. Paulini&#x27;s learner licence was suspended in March 2016 after she was caught driving unaccompanied and without L-plates displayed. She then spoke with an employee at a Mount Druitt RMS office in July 2016, who added an American driver licence number to Paulini&#x27;s records and issued an open NSW licence for her. The employee had already been under investigation by police for distributing fake driver licences. Paulini pleaded guilty to the offence on 4 September 2017. She already had 11 driving offences, despite having only held a learner licence since 2002. On 15 December 2017, Paulini avoided jail time and was instead given a six-month suspended sentence. She was placed on a good behaviour bond until 14 June 2018.

===Relationships===
Paulini began dating Fijian-Australian professional rugby league player Wes Naiqama in 2006. Their relationship made news headlines beginning in July 2006 when Paulini was spotted with bruises, which prompted her parents to lodge a formal complaint to Naiqama&#x27;s St George Illawarra Dragons club about the couple&#x27;s personal issues. That same month, police were called after Naiqama verbally abused Paulini outside a nightclub in Darlinghurst. Paulini and Naiqama were involved in another argument at a Double Bay restaurant in September 2006, where Naiqama was seen punching a wall. In May 2007, Paulini&#x27;s manager at the time confirmed that the couple had split. Paulini told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that despite their split, they managed to maintain a friendship, and that she vowed to keep her personal relationships in the future &quot;very, very low key&quot; out of the spotlight. Paulini&#x27;s 2009 single &quot;Scarless&quot; was written about her abusive relationship with Naiqama to help other victims who have been through domestic violence.

Between 2016 and 2017, Paulini was in a relationship with a man named Brock Hunter, whom she met at a health and fitness boot camp in Thailand. Hunter had lived on the Gold Coast, and Paulini would visit him on her days off from work. She told the &quot;Gold Coast Bulletin&quot; that Hunter was not in the sports or entertainment industry.

<text>Edinburgh Trams is a tramway in Edinburgh, Scotland, operated by Edinburgh Trams Ltd. It is an line between Newhaven and Edinburgh Airport, with 23 stops.

A modern tram network for Edinburgh was proposed by Edinburgh Council in 1999, with detailed design work being performed over the next decade. Construction of the first phase, linking Edinburgh Airport with Newhaven, began in June 2008, but encountered substantial delays and cost overruns. During 2009, a 15-year contract held by Transdev to operate and maintain the tram network was cancelled. By mid-2010, cancellation of the whole project was being publicly considered; during the following year it was announced that the length of the tram network would be drastically curtailed. Prior to August 2011, the project was overseen by Transport Initiatives Edinburgh (TIE), a company wholly owned by Edinburgh Council; TIE was disbanded largely due to its failings on the project&#x27;s delivery. The troubled construction of the Edinburgh Tram was subject to a lengthy formal inquiry, chaired by Lord Hardie, which concluded that failings by Edinburgh Council and its arms-length companies were largely to blame for the delays in construction.

On 31 May 2014, the tramway was officially opened to the public, but only between the airport and York Place. The service is operated by Edinburgh Trams Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transport for Edinburgh, in which the City of Edinburgh Council has a controlling interest. The service is equipped with 27 CAF Urbos 3 vehicles. It runs at a seven-minute interval for most of the day, seven days per week. Fares and ticketing are integrated with Lothian Buses, with the same fares charged on both systems, except for services to the airport where the tram is more expensive.

Since the original opening of the tramway, various changes have been implemented. In December 2016, the Edinburgh Gateway tram stop, between Gyle Centre and Gogarburn, was opened to provide an interchange between Edinburgh Trams and the Fife Circle Line and Edinburgh to Aberdeen Lines. Following the council&#x27;s approval for an extension of the line to Newhaven in March 2019, construction work commenced that November, and was completed on schedule in June 2023, despite being delayed for three months by the coronavirus pandemic. As of 2024, an additional extension serving the north–south axis of the city was in the planning stage.

==History==
===Background===
Edinburgh and Leith were originally served by horse-drawn coaches, and then from 1871 various companies and corporations ran trams that were horse-drawn, then cable driven and finally electric. The municipal Edinburgh Corporation Tramways ran from 1919 until 16 November 1956. After that date, public transport consisted of buses and a limited network of commuter rail lines.

Towards the end of the 20th century, there was revived interest in trams in the United Kingdom and networks were reintroduced in Birmingham, Croydon, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield. Proposals for a network in Edinburgh were made in the 1990s, and a plan to build a line along Princes Street and Leith Walk to Newhaven was proposed in 1999 by the City of Edinburgh Council, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise and the New Edinburgh Tramways Company.

===Proposals and agreement===

A 2001 proposal envisaged three routes, lines 1, 2 and 3. The first was a circular route around the northern suburbs, and the others were radial routes to Newbridge in the west and Newcraighall in the south. All lines would have passed through the city centre. In May 2004, a 15-year operating contract was awarded to Transdev, to operate and maintain the tram network. This contract was cancelled in 2009.

Two bills to reintroduce a tram network were passed by the Scottish Parliament in March 2006. Lines 1 and 2 received parliamentary permission, but funding the entire network was deemed impossible. Line 3, to be paid for by a proposed Edinburgh congestion charge, was scrapped when the charge was heavily defeated in a referendum and construction of the remaining two lines was split into four phases:

*Phase 1a from Newhaven to Edinburgh Airport via Princes Street, combining parts of lines 1 and 2
*Phase 1b from Haymarket to Granton Square via Crewe Toll, comprising most of the remainder of line 1
*Phase 2 linking Granton Square and Newhaven, completing the line 1 loop
*Phase 3 extending the airport line to Newbridge, completing line 2

The future of the scheme came under threat in 2007, when the Scottish National Party (SNP) published its manifesto for the Scottish Parliamentary election. The party made clear its intention to cancel the scheme, along with the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link, to save £1.1 billion.

Following a lost vote in the Scottish Parliament, the SNP-led minority Scottish Government agreed to continue the line from the airport to Leith on condition that no more public money would be supplied. A report by Audit Scotland, commissioned by the Scottish Government, confirmed that the cost projections were sound. The cost of the scheme in 2003 was estimated at £498million, £375million in funding from the Scottish Government and £45million from Edinburgh Council.

On 25 October 2007, the council approved the final business case. Approval was given on 22 December 2007 for TIE to sign contracts with CAF to supply vehicles and BBS (a consortium of Bilfinger Berger and Siemens) to design and construct the network. Contract negotiations finished in April 2008, and construction started in June 2008. By this stage the cost of the project was estimated at £521million. Funding problems and political disputes led to the scaling back of the original plans. In April 2009, the council cancelled phase 1b, citing revenue shortfall created by the Great Recession to save an estimated £75million. The Granton extension was also cancelled for the same purpose.

===Construction: 2007–2012===

Until August 2011, the project was overseen by Transport Initiatives Edinburgh (TIE), a company wholly owned by the City of Edinburgh Council, who were responsible for project-managing the construction of the tramway.

After the draft business case was accepted by the Scottish Government in March 2007, initial construction work commenced in July 2007, with the diversion of underground utilities in preparation for track-laying in Leith. These works followed a plan by System Design Services (SDS), a joint design team led by Parsons Brinckerhoff and Halcrow Group.

In May 2008, final contracts to build the tram system were awarded to BSC, a consortium of Bilfinger Berger, Siemens and Spanish tram builder Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF).

The tramway uses a mix of street running and segregated off-road track, with conventional tram stop platforms. Stops are fitted with shelters, ticket machines, lighting and CCTV. The network is operated from a depot in Gogar, close to the A8 roundabout, immediately west of Edinburgh Gateway tram stop.

The route of the line required the construction of bridges to cross railway lines at Edinburgh Park and Stenhouse, and a tunnel under the A8 near the Gogar roundabout. A bridge at Balgreen was widened. Works to build a tram interchange at Haymarket station involved the demolition of a Category C(S) listed building, the former Caledonian Alehouse on Haymarket Terrace.

Some on-street track was laid in a special foundation with cobbled road surfacing designed to be sympathetic with the style of Edinburgh streets but was removed in many places due to objections from cyclists. The trams are powered by overhead cables attached to purpose-built poles or mounted on the sides of buildings. Nine electrical sub-stations were planned for the line to Newhaven, both underground and above-ground but only five were built after the line was truncated at York Place.

====Revisions and delays====
In 2008 and 2009, the project met with delays to work on tramway infrastructure. Phase 1b of the project was cancelled because of a funding shortfall in April 2009. Contractual disputes delayed track-laying in the city centre. In December 2009, media reported that the project budget was running over £545million, and the system was unlikely to come into operation until February 2012 or later. The operating contract with Transdev was cancelled in December 2009 to reduce costs and it was announced that the trams would be operated by Edinburgh Trams Limited, a subsidiary of Transport for Edinburgh. During March 2010, Bilfinger Berger announced that the estimated completion date would be in 2014.

====Contractual disputes====
In February 2009, work on the Princes Street section stopped due to contractual disagreements between TIE and BSC after the latter submitted a request for an additional £80million of funding. Edinburgh Council believed the contractors&#x27; claims were unjustified as they had agreed to fixed-price contracts. After negotiations, BSC agreed to commence construction in March 2009 within the original budget, although disagreements remained. Work restarted and line construction went ahead.

In August 2009, TIE began legal proceedings against the BSC consortium over delays to the project, and track-laying on Leith Walk, Shandwick Place and Haymarket was suspended. At issue were alleged changes to BSC&#x27;s work specification, including track works on Princes Street and £5million additional costs for foundation work near Murrayfield Stadium. The BSC consortium alleged that TIE had not diverted the underground utilities in time for track-laying to begin, breaching contractual agreements and costing the consortium additional staffing expenditure.

In January 2010, the independent arbiter found in favour of TIE on some points, but on most of the disputed issues ruled in favour of BSC and awarded the consortium 90% of its additional costs, estimated to be up to £80million.

Delays in track laying and depot construction affected vehicle testing. By September 2009, construction was reported to be nine months behind schedule, and CAF was due to deliver the first trams from its factory in Spain. With key project dependency out of synchronisation, TIE held discussions with Transport for London about delivering the trams to Croydon to conduct operational tests on the Tramlink network. Tram vehicle testing commenced in March 2010 on the Siemens test track in Wildenrath, Germany. The tests included recreating the steep gradients of Leith Walk, and using weights to simulate the heavy passenger load expected during a Murrayfield match day.

====Funding crisis====

Following further disputes and delays, it was reported in March 2010 that Edinburgh Council was considering cancelling the contract with Bilfinger Berger. By June 2010, the project&#x27;s cost had risen to £600million. Council project managers were reported to be in crisis talks, considering options including: borrowing £55million to fund the increased costs; phasing the introduction of the tram line, so that trams would initially run between the airport and Haymarket; and terminating the contract with Bilfinger Berger. The council asked TIE to draw up costs for truncating the line at four places: Haymarket station, York Place, the foot of Leith Walk or Ocean Terminal.

Work resumed in May 2011 at priority locations, Haymarket Yards and Gogar, while the project&#x27;s future was decided by the council. In August 2011 it was announced TIE would be disbanded and consultants Turner &amp; Townsend would manage the project.

On 30 June 2011, Edinburgh Council voted to continue the line between Edinburgh Airport and St Andrew Square. Costs rose to an estimated £770million, leaving the council with a shortfall of more than £200million. The option to scrap the project was considered, but rejected. On 25 August 2011, the council voted to cut the line to run between the airport and Haymarket, reducing the expected cost to £715million. A week later, after the Scottish Government threatened to withhold £72million of funding, the council reversed its decision, restoring the terminus at St Andrew Square. On 29 November 2011, it was announced that the eastern terminus would be at York Place instead of St Andrew Square; the intention had been to build the tracks to a reversing point at York Place (without a stop for passengers). Extending passenger services from St Andrew Square to York Place would enable Broughton Street, Picardy Place and the surrounding area to be better served at comparatively little additional cost.

The first electric wires were energised in October 2011 within the depot at Gogar. Testing trams began in December 2011 near the depot at Gogar, on a length of track. On 15 December 2011, the contractors handed the depot to the City of Edinburgh Council. The first completed section of line, between the depot and Edinburgh Airport, was used to test a tram at full speed on 19 December 2012.

With extra interest payments factored in, the cost of the line was expected to exceed £1billion despite the decreased scope of the network.

====Criticism====

Delays in construction were criticised by businesses, who claimed their income was damaged by long-term road closures in the centre of the city, and also by some residents.

Cycling groups voiced safety concerns after people were injured as their bicycle wheels became caught in the track. They reported the road surface around the tracks was crumbling, raising further safety problems. In response, TiE promised to carry out repairs and Edinburgh Trams agreed to fund special training for cyclists. During 2017, a woman was crushed to death by a passing bus when her bicycle wheel was caught in the tracks. Further safety concerns were raised by residents along the routes about the suspension of overhead electric cables from residential buildings, and some property owners refused permission for cables to be attached.

To remedy crumbling tarmac along the tracks on Princes Street, the road was closed in September 2011 and remained closed for ten months. A road closure between Haymarket and Shandwick Place in March 2012 led to complaints from businesses and residents. It remained closed until October 2013. Originally to open as &quot;Shandwick Place&quot; tram stop, it was renamed &quot;West End - Princes Street&quot; prior to opening at the request of local traders, who felt the new name had greater associations to the city centre and would encourage more tourists to get off there. The stop was renamed again in August 2019 as &quot;West End&quot;.

===Completion: 2013–2014===
From late 2012, work continued mostly on schedule. More than of flawed concrete trackbed had to be replaced between Shandwick Place and Haymarket. In June 2013, overhead electric wires were installed on the city centre portion of the route. This was considered the last major step in the construction process.

Originally, it was planned that concessionary travel, that is the ability of those with a Scottish National Entitlement Card to travel on public transport free of charge, was not going to be offered on the tramway. This was despite the fact that Edinburgh Trams is to be run by Lothian Buses, who are mandated to offer free travel to those with concession cards on all their bus routes. This revelation quickly caused city leaders to support an &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; campaign to ensure that concessionary travel would be offered on the new tramway. City transport convener Lesley Hinds stated &quot;People in Edinburgh have paid through their council tax and their taxes for the trams to get up and running and it would be wrong for a large proportion of the population not to be allowed to use their concessionary bus pass&quot;.

Despite this, the Scottish Government refused to pay for concessionary travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but that they should be paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.

Works were two months ahead of schedule by September 2013, when Edinburgh Council announced the tramway would open by May 2014. All tram and road works were completed by 19 October with testing of the trams between the depot and Edinburgh Park commencing on 8 October 2013. This was followed by the energising of tram wires from Bankhead tram stop to York Place on 19 November, marking the first time that the route was completely energised. Testing along the full length of the route began on 5 December.

The tramway opened to passengers on 31 May 2014.

===Public inquiry===

In June 2014, shortly after the opening of the line, the then First Minister Alex Salmond announced a non-statutory public inquiry into the project&#x27;s delays and cost overruns. The inquiry, which was headed by the former Lord Advocate, Andrew Hardie, Baron Hardie, was later upgraded to a statutory inquiry to ensure that key personnel would provide evidence.

The inquiry was itself subject to considerable delays. It finally published its report in August 2023. The report concluded that failings by Edinburgh Council, its arms-length companies and the Scottish Government were to blame for the delays, with much of the criticism being directed against TIE. Lord Hardie made 24 recommendations in the report, and also provided a figure of £835.7m for the final cost of the project.

===Extension from city centre to Newhaven===

Edinburgh Council stated on 17 March 2014 that works would be conducted along Leith Walk to prepare it for a possible future extension of tram service. In December 2014, Edinburgh Council ordered a detailed business case for extending the line to Leith. The council said in July 2015 that three options for an extension to Leith had been costed. These were a £144.7million extension to Newhaven, a £126.6million extension to Ocean Terminal, or a £78.7million extension to the Foot of Leith Walk.

During 2017, the business case to extend the system to Newhaven was approved.

In June 2018, Colin Beattie, the MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, and others, suggested that the system should be extended to Musselburgh to relieve traffic congestion on the approaches to the City Bypass.

In March 2019, Edinburgh Council approved extending the system from York Place to Newhaven, with the line due to be operational by early 2023. Preliminary works to Constitution Street and Leith Walk started in November 2019. Work was suspended in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic but was restarted in June 2020.

In February 2022, the eastern terminating York Place stop was permanently closed for demolition and to enable connection to the Newhaven extension which relocated the York Place stop to Picardy Place. Services initially terminated at the West End stop between February and April 2022, and then the St Andrew Square stop before June 2023; however, trams still ran to York Place to turn back.

On 13 March 2023, following completion of tracklaying and the installation of overhead power lines, test trams began running during the night between Picardy Place and Newhaven, becoming the first tram to run in Leith since the closure of the original tramway system. The first test trams ran at walking pace, but their speed was later increased to . Daytime testing commenced on 19 April 2023, with 40 newly recruited drivers under training. After an announcement on 25 May 2023, revenue service on the full route began on 7 June 2023.

In June 2024, the Trams to Newhaven project won an award from the Local Government Chronicle in its Future Places category, with the citation praising &quot;[t]he deep collaboration between the council and private sector partners&quot;.

=== Further north to south extension ===

During the early 2020s, plans were being prepared for a new line which would connect Granton in the north of the city with the Bioquarter in the south east, and possibly further onto either Dalkeith or Queen Margaret University or Shawfair. At a meeting on 1 February 2024, City of Edinburgh Council voted to put the proposed north–south extension to public consultation; by this point, it had an estimated construction cost of £2bn.

==Annual patronage==
==Current line==
===Route===

The single, route begins running on-street at Newhaven, and then, via an 8 stop extension which opened in June 2023, from the port of Leith to York Place (now served by Picardy Place) in the city centre. It turns into North St Andrew Street, crosses St Andrew Square. From the square, it heads southeast into Princes Street, and west along the street toward Haymarket, via Shandwick Place, Atholl Place and West Maitland Street. At Haymarket, the route heads onto a segregated track parallel to the Glasgow to Edinburgh mainline. It follows the railway line west for about , to Edinburgh Park railway station. There, it leaves the railway line on a segregated track and heads north to Gogar Roundabout from where it heads northwest via Ingliston Park and Ride to Edinburgh Airport, where it terminates.

An additional tram stop was opened in December 2016, between Gyle Centre and Gogarburn. This stop, called Edinburgh Gateway, is situated alongside the Edinburgh Gateway railway station which opened at the same time. The station provides an interchange between Edinburgh Trams and the Fife Circle Line and Edinburgh to Aberdeen Lines. After this stop opened, crews changed here rather than at the special short platform which had been constructed alongside the nearby Gogar depot. Thus, the additional stop at Edinburgh Gateway did not affect the end-to-end running time between the Airport and York Place.

===Stops===

===Former stops===

===Frequencies and journey times===
Approximate journey times from the airport are ten minutes to Gyle Centre, 30 minutes to the city centre (Princes Street) and 55 minutes to Newhaven. The journey from the city centre to Newhaven takes approximately 25 minutes.

Services run every seven to ten minutes. , the first service of the day leaves Gyle Centre for Newhaven at 04:26. The first service leaves Newhaven at 05:20 and the airport at 06:26. The last service of the day leaves the airport at 22:48 and Newhaven at 23:50. The timetable is broadly the same every day of the week, except for a slightly reduced early morning frequency on Saturdays and Sundays.

As the first scheduled flight leaves Edinburgh at approximately 06:00, it is not currently possible to use the tram to get to the airport in time for security and departure. Conversely it is also not possible to use the tram on later arriving flights at Edinburgh Airport.

There are often later services on Friday and Saturday nights during the Edinburgh Festival and Fringe. The service interval is often reduced to three minutes before and after major events at Murrayfield Stadium.

==Rolling stock==
===Current fleet===
Edinburgh Trams currently operates a fleet of 27 trams, as follows:

====CAF Urbos 3====

A £40million contract to build 27 Urbos 3 trams, sufficient for phase 1a and (unbuilt) 1b lines, was awarded to CAF. When the line was cut back to York Place, only 17 trams would be needed. An unsuccessful attempt was made in 2011 to lease ten trams to Transport for London for use on Tramlink.

The trams are bi-directional, long and with low-floor access to meet UK Rail Vehicle Access Regulations for disabled people.

In April 2010, the first tram was delivered and displayed at the Princes Street stop at the bottom of The Mound, before being moved to open storage in Broxburn. The 27th tram was delivered in December 2012. 
The trams have wrapped advertisements for promoting local events and commercial advertising.

==Fares and ticketing==

===Fare structure===
Ticketing and fares are integrated with Lothian Buses. A proof of payment system applies. The single fare within the city zone is the same as on Lothian Buses (£2, with effect from 1 April 2023); day tickets and Ridacards are equally valid on trams and buses. As an exception, the tram fare from the city zone to the airport is £7.50 one-way compared to £5.50 for the bus.

The &quot;Ridacard&quot; is a smartcard season ticket issued by Transport for Edinburgh; it is valid on both Edinburgh Trams and Lothian Buses (available for one week, four weeks or annually). On 1 September 2014, a rechargeable pre-paid smartcard for single journeys on both buses and trams, called &quot;Citysmart&quot;, was introduced.

Free travel is available to holders of City of Edinburgh Council-issued Scottish National Entitlement Cards which are eligible for concessionary travel, and for a companion travelling with the cardholder of National Entitlement Cards with a companion entitlement. Passengers with National Entitlement Cards eligible for concessionary travel but issued by other local authorities are not offered any fare concession, with the exception of blind or visually impaired cardholders. This is due to the free travel for local residents being funded by the City Council rather than the government.

An &quot;onboard fare&quot; of £10 is charged to passengers who have not pre-purchased a ticket or validated either a Ridacard, a National Entitlement Card or an m-ticket before boarding.

===Ticket machines===

At the request of Lothian Buses, installation of 30ticket machines at key bus stops began in 2007. Passengers had to purchase tickets before boarding the bus, reducing dwell times, but the machines were not popular with users and were scrapped in 2011. Consideration was given to installing similar on-street ticket machines, and new, advanced machines (capable of reading smartcards and accepting credit/debit cards) were installed in early 2014 at each tram stop. The new ticket machines are the Galexio-Plus type supplied by Flowbird Transport Ltd. Ticket machines do not accept banknotes or give change. The minimum spend for a card transaction was originally £3 which was more than the cost for a single ticket. The minimum spend was scrapped in September 2019, following complaints from customers and negative press comments.

==Services==
Services run every seven minutes throughout the entire line, between St Andrew Square and Edinburgh Airport. On 7 June 2023, the services extended north from St Andrew Square to Newhaven, connecting Leith more quickly than bus services from the city centre, for the first time in almost 70years.

===Bicycle policy===
In May and June 2015, cyclists were allowed to board the trams with their bikes, during a trial period which was supported by cycle campaign groups Spokes and Pedal on Parliament. Following this, Edinburgh trams became the first modern tram network in the UK to permit the carriage of bikes on a permanent basis, with up to two bicycles being allowed per tram outwith peak hours (7.30am to 9.30am, and 4pm to 6.30pm) and excluding the period of the Edinburgh Festival and the Festival Fringe (usually 3½ weeks during August) and other large events.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership and structure===
Edinburgh Trams Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary company of Transport for Edinburgh Limited. By virtue of its controlling interest in the parent&#x27;s equity capital, the City of Edinburgh Council is the ultimate controlling party.

===Business trends===
The key trends for Edinburgh Trams Limited since it commenced operations in May 2014 are (years ending 31 December):
Edinburgh Trams made a pre-tax profit of £252,000 for 2016, against a predicted loss of £170,000, which meant that profitability had been achieved two years ahead of schedule. This was based on excluding maintenance and infrastructure costs. Including these, as has been done since 2018 when these costs were shifted to Edinburgh Trams, the small operating profit (£3million) has turned to a large operating loss (e.g. £9.4million in 2018). It has not achieved an operating profit since full costing.

===Staffing===
Fifty-two ticket inspectors have been recruited to prevent fare dodging. Edinburgh Council is aiming for a 3% fare evasion rate, lower than any other tramway in Britain. Thirty-two drivers were employed, after passing psychological tests designed to eliminate risk-takers.

==Accidents and incidents==
Frequent accidents involving cyclists and the tramway have been reported since the opening of the system in 2014. These are typically caused by bicycle wheels getting stuck in the rails or by bikes skidding on the rails. A study published in 2018 found that, up to April 2016, 191 cyclists in Edinburgh had suffered tramway-related accidents serious enough to require hospital treatment. In September 2022, using Freedom of Information (FoI) data, the BBC reported that there had been 422accidents involving cyclists on the tram tracks, as a result of which 196 cyclists had made successful claims against Edinburgh City Council, resulting in nearly £1.3million being paid in damages.
Following a further FoI request in September 2024, it was reported there had been 112 collisions between trams and other road vehicles since 2014, as well as four collisions involving cyclists (not including incidents involving cyclists and trams tracks).

Noteworthy accidents include:
* On 29 August 2014, a bus and tram collided in the West End of Edinburgh, causing severe traffic congestion.
* On 31 May 2017, a medical student was killed in Princes Street when she fell into the path of a minibus after her bike wheels may have become stuck in the tram rails. However, the exact cause of her fall is not known.
* On 13 June 2018, a bus and tram collided near Edinburgh Airport, seriously injuring the bus driver.
* On 11 September 2018, a pedestrian was killed by a tram on a crossing near Saughton tram stop. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch determined that the tram&#x27;s warning bell was not loud enough, and that Edinburgh Trams should better monitor risks at crossings. The tram company was subsequently fined £240,000 for breaches of health and safety regulations. In April 2024, it was announced that a fatal accident inquiry into the incident would take place at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.

<text>In materials science, fragile matter is a granular material that is jammed solid. Everyday examples include beans getting stuck in a hopper in a whole food shop, or milk powder getting jammed in an upside-down bottle. The term was coined by physicist Michael Cates, who asserts that such circumstances warrant a new class of materials. The jamming thus described can be unjammed by mechanical means, such as tapping or shaking the container, or poking it with a stick.

Cates proposed that such jammed systems differ from ordinary solids in that if the direction of the applied stress changes, the jam will break up. Sometimes the change of direction required is very small.

Perhaps the simplest example is a pile of sand, which is solid in the sense that the pile sustains its shape despite the force of gravity. Slight tilting or vibration is enough to enable the grains to shift, collapsing the pile.

Not all jammed systems are fragile, i.e. foam. Shaving foam is jammed because the bubbles are tightly packed together under the isotropic stress imposed by atmospheric pressure. If it were a fragile solid, it would respond plastically to shear stress, however small. But because bubbles deform, foam actually responds elastically provided that the stress is below a threshold value. Fragile matter is also not to be confused with cases in which the particles have adhered to one another (&quot;caking&quot;).

<text>The Mills Blue Rhythm Band was an American big band active during the 1930s.

== History ==
The band was formed in New York City in 1930 by drummer Willie Lynch as the Blue Rhythm Band, and then briefly operated as the Coconut Grove Orchestra. Irving Mills became its manager in 1931 and it subsequently assumed the name Mills Blue Rhythm Band. Compere Jimmy Ferguson (Baron Lee) replaced Lynch. Another brief leader, reeds player Bingie Madison, left at the time of the final name change. Over its lifetime, the group was known as the &quot;Blue Rhythm Band&quot;, &quot;Blue Ribbon Band&quot;, &quot;Blue Rhythm Boys&quot;, &quot;The Blue Racketeers&quot;, &quot;Earl Jackson&#x27;s Musical Champions&quot;, &quot;Earl Jackson and his Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Duke Wilson and his Ten Blackberries&quot;, &quot;King Carter&#x27;s Royal Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Mills Music Masters&quot;, &quot;Harlem Hot Shots&quot;. It accompanied Louis Armstrong on some record sides.

The Mills Blue Rhythm Band were based at The Cotton Club in Harlem. They worked steadily through the 1930s deputizing for the orchestra of Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, often taking their undesirable engagements. Mills managed Ellington and Calloway as well. Edgar Hayes, Eddie Mallory and Dave Nelson all had temporary stints as band leader, until Lucky Millinder permanently took over the role in 1934.

The band recorded 150 sides for labels including Brunswick, Columbia, Victor, the ARC stable of labels (including Oriole, Perfect, Regal, Romeo, Banner, Melotone, Domino), Variety, and Vocalion. Although a few of their records became hits (including &quot;Truckin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Ride, Red, Ride&quot;) and the MBRB had a lineup of talented soloists, the group never attained the prominence of their peers. This has been attributed to the lack of a single identifiable leader, and Irving Mills&#x27; preference to have the band perform an understudy role.

By 1937, the group was billed as Lucky Millinder and his Orchestra and disbanded in 1938. Millinder joined Bill Doggett&#x27;s band before reforming it into his own orchestra in 1940.

Irving Mills revived the Mills Blue Rhythm Band name for two recording sessions in 1947, under the guidance of Van Alexander. The only original band member performing at either of the 1947 sessions was trumpeter Charlie Shavers.

<text>Wilbur Daigh Mills (May 24, 1909 – May 2, 1992) was an American Democratic politician and lawyer who represented in the United States House of Representatives from 1939 until his retirement in 1977. As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1958 to 1974, he was often called &quot;the most powerful man in Washington&quot;.

Born in Kensett, Arkansas, Mills began a legal career after attending Harvard Law School. He served as the youngest ever county judge of his native White County, Arkansas, then won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1938, the youngest elected from Arkansas. As the youngest chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mills was the Congressional architect in establishing Medicare. He was also the architect of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, lowering rates on the poor, raising rates on the rich, and creating the alternative minimum tax, as well as a strong advocate for infrastructure projects, especially the Interstate Highway System. Mills&#x27; name was entered in a few states in the 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries, championing an automatic cost of living adjustment to Social Security, to mixed electoral results in the primaries.

After two public incidents with a stripper named Fanne Foxe, Mills stepped down as Chair of the Ways and Means and checked into the Palm Beach Institute for Alcoholism for three months and he declined to seek re-election in 1976, even though he had received more than 59% of the vote for re-election after the first incident. After leaving office, he returned to the practice of law and helped establish a center for the treatment of alcoholism, the Wilbur D. Mills Center for Alcoholism and Drug Treatment Center, while supporting similar centers around the country in their fundraising efforts.

==Youth and early political life==

Mills was born in Kensett, Arkansas, to Abbie Lois Daigh Mills and Ardra Pickens Mills. Kensett was the first public school in Arkansas to integrate under Mills&#x27;s father, who was first superintendent, then chairman of the school board, and the banker for the school district. Mills attended public schools in Kensett but graduated as valedictorian from Searcy High School in Searcy, the county seat of White County. He thereafter graduated from Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, as salutatorian, having resided in Martin Hall. He studied constitutional law at Harvard Law School under Felix Frankfurter, who later was nominated and confirmed (1939) as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. Mills returned to Arkansas to run his father&#x27;s bank and assist with the store during the Great Depression and was soon admitted to the Arkansas Bar Association in 1933.

Mills served as the 29th county judge of White County between 1935 and 1939, and began small Medicare-like, county-funded program, with a $5,000 fund to pay medical bills (), prescription drugs which were sold at cost, and hospital treatment for the indigent which were lowered to $2.50 per day (), as well as have doctors see qualified patients free of charge. Patients were qualified for the program through petitioning the local justice of the peace, who in turn made a recommendation to Mills as county judge.

==In Congress==

===House Ways and Means Committee===
Mills served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1939 to 1977, including 17 years (1958–1974) as chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, a post he held longer than any other person in U.S. history. Mills was often termed &quot;the most powerful man in Washington&quot; during his tenure. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto opposing the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. However, Mills was never a segregationist personally: always a strong advocate for inclusion, his longest and closest aide was Walter Little, a black man from North Carolina. Mills told House Speaker Sam Rayburn that he was not going to sign the Manifesto, to which Rayburn responded by advising him that he would be defeated for re-election if he did not sign, so Mills ultimately did.

Mills&#x27;s accomplishments in Congress included playing a large role in creating the Highway Trust Fund, opening up economic development through commerce between rivers and railroads, and then first creating the Kerr-Mills Health Insurance legislation, and then being the Congressional architect of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Mills initially had reservations about the program because he was worried about the eventual cost, especially since the early proposals by the President and some Members of Congress proposed funding Medicare from the Social Security Trust Fund. Mills expected correctly that health care costs would continue to rise dramatically over time and, thus, would bankrupt Social Security. He saw Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid as programs that people need to rely on and it would be economically, psychologically, and politically devastating to terminate. Mills was also acknowledged as the primary tax expert in Congress and the leading architect of the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Mills favored a conservative fiscal approach, adequate tax revenue to fund government programs, a balanced budget, while also supporting various social programs, especially Social Security and Disability, adding farmers and public employees to Social Security, unemployment compensation, and national health insurance.

In 1967, when President Lyndon B. Johnson required funds to support the cost of escalating the Vietnam War, Mills refused to support Johnson&#x27;s proposed surtax and demanded that any tax increases be matched by equivalent cuts in federal spending. Johnson accepted his challenge and balanced the federal budget during his last fiscal year as president. Mills congratulated him, as he had actually cut more spending even than Mills had demanded. Mills and Johnson often laughed about Mills forcing a big spender to become the first president in decades to not only balance the budget but to start paying down the national debt. As the next (and most recent) president to balance the budget was Bill Clinton, some Arkansans have bragged, &quot;It takes an Arkansan to balance the federal budget and to pay down the federal debt.

===Presidential candidate===

Mills was drafted by friends and fellow Congressmen to make himself available as a candidate for president of the United States in 1972 in a few of the Democratic primaries. He was not strong in the primaries and won 33 votes for president from the delegates at the 1972 Democratic National Convention, which nominated Senator George McGovern. His name was mentioned as a possible Treasury Secretary in a McGovern administration.

==Scandal, alcoholism, recovery and retirement==
Mills was involved in a traffic incident in Washington, D.C. at 2a.m. on October 7, 1974. U.S. Park Police stopped his car late at night because his driver had not activated the vehicle&#x27;s headlights. Mills was intoxicated, and his face was injured following a scuffle with Annabelle Battistella, better known as Fanne Foxe, a stripper from Argentina. When police approached the car, Foxe leapt from the vehicle and jumped into the nearby Tidal Basin. She was taken to St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Mental Hospital for treatment. The Park Police took Mills to his home. Despite the scandal, Mills was re-elected in November 1974 in a heavily Democratic year with nearly 60% of the vote, defeating Republican Judy Petty. On November 30, 1974, Mills, seemingly drunk, was accompanied by Eduardo Battestella, Fanne Foxe&#x27;s husband, onstage at The Pilgrim Theatre in Boston, where Foxe was performing. He held a press conference from Foxe&#x27;s dressing room. Mills stepped down from his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged his alcoholism, joined Alcoholics Anonymous, and checked himself into the Palm Beach Institute in West Palm Beach, Florida for two months, where he was joined in treatment by Mrs. Mills. Mills chose not to run for re-election in 1976, and to continue to devote himself to his recovery and his work with other alcoholics in public office. He was succeeded by a family friend, Democrat Jim Guy Tucker. Thereafter, Mills practiced tax law at the prestigious Shea and Gould Law Firm of New York&#x27;s Washington Office, until he retired in 1991 and moved back to Arkansas to work on the continued development including a new campus of the Wilbur D. Mills Treatment Center for Alcoholism, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences&#x27;s Wilbur D. Mills Endowed Chairs on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, and the Masonic Grand Lodge&#x27;s capital fundraising campaign.

Mills died in Searcy, Arkansas in 1992. He is interred at Kensett Cemetery in Kensett, Arkansas.

==Personal life==
Wilbur was married to Clarine &quot;Polly&quot; Billingsley Mills for almost 58 years from 1934 until his death in 1992; she died on October 16, 2001. They are interred side by side at the Kensett Cemetery.

<text>The Volkswagen LT is the largest light commercial panel van produced by Volkswagen (and subsequently Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles as of 1996) from 1975 to 2006, before being replaced by the Crafter. Two generations were produced.

==1st generation LT (&quot;Typ&quot; 28/&quot;Typ&quot; 21)==
===History===
Volkswagen introduced the Volkswagen Type 2 in 1950 and developed light commercial vehicle versions for German and European markets. The name &quot;Kombi&quot; (the name under which the Type 2 was sold in Brazil) established itself as a concept term to describe an entire light commercial vehicle segment. The automaker introduced the revised Volkswagen Type 2 (T2) in 1967. Commercial customers were shipping heavier and larger-volume freight. The Volkswagen Type 2 platform was also limited by its rear-mounted engine design. A total of 471,221 series 1 LTs were produced between 1975 and 1996.

===Design===

The new design specifications for a larger transporter as an additional series ranged from 2.8 tons gross vehicle weight to 3.5 tons. The layout was a conventional rear drive with the engine located above the front axle, in a forward control or &#x27;cab over&#x27; design.

The new Volkswagen van was launched in 1975 in Berlin. The name given to Volkswagen&#x27;s large transporter was as functional as the entire vehicle: it was just called LT, which is simply the abbreviation of &quot;Lasten-Transporter&quot; (that basically means &quot;heavy load transporter&quot; or &quot;cargo transporter&quot;).

The LT came in three gross vehicle weights, from 2.8 to 3.5 tons (LT 28, LT 31, LT 35), with two wheelbases, two roof options, and with bodywork options as a panel van, a compact, a platform vehicle, and a chassis cab combination.

The design featured a high ratio of utility space to footprint due to its forward control design and overall width of . The compact LT panel van (with a little over four and a half metres in length) offered an interior load length of over three metres and a load area of around 5.5 square metres.

===Suspension/Axles===
The LT was equipped with a front axle with independent front wheel suspension. Later options, such as the heavy LT 40 to LT 55, had a solid front axle to achieve increased load-carrying capacity as is common for light trucks.

===Facelifts===
The first facelift in 1983 changed mostly the interior, at the same time as the engine cover was changed and the turbo-diesel and inline-6 petrol engines were introduced. A redesigned dashboard was added and various other small things were changed. The undercarriage had an additional third wheelbase as an option for platform-type vehicles, at up to 4.6 metres in length.

Two years later, Volkswagen again increased the gross vehicle weight, with the 5.6 ton LT 55. It was available with a single-tyre rear axle, allowing for more space between rear wheel wells inside the cargo floor. An LT with four-wheel drive that could be enabled from within the cab was also available.

The next facelift in 1986 changed the round headlights to rectangular units, as well as other minor cosmetic retouches.

In Spring 1993, there was again a modest change in the look, with new grey-plastic elements introduced to the radiator grille and in the rear lighting section. The diesel engines were replaced with a more modern version of the same block. The DW (N/A diesel) was replaced by the ACT engine and the DV (turbo-diesel) engines were replaced by the intercooled ACL engine. Additionally, the engine cover was replaced with a new version, that had an opening in the front allowing to check the coolant without having to open the entire engine cover.

===Campervan versions===


A touring camper in its various bodywork and fitting options was also produced. The vehicle&#x27;s width allowed the possibility of beds arranged crosswise. Various Volkswagen-endorsed Westfalia campervan models were available for the LT, including the &quot;Sven Hedin&quot;, and a later model, &quot;Florida&quot;. The LT was also used by Karmann who produced over 3,000 Karmann LT Distance Wide coachbuilt motorhomes.

===Truck cabs===
The &quot;G Series&quot; light truck was a joint venture between Volkswagen and MAN AG, with gross vehicle weights of between six and ten tons. It was built from 1979 until 1993.

Volkswagen&#x27;s Brazilian plant at Resende has been constructing trucks with weights of between 7 and 35 tons. Even after the launch of the new Volkswagen Constellation in 2006, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles has continued to manufacture vehicles incorporating cabs based on the first generation of the LT, such as the Worker and Delivery trucks.

===Rebadging===
In the late eighties, German-built Volkswagen LT and MAN-VW G were sold in Spain as Pegaso Ekus, while Brazilian-built units were marketed in the US as Peterbilt Midrangers.

===4x4===
A 4X4 version of the LT was also produced. Volkswagen had already prepared for this in 1983 with the cab facelift, which incorporated instrumentation lights for the front, centre, and rear differential locks.

Sülzer developed a 6-cylinder, primarily diesel-powered, 4x4 version of the long-wheelbase VW LT, of which 156 were built. These were either LT40 or LT45 (rated 4 or 4.5 tonne). Opposed to the normal LT40 &amp; LT45, the 4x4s only had single wheels on the rear axle. The chassis is lifted, 26mm anti-roll bars are added to cope with body-roll and the axles are replaced. A propshaft driven, rod/shaft controlled transfer box was installed under the vehicle.

The transfer box was a New Process 208, which is propshaft-driven and cable-operated. The same transfer box can also be found in Chevrolet Blazers and Jeep Cherokees of around the same time. The first six of the Sülzer vehicles are supposed to have had Dana 70 axles. After that production was changed to use the Italian-built Clark-Hurth axles. All 4x4 LTs came as standard with rear and centre locking differentials, with optional front diff-lock also available (until it became standard fitment in 1991).

Due to the change of axles, the 4x4 LTs came with different wheels to the standard LTs. All 4x4 LTs have 6 stud tube type split-rims in 6.5J width. The standard tyre fitment on these wheels is 7.00x16 or 7.50x16.

In 1985 VW took over the production of the 4x4 LT and introduced the DW (2.4 inline-6 N/A diesel) and DV (2.4 inline-6 turbo-diesel) engines to the portfolio. They made another 1250 or so 4x4 LTs. The model portfolio covered only long-wheelbase vehicles. Tintop and hightop as LT40, pickup and double-cab as LT40 or LT45.

In 1991 the naturally aspirated diesel engine was dropped from the 4x4 program as it did not have enough power for the 4x4 drivetrain, with most 4x4 LTs being either the 90 bhp 6-cyl petrol or the 102 bhp 6-cyl D24T. From 1993 on, VW introduced the D24TIC with 95 bhp, but more torque, for the LT (and LT 4x4). At the same time the transfer box was upgraded to the New Process 241.

Steyr-Puch in Austria built the Noriker using VW LT underpinnings in competition with the Sülzer and VW LT 4x4s, but they only were produced in limited numbers.

De Vries also built three VW LT 4x4s on the same principle as Sülzer/VW, one of which was used in the Dakar Rally in 1983.

Out of 5 million Mk1 VW LTs built, only 1,250 featured four-wheel drive.

===&quot;Typ&quot; codes===
The Volkswagen &quot;&quot;Typ&quot; codes&quot; for the first generation LT were:
* &quot;Typ&quot; 28 — April 1975 to July 1991
* &quot;Typ&quot; 21 — August 1991 to December 1995
* &quot;Typ&quot; 29 — 4x4 1984 to 1989
The last first-generation LT was produced in 1996, which corresponds to a British &#x27;P&#x27; registration plate. In 21 years, just under 500,000 vehicles were assembled.

===Engines===
The petrol engine was a modified Audi 100 VW EA831 2.0 L inline four-cylinder. In 1976 Volkswagen wanted to make a sports coupe and had Porsche design one for them using parts from the VW/Audi group bin with front engine and rear-wheel drive. They did not go with the design as the rest of the range was switching to front-wheel drive i.e. Golf/Polo/Jetta so VW came up with another design (the Scirocco). Porsche then decided to build it anyway in a collaboration with VW culminating in the Porsche 924 running with an VW EA831 Audi 2 L engine with Bosch K-Jetronic injection which is the same basic engine that was in the 2 L petrol LT at the time albeit with a carburetor and a vastly uprated Porsche designed cylinder head. It was rated at 55 kilowatts (75 PS; 74 bhp) and achieved higher torque at lower engine RPMs.

An inline four-cylinder diesel engine by Perkins was available. The 48 kilowatts (65 PS; 64 bhp) 2.7 L diesel was included in the LT range from 1976 onwards.

The Perkins engine was replaced in 1978 with a six-cylinder variant of the Volkswagen Golf diesel. The original 1.6 L four-cylinder engine became the D24 2.4 L six-cylinder, delivering . This engine was also used in a number of Volvo passenger cars.

In December 1982, an upgrade to the LT was introduced. The six-cylinder diesel was available as a turbodiesel, the Volkswagen D24T engine, producing and of torque. In addition, the six-cylinder engine was now also available as a petrol engine. All engines were now mounted with a clear offset alignment that allowed for a flatter engine compartment, which was shifted further to the rear for more space for a third seat in the cab.

In 1992, an overhauled turbo-diesel engine with charge air cooler and was introduced – the Volkswagen D24TIC engine.

Early DV/ACL engine valves are mechanically shimmed; later versions were hydraulically auto-adjusted. The ACL had bigger injectors and the addition of the intercooler. The main block and bottom end remained identical. The head/valve adjusters/injectors/intake manifold and the turbo had variants plus a different sump for the oil to be pumped to the turbo.

===Axles===
Turbodiesel axles are reinforced, have the transition to the cardan shaft further ahead, or a shorter shaft.
Axles for single tires cannot be installed in vehicles with twin tires and vice versa.
LT 1 4x4 axles are completely different and cannot be replaced by other LT axles.

A full list of code letter explanations is available on the German VW LT wiki.

==2nd generation LT (&quot;Typ&quot; 2D)==

===History===
In 1996, the joint venture of Volkswagen and Daimler&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz Commercial introduced the second generation LT. The Volkswagen version shared the body shell with the new Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. However, the engine and transmission were Volkswagen Group sourced. This deal would continue in the Volkswagen Crafter, a successor to the LT.

The new design incorporated an engine mounted longitudinally beneath a short hood and with rear-wheel drive. The LT adopted what had become the standard style of construction for bigger transporters. It also included economical direct-injection diesel engines, easy access to the driver cab behind the front axle, and a wide space between the driver and passenger seat.

The range now went from 2.6 to 4.6 tons gross vehicle weight, and the enclosed options of the panel van and compact were available in three wheelbase options. Platform vehicles, crew cabs, and numerous undercarriage options completed the range. A special articulated version of the second generation LT, the XLT was available through special order.

===&quot;Typ&quot; codes===
The Volkswagen &quot;&quot;Typ&quot; codes&quot; for the second generation LT are:
* &quot;Typ&quot; 35 — May 1996 to July 2006

===Engines===
Engines included a naturally aspirated engine, as well as three Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engines. These were the inline-five-cylinder TDI used in the Volkswagen Eurovan (Type 2 T4). The performance range for the LT initially went from . In January 2002, an inline-four-cylinder 2.8 L engine made by MWM International Motores increased power output to , and the maximum torque to .

The 2.8 L engine specifications:
* inline-four-cylinder, 93 mm bore, 103 mm stroke and three valves per cylinder
* rated output: EEC at 3500 rpm; at 1800 rpm
* Diesel common rail fuel system

The 2.5 L:
* inline-five-cylinder, 81 mm bore, 95.5 mm stroke, 19.5 compression ratio, and two valves per cylinder
* rated output: EEC at 3500 rpm; at 1900 rpm
* Diesel direct injection fuel system (Bosch VP37 belt-driven pump with two-stage nozzles)
* KKK K14 turbocharger

===Replacement===
Production ended in September 2006, with about 350,000 LT models produced over nine years. Plans for the third generation of the &#x27;large transporter&#x27; from Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles were canceled and later that year, the Volkswagen Crafter was launched.

<text>Pressure points derive from the supposed meridian points in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Indian Ayurveda and Siddha medicine, and martial arts. They refer to areas on the human body that may produce significant pain or other effects when manipulated in a specific manner.

==History==

The earliest known concept of pressure points can be seen in the South Indian Varma kalai based on Siddha. The concept of pressure points is also present in the old school Japanese martial arts; in a 1942 article in the &quot;Shin Budo magazine&quot;, Takuma Hisa asserted the existence of a tradition attributing the first development of pressure-point attacks to Shinra Saburō Minamoto no Yoshimitsu (1045–1127).

Hancock and Higashi (1905) published a book which pointed out a number of vital points in Japanese martial arts.

Accounts of pressure-point fighting appeared in Chinese Wuxia fiction novels and became known by the name of Dim Mak, or &quot;Death Touch&quot;, in western popular culture in the 1960s.

While it is undisputed that there are sensitive points on the human body where even comparatively weak pressure may induce significant pain or serious injury, the association of &quot;kyūsho&quot; with notions of death have been harshly criticized.

<doc id="810549" wikidata="Q2499534" url="?curid=810549" title="Indecomposable module">
<text>In abstract algebra, a module is indecomposable if it is non-zero and cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-zero submodules.

Indecomposable is a weaker notion than simple module (which is also sometimes called irreducible module):
simple means &quot;no proper submodule&quot; ,
while indecomposable &quot;not expressible as &quot;.

A direct sum of indecomposables is called completely decomposable; this is weaker than being semisimple, which is a direct sum of simple modules.

A direct sum decomposition of a module into indecomposable modules is called an indecomposable decomposition.

== Motivation ==
In many situations, all modules of interest are completely decomposable; the indecomposable modules can then be thought of as the &quot;basic building blocks&quot;, the only objects that need to be studied. This is the case for modules over a
field or PID,
and underlies Jordan normal form of operators.

== Examples ==
=== Field ===
Modules over fields are vector spaces. A vector space is indecomposable if and only if its dimension is 1. So every vector space is completely decomposable (indeed, semisimple), with infinitely many summands if the dimension is infinite.

=== Principal ideal domain ===
Finitely-generated modules over principal ideal domains (PIDs) are classified by the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain: the primary decomposition is a decomposition into indecomposable modules, so every finitely-generated module over a PID is completely decomposable.

Explicitly, the modules of the form &quot;R&quot;/&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; for prime ideals &quot;p&quot; (including , which yields &quot;R&quot;) are indecomposable. Every finitely-generated &quot;R&quot;-module is a direct sum of these. Note that this is simple if and only if (or ); for example, the cyclic group of order 4, Z/4, is indecomposable but not simple – it has the subgroup 2Z/4 of order 2, but this does not have a complement.

Over the integers Z, modules are abelian groups. A finitely-generated abelian group is indecomposable if and only if it is isomorphic to Z or to a factor group of the form Z/&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;Z for some prime number &quot;p&quot; and some positive integer &quot;n&quot;. Every finitely-generated abelian group is a direct sum of (finitely many) indecomposable abelian groups.

There are, however, other indecomposable abelian groups which are not finitely generated; examples are the rational numbers Q and the Prüfer &quot;p&quot;-groups Z(&quot;p&quot;∞) for any prime number &quot;p&quot;.

For a fixed positive integer &quot;n&quot;, consider the ring &quot;R&quot; of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices with entries from the real numbers (or from any other field &quot;K&quot;). Then &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module (the scalar multiplication is matrix multiplication). This is up to isomorphism the only indecomposable module over &quot;R&quot;. Every left &quot;R&quot;-module is a direct sum of (finitely or infinitely many) copies of this module &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

==Facts==
Every simple module is indecomposable. The converse is not true in general, as is shown by the second example above.

By looking at the endomorphism ring of a module, one can tell whether the module is indecomposable: if and only if the endomorphism ring does not contain an idempotent element different from 0 and 1. (If &quot;f&quot; is such an idempotent endomorphism of &quot;M&quot;, then &quot;M&quot; is the direct sum of ker(&quot;f&quot;) and im(&quot;f&quot;).)

A module of finite length is indecomposable if and only if its endomorphism ring is local. Still more information about endomorphisms of finite-length indecomposables is provided by the Fitting lemma.

In the finite-length situation, decomposition into indecomposables is particularly useful, because of the Krull–Schmidt theorem: every finite-length module can be written as a direct sum of finitely many indecomposable modules, and this decomposition is essentially unique (meaning that if you have a different decomposition into indecomposables, then the summands of the first decomposition can be paired off with the summands of the second decomposition so that the members of each pair are isomorphic).

<doc id="810550" wikidata="Q1373278" url="?curid=810550" title="Glen Canyon National Recreation Area">
<text>Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (shortened to Glen Canyon NRA or GCNRA) is a national recreation area and conservation unit of the United States National Park Service that encompasses the area around Lake Powell and lower Cataract Canyon in Utah and Arizona, covering of mostly rugged high desert terrain. The recreation area is named for Glen Canyon, which was flooded by the Glen Canyon Dam, completed in 1966, and is now mostly submerged beneath the waters of Lake Powell.

Glen Canyon NRA borders Capitol Reef National Park and Canyonlands National Park on the north, Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument on the west, Vermilion Cliffs National Monument and the northeasternmost reaches of Grand Canyon National Park on the southwest, and the Navajo Nation on the southeast. The southwestern end of Glen Canyon NRA in Arizona can be accessed via U.S. Route 89 and State Route 98. State Route 95 and State Route 276 lead to the northeastern end of the recreation area in Utah.

Glen Canyon NRA was established in 1972 &quot;to provide for public use and enjoyment and to preserve the area&#x27;s scientific, historic, and scenic features.&quot; The stated purpose of Glen Canyon NRA is for recreation as well as preservation (whereas a national park may carry more emphasis on natural preservation). As such, the area has been developed for access to Lake Powell via five marinas, four public campgrounds, two small airports, and numerous houseboat rental concessions.

==Geology==

The geology of the area is dominated by the Glen Canyon Group, consisting of the Navajo Sandstone, Kayenta Formation, and Wingate Sandstone. The entire stratigraphic section includes rocks dating from the Cretaceous to Pennsylvanian periods.

=== Double Arch ===
A well-known rock formation named the Double Arch existed over Lake Powell. It collapsed on August 8, 2024.

==Recreation==
Lake Powell has nearly of fish-holding shoreline and provides opportunities to fish for largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and striped bass that swim in the waters of the recreation area.
Several local marinas and sports outfitters provide houseboats, powerboats, jet skis, kayaks, fishing gear, and related equipment to visitors.

==Graffiti Removal and Intervention Team (GRIT)==
With millions of visitors to the recreation area each year, it is inevitable that vandals will deface the rock faces of the canyon. Glen Canyon NRA has implemented a voluntourism program wherein volunteers sign up for a five-day houseboat trip during which they help remove graffiti from the canyon walls.

<doc id="810554" wikidata="Q117266" url="?curid=810554" title="Banana connector">
<text>A banana connector (commonly banana plug for the male, banana jack (or socket) for the female) is a single-wire (one conductor) electrical connector used for joining wires to equipment. The term 4 mm connector is also used, especially in Europe, although not all banana connectors will mate with 4 mm parts, and 2 mm banana connectors exist. Various styles of banana plug contacts exist, all based on the concept of spring metal applying outward force into the unsprung cylindrical jack to produce a snug fit with good electrical conductivity. Common types include: a solid pin split lengthwise and splayed slightly, a tip of four leaf springs, a cylinder with a single leaf spring on one side, a bundle of stiff wire, a central pin surrounded by a multiple-slit cylinder with a central bulge, or simple sheet spring metal rolled into a nearly complete cylinder. The plugs are frequently used to terminate patch cords for electronic test equipment such as laboratory power supply units, while sheathed banana plugs are common on multimeter probe leads.

==History==
Invention of the plug is claimed by two entities:
#The Hirschmann company claims it was invented by Richard Hirschmann in 1924. In 1929 Richard Hirschmann was granted a patent in Germany for an improved banana plug. The patent describes a banana plug that consists of two parts only. Not needing a small screw to hold the wire in place, like in conventional &quot;Bananensteckern&quot; (banana plugs), is presented as an advantage of the invention.
#The General Radio Company claims it introduced the banana plug in the United States in 1924. Various banana plug (type 274) products are shown in a September 1928 catalog and prices were listed in a July 1928 newsletter.

== Design ==

The original plug consists of a cylindrical metal pin about long. This pin length is still common in Europe and other parts of the world. However, other sizes have emerged, such as pins, which can commonly be found in the US. Other lengths between and are less common.

The pin&#x27;s diameter is nominally . The pin has one or more lengthwise springs that bulge outwards slightly, giving the appearance of a banana. Taking the springs into account, the actual diameter of a banana plug is typically a bit larger than 4 mm when not plugged in. When inserted into a matching 4 mm socket, the springs press against the sides of the socket, improving the electrical contact and preventing the pin from falling out. The other end of the plug has a lug connector to which a length of flexible insulated equipment wire can be attached, which is either screwed, soldered, or crimped into place. On banana plugs for laboratory use, an insulating plastic cover is usually fitted over this rear end of the connector, while banana plugs for speaker connections often use uninsulated metal bodies.

The rear end of a 4 mm plug often has a 4 mm hole drilled in it, either transversely or axially, or both, to accept the pin of another 4 mm plug. This type is called a stackable or stacking plug.

For high voltage use, sheathed versions of the banana plug and socket are used. These add an insulating sheath around both the male and female connectors to avoid accidental contact. The sheathed male plug will not work with an unsheathed female socket, but an unsheathed male plug will fit a sheathed female socket.

Individual banana plugs and jacks are commonly color-coded red and black, but are available in a wide variety of colors. Dual banana plugs are often black with some physical feature such as a molded ridge or thick tab, marked &quot;Gnd&quot; to indicate the relative polarity of the two plugs.

Besides plugging into specific banana jacks, banana plugs may plug into &quot;five-way&quot; or &quot;universal&quot; binding posts.

== Derived plugs ==

A number of widely used plugs are based on combining two or more banana plugs in a common plastic housing and other features for ease of use and to prevent accidental insertion in other such plugs. Many of these plugs are derived from the &quot;double banana&quot; plug, which consists simply of two banana plugs spaced apart (measured from center to center of each individual plug). The  inch spacing originated on General Radio test equipment during the 1920s, and their type 274-M dual-plug is a notable example from that period.

The housing may allow the connection of individual wires, a permanently attached coaxial cable providing both signal and ground, or a coaxial connector such as the BNC connector shown in the photo. Conventionally the tab located on one side of the dual banana plug denotes the ground, shell, or negative (reference) side of the connector.

== Miniature banana connectors ==

Various miniature versions of the banana connector have been introduced. One type is 2.6 mm in diameter and about one third the length of the standard connector, and is commonly used in model railway applications. These are substantially more fragile than the larger connectors. Multiple miniature banana connectors are usually spaced on inch centers. Another miniature type is the 2 mm banana connector, which is otherwise identical to the 4 mm version, including the various plug contact styles and availability of encased versions for high voltage applications.

==Pin tip jacks==
A closely related but different design is the so-called &quot;pin tip plug&quot; and matching &quot;pin tip jack&quot;. Its plug design resembles the banana plug but without the spring on the male pin; instead, it relies on spring action in the female jack, or tightly machined tolerances, to ensure good contact. The diameter of the male pin is 2 mm. The pin tip plug design was used where maximum density of connectors was desired (such as in pin plugboards), or where a very compact connector was needed.

==Wander plug==

These superficially similar plugs were widely used in the UK and elsewhere until the 1960s. A significant use was for connecting the separate HT (High Tension, usually 90 volts) and grid bias batteries in early battery powered valve (tube) radios and for the antenna and earth (ground) connections and external loudspeaker in both mains and battery powered valve radios. The battery terminals were short (approximately 6 mm to 10 mm) bell-mouthed brass tubes of nominal internal diameter. The wander plug&#x27;s name may have derived from its need to &quot;wander about&quot; when setting the correct grid bias voltage(s) for the most economical operation of the radio. 

The wander plug was always used in a rigid socket and therefore the pin end was split to allow some elasticity and provide a secure fit in the socket. It often featured a machined brass component which formed the pin contact (which was split) and the means of connecting the external wire, clamped by means of a screw-on coloured hard plastic cap. Another design used an actual split pin of plated steel, the parallel ends of which formed the plug tip. It featured a machined brass component with an internal bore of just over inch, a transverse slot to accommodate the eye end of the split pin, and an external screw thread to engage the coloured hard plastic cap, tightening of which trapped the stripped end of the wire in the eye of the split pin to establish a secure connection.

The wander plug may have pre-dated the banana plug, but was virtually obsolete by the 1970s, by which time most of the equipment requiring them was long obsolete.

Wander plugs generally would not inter-mate successfully with banana sockets, and attempts to do so by spreading the brass tip often ended with its fracture. The tip of some banana plugs could be forced into some sockets intended for wander plugs, but would invariably be insecure.

== Electrical safety ==

Quality banana plugs and cables are typically rated for 30 V at 15 A. Cheaper cables may have one or more downsides: lower quality plugs, smaller diameter wire, lower strand count wire, thinner insulation, or lower quality insulation. Unsheathed banana connectors are not usually rated for mains voltage.

One reason why banana connectors are not rated for mains usage is that an exposed banana plug or socket can present a shock hazard if connected to an energized source. A plug that is only partially inserted into a jack can also present a risk of accidental contact, because the conductive surface of the plug will not be completely covered. This can especially happen if a 20 mm long plug is inserted into a socket that is only intended for 15 mm long plugs. Some banana plugs have exposed set screws that are electrically connected to the wire. When stacking plugs using transverse holes in a plug, large parts of the pin of the second plug are exposed. Another reason why banana connectors are not rated for mains usage is the lack of double insulation of wires and connectors. The hazards include electric shock, electrocution, burns from accidental short circuits, and damage to the attached equipment. 

Where electrical safety is an issue, sheathed plugs and sockets are used. These plugs have fixed or sliding sheaths or other devices to protect the user from accidental contact with live conductors, but are still largely compatible with the original design. When inserted, the sheaths of the plug and socket overlap fully, ensuring that no live metal is exposed. A typical design is now required (IEC 61010) on multimeter test leads and several other types of measurement and laboratory equipment. In this design, the metal banana plug is entirely sheathed in a plastic tube and inserts into a deeply recessed jack in the multimeter. Alternatively, the equipment may use a deeply recessed male banana plug, while the test lead uses a sheathed banana jack. Additionally, the test lead wire must be made with insulation rated for higher voltages.

In most European countries, the standard mains power receptacle will physically accept banana and even US-style &quot;double banana&quot; plugs (the standard US pin spacing of is close enough to the mains plug spacing of about 19 mm, and the pin diameter is also compatible), leading to a risk of electrical shock. For this reason, throughout the European Union, audio amplifiers and loudspeakers that accept banana plugs must have plastic plugs in their sockets which can be manually removed by the user. The UK was included in the prohibition even though such mains sockets were not used there.

<doc id="810560" wikidata="Q1500251" url="?curid=810560" title="Volkswagen Type 3">
<text>The Volkswagen Type 3 is a compact car manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen from 1961 to 1973. Introduced at the 1961 Frankfurt International Motor Show, the &quot;IAA&quot;, the Type 3 was marketed as the Volkswagen 1500 and later as the Volkswagen 1600, in two-door notchback, fastback, and station wagon body styles, the latter marketed as the &#x27;Squareback&#x27; in the United States.

The Type 3 diversified Volkswagen&#x27;s product range beyond the existing models—the Type 1 Beetles, Type 14 Karmann Ghia, Type 2 vans and pickups—while retaining Volkswagen&#x27;s hallmark engineering features: the air-cooled rear-engine, rear-wheel drive train, body-on-chassis construction (with a backbone chassis integrated into the car&#x27;s floorpan), as well as torsion bar front and rear suspension.

Despite using the Beetle&#x27;s wheelbase, the Type 3 was conceived as a larger car, offering a larger engine and increased cargo and passenger volume—the latter from its increased length and width as well as from its slab-sided, &quot;Ponton&quot; styling, maximizing the platform&#x27;s footprint.

==Background==
The Type 3 emulated major features of the Type 1 Beetle, using a low-profile version of Volkswagen&#x27;s rear-engined, 4-cylinder air-cooled engine, as well as body-on-chassis construction (the body bolts to a frame that includes the floor pan), retaining the same wheelbase – but using more contemporary and slab-sided &quot;Ponton&quot; styling, in contrast to the Type 1&#x27;s articulated fenders and running boards. VW finalized the design by 1959 with prototypes ready for testing by 1960. Secrecy was such that even at the 1960 Geneva Auto Show, VW denied they were readying a new design. In 1961 VW announced the new line as the &quot;VW 1500&quot;.

Production began in August 1961, a month before launch, of the Volkswagen 1500 Notchback, encompassing three-box styling in a Notchback saloon body. Production of the Karmann Ghia 1500 (also known as the Type 34 Karmann Ghia) with a coupé body commenced in November 1961 and deliveries started in January 1962. The station wagon/estate-bodied Variant (marketed as the Squareback in the US) followed, with the first cars produced in February 1962. Twelve prototype convertibles based on the 1500 Notchback were also built, but never entered production.

The Fastback, or TL version, a fastback coupé, arrived in August 1965, along with the 1600 engine. Volkswagen&#x27;s intention was that this model should replace the Notchback, which is what happened in the UK market. However, in other markets, including the German domestic market, the number of customers preferring the older Notchback shaped car was higher than foreseen, and in the end both Notchback and Fastback remained in production until July 1973. Type 3s were made in a variety of trim levels with different features for different markets. Top end models featured more chrome, more brite trim, and full carpeting, and, starting in mid-1968, were available with a fully automatic transmission. Factory installed gasoline powered heaters were a factory installed option available in some markets. Air conditioning and radios were never factory installed but were often available as dealer installed options.

Volkswagen of America began marketing the Type 3 Squarebacks and Fastbacks for the 1966 model year, but they never imported the Notchback or Type 34 Karmann Ghia. The Type 3 was competing in the market with the Chevrolet Corvair that had been previously introduced in the United States in 1960, which incorporated a 6-cylinder rear-mounted air-cooled engine in notchback and station wagon body style, as well as a compact van and pickup derived from the platform. It also competed in the US with the Renault 8 which also offered a rear engine and rear drive sedan.

A unique feature of all four Type 3 models was that configuration of the flat 4 engine gave the cars both front and rear luggage volumes; a fact highlighted in VW&#x27;s advertising.

For the 1968 model year, the Type 3 1600E (&quot;Einspritzung&quot;) models were the first mass produced automobiles with electronic fuel injection available as optional equipment. This was the introduction of the Bosch D-Jetronic) fuel injection, which was available only in VW Type 3s for its first two years. The 1600 cc D-Jetronic fuel injection engine was standard equipment for all Type 3s sold in the US for model years 1968 thru 1973, but single and dual carb engines remained as available options for many markets around the world until the end of Type 3 production.

In mid-1968, a three-speed fully automatic transaxle became available. With the automatic came a CV-jointed independent rear suspension (IRS), replacing the swing axle (also IRS) set-up. This 1968 mid-year introduction was only available in conjunction with the dual carb 1600 cc Type 3 engine. For 1969, the CV-jointed rear axle became standard with both automatic and manual transmissions, and the automatic transmission was also offered combined with the D-Jetronic 1600 cc fuel injection engine. The swing axle rear suspension remained available for some markets that had poorer quality roads.

Type 3 models received a facelift in 1970, with a revised front end, its nose extended by adding to the luggage capacity. At the same time Type 3s received revised square-section bumpers (with integral rubber strips in some markets), as well as larger tail lamps and front indicators.

Volkswagen offered the Type 3 in a lower trim level in Europe, marketed as the 1600A. In the US, and for 1973 only, Volkswagen of America offered two trim levels of the Type 3 Fastback in the US, marketed as the &quot;Type 3 Sedan&quot; and &quot;Type 3 Basic Compact&quot;. The Basic Compact trim level featured reduced content, including limited color and upholstery availability; deletion of exterior belt line chrome trim, clock, and electric-heated rear window defogger—and using painted vent widow frames, a black cardboard front trunk liner over the gas tank without a liner on the sides of the trunk or over the firewall, and plain vinyl door panels without door pockets and rubber mats in lieu of interior carpet.

While the Type 3 was a more modern design, it never reached the same level of popularity as the Beetle. As Volkswagen started to produce front-wheel-drive water-cooled designs, production ended in 1973 at the Wolfsburg plant. The Wolfsburg production facilities were then retooled to build the Golf, known as the Rabbit in the US., which eventually replaced the Type 1 as Volkswagen&#x27;s best-selling sedan. Production of the Type 3 moved to VW&#x27;s new Emden plant, which was retooled later in 1973 to build the first-generation Passat (also marketed as the &quot;Dasher&quot;).

==Engine and drivetrain==
The Type 3 was initially equipped with a 1.5 L (1493 cc) engine based on the air-cooled 1192 cc flat-4 found in the Type 1, but given a 69 mm stroke it became the basis for the 1300 cc, 1500 cc and 1600 cc engines that followed in the later Beetle (Type 1) and Volkswagen Type 2 T1 and T2. While the long block remained the same as the Type 1, the engine cooling was redesigned by putting the fan on the end of the crankshaft instead of on the generator. This reduced the height of the engine profile, allowing greater cargo volume and earning its nicknames: the &quot;pancake&quot; or &quot;suitcase&quot; engine. 1600 cc (1584 cc) engine options became available starting in the 1966 model year, but the 1500 cc options remained available thru the end of Type 3 production. Both displacements were available in low compression and high compression versions, so there were low and high compression single carb engines, and low and high compression dual carb engines. The D-Jetronic fuel injection engine was only made in the high compression configuration.

Starting with the 1966 model year, Type 3 engine numbers came with a letter prefix that indicated the engine type. For 1500 cc (all single carb) engines the low compression prefix was M while the high compression prefix was K. For the 1600 cc (all dual carb) engines, the low compression prefix was P and the high compression prefix was T. Fuel injected engines have a U (or X for 1972–73 California cars.)

The Type 3 used a similar transmission to the Beetle but with higher ratios (4.125 R&amp;P v 4.375 R&amp;P) and longer axles. Unlike the Beetle (Type 1), the Type 3 engine and transmission unit was mounted into a subframe (which contained the complete rear suspension), which was then rubber-mounted to the floorpan and body, thereby isolating vibration and road noise from the passenger space.

The original Volkswagen 1500 used a single side-draught 32 mm Solex PHN carburetor. In August 1963 VW introduced twin-carburetor versions, these were, respectively the Volkswagen 1500 &#x27;N&#x27; (Normal), rated at , and the 1500 &#x27;S&#x27; (Super), which had high-compression (8.5:1) domed 83 mm pistons and twin downdraught 32 mm Solex PDSIT carburetors for more power.

1600 cc Type 3 engine options were added in 1966 (August 1965) and in 1968 the 1600 cc Type 3 became the world&#x27;s first volume production car to feature electronic fuel injection – designed by Bosch. The Bosch D-Jetronic system was offered on the Volkswagen 1600 TE &amp; LE version (E designating &quot;Einspritzung&quot; or &quot;injection&quot; in German). A similar Bosch D-Jetronic injection system was used in the later VW Type 4, and some models of the VW-Porsche 914/4. In mid-1968 a semi automatic 3 speed transmission was introduced installed together with the dual carb engine; this automatic transmission was offered together with the fuel injected engine starting with the 1969 model year.

A notable advance from the Type 1 to the Type 3 was the front suspension. Although similar to the Type 1, it was the first Volkswagen front suspension to incorporate transverse round torsion bars, as opposed to the Type 1&#x27;s torsion leaves. The Type 3&#x27;s torsion bars are cross-mounted in the lower tube, so that each individual torsion bar spans the full width of the car, the upper tube containing an anti-roll bar that connects the upper trailing links to each other. The complete front suspension unit is rubber-mounted to the car&#x27;s floorpan. In 1969 the rear suspension was upgraded to double jointed CV joint semi trailing arm suspension (sometimes called &quot;IRS&quot; by VW enthusiasts to differentiate it from the previous IRS swing-axle type.)

The Type 3 offered both front and rear enclosed luggage areas, with cargo accessible via both the boot (trunk) and the bonnet (hood). In each of the four body styles (Notchback, Squareback, Fastback, and Ghia) the engine is located under and accessed by a panel on the floor of the rear cargo area.

This engine placement was highlighted in a period Volkswagen television commercial for the American market. It featured a very young Dustin Hoffman who shows the fastback model and explains its technical features but is unable to locate the engine. The ad closed with the copy, &quot;Come into your Volkswagen dealer. They&#x27;ll show you where the motor is.&quot;

The original Type 3 with 5-bolt wheels (5 × 205 mm PCD) used twin leading shoe drum brakes at the front. In August 1965 (the 1966 model year) these were replaced by front disc brakes, coinciding with the introduction of the Fastback and 1600 engine (Australian-built models retained drum front brakes until August 1967). These have 4-bolt wheels (4 × 130 mm PCD) with 8 cooling slots. Rear brakes were always leading / trailing shoe drums.

===Australian production===
The Type 3 was manufactured at Clayton in Victoria, Australia, from 1963 in sedan, station wagon and sedan delivery body styles. In 1965, the Fastback was introduced, fully imported from Germany.

Panel van versions (based on the 1500 &#x27;N&#x27;) feature a marine ply wood loading area with zinc plated steel protector strips, one sun visor (for the driver), a clock delete panel, and no fixed side windows. All Australian-assembled panel vans were fitted with a metal ID tag behind the spare wheel with a prefix of PV, followed by the number, stamped by hand. There are approximately 10 known surviving panel vans from the estimated original production run of 500 and a further 10 to 15 from German manufacture.

Following the cessation of all local manufacturing by Volkswagen Australasia in 1968, the Type 3 was assembled from CKD kits by Motor Producers Limited at the same Clayton facility through to 1973.

==Related models==
===Type 34 Karmann Ghia===
In 1961, Volkswagen introduced the VW 1500 Karmann Ghia, or Type 34, based on its new Type 3 platform, featuring Volkswagen&#x27;s new flat 1500 cc engine design, and styling by Italian engineer Sergio Sartorelli at Carrozzeria Ghia.

Until it was replaced by the VW-Porsche 914, it was the most expensive, and most luxurious passenger car VW manufactured in the 1960s. 42,505 (plus 17 prototype convertibles) were manufactured from 1962–1969.

Although the Type 34 was available in most countries, it was not offered officially in the U.S., VW&#x27;s largest and most important export market.

=== Brazilian Type 3===
The three-box Type 3 was launched in Brazil in 1968, it was heavily based on Volkswagen&#x27;s EA 97 prototype of 1960 with some restyling penned by Márcio Piancastelli and four doors. It met with little success, nicknamed &quot;Zé do Caixão&quot; (meaning &quot;Coffin Joe&quot;, after a popular Brazilian horror movie maker) for its boxy shape. It was discontinued in 1970.

The fastback version, the Volkswagen TL, fared somewhat better, remaining in production from 1970 to 1976, originally as a two-door and later as a four-door version.

As in Germany, the original Karmann Ghia was replaced with the Type 3-based Karmann Ghia TC (Touring Coupé), but with a distinct look from the German Karmann Ghia Type 34.

Neither enjoyed as much success as its estate-bodied sibling, the Variant. The 3-door Variant was produced from 1969 to 1977, followed by an updated successor with squarer body (similar to the Brasilia), the Variant II, which was produced from 1977 to 1981.

Brazilian Type 3s used the front suspension from the Type 1 with its laminated half-width torsion bars in top and bottom tubes and solidly mounted to the floorpan, unlike the German Type 3&#x27;s rubber mounted unit with full-width crossed round bars in the lower tube and anti-roll bar in the top one. The only exception among the Brazilian Type 3s was the Variant II, which was equipped with a front MacPherson strut.
==Argentinian Dodge 1500-based Volkswagen 1500==

A &quot;Volkswagen 1500&quot; unrelated to the Type 3 model 1500 was sold during the 1980s in Argentina based upon the Dodge 1500 manufactured in that country.

In 1980, Volkswagen bought the Argentinian company &quot;Chrysler Fevre Argentina SAIC&quot;, inheriting some Dodge / Chrysler models and renaming the company &quot;Volkswagen Argentina SA&quot;. One of the models was the Dodge 1500 (also the Dodge 1800) which the newly taken-over company re-badged as Volkswagen 1500 for the Argentinian market. The estate was known as the Volkswagen 1500 Rural. Both variants continued to be sold until 1988.

The car, which was based on the Hillman Avenger, had also been sold in Brazil, where it was known as the Dodge Polara. This version ceased in 1981, shortly after Volkswagen&#x27;s purchase of the tooling in Argentina. The same car was available earlier in the 1970s in North America as the Plymouth Cricket.

No parts of the Dodge 1500/&quot;Volkswagen 1500&quot; overlap with the Volkswagen Type 3 model 1500, or any other Volkswagen product.

<doc id="810570" wikidata="Q520537" url="?curid=810570" title="John George Children">
<text>John George Children FRS FRSE FLS PRES (18 May 1777 – 1 January 1852 in Halstead, Kent) was a British chemist, mineralogist and zoologist. He was a friend of Sir Humphry Davy, who helped him secure a controversial appointment to a post in the British Museum. Along with Davy he built a large galvanic cell, assisted him in experiments and invented a method to extract silver from ore without the need for mercury. Children was also the founding president of the Royal Entomological Society. His daughter Anna Atkins became a pioneer of botanical photography.

==Personal life==
John George was born on 18 May 1777 at Ferox Hall, Tonbridge, Kent. His father, George Children FRS (1742–1818), a banker, belonged to a family that lived at the home, near Nether Street in Hildenborough; his mother, Susanna, who was the daughter of Rev. Thomas Marshall Jordan of West Farleigh, died six days after he was born.

Children studied at Tonbridge School, Eton College and later at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. In 1798, he married Hester Anna Holwell, granddaughter of John Zephaniah Holwell. After her unexpected passing, in 1800, he began to travel with more regularity. He also established a chemical laboratory at Ferox Hall. He went on to marry another woman, Caroline Wise (daughter of George Furlong Wise of Woolston), in 1809; she also died the following year. In 1812 the collapse of the Tonbridge Bank led to financial problems. In 1816 his father was declared bankrupt. It was then that he found work as a librarian. In 1819, he married a Mrs. Towers, the two remaining together until her death, twenty years later, in 1839.

Children served briefly in the West Kent militia but resigned in 1805 due to poor health. In 1808 he travelled to the battlefield of Vimiero in Portugal. In 1815, Children travelled to the battlefield at Waterloo along with his daughter Anna and a cousin Lieutenant George Whitehead. There he noticed that the Waterloo Elm, a tree under which the Duke of Wellington had made his headquarters, was being stripped bare by souvenir-hunters. Anna drew a picture of the tree. He purchased the tree with the intent that it should be converted into furniture and gifted to the Prince Regent. Once purchased, he had the tree made into pieces of furniture by Thomas Chippendale at Apsley House and Belvoir Castle. An armchair was sent to Carlton House on 24 February 1821 which is now in the Royal Collection. A Latin inscription on the chair was based on a suggestion from the Marquess of Wellesley.

He died at Halstead Place, Kent.

==Scientific career==
Children was a friend of Sir Humphry Davy and together they conducted several experiments. In 1808 he visited Spain where he met Joseph Blanco White. In 1813 he constructed a large galvanic cell and conducted experiments using them. These were published in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; in 1815 and for this he received the Royal Institution medal in 1828. Following the bankruptcy of his father, he began to work on a gunpowder business with Davy but this did not last. In 1822, he found a position as an assistant librarian through Lord Camden in the Department of Antiquities at the British Museum when he was appointed assistant keeper of the Natural History Department in succession to William Elford Leach. The appointment, influenced by Sir Humphry Davy, was controversial as he was less qualified than another applicant, William Swainson. Children found himself poorly qualified in zoology and depended greatly on John Edward Gray who worked as a day-worker. Gray&#x27;s own application to the post that Children held had been passed over due to rivalries with influential members of the Linnean Society. Some visitors to the British Museum like Edward Blyth found him uncooperative. After the division of the Department into three sections in 1837 he became keeper of the Department of Zoology, retiring in 1840 and succeeded by his assistant John Edward Gray. After his retirement he took an interest in astronomy.

Around 1823-24, there was an interest in silver mining in South America and there was a search for silver extraction techniques that did not need expensive mercury. Children found a process that he sold to several companies including Real del Monte and United Mexicans.

Children was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1807, and served as the society&#x27;s secretary in 1826, and from 1830 to 1837. In 1833, he was founding president of what became the Royal Entomological Society of London. His name is commemorated in the names of several species, most described by Gray or his brother, including the Australian Children&#x27;s python, &quot;Antaresia childreni&quot;, the Australian stick insect &quot;Tropidoderus childrenii&quot;, the North American lady beetle &quot;Exochomus childreni&quot; as well as a mineral called childrenite. John James Audubon named &quot;Sylvia childrenii&quot; (or Children&#x27;s warbler) after him, stating &quot;I have named it after my most esteemed friend, J. G. Children, Esq. of the British Museum, as a tribute of sincere gratitude for the unremitted kindness which he has shewn me&quot; but that is a junior name as the specimen it was based on was of a juvenile of the already described yellow warbler.

==Family==
Children&#x27;s only daughter (from his first wife Hester Anna) was Anna Atkins, a botanist, who is best known for her book of cyanotype photograms of algae, the first book of exclusively photographic images ever made. She wrote a memoir on the life of her father which included several unpublished poems.

<text>Abarema is a neotropical genus in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Brazil, Cuba, and Venezuela. Most of the species can be found in the Amazon Basin and the Guyana Highlands. They have a deep-green fernlike foliage, with bipinnately compound leaves.

==Taxonomy==
This genus has been proven to be polyphyletic under its previous circumscription. As a result of the genetic evidence, the genera &quot;Jupunba&quot; and &quot;Punjuba&quot; were separated from &quot;Abarema&quot;.

===Species===
Following the 1996 revision, there are currently about 45 species. In older works, the entire genus is usually included within &quot;Pithecellobium&quot;.

<doc id="810573" wikidata="Q933636" url="?curid=810573" title="Volkswagen Type 4">
<text>The Volkswagen Type 4 is a compact / midsize family car, manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen of Germany as a Dsegment car from 1968 to 1974 in two-door and four-door sedan as well as two-door station wagon body styles. The Type 4 evolved through two generations, the 411 (1968–1972) and 412 series (1972–1974).

Designed under the direction of Heinrich Nordhoff and introduced at the Paris Motor Show in October 1968, the 411 was Volkswagen&#x27;s largest passenger vehicle with the company&#x27;s largest engine – with styling credited to Carrozzeria Pininfarina, who at the time had an advisory contract with Volkswagen. The cars retained VW&#x27;s trademark air-cooled, rear placement, rear-wheel drive, boxer engine with a front/rear weight distribution of 45/55% and a forward cargo storage — while also introducing design and engineering departures for the company – including a completely flat passenger area floor and suspension using control arms and MacPherson struts. Volkswagen had prototyped a notchback sedan and convertible versions of the 411, without introducing them to production.

Over six-years, Type 4 production reached 367,728, compared to 210,082 of the subsequent Volkswagen K70 over four model years. Sales reached 119,627 in the United States (1971-1974); 119,094 in Germany; 34,452 in South Africa and 13,367 in the United Kingdom.

Volkswagen&#x27;s last air-cooled sedans and wagons, (aside from the Brasília which carried on until 1982) the Type 4 models were succeeded by the first generation Passat.

==Features==
As Volkswagen&#x27;s first 4-door saloon, the Type 4 also introduced unibody construction, coil springs, trailing wishbone rear suspension, hydraulic clutch manual transmission – as well as MacPherson strut front suspension: the 411&#x27;s front suspension layout was subsequently adopted for the VW Type 1 1302/1303 (&quot;Super Beetle&quot;).

When the Type 4 was discontinued in 1974, its engine carried on as the power plant for the larger-engined Volkswagen Type 2s, produced from 1972 to 1979, and for the later Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) bus from 1980 until 1983.

==411==
At launch, the 411 featured a 1679 cc engine with twin carburetors, subsequently modified in 1969 with Bosch D-Jetronic electronic fuel injection and with claimed power output increased from . This fuel-injected engine was shared with the mid-engined Porsche 914, also launched in 1969. European 411 nomenclature highlighted the fuel injection with the suffix &#x27;E&#x27; (for &quot;Einspritzung&quot;). Revisions in 1969 also included replacement of the single oval headlights with twin round headlights.

The Type 4&#x27;s battery was located under the left hand front seat. All models featured ventless driver and front passenger windows, notched on their leading edge to provide draught-free ventilation, no cost metallic paint, radial ply tires, full carpeting, clock, electric rear window demister, flow-through ventilation, undercoating, and a thermostatically controlled auxiliary heating system, specifically, a gasoline-operated heater model BA4 by Eberspächer, fired by a spark plug, accessible from a hidden rear window deck plate.

The 411 was also assembled in South Africa beginning in 1969, in two- or four-door configurations. The four-door only came as a DeLuxe and was available with an optional automatic transmission, while the two-door was available either as a Standard or a DeLuxe.

In 1968, Karmann presented a 411-based cabriolet prototype which did not enter production.

==412==
The 412 replaced the 411 in August 1972 in Germany, The redesign by noted stylist Brooks Stevens featured Halogen lights, revised headlight surrounds and nose panels. In August 1973 (for the 1974 model year), the engine capacity was raised to 1795 cc and fuel management reverted to a twin carburettor system; the 412LE was renamed 412LS. This was to be the last model year for the 412, with production ending in June 1974.

The visual design of the Volkswagen 412 Variant was retained when the Brazilian Type 3 models TL, Variant, Variant II, and later Brazilian Variant-based Volkswagen Brasilia were produced in Brazil, primarily for the Latin American markets.

In February 1974, the four-door 412L was priced at DM 10,995 (DM 11,145 for the 412 LS) in the German home market.

The 412 was also built in South Africa from 1972 to 1974. The specification varied somewhat from European models, with the omission of the petrol heater, no rear window de-fogger as standard and with different paint options and interior trim. A total of 34,452 of the Type 4 (411 and 412) were produced in South Africa between 1969 and 1974.

<text>Hartlebury is a village and civil parish in the Wychavon district of Worcestershire, England. It is south of Kidderminster. The village had a population of 2,549 in the 2001 Census.

The village is green-buffered from surrounding villages except for the village of Waresley which is contiguous with Hartlebury. The civil parish covering the village also includes the outlying villages of Crossway Green and Torton.

==History==
===Hartlebury Castle===

Hartlebury Castle was built in the mid-13th century as a fortified manor house. Until 2007 it was the residence of the Bishop of Worcester, with two-thirds of the building leased out to Worcestershire County Council as the Worcestershire County Museum. Hartlebury Castle is a Grade I listed building. It is about a mile to the west of the village and half a mile to the west of the church.

===Converted buildings===
=== Queen Elizabeth Grammar School ===
Queen Elizabeth (I) Grammar School (the regnal number was added in 1952 on the accession of Elizabeth II) was in Hartlebury until 1977. The earliest record of the precursor to the school is in &quot;Domesday Book&quot; compiled in 1086. Other early accounts date to 1400, well before Harrow and Rugby were founded. The school was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth I in 1557. Originally a private boys school, it was taken over by the State, and was closed when it was merged in 1977 with King Charles I Grammar School, Kidderminster, and The Kidderminster Girls High School to form King Charles I School. The oldest building standing was converted to a house. Its magnificent New Building has commanding views over fields and woodland and rescued from demolition by its alumni association.

===New Elizabethan School===
A very small independent school unconnected educationally with Hartlebury School opened in 2008: the fee-paying New Elizabethan School was set up to cater for children &quot;who have found learning and school attendance difficult&quot; on part of the Hartlebury School site. A private school, for young boys and girls, operated there 1979–2007, Bowbrook School — renamed Hartlebury Independent School in 1999, then Hartlebury School in 2000. In 2007, it became a charitable organisation. Then in 2008 it was re-launched in its new form.

==Former buildings==
===The Worcestershire house===

The house later known as The Worcestershire House was a very old house in Hartlebury, dismantled and re-assembled at the Frontier Culture Museum of Virginia, USA, in 1992. The John Smith (Smyth or Smythe) family built it in the 1630s. An example of the Tudor frame variety of Timber framing construction, it was dismantled in 1970 and shipped.

== Notable people ==

* Henry Eliot Howard, ornithologist, conducted much of his research in the grounds of his home, &#x27;Clareland&#x27;, which is extant, and is Grade II listed.
* Daniel J. Collins, musician, grew up here. His notable works include his debut album &#x27;The Parallel Universe&#x27; – released 25 March 2024. He took part in Bewdley Youth Festival&#x27;s Wyre Forest Young Musician of The Year awards 2024 where he received best &#x27;Solo Instrumentalist&#x27;.

<text>Pies Descalzos (, ) is the third studio album by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, released on 6 October 1995, by Sony Music Colombia. Its music incorporates Latin pop styles, additionally experimenting with pop rock elements. Looking to revive her struggling career after the commercial failures of her first two studio efforts &quot;Magia&quot; and &quot;Peligro&quot;, she assumed a prominent position in its production. Luis Fernando Ochoa co-wrote each of the eleven tracks on the record with Shakira and produced the whole album.

&quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented it as a strong debut showing. Commercially, the project became Shakira&#x27;s breakthrough record, with which she established notability throughout Latin America. It was awarded the &quot;Diamond Prism&quot; in her native Colombia, acknowledging one million copies sold in the nation. The album additionally peaked at numbers three and five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Albums and Latin Albums component charts, respectively. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was also a breakthrough for Shakira in the country according to John Lannert of &quot;Billboard&quot;.

Six singles were released from &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot;, all of which attained commercial success in the United States. Its lead single &quot;Estoy Aquí&quot; peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Songs component chart, and was her first track promoted through an accompanying music video. Follow-up singles &quot;¿Dónde Estás Corazón?&quot;, &quot;Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos&#x27;, &quot;Un Poco de Amor&quot;, &quot;Antología&quot;, and &quot;Se Quiere, Se Mata&quot; peaked within the top 20 of the chart.

==Background ==

In 1990, a 13-year-old Shakira signed a recording contract with Sony Music. Her debut studio album &quot;Magia&quot; was released in 1991, and largely consisted of tracks she had written since she was eight years old. Commercially, the project struggled, selling an underwhelming 1,200 copies in her native Colombia. Her follow-up record &quot;Peligro&quot; was released in 1993, and suffered a similar failure. Consequently, Shakira took a two-year hiatus, allowing her to complete her high school education. Looking to revive her struggling career, Shakira decided to make an international debut studio album.
&quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; was produced on a budget of $100,000, since it was expected to only move 100,000 copies.

==Composition==

&quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; primarily focuses on Latin pop genres, though it experiments with pop rock styles. Assuming a prominent position in its production, she co-wrote each of the 11 tracks included on the record. The albums opens with &quot;Estoy Aquí&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Here&quot;), which sees prominent uses of guitar instrumentation. Lyrically, it discusses a willingness to correct a failed relationship. The pop ballad &quot;Antología&quot; (&quot;Anthology&quot;) notes an appreciation of the knowledge a lover has shared. &quot;Un Poco de Amor&quot; (&quot;A Little Bit of Love&quot;) states that Shakira is waiting to find someone who loves her. It became her first track to include phrases in English, performed by the uncredited Howard Glasford, and additionally experiments with elements of reggae music.

The guitar-driven &quot;Quiero&quot; (&quot;I Want&quot;) explains Shakira&#x27;s happiness upon the return of a lover. Similarly, the mid-tempo &quot;Te Necesito&quot; (&quot;I Need You&quot;) and the upbeat &quot;Vuelve&quot; (&quot;Return&quot;) describe her yearning for a romantic partner to re-enter her life. &quot;Te Espero Sentada&quot; (&quot;I Wait Sitting&quot;) expresses a desire for a romantic partner to be aware of the sorrow his absence brings to Shakira. &quot;Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos&quot; (&quot;Bare Feet, White Dreams&quot;) suggests that one is happiest when living a carefree lifestyle, while &quot;Pienso en Ti&quot; (&quot;I Think of You&quot;) notes that Shakira thinks more about a lover as times progresses. The penultimate track &quot;¿Dónde Estás Corazón?&quot; (&quot;Where Are You Love?&quot;) asks that her boyfriend comes back to her. The album closes with its eleventh track &quot;Se Quiere, Se Mata&quot; (&quot;You Want, You Kill&quot;), which tells the story of expectant parents Braulio and Dana, and sees the usage of a harmonica during its chorus.

The track peaked at numbers 3 and 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Songs and Latin Songs charts, respectively. Its music video was directed by Gustavo Garzón, and shows various scenes of Shakira holding photographs, sitting in a red chair, and singing in the rain.

<text>The Battle of Heiligerlee (Heiligerlee, Groningen, 23 May 1568) was fought between Dutch rebels and the Spanish army of Friesland. It was the first Dutch victory during the Eighty Years&#x27; War.

The Groningen province of the Spanish Netherlands was invaded by an army consisting of 3,900 infantry, led by Louis of Nassau, and 200 cavalry, led by Adolf of Nassau. Both of them were brothers of William I of Orange. The intention was to begin an armed uprising against the Spanish rulers of the Netherlands.
The Stadtholder of Friesland and also Duke of Aremberg, Johan de Ligne, had an army of 3,200 infantry and 20 cavalry.

Aremberg initially avoided confrontation and awaited reinforcements from the Count of Meghem. However, on 23 May, Adolf&#x27;s cavalry lured him to an ambush at the monastery of Heiligerlee. Louis&#x27;s infantry made up the bulk of the army and defeated the Spanish force which lost 460 men, and the invading force lost 50, including Adolf. The rebels captured seven cannons.

The invading force, however, did not capture any cities and was soon defeated at the Battle of Jemmingen.

The death of Adolf of Nassau is mentioned in the Dutch national anthem (fourth verse):
:&quot;Graef Adolff is ghebleven, In Vriesland in den slaech,&quot;
:&quot;Count Adolf has died, in Friesland, in the battle&quot;

<text>Jean-Daniel Nicoud (born 31 August 1938), is a Swiss computer scientist, noted for inventing a computer mouse with an optical encoder and the CALM (Common Assembly Language for microprocessors).

He obtained a degree in physics at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 1963. Around 1965, he became interested in logical systems. He obtained his PhD at the EPFL in 1970 and became a professor in 1973. 

His laboratory, LAMI (&quot;LAboratoire de Micro-Informatique&quot;), developed the Smaky computer, in addition to the optical computer mouse, an update of the traditional kinetic mouse invented by Douglas Engelbart. The Khepera mobile robot was also developed at the LAMI.

He left the EPFL in August 2000 and is actively innovating in his private company, DIDEL, especially in the area of miniature ultralight aircraft (below 10 g airplanes). His airplane was used in a publication that received a best paper award in IROS 2006 conference.

<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Aylesbury is a category C training prison situated in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England. It is located on the north side of the town centre, on Bierton Road and is operated by His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service.

==History==
There has been a prison or gaol of some description in Aylesbury since 1810. The current prison has been on its present site since 1847. It is of early Victorian design and was modelled on Reading County Gaol, The site was in an area of public buildings that also included the workhouse (formerly the Tindal Centre) and the Manor House Hospital.

Since construction, the prison has gone through a variety of changes, starting as a county gaol, then became an adult women&#x27;s prison in 1890, changing to a girls&#x27; borstal in the 1930s, and between 1959 and 1961 was an adult male prison, after which it became a male &quot;YOI&quot;, and since 1989 has held only male long-term prisoners.

==Operation==
In 1998 HMP Aylesbury was criticised after an inspection report highlighted its poor health regime, which saw the rapid turnover of five senior medical officers in two years. The report opened up a wider debate about the pay of medical staff in UK prisons compared to those in the NHS.

In 2001 the Imam for HMP Aylesbury was suspended after allegations of inappropriate comments after the September 11 New York terror attacks. A year after this a study of prisoners&#x27; diets at Aylesbury (conducted by Surrey University) found that adding vitamins, minerals and other nutritional elements to the diets of prisoners &#x27;remarkably&#x27; reduced their antisocial behaviour.

HMP Aylesbury prison was back in the headlines in 2007 after it was revealed to have a higher rate of self-harm by inmates than any other Young Offenders Institution in England Following the introduction of the Prison Service&#x27;s ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody, and Teamwork) system the rate of self-harm has reduced significantly.

In December 2008, police officers and Prison Service &#x27;Tornado Teams&#x27; were called in to contain a disturbance at Aylesbury Prison, officially described as a &#x27;Concerted Indiscipline&#x27;. The incident lasted six hours, and involved a number of inmates who were taking part in Eid celebrations. A number of these were charged with &#x27;Prison Mutiny&#x27;.

In November 2009, a Prison Officer from HMYOI Aylesbury was jailed after it emerged that she had become pregnant after having a sexual relationship with an inmate. The Prison Officer was also convicted of smuggling three mobile phones into HMYOI Aylesbury.

==The prison today==
Aylesbury holds prisoners as cat C between the ages of 18 and 40. Accommodation comprises single cells in seven residential wings and one segregation unit.

There are full and part-time education programmes at the prison, which range from basic and key skills courses up to Art, French and Sociology at A Level and Physical Education. Vocational courses and work programmes include Construction, Painting and Decorating, Bricklaying, Motor Vehicle Mechanics, Industrial and General Cleaning, Laundry, Catering, Gardening and Waste management. Young Offenders also have opportunities to pursue award-based courses including the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award.

In February 2013 HMP Aylesbury appeared in an ITV documentary focusing on the lives of inmates and officers.

In July 2017 a serious violent incident took place involving many inmates and Prison Officers were injured some needing hospital treatment. In April 2018, a riot occurred, hospitalising four Prison Officers. Prisoners were frustrated because they spent the whole week locked in their cells and only had one chance a week to shower.

<doc id="810600" wikidata="Q741203" url="?curid=810600" title="Laser designator">
<text>A laser designator is a laser light source which is used to designate a target. Laser designators provide targeting for laser-guided bombs, missiles, or precision artillery munitions, such as the Paveway series of bombs, AGM-114 Hellfire, or the M712 Copperhead round, respectively.

When a target is marked by a designator, the beam is invisible and does not shine continuously. Instead, a series of coded laser pulses, also called PRF codes (pulse repetition frequency), are fired at the target. These signals bounce off the target into the sky, where they are detected by the seeker on the laser-guided munition, which steers itself towards the centre of the reflected signal. Unless the people being targeted possess laser detection equipment or can hear aircraft overhead, it is extremely difficult for them to determine whether they are being marked. Laser designators work best in clear atmospheric conditions. Cloud cover, rain or smoke can make reliable designation of targets difficult or impossible unless a simulation is accessible through available ground data.

==Deployment==
Laser designators may be mounted on aircraft, ground vehicles, naval vessels, or handheld. Depending on the wavelength of light used by the designator, the designation laser may or may not be visible to the personnel deploying it. This is the case with 1064 nm laser designators used by JTACs as that wavelength of light is difficult to see under standard Gen III/III+ night vision devices. Other imaging devices with &quot;see-spot&quot; capabilities to &quot;see&quot; the laser spot are often utilized to make sure the target is being correctly designated. These may include FLIR (forward looking infrared) thermal imagers which normally operate in the MWIR or LWIR spectrum but have a 1064 nm window in which they can see-spot the laser.

===Airborne===
The U.S. Air Force selected the Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) in 2004. It equipped multiple USAF platforms such as the F-16, F-15E, B-1, B-52, and A-10C. It also operates on multiple international fighter platforms. The U.S. Navy currently employ LITENING and ATFLIR targeting pods on a variety of strike aircraft. The Litening II is widely used by many other of the world&#x27;s air forces. The United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Air Force use the Litening III system and the French use the TALIOS (Targeting Long-range Identification Optronic System), Damocles and ATLIS II.

===Ground-based===

Many modern armed forces employ handheld laser designation systems. Examples include the AN/PEQ-1 SOFLAM of the United States, the Russian LPR series of handheld devices.

U.S. Air Force Joint Terminal Air Controllers and Marine Corps Forward Air Controllers typically employ a lightweight device, such as the AN/PED-1 Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR), permitting them to designate targets for Close Air Support aircraft flying overhead and in close proximity to friendly forces. While many designators are binocular-based and may utilize tripods, smaller handheld laser designators, like the B.E. Meyers &amp; Co. IZLID 1000P exist as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;an/peq-18 izlid&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Northrop Grumman&#x27;s LLDR, using an eye-safe laser wavelength, recognizes targets, finds the range to a target, and fixes target locations for laser-guided, GPS-guided, and conventional munitions. This lightweight, interoperable system uniquely provides range finding and targeting information to other digital battlefield systems allowing the system to provide targeting information for non-guided munitions, or when laser designation is unreliable due to battlefield conditions.

<text>Atlit Yam is a submerged ancient Neolithic village off the coast of Atlit, Israel. It has been carbon-dated as to be between 8,900 and 8,300 years old. Among the features of the site is a stone circle.

==History==

Atlit Yam provides the earliest known evidence for an agro-pastoral-marine subsistence system on the Levantine coast. The site of Atlit Yam has been carbon-dated to be between 8,900 and 8,300 years old (calibrated dates) and belongs to the final Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period. It is currently 8–12 m (25–40 ft) beneath sea level in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Bay of Atlit, at the mouth of the Oren river on the Carmel coast. It covers an area of ca. 40,000 square meters (10 acres).

Underwater excavations have uncovered remnants of rectangular houses and a well. The site was covered by the eustatic rise of sea levels after the end of the last Ice Age. It is assumed that the contemporary coastline was about 1 km (a half-mile) west of the present coast. Piles of fish ready for trade or storage have led scientists to conclude that the village was abandoned suddenly. An Italian study led by Maria Pareschi of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Pisa indicates that a volcanic collapse of the eastern flank of Mount Etna 8,500 years ago would likely have caused a 10-storey tsunami to engulf some Mediterranean coastal cities within hours. Some scientists point to the apparent abandonment of Atlit Yam around the same time as further evidence that indeed, such a tsunami did occur.

==Archaeological findings==

Submerged settlements and shipwrecks have been found on the Carmel coast since 1960, in the wake of large-scale sand quarrying. In 1984, marine archaeologist Ehud Galili spotted ancient remains while surveying the area for shipwrecks. Remains of rectangular houses and hearth-places have been found. Also found was a well that currently lies below sea-level, constructed of dry-stone walling, with a diameter of and a depth lower. The fill contained flints, artifacts of ground stone and bone, and animal bones in two separate layers. The upper layer contained partly articulated animal bones, which presumably were thrown in after the well went out of use. Other round structures at the site may also be wells. Galili believes that the water in the wells gradually became contaminated with seawater, forcing the inhabitants to abandon their homes.

A stone semicircle, containing seven megaliths, has been found. The stones have cup marks carved into them and are arranged around a freshwater spring, which suggests that they may have been used for a water ritual.

Ten flexed burials have been discovered, both inside the houses and in their vicinity. The skeletons of a woman and child, found in 2008, have revealed the earliest known cases of tuberculosis. Bone fish-hooks and piles of fish bones ready for trade or storage point to the importance of marine resources. The men are thought to have dived for seafood, as four skeletons with ear damage have been found, probably caused by diving in cold water. Anthropomorphic stone stelae have been found. The lithics include arrowheads, sickle-blades, and axes.

An excavation was mounted by the University of Haifa on October 1, 1987. A complete human burial, in an excellent state of preservation, was discovered under of water on October 4, 1987, with the skeleton oriented in a flexed position and laid on her right side. Subsequent carbon dating of plant material recovered from the burial placed the age of the site at 8000 +/−200 years.

Animal bones and plant remains also have been preserved. Animal bones come mainly from wild species. The plant remains include wild grape, poppy, and caraway seeds. Granary weevils indicate the presence of stored grain. Pollen analysis and the remains of marsh plants indicates the local presence of swamps.

The Homo I skeleton showed traits similar to Natufian populations, but had its own unique morphologic structure, which evidenced inbreeding in the community. The researchers emphasized that one skeleton is not an adequate sample on which to base conclusions. Inland and coastal groups present different types of economical and cultural adaptations to their environment.

===Radiocarbon dating ===
The settlement has been dated by three radiocarbon dates from submerged branches:

<text>Rosemary Follett (born 27 March 1948) is an Australian former politician who was the first Chief Minister of Australian Capital Territory, serving in 1989 and again between 1991 and 1995. She was the first woman to become head of government in an Australian state or territory.

==Early life==
Follett is the daughter of hansard writer Aubrey Follett, an Anglican, and his wife Judith (née Lusby), a teacher and Roman Catholic. Follett was born in Sydney in 1948, and moved with her family to Canberra in 1952. She took inspiration from female models of leadership in her own family from an early age — her mother was a teacher who had worked in naval intelligence with the Women&#x27;s Royal Australian Naval Service during World War II, while her aunt, Dr Gwen (Lusby) Fleming, had been a Major in the Australian Army Medical Corps, and aunt, Elizabeth Lusby was a school prioress in the Dominican Sisters.

Follett attended Canberra Catholic Girls&#x27; High School. She joined the Australian Public Service after leaving school, and travelled to Darwin and Sydney. She returned to Canberra with the public service, but was required to resign when she married. She studied stenography, and worked as a secretary for various politicians over the next ten years.

The 1975 dismissal of the Whitlam government inspired Follett to join the Ginninderra branch of the Labor Party, serving as its president between 1983 and 1984. In the meantime, she returned to university, studying arts and administration at the Canberra College of Advanced Education, and rejoined the public service. Prior to her election to the Assembly, Follett was an elected Member for Fraser in the representative advisory ACT House of Assembly, serving between 1985 and 1986; and became President of the ACT branch of Labor in 1987.

==Political career==
Preselected to lead Labor in the period before the 1989 inaugural general election, Follett was elected to the inaugural ACT Legislative Assembly and, on 11 May 1989, was elected by the Assembly as the inaugural Chief Minister. The first Assembly was characterised by a hung parliament and significant political instability.

Confidence was waning in the minority Follett Labor government. On 5 December 1989, Bernard Collaery, leader of the Residents Rally group (with three members in the Assembly) moved the following motion in the Assembly:

The vote was resolved in affirmative (10 votes to 7 votes), and Trevor Kaine was elected as the second Chief Minister. After another motion of no confidence was passed, this time against Kaine, Follett returned to office in 1991 and she led Labor to victory at the 1992 general election. Defeated by the Liberals under Kate Carnell at the 1995 general election.
Follett continued to lead the ALP until the following year 1996.
With a caucus of six members, Follett stood down as leader after she was tapped on the shoulder by Andrew Whitecross, the man who would become her successor and two of their colleagues.
Follett then resigned from the ACT Legislative Assembly in December 1996. Simon Corbell was elected to fill the casual vacancy. 

==Later career==
Since leaving politics, Follett has been Deputy Vice-chancellor at the University of Canberra; Chair of the Vocational Education and Training Authority; a member of the University of Canberra Council; member of the Sentence Administration Board and chair of the board of Senior Secondary School Studies. She led a trade mission to Japan and was instrumental in bringing about the ACT&#x27;s sister-city relationship with Nara and was a member of the Milk Authority of the ACT in 1996, and the Canberra Labor Club, Canberra Tradesmen&#x27;s Club and the Australian Fabian Society. Follett was the ACT&#x27;s Sex Discrimination Commissioner from 1996 to 2004.
On 14 April 2014, Follett received an honorary doctorate from the University of Canberra.

<text>Claude Coppens (born 23 December 1936, Schaerbeek, commune of Brussels) is a Belgian pianist and composer.

Coppens studied at the Royal Conservatory in Brussels with Marcel Maas and in Paris with Marguerite Long.

He is a Laureate of the Marguerite Long Competition (1955), the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition for Piano (1956), and the International Piano Competition in Rio de Janeiro (1957), where he performed the first piano concerto of Heitor Villa-Lobos, conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho, and for which he received the Villa-Lobos prize.

As an interpreter he is known for his faithfulness to the original intentions of the composer. John Cage&#x27;s music for prepared piano was executed by him after several exchanges with the composer about the exact way to do the &quot;preparation.&quot; He extensively studied Erik Satie&#x27;s music so that when he played the integral piano works of Satie in two consecutive sessions in 1995 (only abbreviating the &quot;Vexations&quot;), he revealed several more piano pieces by this composer, not known to the public until that day.

In 1960 Coppens obtained a doctorate in law from the Vrije Universiteit te Brussel (VUB).

<doc id="810622" wikidata="Q899371" url="?curid=810622" title="Brasil (mythical island)">
<text>Brasil, also known as Hy-Brasil and several other variants, is a phantom island said to lie in the Atlantic Ocean west of Ireland. Irish myths described it as cloaked in mist except for one day every seven years, when it becomes visible but still cannot be reached.

== Etymology ==

The etymology of the names &quot;Brasil&quot; and &quot;Hy-Brasil&quot; is unknown. Despite the similarity, the name of the country Brazil (Portuguese: ) has no connection to the mythical islands. The historian Walter Scaife remarked in 1890 that the toponym had something of a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp character, &quot;for on various maps it may be seen designating a great Antarctic continent, extending to the South Pole, or a small island near the Arctic Circle; or it may be as far west as the southern part of South America or as far east as the vicinity of the coast of Ireland...&quot; The form of the name being &quot;almost as various as the positions in which it is found...&quot; and listing thirteen different variations thereof.

It is synonymous with the Medieval Latin &quot;brasile&quot;, the term for a dye that enjoyed great popularity as a trading commodity in the twelfth century throughout Western Europe. It has been speculated that the widespread appearance of the name served as a locational marker for sources of the dye, primarily for sailors from the Republic of Genoa where most of the maps originate.

In Irish tradition it is said to come from the Irish (meaning &#x27;descendants/clan of Bresail&#x27;), a minor Gaelic clan of northeastern Ireland, or less frequently from the Old Irish &#x27;island&#x27; + &#x27;beauty, worth; great, mighty&#x27;.

== Appearance on maps ==

Nautical charts identified an island called &quot;Bracile&quot; west of Ireland in the Atlantic Ocean in a portolan chart by Angelino Dulcert circa 1325, the Rex Tholomeus portolan chart circa 1360 and the Catalan Atlas circa 1375.

Later it appeared as &quot;Insula de Brasil&quot; in the Venetian map of Andrea Bianco (1436), attached to one of the larger islands of a group of islands in the Atlantic. This was identified for a time with the modern island of Terceira in the Azores, where a volcanic mount at the bay of its main town, Angra do Heroismo, is still named Monte Brasil. A Catalan chart of about 1480 labels two islands &quot;Illa de brasil&quot;, one to the south west of Ireland and one south of &quot;Illa verde&quot; or Greenland.

In 1526, Roger Barlow translated Martín Fernández de Enciso&#x27;s &quot;Suma de Geographia&quot; into English and included the following description:

On maps the island was shown as being circular, often with a central strait or river running east–west across its diameter. Despite the failure of attempts to find it, this appeared regularly on maps lying south west of Galway Bay until 1865, by which time it was called &quot;Brasil Rock.&quot;

Today Porcupine Bank appears on maps at roughly the same location.

=== Map gallery ===
== Searches for the island ==
Expeditions left Bristol in 1480 and 1481 to search for the island; and a letter written by Pedro de Ayala, shortly after the return of John Cabot (from his expedition in 1497), reports that land found by Cabot had been &quot;discovered in the past by the men from Bristol who found Brasil&quot;.

In 1674, a Captain John Nisbet claimed to have seen the island when on a journey from France to Ireland, stating that the island was inhabited by large black rabbits and a magician who lived alone in a stone castle, yet the character and the story were a literary invention by Irish author Richard Head. Roderick O&#x27;Flaherty in &quot;A Chorographical Description of West or H-Iar Connaught&quot; (1684) tells us &quot;There is now living, Morogh O&#x27;Ley (), who imagines he was personally on O&#x27;Brasil for two days, and saw out of it the Aran Islands, Golamhead [by Lettermullen], Irrosbeghill, and other places of the west continent he was acquainted with.&quot;

Hy-Brasil has also been identified with Porcupine Bank, a shoal in the Atlantic Ocean about west of Ireland and discovered in 1862. As early as 1870, a paper was read to the Geological Society of Ireland suggesting this identification. The suggestion has since appeared more than once, e.g., in an 1883 edition of &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Irish poet Gerald Griffin wrote about Hy-Brasil in the early nineteenth century.

Mary Burke&#x27;s short story uses the myth as an allegory of the breach caused by the Northern Irish Troubles. Mary Burke, “Hy-Brasil” in &quot;The Faber Best New Irish Short Stories, 2004-5&quot; Ed. David Marcus. London: Faber &amp; Faber, 2005, 101–05.

In &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot;, part of Mary Stewart&#x27;s Merlin Trilogy, several characters believe (incorrectly) that the wizard Merlin has hidden the young Prince Arthur on Hy-Brasil.
In the 1989 film comedy film &quot;Erik the Viking&quot;, Hy-Brasil is the location of the Horn Resounding, said to allow mortals to enter Asgard and return home safely. In the film it is said that if blood should ever be spilled on its shores the land would sink beneath the waves.

In the 2009 book &quot;Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization&quot;, Graham Hancock attributed the appearance of Hy-Brasil on so many maps as evidence of a lost corpus of pre-Ptolemaic maps that showed evidence of substantial earth changes, including sunken islands.

<text>MOD is a computer file format used primarily to represent music, and was the first module file format. MOD files use the “.MOD” file extension, except on the Amiga which doesn&#x27;t rely on filename extensions; instead, it reads a file&#x27;s header to determine filetype. A MOD file contains a set of &quot;instruments&quot; in the form of samples, a number of &quot;patterns&quot; indicating how and when the samples are to be played, and a list of what patterns to play in what order.

== History ==

The first version of the format was created by Karsten Obarski for use in the Ultimate Soundtracker, tracker software released for the Amiga computer in 1987. The format has since been supported by hundreds of playback programs and dozens of other trackers.

The original version of the MOD format featured four channels of simultaneous audio playback, corresponding to the capabilities of the original Amiga chipset, and up to 15 instruments.

Later variations of the format have extended this to up to 32 channels and 31 instruments.

The format was designed to be directly playable on the Amiga without additional processing: for example, samples are stored in 8-bit PCM format ready to be played on the Amiga DACs, and pattern data is not packed. Playback required very little CPU time on an Amiga, and many games used MOD files for their background music.

A common misconception is that the magic number &quot;M.K.&quot; in the 0x438 offset of MOD files are the initials of Mahoney and Kaktus, two prominent Amiga demomakers at the time, who played an important part in the popularity of the format. They in fact stand for the initials of Michael Kleps a.k.a. Unknown / DOC, another developer of the format.

After the Amiga&#x27;s production ceased, the MOD format has had continued popularity in the Demoscene and as background music for independent video games and Chiptunes. It is not uncommon to hear MOD music in keygens either.

== Format overview ==
A pattern is typically represented in a sequencer user interface as a table with one column per channel, thus having four columns – one for each Amiga hardware channel. Each column has 64 rows.

A cell in the table can cause one of several actions to happen on its column&#x27;s channel when its row&#x27;s time is reached:
* Start an instrument playing a new note in this channel at a given volume, possibly with a special effect applied on it
* Change the volume or special effect being applied to the current note
* Change pattern flow; jump to a specific song or pattern position or loop inside a pattern
* Do nothing; any existing note playing in this channel will continue to play

An instrument is a single sample along with an optional indication of which portion of the sample can be repeated to hold a sustained note.

== Timing ==
In the original MOD file the minimum time frame was 0.02 seconds, or a &quot;vertical blanking&quot; (VSync) interval, because the original software used the VSync timing of the monitor running at 50 Hz (for PAL) or 60 Hz (for NTSC) for timing.

The rate at which pattern data is played is defined by a &quot;speed setting&quot;. Each row in the pattern data lasts one vertical blanking (or 0.02 seconds) times the current speed setting. The speed setting varied from 1 to 255.
In later versions of the format, the vertical blanking was replaced with an adjustable time period staying in the range [0.01, 0.078] seconds. The old speed setting command was replaced with a new one that was used to change both the old speed setting and the new adjustable time period. Unfortunately, some of the old functionality was broken, because the new speed setting command had an identical code value to the old command. Values in the range [1, 31] were interpreted as the old speed settings, but other values were regarded as modifications to the adjustable time period. Hence, values in the range [32, 255] used in some old songs broke in new versions of the player.

Further information on the MOD format can be found at the alt.binaries.sounds.mods FAQ.

== Other formats that use the MOD extension ==

MOD is the file extension for several other applications:

* The video file format used on many digital camcorders, such as the JVC Everio, the Canon FS100 and the Panasonic D-Snap SD-card camcorders.
* Game modules in Neverwinter Nights.
* AMPL model files.
* Old phpBB modification templates.
* Module files in Femap
* The extension for the binary variant of the Wavefront .obj format.
* The extension for some games using the Vassal game engine.
* The extension for Fortran module files.
* The extension for legacy Visual Basic module files, for versions before the release of Visual Basic .NET.
* The extension for Go module files, used for package versioning.
* Module for ABB Robotics IRC5 and S4 robot controllers. Contains robotic motion programs written in the language RAPID.
* Lanner WITNESS simulation software model files
* Paradox Development Studio uses a &quot;.MOD&quot; format for user-created modifications of their games.
* DND adventure modules for Fantasy Grounds, a virtual tabletop application.
* GNU GRUB boot modules (when found in /boot)

<text>Bangpūtys or “bryanē is the name of a masculine deity in Lithuanian mythology. Basing on very scanty sources, some mythologists have reconstructed him as a god of sea and storm. According to the reconstructions, he is austere and unrelenting. He has a beard, wings and two faces. He is commonly portrayed as having a fish in his left hand, a utensil in his right hand, and a rooster on the head.

His sons are the gods of wind: Rytys, Pietys, Šiaurys and Vakaris (easterly, southern, northern and westerly).

Bangpūtys is considered a very vindictive god, for example, one story talks of how Auštaras (son of Aušrinė and Mėnuo, the other god of easterly wind) was swimming in the sea and made a storm. Bangpūtys wanted to drown him.

Sometimes Bangpūtys is referred to as associating with Vėjopatis.
