Marsaxlokk won the Maltese Premier League title for the first time in their history, after finishing as league champions for the 2006–07 season. Marsaxlokk has its headquarters at Triq il-Kavalleriza, Mxlokk redoubt.

==History==

===Early years (1949–1954)===
The first team to Marsaxlokk represented in competitions MFA were Beland City back in 1944. Although the team was formed within the Zejtun, they decided to represent to Marsaxlokk after the MFA adopted the scheme of representation of the district.

After World War II, a number of teams could be formed and in 1949 eventually team Marsaxlokk FC was formed. Marsaxlokk White Stars took part in the Amateur Cup and in 1955 they applied to take part in competitions organized by the MFA.

The association held a series of play-offs to fill the gap that was left team Naxxar Lions in the Third Division. Nevertheless, after two years, the team decided to withdraw from the competitions MFA.

In 1965, Marsaxlokk FC again applied to participate in the competitions of the MFA. The application was accepted. In season between 1965 and 1966, they took part in the league of the Third Division, finished in third place and reached the final of the Knock Out. The season after, Marsaxlokk FC finished runner-up in both the league and in the Knock Out thereby gained promotion for the first time. But season after (1970–71) they were again relegated. The promotion to the second division again achieved the following season (1973–74). After an excellent season in the league, where they maintained a record without defeat, they lost against in Siggiewi Championship decider. They remained in the Second Division until the 1977–78 season when they were relegated.

After eight years in the Third Division, Marsaxlokk won Section B in 1985–86 to then been promoted to the Second Division. The season after, they failed to be promoted so fell again in the Third Division. However, in the 1991–92 season, they won the Third Division Section A with only one loss in Championship decider on penalties against Zejtun Corinthians.

Then, back in the Second Division, Marsaxlokk have set themselves until finally won the Second Division in 1999–2000, to eventually been promoted to First Division. In 2002–2003 season, Marsaxlokk were promoted for the first time in the Premier League having been crowned champions of the First Division Rothmans.

Then after two years in the Maltese Premier League, for the first time, Marsaxlokk wrote in their history the final of the FA Trophy. Although lost against champions Sliema Wanderers c, are qualified for the first round of UEFA Cup qualification where finally have met with NK Primorje of Slovenia.

===Entering the League (1955–1957)===
The club applied for a place in the Malta Football Association competitions in 1955. The Malta Football Association organised a series of play-offs to fill a vacancy left by Naxxar Lions in the Maltese Third Division.

Marsaxlokk went on to win the play-offs and secure a place in the Maltese Third Division, but following a lack of interest in the club, they opted out of Malta Football Association after just two years.

===Re-entering the League (1965–1978)===
In 1965, Marsaxlokk again applied to take part in the Malta Football Association competitions and their application was accepted. Marsaxlokk took part in the Maltese Third Division 1965/66, finishing in third place and reaching the final of the Knock-Out. The following season, the Southseasiders finished as runners-up in both the Maltese Third Division and again reached the knock-out.

They managed to win promotion to the Maltese Second Division for the first time in their history during the 1970/71 season, but were relegated the following season. The club again achieved promotion to Maltese Second Division in 1973/74, following an excellent league campaign where they held an unbeaten record, and only lost to Siggiewi in the championship decider.

Marsaxlokk retained their Maltese Second Division status until for five seasons, until 1977/78 when they returned to the Maltese Third Division following yet another relegation.

===Between the Maltese Third Division and the Maltese Second Division (1978–1992)===
The club remained in the Maltese Third Division for eight years, before winning Section B in 1985/86 and as a result gained promotion back to Maltese Second Division. The promotion didn&#x27;t last long and the club were relegated back to the Maltese Third Division the following season.

Some six seasons later Marsaxlokk found themselves back in the Maltese Second Division after winning the Maltese Third Division Section A, and only failed to clinch the championship decider to the Zejtun Corinthians on penalties.

===Promotion to the Maltese First Division (1992–2000)===
Marsaxlokk established themselves as a Maltese Second Division side for nearly a decade, until they finally won the Maltese Second Division for the first time in the history in 1999–2000, and won promotion to the Maltese First Division.

===Promotion to the Maltese Premier League (2000–02)===
With the club seemingly doing well, they spent just two seasons in the Maltese First Division.

Marsaxlokk won the Maltese First Division during the 2001–02 season, and were promoted as champions to the Maltese Premier League, where the club would appear for the first time in their history.

===Entering Europe (2003–05)===
After two years in the Maltese Premier League, the Southseasiders managed to reach the final of the Maltese Cup in 2004; this was the first time the club had ever reached the final, and despite the club losing to the champions, the Sliema Wanderers.

Despite the fact that Marsaxlokk had lost in the final of the Maltese Cup, they qualified for the first qualifying round of the UEFA Cup where they met NK Primorje of Slovenia, losing 1–0 at home in the first leg and 2–0 in Slovenia in the return leg.

It was reported on 6 January 2003 that the ambitious Maltese club had made an attempt to sign former England player Paul Gascoigne, but the club failed in any attempt, despite a reported salary of £12,500 a month, which would have been a record salary in Malta had Gascoigne agreed to the terms.
During the January transfer window of 2003/04, the club strengthened the squad further, with the signings of highly rated young Maltese midfield duo André Schembri from Hibernians and Cleavon Frendo from Pietà Hotspurs.

Marsaxlokk were showing real promise by this stage and were looking ready to challenge the likes of the Sliema Wanderers, Valletta and Birkirkara to major honours, and yet again signalled they were a side improving. However, the side finished in fifth place for the 2004–05 season, a place lower than their highest-ever league finish of fourth the season prior.

===(2005–06) season===
In the 2005–06 season, Marsaxlokk made some very interesting signings: Brazil-born striker Wendell Gomes and Portuguese ex-Boavista defender Nuno Gomes joined the club, along with Malta internationals, defender Carlo Mamo from the Sliema Wanderers and Jamie Pace from Valletta.

The club also pulled off the biggest transfer in their history on 6 August 2005, when they acquired the services of former English Premier League and former Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest player Chris Bart-Williams.

Despite all the hype surrounding Bart-Williams&#x27; move to Malta, he did not live up to the billing and the signing resulted in one of the biggest flops the club had ever experienced. Bart-Williams was soon on his way back home only managing eight appearances before having his three-year contract cancelled after only two months of signing it.

The club enjoyed a successful season and finished in the highest league position in their history, when they grabbed a third-place finish in the Maltese Premier League. The club also managed to qualify for the first round of the UEFA Intertoto Cup where they would meet the Bosnia and Herzegovina side HŠK Zrinjski Mostar; sadly for Marsaxlokk their European adventure didn&#x27;t last for long as they were knocked out 4–1 over the two legs.

===Winning the Maltese Premier League (2006–07) season===
The following season Marsaxlokk made some very impressive signings, acquiring the services of Maltese internationals, goalkeeper Justin Haber, defender Luke Dimech, midfielder Peter Pullicino and striker Daniel Bogdanovic along with Nigerian midfielder Haruna Doda.

With the club finishing in third position the previousseason, and with the list of impressive signings that had been made by manager Brian Talbot, the Marsaxlokk fans had every reason to be in an optimistic mood. With the club doing well in the league the January transfer window arrived. The club swapped André Rocha da Silva for Udo Nwoko with Hibernians, both on loan deals until the end of the season. Shaun Bajada also left the club on loan until the end of the season, joining Msida Saint-Joseph. The team again impressed during the league season, and were confirmed as champions with one game remaining. They even achieved a 4–1 defeat of the second-placed Sliema Wanderers on the penultimate day of the season with Cleavon Frendo, Jamie Pace, André Schembri and Daniel Bogdanovic all finding the net on the day.

Another award went back to Marsaxlokk when Bogdanovic finished as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer with 31 goals in 28 appearances, and ended the season one goal short of Danilo Doncic&#x27;s Maltese record of 32 goals in a season, set while playing for Valletta during the 2001–02 season.

===2007–08 season===
Marsaxlokk started the 2007–08 season with more worries than the previous and many believe that Marsaxlokk will struggle to emulate the success of the 2006–07 season with the loss of some vital players such as Luke Dimech, Justin Haber, Daniel Bogdanovic all leaving, and André Schembri going on a season-long loan to German club Eintracht Braunschweig. The club also decided against renewing the contracts of duo Samir Garci and Haruna Doda. The club did however sign Englishman Daniel Webb following his release from Yeovil Town.

Following the team&#x27;s triumph the previous season they were entered into the UEFA Champions League qualifying stages. Following so many player departures the club struggled to list a full 16 players in their debut match against FK Sarajevo, where the club only managed to list 13 players, and due to the club&#x27;s lack of resources they lost the tie 9–1 on (agg).

Daniel Webb lasted just one game with the club, and returned to his native England to team up with AFC Wimbledon. The team have so far signed Maltese international William Camenzuli, along with the Brazilian trio of Renato Conceição, André Rocha da Silva and the re-signing of Wendell Gomes. The team also snapped up Mark Barbara on a season-long loan from Valletta.

The transfer window re-opened on 1 January 2008 with the club in seventh place after 12 games, taking a pretty bad beating from the newly promoted Ħamrun Spartans on 7 December 2007, where they were beaten 7–3. On the transfer front the club released the Brazilian duo of Wendell Gomes and André Rocha da Silva by mutual consent (with the latter joining the Sliema Wanderers); this meant that two of the three foreigners at the club had now left, paving the way for two new foreigners to join the club during the January transfer period.

Marsaxlokk made their first signing of the January transfer window, when they acquired the services of Argentine striker Julio Alcorsé on loan from fellow Premier League side Hibernians. Marsaxlokk followed up the signing of Julio Alcorsé on 23 January, with Montenegro born striker Aleksandar Madžar, who joined on a free following his release from Sliema Wanderers.

Things took a turn for the better with the aforementioned changes within the striking department and it was the names of Julio Alcorsé and Aleksandar Madžar that would appear on the scoresheet regularly. Following the players&#x27; good form in front of the goal, Julio Alcorsé finished the season third in the top goalscoring charts with 12 goals and Aleksandar Madžar finished seventh with 10 goals to his name.Marsaxlokk finally managed to clinch a second-place finish in the table, and grabbed a place in next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup first qualifying round, a rather impressive achievement given the number of departures the team had to overcome in the season. The team rounded off the season with a fantastic 4–0 victory over newly crowned champions Valletta, with goals for the day coming from Jamie Pace, Stephen Wellman (x2) and Aleksandar Madžar.

===2008–09 season===
Following the club&#x27;s second-place finish during the 2007/08 season, they were seeded for the first qualifying round of the UEFA Cup. The draw was made on 1 July 2008, in which Marsaxlokk were drawn against Croatian outfit Slaven Belupo, who also finished second in their respective league last season.

On the transfer front long serving defender Charlo Magro announced his retirement, after five seasons with the club. André Schembri completed a season long loan at German outfit Eintracht Braunschweig, and will return to Germany for the current season, after joining Carl Zeiss Jena on another season long loan. Also departing are the influential midfield duo of Jamie Pace and Cleavon Frendo, who both signed with league champions Valletta, along with Montenegro striker Aleksandar Madžar who wasn&#x27;t retained, and later went on to join Floriana. Young midfielder Gordon Mizzi will spend the season on loan with Maltese Third Division side Gzira United, in order to gain some valuable first team experience.

Joining the club was Valletta goalkeeper Saviour Darmanin, Replacing Aleksandar Madžar as the club&#x27;s third foreign player is Marcelo Pereira, who played the previous season for relegated Mqabba, and finished in second place in the league&#x27;s goalscoring charts, with an impressive 14 goals. Last season&#x27;s top goalscorer Julio Alcorsé and fellow striker Mark Barbara had their loan moves from Hibernians and Valletta respectively, extended for a further season.

On 8 July 2008, Marsaxlokk strengthened their squad further with the signings of midfielder Christian Cassar, who joined on a five-year contract from Floriana and defender Clive Brincat from St. George&#x27;s, although the latter had spent last season on loan with Msida Saint-Joseph. The club also confirmed the signing of Malta vice captain and defender Brian Said from Sliema Wanderers along with fellow defender Arnold Buttigieg from St. Patrick the following day. However, goalkeeper Reuben Gauci and defender Shawn Tellus departed, both players signed season long loan deals with newly promoted side Qormi. On 20 August 2008, Marsaxlokk rounded up their summer of new signings, with the capture of Malta international Claude Mattocks, who had fallen out of favour with Valletta.

Marsaxlokk started the season on 28 August 2008 with an unimpressive draw against newly promoted Qormi, with Julio Alcorsé scoring a very late equaliser to cancel out an earlier goal Ivan to force a 1–1 draw.

Following a 2–0 defeat by holders Valletta, the club recorded their first win coming from two goals behind to beat Ħamrun Spartans 4–2, with goals from Malcolm Licari, Brian Said, Marcelo Pereira and Claude Mattocks.

Following a list of disappointing results, Marsaxlokk appointed Msida Saint-Joseph manager Patrick Curmi as the club&#x27;s new manager on 18 December 2008, with previous manager Brian Talbot moving upstairs as the club&#x27;s technical director.

Patrick Curmi&#x27;s reign began with an unfortunate 1–0 defeat to Valletta, with former Marsaxlokk player Cleavon Frendo scoring the only goal, Curmi did taste his first victory in his fourth game with a 2–1 win over Floriana.

With Marsaxlokk still running the risk of finishing 7th and playing in the relegation pool, their fate would be sealed on the last day of the first phase with a game against Curmi&#x27;s old club Msida Saint-Joseph. A Marsaxlokk win would mean the clubs would swap places in the league and condemn Msida Saint-Joseph to a place in the relegation pool. Patrick Curmi used his knowledge of his old club to mastermind a 2–1 win and claim the final place in the championship pool.

Marsaxlokk season did however have a sour note after an ongoing investigation into an allegation of bribery against player Claude Mattocks and team manager Peter Hartshorne. On 24 March 2009, both were convicted of bribery and sentenced to four months jail suspended for a year and fined €500. Both parties had pleaded guilty to trying to bribe Msida Saint-Joseph goalkeeper Matthew Camilleri in a fixture on 23 November 2008, the game ended 1–1. Following the verdict Claude Mattocks and Peter Hartshorne were both relieved of their duties with the club. Marsaxlokk concluded their season in impressive style, when despite a 2–1 defeat to Floriana the club managed a fourth-place finish.

===2009–10 season===
The Club still claiming its innocence, pursued its campaign in the First Division with fierce competition and at a heavy financial cost eventually winning the double honors of that season and claimed its Premier place once again. During this time the Club started restructuring its facilities that of a new training ground completed with dressing rooms and other needy facilities.

===2010–14 seasons ===

===2015–16 season===

===2016–17 season===
After being promoted as Champions from the 3rd Division to the 2nd Division, the Club managed to end the season positively by remaining in the 2nd Division. Marsaxlokk FC Youth Team (U19&#x27;s) were crowned Champions of Section E.

===2017–18 season===
The Club ended the season positively by remaining in the 2nd Division. Marsaxlokk FC Youth Team (U19&#x27;s) remained in Section D.

=== 2018–19 season===

<text>Athletic Club Omonia Nicosia (; &quot;Athlitikós Sýllogos Omónoia Lefkosías&quot;), commonly known as Omonia Nicosia, or simply Omonia (also transliterated as Omonoia), is a Cypriot professional multi-sport club, established on 4 June 1948 in Nicosia. It is best known for its football department, which has participated in the Cypriot First Division since 1953. On 14 June 2018, the football department of AC Omonia became a professional for-profit football company, and is since known as Omonia FC.

Omonia is one of Cyprus&#x27; most successful football clubs, having won 21 National Championships, 16 Cups, and a record 17 Super Cups. Omonia has won five doubles and a record three domestic trebles, and is one of three Cypriot clubs to never have been relegated to the second division. Omonia also holds an outstanding record of 14 championships in two decades (between 1970 and 1989), a record of being either champion or runner-up 14 times in a row in the championship (between 1973 and 1986), and the record of having won the Cypriot Cup four times in a row (between 1980 and 1983).

AC Omonia also operates departments in basketball, volleyball, futsal, cycling, runners, women&#x27;s football and women&#x27;s volleyball.

==History==

=== Creation and early years (1948–1953) ===
On 23 May 1948, the governing board of APOEL football club sent a telegram to the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics (Greek: Σ.Ε.Γ.Α.Σ.), with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition. In its telegram, the board stated its wish for what it described as the &quot;communist mutiny&quot; to be ended. Club players considering this action as a specifically political comment on the Greek Civil War distanced themselves from the board and were duly expelled from APOEL. On 4 June 1948, Dr. Mattheos Papapetrou organized a meeting in Nicosia that led to the creation of Omonia. Many players expelled from APOEL were present at the meeting and joined the new club. Along with other left-wing teams such as Nea Salamina, Alki Larnaca and Orfeas Nicosia, Omonia helped create the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation in December 1948. Omonia took part in the CAFF league until 1953, having won four out of five played championships and five out of five played cups. Omonia was then accepted by the Cyprus Football Association to participate in the Cypriot First Division.

===Beginnings in the Cypriot First Division (1953–1969)===
After joining the Cypriot First Division in 1953, Omonia only placed seventh out of nine teams in the 1953–54 season, barely avoiding relegation. During that decade, the club&#x27;s best placing came during the 1956–57 season when the club finished in the third position.

The team would make its closest push for the title during the 1959–60 season after finishing second, one point behind Anorthosis Famagusta. The following year, after seven seasons in the First Division, the club would win its first title in 1960–61 season. Omonia, in that season, would score 91 goals in 24 matches on their way to their first ever Cyprus First Division title. Omonia won their second title during the 1965–66 season.

===Golden era (1970s–1980s)===
Omonia won its first trophies of the decade in 1972, when the club won both the league and the cup. Led by a young Sotiris Kaiafas, Omonia won seven league titles in the 1970s, six of them were consecutive (1974–1979). At the end of the decade, Omonia had a total of nine championship titles and three cups. At the end of the 1979 season, Omonia trailed its arch-rival APOEL by two championships. In 1976, Sotiris Kaiafas would go on and win the European Golden Shoe for his single-season 39-goal performance. In 2003, he was awarded the UEFA Jubilee Awards for the Best Cypriot Footballer of the 20th century.

The 1980s was a successful decade for the club as it won an additional seven Cypriot League Championship titles including another five consecutive in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, and in 1987 and in 1989. As the 1980s came to an end, Omonia had won 14 Cypriot championship titles, becoming the most successful team on the island at the time.

===General decline (1990s)===
The 1990s would prove to be less successful than the previous two decades. During this time, Omonia only mustered one Cypriot League title during the 1992–93 season. It would be eight years before Omonia would see its next title. In 1997, Omonia signed the German Rainer Rauffmann, who would later become the second top goalscorer ever for the club. With the help of other Omonia great and then captain, Costas Malekkos, and a young Costas Kaiafas (the son of Sotiris Kaiafas), Rauffmann would become top scorer of the Cypriot First Division in 1997–98, 1998–99, 1999–00 and 2000–01 seasons and led Omonia to two titles.

===Revival (2000s)===
After a disappointing eight seasons, the 2000s decade began with a trophy. Omonia celebrated its 18th Cypriot league championship title in 2001. Now captained by Costas Kaiafas, Omonia would win its 19th Cypriot League Championship again in 2003. Since 2003, however, the team would stumble and be without a title for the next several years. After numerous seasons of poor signings and underachieving, Omonia&#x27;s reigns would be taken over by new chairman and team president, Miltiadis Neophytou in 2008.
The team would soon be put back on track starting in 2006, beginning with the signing of Cyprus international goalkeeper Antonis Georgallides. Omonia would continue its star-studded signings by acquiring Cypriot stars that had been playing abroad, such as Elias Charalambous and Stathis Aloneftis. Omonia would then make headlines with the shocking signing of all-time leading scorer for Cyprus, Michalis Konstantinou. In 2009, Omonia would also sign another Cypriot star, Konstantinos Makrides. En route, Omonia would also acquire young Cypriot hopefuls, 21-year-old Dimitris Christofi and 20-year-old Georgios Efrem. Efrem, who had been playing on the youth team of Arsenal and later Scottish side Rangers, would be the final piece to the puzzle needed to win its 20th Cypriot league championship. After putting the proper pieces in place, Omonia did just that. During the 2009–10 season, led by the new captain, Elias Charalambous, Omonia would not lose a single derby, including play-off matches against APOEL, Anorthosis and Apollon.

Head coach Takis Lemonis left the club after disappointing results and Dušan Bajević became the new coach in October 2010, but was fired in April 2011. He was replaced by Neophytos Larkou. Omonia would not be able to repeat as Champion during the 2010–11 regular season, and instead had to settle with finishing second, despite the addition of yet another young Cypriot rising star, Andreas Avraam. The club, however, was able to finish the season on a positive note: under Larkou, Omonia defeated Apollon Limassol in the Cypriot Cup final to win their 13th cup title.

The following season, Omonia won their 14th cup starring André Alves, who scored the winning goal against AEL Limassol in the final. Under the guidance of newly appointed director of football Nickolas Danskalou, Omonia finished third in the league, all but assuring they would qualify for the second round of the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.

===Financial crisis (2012–2018)===
Head coach Neophytos Larkou left the club in September 2012 and Toni Savevski was then appointed as coach. The team began the season with a great win but found its second success after several games. A disappointing first round proved enough to exclude the club from contesting for the championship or the cup. The team managed better results in the second round, finishing the season in third place. Thousands of fans answered the president&#x27;s call to donate as much as they could and the financial issues of the club improved. Omonia was knocked out in the semi-finals of the cup by AEL Limassol.

In 2013, Omonia began the new season with Savevski as manager, but he was sacked halfway beside positive results. Miguel Ángel Lotina was hired as the replacement, but was sacked just 37 days later. Kostas Kaiafas, ex-player was then appointed as the new coach. The club&#x27;s financial difficulties returned despite the massive fundraiser organized the previous season. Omonia finished fifth in the league, making it its worst season in 56 years.

In August 2014, Omonia was knocked out of the Europa League by Dynamo Moscow, in the play-off round. The club issued a complaint to UEFA regarding the refereeing of the match by Alexandru Tudor. In early September, the club stopped supplying the fans&#x27; group Gate 9 with tickets resulting in the group&#x27;s abstention from matches. Two weeks later, after a meeting between the president and the coach, it was decided that tickets were to be supplied again to Gate 9. Omonia finished fourth in the league. The team was eliminated from the Cypriot Cup in the semi-finals by APOEL.

The team ended the 2015–16 campaign in 4th place. During this season, Omonia reached the final of the Cypriot Cup but lost to Apollon Limassol. The 2016–17 season saw the club finish 5th. This meant that for the first time in 15 years the club had failed to qualify for European football. Following a general assembly at the end of the season, Antonis Tzionis was elected as the new club president. While the 2017–18 campaign began with high expectations, Omonia finished the season in 6th place. This season was the worst in the club&#x27;s history, in terms of defeats and goals conceded. Despite this, the club sold a total of 95,222 tickets during the season, more than any other team in the league.

===Papastavrou era (2018–present)===
The decline of the club&#x27;s football department and the financial difficulties it faced convinced many that a change in the way the club was being run was needed. In May 2018, a general assembly was called and members voted to hand the football department over to Stavros Papastavrou, an American-based Cypriot businessman. He has stated that he will provide funds for the development of the club&#x27;s academies and training grounds, and that the potential creation of a new stadium will be considered. The agreement, initially set for 10 years, was extended indefinitely in 2023. In the club&#x27;s first season under Papastavrou&#x27;s ownership, Omonia finished the 2018–19 campaign in 6th place. Manager Yannis Anastasiou was replaced by Henning Berg in June 2019.

The 2019–20 Cypriot season was abandoned in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of its abandonment, Omonia was tied with Anorthosis Famagusta on points, but was ranked first due to a better head-to-head record and thus qualified for the first qualifying round of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League.

The following season, a penalty shootout win over Red Star Belgrade meant that the club had qualified for the group stage of a European Competition for the first time in its history. Omonia finished fourth in Group E of the 2020–21 Europa League. In the home game against PSV Eindhoven, Omonia captain Jordi Gómez scored from a distance of 56 metres, breaking the record for the furthest distance ever for a goal scored in the Europa League. In May 2021, Omonia ended the season by winning the Cypriot League for the 21st time, and for the first time since 2010.

In the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons, the team struggled in the domestic league, however, managerial changes in the second half of each season (Neil Lennon in 2021–22 and Sofronis Avgousti in 2022–23) were able to inspire back-to-back Cup wins. At the European level, Omonia participated in the group stages of the 2021–22 Conference League and the 2022–23 Europa League, in which they put really close fights against the likes of Manchester United and Real Sociedad.

A turbulent 2023–24 campaign, which included the hiring and firing of a sporting director and the sacking of two coaches, concluded without domestic or European success for Omonia. Giannis Anastasiou and Valdas Dambrauskas were appointed as football advisor and head coach ahead of the 2024–25 season, respectively. Valdas Dambrauskas left the club in November 2024. Giannis Anastasiou has been interim coach until the end of the season. 

== Club identity and media ==

=== Name ===
&quot;Omonia&quot; (Ομόνοια) is the Greek language word for harmony, unity, or concord.

=== Colours and badge ===
Omonia&#x27;s club colours are green and white. The green color indicates hope while white indicates happiness.

Omonia&#x27;s badge has a green shamrock in a white circle.

Omonia tends to use a red alternative kit.

=== Anthem ===
Omonia&#x27;s official anthem was written by Costas Melides in 1971, and recorded by Giannis Avraamides in 1972, in Athens. The lyrics of the anthem reference Omonia&#x27;s competitive spirit (&quot;Lions in defense, cannons in attack&quot;, ), the club&#x27;s left-wing roots (&quot;the people&#x27;s team&quot;, ), and the loyalty of the team&#x27;s supporters, regardless of its results (&quot;In every match, thousands of your loyal fans&quot;, ).

=== Media presence ===
OMONOIA TV is the club&#x27;s official television channel, established in 2024 as the first dedicated sports club TV channel in Cyprus. It provides various club-related content, including live broadcasts of the football team&#x27;s friendly matches, replays of past matches, exclusive interviews, documentaries and news bulletins. OMONOIA TV is not be confused with OFC TV, the football team&#x27;s official YouTube channel. OFC TV is the most subscribed YouTube channel for a sports team in Cyprus, and features content such as match highlights, training sessions, and press conferences.

==Stadium==

Since 23 October 1999, Omonia has been using the 22,859-seat New GSP Stadium, the largest stadium in Cyprus. They share and rent the stadium with local rival APOEL.

Initially, the team played at the Goal Stadium from 1948 to 1953. After joining the Cyprus Football Association, Omonia moved to the old GSP Stadium in 1953, and then to the Makario Stadium in 1978, where they played until 1999.

=== Plans for construction of a privately owned stadium ===
The club had initiated the creation of a stadium in Mia Milia in 1971, but plans were abandoned after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. In 2003, the club purchased a piece of land in Nicosia with the aim of building a stadium, however the property was given to the Bank of Cyprus due to debts of the owner company.

In August 2024, having previously spoken about his intention to do so, Omonia FC owner Stavros Papastavrou announced that a new privately owned stadium will be built for the club. The stadium will be located in Tseri, it will have a capacity of 16,000 seats, is expected to be ready for use in the 2028–29 season and along with surrounding premises will cost approximately 60-70 million Euros.

==Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors==
==Supporters==
Historically, Omonia has been one of the most popular teams in Cyprus since the creation of the club. A 2022 study conducted by the University of Nicosia found Omonia to be the most popular team on the island by far, with 30.7% of the approximately 1500 contestants stating they support the club.

Omonia holds the record for the most league tickets sold by a Cypriot team in a 32-game season (162,061 during the 2009–10 campaign). The club also holds the Cypriot record for the highest average attendance in a season (11,003 during the 2003–04 campaign).

Omonia supporters are known for their left-leaning, socialist character, with many stating that they associate themselves with the Progressive Party of Working People. Omonia is also traditionally regarded as the club of &quot;the people&quot; and Cyprus&#x27; working class. Many of Omonia&#x27;s supporters can be seen waving banners bearing Che Guevara&#x27;s image.

===Financial crisis and 2013 Pan-Cypriot fundraiser===
By the end of February 2013, Omonia was struggling to meet the UEFA criteria due to the economic crisis that had engulfed the club. The club&#x27;s president then decided to start a fundraiser and called for the supporters of the club to donate as much as they could. Hundreds of events were organised island wide with the motto; &quot;ΕΙΜΑΙ ΟΜΟΝΟΙΑ ΔΗΛΩΝΩ ΠΑΡΩΝ&quot; meaning, &quot;I&#x27;M WITH OMONIA, I DECLARE MYSELF PRESENT.&quot; Current and former players contributed by signing autographs and selling club merchandise. Although the situation at the beginning was described as grim, money poured in from all over the island and from abroad including England and the United States. In about a month and a half, €3.5 million was collected from the club&#x27;s supporters.

=== Gate 9 ===
The team&#x27;s ultras group, Gate 9, was established in 1992. The group would occupy the GSP Stadium&#x27;s north stand during Omonia&#x27;s home games. Gate 9 has established relations with other left wing supporters such as those of Hapoel Tel Aviv and Standard Liège.

On 29 May 2018, the club agreed to turn its football department into a for-profit company, under the ownership of Stavros Papastavrou. Gate 9 had previously condemned the idea and published several statements criticising it. On the same day, Gate 9 declared they would no longer support the team, and announced they would create their own football club, which would &quot;respect the principles and history of Omonia&quot;. People&#x27;s Athletic Club Omonia 29M was founded on 23 July 2018 and currently plays in the Cypriot First Division.

<text>FC Shkupi (, ) is a professional football club based in Čair, Skopje, North Macedonia. The club plays in the Macedonian First Football League, which is the top tier of football in North Macedonia.

==History==

After financial issues with main sponsor Jugomagnat, Sloga went through an unstable period. In 2012, Sloga was merged with FC Albarsa to form FK Shkupi. However, the Football Federation of Macedonia does not consider Shkupi to be successors to the original Sloga Jugomagnat for political reasons as the FFM allowed a merging between Vardar, the most popular club among ethnic Macedonians and Miravci with Vardar avoiding relegation and keeping its previous trophies and accolades. Despite the FFM not recognising Shkupi&#x27;s track records and honours as Sloga, Sloga&#x27;s official support firm, previous players and management, recognize Shkupi as its successor.

After finishing Macedonian First league in the fourth place in the 2017–18 season, Shkupi played in the Europa League qualifiers for the first time. In the 2021–22 season the club were crowned the champion of country for the first time in its history.

==Supporters==
On 13 February 2011, a large gathering of Vardar supporters, Komiti Skopje, congregated at the Skopje Fortress to protect a construction site on the grounds of the fortress. 

The Shvercerat are known for taking rival team supporter&#x27;s banner. They have succeeded in taking the &quot;Kratovo&quot; banner of Sileks, the &quot;Vojvodi&quot; banner of Teteks, &quot;Komiti Zapad&quot; banner of Vardar, &quot;Vinari&quot; banner of Vardar Negotino, &quot;Prilep&quot; banner of Pobeda, &quot;Green Front&quot; and &quot;BFC Hooligans&quot; banners of Pelister.

== Crest and colours ==
The logo of Shkupi consists of a shield-shaped emblem primarily colored in blue and white, symbolizing the team’s identity and heritage. At the top of the shield, the words “Football Club SHKUPI” are prominently displayed, representing the club’s official name.

The central area features the initials “SH” surrounded by vertical stripes, which add a sense of structure and balance. Below the initials, the year “1927” is inscribed, marking the club’s foundation and highlighting its long-standing history in football.

The bottom section of the logo contains a stylized depiction of a football, emphasizing the sport the club represents. Flanking the shield on both sides are laurel branches, a traditional symbol of victory and achievement, underscoring the club’s aspirations and successes.

<text>Glentoran Football Club is a professional football club based in East Belfast, Northern Ireland, that plays in the NIFL Premiership. The club was founded in 1882 and has since won more than 130 major honours.

==History==
===The early years===
Glentoran was founded in 1882 by the workers of the Protestant-dominated Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard, and draws much of its identity from its industrial roots in East Belfast. The shipyard’s iconic cranes still overlook their ground - The Oval - symbolising the club’s heritage. In 1889, Glentoran FC was established as a limited company, and benefited from investments by local industrial leaders Viscount Pirrie and G.W. Wolff. This investment further tied the club to the nearby Harland and Wolff shipyard workers.

Glentoran made its first appearance in the Irish Cup during the 1886-87 season. They reached the semi-final of the competition, where they were beaten 2-1 by Ulster. The Irish League was established in 1890, with Glentoran being among the founding members, alongside Clarence, Cliftonville, Distillery, Linfield, Milford, Oldpark and Ulster. In the inaugural season, Glentoran finished in 5th place. In 1894, Glentoran won the first of its 23 league titles.

=== Vienna Cup ===
In 1914, Glentoran undertook their first European tour, with the key highlight being their participation and victory in the Vienna Cup. The tour began with a 4-3 loss to Deutsche in Prague, followed by a 4-1 win over Hertha Berlin. The team then traveled to Vienna for the Vienna Cup, a week-long tournament organised by the Vienna Football Club. In the first match against a Vienna select team, Glentoran dominated but conceded a late equalizer, resulting in a 1-1 draw. The final match was decisive, and Glentoran secured a convincing victory to win the Vienna Cup, making them the first British team to claim a European trophy.

===1960s===
In 1964–65, Glentoran faced Panathinaikos in the European Cup and drew 2–2 at home and lost 3–2 away. In the following season&#x27;s Fairs Cup, they faced Antwerp resulting a 1–0 defeat away and 3–3 draw at home. The Cup-Winners&#x27; Cup in 1966–67 saw Glentoran draw 1–1 with Rangers in front of a packed Oval before losing the away leg 4–0.

Glentoran’s greatest moment in Europe came in a 1967 European Cup tie against Benfica. In the first leg at The Oval, Glentoran took an early lead with a penalty before football legend Eusébio equalized, ending the match 1–1. In the return leg at Benfica’s Estádio da Luz, part-time Glentoran defied expectations with a 0–0 draw. Although Benfica advanced on away goals, Glentoran became the first team eliminated by this rule and the first to prevent Benfica from scoring at home.

In 1967, Glentoran took the unusual step of running the Detroit Cougars football franchise in the United Soccer Association. The newly formed league had planned for an inaugural season in 1968, but when the rival National Professional Soccer League announced a start date of 1967 and a television contract with CBS, the league owners decided to fast track their league by importing entire squads from Europe and South America.

George Best watched Glentoran with his grandfather as a youth, but was rejected by the club for being &quot;too small and light&quot;. However, Best did make one appearance for Glentoran, in the club&#x27;s centenary match against Manchester United.

===1970s===
The club won the Irish league title in 1972 and 1977, coupled with an Irish Cup win in 1973. This cup win gave Glentoran a place the following season in the European Cup Winners Cup. In November 1973, Glentoran made history by becoming the first Irish club to reach the quarter-finals of the competition with a 3–1 victory over Brann in Belfast, following a 1–1 draw in Bergen. They faced Borussia Mönchengladbach in the quarter-finals and were beaten 2–0 and 5–0. Four seasons later they faced Juventus in a European Cup match and lost 1–0 at home and 5–0 away.

===1980s===
In 1981–82, Glentoran reached the second round of the European Cup and faced eventual semi-finalists CSKA Sofia. After a 2–0 defeat away, Glentoran went 2–0 up in the return leg to force the game into extra time. The final result was 2–1, Glentoran going out 3–2 on aggregate.

The 1985 Irish Cup final between Glentoran and Linfield featured a memorable incident: Glentoran fans brought a cockerel, their club emblem, and a pig painted in Linfield’s royal blue to the match, both of which stayed on the sidelines throughout. Fans repeated the cockerel tradition at the 2006 final, but Glentoran lost 2–1, ending their unbeaten post-war record of five consecutive Irish Cup final victories against Linfield, a streak that began in 1966.

===1990s===
In 1995 Glentoran played their traditional Boxing Day match against Linfield on a snow-covered pitch. In the first half the orange ball was damaged, and not having a replacement the teams were forced to play with a white ball for the remainder of the game. The incident was used as a &quot;What Happened Next&quot; question on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;.

Former Linfield manager Roy Coyle took charge of the club in 1997 and under his stewardship the club entered another period of success. In Coyle&#x27;s first cup final in charge he gave up the right to lead the team out, instead he asked long serving Kitman Teddy Horner have this honour.

===2000s===
The 2002–03 season was one of the club&#x27;s most successful in recent times. Of a potential four trophies, Glentoran won three, capturing the Irish League championship, Irish League Cup and County Antrim Shield but fell at the final hurdle, losing the Irish Cup Final 1–0 to Coleraine. The only Irish League to complete the clean sweep of all trophies is Linfield who have achieved this on 3 occasions. They won 7 trophies in 1921–22 and 7 in 1961–62 and also 4 trophies in 1955–56. To come so close to a clean sweep in 2003 and fail was a bitter pill to swallow.

On 23 April 2005, Glentoran defeated their rivals Linfield in the second last game but one of the league season. In the 93rd minute of the match, Glentoran, who needed victory in order to have a chance of clinching the league title, scored a goal via their centre forward (and former Linfield player) Chris Morgan. There were confrontations between the two sets of fans following the match. Hooliganism was commonplace at matches between the clubs in the past.

Roy Coyle won 16 trophies with Glentoran and is the club&#x27;s most successful manager in the club&#x27;s history.

===Financial troubles (2011–2019)===
====Millar (2006–2007)====
After eight years in charge of Glentoran, Roy Coyle resigned as manager after a string of indifferent results. On 14 February 2006 the club announced that former Newry City manager Paul Millar was to take over the manager&#x27;s position. He led the team into the Irish Cup final with rivals Linfield. Despite taking the lead in the first half, Linfield won the game with two goals from Peter Thompson. He also led his new club to their biggest ever defeat against their cross-city rivals Linfield in a 6–0 defeat at Windsor Park. The Glens had sought to reduce the gap between them and Linfield by signing Kyle Neill and Gary Hamilton from Portadown and re-signing former fan&#x27;s favourite Gary Smyth. Also arriving was another former player, Jason Hill, former Portadown and Newry City player Cullen Feeney and promising young keeper Ciaran McLaughlin from Ards.

Paul Millar was dismissed as manager on 17 May 2007, after just 15 months in the role. Despite leading the team to two consecutive second-place finishes behind Linfield, he lost the support of the board and fans. 

====McDonald (2007–2010)====
On 24 May 2007 former Crusaders and Glenavon manager Roy Walker was appointed as Glentoran manager along with assistant manager Billy Sinclair. Walker previously led Crusaders to two league titles in 1995 and 1997. After leaving football management for seven years, Walker became a football analyst with BBC Radio Ulster. He was quoted as saying, &quot;Glentoran were my boyhood team and are probably the only club which could have attracted me back.&quot;

However, on 26 May 2007 it was revealed that Walker would not be able to take up the post, due to not possessing the necessary UEFA coaching qualifications. Less than a week later, Glentoran appointed Alan McDonald as manager, replacing Roy Walker, who stepped down but vowed not to rest until director of football Tom Dick resigned. Dick eventually did so but criticized chairman Stafford Reynolds, who later announced he would step down if a suitable replacement was found. As manager, McDonald secured several players, including former Glentoran player Rory Hamill, Daryl Fordyce (Portsmouth), Jamie McGovern (West Brom), David Scullion (Dungannon Swifts), and re-signed Chris Morgan and Tim McCann. Meanwhile, Darren Lockhart and Gary Smith left on loan to Crusaders. In January, Glentoran added Shane McCabe (Dungannon) and Darren Boyce (Coleraine) to the squad.

Alan McDonald won two trophies with The Glens and also led the Glens to the final of the Setanta Cup. In McDonald&#x27;s first season as manager, Glentoran defeated Crusaders in the County Antrim Shield final. The next season, Glentoran won the league after a strong race with Linfield. Glentoran finished three successive seasons, 2006–2008, as runners-up to three times Double Champions Linfield. Since then, notable signings at the club include Matthew Burrows, from Dundela (where he scored fifty-three goals last term), Johnny Taylor (from Hearts) and former Lisburn Distillery player Andy Waterworth for a fee of £30,000. Glentoran&#x27;s build up to the season included friendlies against Hearts, Burnley and Ipswich Town. However, Glentoran&#x27;s start to the season was delayed by a referee strike led by their association&#x27;s Chairman, David Malcolm, citing higher wage demands. This ultimately postponed all week one fixtures. The following week, in the game against Glenavon, Glentoran&#x27;s pitch was declared unplayable. Matches against Bangor and then Linfield were cancelled, and this led to Glentoran facing Bangor in the first Irish League game to be played on a Sunday. The historic scoreline was 1–0.

Glentoran also unexpectedly reached the final of the Setanta Sports Cup 2008, a cup in which the top four clubs from both the Irish League and League of Ireland play each other. Glentoran defeated Linfield with a 4–1 win, making the group a more open competition. This was followed up by a 1–0 win in a home match again St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. In the final on 13 October 2008, Glentoran were defeated by League of Ireland side Cork City 2–1 at Turners Cross. On 2 May 2009 Glentoran won the first ever Irish Premiership by defeating Cliftonville 3–1 at The Oval. This was their first league title since a 2005 win, ending Linfield&#x27;s 3-year dominance on all fronts. Alan McDonald would in the coming weeks sign a new 2-year contract with the club after much speculation, keeping him there until 2011. Glentoran&#x27;s only summer signings for 2009 were Richard Clarke from Newry City and Northern Ireland international Keith Gillespie on a free transfer.

====Young (2010–2012)====

In March 2010, after McDonald resigned, former player Scott Young was put in charge of the Glens until the end of the 2010–11 season along with Pete Batey as assistant manager and Tim McCann as head coach. Young led Glentoran into the 2009–10 Irish League Cup final against Coleraine. The bannsiders were the favourites for the match but the Glens were the team who came out victorious, winning 4–1 on penalties after the match ended in a 2–2 draw. At the end of the season, Young along with Batey and McCann signed a deal with the Glens to stay on as manager. Former Glentoran manager Roy Coyle, who brought a huge amount of success, became director of football.

Young released some of the club&#x27;s higher-profile players, including Michael Halliday and Keith Gillespie. Halliday joined North Belfast side Crusaders. Kyle Neill also left the club and joined Glenavon. Dean Fitzgerald and Shane McCabe were also among the players released.

Gary Hamilton went out on loan to Glenavon, and back in December 2011 took on the role as manager of the club (after the resignation of Marty Quinn), after being released of his playing obligations by Glentoran. During Young&#x27;s first season as manager, Glentoran&#x27;s financial difficulties escalated, until HMRC issued Glentoran a winding-up order, and gave the club until the beginning of January 2011 to clear all outstanding debts which totalled over £300,000. A fundraising organisation, Spirit of &#x27;41 (which was named after the year when The Oval was bombed by Germans and the massive effort to rebuild it) was set up, and to this day has raised over £25,000. On 12 January 2011, a special EGM was held which set out the proposals that would save Glentoran from oblivion and change radically how the club is run. The vote was passed unanimously with the condition that 3 new board members were added, including a new chairman, and the previous chairman stepped down to vice-chairman.

On 5 October 2010, Glentoran player Matty Burrows scored a backheel goal against Portadown, which won Burrows the ESPN goal of the season and Sky Sports goal of the season. The goal also achieved millions of views on YouTube and went up against world-famous player Lionel Messi for the FIFA goal of the season award. Burrows narrowly lost out on the award with many saying he did not win because he wasn&#x27;t a high-profile player.

On 7 July 2011, Glentoran beat Macedonian side FK Renova in the Europa League first qualifying round after the Glens overturned a 2–1 away defeat by winning the home leg 2–1 at The Oval and thus levelling the score on aggregate. The match was decided by penalties. Glentoran progressed after winning the shoot-out 3–2.

Young started his second season very well, with a 2–1 win away to Crusaders. However, the 2011–12 season would turn out to be disappointing for Young and the club. Rory Patterson was set to come back at the club, but could not agree on the contract following the finance problems. Patterson joined Glentoran&#x27;s bitter rivals Linfield. However, Matty Burrows returned to the club, but struggled to maintain his place. The club then started to go through a run of poor results and started to lose supporters. Despite beating Linfield three times, Glentoran lost in the County Antrim Shield final to Cliftonville and continued their losing streak in the league. On 14 January 2012, Glentoran were knocked out of the 2011–12 Irish Cup by Amateur league side Newington Youth Club. Young then resigned after the game. Director of Football Roy Coyle was put in charge for the match against Ballymena United.

====Patterson (2012–2015)====

Former Lisburn Distillery boss Paul Kirk, former Crusaders and Ballymena United boss Roy Walker, former Cliftonville boss Eddie Patterson, and former Coleraine boss Marty Quinn were among the possible contenders for the job including former player Pat McGibbon and Ian Foster. Walker and Patterson applied for the job along with McGibbon and Foster on 1 February 2012. Patterson was appointed manager of the club on Wednesday 22 February 2012. Glentoran finished the 2011–12 league season in 6th place, a massive 28 points behind the league champions; cross-city rivals Linfield. However, some consolation came from the fact that they beat Linfield in all four league meetings between the sides that season, without conceding a goal in the process.

During the summer of 2012, Patterson made several signings such as Marcus Kane, Jay Magee and Mark Clarke. The Glens started the 2012–13 season well with a 3–1 victory over Donegal Celtic. This was followed by three consecutive 1–1 draws against Glenavon, Cliftonville and Linfield. One day before the game against Linfield, the club announced the signing of Stuart Elliott, who was returning to the club where he made his name before moving across the water to play for Hull City, Motherwell and Hamilton Academical. Glentoran defeated Ballinamallard United 4–1 and Dungannon Swifts 3–1 in the space of a week, pushing them up to second in the league. The Glens then secured a 0–0 home draw against Coleraine in a top of the table clash before defeating Lisburn Distillery 3–0 a week later. A 1–1 draw against Ballymena United at the Showgrounds made it nine league games unbeaten from the start of the season.

However, the unbeaten run came to an end in the next game when Crusaders won 2–0 at Seaview on 6 October 2012, just 5 days after an enthralling County Antrim Shield quarter-final defeat against Linfield which saw three goals in the final minutes of the game, ending 3–2 to Linfield. One week after the Crusaders loss, Glentoran was beaten for the second successive league game (their first home loss of the season), when Portadown won 1–0 at The Oval.

The club&#x27;s financial problems would soon come to light again. In November 2012 it was reported that the squad had refused to train because they had not received their wages for two months. If the problem continued, it may have reached the stage where the players would have the right to be released from their contracts. Back on the field, the club had mixed results in the next six league games. Three wins, a draw, and two defeats which included a disappointing 2–1 loss away to Donegal Celtic, left the Glens sitting in fifth place in the league at the end of November, twelve points behind pacesetters Cliftonville.

The 2012–13 league campaign ultimately ended with the club finishing fourth in the table. However, the season ended on a high note as the Glens overcame favourites and newly crowned league champions Cliftonville 3–1 after extra time in the Irish Cup final on 4 May 2013. This was the club&#x27;s first Irish Cup win in nine years.

In the 2014–15 Season Glentoran won another Irish cup against Portadown and the 2nd under Eddie Patterson. The game was played at The Oval because construction work at Windsor park had gone wrong and the Kop stand was deemed unstable and needed to be knocked down. The game finished 1–0 after a very wet afternoon in East Belfast.

After defeating Carrick Rangers 2–0 at home, Eddie Patterson was sacked. Former manager Roy Coyle took over for the next game as caretaker boss.

====Kernaghan (2015–2016)====
On 9 November 2015 Alan Kernaghan was appointed as Glentoran manager.
Kernaghan started with some promising results and managed to end the 2015/16 season in 5th Position.The Glens made several signings that summer in the hope of returning to the top 3 and returning to regular European football signing included former Ballymena United goalkeeper Dwayne Nelson, Portadown defender Ross Redman, resigned former player James Ferrin, Eric Foley from Galway United and the signing of Rangers Spanish legend Nacho Novo the Glens started the season inconsistently with two 1–0 wins against Dungannon Swifts and Portadown and two defeats against Cliftonville and struggling Carrick Rangers. The pressure starting to mount on Kernaghan was severely increased when they were beaten 4–1 by Coleraine with many thinking the writing was on the wall for Kernaghan reign as manager and following a shock 3–2 League Cup defeat to Championship side Annagh United, Kernaghan resigned as manager of Glentoran.

====Haveron (2016–2018)====
Gary Haveron became manager on 28 September 2016. In January 2017, Glentoran suffered a 2–1 Irish Cup 5th Round defeat at the Oval to fierce rivals Linfield after extra time. Haveron was sacked by the club on 21 February 2018, following a 2–1 defeat to Ards at the Oval, with the club citing his performances were not good enough. The team was sixth in the league at that stage. Haveron did, however, lead the Glens to a 2017 Boxing Day victory, beating Linfield 2–1.

====McFall (2018–2019)====
Following Haverons dismissal, Glentoran reappointed Ronnie McFall as manager. A management reshuffle was announced which saw Gary Smyth become his assistant manager and Paul Leeman become a coach at the club. Kieran Harding was also an assistant to McFall. McFalls second spell proved unsuccessful. McFall left the club on 3 January 2019. At that point, the team were 9th in the league table, 5 points above the relegation zone.

====Smyth (2019)====
Gary Smyth became the caretaker manager of Glentoran on 3 January 2019. His first match was a 4–1 defeat to Crusaders in the Irish Cup. Paul Leeman was his assistant, with Kieran Harding, who was assistant to McFall becoming a coach. The months after saw an improvement in form. Smyth, who did not hold the required coaching qualifications to lead the club into the playoffs or UEFA competition was replaced on 31 March 2019, the deadline day for UEFA Licensing by Mick McDermott.

===New ownership and management (2019–)===
Mick McDermott became Glentoran manager as part of a deal involving new investment in the club, which was approved by 96% of shareholders at an EGM on 16 May 2019. Paul Millar returned as assistant manager, while Kieran Harding stayed on as coach. However, Gary Smyth and Paul Leeman were absent from the dugout in subsequent matches. On 21 May, the club announced Smyth’s departure, a decision that divided fans. Leeman left two days later, despite both being offered their previous roles under the new management team.

On 4 February 2020, the Glentoran Chairman Stephen Henderson announced on behalf of the club, that it was finally free of external debt. Once having been £1.77 million in the red, the Board of Directors had cleared 80% of the debt across the decade and prior to the new investment in the club. A combination of the investor and the old board then settled the final remaining debt with the last outstanding creditor.

During McDermott&#x27;s first full season in charge at the East Belfast club, he and Millar led the side to victory in the Irish Cup final on 31 July 2020. Glentoran defeated Ballymena United 2–1 in the final after extra-time, with goals coming from Paul O&#x27;Neill and Robbie McDaid.

McDermott was replaced by Rodney McAree on 17 January 2023. McAree managed Glentoran until the conclusion of the 2022/23 season, and guided them to European qualification. In June 2023, McAree departed Glentoran and was replaced by former Linfield manager, Warren Feeney. 
This move was one in that was viewed controversially by many Glentoran supporters, with Feeney’s Linfield history and lack of managerial success being two of the biggest sticking points with Glens fans.

In July 2023, Glentoran were involved in a record-breaking Europa Conference League game against Gzira United from Malta. The first leg finished 2-2, with the second leg finishing 1-1. The tie then went to extra time and penalties, with Gzira winning 14–13 on penalties. This was the highest scoring penalty shoot-out ever in European competition.

Feeney left the club by mutual consent on 15 March 2024, following a major backlash from most of the fans supporters clubs. Declan Devine was subsequently appointed as caretaker until the end of the season.

==Stadium and redevelopment==

In March 2003, the club&#x27;s board of directors advised the shareholders of Glentoran Recreation Company Ltd to sell the Oval to a property development holding company called Girona. To date, no new ground has materialised. A campaign waged by a group of volunteer supporters called Rest In East, was then set up to keep the club in east Belfast. The club&#x27;s board of directors have suggested moving close to Comber, well outside the city bounds of Belfast, which the majority of supporters firmly oppose.

On 3 November 2005 a fans forum voted 417–0 in favour of forming Glentoran Community Trust, the first supporters&#x27; trust to be formed in Northern Ireland. It was officially formed on 15 May 2006 and registered with the Registry of Companies Belfast under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1965–1978. The trust sits completely independent of the parent club, giving the ordinary non-shareholding supporter a voice. On 29 January 2008, the GCT took another historic step, when one of its members, Stephen Henderson was elected to the board of directors by the shareholders of Glentoran FC, with the most votes ever gained in an election. This would prove an important step for the club during the financial crisis that would soon engulf it.

On 12 January 2011, a resolution was passed that gives the GCT two permanent board members.
Recently, Glentoran formed a strategic alliance partnership with Insaka AFC, the football club of the African Youth Diaspora in the Irish Republic by forming Insaka-Glentoran Football Academy at the same time becoming the first club on the island of Ireland to adopt a whole club approach to the UEFA &#x27;Respect&#x27; campaign.

On 24 May 2016, supporters approved a board recommendation, at the club end of season AGM, to demolish and redevelop The Oval into a modern new community-based stadium, over alternative proposed moves to sites at Sydenham and Titanic Quarter. Funding will come from a £10million amount that has been on hold for the Glens under the Government&#x27;s £110m sports grounds improvement programme that has led to the creation of the new Windsor Park and Ulster Rugby&#x27;s Kingspan Stadium in tandem with redevelopment at venues across the country.

In March 2021 Glentoran submitted plans to redevelop The Oval, at cost of £8m to £10m. However the plans were suspended after the 2022 collapse of Stormont, as funding could not be secured.

===Academy===
Glentoran runs the Glentoran Academy, to help promote football to younger players. It is the fastest growing football academy in the country and includes players, both boys and girls from the age of 4. The academy also includes a disability section and a Polish language section, where playing for the team requires attendance at training and at English language classes. In 2015–16, the club had 44 players representing Northern Ireland at different age groups, twice as many as any other club. In the summer of 2016, 4 more players left the academy to take up places at English professional clubs academies. The academy was set up in June 2008.

<text>AC Vantaan Allianssi (or AC Allianssi) was a Finnish football club, based in the town of Vantaa.

==History==
Allianssi were a club in decline, following an 8–0 defeat at fellow Finnish club FC Haka. The match was believed to have been fixed by a Belgian-Chinese betting cartel, which took control of the club in summer 2005. A subsequent police investigation failed to find sufficient evidence of match fixing though. In 2006, a former managing director, Olivier Suray, admitted that the notorious match was fixed. However, he accused Chinese owner Ye Zheyun of fixing.

On 11 April 2006, club chairman Erkki Salo announced that the club would be filing for bankruptcy with immediate effect.

<doc id="828181" wikidata="Q219929" url="?curid=828181" title="FK Željezničar Sarajevo">
<text>Fudbalski klub Željezničar Sarajevo (; English: Football Club Željezničar Sarajevo), commonly referred to as Željo, is a professional football club, based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The name &quot;Željezničar&quot; means &quot;railway worker&quot;, originating from their establishment by a group of railway workers in 1921. Throughout its history, the club has cultivated a reputation for producing talented home-grown players through its youth school.

During the days of socialist Yugoslavia, FK Željezničar were national champions in the 1971–72 season, qualifying for the European Cup during the 1972–73 season. The club has also finished as runners-up once in the league, and contested 1980–81 Yugoslav Cup final. In Europe, the club reached UEFA Cup semi-finals during the 1984–85 season and the quarter-finals during the 1971–72 season.

Željezničar is the most successful football team in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, having won 6 Bosnian championships, 6 Bosnian Cups and 3 Bosnian Supercups. The club&#x27;s so far best post-war European result was qualifying to the 2002–03 Champions League third qualifying round, losing to Newcastle United. Their biggest rival is FK Sarajevo with whom they contest the biggest football match in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Sarajevo derby.

==History==
===Pre-independence (1921–1992)===
Željezničar was formed by a group of railway workers. During the early 20th century, there were several football clubs in Sarajevo. They were rich and usually backed by various organizations, most of them on an ethnic basis: Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Jews, unlike Željezničar. Since it was a financially poor club, they used to organize dance nights and all the profits made were later used to buy shoes and balls.

Financial problems were not the only ones. The club&#x27;s embrace of members of all ethnic backgrounds was seen as a threat by many at the time, so Željezničar was suppressed in various ways. Despite that, the club managed to survive, and even beat wealthier clubs. The first official match, a friendly, was played at Kovačići, a Sarajevo settlement, on 17 September 1921 against SAŠK Napredak which resulted in a 5–1 defeat. The next day another game was played, a 2–1 loss against Sarajevski ŠK.

In 1941, World War II came to Sarajevo, and all football activity was stopped. Many footballers were members of the resistance troops, and some of them were killed. After the war, Željo was reborn, and in 1946, it won the Bosnian Republic championship which was one of the 7 regional leagues formed in order to provide participants to the restored Yugoslav championship starting next season. As winners, Željezničar became one of the Bosnian representatives in the Yugoslav top-flight. Soon after, the Sarajevo citizens formed a new club called FK Sarajevo, the club that has remained a major annoyance to Željezničar&#x27;s fans (known as The Maniacs) until today. That had an influence on the club, so it needed several years to come back to the first division. For most of the time, Željezničar played in the top level. It was relegated four times (the last time in the 1976–77 season), but every time (except the first time in 1947) it returned quickly.

====Planinić affair====

In 1964, the Football Association of Yugoslavia found Željezničar guilty for match fixing. Alongside Željezničar, Hajduk Split and Trešnjevka were found guilty and were ejected from the First Yugoslav League. Among others, Željezničar players Ivica Osim and Mišo Smajlović were banned from football for one year, and executives from Željezničar including then club president Nusret Mahić were banned from football for life. After a month it was decided that the clubs will stay in the league but points will be deducted, six from Željezničar and five from Hajduk and Trešnjevka each.

====UEFA Cup 1971–72 quarter-finalists====
The club first appeared in European competitions during the 1963 Mitropa Cup, however serious competitions had to wait until the early 1970s when the team finished the 1970–71 Yugoslav First League season in 2nd place, a result which allowed the club to play in the 1971–72 UEFA Cup where they made the quarter-finals on their very first appearance losing to Ferencvárosi in a penalty shootout.

====1971–72 Yugoslav champions====
1971–72 Yugoslav First League &quot;table (top 5 only)&quot;:
Željezničar&#x27;s greatest domestic success at the time came in the 1971–72 season when the team won the championship title, their only top-tier title in the Yugoslav period, which qualified the club for the European Cup during the 1972–73 season where they were eliminated in the first round by Derby County.

Željezničar also finished in third place in the top-tier league on two occasions in a league traditionally dominated by the big four clubs (Red Star Belgrade, Partizan, Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb).

====1980–81 Marshal Tito Cup finalists====
In the 1980–81 season, Željezničar reached the Yugoslav cup final (&quot;Marshal Tito Cup&quot;), but lost 2–3 to another Bosnian side Velež Mostar with both Mehmed Baždarević and Vahid Halilhodžić scoring a brace for their respective teams. The venue for the final was the Red Star Stadium in Belgrade played in front of 40,000 fans. That season, Željezničar finished the 1980–81 Yugoslav First League in a disappointing 14th position which meant the club did not play in Europe even though it made the Yugoslav Cup final.

====UEFA Cup 1984–85 semi-finalists====
Željezničar&#x27;s best international result was recorded in the 1984–85 season. The team, led by manager Ivica Osim, reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup (renamed to UEFA Europa League since the 2009–10 season) where they were eliminated by Hungarian team Videoton. Željezničar finished the domestic championship in third place in the season before, qualifying them for the competition. Željezničar appeared to have had the result at home, leading 2–0 (3–3 on aggregate) against the Hungarians that would send them into a final against Spanish club Real Madrid on the away goals rule; however, two minutes from full-time Videoton scored a crucial goal, eliminating the home side 4–3 on aggregate. Edin Bahtić finished the competition as second-top scorer with 7 goals, one short of József Szabó.

Prior to this success, the team played the quarter-final stage of the inaugural year of the UEFA Cup competition.

===Post-independence (1992–present)===
After the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, war broke out and football stopped. The game between Željezničar and FK Rad scheduled to be played on 5 April 1992 at Stadion Grbavica as part of Round 26 of the 1991–92 Yugoslav First League was abandoned 35 minutes (14:55 p.m. local time) before kick-off due to gunfire around the stadium, a result of the first attack on Sarajevo. Ultimately, the club&#x27;s final completed match in the Yugoslav Championship was a 6–1 defeat on 29 March 1992 in Belgrade against Partizan. Players like Mario Stanić, Rade Bogdanović, Gordan Vidović, Suvad Katana and many others had days earlier went abroad to escape the horror of war, leaving it up to &quot;junior players&quot; to play out remaining rounds of the championships. However, all of Željezničar&#x27;s matches in the 2nd half of the 1991–92 season were declared void due to rule, as the club could not play out remaining matches due to the ensuing war. In 25 (out of possible 33) rounds completed, the club collected 6 wins, 4 draws and 15 losses, with a 22:42 goal difference.

The stadium was right on the front lines, and on 7 May 1992, the western side was destroyed along with SD Željezničar premises near by, however Željezničar managed to take part in the 1994–95 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina championship, playing its home matches in Grbavica. The fourth-place result was not as important as simply taking part.

The war ended in 1995 so a regular championship was formed contested only by Bosniak and Croatian clubs with Serb clubs joining some years later.

During the 1997–98 championship, a play-off was held and the final match on 5 June saw two big city rivals playing for the trophy. FK Sarajevo played well, their shots were cleared from the goal-line twice. In the 89th minute, one ball was intercepted on the left side, and after a couple of passes it came to Željezničar forward Hadis Zubanović who scored a dramatic winner. That was the only goal of the game which brought his club its first championship title in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among Željezničar club fans, this day, titled &quot;Zubandan&quot;, is celebrated every year.

====2000s: Two-time league champions====
For a long time, Željezničar were the only club that were able to defend their title in the Bosnian Premier League, as champions in the 2000–01 and 2001–02 season under the command of Ivica Osim&#x27;s son, Amar Osim. The club repeated this success again in the early 2010s. Under Amar&#x27;s command, Željezničar also won the 2000–01 national cup, which completed the double, the first time any club in Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved that, securing also the 2001 Bosnian Supercup. In the 2001–02 season, they were runners-up in the cup, but were not able to defend their Bosnian Supercup title (even though they won the league) as it was discontinued. Amar was dismissed from the club in October 2003 after the club was runner-up in the 2002–03 season, won the 2002–03 national cup and reached the club&#x27;s biggest European success since competing as part of the Bosnian Premier League, that is the 2002–03 Champions league third qualifying round which they lost against Newcastle United. They continued their journey in the UEFA Cup, losing to Málaga due to a penalty they scored in the second leg. Željezničar finished as runners-up both seasons after Amar Osim&#x27;s departure. After they secured qualification for the 2005–06 UEFA Cup through their league position, they failed to get a licence for European competition, missing out on substantial financial gain from UEFA. This led to many problems for the club, and over the next four seasons Željezničar struggled in the middle of the league.

As the best Bosnian club, the club played in European cups every year. The best result (for Bosnian club football as well since independence) came in 2002, when Željezničar reached the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, having eliminated Akraness and Lillestrøm in previous rounds to get there. Sir Bobby Robson&#x27;s Newcastle United, captained by Alan Shearer, were too strong, winning 5–0 on aggregate when Sanel Jahić received a red card in the 69th minute of the reverse leg at St James&#x27; Park. The game was held at Koševo Stadium in front of 36,000 fans from all over Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to this day is among the best attended games in Bosnian club football history, although short of a match at the same stadium between the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team&#x27;s 2–1 friendly win over Italy in November 1996, which was attended by 40,000. Newcastle United reached the second group stage of the tournament later on in the season.

The club, as result of losing to Newcastle United, entered the UEFA Cup first round, but lost to Málaga who were an eventual quarter-finalist.

====2010s: Three-time league champions====
With the return of Amar Osim in the summer of 2009, Željezničar once more claimed the title in the 2009–10 season, but failed to take the double as they lost in the final of the 2009–10 Bosnian cup to Borac Banja Luka on away goals, while remaining undefeated. In the following 2010–11 season, the club failed to defend their Premier League title, finishing third. However, Željezničar managed to win the national cup instead, their fourth, against Čelik Zenica. During the 2011–12 season, they brought back the league title to Grbavica, their sixth domestic league title, three rounds before the end of the season, breaking many records on the way (run of 35 games without loss; 12 straight league wins; 3 seasons in Bosnian Cup competition without loss). Željezničar also won the 2011–12 Bosnian cup, claiming their second double in their history, both won under the managing of Amar Osim. As a result, Amar Osim became the most successful manager in terms of trophies won since the creation of the club, with nine. The club was for a long time undefeated in the Bosnian Cup matches since the first round of the 2008–09 Bosnian Cup season, having won two Cup finals and losing one on aggregate since the 2008–09 season.

During the 2010–11 season, Željezničar won their fourth cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They advanced to the final beating Široki Brijeg on 3–0 aggregate. In the final they clash with rivals from the former Yugoslav League, Čelik Zenica. The first game was played at Grbavica Stadium which finished 1–0 in favor of the home team. The second game was played at Bilino Polje Stadium which Željezničar won 3–0 and won 4–0 on aggregate. That concluded Željezničar&#x27;s season in which they were automatically gave to compete in the UEFA Europa League. Željezničar were able to celebrate their 90th birthday with a trophy.

In the season 2011–12, Željezničar won their 6th title in the team&#x27;s existence. They won the title with three rounds left in the competition. They repeated the successful campaign in cup competition also when they won the title with 1–0 on aggregate against Široki Brijeg. That was the first double for any club since unified Bosnia and Herzegovina football competitions started in 2002–03 season. In the 2012–13 season, Željezničar won their 7th title in the club&#x27;s history, 6th Bosnian one, once again under the guidance of Amar Osim.

Between 2013 and 2018, Željezničar had a trophy drought as it did not win any trophies in that period, even though they could have on multiple occasions as they finished 2nd on three occasions, every time just missing out on the title.

The club has had a poor final series results (post regular season); finishing second during competitions for seasons 2016–17 (by a single point; being first until the final two rounds) and 2017–18 surrendering titles to rivals Zrinjski Mostar, who were managed by Blaž Slišković, both times. Further disappointments came when club failed to acquire license to compete in 2019–20 European competitions.

The trophy drought ended in May 2018, as the club won the 2017–18 Bosnian Cup under the guidance of then manager Admir Adžem.

In the period from October to December 2018, the club lost five league matches in a row, the worst in the club&#x27;s history. Manager Milomir Odović resigned after the fourth consecutive loss. On 31 December 2018, Amar Osim came back for a second time to manager Željezničar, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with the club.

====2020s: 100 years of the club====
The 2019–20 Bosnian Premier League season ended abruptly on 1 June 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Željezničar having to settle with a second spot on table. City rivals Sarajevo won the title even though Željezničar won six points from two derby matches played during the league season. In the 2019–20 Bosnian Cup, they finished at the semi-final stage as the competition was cancelled due to the pandemic.

The 2020–21 season started strongly winning four opening matches, however their run in the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League was affected due to the pandemic. The first qualifying round match between Maccabi Haifa, originally scheduled to be played on 27 August 2020 was postponed due to five members from Željezničar&#x27;s delegation testing positive for COVID-19 and the whole team being put into quarantine by the Israeli authorities. Originally six players earlier tested positive and did not travel, being left in Sarajevo. The team returned to Sarajevo before UEFA made a decision to finally play the match on 9 September at Sammy Ofer Stadium in Haifa. Željezničar traveled again but lost 1–3 (thus eliminated after revised rules due to the pandemic) after being in quarantine 9 days prior with little to no training and no competitive matches since shock loss at home to Mladost Doboj Kakanj in the 5th round on 21 August of the 2020–21 Bosnian Premier League season. In the middle of an eight-game winless run in the 2020–21 league season, which had culminated with a home draw against Mladost Doboj Kakanj, Amar Osim was sacked by the club on 11 April 2021. After Osim got sacked on 11 April, three days later, on 14 April, Blaž Slišković was named as Željezničar&#x27;s new manager.

On 18 June 2021, after Slišković left the club, Croatian manager Tomislav Ivković became the new manager of Željezničar. In January 2022, after he left the club, Ivković was replaced by Edis Mulalić.

==Stadium==


The club had no stadium upon its foundation as other clubs would not allow Željezničar to use the existing football grounds in Sarajevo. The club played their first matches at a military training pitch called Egzercir which wasn&#x27;t actually a football ground, however, it was the best ground available and will always be remembered as the club&#x27;s first pitch. Egzercir was located in a part of Sarajevo known as Čengić vila. In 1932, a new ground was built in Pofalići (yet another part of Sarajevo), close to the railway station. It wasn&#x27;t much better than the last one, but it was built by the club and because of that it had a special meaning.

After World War II, Željezničar played at the &quot;6th April&quot; Stadium in Marijin Dvor (there is a building now on the spot, behind the technical sciences secondary school) until 18 June 1950. Authorities planned to build a street, so the club made another move to military stadium in Skenderija. Club staff was tired of all that moving and they decided to build its own stadium in Grbavica neighborhood which just started to be redeveloped and urbanized. Friends, supporters, members of the club and even military, all helped in construction. Stadium was officially opened on 13 September 1951 with the second league match between Željezničar and Šibenik. Željezničar won 4–1.

Ever since, Grbavica has been a place of joy and sorrow for the club and its supporters. Symbolically, the old railway line passed over the hill behind the stadium, and every time a train went by during a match it would sound its whistle to salute the fans. The stadium had a south side and a small east side while a wooden grandstand with a roof was on the west side. The grandstand was relocated from the &quot;6th April&quot; Stadium on the same year when Željezničar moved. Because of the reconstruction, Željezničar moved again in 1968 to Koševo Stadium and even won the club&#x27;s only Yugoslav title in 1972 playing there.

Grbavica was reopened yet again on 25 April 1976, and in 1986 a modern northern stand was added which is still in use. Unfortunately, war began in spring 1992 and Željezničar was forced, yet again, to play on Koševo Stadium until 1996 when it came back to Grbavica. During the 1990s war, the stadium suffered heavy structural damage. The stadium was located between the first front lines and endured heavy fighting. Bosnian Serbs&#x27; forces burned down the wooden grandstand under which all the club facilities were located consequently burning down most of the club&#x27;s records and trophies in the process as well. It was not until 2 May 1996 that a football match would be played on Grbavica Stadium again. Symbolically, the first match after the war was the Sarajevo derby. The wooden grandstand that burned up during the war was never fully reconstructed and on its place, on the west side of the stadium, a much smaller wooden stand was built under which, yet again, all the club facilities are located. In 2016, the wooden stand was reconstructed and slightly expanded in a way that all the wood elements were replaced with anti-slip metal in order to meet the UEFA Stadium requirements.

Before the war capacity of the stadium was more than 20,000 unseated, but now it officially has 13,146 seated places with room for around 4,000 more patrons in standing areas.

==Name of the club==
Željezničar was formed as RŠD Željezničar (Radničko športsko društvo, eng. Workers&#x27; sports society). Željezničar means railwayman or railway worker. Later it was known as FK Željezničar (Fudbalski klub, eng. football club), and was a part of SD Željezničar (Sportsko društvo, eng. sports society) which includes the clubs in other sports (basketball, handball, volleyball, chess, bowling, etc.) with the same name. In 1993, the initial acronym was changed to NK (Nogometni klub, eng. football club). In Bosnian, both &quot;fudbal&quot; and &quot;nogomet&quot; are equally used as a word for football. The word &quot;fudbal&quot; is dominant in the eastern and northern parts of the country, while &quot;nogomet&quot; is more used in its western parts. Since 2000, the club has officially been using the initial FK in its name.

In modern times, there is a restaurant named after the club&#x27;s name. Such example is a &quot;ćevapi&quot;the national dishrestaurant in Baščaršija, Sarajevo&#x27;s ood bazaar, called &quot;Ćevabdžinica &quot;Željo&quot;&quot;.

==Colours==
Blue is traditionally colour of railway workers in this part of Europe. Since the club was founded by the railway workers, blue was a logical choice. Standard navy blue colour was always on the club&#x27;s crest, but it is a different story with kits. Sometimes they were light blue, sometimes regular blue, and sometimes navy blue as it is on the crest. Sometimes kits were blue and white vertical striped. For some games in 1999–00 season, kits were striped horizontally, and in 2002–03 season they were even dark grey, without any traces of blue. Away kit was always white.

On the left side of the kit, by the heart, stands a crest. Since the foundation of the club, standard elements of the crest were ball and wings, also a traditional railway symbol. These standard elements were changed in design several times in the past. Some other elements were added or excluded in some periods of history. For example, circle around the original crest was added in the 1990s. From 1945. to 1992. red five-pointed star stood in place of the ball, and words &quot;Sarajevo&quot;, &quot;1921&quot; and others were moved form one part of the crest to another many times. Current design dates back to 2000.

==Supporters==
FK Željezničar main supporter group are called The Maniacs. There is also subgroups like Blue Tigers, Joint Union, Urban Corps, Stari Grad and Vendetta.

In popular culture, Stole Anđelović (&quot;Stole iz Bora&quot;) – a passionate club supporter from Bor, Serbia, is known decades (over 40 years) for traveling 450 km to attend most FK Željezničar Sarajevo home games, and was a long time supporter of Yugoslav national team as well as fan of Ivica Osim.

A passionate group of fans from 1921.ba TV upload regular Željezničar league and European match reports as well as interviews with players and staff to online stream media; &quot;YouTube&quot;.

==Rivalries==
===Sarajevo derby (&quot;Vječiti derbi&quot;)===
Željezničar has a fierce rivalry with their city-rivals Sarajevo, which is known as the Sarajevo derby, the biggest derby in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is contested regularly since both teams are part of the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

During the 2015–16 season the club beat Sarajevo both home at Grbavica and away, a first time the club has beaten Sarajevo away at Koševo in 12 years.

During the 2017–18 league season, Željezničar beat Sarajevo in 3 out of 4 league matches, the most in one season and didn&#x27;t even lose that season as there was also 1 draw.

During the 2018–19 league season, Željezničar lost against Sarajevo in 2 out of 3 league matches, the most in one season and didn&#x27;t even win that season as there was also 1 draw. The most recent match was played on 22 February 2025, where Željezničar and Sarajevo drew 0–0 at Grbavica.

===Željezničar – Borac Banja Luka rivalry===
Also another notable rivalry started to shape in recent years. Since the season 2008–09, the time when Borac started to be standard in the Premier League once again, a great rivalry started to develop between the two teams. Starting from the 2009–10 season the two teams mainly competed against each other for one of the titles (the league title or national cup) and even the attendance almost got on pair with the Sarajevo derby. The rivalry also has a root in the fact that Sarajevo and Banja Luka are, by a good margin, the two biggest cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first being also the capital of the whole country while the second takes the role as the de facto capital of Republika Srpska entity. Since independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina the teams met each other 22 times (6 of which are in national cup), although they played the first time against each other in 1947 Yugoslav Cup. In those 22 matches, Željezničar won 12 times, while Borac managed to win 7 times, with 3 matches ending in a draw. The goal difference is 31:19 in favor of Željezničar (Not including results from 2015 to 2016 season).

<text>Kimberlin Ann Brown (born June 29, 1961) is an American actress, business owner, and politician. She portrayed Sheila Carter on the CBS daytime soap operas &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (1990 to 1992, 2005 to 2006) and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (off and on from 1992 to the present). She received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress for her role as Sheila on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in 1993 and was nominated in the same category for &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in 2022.

== Early life ==
Brown was born in Hayward, California and raised in La Mesa, near San Diego. Her parents divorced when she was in junior high school. She enjoyed spending summers at her grandparents&#x27; ranch in Northern California. She attended Grossmont High School and Grossmont College.

==Career==

=== 1979-1989: Early work ===
In 1979, Brown entered the Miss La Mesa pageant on a dare. To her surprise, she won. She was named first runner up in the Miss California pageant later that year. Brown caught the attention of Nina Blanchard, a modeling agent who judged the pageant. Blanchard signed her as a client and soon after, she was modeling in Tokyo, Milan, and Paris.

Unsatisfied with modeling, Brown became interested in acting. She made her television debut in an episode of the ABC series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. She then went on to guest star on &quot;Matt Houston, T.J. Hooker,&quot; and &quot;Hawaiian Heat&quot;. Her early film credits include &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;,&quot;18 Again!, and Back to School.&quot; Brown had a brief role on &quot;Capitol&quot; in 1987.

=== 1990-2003: &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; and &quot;B&amp;B&quot; ===
Brown had a short term role on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; in 1990. She was then cast as Sheila Carter on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (after originally auditioning for the role of Cassandra Rawlins). In 1992, it was announced that her character, Sheila, would move to &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. She received a 1993 Daytime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Supporting Actress for playing Sheila on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She continued to play the role on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; until 1998.

She had a role in the 1992 film &quot;The Opposite Sex and How to Live with Them&quot; and guest starred on in 1997.

Brown had a short term role as Shelly Clark on the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; in 1999. She then joined the cast of the ABC soap opera &quot;Port Charles&quot; as Rachel Locke, from July 1999 to November 2000. She made return appearances to the show in 2001 and 2002. Brown and her &quot;Port Charles&quot; co-star, Nolan North, guest starred in two episodes of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, playing soap opera actors.

In 2003, Brown appeared in the film &quot;Becoming Marty&quot;. She then returned to &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, once again playing Sheila Carter.

=== 2004-2008: &quot;One Life to Live, Return to Y&amp;R&quot; ===
After a brief return to &quot;B&amp;B&quot;, she was cast in the recurring role of Dr. Paige Miller on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in October 2004. The role was originally intended for Mary Beth Evans, who turned it down when she decided to stay on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. When Brown was offered a contract, she decided to leave, not pleased with the salary offered or the possibility of relocating to New York. She continued to air on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; until July 2005.

In 2005, Brown returned as Sheila on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; after a long absence from the show. In early 2006, she was released from her contract on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. When her character returned later that year, the role was played by Michelle Stafford, because Sheila had undergone plastic surgery to look like Stafford&#x27;s character, Phyllis Summers.

Brown had a role in the 2008 film, &quot;Proud American&quot;. 

=== 2010-present ===
Brown was asked to return to &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; early in 2010 for a storyline that was subsequently dropped. She took on a short-term role on &quot;All My Children&quot; in October 2010, playing the Judge who presided over David Hayward&#x27;s murder trial. 

In 2011, Brown was cast in Gregori J. Martin&#x27;s web-series &quot;The Bay.&quot; She first appeared in a summer special, &quot;Far From The Bay&quot;, and continued on in the series&#x27; second season. She starred in a short film, &quot;The Necklace&quot;, and co-starred with Tom Sizemore in the 2013 film &quot;Five Hour Friends&quot;.

In June 2017, it was announced that Brown would return to &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; as Sheila. That same year, she joined the cast of &quot;The Rich and the Ruthless&quot;, a comedic series written and produced by her former &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; co-star, Victoria Rowell.

After departing &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in 2018, Brown returned once again as Sheila in 2021. She received a 2022 Daytime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Supporting Actress for her role as Sheila. Her storyline seemed to reach a final conclusion in 2024, when Sheila was stabbed to death by Steffy Forrester. Brown confirmed that Sheila was really dead. It was soon announced that Sheila was still alive, because Steffy had stabbed her look alike, Sugar, instead.

== Politics ==
Brown is a Republican. In 2016, Brown was a speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention on the night Donald Trump was officially nominated as the party&#x27;s candidate for President of the United States. After her speech, Brown got extremely emotional to Fox Business Network over what her vocal support for Donald Trump and his policies might do to her career and the treatment she had received since it was announced she would be a speaker at the convention.

In October 2017, Brown formally announced her candidacy as a Republican for California&#x27;s 36th congressional district, challenging Democrat Raul Ruiz in the November 2018 election. She lost the election, receiving 41% of the vote to Ruiz&#x27;s 59%.

==Personal life==
Brown met her husband, Gary Pelzer, when she was thirteen and he was twenty-two. They began a relationship when she was eighteen, but eventually broke up. They reunited in 1990 and married on May 11, 1991. They have a daughter and a son. They became grandparents in 2024.

Her daughter, Alexes Marie Pelzer, guest starred on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in 2022.

Brown and Pelzer are small-business owners; they own and run an avocado farm in California. Brown also has a design business, K. Brown Design, which she launched in 2006.

She is a skier and an avid golfer. In 2014, Brown became an International Ambassador for Project Golf, a non-profit that helps underprivileged youth play golf.

<text>Peter Anthony Salisbury (born 24 September 1971) is an English rock drummer, best known as the drummer for The Verve, whom he co-founded in 1990.

== The Verve ==
The Verve reunited in June 2007 for a new tour and a future album. Salisbury is believed to have been the one behind getting the ball rolling in terms of reuniting the band. After Ashcroft learned that Salisbury was in contact with the former guitarist, Nick McCabe, over a possible side project, Ashcroft used this as an excuse to call McCabe. Ashcroft made peace with him and bassist Simon Jones and the band reformed. In a band interview with the &quot;NME&quot; in 2007, Salisbury said that the problems between them were not that bad in the first place.

== Other musical projects ==
After the band&#x27;s second demise in 1999, Salisbury played with various bands including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. He filled in on a UK/EU tour in 2002, when their original drummer Nick Jago could not get a working visa for BRMC&#x27;s British gigs. Salisbury owned and ran a drum shop, &quot;Drummin&quot;, in Stockport, England. He played drums on the first three of Richard Ashcroft&#x27;s solo albums.

Following the Verve&#x27;s third demise in 2008, in October 2010, Salisbury played drums on The Charlatans UK tour, while their regular drummer Jon Brookes was undergoing treatment for a brain tumour. Brookes died in 2013, and Salisbury has continued to work as The Charlatans drummer since then, though he has not been made a full member of the band.

<doc id="828194" wikidata="Q77373" url="?curid=828194" title="Johannes Liechtenauer">
<text>Johannes Liechtenauer (also &quot;Lichtnauer&quot;, &quot;Hans Lichtenawer&quot;) was a German fencing master who had a great level of influence on the German fencing tradition in the 14th century.

== Biography ==

Liechtenauer seems to have been active during the mid-to-late 14th century.
The only extant biographical note on Liechtenauer is found in GNM Hs. 3227a (dated c. 1400), which states that &quot;Master Liechtenauer learnt and mastered [the art of the sword] in a thorough and rightful way, but he did not invent it or make it up himself, as it is stated before. Instead, he travelled across and visited many lands for the sake of this rightful and true art, as he wanted to study and know it.&quot;

His surname indicates he was from a place called &quot;Liechtenau&quot; (modern &quot;Lichtenau&quot;).
There are several places with this name. Massmann (1844)
mentions five candidate locations:
Lichtenau im Mühlkreis in Upper Austria;
Lichtenau in Franconia, Nuremberg;
Lichtenau on the Rhine, Baden, near Strasbourg;
Lichtenau in Hesse;
and Lichtenau in Westphalia, near Paderborn.
Of these he treats as the most likely Franconian Lichtenau, because Nuremberg was a center of later (Renaissance-era) fencing, and Lichtenau in Upper Austria, because of the geographical provenance suggested by the members of the &quot;Society of Liechtenauer&quot;.

== The Zettel (epitome) ==
Liechtenauer&#x27;s students preserved his teaching in the form of a mnemonic poem (called the &quot;Zettel&quot;, Early New High German &quot;zedel&quot;, a German word corresponding to English &quot;schedule&quot;, in the sense of &quot;brief written summary&quot;; translated &quot;epitome&quot; by Tobler 2010). Later in the 15th century, parts of these verses become widely known, and by the 16th century are incorporated into the general tradition of German fencing.

The term &quot;zedel&quot; is used in the manuscripts associated with the &quot;Society of Liechtenauer&quot; in the mid-15th century. Its earliest known use found in Cod. 44 A 8 (dated 1452, fol. 9v):
:&quot;Alhÿe hebt sich an dye zedel der Ritterlichen kunst des fechtens dye do geticht vnd gemacht hat Johans Liechtenawer der ain hocher maister In den künsten gewesen ist dem got genadig seÿ&quot;
:&quot;Here begin the &quot;zedel&quot; of the knightly art of fencing, which were composed and made by Johannes Liechtenauer, who was a high master in the arts, and on whom God may have mercy.&quot;

The &quot;Zettel&quot; were apparently intended as a list of mnemonic aids to help the student remember concepts he had been taught orally. They do not &quot;explain&quot; the technique in any detail. On the contrary, the verses are intentionally cryptic and are described as &quot;secret and hidden words&quot; by later masters, who assure us that their opaque wording was intended to prevent the uninitiated from discovering the techniques described therein.
These verses were treated as the core of the art by Liechtenauer&#x27;s followers, and the earliest fencing manuals of the Liechtenauer school, beginning with Hs. 3227a and followed by the treatises of Peter von Danzig zum Ingolstadt, Jud Lew, and Sigmund Schining ein Ringeck in the 15th century, are organized such that each couplet or quatrain is given first, followed by a gloss or detailed explanation of its intended meaning.

The Zettel are organized as follows:

* a general introduction to the art of fighting
* a general introduction to fighting with the long sword (the sword held with both hands on the grip)
* a division into seventeen parts or techniques (also known as Liechtenauer&#x27;s &quot;17 chief pieces&quot; or &quot;Hauptstücke&quot;) of fighting with the long sword.

The general introduction is ethical as well as practical and begins as follows:
Liechtenauer&#x27;s seventeen &quot;chief pieces&quot; (&quot;Hauptstücke&quot;) are:
*five &quot;master strikes&quot; or &quot;hidden strikes&quot;: 1. Zornhau, 2. Krumphau, 3. Zwerchhau, 4. Schielhau, 5. Scheitelhau
*the four guards (&quot;Huten&quot; or &quot;Leger&quot;), called &quot;plough&quot; (&quot;Pflug&quot;), &quot;ox&quot; (&quot;Ochs&quot;), &quot;vom tag&quot; and &quot;the fool&quot; (&quot;Alber&quot;).
*a list of techniques: &quot;Versetzen&quot;, &quot;Nachreisen&quot;, &quot;Überlaufen&quot;, &quot;Absetzen&quot;, &quot;Durchwechseln&quot;, &quot;Zucken&quot;, &quot;Durchlaufen&quot; (grappling), &quot;Abschneiden&quot;, &quot;Händedrücken&quot; four &quot;Hängen&quot;, twenty-four &quot;Winden&quot;.

Liechtenauer is also cited as the originator of similar teachings in other disciplines, including fighting on horseback armored dueling or &quot;Kampffechten&quot; and wrestling, besides fragmentary allusions to other material, such as fighting with the dagger, the messer and the small shield, in ms. 3227a. Liechtenauer&#x27;s actual authorship of this material is however doubtful.
It seems more likely that Liechtenauer&#x27;s contribution is limited to the unarmoured fencing with the long sword, while other masters specialized in other disciplines; the verses on armoured and mounted combat are likely due to Andreas Liegnitzer, Martin Hundsfeld or Jud Lew, while the verses on wrestling are mostly attributed to Ott Jud.

In addition to the &quot;Zettel&quot; on mounted fencing, several treatises in the Liechtenauer tradition include a group of twenty-six &quot;figures&quot;—single line abbreviations of select couplets and quatrains that seem to summarize them. A parallel set of teachings was recorded by Andre Paurñfeyndt in 1516 called the &quot;Twelve Teachings for the Beginning Fencer&quot;., These teachings are also generally abbreviations of longer passages from the long sword &quot;Zettel&quot;, and are similarly repeated in many treatises throughout the 16th century. Thus, it may be that the figures are a mnemonic that represent the initial stage of mounted fencing instruction, and that the full verse was learned only afterward.

== Society of Liechtenauer ==

The Society of Liechtenauer (&quot;Geselschaft Liechtenauers&quot;) is a list of seventeen masters found in the introduction to the three oldest copies of Paulus Kal&#x27;s fencing manual. It is unclear if this was ever a formal organization or what its nature might have been; however, it is commonly speculated that the list is a memorial to deceased students and associates of the grand master. Of particular interest is the international nature of the list, including masters from present-day Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland, which parallels the statement in the MS 3227a that Liechtenauer himself traveled to many lands to learn the art. Several masters from this list are known to have written fencing treatises, but about half remain completely unknown.

Paulus Kal lists the members of the Society as follows:

<text>Alexander Logie du Toit FRS ( ; 14 March 1878 – 25 February 1948) was a geologist from South Africa and an early supporter of Alfred Wegener&#x27;s theory of continental drift.

==Early life and education==
Du Toit was born in Newlands, Cape Town in 1878, and educated at the Diocesan College in Rondebosch and the University of the Cape of Good Hope. Encouraged by his grandfather, Captain Alexander Logie, he graduated in 1899 in mining engineering at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow. After a short period studying geology at the Royal College of Science in London, he returned to Glasgow to lecture in geology, mining and surveying at the University of Glasgow and the Royal Technical College.

==Career==
In 1903, du Toit was appointed as a geologist within the Geological Commission of the Cape of Good Hope, and he began to develop an extensive knowledge of the geology of southern Africa by mapping large portions of the Karoo and its dolerite intrusions, publishing numerous papers on the subject. Subsequently, he mapped the entire Karoo System through the complete stratigraphy from Dwyka tillite to the basalt of the Drakensberg. He worked at a furious rate but was known for his painstaking meticulousness, as reflected in his 1937 book &quot;Our Wandering Continents&quot;. It still bears reading for its creative and closely argued theses in the light of the geology of the day, and is soberingly consistent with modern principles of plate tectonics.

In 1920, du Toit joined the Union Irrigation Department as water geologist, and in 1927, he became chief consulting geologist to De Beers Consolidated Mines until his retirement in 1941.

In 1923, he received a grant from the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and used this to travel to eastern South America to study the geology of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. As is apparent from his remarks in &quot;Our Wandering Continents&quot;, he had requested support for the expedition not on a whim but specifically to test his predictions of correspondences between the geology of both continents. In the event, he was able to demonstrate and follow the predicted continuation of specific features that he had already documented in Southern Africa, into the continent of South America. Although it might perhaps seem less impressive to the layman, that evidence was far more convincing to the geologist than was the matching of continental shelves.

In the light of his research, du Toit published a review of the stratigraphic and radioisotope evidence from those regions that supported Wegener&#x27;s ideas, &quot;A Geological Comparison of South America with South Africa&quot; (1927). His best-known publication, &quot;Our Wandering Continents&quot; (1937), expanded and improved this work and, departing somewhat from Wegener, proposed two original supercontinents separated by the Tethys Ocean, a northern/equatorial Laurasia and a southern/polar Gondwanaland.

==Awards and honours==
In 1933, du Toit was awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society of London, and in 1943, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1949, the year after his death, the Geological Society of South Africa inaugurated a biennial lecture series in his honour that continues to the present day.

In 1973, a 75 km crater on Mars (71.8°S, 49.7°W) was named &quot;Du Toit&quot; in recognition of his work.

<text>Anneli Magnusson, known by her stage names Pandora and United DJs vs. Pandora, is a Swedish Eurodance singer.

== Musical career ==

Magnusson grew up with her family outside of Västerås. She learned to play the guitar at an early age. In her teenage years, Magnusson started performing on stage, playing acoustic versions of songs and she could also be seen with different bands, mostly singing rock covers. She was accepted into the musical college Carlforsska, and it was here where she met Henrik Andersson, Martin Ankelius and Peka P. known as Hit Vision. Hit Vision were looking for &#x27;a girl with an attitude in her voice, someone who could sing their melodic dance music&#x27;. In 1993, Magnusson and Hit Vision moved to Stockholm and signed with Virgin Records. In October 1993, her debut single &quot;Trust Me&quot; was released under the artist name Pandora. &quot;Trust Me&quot; became the best-selling local single of the year and went gold. Her debut studio album &quot;One of a Kind&quot;, was released in November 1993, bringing the singer further fame and achieving gold status in both Sweden and Finland and making Pandora the best-selling dance act in Scandinavia (Fennoscandia). &quot;Come On And Do It&quot; was released in December 1993 and also peaked in the top 5 in Finland and Sweden.

In February 1995, Pandora&#x27;s second album &quot;Tell the World&quot; was released. In Scandinavia sales of the album again exceeded the 100,000 mark. In addition, Japanese audiences turned out to be very enthusiastic about Pandora. &quot;Tell the World&quot; selling more than 1 million albums in Asia alone.

Pandora&#x27;s third album &quot;Changes&quot; was released in December 1996. It was Pandora&#x27;s debut release with her new record company Universal Music. Sticking to the motto &quot;never change a winning team&quot;, Pandora once again collaborated with her creative trio of Ankelius/Andersson/Johansson. Pandora toured through Scandinavia in the spring and summer of 1997 and did her first 2-week live tour through the main cities of Japan. In December 1997, &quot;This Could Be Heaven&quot; was released. The album went platinum in Japan within six weeks. Pandora had written three of the songs herself on this album. In 1998, Pandora released &quot;Spirit to Win&quot; which was the official track of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. In February 1999, Pandora released &quot;Breathe&quot; and a similar album released as &quot;Blue&quot; in Australia. &quot;No Regrets&quot;, was recorded between August and November 1999 and was released in end of 1999. It included the track &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;.

Pandora&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;A Little Closer&quot; was released in 2001, but failed to chart. &quot;Won&#x27;t Look Back&quot; was released in 2002. In 2003, Pandora competed in the Melodifestivalen 2003 with the song &quot;You&quot;. The track failed to make it past the heats. Later in 2003, Pandora released her ninth studio album, &quot;9 Lives&quot;, which peaked on the Swedish chart at 16. In 2004, Pandora competed again in the Melodifestivalen 2004 with the song &quot;Runaway&quot;. The track also failed to make it past the heats.

On 28 March 2007, Pandora accused British Eurovision act Scooch of having plagiarized her 1999 song &quot;No Regrets&quot; and planned to file a complaint with the EBU. In response to the plagiarism claim, BBC issued a statement saying that Scooch&#x27;s song is &quot;an original&quot; and the writers &quot;were never aware of Pandora or her songs&quot;. BBC confirmed that there had been no duplication of her work.

In November 2007, Pandora released the album, &quot;Celebration&quot; with United DJs. The album was a collaboration with selected DJs in the recording studio, re-recording and remixing her biggest hits. The album peaked at number 38 in Sweden. In November 2011, Pandora released her tenth studio album, &quot;Head Up High&quot;.

In spring 2020, Pandora participated in the Finnish version of the TV show &quot;Masked Singer&quot; as the Peacock. The next year, she entered &quot;Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu&quot;, the Finnish selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, singing the song &quot;I Love You&quot; with the Teflon Brothers where they came in 2nd place behind Blind Channel.

==Personal life==
Magnusson has a son with whom she lives in Sweden. She also has an apartment in Vantaa, Finland, with Finnish former ice hockey player , to whom she got engaged in 2014.

<text>The Hawaii State Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) is the intermediate appellate court of the Hawaii State Judiciary. It has jurisdiction over appeals from lower courts and agencies.

The ICA is composed of one chief judge and six associate judges, who sit in randomly selected panels of three. Each judge is appointed to an initial ten-year term by the Governor. Judges are nominated by the Governor from a list of four to six names submitted by the Judicial Selection Commission. A judge&#x27;s nomination is subject to confirmation by the Hawaii Senate, but reappointments require only approval of the Judicial Selection Commission. Under article VI, §3 of the Hawaii Constitution, all judges of the Intermediate Court of Appeals, like the justices of the Supreme Court of Hawaii and the judges of the Hawaii State Circuit Courts, have a mandatory retirement age of 70.

==History==
The Intermediate Court of Appeals was established in 1979. The court consisted of one chief judge and two associate judges. Annual salary of the chief judge was set at $45,000 and the associates judges were set at $43,750. The court shared concurrent jurisdiction with the Hawaii Supreme Court.

Originally, Hawaii adopted the so-called &quot;push-down&quot; or &quot;deflective&quot; model of appellate procedure still used in a small number of other states. Following judgment or appropriate agency decision, a party filed an application for writ of certiorari with the Hawaii Supreme Court. Following granting of a writ of certiorari, the Hawaii Supreme Court would then assign the case to the Intermediate Court of Appeals or to itself. The Hawaii Supreme Court could also reassign a case to itself under limited circumstances.

In 1992, the court expanded to one chief judge and three associate judges.

In 2001, the court expanded to one chief judge and five associate judges.

In 2004, Hawaii changed its appellate procedure so that all appeals from the lower courts and agency decisions would now go directly to the Intermediate Court of Appeals, meaning that court would normally be the first to rule on the merits of an appeal. However, a party could still submit an application to transfer a case to the Hawaii Supreme Court upon the grounds of a question of imperative or fundamental public importance; an appeal from a decision of any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law invalidating an amendment to the state constitution or determining a state statute, county ordinance, or agency rule to be invalid on the grounds that it was invalidly enacted or is unconstitutional, on its face or as applied, under either the constitution of the State or the United States; or a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

For the 2016-2017 state fiscal year, the budget for the Hawaii Supreme Court and the Intermediate Court of Appeals was approximately $6.7 million.

In 2022, the court expanded to one chief judge and six associate judges.

==Salaries==
The Commission on Salaries has recommend the following salaries for the chief judge and the associate judges:

<text>The Land Court of the State of Hawaii (originally, the Court of Land Registration in the former U.S. Territory of Hawaii) has exclusive jurisdiction in the Hawaii State Judiciary over cases involving registered land titles. The Land Court system of land registration was created by statute in 1903 as a Torrens system of land titles.

Registration of land in Land Court is optional in Hawaii; non-registered land is conveyed in the &quot;Regular System&quot; instead, by recording deeds or other documents in the Bureau of Conveyances. Land in the Regular System may be lost by adverse possession (including squatter&#x27;s rights, encroachments, and public trespassing) but land with registered title cannot be lost by adverse possession or other prescriptive means. &quot;&#x27;No title, right or interest in, to or across registered land in derogation of that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession&#x27;. Thus is the possession of registered land protected. It cannot be interrupted by an adverse entry.&quot;

In order to register a parcel of land in Land Court for the first time, an application with supporting documents proving good title is filed with the court. If successful, the Land Court issues an Original Certificate of Title, and issues Transfer Certificates of Title for all subsequent valid transfers. Notice of liens, mortgages, long-term leases, easements, servitudes or other encumbrances on the land is recorded on the Certificate of Title.

The application is formally a legal case in a court of record, with required notice to all affected persons, and rights of appeal. Registered title to land is guaranteed by the State (and a special trust fund) to be solid (&quot;good against the whole world&quot;) and is rarely challenged. Original applications to register new land parcels have become rare in Hawaii in recent years. It is possible, under a Hawaii statute, to take land out of the Land Court system into the Regular System.

The Land Court staff certifies transfers of land title under the Torrens system; the court presides over disputed titles and rights to registered land. The Land Court is administered by a Registrar, an Assistant Registrar, and the Judge of the Land Court, who is a judge of the First Circuit (Honolulu) assigned to the Land Court.

On Lānai Island, almost all land has been registered in Land Court, while very little of nearby Molokai Island is registered. Palmyra Island was registered in Land Court in 1912, and land parcels there were subdivided and transferred in that system until 1959, when the rest of the Territory of Hawaii, excluding Palmyra and the Stewart Islands, became the State of Hawaii (Hawaii Admission Act). The Land Court became a state court and lost jurisdiction over Palmyra land because Palmyra was left out of the new state, as the remnant of the old federal Territory. (Since 1962, Palmyra land transfers are recorded by the court clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.)

<text>Raszyn () is a village in Pruszków County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of an administrative district called Gmina Raszyn. It lies approximately east of Pruszków and south-west of Warsaw. Raszyn is a part of Warsaw urban area.

==History==

Raszyn has been the site of two battles. On April 19, 1809, the inconclusive Battle of Raszyn (1809) took place between the Polish forces under Prince Józef Poniatowski and the Austrian army under Archduke Ferdinand d&#x27;Este.
In 1931 a longwave broadcasting transmitter was set up in Raszyn. Back then it was the strongest such facility in Europe, with roughly 120 kW of power. During the World War II the radio mast was destroyed, but was rebuilt in 1945 with roughly 500 kW of power. In 1949 a new aerial mast was built there. At 335 metres high, it was until 1962 the tallest structure in Europe. Until the inauguration of the transmitter in Konstantynów in 1974 it served as the central longwave radio facility of the Polish Radio. Until 1978 it served as spare transmitter for Konstantynów. Since 1978 the facility in Raszyn is used at daytime for transmissions of the second programme of the Polish Radio in the longwave range.
After the collapse of the Konstantynów radio mast in 1991, the transmitter in Raszyn yet again became the main broadcasting transmitter in Poland. After completion of the new longwave transmitter in Solec Kujawski in 1999, it was finally switched off in 2009.

Raszyn itself currently functions as a suburb of Warsaw, with many villas and shops located there. The gmina has roughly 20,000 inhabitants and is one of the fastest-developing suburbs of the Polish capital.

Among the notable tourist attractions of the area is a baroque-classicist church from 1645. In 1790 it was refurbished by renowned Polish architect Szymon Bogumił Zug. He also built an inn in the town. Also, in 1978 the &quot;Stawy Raszyńskie&quot; reserve was established for protection of large ponds and the natural habitat of roughly 100 species of birds. The protected area covers 1.1 km2.

<text>The Hawaii state circuit courts are the trial courts of general jurisdiction in Hawaii. They are the primary civil and criminal courts of the Hawaii State Judiciary. The circuit courts are the only Hawaii state courts to conduct jury trials. (The District Courts conduct bench trials while the Intermediate Court of Appeals and Supreme Court are appellate courts).

The circuit courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over probate and guardianship cases, criminal felony cases, and civil cases where the amount in controversy exceeds US$40,000.

The circuit courts are organized into four circuits:

*First: Oahu (based in Honolulu)
*Second: Maui, Molokai, and Lanai (based in Wailuku)
*Third: Hawaii (based in Hilo)
*Fifth: Kauai and Niihau (based in Lihue)

There is currently no Fourth Circuit, because the Fourth Circuit merged into the Third Circuit in 1943.

The largest and most important of the circuit courts is the First Circuit in Honolulu.

The state legislature has created additional statewide courts on paper, but failed to constitute them as actual courts with their own judges, support staff, and courthouses. Instead, judges of the First Circuit serve as the statewide Tax Appeal Court and one judge of the First Circuit serves as the judge of the statewide Land Court.

<text>The Singing Detective is a six-part BBC television serial drama, written by Dennis Potter, starring Michael Gambon and directed by Jon Amiel. Its six episodes are &quot;Skin&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;Lovely Days&quot;, &quot;Clues&quot;, &quot;Pitter Patter&quot; and &quot;Who Done It&quot;.

The serial was broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in 1986 on Sunday nights from 16 November to 21 December, with later PBS and cable television showings in the United States. It won a Peabody Award in 1989. It ranks 20th on the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, as voted by industry professionals in 2000. It was included in the 1992 Dennis Potter retrospective at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio and became a permanent addition to the museum&#x27;s collections in New York and Los Angeles. There was co-production funding from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The series was released on DVD in the US on 15 April 2003 and in the UK on 8 March 2004. It was also screened in the UK on BBC iPlayer until November 2024.

== Plot ==
Mystery writer Philip E. Marlow is suffering writer&#x27;s block and is hospitalized because his psoriatic arthropathy, a chronic skin and joint disease, is at an acute stage, forming lesions and sores over his entire body and partially crippling his hands and feet. Dennis Potter suffered from this disease and he wrote with a pen tied to his fist in much the same fashion Marlow does in the last episode. (Although severe, Marlow&#x27;s condition was intentionally understated compared to Potter&#x27;s, whose skin would sometimes crack and bleed.)

As a result of constant pain, a fever caused by the condition and his refusal to take medication, Marlow falls into a fantasy world involving his Chandleresque novel &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;, an escapist and noir adventure about a detective (also named &quot;Philip Marlow&quot;) who sings at a dance hall and takes the jobs refused by &quot;the guys who don&#x27;t sing&quot;. Marlow is &quot;plot-dreaming&quot;, trying out various solutions to a working plot in his head, deciding as he goes what plot element works best with what character or situation, interspersed with bits of ideas that occur to him off the top of his head and discarding (with some afterthoughts) parts of his story that no longer work when other changes have been made.

The real Marlow also experiences flashbacks to his childhood in rural England and his mother&#x27;s life in wartime London. The rural location is the Forest of Dean, Potter&#x27;s birthplace and the location for filming, referred to as &#x27;the Forest.&#x27; The suicide of his mother is one of several recurring images in the series; Marlow uses it (whether subconsciously or not) in his murder mystery and sometimes replaces her face with different women in his life, real and imaginary. The noir mystery is never solved; all that is ultimately revealed is an intentionally vague plot involving smuggled Nazi war criminals being protected by the Allies and Soviet agents attempting to stop them. This perhaps reflects Marlow&#x27;s view that fiction should be &quot;all clues and no solutions&quot;.

The three worlds of the hospital, the noir thriller and wartime England often merge in Marlow&#x27;s mind, resulting in a fourth layer, in which character relationships that would otherwise be impossible (e.g., fictional characters interacting with non-fictional characters) occur. This is evident in that characters in the novel represent many of Marlow&#x27;s friends and enemies (perceived or otherwise), particularly Raymond, Marlow&#x27;s mother&#x27;s lover, who appears as the antagonist in the &quot;real&quot; and noir worlds (although the &quot;real&quot; Binney/Finney is ultimately a fantasy as well). The use of Binney as a villain stems from the fact that Binney committed adultery with Marlow&#x27;s mum and simultaneously (and perhaps publicly) cuckolded Marlow&#x27;s dad, whom Marlow loved. Marlow&#x27;s guilt at his apparent belief that he caused his parents&#x27; separation and even his mother&#x27;s suicide is exacerbated by his early childhood memory when he framed young Mark Binney for defecating on the desk of a disciplinarian elementary teacher (Janet Henfrey). The innocent Binney is brutally beaten in front of the classroom and Marlow is lauded for telling the &quot;truth&quot;. These events haunt Marlow and one of the shadowy villains who apparently is determined to kill Marlow looks very much like an adult version of the real child, Mark Binney. The real Mark Binney eventually ends up in a mental institution, as Marlow confesses later to the psychiatrist. The villainous Binney/Finney character is killed off in both realities. It is suggested that in each reality, the guilt of Binney/Finney/Mark is entirely the product of Marlow&#x27;s imagination as, in one case, Finney, the wife&#x27;s lover, does not exist. In the other, it is the name of the character Marlow chooses as the guilty party and the boy&#x27;s guilt is a lie told by Marlow to his teacher. In the end, Marlow chooses a killer, who looks more like adult Binney, to live and himself to die, thus showing growth. Janet Henfrey has previously played the same character in Potter&#x27;s earlier TV play &quot;Stand Up, Nigel Barton&quot;.

Marlow as a boy is played by Lyndon Davies, while William Speakman plays Mark Binney (schoolboy); Davies and Speakman were contemporaries at Chosen Hill School in Gloucestershire, close to Potter&#x27;s birthplace of the Forest of Dean. Some members of the cast play several roles. Marlow and his alter ego, the singing detective, are played by Michael Gambon. Patrick Malahide plays three characters—the contemporary Finney, who Marlow thinks is having an affair with his ex-wife Nicola, played by Janet Suzman; the imaginary Binney, a central character in the murder plot; and Raymond, a friend of Marlow&#x27;s father who has an affair with his mother (Alison Steadman). Steadman plays Marlow&#x27;s mother and the mysterious &quot;Lili&quot;, one of the murder victims. At the end of the serial, Marlow and Nicola appear to have repaired their relationship.

== Production ==
In Potter&#x27;s original script, the hospital scenes and noir scenes were to be shot with television (video) and film cameras respectively, with the period material (Marlow&#x27;s childhood) filmed in black-and-white. All scenes were shot on film, over Potter&#x27;s objections. Potter wanted the hospital scenes to maintain the sensibility of sitcom conventions. Although this was tempered in the final script, some character interactions retain this concept. For example, Mr. Hall and Reginald, who are also intended to serve as a mock chorus for the main action occurring in the hospital.

Originally the title of the series was to be &quot;Smoke Rings&quot;, and the &quot;Singing Detective&quot; noir thriller was to be dropped after the first episode; Potter felt it would not hold the audience&#x27;s attention. The discarded title may have referred to a particular monologue delivered by the hospitalized Marlow in the first episode, which includes the sentiment that, despite everything else, the one thing he really wants is a cigarette. Marlow&#x27;s medical and mental progress is subtly gauged by his ability to reach over to his dresser and get his cigarettes.

=== Sources ===
Borrowing portions of his first novel, &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; (1973), Potter added autobiographical aspects (or, as he put it, deeply &quot;personal&quot; aspects), along with 1940s popular music and the noir style. The result is regarded by some as one of the peaks of 20th-century drama. Marlow&#x27;s hallucinations are not far from the Philip Marlowe in &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot;, the 1944 film adaptation of Raymond Chandler&#x27;s &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;, which stars Dick Powell as Marlowe. Powell himself would later portray a &quot;singing detective&quot; on radio&#x27;s &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;, serenading his girlfriend, Helen Asher (Virginia Gregg), at the end of each episode. A reference is made in the last episode to a novel by Agatha Christie, &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;. This may be meant to suggest that Marlow is an unreliable narrator.

== Influence ==
Although &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; did not meet with spectacular viewing figures, it proved influential within the television industry. The serial met with considerable critical praise in America. Steven Bochco has credited the serial as the chief inspiration for &quot;Cop Rock&quot; (1990), although unlike &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;, Bochco&#x27;s drama features specially recorded musical numbers rather than existing work. The serial was adapted into a 2003 American film featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson, with the locations changed to the United States. The British rock band Elbow took their name from a line in the series that declared elbow the &quot;loveliest word in the English language&quot;.

== Music ==
As well as its dark themes, the series is notable for its use of 1940s music, often incorporated into surreal musical numbers. This is a device Potter used in his earlier miniseries &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;. The main theme music is the classic &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot;, of &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; fame. The upbeat music as the theme for such a dark story is perhaps a reference to Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Third Man&quot;, with a harmonica in the place of a zither (&quot;The Third Man&quot; is indeed referenced in a number of camera shots, according to DVD commentary). Director Jon Amiel compiled and spliced the generic thriller music used throughout the series from 60 library tapes he had brought together.

<text>Maurice du Martheray (1892 – 12 April 1955) was a Swiss physician, amateur astronomer and poet. According to a eulogy published by the Swiss Astronomy Club of Geneva, he was a passionate astronomer ever since becoming a member on 2 February 1910. After graduating as a physician and getting married, he co-founded the Flammarion Astronomical Society of Geneva with Jean-Henri Jehéber and Ami Gandillon in 1923. For the following 32 years, he would passionately develop the activities of the society as secretary general, sometimes even at the expense of his career as a dental surgeon. Maurice du Martheray died suddenly on 12 April 1955 and is resting in the cemetery of Nyon, his birthplace, on the shore of Lake Leman in Switzerland.

During his over 40 years of observations he produced more than 20,000 high resolution pictures of the Sun, and more than 10,000 pictures of the Moon and the planets. After the Swiss Astronomical Society was created in Bern in November 1938, Maurice du Martheray co-edited the first issue of its magazine, ORION with Max Schürer, Privat Dozent at the University of Bern and later Professor of astronomy and director of the Astronomical Institute of the same university; with the serious amateur and producer of the almanac Der Sternenhimmel Robert A. Naef of Zürich; and with Emile Antonin of Geneva. Astronaut Claude Nicollier carried a copy of that issue in the space shuttle Endeavour in December 1993 during the first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission.

A crater on Mars was named in his honor by NASA in 1973.

<doc id="828234" wikidata="Q339668" url="?curid=828234" title="Sam Thompson (outfielder)">
<text>Samuel Luther Thompson (March 5, 1860 – November 7, 1922), nicknamed &quot;Big Sam&quot;, was an American professional baseball player from 1884 to 1898 and with a brief comeback in 1906. At , the Indiana native was one of the larger players of his day and was known for his prominent handlebar mustache. He played as a right fielder in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Wolverines (1885–1888), Philadelphia Phillies (1889–1898) and Detroit Tigers (1906). He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.

Thompson had a .331 career batting average and was one of the most prolific run producers in baseball history. His career run batted in (RBI) to games played ratio of .923 (1,305 RBIs in 1,410 games) remains the highest in major league history. In 1895, Thompson averaged 1.44 RBIs per game, and his 166 RBIs in 1887 (in only 127 games) remained the major league record until 1921 when Babe Ruth collected 168 (albeit in 152 games). Thompson still holds the major league record for most RBIs in a single month with 61 in August 1894 while playing for the Phillies. Manager Bill Watkins in 1922 called Thompson &quot;the greatest natural hitter of all time.&quot;

Defensively, Thompson was known to have one of the strongest arms of any outfielder in the early decades of the game. He still ranks among the all-time major league leaders with 61 double plays from the outfield (16th all time) and 283 outfield assists (12th all time). Thompson also had good speed on the base paths and, in 1889, he became the first major league player to reach 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases in the same season.

== Early years ==
Thompson was born in Danville, Indiana, in 1860. He was the fifth of eleven children born to Jesse and Rebecca Thompson. He was educated at the Danville Graded School. After reaching adulthood, Thompson became employed as a carpenter in Danville. He and five of his brothers also played on a local baseball team known as the Danville Browns.

== Baseball career ==

=== Evansville and Indianapolis ===
In July 1884, Thompson began his professional baseball career at age 24, playing for the Evansville, Indiana, team in the Northwestern League. A scout for Evansville travelled to Danville and was referred to &quot;Big Sam&quot;, who was working on a roof in Stinesville. Thompson was initially reluctant to give up his carpentry career and travel 150 miles to Evansville, but he ultimately agreed to give it a try. Unfortunately, the league folded in early August 1884, after only five games. In five games at Evansville, Thompson compiled a .391 batting average.

Thompson signed with the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the newly formed Western League in 1885. He compiled a .321 average in 30 games with the Hoosiers. He was approached by a Union Association team and offered more money, but in a show of &quot;steadfastness to his word&quot;, Thompson refused the offer and remained with Indianapolis at a pay of $100 per month. The Hoosiers were the dominant team in the Western League, compiling an .880 winning percentage.

=== Detroit Wolverines ===

==== Signing ====

In mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad rush developed to sign the players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included Thompson, Deacon McGuire, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Jim Donnelly, Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey.

Thompson later told the colorful story of his acquisition by Detroit. Detroit sent two representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, principally to sign the Hoosiers&#x27; battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. The Wolverines were outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan but wound up with the Hoosiers&#x27; manager (Bill Watkins) and the rest of the team&#x27;s starting lineup. The only catch was that a 10-day waiting period would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney promptly sent the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. The next morning, the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing trip for them. The players boarded the steamship &quot;Annette&quot; and enjoyed the first day and night of successful fishing. After three days, the players became suspicious, but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would return to Detroit. As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the captain admitted he had been ordered to keep them &quot;out at sea&quot; for 10 days. In another account, Thompson described his 10 days aboard the &quot;Annette&quot; as follows: &quot;We were prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the line of creature comforts you could find packed away on ice. We lived on the best in the market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing poker, chips having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the tenth day, at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and signed us to our contracts.&quot;
The players were only later presented with their accumulated mail which included scores of offers from other clubs. A writer in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; later noted: &quot;Detroit magnates showed some inside baseball brains and great finessing in sending the players away from all tempters for that period when they belonged to no club.&quot;

Regardless of the trickery by Detroit, Thompson considered Detroit to be a mecca. He recalled his first time in 1885 viewing Woodward Avenue with Indianapolis teammate Mox McQuery. They gazed with &quot;open-mouth amazement&quot; at the &quot;wondrous pavements&quot;, having never seen a street as &quot;clean and smooth as a table.&quot;

==== 1885 and 1886 seasons ====
Thompson joined the Wolverines lineup in early July. In his first plate appearance, he had a hit off New York Giants&#x27; Hall of Fame pitcher Tim Keefe. The Wolverines were in last place when Thompson joined the club, but won 12 of their first 13 games after Thompson took over in right field. Thompson compiled a .303 batting average in 63 games. Despite playing only the second half of his rookie season, Thompson ranked among the National League leaders with seven home runs (third most in the league) and nine triples (10th most in the league). Displaying a strong arm that would be one of the main features of his defensive game, Thompson also ranked fifth in the league with 24 outfield assists in only 63 games.

In 1886, team owner Frederick K. Stearns made a big splash when he purchased the Buffalo infield that had become known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;, consisting of Dan Brouthers, Hardy Richardson, Jack Rowe, and Deacon White. In addition, Detroit pitcher Lady Baldwin won 42 games in 1886, a major league record for a left-handed pitcher. The 1886 season was Thompson&#x27;s first full season in the majors. Thompson made a major contribution to the 1886 club as well, compiling a .310 batting average with 101 runs scored, 13 triples, and eight home runs in 122 games. His 89 runs batted in (RBIs) ranked third in the National League. His defensive statistics continued to impress as well. He led the league with 11 double plays from the outfield, ranked second with a .945 fielding percentage, and was fourth in the league with 194 outfield putouts. The 1886 Wolverines compiled an impressive 87–36 record (.707 winning percentage), but lost the National League pennant, finishing 2½ games behind the Chicago White Stockings.

==== 1887 season ====

Thompson had his breakout season in 1887 when he won the National League batting crown with .372 batting average, and he set a major league record with 166 RBIs. Thompson also led the league in hits (203), triples (23), slugging percentage (.565), total bases (308), and at bats (545). On May 7, 1887, Thompson became the first player in major league history to hit two triples with the bases loaded in the same game. The 1887 Detroit Wolverines featured four future Hall of Fame inductees (Thompson, Dan Brouthers, Deacon White, and Ned Hanlon) and won the National League pennant with a 79-45 record. The Wolverines then went on to defeat the St. Louis Browns of the American Association in a 15-game World Series challenge. Thompson played in all 15 games of the World Series and led all hitters with a .362 average, two home runs, seven RBIs and a .621 slugging percentage.

==== 1888 season ====
During the 1888 season, Thompson was sidelined with a sore arm during most of the season and appeared in only 56 games. His batting average declined by 90 points to .282, and the fortunes of the entire 1888 Detroit team followed suit. The team finished in fifth place with a 68-63 record. With high salaries owed to the team&#x27;s star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 season with the players being sold to other teams.

=== Philadelphia Phillies ===

==== 1889–1892 ====
On October 16, 1888, Thompson was purchased from the Wolverines by the Philadelphia Quakers (known as the Philadelphia Phillies beginning in 1890), for $5,000 cash (equal to $ today).

In his first season with Philadelphia, Thompson hit .296 and led the National League with a career-high 20 home runs. He also became the first major league player to reach 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases (Thompson stole 24 bases) in the same season. Thompson improved his batting average to .313 in 1890 and led the league in both hits (172) and doubles (41). Thompson&#x27;s batting average dipped slightly below .300 in 1891 (.294) but bounced back in 1892 to .305. In each of his first four seasons with the Phillies, Thompson finished among the league leaders in total bases and RBIs. He ranked third in total bases in 1889 (262), 1890 (243), and 1893 (263), second in RBIs in 1892 (104), and third in RBIs in 1890 (102). He also tallied a career-high 32 outfield assists to lead the National League in 1891. (It has been suggested that Thompson&#x27;s assist and home run totals in Philadelphia were aided by the short 300-foot right field fence at the Huntingdon Street Grounds.) The Phillies were a good, but not great team, during Thompson&#x27;s first four years in Philadelphia, finishing in fourth place in 1889, 1891 and 1892, and in third place in 1890.

==== 1893–1895 ====
From 1893 to 1895, Thompson hit his stride with the Phillies. During those three years, he hit .390 and averaged 207 hits, 125 runs, 146 RBIs, 21 triples, and 24 stolen bases. And he compiled those numbers while striking out an average of only 14 times per season. Despite Thompson&#x27;s contributions, the Phillies were unable to compete for the National League pennant, finishing in fourth place in 1893 and 1894 and in third place in 1895.

Thompson&#x27;s 1893 totals included a league-leading 222 hits and 37 doubles. After the 1893 season, Thompson vowed not to return to Philadelphia in protest over the owners&#x27; penny-pinching ways and the team&#x27;s inability to compete for a pennant. In October 1893, Thompson announced: &quot;I shall not play again in Philadelphia, and I told Harry Wright it would be a waste of time for him to write to me about signing. The cheese-paring methods of the management ... have been the causes leading to my resolution. ... The management [has] made a barrel of money, but they grind the players into the dirt.&quot; Thompson finally agreed in March 1894 to return to the Phillies, but only after management agreed to improve travel accommodations.

In 1894, Thompson was part of the only all-.400-hitting outfield of all-time. All four Philadelphia outfielders ended the season with a batting average better than .400 (Tuck Turner at .416, Thompson and Ed Delahanty at .407, and Billy Hamilton at .404). Thompson missed a month from the 1894 season with an injury to the little finger on his left hand. Doctors determined that the smaller bones in the finger were dead, and portions of the finger were surgically removed in mid-May 1894. Despite the injury and partial amputation, and being limited to only 102 games, Thompson compiled a .407 batting average with a career-high 28 triples and a league-leading 147 RBIs. His 1894 ratio of 1.44 RBIs per game remains the all-time major league record. Also, his 28 triples was the second highest total in major league history up to that time and remains the fifth highest of all time. Thompson also led the National League with a career-high .696 slugging percentage, and he hit for the cycle on August 17, 1894.

In 1895, Thompson compiled a .392 batting average with 211 hits in 119 games and led the National League in slugging percentage (.654), total bases (352), extra base hits (84), home runs (18), and RBIs (165). His average of 1.39 RBIs per game in 1895 remains second in major league history—trailing Thompson&#x27;s 1.44 ratio in 1894. Thompson also continued to perform well defensively with 31 outfield assists, second most in the league. From June 11 to 21, Thompson had 6 consecutive games with at least 3 or more hits. Since then, only Jimmy Johnston (June 24–30, 1923) and George Brett (May 8–13, 1976) had 6 straight games with at least 3 or more hits.

==== 1896–1898 ====
At age 36, Thompson played his last full season of professional baseball in 1896. His average dipped to .298, but he still managed to collect 100 RBIs. Thompson&#x27;s throwing remained strong as he turned in one of the finest defensive performances of his career. Despite appearing in only 119 games in the outfield, he led the league in outfield fielding percentage (.974), outfield assists (28), and double plays from the outfield (11). One sports writer noted that, even at age 38, Thompson &quot;possessed an arm that the fastest sprinters in the big league had a lot of respect for.&quot; As a team, however, the Phillies fell to eighth place in the National League with a 62-68 record.
In 1897, at age 37, Thompson was sidelined by pain and appeared in only three games. Some accounts suggest that Thompson&#x27;s absence from the lineup may have also been the result of his not getting along with Philadelphia&#x27;s new manager George Stallings. Without Thompson, the 1897 Phillies dropped to 10th place with a 55-77 record.

Before the 1898 season began, Thompson gave an interview in which he questioned the Phillies chances to compete in 1898: &quot;What are the Phillies&#x27; chances this season? Six clubs, Cincinnati Baltimore, Boston, New York, Cleveland and Brooklyn are bound to beat them, and they will have to fight hard to lead the second division, and I very much doubt if they can do that.&quot; Though his loyalty to the Phillies was questioned, Thompson did return in 1898 and was batting .349 with 15 RBIs, five doubles, three triples, a home run after 14 games. However, Thompson opted to leave the team in May 1898 and return to his home in Detroit. His sudden retirement has been attributed to a &quot;combination of homesickness and chronic back pain.&quot; Other accounts indicate that continued tension with manager Stallings contributed to Thompson&#x27;s decision to retire.

=== Detroit Tigers ===

Late in the 1906 baseball season, Thompson briefly returned to the major leagues as a player for the Detroit Tigers. With starting outfielders Ty Cobb and Davy Jones out of the Tigers lineup with injuries, Thompson volunteered to fill in. At age 46, Thompson had remained active, playing baseball for the Detroit Athletic Club and other local teams. Accordingly, in late August and early September 1906, he took his old place in right field for Detroit. Thompson&#x27;s return to baseball led to an increase in attendance, as &quot;the stands and bleachers were full of special Thompson delegations.&quot; After getting a hit and two RBIs in his first game, he totaled seven hits, four runs, three RBIs and a triple in eight games with the Tigers. At age 46, he became, and remains, the oldest player to hit a triple in the major leagues. Detroit sports writer Paul H. Bruske noted that Thompson was still able to throw the ball from deep right field to the plate &quot;on a line&quot; and that he still had &quot;a lot of speed on the bases.&quot;

=== Career statistics and legacy ===
In 15 major league seasons, Thompson compiled a .331 batting average with 1,988 hits, 343 doubles, 161 triples, 126 home runs, 1,305 RBIs, and 232 stolen bases. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.

Thompson was one of the most prolific run producers in baseball history. His career RBI to games played ratio of .923 (1,305 RBIs in 1,410 games) remains the highest in major league history, higher even than Lou Gehrig (.921), Hank Greenberg (.915), Joe DiMaggio (.885), and Babe Ruth (.884). In 1895, Thompson averaged 1.44 RBIs per game (147 RBIs in 102 games), still a major league record. His 166 RBIs in 1887 (in only 127 games) was 62 more than anyone else in the league that year, and it stood as the major league record until 1921 when Babe Ruth collected 168 (albeit in 152 games). Thompson still holds the major league record for most RBIs in a single month with 61 in August 1894 while playing for the Phillies.

Thompson was also one of the best power hitters of the era before Babe Ruth. At the end of the 19th century, Thompson&#x27;s 126 career home runs ranked second only to Roger Connor. Defensively, Thompson still ranks among the all-time major league leaders with 61 double plays from the outfield (16th all time) and 283 outfield assists (12th all time). Thompson has also been credited by baseball historians with perfecting &quot;the art of throwing the ball to the plate on one bounce, which catchers found easier to handle than the usual throw on the fly.&quot; Bill Watkins, who managed Thompson in Detroit, recalled: &quot;He was a fine fielder and had a cannon arm and will live in my memory as the greatest natural hitter of all time.&quot;

In a 1913 story on Thompson, Detroit sports writer Maclean Kennedy noted that Thompson&#x27;s drives &quot;were the direct cause of more hats being smashed, more backs that were thumped til they were black and blue by some wild-eyed fan sitting in the seat behind, more outbursts of frenzied shrieks and howls of glee, than those of any other player who ever wore a Detroit uniform&quot;, barring only the two great stars of the day, Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford.

== Family and later years ==
Thompson was married in 1888 to Ida Morasha of Detroit. They had no children and made their home in Detroit until Thompson&#x27;s death. After retiring from baseball, Thompson invested in real estate and was financially comfortable in his later years. He was appointed a U.S. Deputy Marshall during World War I and also worked as the crier in the courtroom of U.S. District Court Judge Arthur J. Tuttle. He was &quot;well known&quot; and a &quot;well liked&quot; figure at the federal building in Detroit.

Thompson died in 1922 at age 62. He had a heart attack while serving as an election inspector on November 7 and was stricken again later in the morning after being taken to his home located at 6468 Trumbull Avenue in Detroit. Upon learning of Thompson&#x27;s death, his former Detroit manager Bill Watkins recalled Thompson as &quot;not only a great baseball player, but as one of the finest gentlemen I ever knew.&quot; At Thompson&#x27;s funeral, &quot;Michigan&#x27;s foremost citizens – state and city officials, judges, bankers, doctors, millionaires, laborers – paid homage ... to their beloved friend&quot;, and the neighborhood in which Thompson lived &quot;was packed with expensive automobiles and their liveried chauffeurs&quot; as workmen and wealthy men &quot;discussed their favorite player with an unusual spirit of camaraderie.&quot; Thompson was interred at the historic Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.

<doc id="828240" wikidata="Q6866264" url="?curid=828240" title="Minister of National Revenue">
<text>The minister of national revenue () is the minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who is responsible for the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), as well as the administration of taxation law and collection. 

The current minister of national revenue is Élisabeth Brière who took office on December 20, 2024.

==History==
The responsibility for collecting taxes was first assigned to the minister of inland revenue, formed in 1867. Between 1892 and 1897, during the 7th Canadian Parliament, the portfolio was considered to be only of the ministry, but not the Cabinet, and was thus referred to as the controller of inland revenue during that time. The &quot;minister of inland revenue&quot; title returned after 1897 and remained until the office was formally abolished.

In 1918, the offices of the minister of inland revenue and the minister of customs were combined into a new position, the minister of customs and inland revenue. In 1921, the minister of customs and inland revenue was replaced by the minister of customs and excise by Statute 11-12 Geo. V, c. 26, which assented to on 4 June 1921. 

On March 31, 1927, when the position of minister of customs and excise was abolished and replaced by the present day minister of national revenue. The new National Revenue department was established by expanding the former Department of Customs and Excise with a new facility for the collection of income tax, which had formerly been the responsibility of the Department of Finance. The department became known as Revenue Canada during the 1970s, and subsequently became the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) in 1999. In 2003, the CCRA was split into the Canada Revenue Agency and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), the latter falling under the public safety and emergency preparedness portfolio.

<doc id="828257" wikidata="Q1062626" url="?curid=828257" title="Chapacuran languages">
<text>The Chapacuran languages are a nearly extinct Native American language family of South America. Almost all Chapacuran languages are extinct, and the four that are extant are moribund, with the exception of Wari&#x27;. They are spoken in Rondônia in the southern Amazon Basin of Brazil and in northern Bolivia. 

According to Kaufman (1990), the Chapacuran family could be related to the extinct Wamo language.

==Languages==
===Angenot (1997)===
List of Chapacuran languages from Angenot (1997):

Spoken in Brazil:
*Torá 
*Urupá
*Jarú
*Jamará
*Oro Win
*Wariʼ (Pakaas Novos)
*Tapoaya
*Kutiana
*Matáwa (Matáma)
*Kumana (Cautario)
*Uomo
*Urunamakan
*Kujuna
*Pawumwa-Wanyam
*Abitana-Wanyam
*Kabishi-Wanyam
*Miguelenho-Wanyam

Spoken in Bolivia:
*Moré (Iten)
*Muré
*Itoreauhip
*Rokorona
*Herisobokono
*Chapakura (Huachi, Tapakura)
*Kitemoka (Kitemo)
*Napeka (Nape)
*Kusikia-Manasi
===Birchall (2013)===
Birchall et al. (2013) classify the dozen known Chapacuran languages as follows:
*Chapacuran
**Kitemoka–Tapakura
***Chapacura 
***Quitemo 
**Moreic–Waric
***Moreic–Tor
****Nuclear More
*****Itene (90 speakers)
*****Cumana (3 speakers)
****Torá 
***Waric
****Urupa–Yaru:
*****Urupa 
*****Yaru 
****Wanham–Wari–Oro Win
*****Wanham 
*****Wari–Oro Win
******Oro Win (5 speakers)
******Wari&#x27; (2,700 speakers)
**(position unclear) Napeca (Nape) 
**(position unclear) Rocorona (Ocorono) 
All languages are rather closely related. 

Extinct languages for which Loukotka says &#x27;nothing&#x27; is known, but which may have been Chapacuran, include Cujuna, Mataua, Urunumaca, and Herisobocono. Similarities with Mure appear to be loans.

===Birchall, Dunn &amp; Greenhill (2016)===
Birchall, Dunn &amp; Greenhill (2016) give the following phylogenetic tree of Chapacuran, based on a computational phylogenetic analysis.

==Language contact==
Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Irantxe, Puinave-Kak, and Arawa language families due to contact.

==Varieties==
Below is a full list of Chapacuran language varieties listed by Loukotka (1968), including names of unattested varieties.

*Chapacura / Huachi / Tapacura - extinct language once spoken on the Blanco River and around Lake Chitiopa, Santa Cruz province, Bolivia.
*Irene / Moré - spoken on the Guaporé River, Azul River, and Mamoré River, Beni province, Bolivia.
*Itoreauhip - spoken between the Guaporé River and Azul River in Bolivia.
*Quitemo - once spoken on the Uruvaito River, Santa Cruz province, Bolivia.
*Nape - once spoken in the same country on Lake Chitiopa.
*Mure - once spoken on the San Martín River in Bolivia.
*Rocorona - once spoken on the San Martín River.
*Herisebocon - once spoken on the Rapulo River near the old mission of San Borja, Bolivia. (Unattested.)
*Wañám / Huanyam / Pawumwa - spoken between the São Miguel River and São Domingo River, territory of Rondônia, Brazil.

*Tapoaya - spoken by an unknown tribe at the sources of the Cautario River. (Unattested.)
*Cujuna - spoken by a very little known tribe, now perhaps extinct, to the north of the Kumaná tribe. (Unattested.)
*Urupá / Ituarupa - spoken on the Urupá River, Rondônia.
*Yarú - spoken by a few families on the Jaru River.
*Yamarú - extinct language once spoken on the Jamari River. (Unattested.)
*Torá / Tura - formerly spoken on the Marmelos River and Paricá River, state of Amazonas; now by a few individuals on the Posta Cabeça d&#x27;anta, state of Amazonas.

==Vocabulary==
Loukotka (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items for the Chapacuran languages.

==Proto-language==

Below are Proto-Chapacuran (Proto-Chapakura) reconstructions from the &quot;Diachronic Atlas of Comparative Linguistics&quot; (DiACL) online, cited from Angenot de Lima (1997). English glosses are from DiACL, and the original Portuguese glosses are from Angenot de Lima (1997). For the full list of original Portuguese glosses, see the corresponding Portuguese article.

<text>The minister of veterans affairs () is a member of the Cabinet of Canada and the minister of the Crown responsible for Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC). Since 2015, the minister has concurrently been appointed the associate minister of national defence. 

VAC is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for administering benefits for members and veterans of the Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and their family members and caregivers. 

== History ==
The position was created in the Canadian Cabinet in 1944. The Department of Veterans Affairs was created out of the Department of Pensions and National Health, and was given the responsibility of administering benefits for war veterans. Its first responsibility was assisting in the reintegration of demobilized soldiers into civilian life and assisting them with health care, education, employment, income support, and pensions.

The department is largely responsible for medical care, rehabilitation, and disability pensions and awards for veterans. Appeals from departmental decisions on disability pensions and awards are presented by veterans to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board; Veterans Affairs Canada provides veterans appearing before the Board with the assistance of lawyers from the semi-autonomous Bureau of Pensions Advocates free of charge.

==List of ministers==

Key:

Prior to 1944, the responsibilities of the current Veterans Affairs portfolio were part of the now-defunct post of Minister of Pensions and National Health.

==Military service==

Many ministers, all of whom were officers, have had prior military experience. The posting does not, however, require prior military service.

<doc id="828263" wikidata="Q2043038" url="?curid=828263" title="Ozark Jubilee">
<text>Ozark Jubilee is a 1950s American television program that featured country music&#x27;s top stars of the day. It was produced in Springfield, Missouri. The weekly live stage show premiered on ABC-TV on January 22, 1955, was renamed Country Music Jubilee on July 6, 1957, and was finally named Jubilee USA on August 2, 1958. Originating &quot;from the heart of the Ozarks&quot;, the Saturday night variety series helped popularize country music in America&#x27;s cities and suburbs, drawing more than nine million viewers. The ABC Radio version was heard by millions more starting in August 1954.

A typical program included a mix of vocal and instrumental performances, comedy routines, square dancing and an occasional novelty act. The host was Red Foley, one of the nation&#x27;s top country music personalities having been ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the #5 Top Country Artist for the 1940s and #5 in the 1950s. Big names such as Patsy Cline, Eddy Arnold, Johnny Cash and Faron Young were interspersed with a regular cast, including a group of young talent the &quot;Jubilee&quot; brought to national fame: 11-year-old Brenda Lee, Porter Wagoner, Wanda Jackson, Sonny James, Jean Shepard and The Browns. Other featured cast members were Webb Pierce, Bobby Lord, Leroy Van Dyke, Norma Jean and Carl Smith.

Carl Perkins, singing &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, made his TV debut on the series, which showcased hundreds of popular artists performing everything from rockabilly, country and western, bluegrass and honky tonk to the Nashville sound, gospel and folk. Several now-legendary session musicians provided accompaniment at times during the show&#x27;s run, including Grady Martin, Hank Garland, Bob Moore, Charlie Haden, Cecil Brower, Tommy Jackson and Bud Isaacs. The genial Foley closed each show from the Jewell Theatre in downtown Springfield with a &quot;song of inspiration&quot; or a recitation from his &quot;Keepsake Album&quot;; and his sign-off was &quot;Goodnight mama, goodnight papa&quot;, before walking into the audience to shake hands as the credits rolled.

The &quot;Jubilee&quot; was canceled after almost six years as rock and roll grew in popularity, and in part because of publicity surrounding tax evasion charges against Foley, who was later acquitted. On September 24, 1960, the final telecast, like the first in 1955, opened with Foley&#x27;s singing of &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;. The program concluded with his performance of &quot;May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You&quot;. The series was voted Best Country Music Show by &quot;Fame&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual TV critics poll in 1957 and 1960. In 1961, NBC-TV carried a spin-off, &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot;.

== Earlier country music television programs ==

The first (and first live) country music program on network television was &quot;Village Barn&quot;, broadcast from 1948–50 by NBC from a New York City nightclub. From the late 1940s through the 1950s, the U.S. networks carried a handful of other country music shows, including &quot;Hayloft Hoedown&quot; and &quot;ABC Barn Dance&quot; (ABC); &quot;Saturday Night Jamboree&quot; (NBC); and &quot;Windy City Jamboree&quot; and &quot;The Old American Barn Dance&quot; (DuMont). NBC and later ABC also aired &quot;Midwestern Hayride&quot;. The shows, however, were generally short-lived summer replacements and had few if any well-known performers.

&quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; was the first network TV program to feature America&#x27;s top country music stars, and as a result, was the first country music program to attract a significant national viewership. At five years and eight months, it also holds the record for the longest-running country music series on network television (&quot;Hee Haw&quot; was syndicated after two years on CBS, and &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; presents a much broader variety of music).

== ABC-TV schedules ==

*1954–55 season (&quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;) Starting January 22, 1955: Saturday, 9–10 p.m. Starting July 2, 1955: Saturday, 7:30–9 p.m.
*1955–56 season (&quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;): Saturday, 7:30–9 p.m.
*1956–57 season (&quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;) Starting October 4, 1956: Thursday, 10–11 p.m. Starting December 29, 1956: Saturday, 8–9 p.m.
*1957–58 season (&quot;Country Music Jubilee&quot;): Saturday, 8–9 p.m.
*1958–59 season (&quot;Jubilee USA&quot;) Starting September 29, 1958: Monday, 8–8:30 p.m. Starting November 1, 1958: Saturday, 8–9 p.m.
*1959–60 season (&quot;Jubilee USA&quot;) Starting October 3, 1959: Saturday, 10–11 p.m. – September 24, 1960

From October 15, 1955, to September 15, 1956, the program aired from 7:30–8 p.m. every fourth Saturday when ABC televised &quot;The Grand Ole Opry&quot; live from 8–9 p.m. From March through September 1956, the &quot;Junior Jubilee&quot; edition aired in the 7:30–8 p.m. time slot. In contrast to many network series which went on summer hiatus, the &quot;Jubilee&quot; was live throughout the year.

== Red Foley and the rise of Springfield ==

During the late 1940s and 1950s, Springfield broadcasters Ralph Foster and Si Siman produced nationally syndicated radio shows through Foster&#x27;s RadiOzark Enterprises, and aired them locally over his KWTO, also a stepping-stone for numerous country stars. Their stable of country music shows and talent grew, and Foster believed Springfield could dethrone Nashville to become the &quot;crossroads of country music.&quot; He realized television was the key, and named his new company Crossroads TV Productions, Inc., with Siman and John B. Mahaffey (Foster&#x27;s nephew) as managing vice presidents. A financial backer was local businessman Lester E. Cox. In December 1953, they launched &quot; Ozark Jubilee&quot; on Springfield&#x27;s KYTV-TV. 
In April 1954, after extensive negotiations, Siman lured Red Foley from Nashville to host the show with a one-year contract, renewed for three more in 1955. It was a major coup; Foley was considered by many to be America&#x27;s top country music star. In 1946 he replaced Roy Acuff as emcee of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; segment carried by NBC Radio, and his popularity during the following eight years was credited with establishing it as the number one country music show. Three months later, in July 1954, ABC-TV agreed to buy the &quot;Jubilee&quot;; and by August, was carrying a radio version hosted by Foley that had begun in July on KWTO.

To represent the regular performers on KWTO and the &quot;Jubilee&quot;, in March 1955 Foster established Top Talent, Inc., in partnership with Siman; and to publish their songs, Siman established Earl Barton Music, Inc. with partners Foster, Mahaffey and Cox Siman also handled talent bookings for the show. Foster, known by cast and crew as &quot;the Skipper&quot;, made an appearance on the final broadcast of &quot;Jubilee USA&quot;, singing &quot;Woodman, Spare that Tree&quot;.

By 1956, Springfield, with two other ABC shows, ranked behind only New York and Hollywood for originating network television programming. Top Talent was booking &quot;Jubilee&quot; artists across the country, and that April, the &quot;Jubilee&quot; had finished third among men. According to &quot;The St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; that February, &quot;Springfield has become the recognized center of the country music world. In fact, it is generally agreed in television, recording and radio circles, that Springfield, now a city of 90,000, has shaken Nashville, Tennessee, home of The Grand Ole Opry and long-time mecca of hillbilly musicians, to its very foundations.&quot; But the 1957 departures of Porter Wagoner and Brenda Lee to the Music City signaled the shift would not be permanent, and Springfield never generated the business or revenues of Nashville.

Publicity surrounding federal income tax evasion charges pending against Foley during 1960 influenced ABC&#x27;s decision to cancel the program, although his first trial that fall ended in a hung jury; and after a second trial he was quickly acquitted on April 23, 1961. The previous October, ABC had begun airing the popular &quot;Fight of the Week&quot; in the &quot;Jubilee&#x27;s&quot; former time slot (the show had replaced &quot;The Saturday Night Fights&quot; in 1955).

== Performers ==

===Cast===

The &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; cast was originally headlined by Wanda Jackson, Norma Jean, Bobby Lord, Webb Pierce, Marvin Rainwater, Porter Wagoner and Slim Wilson, who was also front man for both the Tall Timber Trio, made up of &quot;Speedy&quot; Haworth (guitar), Bob White (bass guitar) and &quot;Doc&quot; Martin (steel guitar); and the Jubilee Band, composed of Haworth, Martin, White, Johnny Gailey (drums), Paul Mitchell (piano) and Zed Tennis (fiddle). Featured vocalists included Leroy Van Dyke, Suzi Arden, Chuck Bowers, Sonny James, Tommy Sosebee and Tabby West. Singers Hawkshaw Hawkins and Jean Shepard, who met on the show, later married. 

The versatile Wilson was also half of the show&#x27;s Flash and Whistler (with Floyd &quot;Goo Goo&quot; Rutledge); and Rutledge was half of Lennie and Goo Goo (with Lennie Aleshire), both country music comedy duos. Other comedians were Pete Stamper, Shug Fisher, KWTO&#x27;s Bill Ring, Uncle Cyp and Aunt Sap Brasfield, and Luke Warmwater.

The cast also included The Foggy River Boys, a singing quartet later known as The Marksmen (George Richardson, Les Robertson, Don Taylor and Earl Terry); Harold Morrison (banjo) and Jimmy Gately (guitar), a bluegrass duo; and The Wagoner Trio, made up of Wagoner, Haworth and Don Warden (steel guitar).

The house band was first known as The Crossroads Boys, composed of Grady Martin, Billy Burke, Bud Isaacs, Tommy Jackson, Paul Mitchell, Jimmy Selph, Bob Moore and Mel Bly; but the name was soon changed to Bill Wimberly and His Country Rhythm Boys, a seven-piece group that alternated weekly during 1955 with Grady Martin and His Winging Strings, featuring Moore, Jackson, Isaacs and Hank Garland.

Pierce hosted the first half-hour of the 90-minute programs once a month beginning October 15, 1955; Wagoner and James joined him in monthly rotation from January through at least July 1956. Substitute hosts included Wilson, Eddy Arnold, and Jim Reeves (May–July 1958). The on-camera announcer was Joe Slattery, a former Pan Am and US Army Air Forces pilot who later became president of AFTRA.

The &quot;Jubilee&quot; featured two square dance groups: the Promenaders (with caller Lowell &quot;L. D.&quot; Keller), a competitive team originally from Southwest Missouri State College; and a children&#x27;s group from Camdenton, Missouri, the (Lake of the Ozarks) Tadpoles (with caller Buford Foster). Several other groups, including the Ozark Sashayers (with caller Rex Kreider) and the teenage Wagon Wheelers (with caller Gary Ellison), made guest appearances.

Foley&#x27;s son-in-law, Pat Boone, occasionally appeared; as did his eldest daughter, Betty. Willie Nelson and his eventual third wife, Shirley Simpson, both auditioned for the show, but only Simpson (given the stage surname Caddell) made it.

Frank Clement, Missouri&#x27;s U.S. senators Tom Hennings and Stuart Symington, and Missouri Lt. Gov. Jim Blair appeared, as did St. Louis Cardinals baseball star Stan Musial.

=== The &quot;Jubilee&quot; and Brenda Lee ===

On February 23, 1956, 11-year-old Brenda Lee, living in Augusta, Georgia, turned down $30 to sing on a Swainsboro radio station to see Foley and a visiting &quot;Jubilee&quot; promotional unit at Bell Auditorium. A local disc jockey convinced Foley to hear her sing before the show. He was stunned and agreed to let Lee perform &quot;Jambalaya&quot; that night. Foley later recalled his reaction:

&quot;Jubilee&quot; producer-director Bryan Bisney contacted her stepfather, Buell &quot;Jay&quot; Rainwater, who mailed him a tape recording of Lee singing &quot;Jambalaya&quot; on an Augusta radio show with a snapshot of Lee in Cincinnati, Ohio with Jimmie Skinner (who had appeared on the show in 1955). He booked her network debut for March 31, 1956 to sing &quot;Jambalaya&quot; on the second &quot;Junior Jubilee&quot; edition of the show.

The &quot;New York Journal American&quot;&#x27;s Jack O&#x27;Brien began his April 1 column with, &quot;Didn&#x27;t catch the name of the 9-year-old singer on last night&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; but she belts a song like a star.&quot; The show received three times the usual fan mail with nearly every letter asking to see her again, and Lee&#x27;s family soon moved to Springfield. Although her five-year contract with Top Talent was broken by a 1957 lawsuit brought by her mother and her manager, she made regular appearances on the program throughout its run.

=== Carl Perkins, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, and Elvis ===

Carl Perkins and the Perkins Brothers Band made their television debut on &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; on March 17, 1956, performing Perkins&#x27; No. 1 hit, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; and the B side, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot;. The group included Perkins (lead guitar and vocalist), Jay Perkins (rhythm guitar), Clayton Perkins (bass guitar) and W.S. Holland (drums). Coincidentally, Elvis Presley performed the song that same Saturday night on CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Stage Show&quot;, which overlapped the &quot;Jubilee&quot; from 8–8:30 p.m. ET (Presley first performed the song February 11 on &quot;Stage Show&quot;). An automobile accident en route to New York prevented the group from next appearing on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; on March 24. Perkins returned to the &quot;Jubilee&quot; on February 2, 1957 to again sing &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; and his then-current hit, &quot;Matchbox&quot;.

Both Perkins and Presley were fans of the &quot;Jubilee&quot;. In 1955, Presley saw Charlie Hodge, his eventual friend and stage assistant, perform on the program. He first met Hodge when a &quot;Jubilee &quot; promotional unit later visited Memphis, Tennessee. That same year, Presley asked Bobby Lord to get him an appearance on the show, but Lord told Presley the producers viewed him as &quot;a flash in the pan.&quot;

=== Patsy Cline ===

Patsy Cline made sixteen appearances on the &quot;Jubilee&quot;, which gave her the opportunity to choose her own material for a national audience. She first appeared in January 1956, returning on April 21. In 1957, she appeared on February 9; and on June 22 (the Oklahoma State Fair remote) she performed &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; and &quot;Try Again&quot;. On August 10, 1957 she sang her new single, &quot;Three Cigarettes (In an Ashtray)&quot; and &quot;Try Again&quot;. Her December 5 appearance included &quot;Make Believe&quot;, a duet with Foley; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;; and &quot;Then You&#x27;ll Know&quot;. During the program, Foley presented Cline with &quot;The Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Most Promising County &amp; Western Female Artist award, and &quot;Music Vendor&quot; magazine&#x27;s award for Greatest Achievement in Records in 1957 (for &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot;).

In 1958, Cline appeared on February 21 and April 26. On November 7, 1959, she sang &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; and &quot;Come on In&quot;, then &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Church&quot; as a duet with Slim Wilson. On December 7, she sang her &quot;Got a Lot of Rhythm in My Soul&quot; and &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, released in January 1960; and sang duets with Ferlin Husky (&quot;Let it Snow&quot;) and Foley (&quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;). On June 4, 1960, Cline soloed with &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; and &quot;How Can I Face Tomorrow&quot;, released in July; and sang &quot;I&#x27;m Hogtied Over You&quot; with Cowboy Copas and &quot;Rueben, Reuben&quot; with June Valli and Eddy Arnold.

== Junior Jubilee ==

Every fourth Saturday from March 31 through September 15 (and on December 13), 1956, a special edition of &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; showcased young country music performers. &quot;Junior Jubilee&quot; aired from 7:30–8 p.m. when ABC televised &quot;The Grand Ole Opry&quot; from 8–9 p.m. Although Foley appeared, 10-year-old singer Libby Horne of McAlester, Oklahoma was the ostensible emcee. Little Johnny Edwards 6-year-old singer of Sarcoxie, Missouri 1956. Brenda Lee made her first appearances on the program. Other performers included seven-year-old singer &quot;Cookie&quot; McKinney, guitarist John &quot;Bucky&quot; Wilkin, 12-year-old fiddler Clyde Wayne Spears, singer-guitarist Mike Breid, seven-year-old Billy Joe Morris, and child square dancers the Whirli-jiggers. &quot;Junior Jubilee&quot; first appeared as a show segment on November 19, 1955, and returned as a portion of &quot;Jubilee USA&quot; on November 8, 1958.

==Public service==

Foley periodically asked viewers to contribute to various charities, including the March of Dimes, Easter Seals, Community Chest, and aid following the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake. Guests in 1956 included the Polio Mother of the Year and the March of Dimes poster family. Groups recognized on the program included the Girl Scouts and the Chiefs of Police.

The &quot;Jubilee&quot; also staged performances for inmates at the US Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, including special Christmas shows.

== Audience and sponsors ==

During the program&#x27;s 1955 premiere, Foley asked, &quot;If you folks want us to come and visit at your house like this every Saturday night, why don&#x27;t you drop me a line in Springfield, Missouri?&quot; In the next week 25,258 cards and letters arrived from 45 of the 48 states, and the show typically received 6,000 letters each week. In May 1955, carried by 72 ABC affiliates, it was the only TV show with an audience equally divided among men, women and children, according to the American Research Bureau (ARB). For 1955, ABC reported these achievements for the program, citing ARB data:

* Largest male U.S. television audience
* 28 percent more per-set viewers than the average of all prime time shows
* Largest per-set U.S. television audience, 3.40 persons

By early 1956, the &quot;Jubilee&quot; had earned a 19.2 Nielsen rating, and ARB estimated its weekly TV audience to be as high as 9,078,000. (&quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; had the most viewers, 16,577,500.) By 1959 the show was carried by 150 affiliates, but rarely won its time slot, competing with such heavyweights as &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; on NBC; and on CBS, &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, and in 1960, the top-rated &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Its ratings were also hampered when a few major-market affiliates such as WABC-TV took advantage of network break-away cues to carry 30- or, when it was 90 minutes, 60-minute portions.

ABC promoted and sold the program as prime family entertainment. Sponsors included the American Chicle Co., Rolaids, Anacin (1956), Williamson-Dickie (1957–60), Massey Ferguson (1958–60), Arrid, Postum (1958), Carter&#x27;s Little Pills and Sargent&#x27;s Dog Care Products (1960); and was sold nationally by Ted Bates &amp; Company. Joe Slattery handled station breaks and some commercials, often appearing during &quot;Jubilee USA&quot; with Massey Ferguson farm tractors and accessories in film clips or on stage.

The live audience was briefly part of the broadcasts when a camera would swing around to show the sold-out Jewell Theatre. Attendees, often nearly 90 percent out-of-state, would cheer and hold up signs or banners with the names of their hometowns. Producers estimated 350,000 people (from as many as 30 states on some nights) attended the performances at the Jewell from 1954–1960. Visitors also came from Canada, Mexico, Hawaii and Bermuda. Tickets had to be requested as long as six weeks in advance and it was believed to be the only network TV show with paid admission ($1.00 main floor, 75 cents balcony and 50 cents standing room). Second (non-broadcast) shows were frequently added to accommodate the demand during the summers.

The &quot;Jubilee&quot; regularly noted it was carried &quot;coast to coast&quot;, and to promote the show, &quot;personal appearance units&quot;, often including Foley, performed at state fairs and other venues in 42 states, Alaska (then a U.S. territory) and every Canadian province.

== Production ==

&quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;&#x27;s first broadcast was December 26, 1953 with an hour-long telecast from the studio of KYTV before a live audience, hosted by Bill Bailey. The two-and-a-half-hour radio version, hosted by Foley, began July 17, 1954 on KWTO from Springfield&#x27;s 1,100-seat Jewell Theatre, a former movie theater. ABC Radio began carrying 30 minutes of the program August 7, and added another half-hour on a delayed basis on Tuesday nights starting October 5. The KYTV show followed with 90-minute TV simulcasts from the theater starting September 4, 1954. 

The program debuted on ABC-TV on January 22, 1955, but the first 14 national telecasts were staged at KOMU-TV in Columbia, Missouri because network television transmission capability from Springfield was not available. Columbia had a microwave transmitter, however, for ABC coverage of University of Missouri football games. After AT&amp;T installed a microwave link in Springfield to transmit to Kansas City (which could feed to the network via Chicago), and modifications were made to the Jewell (including extending the stage and adding a control room), the program returned to the theater with the first broadcast April 30. The show was sent to KYTV by a local microwave link from the station&#x27;s remote van. Rehearsals for Saturday shows were held on Fridays, with run-throughs Saturday afternoons.

The program used equipment and staff from KYTV, which was then a dual ABC-NBC network affiliate. It debuted using two black-and-white RCA TK-11 cameras with a third added a year later. Vocals of some hit songs were lip-synched. Overhead shots of square dancing and for other creative purposes were accomplished using a large mirror angled above the stage. One 1960 show included an elephant from a visiting Adams &amp; Sells Circus quietly performing on stage behind an &quot;oblivious&quot; Uncle Cyp. The program had two remote broadcasts: June 22, 1957 from the Oklahoma State Fair during the state&#x27;s semi-centennial; and February 21, 1959 from the Masonic Auditorium in Detroit, Michigan for a Massey Ferguson dealers convention.

In July 1957, Dan Lounsbery, producer of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, and its art director, Paul Barnes, were hired by ABC to spend several weeks with the show to improve the sets and pacing. July 6 saw the first program under the name &quot;Country Music Jubilee&quot;, which, according to ABC Vice President James Aubry Jr., &quot;recognizes the wide popularity of country music.&quot;

The &quot;Jubilee&quot;&#x27;s executive producers were Crossroads vice presidents Si Siman and John Mahaffey, and the producer-director was Bryan &quot;Walt&quot; Bisney. The co-writers were publicist Don Richardson and Bob &quot;Bevo&quot; Tubert. Fred I. Rains was floor director and Bill Ring frequently served as associate producer. The original scenic designer was Don Sebring; his successor, Andy Miller, later did scenic design for nearby Silver Dollar City and Richardson became its public relations director.

== &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot; ==

In 1961, NBC-TV carried a summer spin-off called &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot; from March 17–September 22. Starting in May, it was the first network color television series to originate outside New York City or Hollywood. The weekly program featured five rotating hosts: Snooky Lanson, Tex Ritter, Jimmy Wakely, Carl Smith and Rex Allen. Produced from Springfield&#x27;s Landers Theatre, it was similar to &quot;Jubilee USA&quot; and featured some of the same cast members, including Bobby Lord, the Promenaders and Slim Wilson&#x27;s Jubilee Band. Barbara Mandrell made her network debut on the program.

== Legacy ==

After cancellation by ABC, live performances from the Jewell Theatre continued over KWTO-AM (with 15 minutes carried by NBC Radio on Saturday afternoons through 1961), and groups of cast members continued making personal appearances. The theater was demolished five months later in February 1961; a marker in Jubilee Park, dedicated in 1988, notes its location at 216 South Jefferson Ave. Cast and production crew members held reunions at the 1988 dedication, in October 1992, and in April 1999. 

The &quot;Jubilee&quot; was culturally significant for giving millions of urban and suburban American viewers their first regular exposure to country music. As Webb Pierce told &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 1956, &quot;Once upon a time, it was almost impossible to sell country music in a place like New York City. Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else.&quot; In return, the &quot;Jubilee&quot; gave many of the biggest names in country music their first experiences performing on television.

The program also gave national exposure to a number of female country music pioneers, including Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Wanda Jackson, Jan Howard, Jean Shepard, Kitty Wells and Norma Jean; the show also featured a local African-American group, the Philharmonics. It represented the peak of Red Foley&#x27;s career, who had been America&#x27;s top country star since World War II and who remains one of the biggest-selling country artists of all time. Finally, the &quot;Jubilee&quot; in many ways laid the groundwork for neighboring Branson, Missouri to become America&#x27;s top country music tourist destination.

The program was the subject of a 1993 book, &quot;Remembering the Ozark Jubilee&quot;; and in 2003, Ozarks Public Television released an hour-long documentary, &quot;Ozark Jubilee: A Living Legacy&quot;. Cast and crew gathered once again for its premiere at the Landers Theatre.

Streets in a residential neighborhood of nearby Nixa, Missouri include Ozark Jubilee Drive, Red Foley Court, Slim Wilson Boulevard, Bill Ring Court, Zed Tennis Street and Haworth Court.

== Missouri State University digitization project ==

More than sixty full or partial kinescopes of the program were preserved at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Missouri State University&#x27;s Meyer Library has partnered with the UCLA archives to digitize all viable episodes and post them on a dedicated channel. Digitizing each episode costs $2,500, and sponsorship opportunities are available. As of February 2023, more than 70 episodes or segments have been posted. Meyer Library also houses the Bryan T. E. Bisney Ozark Jubilee Collection of Bisney&#x27;s logbooks, notes and photos.

<text>Witnica () is a town in western Poland, situated in the Lubusz Voivodeship, with 6,747 inhabitants (2019).

The town is located in the historic Lubusz Land. The town&#x27;s name derives from the Polish words &quot;wić&quot; or &quot;witka&quot;, meaning a willow twig or a type of willow.

Along with Lubusz Land it was part of medieval Poland, and later it was also under the rule of Brandenburg, the Czech Crown, Prussia, and between 1871 and 1945 it was part of Germany, located in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. The Germans brought Polish prisoners of war for forced labour to the town during World War II. In the final stages of World War II, half of the population fled before the Red Army captured the town in February 1945. Polish POWs were liberated.

After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II the area became again part of Poland. The remaining population was expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. New Polish citizens, mostly themselves expellées from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, came to the town. War damage was not significant, reaching 8% of the buildings. The ruins were dismantled to obtain bricks for the reconstruction of Warsaw destroyed by the Germans.

==Economy==
The town is known for its brewery (&quot;Browar Witnica&quot;), established in 1848.

<text>George Edward &quot;Duffy&quot; Lewis (April 18, 1888 – June 17, 1979) was an American professional baseball left fielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees, and the Washington Senators from 1910 to 1921.

Lewis attended Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California. He made his MLB debut with the Red Sox in 1910, where he formed the Golden Outfield with Tris Speaker and Harry Hooper. He won three World Series championships with Boston (1912, 1915, and 1916). The Red Sox traded Lewis to the Yankees, where he played in 1919 and 1920, before they traded him to the Senators before the 1921 season. He continued to play and manage in the minor leagues until 1929.

Lewis continued to work in baseball as a coach for the Boston Braves from 1931 to 1935, and then as their traveling secretary through 1961. Lewis is a member of the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame and the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
George Edward Lewis was born to Mary () and George Lewis on April 18, 1888, in San Francisco, California. He acquired his nickname from his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He had an older brother and an older sister. When Lewis was seven years old, he served as the mascot for the local baseball team in Alameda, California.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Lewis attended Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California before making his professional baseball debut with the Alameda Grays of the California State League in 1907. He played for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1908 and 1909. He also played winter baseball in Yuma, Arizona, where he was first noticed by Boston Red Sox owner John I. Taylor. In September 1909, the Red Sox selected Lewis from Oakland in the Rule 5 draft. He finished the 1909 season with Oakland, and reported to spring training with the Red Sox in 1910.

===Boston Red Sox===
Lewis became the Red Sox starting left fielder in 1910. Harry Hooper, who had played left field for the Red Sox, became the right fielder. Along with Hooper and center fielder Tris Speaker, Lewis played in the Golden Outfield from 1910 to 1915. In his rookie season, Lewis batted .283 with eight home runs, second-most in the American League, and 29 doubles, third-most in the league. In 1911, he batted .307 with seven home runs, In 1912, he batted .284 with six home runs. His 109 runs batted in (RBIs) were the second-most in the league. The Red Sox won the American League championship, and defeated the New York Giants in the 1912 World Series in eight games. Lewis batted .188 (6-for-32) in the series.
In 1913, Lewis batted .298 with no home runs. Babe Ruth made his major league debut on July 11, 1914, and Lewis pinch hit for Ruth during the game. He was the only player to pinch hit for Ruth during the latter&#x27;s major league career. Lewis finished the 1914 season with a .278 batting average. In 1915, Lewis batted .291 with 31 doubles, which was the second-most in the league. The Red Sox faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1915 World Series, and won in five games. Lewis batted .444 (8-for-18) against the Phillies. He also recorded five out of the 12 RBIs in the series for Boston. He drove in the game-winning runs in both Games 3 and 4, and made several catches that helped Boston win the series. After the World Series, Lewis returned to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he performed vaudeville shows at the Pantanges Theatre in Oakland for $500 a week ($ in current dollar terms).

The Red Sox traded Speaker to the Cleveland Indians in 1916, and Boston manager Bill Carrigan experimented with playing Lewis in center field before returning him to left field. The Red Sox repeated as American League champions in 1916, with Lewis batting .268. In the 1916 World Series, the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins in five games; Lewis batted .353 (6-for-17). Lewis batted .302 for the Red Sox in 1917; it was the ninth-highest batting average in the league that season.

===Later playing career===
Lewis did not play for the Red Sox during the 1918 season due to his service in the United States Navy during World War I. He enlisted as a yeoman and was stationed at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, where he was the player-manager for the shipyard&#x27;s baseball team. He became a chief petty officer before the end of his service.

On December 18, 1918, the Red Sox traded Lewis, along with Dutch Leonard and Ernie Shore, to the New York Yankees for Ray Caldwell, Frank Gilhooley, Slim Love, Roxy Walters and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms). He batted .272 with seven home runs for the Yankees in 1919, while leading the American League with 141 games played. He began to lose playing time in 1920 following the major league debut of Bob Meusel and the acquisition of Ruth from Boston, but Lewis still batted .271 in 107 games played. On December 31, 1920, the Yankees traded Lewis and George Mogridge to the Washington Senators for Braggo Roth. Lewis batted .186 in 27 games for Washington before he was released in June.
After he was released from the Washington Senators, Lewis signed with the Salt Lake City Bees of the PCL for the remainder of the 1921 season. He led the PCL with a .403 batting average in 1921. He served as player-manager for Salt Lake City from 1922 through 1924. While he was with Salt Lake City, the Red Sox hired him to serve as a scout based in the Western United States. Lewis was the player-manager for the Portland Beavers of the PCL for the 1925 season, and for the Mobile Bears of the Southern Association for the 1926 season. Disappointed with the team&#x27;s performance, Lewis resigned from Mobile in June 1926. He finished the 1926 season as a left fielder for the Jersey City Skeeters of the International League. In 1927, he was player-manager for the Portland Eskimos of the New England League, and they won the league championship that season. He retired as a player after the 1927 season, but remained as Portland&#x27;s manager in the 1928 season. He began the 1929 season managing Portland, but resigned in June, citing poor health.

===Career retrospective===
Lewis led all American League left fielders in assists in 1910 (30), 1911 (27), 1912 (23), and 1913 (26). He finished his major league career with 209 assists, the third-most among major league left fielders behind Jimmy Sheckard (243) and Zach Wheat (231). Lewis also led all American League left fielders in double plays turned in 1910 (eight), and in putouts in 1910 (264) and 1912 (300). His .985 fielding percentage was the ninth-best for all American League outfielders in 1919.

At bat, Lewis was a line-drive hitter who was often the cleanup hitter in the batting order. He was considered to be a clutch hitter. In 11 seasons, Lewis batted .284 with 38 home runs, 793 RBIs, 1,518 hits, 289 doubles, and 68 triples.

===Duffy&#x27;s Cliff===

In 1912, the Red Sox moved into Fenway Park, which featured a high mound that formed an incline in front of the left field wall, now better known as the Green Monster. Lewis practiced catching the ball on the way up the incline and throwing the ball while descending. He mastered fielding on the incline to such an extent that it became known as &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Cliff&quot;. Sports cartoons of the period often depicted him as a mountain climber making catches amid sheep and snowcaps. The mound was removed during renovations of Fenway Park conducted in 1934.

==Later career==
Lewis had invested his money in the stock market, and lost it in the stock market crash of 1929, compelling him to return to baseball. He became a coach for the Boston Braves in 1931. He coached the Braves through 1935. Ruth played with the Braves in 1935, and Lewis witnessed Ruth&#x27;s final major league home run, much as he had witnessed Ruth&#x27;s first home run with the Red Sox. He became the Braves&#x27; traveling secretary in 1936, and always insisted on first class travel. Lewis stayed with the organization through their relocation to Milwaukee. He retired from the Braves in 1961.

==Later life==

Lewis married Eleanor Ruth Keane of Boston, a fan that he met at the Huntington Avenue Grounds, after the 1911 season. They did not have children. Together, they built a house in Boyes Hot Springs, California, but the house and their possessions were destroyed in a fire in 1923.

After his baseball career, Lewis and his wife retired to Salem, New Hampshire, where he had VIP box seats at Rockingham Park. Eleanor died in 1976.

Lewis died in Salem on June 17, 1979. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Londonderry, New Hampshire. As he had no money or living relatives, he was buried in an unmarked grave. When some volunteer caretakers found out about this, they began to raise money for one, with the Red Sox contributing. A headstone was dedicated in June 2001.

Lewis was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2002 and into the PCL Hall of Fame in 2012.

<doc id="828279" wikidata="Q2735449" url="?curid=828279" title="NewDES">
<text>In cryptography, NewDES is a symmetric key block cipher. It was created in 1984–1985 by Robert Scott as a potential DES replacement.

Despite its name, it is not derived from DES and has quite a different structure. Its intended niche as a DES replacement has now mostly been filled by AES. The algorithm was revised with a modified key schedule in 1996 to counter a related-key attack; this version is sometimes referred to as NewDES-96.

In 2004, Scott posted some comments on sci.crypt reflecting on the motivation behind NewDES&#x27;s design and what he might have done differently so as to make the cipher more secure.

==Algorithm==
NewDES, unlike DES, has no bit-level permutations, making it easy to implement in software. All operations are performed on whole bytes. It is a product cipher, consisting of 17 rounds performed on a 64-bit data block and makes use of a 120-bit key.

In each round, subkey material is XORed with the 1-byte sub-blocks of data, then fed through an S-box, the output of which is then XORed with another sub-block of data. In total, 8 XORs are performed in each round. The S-box is derived from the United States Declaration of Independence (used as a nothing-up-my-sleeve number).

Each set of two rounds uses seven 1-byte subkeys, which are derived by splitting 56 bits of the key into bytes. The key is then rotated 56 bits for use in the next two rounds.

==Cryptanalysis==
Only a small amount of cryptanalysis has been published on NewDES. The designer showed that NewDES exhibits the full avalanche effect after seven rounds: every ciphertext bit depends on every plaintext bit and key bit.

NewDES has the same complementation property that DES has: namely, that if

:formula_1

then

:formula_2

where

:formula_3

is the bitwise complement of &quot;x&quot;. This means that the work factor for a brute force attack is reduced by a factor of 2. Eli Biham also noticed that changing a full byte in all the key and data bytes leads to another complementation property. This reduces the work factor by 28.

Biham&#x27;s related-key attack can break NewDES with 233 chosen-key chosen plaintexts, meaning that NewDES is not as secure as DES.

John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, and David Wagner used related-key cryptanalysis to develop another attack on NewDES; it requires 232 known plaintexts and one related key.

<doc id="828290" wikidata="Q340687" url="?curid=828290" title="Underarm hair">
<text>Underarm hair, also known as axillary hair or armpit hair, is the hair in the underarm area (&quot;axilla&quot;).

== Development==

Underarm or axillary hair goes through four stages of development, as staged by the Wolfsdorf Axillary Hair Scale, driven by weak androgens produced by the adrenal in males and females during adrenarche, and testosterone from the testicle in males during puberty.

The Wolfsdorf Axillary Hair Staging system provides a standardized method for assessing pubertal progression and androgenic activity in pediatric populations. Similar to Tanner Staging for pubic hair, it classifies axillary hair growth into four stages:

* Wolfsdorf Stage 1 – No axillary hair
* Wolfsdorf Stage 2 – Sparse, soft hair
* Wolfsdorf Stage 3 – Coarser hair with increased volume
* Wolfsdorf Stage 4 – Full adult-like axillary hair

The importance of human underarm hair is unclear. It may naturally wick sweat or other moisture away from the skin, aiding ventilation. Colonization by odor-producing bacteria is thereby transferred away from the skin (see skin flora).

==Function==

=== Reducing friction ===
Armpit hair prevents skin-to-skin contact during activities that involve arm motion, such as running and walking. The same applies to pubic hair.

===Spreading pheromones===
The armpits release odor-containing pheromones, a naturally produced chemical that plays an important role in sexual attraction. Armpit hair traps odor, making the pheromones even stronger. A study in 2018 including 96 heterosexual couples found that there were stress-relieving benefits to smelling a romantic partner&#x27;s natural scent.

==Impact of hair removal==
===Effect on odor===
А 2012 study on the impact of hair removal on odor found that shaved armpits were rated the same as unshaved armpits.

=== Chemical absorption ===
A 2017 study on chemical absorption from deodorants as a result of hair removal showed an increase in chemical absorption from .01% to .06% where skin has been damaged by recent shaving.

A 2003 study on aluminum antiperspirant usage and the age of breast cancer onset tentatively concluded that &quot;underarm shaving with antiperspirant/deodorant use may play a role in breast cancer.&quot; However, this was later proven to be false.

<text>Ultravox or Ultravox Media On Demand Server (UltraMODS) is a streaming video project by AOL. The goal of the project is to create a service for routers akin to SHOUTcast, aiming to help the data be handled better, to allow for more efficient handling of more users, and to enable much faster channel changing.

== Marketing ==
Certain streams made available by Shoutcast use Ultravox. AOL Radio has since moved to a non-streaming &quot;beamcast&quot; approach to music listening as of late Summer 2008. CBS Radio stations featured on AOL Radio use a variety of streaming methods not limited to Ultravox.

== Technology ==
This format uses &quot;uvox&quot; URLs, and can be viewed in Winamp. Nullsoft is reportedly helping AOL create Ultravox. Nullsoft also released Nullsoft Streaming Video, which is streamed through Ultravox software.

Michael Wise is on the ISMA Board of Directors, and is reported as being actively involved in AOL’s streaming technology planning. In an effort to drive interoperability and lower distribution costs, he and his team are now working to standardize key parts of Ultravox, AOL’s own streaming technology platform.

Ultravox is implemented in servers and in the firmware of certain routers to provide efficient, scalable delivery to hundreds of thousands of customers simultaneously.

<doc id="828307" wikidata="Q132062" url="?curid=828307" title="The Lathe of Heaven">
<text>The Lathe of Heaven is a 1971 science fiction novel by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, first serialized in the American science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. It received nominations for the 1972 Hugo and the 1971 Nebula Award, and won the Locus Award for Best Novel in 1972. Two television film adaptations were released: the PBS production, &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot; (1980), and &quot;Lathe of Heaven&quot; (2002), a remake produced by the A&amp;E Network.

The novel explores themes and philosophies such as positivism, Taoism, behaviorism, and utilitarianism. Its central plot surrounds a man whose dreams are able to alter past and present reality and the ramifications of those psychologically derived changes for better and worse.

==Title==
The title is from the writings of Chuang Tzu (Zhuang Zhou) — specifically a passage from Book XXIII, paragraph 7, quoted as an epigraph to Chapter 3 of the novel:

To let understanding stop at what cannot be understood is a high attainment. Those who cannot do it will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven. (知止乎其所不能知，至矣。若有不即是者，天鈞敗之。)

Other epigraphs from Chuang Tzu appear throughout the novel. Le Guin chose the title because she loved the quotation. However, it seems that quote is a mis-translation of Chuang Tzu&#x27;s Chinese text. 

In &quot;Nothingness, Being, and Dao: Ontology and Cosmology in the Zhuangzi&quot;, Chai describes the concept of 天鈞 as &#x27;heavenly equilibrium&#x27;.

In an interview with Bill Moyers for the 2000 DVD release of the 1980 adaptation, Le Guin clarified the issue:

...it&#x27;s a terrible mis-translation apparently, I didn&#x27;t know that at the time. There were no lathes in China at the time that was said. Joseph Needham wrote me and said &quot;It&#x27;s a lovely translation, but it&#x27;s wrong&quot;.

She published her rendition of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, &quot;The Book of the Way and Its Virtue&quot; by Lao Tzu, the traditional founder of Taoism (Daoism). In the notes at the end of this book, she explains this choice:

The language of some [versions of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;] was so obscure as to make me feel the book must be beyond Western comprehension. (James Legge&#x27;s version was one of these, although I found the title for a book of mine, &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;, in Legge. Years later, Joseph Needham, the great scholar of Chinese science and technology, wrote to tell me in the kindest, most unreproachful fashion Legge was a bit off on that one; when &quot;Chuang Tzu&quot; was written the lathe hadn&#x27;t been invented.) 

Translated editions titled the novel differently. The German and first Portuguese edition titles, and , mean literally &quot;the scourge [or whip] of heaven&quot;. The French, Swedish and second Portuguese edition titles, , and , translate as &quot;the other side of the dream&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The book is set in Portland, Oregon, in the year 2002. Portland has three million inhabitants and continuous rain. It is deprived enough for the poorer inhabitants to have kwashiorkor, a protein deprivation from malnutrition. Although impoverished, the culture is similar to the 1970s in the United States. There is also a massive war in the Middle East. Climate change reduces quality of life.

George Orr, a draftsman and addict, abuses drugs to prevent &quot;effective&quot; dreams that change reality. After one of these dreams, the new reality is the only reality for everyone else, but Orr retains memory of the previous reality. Under threat of incarceration, Orr undergoes treatment for his addiction, attending therapy sessions with ambitious psychiatrist and sleep researcher William Haber. Haber, gradually believing Orr&#x27;s claims that his &quot;effective&quot; dreams can affect the waking world, seeks to use Orr&#x27;s power to change the planet. His experiments with a biofeedback/EEG machine, nicknamed the Augmentor, enhance Orr&#x27;s abilities while producing a series of increasingly intolerable alternative worlds based on an assortment of utopian (and dystopian) premises:
* Eliminating over-population is disastrous after Orr dreams that a devastating plague eliminated most humans.
* Attempting to remove the scourge of cancer from society creates a world where citizens are routinely allowed to euthanize one another for being considered a threat to the gene pool.
* &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; results in an alien invasion of the Moon, uniting mankind against the external threat while creating new conflict in &quot;cislunar space&quot;.

Each effective dream gives Haber more wealth and status until he is effectively ruler of the planet. Orr&#x27;s finances also improve, but he is unhappy with Haber&#x27;s meddling and just wants to let things be. Increasingly frightened by Haber&#x27;s lust for power and delusions of divinity, Orr contacts lawyer Heather Lelache to represent him against Haber. He falls in love with Heather but is unsuccessful in getting released from therapy. Despite this failure, Lelache is able to be present at one of the sessions, which allows her to remember two realities: one where her husband died early in the Middle East War and another where he died just before the truce because of the aliens. She seeks out Orr after he attempts to escape Haber by fleeing to the countryside, where he reveals to her that the world was destroyed by a nuclear war in April 1998. Orr dreamed it back into existence as he lay dying in the ruins, and doubts the reality of what now exists, considering it nothing more than a mere dream.
Afraid of the potential harm Haber could do to reality and frustrated by his refusal to admit to Orr that he knows the power of his effective dreams, Orr believes that his only option may be to commit suicide. Lelache suggests that she assist him in dreaming an effective dream to make Haber more benevolent instead, to which he eventually agrees. She tries to help Orr but also tries to improve the planet; when she suggests to a dreaming Orr that the aliens should no longer be on the Moon, they invade the Earth instead. In the resultant fighting, Mount Hood is bombed and the &#x27;dormant&#x27; volcano produces a spectacular eruption.

During that disaster, Orr returns to Haber, who has Orr dream of peaceful aliens. For a time, everybody experiences stability, but Haber continues meddling. His suggestion that Orr dream away racism results in everyone becoming gray, and changes much of history: &quot;...he had searched his memory and had found in it no address that had been delivered on a battlefield in Gettysburg, nor any man known to history named Martin Luther King&quot; (LeGuin, 130). Lelache&#x27;s parents are different races, so she never existed in that alternative reality. Orr dreams a gray version of her with a milder personality; the two marry. Mount Hood continues to erupt, and he is concerned the planet is losing coherence.

After speaking with one of the aliens, who seem to have a cryptic understanding of the effective dreams, Orr suddenly understands his situation and confronts Haber. In their final session, Haber &quot;cures&quot; Orr of his ability to dream effectively by suggesting Orr dream that his dreams no longer affect reality. Haber has become frustrated with Orr&#x27;s resistance and used his research from studying Orr&#x27;s brain during his sessions to give himself the same power. Haber&#x27;s first effective dream represents a significant break with the various realities created by Orr, and threatens to destroy reality. Despite Orr&#x27;s efforts to prevent it, the gray Lelache is annihilated by the encroaching chaos. Orr successfully shuts off the Augmentor as coherent existence threatens to dissolve into undifferentiated chaos. The world is saved, but exists now as a mix of random elements from several realities.

In the new reality, Orr works at a kitchen store operated by one of the aliens. Haber survives, his mind shattered by his knowledge of unreality, and only exists because Orr&#x27;s dreams restored him. Lelache is also restored, though she is left with only a slight memory of Orr. Orr is resigned to the loss of the Lelache he loved, but resolves to romance the one that exists now. The story ends as the two have coffee, while his inscrutable alien employer observes.
==Reception==
Theodore Sturgeon, reviewing &quot;Lathe&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found it to be &quot;a very good book,&quot; praising Le Guin for &quot;produc[ing] a rare and powerful synthesis of poetry and science, reason and emotion.&quot; Lester del Rey, however, faulted the novel for an arbitrary and ineffective second half, saying &quot;with wonder piled on wonder, the plot simply loses credibility.&quot;

==Viewpoints==
Although technology plays a minor role, the novel is concerned with philosophical questions about our desire to control our destiny, with Haber&#x27;s positivist approach pitted against a Taoist equanimity. The beginnings of the chapters also feature quotes from H. G. Wells, Victor Hugo and Taoist sages. Due to its portrayal of psychologically derived alternative realities, the story is described as Le Guin&#x27;s tribute to Philip K. Dick. In his biography of Dick, Lawrence Sutin described Le Guin as having &quot;long been a staunch public advocate of Phil&#x27;s talent&quot;. According to Sutin, &quot;&quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot; was, by her acknowledgment, influenced by his [Dick&#x27;s] sixties works.&quot;
The book is critical of behaviorism. Orr, a deceptively mild yet very strong and honest man, is labeled sick because he is immensely frightened by his ability to change reality. He is forced to undergo treatment. His efforts to get rid of Haber are viewed as suspect because he is a psychiatric patient. Haber, meanwhile, is very charming, extroverted, and confident, yet he eventually goes insane and almost destroys reality. He dismisses Orr&#x27;s qualms about meddling with reality with paternalistic psychobabble, and is more concerned with his machine and Orr&#x27;s powers than with curing his patient.

The book is also critical of the philosophy of utilitarianism, satirising the phrase &quot;The Greatest Happiness for the Greatest Number.&quot; It is critical of eugenics, which it suggests would be a key feature of a culture based on utilitarian ethics.

It has been suggested that Le Guin named her protagonist &quot;George Orr&quot; as an homage to British author George Orwell, as well as to draw comparisons between the dystopic worlds she describes in &quot;Lathe&quot; and the dystopia Orwell envisioned in his novel &quot;1984&quot;. It might also have the additional meaning &quot;either / or&quot;.

==Adaptations==
An adaptation titled &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;, produced by the public television station WNET, and directed by David Loxton and Fred Barzyk, was released in 1980. It was the first direct-to-TV film production by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and was produced with a budget of $250,000. Generally faithful to the novel, it stars Bruce Davison as George Orr, Kevin Conway as William Haber, and Margaret Avery as Heather Lelache. Le Guin was heavily involved in the production of the 1980 adaptation, and expressed her satisfaction with it several times.

PBS&#x27; rights to rebroadcast the film expired in 1988, and it became the most-requested program in PBS history. Fans were extremely critical of WNET&#x27;s supposed &quot;warehousing&quot; of the film, but the budgetary barriers to rebroadcast were high: The station needed to pay for and clear rights with all participants in the original program; negotiate a special agreement with the composer of the film&#x27;s score; and deal with The Beatles recording excerpted in the original soundtrack, &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, which is an integral plot point in both the novel and the film. A cover version replaces the Beatles&#x27; own recording in the home video release.

The home video release is remastered from a video tape of the original broadcast. PBS, anticipating that the rights issues would beset the production forever, did not save a copy of the film production in their archives.

A second adaptation was released in 2002 and retitled &quot;Lathe of Heaven&quot;. Produced for the A&amp;E Network and directed by Philip Haas, the film starred James Caan, Lukas Haas, and Lisa Bonet. The 2002 adaptation discards a significant portion of the plot and some of the characters. Le Guin had no involvement in making the film.

A stage adaptation by Edward Einhorn, produced by Untitled Theater Company #61, ran from June 6 to June 30, 2012, at the 3LD Art + Technology Center in New York City.

<doc id="828311" wikidata="Q2261054" url="?curid=828311" title="Buddhist eschatology">
<text>Buddhist eschatology, like many facets of modern Buddhist practice and belief, came into existence during its development in China, and, through the blending of Buddhist cosmological understanding and Daoist eschatological views, created a complex canon of apocalyptic beliefs. These beliefs, although not entirely part of orthodox Buddhism, form an important collection of Chinese Buddhist traditions which bridge the gap between the monastic order and local beliefs of Imperial China.

Although the main source of writings describing eschatological beliefs in Chinese Buddhism are so called “apocryphal” texts, these are an invaluable source of information in the study of Buddhism as it was actually practiced, as the available monastic sources depicting Buddhism are merely the tip of an iceberg, of which the body is still mostly submerged and hidden from view (Zürcher (Perspectives) 169). These eschatological Buddhist groups began to appear in China from on (Overmyer 46), and escalated in number and intricacy from the Sui until the Song dynasty. Therein is where many lay and cleric groups (of laymen and clergy) such as the White Lotus Society and Amida Buddhist clergy appeared and took to propagating eschatological scriptures.

There are two major points of Buddhist eschatology: the appearance of Maitreya and the Sermon of the Seven Suns.

== Maitreya ==
Buddha described his teachings disappearing five thousand years from his passing, corresponding approximately to the year . At this time, knowledge of dharma will be lost as well. The last of his relics will be gathered in Bodh Gaya and cremated. There will be a new era in which the next Buddha Maitreya will appear, but it will be preceded by the degeneration of human society. This will be a period of greed, lust, poverty, ill will, violence, murder, impiety, physical weakness, sexual depravity and societal collapse, and even the Buddha himself will be forgotten. This will be followed by a new golden age (see below).

The earliest mention of Maitreya is in the Cakavatti (Sihanada) Sutta in Digha Nikaya 26 of the Pali Canon. 

Maitreya Buddha is then foretold to be born in the city of Ketumatī in present-day Benares, whose king will be the Cakkavattī Sankha. Sankha will live in the former palace of King Mahāpanadā, but later will give the palace away to become a follower of Maitreya.

In Mahayana Buddhism, Maitreya will attain &quot;bodhi&quot; in seven days, the minimum period, by virtue of his many lives of preparation. Once Buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati Pure Land, an earthly paradise associated with the Indian city of Varanasi or Benares in Uttar Pradesh. In Mahayana Buddhism, Buddhas preside over a Pure Land (the Buddha Amitabha presides over the Sukhavati Pure Land, more popularly known as the Western Paradise).

At this time he will teach humanity of the ten non-virtuous deeds (killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views) and the ten virtuous deeds (the abandonment of: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views). He is described by Conze in Buddhist Scriptures:

He currently resides in Tushita, but will come to Jambudvipa as successor to the historic Śākyamuni Buddha. Maitreya will achieve complete enlightenment during his lifetime, and following this reawakening, he will bring back the timeless teaching of dharma to this plane.

== Sermon of the Seven Suns ==

In the Sattasūriya sutta (sermon of the &quot;Seven Suns&quot;) in the Aṅguttara Nikāya [AN 7.66] of the Pali Canon, the Buddha describes the ultimate fate of the world in an apocalypse that will be characterized by the consequent appearance of seven suns in the sky, each causing progressive ruin until the Earth is destroyed:
The canon goes on to describe the progressive destruction of each sun. A third sun will dry the mighty Ganges and other great rivers. A fourth will cause the great lakes to evaporate, and a fifth will dry the oceans. Finally the final suns will appear:

The sermon completes with the planet engulfed by a vast inferno.

== Developments ==
Buddhists believe that the historical Buddha Shakyamuni is only the latest in a series of Buddhas that stretches back into the past. The belief in the decline and disappearance of Buddhism in the world has exerted significant influence in the development of Buddhism since the time of the Buddha. In Vajrayana Buddhism and various other forms of esoteric Buddhism, the use of tantra is justified by the degenerate state of the present world. The East Asian belief in the decline of the Dharma (called mappo in Japanese) was instrumental in the emergence of Pure Land Buddhism. Within the Theravada tradition, debate over whether Nirvana was still attainable in the present age helped prompt the creation of the Dhammayutt Order in Thailand.

In China, Buddhist eschatology was strengthened by the Daoist influence: the messianic features of Maitreya are widely emphasized. The figure of Prince Moonlight 月光童子 obtains prominence unknown in the Sanskrit sources. Thus, one of the Tang dynasty apocrypha predicts his rebirth in the female form, thus creating religious legitimacy for the Wu Zetian Empress&#x27;s usurpation. Furthering the Daoist associations, the &quot;Sutra of Samantabhadra&quot; portrays Prince Moonlight dwelling on the Penglai Island in a cave.

Buddhism believes in cycles in which life span of human beings changes according to human nature. In Cakkavati sutta the Buddha explained the relationship between life span of human being and behaviour. As per this sutta, In the past unskillful behavior was unknown among the human race. As a result, people lived for an immensely long time—80,000 years—endowed with great beauty, wealth, pleasure, and strength. Over the course of time, though, they began behaving in various unskillful ways. This caused the human life span gradually to shorten, to the point where it now stands at 100 years, with human beauty, wealth, pleasure, and strength decreasing proportionately. In the future, as morality continues to degenerate, human life will continue to shorten to the point where the normal life span is 10 years, with people reaching sexual maturity at five.

Ultimately, conditions will deteriorate to the point of a &quot;sword-interval&quot;, in which swords appear in the hands of all human beings, and they hunt one another like game. A few people, however, will take shelter in the wilderness to escape the carnage, and when the slaughter is over, they will come out of hiding and resolve to take up a life of skillful and virtuous action again. With the recovery of virtue, the human life span will gradually increase again until it reaches 80,000 years, with people attaining sexual maturity at 500. According to the Pali Canon, it is at the zenith of this new golden age that Maitreya will appear (DN 26:25).

According to Tibetan Buddhist literature, the first Buddha lived 1,000,000 years and was 100 cubits tall, while the 28th Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama (), lived 80 years and his height was 20 cubits. This is on par with the Hindu eschatology, which says this age is the 28th &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;.

In other traditions, such as Zen, a somewhat utilitarian view is taken. The notion often exists that within each moment in time, both birth and death are manifest. As the individual &quot;dies&quot; from moment to moment, they are equally &quot;reborn&quot; in each successive moment, in what one perceives as an ongoing cycle. Thus the practitioner&#x27;s focus is shifted from considerations regarding an imagined future endpoint, to mindfulness in the present moment. In this case, the worldview is taken as a functional tool for awakening the practitioner to reality as it exists, right now.

== Causes of the end of true dharma ==
Due to the notion of the three stages of Dharma as taught by the Sakyamuni Buddha, eschatological thought is inherent to Buddhism in that non-permanence affects the &quot;sangha&quot; and Dharma teachings, just as it affects all other facets of the visible world. What differentiates eschatological groups from orthodox clergy, however, is the belief that the period of the decline of the Dharma has already begun, and that the end of Dharma is close at hand. These teachings, often propagated by self-appointed messianic figures, run counter to the state approved Buddhist teachings, as they often criticize or deplore the “current” state of affairs both within the government and the people. There are of course many sources for this eschatological belief, and throughout the history of Buddhism in China, there have been various calculations determining the beginning of the decline of Dharma. While the True Dharma period (wherein the Buddha’s teachings are taught accurately and salvation is possible) was originally said to last 1000 years, one of the first sources of anxiety within the clergy was the acceptance of women in the monastic order, which was said to have reduced the time of True Dharma to 500 years. This is accounted for in the tale of &quot;Mahapajapati&quot;, in which a woman devoutly follows the Buddha after having been refused entry into his order, until Ananda convinces the Buddha to allow her to join the other disciples. He then tells Ananda:

When asked to explain why the acceptance of women into the clergy would have such an impact, it is said that he explained as such:

Thus it seems that women in the clergy, for one reason or another, were seen as a factor which sped up the process of the decline of Dharma. Otherwise, and more importantly, the cessation of Dharma was seen as being caused by the “moral laxity of the disciples, and [could] be recovered if the disciples reform[ed]” (Chappell 125). This is where a divide appears in eschatological groups: while some believe that the True Dharma can be recovered through more assiduous practice and a return to correct transmission, understanding and application of True Dharma (Chappell 127), other groups believed that it was due to incorrect political practice from the state, and that a Saviour was required in order to overthrow the established order and set up a new era of peace and True Dharma. These ideologies were of course frowned upon by the court and such apocryphal texts, deemed dangerous, heretical, and subversive (Zürcher (Perspectives) 170), and were a source of inspiration for the burning of apocryphal scripture. Of these saviours, one Bodhisattva in particular was eventually linked with China and so is an ideal candidate for the study of these anti-establishment groups: the Bodhisattva which came to be called Yueguang, or Prince Moonlight.

== During the Song Dynasty ==

Due to the historically tenuous relationship between Buddhism and the Confucian State, and to lead the people in accordance with proper Dharma, many eschatological groups appeared during the Sui and Tang dynasty (typically attached to monasteries) and preached that the declining Dharma cycle had begun due to moral laxity or failures of the state. Among these, many groups which preached a greater devotion to the Dharma teachings as a method of salvation were deemed harmless, and so some of their apocryphal scriptures survived the burning of heretical texts. By the Southern Song dynasty, however, the Buddhist Monastic order was under heavier and heavier restraints, such as the “control of ordination, prohibition of preaching and itinerant evangelism by monks, and restraining the economic power of the monasteries” (Overmyer 43). This caused the appearance of many non-monastic groups, which were often led by laymen who had hair and might disregard other monastic rules (Overmyer 43–44) and which preached an eschatological message, typically through one of five standard apocalyptic scenarios: The return of Maitreya, the Amida Pure Land, the Manicheaen Chen Chün, or the Confucian Enlightened Emperor (Overmyer 45). Of these groups, a particularly influential one is the White Lotus Sect. Its influence is clear in that the State later referred to any Eschatological or unorthodox Buddhist sect as “White Lotus”.

Formed by Mao Tzu-Yüan in 1133, the White Lotus sect placed an emphasis on the strict dietary restrictions of its disciples, such that they were not allowed to drink wine and had to eat a vegetarian diet (Overmyer 47). Despite these dietary restrictions which mirrored those which the monastic order should also be following, the White Lotus were led by married clergy men who “wrote their own scriptures and ritual texts in the vernacular” (Overmyer 47), and the group also allowed female disciples. Mao’s relationship with the state also changed throughout his life, as White Lotus was attacked by Buddhist monks soon after its founding due to its “rejection of celibacy” and by the government for its “popularity among the people” (Overmyer 47). Exiled in 1131 because of the growing popularity of his movement, Mao was quickly pardoned and in 1133 began to preach at the emperor’s court. He was, however, exiled again in 1157 because of his sect’s popularity and similarity to Manicheaens, another vegetarian sect (Overmyer 48). His sect nonetheless continued to spread until the 20th century.

== In Nichiren Buddhism ==

Nichiren, a messianic Buddhist leader of Kamakura-era Japan, was born in 1222. During Nichiren&#x27;s time, Japan had many natural disasters such as floods, storms, earthquakes, famines, landslides, tidal waves, and comets. It was believed that the period of Declining Dharma was already unfolding (Kodera 42–43). Nichiren criticized the preachings of Amitabha and Pure Land Buddhist schools, and argued instead that the calamities were tied to human behaviour, and that only human righteousness could prevent natural disasters (Kodera 43). He described the situation as such:

Nichiren instead preached that only a return to the teachings of the Lotus Sutra would save the country from destruction (Kodera 44). His preaching of the Lotus Sutra, as well as his disparagement of Honen Buddhist groups, were met with much resistance, and he was imprisoned or exiled several times during his life. During one such occasion, he was nearly executed, but was saved by miraculous circumstances in which the sky was “suddenly ablaze with lightning” and the executioner became dizzy and fell (Kodera 47). Because of the miraculous nature of his survival, Nichiren would come to believe that his body had died, only to begin his second spiritual life (Kodera 47). This only served to strengthen his self-image as a messianic saviour of Japan, and he would preach the Lotus Sutra until his death in 1282.

Nichiren’s belief system was his explication of the Mongol invasions of Japan in 1274 and 1281. Because of his belief that the apocalypse was coming due to the moral deprivation of the population of Japan, Nichiren saw the coming Mongols as a natural force sent to eradicate the incorrect beliefs and practices of the Honen monks and local religious practitioners in order to instate the True Dharma in their aftermath (Kodera 50). He believed, even after both invasions failed, that only a “complete and sudden conversion” would save the country from the destruction created by the monks of other sects and faiths (Kodera 51).

== Prince Moonlight ==

Prince Moonlight, or &quot;Yueguang Tongzi&quot;, was originally a relatively small Bodhisattva in pre-Chinese Mahayana Buddhism, but due to the combination of Daoist eschatological beliefs, the concept of &quot;Mofa&quot; (the last period of Dharma), and the notion of a supernatural saviour, &quot;Yueguang Tongzi&quot; developed into an important figure in Buddhist apocalyptic lore.

The original story of Yueguang is as such: Yueguang is born to a deplorable householder named Srigupta, who at the demand of “heretical masters” invites the Buddha to a meal while setting a trap aimed at taking his life. Yueguang, now 16, pleads with his father to forgo this wrongdoing, but Srigupta turns a blind eye to his son’s pleas. When the Buddha arrives, being all-seeing, he turns the trap, a fire-pit, into a lotus pond. Srigupta, from his shame, is converted immediately and enlightened (Zürcher (Prince Moonlight) 208). In a Sui dynasty text named the Shenri Jing, however, Yueguang takes on a higher importance.

After enlightening Srigupta, the Buddha delivers a prophecy concerning Yueguang, stating that he will later be born as a saintly ruler and that he will revive the True Dharma during a time when it is about to fade away (Zürcher (Prince Moonlight) 208). Thus we see that Yueguang takes up the role not of a Buddha rediscovering the True Dharma, but rather of a saviour of the people sent to avoid the apocalyptic cataclysm of the end of Dharma and kelpa. Instead of reigniting Dharma teaching in a new cycle of time, Yueguang will now simply postpone the end of the current cycle until it once again fades away. In this sense he is a “great revivalist” and not a messiah figure. Indeed, in the Sutra of the Annihilation of the Doctrine, he states that “at the time of the disappearance of [his] Doctrine, it will be like an oil-lamp, that shines even more brightly when it is about to expire – and then it is extinguished” (the Sutra of the Annihilation of the Doctrine, qtd. In Zürcher (Prince Moonlight) 211–12).

Another reference to Yueguang is found in a text translated by Narendrayasa, in which Yueguang is said to reincarnate during the final Dharma period as &quot;Da Xing&quot;, a ruler on the continent of Jambudvipa. Here, it is said that he will make Buddhism flourish again by “the reproduction and spread of holy texts, the making of Buddha images of every kind, and the establishment of countless Buddhist sanctuaries in all parts of the empire” (Zürcher (Prince Moonlight) 210). This interpretation, however, seems to be directly referencing the Sui emperor Wendi, who in the year built hundreds of relic-shrines throughout his kingdom (Zürcher (Prince Moonlight) 210).

<doc id="828313" wikidata="Q2714915" url="?curid=828313" title="Husk (comics)">
<text>Husk (Paige Guthrie) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Guthrie is a superhero associated with the X-Men.

A mutant, Husk has the ability to remove one layer of skin—or &quot;husk&quot;—revealing an epidermis of a different composition beneath. She often changes into metal or stone form, but can shift into a variety of substances.

Husk is from a Kentucky coal mining family and is the younger sister of the X-Men&#x27;s Cannonball. Unlike her brother, Husk is self-conscious of being seen as a &quot;hick&quot; (Jubilee often called her &quot;hayseed&quot;). As a member of the X-Men&#x27;s 1990s-era junior team Generation X, she established herself as an overachiever. She later joined the X-Men.

==Publication history==
Husk first made appearances as a background character as one of Cannonball&#x27;s many siblings in &quot;Rom&quot; Annual #3 (1984) by Bill Mantlo and William Johnson and &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #42 (1986) by Chris Claremont and Jackson Guice. She was revealed as a mutant and her personality was developed by Fabian Nicieza and Tony Daniel in &quot;X-Force&quot; #32 (1994) as part of that title&#x27;s &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; crossover with &quot;New Warriors&quot;, which segued into her participation in the &quot;Generation Next&quot; arc of the &quot;Phalanx Covenant&quot;, running through &quot;X-Men&quot; #36-37 (1994) and &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #317 (1994).

Husk would then become a permanent member of Generation X (1994–2001), originally created by Scott Lobdell and Chris Bachalo. This run defined and expanded her personality and mutant abilities. After Generation X disbanded, Husk served as a member of the X-Men in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #414-443 (2002–2004), thereafter appearing sporadically as a reserve member and background character in various X-titles, highlighted by a mission during the &quot;Necrosha&quot; event in &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; #231-233 (2010).

During the X-Men&#x27;s &quot;Schism&quot;, Husk joined Cannonball and threw in with Wolverine&#x27;s side in &quot;X-Men: Regenesis&quot; #1, becoming a faculty member at the Jean Grey School in Westchester. Husk appears regularly as a supporting character in &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; (2012) from issue #2 onward.

==Fictional character biography==
The sister of the X-Man Cannonball, Paige Guthrie was born to a large Kentucky coal miner&#x27;s family. Her father died when she was very young, due to a lung affliction from working in the mines. As a teenager, she discovers her inborn mutant ability to shed her skin, metamorphosing into a different composition beneath. She has used this power to turn her body into stone, glass, and an acid-like substance, among other materials. She can also use her power to heal herself by shedding a damaged form in favor of an intact one. She normally cannot change the shape of her form, only its composition, although an issue of &quot;X-Force&quot;, written before her powers had been fully defined, depicted her transforming into a bird.

===Generation X===
From the series&#x27; beginning in 1994 until its cancellation at issue #75 in 2001, Husk was a member of the junior X-Men team Generation X, where she earned a reputation as a workaholic, constantly trying to prove herself fit for the main team. She also develops a troubled relationship with her antisocial teammate Chamber. Towards the end of the team&#x27;s existence, Paige became the group&#x27;s computer expert and develops an interest in environmental issues.

After the breakup of Generation X, Husk joins Banshee&#x27;s militant X-Corps, along with other Gen X members, to keep an eye on him. This does not end well, with Banshee&#x27;s more criminal charges staging a coup and the Gen X members having to take down the Blob.

===X-Men===
She later joined the X-Men in Chuck Austen&#x27;s 2001 revamp of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and was placed in a controversial relationship with the long-time X-Man Archangel, as Husk was 19 years old and several years Archangel&#x27;s junior.

The two took an extended leave of absence. Archangel launched a charity called &quot;Mutantes Sans Frontières&quot; in Zanzibar, a reference to Médecins Sans Frontières (&quot;Doctors Without Borders&quot;), where the two proceeded to help stop a coup with the aid of Professor X&#x27;s newest charges from nearby Genosha.

Her younger brother Jay later joined the new New Mutants team under the codename Icarus. Her sister Melody also joined the school as Aero after discovering she could fly. Melody has since been depowered after M-Day, although Paige herself retains her powers. Icarus was later killed following the events of M-Day, in a confrontation with the anti-mutant activist William Stryker and his army. The resulting battles also take the lives of dozens of other students.

She is most often seen in the current New X-Men title while tending to the wounded. In her last major appearance, she attended the funeral of her little brother.

===Divided We Stand===
The first issue of Divided We Stand revealed that Paige had returned to living with her family. She is the one who picks up her brother, Cannonball, at the airport to bring him home. However, Sam, still feeling angry over the betrayal of his X-Men team, tells her to take him to a local bar, where he picks a fight with the members of rival families from their home. Paige confronts Sam on his action after the brawl ends. Sam yells that he&#x27;s lost faith in how the life of an X-Men works and flies off angry, leaving Paige fearful for his life and mind.

===Secret Invasion===
Husk is seen fighting alongside the rest of the X-Men in San Francisco and flirting with Angel at the same time, though it would appear they are no longer a couple.

===Nation X/Necrosha===
Paige is a resident of the mutant nation of Utopia and is seen fighting alongside the New X-Men battling her reanimated former teammates Synch and Skin. Paige is subsequently sent to Muir Island with a team of X-Men led by Nightcrawler to further investigate the attacks on Utopia. When the team reaches Muir Island, they discover something came back when Destiny was resurrected - the villain Proteus. Proteus takes swift action, dispatching the teams heavy-hitters Colossus and Magneto and possessing Trance, Nightcrawler, Psylocke and Husk. While in mental possession of Husk, he displays the ability to assume a flaming energy form, something Paige was previously unable to do. Whether this is an undiscovered latent power of Paige&#x27;s or an aspect of Proteus&#x27;s reality manipulation remains unknown.

===Second Coming===
Paige was seen fighting a Nimrod with Roberto DaCosta, Avalanche and Boom-Boom and then again after the Nimrods were depowered (due to Cypher). She asked Colossus what happened and he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, Paige&quot;.

===Schism===
Following the conflict between Wolverine and Cyclops that led to the former abandoning Utopia, Husk became a teacher at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. At a faculty meeting, Paige tries to express her insecurity about not being cut out for teaching because the students aren&#x27;t listening to her. Ironically, Beast cuts her off before she can finish. Later, Cannonball expresses his frustration about there only being a memorial for dead X-Men, including their brother Jay, in the faculty lounge and that he doesn&#x27;t understand how Paige agrees with this decision when she can&#x27;t even look at Jay&#x27;s picture. Casting off Sam&#x27;s feelings, Paige announces she has class and needs to change. In reply to this, Sam states that she sheds her skin every time she&#x27;s unhappy and her power isn&#x27;t an antidepressant. At that moment, the school is attacked, and Paige is instructed to go teach as normal. During her class, Rogue interrupts and informs Paige that there is a problem with the &quot;heating system&quot;. Upon leaving the class, Paige instantly husks into her fire form and destroys the invading N&#x27;Garai in the mansion. During Paige&#x27;s time at the school, it becomes apparent that her mysterious molting condition is only worsening because her skin is in a state of constant cracking and flaking.

===Leaving the X-Men===
Over time, Paige&#x27;s condition worsens as she starts leaving around Husk replicas with her old skin (replicas that Toad, in love with her, keeps to himself and even uses in his tea parties). During the events of &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, she starts a sentimental relationship with him. Her mental condition grows worse too, and she doesn&#x27;t even acknowledge a riot in one of her classes. After that, Kitty Pryde states that Paige is in no condition to teach and suggests removing her from the active staff. In a burst of fury, Paige decides to quit the school, considering Kitty was about to fire her. Then, Paige decides to take some time for herself, leaving the school and telling Toad she will eventually come back. She even assures him she is in no need of psychiatric help.

As part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; event, a now-disfigured Husk is revealed to be one of the agents of the Hellfire Club&#x27;s new Hellfire Academy.

When Toad helps Quentin Quire to escape the Hellfire Academy, Husk and the other students try to stop them. Husk attacks Toad and strangles him, when he starts ripping off layer after layer of her skin until a normal looking Paige appears under all the husks. She has only vague memories of what happened, and does not remember her relationship with Toad. The X-Men shut down the Hellfire Academy.

It transpires that Husk&#x27;s personality shifts and subsequent mental breakdown and betrayal were caused by a secondary mutation, which means her powers now also affect her mind as well as her body. Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the academy&#x27;s new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving, Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein&#x27;s orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein after wanting to go someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she&#x27;d wake up and see him for what he really was. Husk breaks down in tears.

==Powers and abilities==
Husk possesses the mutant ability to change her physical form by shedding her skin to reveal a new layer or shape underneath. These forms take on new physical abilities or qualities appropriate to the form, such as increased weight, strength, or invulnerability. Paige has shown some ability to take on forms with energy powers - including a fiery form that generates heat and flame, and a form with acidic skin.

Husk is unable to transform into anything that exceeds her base mass. However, she is able to transform into smaller forms by transferring excess mass into another dimension.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Husk 15th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Husk 9th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Mutants From The &#x27;80s&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===

In the Age of Apocalypse, Paige was a member of Generation Next. Husk was found by Sinister along with her older sister Elizabeth and her older brother Samuel while the rest of their family, save for their youngest brother Joshua, were culled by Apocalypse&#x27;s Infinites. However, unlike Sam and Elizabeth, Paige declined Sinister&#x27;s offer to join his Elite Mutant Force. Instead she joined Magneto&#x27;s cause. Like her main Marvel Universe counterpart, Paige had a long-term relationship with Chamber, though in this case the relationship became physical as well.

Paige demonstrates greater control over her abilities compared to her primary-universe counterpart. She is able to transform all parts of her body, and was capable of adopting liquid, gaseous, and energy states. Paige can also adapt &quot;bio patterns&quot; to affect specific individuals, including a complex acid that could affect the organic steel skin of Colossus and an energy form Shadowcat could not phase through. She also had the ability to change only part of her body (such as changing a hand into a bladed weapon).

After being overrun deep in hostile territory, Paige and her Generation Next fleet team members were believed to be dead. Paige survived the battle and was enslaved by the inmates of the Seattle Core until Apocalypse&#x27;s regime fully collapsed. Husk was eventually found by her siblings and was taken to Sinister, who took his time to corrupt her and made her want revenge for the X-Men. Husk infiltrated the ranks of the X-Men as a mutant named Xorn and kidnapped Charles Lensherr; she even battled alongside the other Guthries, but was ultimately killed by Wolverine&#x27;s daughter, Kirika.

===Age of X===
In the Age of X reality Paige is seen breaking free of mutant hunters killing many of them and later meeting up with her brother, Sam. They both find their entire family dead because of the mutant hunters. She swears vengeance on the humans who did this.

===Age of X-Man===
In the Age of X-Man reality, Paige Guthrie is the Agriculture Instructor of the 10th Year class within the Summers Institute Of Higher Learning, located in Winchester, NY.

===Mutant X===
Paige is a member of the Marauders and constantly fighting with her brother, Cannonball. She is stuck in a rather grotesque form and was last seen trying to escape the group&#x27;s mysterious benefactor.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel reality, Paige Guthrie is a fourteen-year-old mutant living in the Southwest, which is overrun by Sentinels. She meets Kitty Pryde and her X-Men, and leads them to Nick Fury. She later assists Kitty Pryde in her efforts to shut down nearby makeshift mutant internment camps.

<text>In 1932, G. D. Birkhoff created a set of four postulates of Euclidean geometry in the plane, sometimes referred to as Birkhoff&#x27;s axioms. These postulates are all based on basic geometry that can be confirmed experimentally with a scale and protractor. Since the postulates build upon the real numbers, the approach is similar to a model-based introduction to Euclidean geometry.

Birkhoff&#x27;s axiomatic system was utilized in the secondary-school textbook by Birkhoff and Beatley.
These axioms were also modified by the School Mathematics Study Group to provide a new standard for teaching high school geometry, known as SMSG axioms.
A few other textbooks in the foundations of geometry use variants of Birkhoff&#x27;s axioms.

== Birkhoff&#x27;s Four Postulates==
The distance between two points and  is denoted by , and the angle formed by three points is denoted by .

Postulate I: Postulate of line measure. 
The set of points on any line can be put into a 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers so that for all points and .

Postulate II: Point-line postulate. 
There is one and only one line that contains any two given distinct points and .

Postulate III: Postulate of angle measure.

Furthermore, if the point on varies continuously in a line not containing the vertex , the number varies continuously also.

Postulate IV: Postulate of similarity.

<doc id="828321" wikidata="Q7572305" url="?curid=828321" title="Space Coast Regional Airport">
<text>Space Coast Regional Airport is in Titusville, Florida, United States, on Columbia Boulevard (State Road 405) and Washington Avenue (U.S. 1) in Brevard County. Formerly known, and still colloquially referred to, as Ti-Co (Titusville-Cocoa) Airport, it is the nearest commercial airport to the Kennedy Space Center.

== History ==

In 1943 the U.S. Government built the airport on land jointly owned by both cities, Titusville and Cocoa. The airfield had two x runways with a taxiway system. The U.S. Government developed the airport to serve as an outlying field (OLF) to Naval Air Station Sanford during World War II. The airport was built by the Civil Aeronautics Administration under the &quot;Development of Landing Areas for National Defense&quot; Program to help relieve other area military bases of training exercises during World War II. The government retained control of the airport for the duration of the war.

After the war the U.S. Navy transferred the airport and associated improvements to the War Assets Administration, which deeded the airport back to the Cities of Titusville and Cocoa by a Surrender of Lease and Quit Claim Deed dated April 18, 1947.

The taxiways and runways of the Titusville-Cocoa Airport hosted a NASCAR Grand National (now Cup Series) event, on December 30, 1956, for the 1957 NASCAR season. Fireball Roberts won in a Peter DePaolo Ford.

An airport authority was established by the Cities of Titusville and Cocoa to own, operate, improve, and maintain the airport. The property was transferred to the authority by Quit Claim Deeds from the City of Titusville on March 14, 1961, and from the City of Cocoa on April 11, 1961.

Having previously used military facilities on nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began development of its own civilian staffed launch facilities, in what became the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), on Merritt Island in the early 1960s. The location of this regional airport made it important to the transportation of NASA personnel and equipment.

Eastern Air Lines Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jetliners served Titusville with scheduled passenger flights from 1970 to 1974.

==Creation of Airport District==

The &quot;Titusville-Cocoa Airport District Act of 1963&quot; created the Titusville-Cocoa Airport District and the Titusville-Cocoa Airport Authority (&quot;Authority&quot;) to govern the operations of the airport facilities. The Authority was created to service the local, commercial, and corporate aviation needs as well as to stimulate economic growth in the local communities. The Authority replaced the original airport authority established in 1959. This legislation commissioned the Authority to govern the affairs of the Airport District. This currently includes Space Coast Regional Airport, Arthur Dunn Airpark, and Merritt Island Airport.

The 1963 Act established policies for the funding of Authority activities, including an ad valorem tax not to exceed one mil on all taxable properties within the geographical bounds of the District. Also included was the authorization of the District to issue general obligation bonds and revenue bonds to finance the acquisition, construction, or development of airport property or facilities.

==Current Airport Authority==
The Titusville-Cocoa Airport Authority now has seven members. Two are appointed from Brevard County election Districts I, II, and IV, and one is appointed at-large by the Board of County Commissioners of Brevard County. The Authority exercises hiring and oversight responsibility for the Authority&#x27;s Executive Director, a full-time civil servant airport executive who has day-to-day responsibility for the operation, maintenance and supervision of Space Coast Regional Airport, Merritt Island Airport, Arthur Dunn Airpark and associated airport staff personnel.

== Facilities ==
Space Coast Regional Airport covers and has two runways:

* Runway 18/36 , surface: asphalt
* Runway 9/27 , surface: asphalt

==Warbird Museum==

The Valiant Air Command is a frequently flyable collection of planes used in World Wars I and II. It is based here, along with a permanent collection of additional aircraft from the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War and the first Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm at the Valiant Air Command Warbird Museum. The museum provides an exhibit of air history, offering a static display of vintage Warbird aircraft, including a Douglas C-47A. Veteran tour guides recount war stories.

==Events==

The Tico Air Show (March) is an annual event since 1977 and features modern military and vintage airplane fly-bys and demonstrations, strafing runs, dog fights, vintage warbird static displays, and military exhibits. In 2008, about 30,000 visitors attended.

==Industry==
Bristow Helicopters&#x27; Bristow Academy, a helicopter flying school, employs 160 and training 350 people a year in Schweizer 300CBIs, Robinson R22s, Robinson R44s, and Bell 206Bs. They have 59 helicopters. It is the world&#x27;s largest civilian helicopter school.

The Zero Gravity Corporation offers weightless flights in its modified Boeing 727 and Airbus A300 cargo planes.

AeroDyne Detail, LLC provides mobile detailing services on the field.

<text>Merritt Island Airport is a general aviation public airport under the administration of the Titusville-Cocoa Airport Authority. It located in Merritt Island, Brevard County, Florida, United States, northwest of Patrick Space Force Base.

==History==
In the early 1940s, the Brevard County Mosquito Control District constructed the Central Brevard Airport. The airfield included two sod landing strips: a north–south strip measuring approximately in length, and a northwest–southeast strip measuring approximately in length.

An operations building and maintenance hangar were located on the south side of the airfield and the Mosquito Control District had a maintenance hangar on the north side of the airfield. The north–south landing strip was eventually abandoned, replaced by various facilities such as T-hangars that currently occupy this area.

In 1966, the Brevard County Mosquito Control District deeded the Central Brevard Airport property over to the Titusville-Cocoa Airport Authority in exchange for ten acres of land located within Space Coast Regional Airport. Central Brevard Airport was renamed Merritt Island Airport and became a public general aviation facility some time after initial construction took place in 1970 and facilities were completed in 1974.

==Facilities==

Merritt Island Airport covers and has one runway:
* Runway 11/29: , surface: asphalt

===Government activities===
* Brevard County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Aviation Unit

===Businesses===
* Space Coast Aviation - Merritt Island&#x27;s FBO
* 2FLY Airborne - international pilot training
* Buzz Airlines - aircraft charters; has a base at the airport
* Voyager Aviation International - flight training
* Sebastian Communication Inc. - avionics sales, installation and repairs

==Accidents and incidents==
On January 24, 2021, a man identified as 24 year old Abhishek Patter, a pilot from India who was training for his commercial airline pilot&#x27;s license, crashed a plane, a Piper PA-28, on nearby waters as he was flying from Palm Beach County Park Airport to Merritt Island Airport. The 24-year-old was a student at 2Fly Airborne flight school in Merritt Island according to officials in Brevard County. His body was found later by rescuers. He was the sole occupant of the aircraft when it crashed.

<text>Letraset was a company known mainly for manufacturing sheets of typefaces and other artwork elements using the dry-transfer lettering method. Letraset was acquired by the Colart group and became part of its subsidiary Winsor &amp; Newton.

== Corporate history ==

Letraset was founded in London, England, in 1959, with the launch of the Letraset Type Lettering System. In 1961, Letraset came out with their dry transfer lettering system, which pioneered the technique. 

Starting in 1964, Letraset also applied the dry rub-down transfer technique to create a children&#x27;s game called Action Transfers, which would later develop into Kalkitos (marketed by Gillette), and many other series of transferable figures that were very popular up to the 1980s. Letraset was acquired by the Swedish stationery company Esselte until 2000, when it was sold to a management buyout headed up by Martin Gibbs and Michael Travers. Eventually sold to ColArt in 2012. 

Seeing a decline in the sales of its materials in the early 1990s, Letraset moved into the desktop publishing industry, releasing software packages such as ImageStudio and ColorStudio for the Macintosh. These never saw widespread success. However, as Letraset held the rights to their fonts that had been popular on the dry transfer sheets, it made sense to enter the digital font market (see, for example, Charlotte Sans). Letraset thus began releasing many fonts in formats such as PostScript.

Fonts from designers including Martin Wait, Tim Donaldson, and David Quay were released, and many can be found on online retailers such as FontShop. Some fonts retain &quot;Letraset&quot; in their title, whereas others have been renamed by their new vendors, among them ITC.

A selection of fonts is still sold from its website, separated into fonts from Fontek and Red Rooster. Software includes Manga Studio EX and Envelopes, a plug-in for Adobe Illustrator.

Letraset is the maker of the refillable Tria markers, formerly Pantone Tria markers, which have a three-nib design and 200 colours. Additionally, Letraset offers three lines of dual-tipped markers, the alcohol-based ProMarker and FlexMarker lines, each with 148 mostly different colours and the water-based AquaMarkers with 60 colours.

Letraset was based in Le Mans, France, having previously been based in Ashford, Kent, until being acquired in June 2012 by the Colart group and becoming part of its subsidiary Winsor &amp; Newton.

== Cultural history ==

The dry rub-down transfer technique was used by the punk movement because of its ease of manipulation, its low price and the quality of the rendered layout. Letraset&#x27;s ease of use and widespread availability aligned with the do-it-yourself value of this movement by allowing punks to create designs independent from printers and publishers.

== Product ==

In common usage, the name Letraset originally referred to sheets of transfer lettering that were originally manufactured as a wet process in 1959, with each character selected and cut from a sheet, placed face-down on a small silk screen frame and wetted with a paint brush to soften and release the gum arabic adhesive which held it. The frame was then turned over and the letter located over the artwork, and the character pressed into contact with the page, with the mounting base slid away as with model aircraft transfers.

Later, in 1961, the process was simplified, and a dry transferable lettering system was developed. The range of available typefaces expanded, incorporating both classic and contemporary type designs of the period. Letraset sheets were used extensively by professional and amateur graphic designers, architects and artists in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. As a result of its relative affordability, and because of its ease of use, it also came to be used by printers, design studios and advertising agencies. In the late 1980s, Letraset started to be replaced by desktop publishing. Today, Letraset sheets are traded on eBay and elsewhere, and sometimes used so that a designer can avoid a digital look.

The name Letraset is also often used to refer generically to sheets of dry-transfer lettering of any brand. This technique was very widespread for lettering and other elements before the advent of the phototypesetting and laser computer techniques of word processing and desktop publishing. Currently, Letraset&#x27;s line of print patterns and textures are more commonly used than its lettering.

Lorem ipsum filler text has been featured on Letraset advertisements for decades. There are some indications that its use predates Letraset, but nothing definite has surfaced prior to Letraset&#x27;s popularising it.

<doc id="828345" wikidata="Q1339491" url="?curid=828345" title="Peter Watkins">
<text>Peter Watkins (born 29 October 1935) is an English filmmaker, documentarian, writer, and film theorist. He is known as a pioneer of the docudrama and the mockumentary genres, typically with heavy political content. His films present pacifist and radical ideas in a nontraditional style. He mainly concentrates his works and ideas around the mass media and our relation/participation to a movie or television documentary.

Nearly all of Watkins&#x27; films have used a combination of dramatic and documentary elements to dissect historical occurrences or possible near future events. The first of these, &quot;Culloden&quot;, portrayed the Jacobite uprising of 1745 in a documentary style, as if television reporters were interviewing the participants and accompanying them into battle; a similar device was used in his biographical film &quot;Edvard Munch&quot;. &quot;La Commune&quot; reenacts the Paris Commune days using a large cast of French non-actors. &quot;The War Game&quot; (1966) depicts the aftermath of a hypothetical nuclear attack on London. His other notable works include &quot;Edvard Munch,&quot; a biographical film of the painter of the same name, and &quot;The Journey,&quot; a 14-hour essay film about nuclear disarmament.

The British Film Institute writes &quot;in an age when the media stranglehold on both our lives and the means by which we communicate is ever tightening, [Watkins] films remain a vital tool for considering new forms of image-making and a vibrant and engaging force in their own right.&quot;

==Early life==
Watkins was born in Norbiton, Surrey. During the Second World War, his family moved several times. After doing his National Service with the East Surrey Regiment, followed by studying acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Watkins began his television and film career as an assistant producer of short TV films and commercials; and in the early 1960s was an assistant editor and director of documentaries at the BBC.

== Career ==
All of his films have either been documentary or drama presented with documentary techniques, sometimes portraying historical occurrences and sometimes possible near future events as if contemporary reporters and filmmakers were there to interview the participants. Watkins pioneered this technique in his first full-length television film, &quot;Culloden&quot;, which portrayed the Jacobite uprising of 1746 in a style similar to the Vietnam War reporting of the time. In 1965, he won a Jacob&#x27;s Award for &quot;Culloden&quot; at the annual presentation ceremony in Dublin.

The scope and formal innovation of &quot;Culloden&quot; drew immediate critical acclaim for the previously unknown director, and the BBC commissioned him for another ambitious production, the nuclear-war docudrama &quot;The War Game&quot;, for &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; series. The production was subsequently released to cinemas and won the 1966 Academy Award for Documentary Feature, eventually being screened by the BBC on 31 July 1985 after a 20-year ban.

His reputation as a political provocateur was amplified by &quot;Punishment Park&quot;, a story of violent political conflict in the United States that coincided with the Kent State Massacre. Opposition to war is a common theme of his work, but the films&#x27; political messages are often ambiguous, usually allowing the main characters to present violently opposing viewpoints which in many cases are improvised by the cast: in &quot;Punishment Park&quot;, the soldiers and dissidents were played by nonprofessional actors whose political opinions matched those of their characters so well that the director said he feared actual violence would break out on set. He took a similar approach in his Paris Commune re-enactment &quot;La Commune&quot;, using newspaper advertisements to recruit conservative actors who would have a genuine antipathy to the Commune rebels. Watkins is also known for political statements about the film and television media, writing extensively about flaws in television news and the dominance of the Hollywood-derived narrative style that he refers to as &quot;the monoform&quot;.

After the banning of &quot;The War Game&quot; and the poor reception of his first non-television feature, &quot;Privilege&quot;, Watkins left England and has made all of his subsequent films abroad: &quot;The Gladiators&quot; in Sweden, &quot;Punishment Park&quot; in the United States, &quot;Edvard Munch&quot; in Norway, &quot;Evening Land&quot; in Denmark, &quot;Resan&quot; (a 14-hour film cycle about the threat of nuclear war) in ten different countries, and &quot;La Commune&quot; in France. &quot;Freethinker: The Life and Work of Peter Watkins&quot;, is a forthcoming biography by Patrick Murphy, a Senior Lecturer in Film and Television at York St John University, and John Cook. It is being compiled with Watkins&#x27; active help and participation.

In 2004, he wrote the book &quot;Media Crisis&quot;, which discusses his ideas of media hegemony which he calls, &quot;the monoform&quot;, and the lack of debate around the construction of new forms of audiovisual media.

== Influence ==
Citing their 1969 Bed-in efforts and Peace Concert, an interviewer asked John Lennon and Yoko Ono, &quot;Is there any one particular incident that got you started in this peace campaign?&quot;. John answered, &quot;...the thing that really struck it off was a letter we got from a guy called Peter Watkins who made a film called &quot;The War Game&quot;. It was a very long letter stating just what&#x27;s happening – how the media is really controlled, how it&#x27;s all run, and everything else that people really know deep down. He said &#x27;People in your position have a responsibility to use the media for world peace&#x27;. And we sat on the letter for about three weeks thinking &#x27;Well, we&#x27;re doing our best. All you need is love, man.&#x27; That letter just sort of sparked it all off. It was like getting your induction papers for peace!&quot;

== Personal life ==
Watkins has resided at various times in Canada, Lithuania, and France. He is married to Vida Urbonavičius, and has two sons, Patrick and Gerard.

In 1827, the National Road (now US 40) was laid through what is now New Concord, roughly following what had been the primitive roadway known as Zane&#x27;s Trace. A year later, the village of New Concord was established by Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. On July 9, 1836, the first recorded meeting of the &quot;Friends of Education&quot; in New Concord, led by residents Samuel Willson and Benjamin Waddle, was held. A year later, the Ohio General Assembly authorized the creation of a college in New Concord after being petitioned by the &quot;Friends of Education&quot; committee. On April 24, 1837, Muskingum College opened. Muskingum became a coeducational institution in 1854. In 1958, the United Presbyterian Church of North America and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America merged by signing a historic agreement in Brown Chapel on Muskingum&#x27;s campus. In 2001, the school&#x27;s women&#x27;s softball team captured the NCAA Division III National Championship, the school&#x27;s first national title.

In 2009, Muskingum College achieved university status to become Muskingum University.

==Academics==
Muskingum has been continuously accredited by the North Central Association of college and Secondary Schools or one of its successors since 1919. &quot;The school up on the hill&quot;, as it is sometimes called by locals, offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees at the undergraduate level, and at the graduate level Master of Information Strategy Systems and Technology, Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Arts in Teaching graduate degrees. The university offers 44 academic majors along with a large number of minors, nine pre-professional programs (including pre-law and pre-medicine) and teaching licensure.

==Campus==
Most of Muskingum&#x27;s academic buildings are clustered around a traditional quad near the southern part of the campus. The quad is bordered by Montgomery Hall and the College Library to the south, Caldwell Hall, Cambridge Hall and the Student/Faculty Center to the west, the Recreation Center and John Glenn Gym to the north and Boyd Science Center to the east. Brown Chapel sits on the southeastern corner of the quad.
* Paul Hall (1873) is the oldest building on Muskingum&#x27;s campus. Two previous versions of this building burnt down early in the school&#x27;s history. This third structure is named for Dr. David Paul, president of the college from 1865 to 1879. The building, which currently houses the art department, is registered as a National Historic Site.
* Johnson Hall (1899) is named for Dr. Jesse Johnson, Muskingum&#x27;s president from 1883 to 1902. Renovated in 1977, it contained art studios, the Louis Palmer Gallery and a 160-seat proscenium thrust theater. Johnson Hall was torn down in 2008.

==Fraternities and sororities==
The university has five active fraternities: Phi Kappa Tau, Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sigma, Ulster (local), and M.A.C.E. (local). The Muskingum chapters of Phi Kappa Tau and Kappa Sigma both trace their roots to local fraternities, Alban and Sphynx. The university also has four active sororities: Chi Alpha Nu (local), FAD (local), Delta Gamma Theta (local), and Theta Phi Alpha.

==Athletics==

Muskingum competes athletically in the NCAA as a Division III school and as one of the first and longest affiliated members of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC). M.U.&#x27;s teams compete under the name the &quot;Fighting Muskies&quot;. Its mascot is the Fighting Muskie (&quot;muskellunge&quot;), the largest member of the pike family.

Rather than using the traditional magenta, Muskies athletics wear black and red. The school&#x27;s main athletic rival is fellow OAC competitor the Marietta College Pioneers (which ironically was originally called the Muskingum Academy when established in 1797). Muskingum fields teams in American football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s volleyball, baseball, women&#x27;s softball, wrestling and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track, outdoor track, soccer, tennis, cross country, lacrosse, and golf.
Muskingum has won 79 Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) Championships, since the school joined the conference in 1923.

In the 41 seasons between 1926 and 1966, Muskingum won 12 OAC football championships, ten outright, and two shared. Six of those championships were won from 1945 to 1966 when the team was led by College Football Hall of Fame member Ed Sherman, a former Muskingum quarterback. In Sherman&#x27;s last three seasons, the Muskies represented the OAC in the Grantland Rice Bowl in 1964 and 1966.

==Notable alumni==
Collectively, Muskingum&#x27;s alumni are referred to as the &quot;Long Magenta Line&quot;.

Former astronaut and U.S. senator John Glenn grew up in New Concord and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering from Muskingum in 1943. He was awarded an honorary degree from Muskingum in 1961, and announced his retirement from the United States Senate in Brown Chapel live on national television in 1997. Upon his retirement, Glenn donated his archives to the Ohio State University, with special conditions that Muskingum students could benefit from the collection at any time.

<doc id="828348" wikidata="Q547102" url="?curid=828348" title="Edvard Munch (film)">
<text>Edvard Munch () is a 1974 biographical film about the Norwegian Expressionist painter Edvard Munch, written and directed by English filmmaker Peter Watkins. It was originally created as a three-part miniseries co-produced by the Norwegian and Swedish state television networks NRK and SVT, but subsequently gained an American theatrical release in a three-hour version in 1976. The film covers about thirty years of Munch&#x27;s life, focusing on the influences that shaped his art, particularly the prevalence of disease and death in his family and his youthful affair with a married woman. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn&#x27;t entered into the main competition.

==Style==
Like Watkins&#x27; other films, &quot;Edvard Munch&quot; uses a docudrama approach; scenes from Munch&#x27;s life are re-enacted by a large cast (mostly Norwegian non-professional actors), but there is also a voiceover narration by Watkins, and there are moments when the characters speak directly to camera, as if being interviewed about their own lives or their opinions of Munch. Some of the dialogue was improvised by the cast, especially in the interview segments. To convey the hostile response Munch&#x27;s work often received during his lifetime, Watkins recruited Norwegians who genuinely disliked the paintings.

==Distribution and responses==
After its initial broadcast, the film was briefly an international success but was not widely available for many years afterward. Watkins has said that network officials tried to suppress its distribution, and tried to bar it from competition in the Cannes Film Festival, because they disapproved of its use of non-professional actors and anachronistic dialogue. After NRK relinquished rights to the film in 2002, it gained a wider international release.

Ingmar Bergman called the film a &quot;work of genius&quot;.

<text>Stephen Kakfwi (born 1950 in Fort Good Hope, Northwest Territories) is a Canadian politician, who was the ninth premier of the Northwest Territories. His sixteen-year tenure in the cabinet of the Northwest Territories is the longest in the Territories&#x27; history.

== Early life ==
Stephen Kakfwi was born on 1950 in a traditional Dene bush camp at Fort Good Hope, Northwest Territories to full-blooded Slavey parents. His parents were non-status Slavey due to his grandfather waiving his treaty rights in order to own property and run a fur-trading business. At an early age, Kakfwi was sent away to residential schools in Inuvik, Yellowknife and Fort Smith. During the 1970s, Kakfwi attended the University of Alberta to complete a teacher&#x27;s degree, but early in that decade he returned to his Fort Good Hope community during a time in which many Aboriginal Canadians were beginning to organize politically to demand recognition of their land and self-government rights.

== Political career ==
In the 1970s the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline was proposed. Kakfwi identified the danger this proposal posed to his community&#x27;s homeland, and fought tirelessly against the proposal, organizing groups of Dene and Métis. Eventually, the Government of Canada established the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry, commissioned by Justice Thomas R. Berger. The 1977-8 recommendations against building a pipeline through the Northwest Territories for the time being were considered by Kakfwi as a &quot;political badge of honour&quot;.

In 1980 Kakfwi ran against Georges Erasmus for the Dene leadership, but lost. In 1983, Kakfwi again ran for the position of President of the Dene Nation and won, as Erasmus, his 1980 opponent, had been elected grand chief of the Assembly of First Nations. As President of the Dene Nation, Kakfwi established both the Northwest Territories Dene Cultural Institute and Indigenous Survival International (the latter was focused on hunting rights, particularly in the Arctic). He also aided in land rights efforts and helped to develop a framework for land claim negotiations. In 1984 and 1987, Pope John Paul II had scheduled visits to the Northwest Territories, an effort made possible by the work of Kakfwi. Although the 1984 visit was subsequently cancelled due to poor weather, Kakfwi continued to campaign for a visit in 1987.

In 1987, Kakfwi was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, representing the constituency of Sahtu, of 254,000 square kilometres in area. During his sixteen-year tenure in the Legislative Assembly, ending in 2003, Kakfwi played key roles in initiatives ranging from economic development by encouraging the creation of diamond cutting and polishing industries in close proximity to local diamond mines, through to his promotion of Aboriginal rights, especially during his term as Premier of the Northwest Territories from 2000 to 2003. His sixteen-year tenure in the cabinet of the Northwest Territories is the longest in the Territories&#x27; history. Kakfwi continues to play an active role in the development of the Northwest Territories through his advisory position to WWF Canada.

In 2014, he founded Canadians for a New Partnership, a coalition with a goal to build a new partnership between First Peoples and all Canadians.

In 2017, Kakfwi was appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to serve on the Supreme Court Advisory Board. The board&#x27;s mandate was to recommend a successor to Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin before her retirement later that year.

==Awards==
In 1997, Kakfwi was awarded the National Aboriginal Achievement Award for public service for his leadership role in Northern Canada.

In October 2013, he was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s Northern Medal by David Johnston.

== Personal life==
Kakfwi is married to Marie Wilson and has three children and four grandchildren.

<text>Opatówek is a town of 3,800 inhabitants in central Poland, situated southeast from Kalisz, in the Kalisz County in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. The commune (Gmina) of Opatówek, including the town of Opatówek and 26 other villages, has about 10,000 inhabitants and is an agricultural and industrial region. (&quot;See also Commune Opatówek&quot;.)

== Region ==
The commune is situated in a picturesque landscape of the Opatówek-Malanów Hills. The hills of Chełmce (187 m), Rajsko (177.2 m) and Tłokinia Kościelna (164.7 m) dominate the valleys of rivers Pokrzywnica, Cienia and Swędrnia. The neighbour comunes of the commune Opatówek are: Żelazków, Ceków-Kolonia and Koźminek in the north, Szczytniki in the east, Godziesze Wielkie in the south and the city of Kalisz in the west.

The architecture of Opatówek is dominated by the Neo-Gothic and classicistic style of the 19th century the most successful time of the town during the booming years of the Industrial Revolution.

== History ==

===Early settlements===
After early Celtic settlements the region was settled between 400 BC and 300 AD by Lugii. Kalisz was an important station of the Amber Road called Calisia.

===Medieval and modern times===
Opatówek belonged to archbishops of Gniezno since the 13th century, who probably helped it to obtain municipal rights. The archbishop Jarosław of Bogoria and Skotnik built a brick church and a castle here in about 1360, which were visited by outstanding clergymen and civil dignitaries. Both buildings stood until the beginning of the 19th century. It was a private church town, administratively located in the Kalisz County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. From 1655 until 1660 the area was occupied by Sweden during the Deluge. In 1706 was the great battle close to Kalisz between Saxon and Swedish armies that involved 50,000 soldiers all together. The Saxon army helped by the Russian army defeated Swedish army and Polish soldiers led by Stanisław Leszczyński.
In 1793, following the Second Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by Prussia, and the archbishops&#x27; property was confiscated by the Prussian authorities. In 1807, the town was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. Since 1807 it belonged to general Józef Zajączek, the future governor of the Congress Poland. In that time many buildings designed by the most outstanding architects were constructed; moreover, the governor carried out reforms in his property which enabled the economical development in this area.

Also Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée passed the Kalisz County at the French invasion of Russia (1812). After the Vienna Congress 1815, the area became part of so-called Congress Poland in the Russian Partition.

===Industrial Revolution and the 19th century===
Beginning of the 19th century the industrial revolution did not stop at Poland. Several German industrialist&#x27;s started running branches cross border. Cities on both sides of the border started booming.

With the foundation of the big weaving mill by Adolf Gottlieb Fiedler, a Saxon industrialist, Opatówek started booming. Fiedler established one of the biggest weaving mills in Congress Poland in 1824–1826. The government of Congress Poland created very good conditions for the development of industry. Adolf Gottlieb Fiedler received a big loan from the Polish government to build the factory in Opatowek. Also in spite of lower salaries he followed other cloth producers to eastern regions at the time of the German Industrial Revolution. The German investments in Poland were followed by Saxon and Bohemian specialists to run the factories. There they found cheap workers, water power and they brought in their know-how. The factory of Opatówek employed 600 workers and the company won several international prizes with their products. The Opatówek factory was the cash cow of Fiedler&#x27;s company. The town grew with great speed.
During the January Uprising, on February 25, 1863, it was the site of a battle between Polish insurgents and Russian troops, which ended in a Polish victory. In 1870, Opatówek lost its municipal rights as a result of the suppression after the January Uprising and because of the economical decay. In the end of the 19th century a Wooden Toys Factory was established in Opatowek, whose products won numerous prizes at European expositions. The profit-making, well organised property yielded a big profit to the next owners.

===The 20th century===
At the end of 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, Opatówek was, like most cities of Greater Poland, touched by independence movements against Prussia and Russia. After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of Opatówek.

After the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, it was occupied by Germany until 1945. There have been several resistance movements, most of them were detected by the Gestapo.

After World War II there have been several regional changes. During the Gomułka government (1956–1970) the economy of the whole region stood still, not only because of the iron curtain. The following government, that of Edward Gierek, brought fresh wind into the region and economy grew again. Since 1990 the Third Polish Republic was founded. All Polish provinces were restructured again and Opatówek became part of Kalisz County in the restructured province Greater Poland.

=== Today ===
Nowadays there are about 800 private firms in the commune of Opatówek. They deal with production, trade or services. The Bank Spółdzielczy Ziemi Kaliskiej and a branch of the PKO Bank deal with financial service of the inhabitants, institutions and firms. In 1998 the Garden and Agriculture Fair &quot;Pamiętajcie o ogrodach&quot; took place in Opatówek for the first time. The local gardeners and fruit-growers, as well as exhibitors from all over the country and abroad participate in it every year. In 2001 the seventh Country-wide Youth Games for Summer Sports &quot;Wielkopolska 2001&quot; was inaugurated at the artificial lake in Szałe. The commune Opatówek was the host of the rowing and mountain cycling competition. The following Games for Water sports took place in summer 2004. The lake can be visited on board of the tourist ship &quot;Opatówek&quot;. The commune is represented every year by the football team &quot;Sparta&quot; at the regional competition. In 2006 a modern sports hall has been built where the national and international volleyball matches were held.
Since 1 January 2017 Opatówek gain back their municipal rights.

== Cultural offerings ==

=== Museum ===

The Museum of the History of Industry features a collection showing the development of industry in the Kalisz region since the beginning of the 19th century. It also contains the biggest collection of pianos and fortepianos produced on the Polish territory of Poland (in the historic building of former cloth factory). The museum was put down on the International Committee for Preservation of Industrial Heritage list.

<text>Garri Aiba (; died 9 June 2004) was an opposition leader in Abkhazia at the time of his murder. He died when his car came under fire on 9 June 2004.

== History ==
Garri Aiba was a veteran of the 1992-1993 war with Georgia, in which he led Abkhazia anti-aircraft defenses, and a prominent businessman. From 1995 to 2000 he had been mayor of Sokhumi, capital of Abkhazia.
Aiba had become one of the leaders of Amtsakhara, which was one of the main movements in opposition to the government of President Vladislav Ardzinba, two other leaders of which had also been killed in previous years.

== Murder ==
On 9 June 2004, Aiba&#x27;s car came under fire, fifty metres from his home in Sokhumi. He got out of the car in an attempt to protect his ten-year-old daughter, but was seriously injured, and died later that day in the hospital. His death sent shockwaves through Abkhaz politics. Aiba had no business links and many people claimed that the killing was politically motivated. It sparked the resignations of several prominent ministers, including foreign minister (and fellow Amtsakhara leader) Sergey Shamba, interior minister Abessalom Beiya and Givi Agrba, head of the security services. However, Shamba later denied that his resignation was related to Aiba&#x27;s death, and Prime Minister Raul Khadjimba refused to accept the resignations of Beiya and Agrba.

No one has yet been charged with Aiba&#x27;s murder. Former opposition leader Sergei Bagapsh has since become president.

<text>The Federal University of São Carlos (, UFSCar) is a public research university located in São Carlos, state of São Paulo, Brazil.

== History ==
On December 13, 1960, a federal statute determined the creation of a university in São Carlos. On December 1, 1968, a presidential decree was enacted to create that university and a commission was formed to coordinate the project. The result was the Federal University of São Carlos, the first federal university in São Paulo state.

Thancham&#x27;s farm, localized on the border of Washington Luís highway, was chosen as the initial site. Farm buildings were adapted to provide administration, classrooms, and laboratories. In March 1970, it received its first 96 students for the science and materials engineering degree.

The university started with a strong emphasis on natural sciences. This profile changed during the 1990s, when UFSCar created more courses, departments, and added graduate programs in the humanities.

The first three academic centers were created in the 1970s. The Center for Science and Technology (CCET, in Portuguese) and the Center for Life Sciences and Health (CCBS, in Portuguese), the Education Centre and Human Sciences (CECH, in Portuguese) along with the undergraduate Biological Sciences degree were created in 1972. The first health program, undergraduate Nursing, deployed in 1977. In 1994 an undergraduate program in Physical Education began.

By the end of the 80s, the humanities professors were linked mainly to the Department of Scientific and Philosophical Foundations of Education. The university also hosted the Departments of Social Sciences, Education, philosophy, Educational Methodology and Psychology.

The Social Sciences undergraduate course began in 1991; Psychology and Library and Information Science opened in 1994; Literature and Image and Sound came in 1996, and Bachelor of Music with specialization in Music Education started in 2004.

In 2008, UFSCar adopted the federal plan to restructure and expand the public universities. Since then, it has increased the number of campuses, undergraduate and graduate courses and staff.

==Academics==
UFSCar offers 64 undergraduate degrees and maintains 52 graduate programs. It has an enrollment of approximately 26,000 students and 1,300 professors and researchers. 99.8% of its teaching staff are PhDs or Masters.

Through ENEM, the national test for graduating high school students, the university offers 2,897 undergraduate positions each year.

=== Rankings ===
UFSCar is ranked among the 10 best universities in Brazil according to Folha de S.Paulo&#x27;s University Ranking. The Brazilian Ministry of Education gave UFSCar the maximum score for its teaching quality. Times Higher Education ranked UFSCar in 16th place on its Latin America University Rankings.

== Campuses ==
The University has four campuses: São Carlos, Araras, Sorocaba and Lagoa do Sino.

=== São Carlos campus ===
The UFSCar&#x27;s main campus, located in São Carlos, occupies an area of 645 hectares (1,590 acres). Its infrastructure includes 300 laboratories, one library with more than 280,000 books, one clinic, two theatres, nine lecture halls, 12 auditoriums, one gymnasium, one sports park, seven courts, two pools, one university restaurant, four snack bars, 124 classrooms and 672 vacancies internal and external student housing.

Located inside main campus, there is an area of about 672 hectares (1,660 acres) of cerrado, of which almost 30% are composed of preserved vegetation. That area is used for teaching and research. The University also promotes monitored visits in the area.

Because there is currently only 1% of the original cerrado vegetation that existed in the state of São Paulo (due to agriculture and cattle ranching), preservation turn places like this into animal refuges. In the area there are armadillos, deers, capybaras and other rodents, marmosets, and a great diversity of birds. There are also records of the presence of tatuis, anteater, and brown jaguars. More than 30 new species of aquatic insects have been discovered in this area.

=== Araras campus ===
The Araras campus occupies an area of 243 hectares (600 acres). Its infrastructure includes 28 laboratories divided between teaching and research, 22 classrooms, one library, one clinic, one amphitheater, one court, one aquatic center, one university restaurant, one snack bar and 33 external vacancies in student housing. Approximately 1,000 students visit the place.

=== Sorocaba campus ===
The Sorocaba campus has 70 hectares (173 acres) of area with 44 laboratories, one library, one clinic, two auditoriums, one sports court, one university restaurant, one snack bar, 29 classrooms, one football field with running track and 80 external vacancies of student housing.

=== Lagoa do Sino campus ===
The Lagoa do Sino campus is located in Buri and occupies an area of 1 hectare (2.47 acres). Its infrastructure includes ten laboratories, one computer lab, one library, one university restaurant, one snack bar and eleven classrooms.

<text>Pyra Labs is a subsidiary of Google (Alphabet) that created the Blogger service in 1999. Google acquired Pyra Labs in 2003.

==History==
Pyra was co-founded by Evan Williams and Meg Hourihan. The company&#x27;s first product, also named &quot;Pyra&quot;, was a web application which would combine a project manager, contact manager, and to-do list. Their coder Paul Bausch altered an ftp program to work on a webpage, enabling online users to upload to a webpage web-log. In 1999, while still in beta, the rudiments of Pyra were repurposed into an in-house tool which became Blogger. The service was made available to the public in August 1999. Much of this coding was done by Paul Bausch and Matthew Haughey.

Initially, Blogger was completely free of charge and there was no revenue model. In January 2001, Pyra asked Blogger users for donations to buy a new server. When the company&#x27;s seed money dried up around the same time, the employees continued without pay for weeks or, in some cases, months; but this could not last, and eventually Williams faced a mass walk-out by everyone including co-founder Hourihan. Williams ran the company virtually alone until he was able to secure an investment by Trellix after its founder Dan Bricklin became aware of Pyra&#x27;s situation. Eventually advertising-supported Blogspot and Blogger Pro emerged.

In 2002, Blogger was completely re-written to license it to other companies, the first of which was Globo.com of Brazil.

On February 17, 2003, Pyra was acquired by Google for an undisclosed sum.

<text>A QR code, quick-response code, is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode invented in 1994 by Masahiro Hara of Japanese company Denso Wave for labelling automobile parts. It features black squares on a white background with fiducial markers, readable by imaging devices like cameras, and processed using Reed–Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in both the horizontal and the vertical components of the QR image.

Whereas a barcode is a machine-readable optical image that contains information specific to the labeled item, the QR code contains the data for a locator, an identifier, and web-tracking. To store data efficiently, QR codes use four standardized modes of encoding:
: (1) numeric,
: (2) alphanumeric,
: (3) byte or binary, and
: (4) kanji.
Compared to standard UPC barcodes, the QR labeling system was applied beyond the automobile industry because of faster reading of the optical image and greater data-storage capacity in applications such as product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.

== History ==
The QR code system was invented in 1994, at the Denso Wave automotive products company, in Japan. The initial alternating-square design presented by the team of researchers, headed by Masahiro Hara, was influenced by the black counters and the white counters played on a Go board; the pattern of the position detection markers was determined by finding the least-used sequence of alternating black-white areas on printed matter, which was found to be (1:1:3:1:1). The functional purpose of the QR code system was to facilitate keeping track of the types and numbers of automobile parts, by replacing individually-scanned bar-code labels on each box of auto parts with a single label that contained the data of each label. The quadrangular configuration of the QR code system consolidated the data of the various bar-code labels with Kanji, Kana, and alphanumeric codes printed onto a single label.

== Adoption ==
 QR codes are used in a much broader context, including both commercial tracking applications and convenience-oriented applications aimed at mobile phone users (termed mobile tagging). QR codes may be used to display text to the user, to open a webpage on the user&#x27;s device, to add a vCard contact to the user&#x27;s device, to open a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), to connect to a wireless network, or to compose an email or text message. There are a great many QR code generators available as software or as online tools that are either free or require a paid subscription. The QR code has become one of the most-used types of two-dimensional code.

During June 2011, 14 million American mobile users scanned a QR code or a barcode. Some 58% of those users scanned a QR or barcode from their homes, while 39% scanned from retail stores; 53% of the 14 million users were men between the ages of 18 and 34.

In 2022, 89 million people in the United States scanned a QR code using their mobile devices, up by 26 percent compared to 2020. The majority of QR code users used them to make payments or to access product and menu information.

In September 2020, a survey found that 18.8 percent of consumers in the United States and the United Kingdom strongly agreed that they had noticed an increase in QR code use since the then-active COVID-19-related restrictions had begun several months prior.

== Standards ==
Several standards cover the encoding of data as QR codes:
*October 1997AIM (Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility) International
* January 1999JIS X 0510
* June 2000ISO/IEC 18004:2000 &quot;Information technologyAutomatic identification and data capture techniquesBar code symbologyQR code&quot; (now withdrawn) Defines QR code models 1 and 2 symbols.
* 1 September 2006ISO/IEC 18004:2006 &quot;Information technologyAutomatic identification and data capture techniquesQR Code 2005 bar code symbology specification&quot; (now withdrawn) Defines QR code 2005 symbols, an extension of QR code model 2. Does not specify how to read QR code model 1 symbols, or require this for compliance.
* 1 February 2015ISO/IEC 18004:2015 &quot;InformationAutomatic identification and data capture techniquesQR Code barcode symbology specification&quot; Renames the QR Code 2005 symbol to QR Code and adds clarification to some procedures and minor corrections.
* May 2022ISO/IEC 23941:2022 &quot;Information technologyAutomatic identification and data capture techniquesRectangular Micro QR Code (rMQR) bar code symbology specification&quot;Defines the requirements for Micro QR Code.

At the application layer, there is some variation between most of the implementations. Japan&#x27;s NTT DoCoMo has established de facto standards for the encoding of URLs, contact information, and several other data types. The open-source &quot;ZXing&quot; project maintains a list of QR code data types.

== Uses ==

QR codes have become common in consumer advertising. Typically, a smartphone is used as a QR code scanner, displaying the code and converting it to some useful form (such as a standard URL for a website, thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a Web browser).

QR codes have become a focus of advertising strategy to provide a way to access a brand&#x27;s website more quickly than by manually entering a URL. Beyond mere convenience to the consumer, the importance of this capability is the belief that it increases the conversion rate: the chance that contact with the advertisement will convert to a sale. It coaxes interested prospects further down the conversion funnel with little delay or effort, bringing the viewer to the advertiser&#x27;s website immediately, whereas a longer and more targeted sales pitch may lose the viewer&#x27;s interest.

Although initially used to track parts in vehicle manufacturing, QR codes are used over a much wider range of applications. These include commercial tracking, warehouse stock control, entertainment and transport ticketing, product and loyalty marketing, and in-store product labeling. Examples of marketing include where a company&#x27;s discounted and percent discount can be captured using a QR code decoder that is a mobile app, or storing a company&#x27;s information such as address and related information alongside its alpha-numeric text data as can be seen in telephone directory yellow pages.

They can also be used to store personal information for organizations. An example of this is the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) where NBI clearances now come with a QR code. Many of these applications target mobile-phone users (via mobile tagging). Users may receive text, add a vCard contact to their device, open a URL, or compose an e-mail or text message after scanning QR codes. They can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting one of several pay or free QR code-generating sites or apps. Google had an API, now deprecated, to generate QR codes, and apps for scanning QR codes can be found on nearly all smartphone devices.

QR codes storing addresses and URLs may appear in magazines, on signs, on buses, on business cards, or on almost any object about which users might want information. Users with a camera phone equipped with the correct reader application can scan the image of the QR code to display text and contact information, connect to a wireless network, or open a web page in the phone&#x27;s browser. This act of linking from physical world objects is termed hardlinking or object hyperlinking. QR codes also may be linked to a location to track where a code has been scanned. Either the application that scans the QR code retrieves the geo information by using GPS and cell tower triangulation (aGPS) or the URL encoded in the QR code itself is associated with a location. In 2008, a Japanese stonemason announced plans to engrave QR codes on gravestones, allowing visitors to view information about the deceased, and family members to keep track of visits. Psychologist Richard Wiseman was one of the first authors to include QR codes in a book, in &quot;&quot; (2011). Microsoft Office and LibreOffice have a functionality to insert QR code into documents.

QR codes have been incorporated into currency. In June 2011, The Royal Dutch Mint (&quot;Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt&quot;) issued the world&#x27;s first official coin with a QR code to celebrate the centenary of its current building and premises. The coin can be scanned by a smartphone and originally linked to a special website with content about the historical event and design of the coin. In 2014, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a 100-naira banknote to commemorate its centennial, the first banknote to incorporate a QR code in its design. When scanned with an internet-enabled mobile device, the code goes to a website that tells the centenary story of Nigeria.

In 2015, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation issued a 100-rubles note to commemorate the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. It contains a QR code into its design, and when scanned with an internet-enabled mobile device, the code goes to a website that details the historical and technical background of the commemorative note. In 2017, the Bank of Ghana issued a 5-cedis banknote to commemorate 60 years of central banking in Ghana. It contains a QR code in its design which, when scanned with an internet-enabled mobile device, goes to the official Bank of Ghana website.

Credit card functionality is under development. In September 2016, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) launched the eponymously named BharatQR, a common QR code jointly developed by all the four major card payment companies – National Payments Corporation of India that runs RuPay cards along with Mastercard, Visa, and American Express. It will also have the capability of accepting payments on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

=== Augmented reality ===
QR codes are used in some augmented reality systems to determine the positions of objects in 3-dimensional space.

=== Mobile operating systems ===
QR codes can be used on various mobile device operating systems. While initially requiring the installation and use of third-party apps, both Android and iOS (since iOS 11) devices can now natively scan QR codes, without requiring an external app to be used. The camera app can scan and display the kind of QR code along with the link. These devices support URL redirection, which allows QR codes to send metadata to existing applications on the device.

=== Virtual stores ===
QR codes have been used to establish &quot;virtual stores&quot;, where a gallery of product information and QR codes is presented to the customer, e.g. on a train station wall. The customers scan the QR codes, and the products are delivered to their homes. This use started in South Korea, and Argentina, but is currently expanding globally. Walmart, Procter &amp; Gamble and Woolworths have already adopted the Virtual Store concept.

=== QR code payment ===

QR codes can be used to store bank account information or credit card information, or they can be specifically designed to work with particular payment provider applications. There are several trial applications of QR code payments across the world. In developing countries including China, India QR code payment is a very popular and convenient method of making payments. Since Alipay designed a QR code payment method in 2011, mobile payment has been quickly adopted in China. As of 2018, around 83% of all payments were made via mobile payment.

In November 2012, QR code payments were deployed on a larger scale in the Czech Republic when an open format for payment information exchange – a Short Payment Descriptor – was introduced and endorsed by the Czech Banking Association as the official local solution for QR payments. In 2013, the European Payment Council provided guidelines for the EPC QR code enabling SCT initiation within the Eurozone.

In 2017, Singapore created a task force including government agencies such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority to spearhead a system for e-payments using standardized QR code specifications. These specific dimensions are specialized for Singapore.

The e-payment system, Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR), essentially merges various QR codes into one label that can be used by both parties in the payment system. This allows for various banking apps to facilitate payments between multiple customers and a merchant that displays a single QR code. The SGQR scheme is co-owned by MAS and IMDA. A single SDQR label contains e-payments and combines multiple payment options. People making purchases can scan the code and see which payment options the merchant accepts.

=== Website login ===
QR codes can be used to log into websites: a QR code is shown on the login page on a computer screen, and when a registered user scans it with a verified smartphone, they will automatically be logged in. Authentication is performed by the smartphone, which contacts the server. Google deployed such a login scheme in 2012.

=== Mobile ticket ===
There is a system whereby a QR code can be displayed on a device such as a smartphone and used as an admission ticket. Its use is common for J1 League and Nippon Professional Baseball tickets in Japan. In some cases, rights can be transferred via the Internet. In Latvia, QR codes can be scanned in Riga public transport to validate Rīgas Satiksme e-tickets.

=== Restaurant ordering ===
Restaurants can present a QR code near the front door or at the table allowing guests to view an online menu, or even redirect them to an online ordering website or app, allowing them to order and/or possibly pay for their meal without having to use a cashier or waiter. QR codes can also link to daily or weekly specials that are not printed on the standardized menus, and enable the establishment to update the entire menu without needing to print copies. At table-serve restaurants, QR codes enable guests to order and pay for their meals without a waiter involved – the QR code contains the table number so servers know where to bring the food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verge, Kastrenakes, 9/29/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This application has grown especially since the need for social distancing during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic prompted reduced contact between service staff and customers.

=== Joining a Wi‑Fi network ===

By specifying the SSID, encryption type, password/passphrase, and if the SSID is hidden or not, mobile device users can quickly scan and join networks without having to manually enter the data. A MeCard-like format is supported by Android and iOS 11+.

* Common format: codice_1
* Sample: codice_2

=== Funerary use ===
A QR code can link to an obituary and can be placed on a headstone. In 2008, Ishinokoe in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan began to sell tombstones with QR codes produced by IT DeSign, where the code leads to a virtual grave site of the deceased. Other companies, such as Wisconsin-based Interactive Headstones, have also begun implementing QR codes into tombstones. In 2014, the Jewish Cemetery of La Paz in Uruguay began implementing QR codes for tombstones.

=== Electronic authentication ===
QR codes can be used to generate time-based one-time passwords for electronic authentication.

=== Loyalty programs===
QR codes have been used by various retail outlets that have loyalty programs. Sometimes these programs are accessed with an app that is loaded onto a phone and includes a process triggered by a QR code scan. The QR codes for loyalty programs tend to be found printed on the receipt for a purchase or on the products themselves. Users in these schemes collect award points by scanning a code.

=== Counterfeit detection ===
Serialised QR codes have been used by brands and governments to let consumers, retailers and distributors verify the authenticity of the products and help with detecting counterfeit products, as part of a brand protection program. However, the security level of a regular QR code is limited since QR codes printed on original products are easily reproduced on fake products, even though the analysis of data generated as a result of QR code scanning can be used to detect counterfeiting and illicit activity. A higher security level can be attained by embedding a digital watermark or copy detection pattern into the image of the QR code. This makes the QR code more secure against counterfeiting attempts; products that display a code which is counterfeit, although valid as a QR code, can be detected by scanning the secure QR code with the appropriate app.

The treaty regulating apostilles (documents bearing a seal of authenticity), has been updated to allow the issuance of digital apostilles by countries; a digital apostille is a PDF document with a cryptographic signature containing a QR code for a canonical URL of the original document, allowing users to verify the apostille from a printed version of the document.

=== Product tracing ===

Different studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of QR codes as a means of conveying labelling information and their use as part of a food traceability system. In a field experiment, it was found that when provided free access to a smartphone with a QR code scanning app, 52.6% of participants would use it to access labelling information. A study made in South Korea showed that consumers appreciate QR code used in food traceability system, as they provide detailed information about food, as well as information that helps them in their purchasing decision. If QR codes are serialised, consumers can access a web page showing the supply chain for each ingredient, as well as information specific to each related batch, including meat processors and manufacturers, which helps address the concerns they have about the origin of their food.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

After the COVID-19 pandemic began spreading, QR codes began to be used as a &quot;touchless&quot; system to display information, show menus, or provide updated consumer information, especially in the hospitality industry. Restaurants replaced paper or laminated plastic menus with QR code decals on the table, which opened an online version of the menu. This prevented the need to dispose of single-use paper menus, or institute cleaning and sanitizing procedures for permanent menus after each use. Local television stations have also begun to utilize codes on local newscasts to allow viewers quicker access to stories or information involving the pandemic, including testing and immunization scheduling websites, or for links within stories mentioned in the newscasts overall.

In Australia, patrons were required to scan QR codes at shops, clubs, supermarkets, and other service and retail establishments on entry to assist contact tracing. Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand used similar systems.

QR codes are also present on COVID-19 vaccination certificates in places such as Canada and the EU (EU Digital COVID certificate), where they can be scanned to verify the information on the certificate.

== Design ==
Unlike the older, one-dimensional barcodes that were designed to be mechanically scanned by a narrow beam of light, a QR code is detected by a two-dimensional digital image sensor and then digitally analyzed by a programmed processor. The processor locates the three distinctive squares at the corners of the QR code image, using a smaller square (or multiple squares) near the fourth corner to normalize the image for size, orientation, and angle of viewing. The small dots throughout the QR code are then converted to binary numbers and validated with an error-correcting algorithm.

=== Information capacity ===
The amount of data that can be represented by a QR code symbol depends on the data type (&quot;mode&quot;, or input character set), version (1, ..., 40, indicating the overall dimensions of the symbol, i.e. 4 × version number + 17 dots on each side), and error correction level. The maximum storage capacities occur for version 40 and error correction level L (low), denoted by 40-L:

Here are some samples of QR codes:
=== Error correction ===

QR codes use Reed–Solomon error correction over the finite field formula_1 or , the elements of which are encoded as bytes of 8 bits; the byte formula_2 with a standard numerical value formula_3 encodes the field element formula_4 where formula_5 is taken to be a primitive element satisfying formula_6. The primitive polynomial is formula_7, corresponding to the polynomial number 285, with initial root = 0 to obtain generator polynomials.

The Reed–Solomon code uses one of 37 different polynomials over formula_1, with degrees ranging from 7 to 68, depending on how many error correction bytes the code adds. It is implied by the form of Reed–Solomon used (systematic BCH view) that these polynomials are all on the form formula_9. However, the rules for selecting the degree formula_10 are specific to the QR standard.

For example, the generator polynomial used for the Version 1 QR code (21×21), when 7 error correction bytes are used, is: 
formula_11.

This is obtained by multiplying the first seven terms:
formula_12.

The same may also be expressed using decimal coefficients (over formula_1), as:
formula_14.

The highest power of formula_15 in the polynomial (the degree formula_10, of the polynomial) determines the number of error correction bytes. In this case, the degree is 7.

When discussing the Reed–Solomon code phase there is some risk for confusion, in that the QR ISO/IEC standard uses the term &quot;codeword&quot; for the elements of formula_1, which with respect to the Reed–Solomon code are symbols, whereas it uses the term &quot;block&quot; for what with respect to the Reed–Solomon code are the codewords. The number of data versus error correction bytes within each block depends on (i) the version (side length) of the QR symbol and (ii) the error correction level, of which there are four. The higher the error correction level, the less storage capacity. The following table lists the approximate error correction capability at each of the four levels:

In larger QR symbols, the message is broken up into several Reed–Solomon code blocks. The block size is chosen so that no attempt is made at correcting more than 15 errors per block; this limits the complexity of the decoding algorithm. The code blocks are then interleaved together, making it less likely that localized damage to a QR symbol will overwhelm the capacity of any single block.

The Version 1 QR symbol with level L error correction, for example, consists of a single error correction block with a total of 26 code bytes (made of 19 message bytes and seven error correction bytes). It can correct up to 2 byte errors. Hence, this code is known as a (26,19,2) error correction code over . It is also sometimes represented in short, as (26,19) code.

Due to error correction, it is possible to create artistic QR codes with embellishments to make them more readable or attractive to the human eye, and to incorporate colors, logos, and other features into the QR code block; the embellishments are treated as errors, but the codes still scan correctly.

It is also possible to design artistic QR codes without reducing the error correction capacity by manipulating the underlying mathematical constructs. Image processing algorithms are also used to reduce errors in QR-code.

=== Encoding ===
====Format information and masking====
The format information records two things: the error correction level and the mask pattern used for the symbol. Masking is used to break up patterns in the data area that might confuse a scanner, such as large blank areas or misleading features that look like the locator marks. The mask patterns are defined on a grid that is repeated as necessary to cover the whole symbol. Modules corresponding to the dark areas of the mask are inverted. The 5-bit format information is protected from errors with a BCH code, and two complete copies are included in each QR symbol. A (15,5) triple error-correcting BCH code over is used, having the generator polynomial formula_18. It can correct at most 3 bit-errors out of the 5 data bits. There are a total of 15 bits in this BCH code (10 bits are added for error correction). This 15-bit code is itself X-ORed with a fixed 15-bit mask pattern (101010000010010) to prevent an all-zero string.

====Error correction bytes====
To obtain the error correction (EC) bytes for a message &quot;www.wikipedia.org&quot;, the following procedure may be carried out:

The message is 17 bytes long, hence it can be encoded using a (26,19,2) Reed-Solomon code to fit in a Ver1 (21×21) symbol, which has a maximum capacity of 19 bytes (for L level error correction).

The generator polynomial specified for the (26,19,2) code, is:
formula_14,
which may also be written in the form of a matrix of decimal coefficients:
 [1 127 122 154 164 11 68 117]

The 17-byte long message &quot;www.wikipedia.org&quot; as hexadecimal coefficients (ASCII values), denoted by M1 through M17 is:
 [77 77 77 2E 77 69 6B 69 70 65 64 69 61 2E 6F 72 67]

The encoding mode is &quot;Byte encoding&quot;. Hence the &#x27;Enc&#x27; field is [0100] (4 bits). The length of the above message is 17 bytes hence &#x27;Len&#x27; field is [00010001] (8 bits). The &#x27;End&#x27; field is End of message marker [0000] (4 bits).

The message code word (without EC bytes) is of the form:
 [&#x27;Enc&#x27; &#x27;Len&#x27; w w w . w i k i p e d i a . o r g &#x27;End&#x27;]
Substituting the hexadecimal values, it can be expressed as:
 [4 11 77 77 77 2E 77 69 6B 69 70 65 64 69 61 2E 6F 72 67 0]
This is rearranged as 19-byte blocks of 8 bits each:
 [41 17 77 77 72 E7 76 96 B6 97 06 56 46 96 12 E6 F7 26 70]
Using the procedure for Reed-Solomon systematic encoding, the 7 EC bytes obtained (E1 through E7, as shown in the symbol) which are the coefficients (in decimal) of the remainder after polynomial division are: 
 [174 173 239 6 151 143 37]
or in hexadecimal values:
 [AE AD EF 06 97 8F 25]
These 7 EC bytes are then appended to the 19-byte message. The resulting coded message has 26 bytes (in hexadecimal):
 [41 17 77 77 72 E7 76 96 B6 97 06 56 46 96 12 E6 F7 26 70 AE AD EF 06 97 8F 25]

Note: The bit values shown in the Ver1 QR symbol below do not match with the above values, as the symbol has been masked using a mask pattern (001).

====Message placement====
The message dataset is placed from right to left in a zigzag pattern, as shown below. In larger symbols, this is complicated by the presence of the alignment patterns and the use of multiple interleaved error-correction blocks.

The general structure of a QR encoding is as a sequence of 4 bit indicators with payload length dependent on the indicator mode (e.g. byte encoding payload length is dependent on the first byte).

Four-bit indicators are used to select the encoding mode and convey other information.

Encoding modes can be mixed as needed within a QR symbol. (e.g., a url with a long string of alphanumeric characters )
[ Mode Indicator][ Mode bitstream ] --&gt; [ Mode Indicator][ Mode bitstream ] --&gt; etc... --&gt; [ 0000 End of message (Terminator) ]
After every indicator that selects an encoding mode is a length field that tells how many characters are encoded in that mode. The number of bits in the length field depends on the encoding and the symbol version.

Alphanumeric encoding mode stores a message more compactly than the byte mode can, but cannot store lower-case letters and has only a limited selection of punctuation marks, which are sufficient for rudimentary web addresses. Two characters are coded in an 11-bit value by this formula:
:V = 45 × C1 + C2
This has the exception that the last character in an alphanumeric string with an odd length is read as a 6-bit value instead.

=== Decoding example ===

The following images offer more information about the QR code.


== Variants ==
=== Model 1 ===

&quot;Model 1 QR code&quot; is an older version of the specification. It is visually similar to the widely seen model 2 codes, but lacks alignment patterns. Differences are in the bottom right corner, and in the midsections of the bottom and right edges are additional functional regions.
=== Micro QR code ===

Micro QR code is a smaller version of the QR code standard for applications where symbol size is limited. There are four different versions (sizes) of Micro QR codes: the smallest is 11×11 modules; the largest can hold 35 numeric characters, or 21 ASCII alphanumeric characters, or 15 bytes (128 bits).
=== Rectangular Micro QR Code ===
Rectangular Micro QR Code (also known as rMQR Code) is a two-dimensional (2D) matrix barcode invented and standardized in 2022 by Denso Wave as ISO/IEC 23941. rMQR Code is designed as a rectangular variation of the QR code and has the same parameters and applications as original QR codes; however, rMQR Code is more suitable for rectangular areas, and has a difference between width and height up to 19 in the R7x139 version.
=== iQR code ===
iQR code is an alternative to existing square QR codes developed by Denso Wave. iQR codes can be created in square or rectangular formations; this is intended for situations where a longer and narrower rectangular shape is more suitable, such as on cylindrical objects. iQR codes can fit the same amount of information in 30% less space. There are 61 versions of square iQR codes, and 15 versions of rectangular codes. For squares, the minimum size is 9 × 9 modules; rectangles have a minimum of 19 × 5 modules. iQR codes add error correction level S, which allows for 50% error correction. iQR Codes had not been given an ISO/IEC specification as of 2015, and only proprietary Denso Wave products could create or read iQR codes.
=== Secure QR code ===
Secure Quick Response (SQR) code is a QR code that contains a &quot;private data&quot; segment after the terminator instead of the specified filler bytes &quot;ec 11&quot;. This private data segment must be deciphered with an encryption key. This can be used to store private information and to manage a company&#x27;s internal information.

=== Frame QR ===
Frame QR is a QR code with a &quot;canvas area&quot; that can be flexibly used. In the center of this code is the canvas area, where graphics, letters, and more can be flexibly arranged, making it possible to lay out the code without losing the design of illustrations, photos, etc.

=== HCC2D ===
Researchers have proposed a new High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) Code, which builds upon a QR code basis for preserving the QR robustness to distortions and uses colors for increasing data density (as of 2014 it is still in the prototyping phase). The HCC2D code specification is described in details in Querini &quot;et al.&quot; (2011), while techniques for color classification of HCC2D code cells are described in detail in Querini and Italiano (2014), which is an extended version of Querini and Italiano (2013).

Introducing colors into QR codes requires addressing additional issues. In particular, during QR code reading only the brightness information is taken into account, while HCC2D codes have to cope with chromatic distortions during the decoding phase. In order to ensure adaptation to chromatic distortions that arise in each scanned code, HCC2D codes make use of an additional field: the Color Palette Pattern. This is because color cells of a Color Palette Pattern are supposed to be distorted in the same way as color cells of the Encoding Region. Replicated color palettes are used for training machine-learning classifiers.

=== AQR ===
Accessible QR is a type of QR code that combines a standard QR code with a dot-dash pattern positioned around one corner of the code to provide product information for people who are blind and partially sighted. The codes, announce product categories and product details such as instructions, ingredients, safety warnings, and recycling information. The data is structured for the needs of users who are blind or partially sighted and offers larger text or audio output. It can read QR codes from a metre away, activating the smartphone&#x27;s accessibility features like VoiceOver to announce product details.

== License ==
The use of QR code technology is freely licensed as long as users follow the standards for QR code documented with JIS or ISO/IEC. Non-standardized codes may require special licensing.

Denso Wave owns a number of patents on QR code technology, but has chosen to exercise them in a limited fashion. In order to promote widespread usage of the technology Denso Wave chose to waive its rights to a key patent in its possession for &quot;standardized&quot; codes only. In the US, the granted QR code patent is 5726435, and in Japan 2938338, both of which have expired. The European Patent Office granted patent 0672994 to Denso Wave, which was then validated into French, UK, and German patents, all of which expired in March 2015.

The text &quot;QR Code&quot; itself is a registered trademark and wordmark of Denso Wave Incorporated. In UK, the trademark is registered as E921775, the term &quot;QR Code&quot;, with a filing date of 3 September 1998. The UK version of the trademark is based on the Kabushiki Kaisha Denso (DENSO CORPORATION) trademark, filed as Trademark 000921775, the term &quot;QR Code&quot;, on 3 September 1998 and registered on 16 December 1999 with the European Union OHIM (Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market).
The U.S. Trademark for the term &quot;QR Code&quot; is Trademark 2435991 and was filed on 29 September 1998 with an amended registration date of 13 March 2001, assigned to Denso Corporation. In South Korea, trademark application filed on 18 November 2011 was refused at 20 March 2012, because the Korean Intellectual Property Office viewed that the phrase was genericized among South Korean people to refer to matrix barcodes in general.

== Risks ==
The only context in which common QR codes can carry executable data is the URL data type. These URLs may host JavaScript code, which can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in applications on the host system, such as the reader, the web browser, or the image viewer, since a reader will typically send the data to the application associated with the data type used by the QR code.

In the case of no software exploits, malicious QR codes combined with a permissive reader can still put a computer&#x27;s contents and user&#x27;s privacy at risk. This practice is known as &quot;attagging&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;attack tagging&quot;. They are easily created and can be affixed over legitimate QR codes. On a smartphone, the reader&#x27;s permissions may allow use of the camera, full Internet access, read/write contact data, GPS, read browser history, read/write local storage, and global system changes.

Risks include linking to dangerous web sites with browser exploits, enabling the microphone/camera/GPS, and then streaming those feeds to a remote server, analysis of sensitive data (passwords, files, contacts, transactions), and sending email/SMS/IM messages or packets for DDoS as part of a botnet, corrupting privacy settings, stealing identity, and even containing malicious logic themselves such as JavaScript or a virus. These actions could occur in the background while the user is only seeing the reader opening a seemingly harmless web page. In Russia, a malicious QR code caused phones that scanned it to send premium texts at a fee of $6 each. QR codes have also been linked to scams in which stickers are placed on parking meters and other devices, posing as quick payment options, as seen in Austin, San Antonio and Boston, among other cities across the United States and Australia.

<text>Pat&#x27;s King of Steaks (also known as Pat&#x27;s Steaks) is a restaurant that specializes in cheesesteaks. It is located at the intersection of South 9th Street, Wharton Street and East Passyunk Avenue in the Passyunk Square section of South Philadelphia, directly across the street from rival Geno&#x27;s Steaks. 

It was founded in 1930 by Italian American brothers Pat and Harry Olivieri, who are credited with the invention of the cheesesteak.

==History==
Pat&#x27;s King of Steaks was founded by Pat (1907–1974) and Harry Olivieri (May 25, 1916 – July 22, 2006) in 1930 when they opened a hot dog stall at the corners of 9th Street, Wharton Street, and Passyunk Avenue. The brothers ran the stall while holding down other jobs; Harry worked as a carpenter, while Pat made sleds. 

In 1933, as the family relates the story, the brothers were working their stand when they decided to try something different for lunch. Pat Olivieri sent Harry Olivieri to the market for some inexpensive steak. The brothers thinly sliced the steak, then grilled it along with some chopped onions. The aroma attracted a cabdriver who was a regular customer; he asked to try the dish which the brothers called a steak sandwich, though the term originated from Louis&#x27; Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut, describing a similar sandwich. Pat sold him the sandwich for ten cents (). The steak sandwich would later evolve into the modern cheesesteak.

Soon afterwards, at the advice of the cabdriver, the brothers started selling steak sandwiches instead of hot dogs. By 1940, they had saved enough money to rent space to open a restaurant at the same spot where they had their stand. The two brothers worked at the restaurant for 15 to 18 hours a day for the next few decades while the restaurant was open 24 hours a day. Harry worked at the Philadelphia Navy Yard during World War II before returning to the restaurant.

In 1972, Harry Olivieri had a heart attack and retired from day-to-day management. He still visited the business for a few hours each day to meet and greet the customers.

After pulling back from expansion and franchising efforts in the 1980s, the business was divided up by the Olivieri family. Harry&#x27;s son, Frank, eventually bought out his father, sister and cousin and kept the original location, today run by Harry&#x27;s grandson, Frank Jr. Pat&#x27;s son Herbert opened disputed ownership of the business with Harry and his children and &quot;Olivieri&#x27;s Prince of Steaks&quot;, later to be the source of a family dispute (see below).

In the last few years of his life, Harry lived with his daughter in Brigantine, New Jersey. He died of heart failure on July 22, 2006, in Pomona, New Jersey, at the age of 90.

==Description==
A sign explains how to order; the customer asks for a variety of sandwich and then says &quot;wit&quot; or &quot;wit-out&quot; (i.e. &#x27;with&#x27; or &#x27;without&#x27; onions), a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Philadelphia accent. The varieties available are Cheez Whiz, provolone, or American cheese, as well as plain (no cheese).

==Olivieri family feud==
Pat&#x27;s King of Steaks is the original shop opened by Pasquale &quot;Pat&quot; Olivieri and his brother, Harry. Harry&#x27;s grandson, Frank, owns Pat&#x27;s. Pat&#x27;s grandson, Rick, owned Rick&#x27;s Original Philly Steaks at Reading Terminal Market, which closed in October 2008. He subsequently opened and closed Rick&#x27;s Steaks restaurants at other locations.

Pat&#x27;s son Herbert (Rick&#x27;s father) expanded the business by opening franchises of Pat&#x27;s King of Steaks. In the 1980s, the Olivieris split up the business. Harry and Frank Sr. kept the original location, and Herbert opened Olivieri&#x27;s Prince of Steaks in Reading Terminal Market. Herbert&#x27;s son Rick renamed it &quot;Rick&#x27;s&quot; in the mid-1990s, still using the crown logo and mentioning his grandfather, Pat Olivieri.

In October 2006, Pat&#x27;s sued Rick&#x27;s, alleging trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition, based on the use of the crown logo and the name &quot;Pat Olivieri&quot;.

The suit was settled in August 2007. Terms were not disclosed. Frank Olivieri Jr. said he was &quot;...happy with the settlement and I&#x27;m sure my cousin Rick is, as well.&quot; Rick Olivieri told reporters, &quot;It&#x27;s an agreement we can both live with. Everybody is happy.&quot;

Rick Olivieri died in 2022 of Frontotemporal Degeneration.

<text>Netspace was one of the major Internet service providers of Australia.
==History==
Netspace was founded in 1992 by Stuart Marburg and Richard Preen. The company initially offered dial-up internet access, as was the standard at the time. The company&#x27;s headquarters were located in Camberwell, a suburb in the city of Melbourne, in the state of Victoria, Australia.

Netspace was an earlier adopter of DSL in Australia and quickly focused primarily on offering ADSL-based Internet access. It initially offered Telstra ADSL and then installed its own DSLAMs in some regions, including Tasmania. The company offered services to retail, SoHo and business customers, including DNS, co-location, web hosting and VoIP, as well as core internet products. 

On 29 March 2010, an agreement was entered into which Netspace would be acquired by the larger ASX-listed ISP, iiNet, for AU$40 million. The company later retired Netspace as a brand. Netspace&#x27;s official website redirects to the webpage of iiNet, but Netspace email addresses continue to be supported.

<doc id="828562" wikidata="Q448612" url="?curid=828562" title="Diode-pumped solid-state laser">
<text>A diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) is a solid-state laser made by pumping a solid gain medium, for example, a ruby or a crystal, with a laser diode.

DPSSLs have advantages in compactness and efficiency over other types, and high power DPSSLs have replaced ion lasers and flashlamp-pumped lasers in many scientific applications, and are now appearing commonly in green and other color laser pointers.

== Coupling ==

The wavelength of laser diodes is tuned by means of temperature to produce an optimal compromise between the absorption coefficient in the crystal and energy efficiency (lowest possible pump photon energy). As waste energy is limited by the thermal lens this means higher power densities compared to high-intensity discharge lamps.

High power lasers use a single crystal, but many laser diodes are arranged in strips (multiple diodes next to each other in one substrate) or stacks (stacks of substrates). This diode grid can be imaged onto the crystal by means of a lens. Higher brightness (leading to better beam profile and longer diode lifetimes) is achieved by optically removing the dark areas between the diodes, which are needed for cooling and delivering the current. This is done in two steps:
# The &quot;fast axis&quot; is collimated with an aligned grating of cylindrical micro-lenses.
# The partially collimated beams are then imaged at reduced size into the crystal. The crystal can be pumped from both end faces or from three or more sides.
The beams from multiple diodes can also be combined by coupling each diode into an optical fiber, which is placed precisely over the diode (but behind the micro-lens). At the other end of the fiber bundle, the fibers are fused together to form a uniform, gap-less, round profile on the crystal. This also permits the use of a remote power supply.

=== Some numbers ===

High power laser diodes are fabricated as bars with multiple single strip laser diodes next to each other.

Each single strip diode typically has an active volume of:
and depending on the cooling technique for the whole bar (100 to 200) μm distance to the next laser diode.

The end face of the diode along the fast axis can be imaged onto strip of 1 μm height. But the end face along the slow axis can be imaged onto a smaller area than 100 μm. This is due to the small divergence (hence the name: &#x27;slow axis&#x27;) which is given by the ratio of depth to width. Using the above numbers the fast axis could be imaged onto a 5 μm wide spot.

So to get a beam which is equal divergence in both axis, the end faces of a bar composed of 5 laser diodes, can be imaged by means of 4 (acylindrical) cylinder lenses onto an image plane with 5 spots each with a size of 5 mm x 1 mm. This large size is needed for low divergence beams. Low divergence allows paraxial optics, which is cheaper, and which is used to not only generate a spot, but a long beam waist inside the laser crystal (length = 50 mm), which is to be pumped through its end faces.

Also in the paraxial case it is much easier to use gold or copper mirrors or glass prisms to stack the spots on top of each other, and get a 5 x 5 mm beam profile. A second pair of (spherical) lenses image this square beam profile inside the laser crystal.

A volume of 0.001 mm3 active volume in the laser diode is able to saturate 1250 mm3 in a Nd:YVO4 crystal.

== Common DPSSL processes ==

The most common DPSSL in use is the 532 nm wavelength green laser pointer. A powerful (&gt;200 mW) 808 nm wavelength infrared GaAlAs laser diode pumps a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) or a neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate (Nd:YVO4) crystal which produces 1064 nm wavelength light from the main spectral transition of neodymium ion. This light is then &quot;frequency doubled&quot; using a nonlinear optical process in a KTP crystal, producing 532 nm light. Green DPSSLs are usually around 20% efficient, although some lasers can reach up to 35% efficiency. In other words, a green DPSSL using a 2.5 W pump diode would be expected to output around 500-900 mW of 532 nm light.

In optimal conditions, Nd:YVO4 has a conversion efficiency of 60%, while KTP has a conversion efficiency of 80%. In other words, a green DPSSL can theoretically have an overall efficiency of 48%.

In the realm of very high output powers, the KTP crystal becomes susceptible to optical damage. Thus, high-power DPSSLs generally have a larger beam diameter, as the 1064 nm laser is expanded before it reaches the KTP crystal, reducing the irradiance from the infrared light. In order to maintain a lower beam diameter, a crystal with a higher damage threshold, such as lithium triborate (LBO), is used instead.

Blue DPSSLs use a nearly identical process, except that the 808 nm light is being converted by an Nd:YAG crystal to 946 nm light (selecting this non-principal spectral line of neodymium in the same Nd-doped crystals), which is then frequency-doubled to 473 nm by a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal or LBO crystal. Because of the lower gain for the materials, blue lasers are relatively weak, and are only around 3-5% efficient. In the late 2000s, it was discovered that bismuth triborate (BiBO) crystals were more efficient than BBO or LBO for second harmonic generation in mode-locked lasers and do not have the disadvantage of being hygroscopic, which degrades the crystal if it is exposed to moisture. In continuous-wave laser applications, however, BiBO may exhibit instabilities which degrade its performance.

Yellow DPSSLs use an even more complicated process: An 808 nm pump diode is used to generate 1,064 nm and 1,342 nm light, which are summed in parallel to become 593.5 nm. Due to their complexity, most yellow DPSSLs are only around 1% efficient, and usually more expensive per unit of power.

Another method is to generate 1,064 and 1,319 nm light, which are summed to 589 nm. This process is more efficient, with about 3% of the pump diode&#x27;s power being converted to yellow light.

== Comparison to diode lasers ==

DPSSLs and diode lasers are two of the most common types of solid-state lasers. However, both types have their advantages and disadvantages.

DPSSLs generally have a higher beam quality and can reach very high powers while maintaining a relatively good beam quality. Because the crystal pumped by the diode acts as its own laser, the quality of the output beam is independent of that of the input beam. In comparison, diode lasers can only reach a few hundred milliwatts unless they operate in multiple transverse mode. Such multi-mode lasers have a larger beam diameter and a greater divergence, which often makes them less desirable. In fact, single-mode operation is essential in some applications, such as optical drives.

On the other hand, diode lasers are cheaper and more energy efficient. As DPSSL crystals are not 100% efficient, some power is lost when the frequency is converted. DPSSLs are also more sensitive to temperature and can only operate optimally within a small range. Otherwise, the laser would suffer from stability issues, such as hopping between modes and large fluctuations in the output power. DPSSLs also require a more complex construction.

Diode lasers can also be precisely modulated with a greater frequency than DPSSLs.

Neodymium-doped solid state lasers continue to be the laser source of choice for industrial applications. Direct pumping of the upper Nd laser level at 885-nm (rather than at the more traditional broad 808-nm band) offers the potential of improved performance through a reduction in the lasing quantum defect, thereby improving system efficiency, reducing cooling requirements, and enabling further TEM00 power scaling. Because of the narrow 885-nm absorption feature in Nd:YAG, certain systems may benefit from the use of wavelength-locked diode pump sources, which serve to narrow and stabilize the pump emission spectrum to keep it closely aligned to this absorption feature. To date, high power diode laser locking schemes such as internal distributed feedback Bragg gratings and externally aligned volume holographic grating optics, VHG’s, have not been widely implemented due to the increased cost and assumed performance penalty of the technology. However, recent advancements in the manufacture of stabilized diode pump sources which utilize external wavelength locking now offer improved spectral properties with little-to-no impact on power and efficiency. Benefits of this approach include improvements in laser efficiency, spectral linewidth, and pumping efficiency.

<doc id="828585" wikidata="Q612863" url="?curid=828585" title="Out of the Inkwell">
<text>Out of the Inkwell is an American animated film series of the silent era. It was produced by Max Fleischer from 1918 to 1929 and was called &quot;The Inkwell Imps&quot; at the end of that period.

==History==
The series was the result of three short experimental films that Max Fleischer independently produced from 1914 to 1916 to demonstrate his invention, the rotoscope, a device consisting of a film projector and easel used to achieve realistic movement for animated cartoons. The rotoscope projected motion picture film through an opening in the easel, covered by a glass pane serving as a drawing surface. The image on the projected film was traced onto paper, advancing the film one frame at a time as each drawing was made. Fleischer&#x27;s younger brother Dave Fleischer, who was working as a clown at Coney Island, served as the model for their first famous character, eventually known as Koko the Clown.

&quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; began at the Bray Studio as a monthly entry in &quot;The Bray Pictograph Screen Magazine&quot; produced for Paramount from 1918, and later for Goldwyn Pictures from 1919 to 1921. In that same year, The Fleischer brothers started their own studio, and in 1923, the clown who previously had no name came to be known as Koko when animation veteran Dick Huemer became the new director of animation.

Huemer, who began his animation career with the &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; cartoons in 1916, brought the influence of the short and tall companions to &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; with the creation of a small canine companion named Fitz, who later evolved into Bimbo in the sound era. Huemer redesigned the clown for animation, which reduced Fleischer&#x27;s dependency on the Rotoscope for fluid animation. He also defined the drawing style with his distinctive inking quality that the series was famous for, but it was the interaction of the live-action sequences with the artist/creator, Max Fleischer, and his pen and ink creations that were the foundation of the series. Typically, the cartoons start with live-action showing Max drawing the characters on paper, or opening the inkwell to release the characters into &quot;reality&quot;.

The &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; series ran from 1919 to mid 1927, and was renamed &quot;The Inkwell Imps&quot; for Paramount, continuing until 1929. In all, 77 &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; and 57 &quot;Inkwell Imps&quot; films were produced in eleven years. &quot;The Inkwell Imps&quot; series was replaced by the &quot;Talkartoons&quot; in 1929, and Koko was retired until 1931, appearing as a supporting character with Bimbo and Betty Boop. Koko&#x27;s last theatrical appearance was in the Betty Boop cartoon &quot;Ha-Ha-Ha&quot; (1934), a remake of the silent &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; film &quot;The Cure&quot; (1924). Koko had a brief cameo in his only color theatrical appearance in the &quot;Screen Song&quot; entry &quot;Toys will be Toys&quot; (1949).

In 1950, Stuart Productions released a number of the Inkwell Studios &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; cartoons, and a selection of the Paramount &quot;Inkwell Imps&quot; cartoons to television. In 1955, the &quot;Inkwell Imps&quot;, along with 2,500 pre-October 1950 Paramount shorts and cartoons were sold to television packagers, the majority acquired by U.M. &amp; M. TV Corporation.

In 1958, Max Fleischer revived his studio in a partnership with Hal Seeger, and in 1960 produced a series of one hundred &quot;Out Of The Inkwell&quot; five-minute cartoons. In the new color series, Koko had a clown girlfriend named Kokette, a pal named Kokonut, and a villain named Mean Moe. Larry Storch provided the voice for Koko and all of the supporting characters.

Many of the shorts in the original series are now in the public domain. One short in the series, 1922&#x27;s &quot;The Hypnotist&quot;, was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2010. In 2024, the short &quot;Ko-Ko&#x27;s Earth Control&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Savior is a 1998 American war film starring Dennis Quaid, Stellan Skarsgård, Nastassja Kinski, and Nataša Ninković. It is about a U.S. mercenary escorting a Bosnian Serb woman and her newborn child to a United Nations safe zone during the Bosnian War. It was produced by Oliver Stone.

==Plot==
Joshua Rose (Dennis Quaid), a U.S. Department of State official on embassy duty in Paris, sees his wife (Nastassja Kinski) and son killed in a bombing by Islamic terrorists. Immediately after the transfer ceremony he storms into a nearby mosque and shoots several worshipers. His friend Peter (Stellan Skarsgård) is forced to shoot one of the survivors when the man tries to kill Rose, and in order to avoid arrest they join the French Foreign Legion, with Joshua taking the name Guy.

Years later, Joshua, now going by the name of &quot;Guy&quot;, and Peter are fighting for the Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnian War. They are stationed on a bridge separating them and the Bosniaks in a town. Guy mans a sniper post overlooking the bridge, and witnesses Peter&#x27;s death when Peter drops his guard at a checkpoint and a young girl throws a grenade at him. Guy in turn shoots a boy crossing the bridge in pursuit of his runaway goat.

Guy is then seen searching the Bosniak side of the town following a ceasefire along with a Bosnian Serb soldier Goran (Sergej Trifunović). In one house they find an elderly Muslim woman who is confined to bed and shell-shocked and a dead woman. Guy also finds a sleeping baby who has been hidden in a wardrobe but does not inform Goran who hacks a finger off an old Bosniak woman in order to steal her ring.

After they leave the house, helicopters attack the town. As Goran takes cover Guy stays out in the open and returns to the house, but finds that both the child and the old lady have been killed by falling rubble. Later, Guy and Goran prepare for a prisoner exchange with the Bosnian forces. When they arrive at the exchange point one of the young Serb female prisoners being exchanged, Vera (Nataša Ninković), is visibly pregnant because she was raped by Muslims. Guy and Goran take her in Goran&#x27;s car and they head towards her village.

In the car Goran berates Vera for being impregnated by a Bosniak even though Guy points out that she was almost certainly raped. Goran eventually stops the car in a tunnel. He throws Vera out of the car and begins to kick her as she lies on the ground. The blows force Vera into premature labor. As Goran prepares to murder the soon-to-be-born child, Guy kills Goran and then helps deliver the baby. When he shows Vera the child, a girl, she rejects it and attempts to shoot herself before Guy manages to stop her.

They arrive at her house where she is rejected by her family due to the shame felt by her father. They leave her house with Guy intending to head for a refugee camp where Vera and the baby would be looked after. Vera continues to reject the child and does not talk to Guy. After being told by Goran&#x27;s family that his corpse has been found and that he was last seen in the company of Guy and Vera, Vera&#x27;s father and brother head off in pursuit of them. They eventually catch up with them when they stop to get milk for the child. Guy is shot and injured, but Vera places herself between him and her father as he goes to kill him, and her father backs off and allows them to leave when Guy tells him that Goran intended to kill both Vera and the baby.

They briefly return to Vera&#x27;s village to find it has been attacked, and have to watch from a distance as her family and other villagers are rounded up and led away by Bosniak militiamen. Guy decides to head for the safety of the UN zone in Split on the Dalmatian Coast. On their way they stop and take refuge with an elderly Croat man and his Bosnian Serb wife. The old man tells Guy &quot;before the war, no difference [between Serbs and Croats], and now, stupid&quot;, pointing to his head to show madness.

After moving on they reach what they think is a relatively safe area. Vera leaves Guy and the child to rest in an abandoned and half-sunk boat on the edge of a lake while she goes to find a bus that will take them to Split. Vera is captured along with other civilians by members of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO). The HVO takes their prisoners to the waterfront where Guy is hiding in the boat. The HVO then proceed to beat several to death with a sledgehammer, including Vera, as they stand in the water. The fighters shoot those that are left as Guy witnesses the slaughter from inside the boat but can do nothing without giving himself and the child away. He smothers the baby in order to keep her quiet as the HVO prepares to leave. She stops breathing but is soon resuscitated by Guy.

Guy eventually makes his way onto a bus that takes him and the baby to Split where he leaves Vera&#x27;s baby in an unattended Red Cross vehicle and writes the name &quot;Vera&quot; on a paper before walking to a pier, throwing his rifle and scope in the water and collapsing on a bench. A woman who was on the bus with him approaches him, carrying the girl and offering help. When she asks if the baby is his, Guy replies that she is and the woman promises to take them both to a hospital.

<doc id="828614" wikidata="Q2347334" url="?curid=828614" title="CPL (programming language)">
<text>CPL (Combined Programming Language) is a multi-paradigm programming language developed in the early 1960s. It is an early ancestor of the C language via the BCPL and B languages.

==Design==
CPL was developed initially at the Mathematical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge as the &quot;Cambridge Programming Language&quot; and later published jointly between Cambridge and the University of London Computer Unit as the &quot;Combined Programming Language&quot; (CPL was also nicknamed by some as &quot;Cambridge Plus London&quot; or &quot;Christopher&#x27;s Programming Language&quot;). Christopher Strachey, David Barron and others were involved in its development. The first paper describing it was published in 1963, while it was being implemented on the Titan Computer at Cambridge and the Atlas Computer at London.

It was heavily influenced by ALGOL 60, but instead of being extremely small, elegant and simple, CPL was intended for a wider application area than scientific calculations and was therefore much more complex and not as elegant as ALGOL 60. CPL was a big language for its time. CPL attempted to go beyond ALGOL to include industrial process control, business data processing and possibly some early command line games. CPL was intended to allow low-level programming and high level abstractions using the same language.

However, CPL was only implemented very slowly. The first CPL compiler was probably written about 1970, but the language never gained much popularity and seems to have disappeared without trace sometime in the 1970s.

BCPL (for &quot;Basic CPL&quot;, although originally &quot;Bootstrap CPL&quot;) was a much simpler language based on CPL intended primarily as a systems programming language, particularly for writing compilers; it was first implemented in 1967, prior to CPL&#x27;s first implementation. BCPL then led, via B, to the popular and influential C programming language.

==Example==
The function MAX as formulated by Peter Norvig:

The closing section block symbol used here () is an approximation of the original symbol, in which the cross stroke is vertical. This is available in Unicode as but does not display correctly on many systems.

== Implementations ==
It is thought that CPL was never fully implemented in the 1960s, existing as a theoretical construct with some research work on partial implementations.

Peter Norvig has written (for Yapps, a Python compiler-compiler) a simple CPL to Python translator for modern machines.

<doc id="828626" wikidata="Q15995209" url="?curid=828626" title="Internode (ISP)">
<text>Internode Pty Ltd was an Australian Internet service provider (ISP) that provided NBN broadband services, business-class broadband access, web hosting, co-location, Voice over IP, and a variety of related services. It was based in Adelaide, South Australia. Internode became part of TPG Telecom in July 2020. TPG initiated a closure of Internode business operations in December 2023, and began transitioning existing Internode customers to other TPG-owned brands (iiNet and Vodafone).

==History==
The company was founded in 1991 by Robyn Taylor and Managing Director Simon Hackett,

Internode was the first ISP to offer ADSL2/2+ services in Australia, by installing their own DSLAMs in Telstra exchanges. This allowed them to offer access speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s, significantly higher than the fastest speed then offered by Telstra at the time (1.5 Mbit/s).
(See also Broadband Internet Access, Australia) Internode also provided a Naked ADSL2+ service, operating on both Agile and Optus hardware. Internode was a part of the Terria consortium which bid to build the National Broadband Network.

===Acquisition by iiNet===
On 22 December 2011, Western Australian based internet service provider iiNet announced the acquisition of Internode in a deal worth $105 million. 

In May 2012, it was announced that Simon Hackett&#x27;s role would change from being the managing director of Internode to become a non-executive board member for iiNet. At the same time several members of Internode&#x27;s management team were transferred to management positions within iiNet.

In November 2013, it was announced that Simon Hackett would be leaving Internode and the iiNet Group to join the board of the NBN Co which has been tasked by the Australian Government to provide the next generation of broadband to Australia.

In September 2015, iiNet was acquired by TPG Telecom in a $1.65 billion deal.

In December 2023, Internode announced that it would cease accepting new customers to the Internode brand, and that all existing residential Internode customers will be migrated to the iiNet brand.

===Milestones===
*Telecommunications backbone in regional Australia: 2001 marked the launch of the Coorong Communications Network, one of the first non-incumbent telecommunications backbones built into a regional area in Australia, offering low cost voice and data services to regional customers. In 2005 a second regional network based on the same technology was deployed in the Yorke Peninsula region, demonstrating that the underlying model is not only sustainable, but reproducible. (see Press Release)
*Games network: 1 July 2002 saw the launch of the Internode Games Network, a private gaming network run by Internode for its ADSL customers. It became the largest gaming network in Australia (in terms of peak daily player count) ahead of even Telstra&#x27;s GameArena. It has since been discontinued.
*Agile Broadband rollout: In mid-2003, Internode&#x27;s infrastructure company, Agile, installed its own equipment in the Telstra exchange at Meningie, South Australia. This made it the first exchange in Regional Australia where ADSL was available from a non-Telstra DSLAM. DSLAM deployment continued, ultimately becoming national in extent.
*International Backbone: In early 2005, Agile extended the national private backbone it operates for Internode to connect to the United States. This link was initially provided by leased capacity on the Southern Cross Cable system, expanded in December 2006 to also utilise capacity leased on Australia-Japan Cable to provide an alternative pathway to that provided by Southern Cross Cable.
*Unmetered content: Internode also runs content servers such as a cluster of Steam content servers. Further &#x27;unmetered&#x27; content available via the national Agile backbone network includes relays of popular streaming audio sources and a 10 terabyte mirror server. includes a file mirror and radio streams
*Gaming Network: Internode offers free services to members, recently giving a free advance screening of the blockbuster V for Vendetta in Brisbane, and Lucky Number Slevin in Melbourne. These screenings will be discontinued in favour of supporting events, such as the Canberra Games Festival.
*SourceForge Mirror: On 3 June 2008, Internode announced the availability of the first full Australian SourceForge mirror.
*IPv6: On 18 July 2008, Internode launched a national IPv6 service, the first in Australia.
*Email Services: On 30 November 2023 Internode will stop providing an email service. Internode email addresses are moving to The Messaging Company in 2023 and will be at a yet to be determined cost to the end user.

Internode has supported many local events, such as the Adelaide Film Festival, WOMADelaide, the Adelaide Fringe (for at least 10 years until 2014) and the Global Green hosting Challenge.

It also provides services for video game company Valve.

==Products==

===VoIP===
Internode operates a nationally available VoIP based service called NodePhone which leverages the international Agile backbone network and widespread deployment of Cisco VoIP gateways on that backbone to offer low cost, distance independent telephony services. This telephony service runs over a national private IP network, not over the &quot;best-effort&quot; Internet like many VoIP competitors. As such, it is positioned as a carrier grade, packet based voice service, and is not susceptible to quality problems created by external Internet path failures or congestion. While the original NodePhone did not allow incoming PSTN calls, NodePhone2, released on 23 April 2007, is a full two-way VoIP service.

===Wireless hotspots===
Internode provides a contiguous wireless hotspot network, formerly known as CityLAN, in Adelaide, South Australia. The network is an initiative brought about to provide Internet access throughout Adelaide, and eventually nationally. This high-speed Wi-Fi network is open to the public with coverage at hotspots throughout the Adelaide CBD.

The &quot;CityLAN&quot; network is an existing wireless network in the Adelaide city provided by Internode. It provides wireless access to guests and existing Internode customers and has strong access around North Terrace, Rundle Street, Rundle Mall, Grenfell Street, Hutt Street, and areas of North Adelaide. Access through the Internode Wireless Hotspot network is also provided throughout both the Adelaide Airport and Darwin International Airport terminals. Guests may only use a limited number of services, while Internode customers that log into the service get all ports opened, allowing, for instance, the use of email clients like Thunderbird or Outlook.

<text>Poniatowa is a town in southeastern Poland, in Opole Lubelskie County, in Lublin Voivodship, with 10,500 inhabitants (2006). It belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland.

==History==
Exact date of establishment of Poniatowa is not known, however, it must have existed before the year 1382, because on September 2, 1382, the Starosta of Lublin issued a document co-signed by a man named Gotard, who was the owner of a village named Poniatowa. After King Casimir III the Great annexed Red Ruthenia into Poland (1340s), the region became populated with settlers from other parts of Lesser Poland. In the 15th century, some 178 new villages were founded in the Land of Lublin. They were owned by the &quot;szlachta&quot; noble families, who were supposed to answer royal call in case of an armed conflict (see Pospolite ruszenie). By the early 16th century, Poniatowa was under the authority of a Castellan from nearby Wąwolnica. It was administratively located in the Lublin Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province.

In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Poniatowa remained a village, which was part of Lublin Voivodeship. It belonged to the aristocratic Poniatowski family, which gave Poland its last king – Stanisław August Poniatowski. The family gave its name to the settlement, although by the time Poniatowskis got to prominence its members were living elsewhere. The village was in private hands until the mid-19th century, when, after the Partitions of Poland, it became part of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. The Bull (&quot;Ciołek&quot; in Polish) which appears on the town&#x27;s coat of arms is borrowed from one of the Poniatowskis heraldic designs.

===20th century===
According to the 1921 census, the population of Poniatowa was exclusively Polish by nationality and Roman Catholic by confession.

The present town of Poniatowa was founded in the late 1930s, to house arriving workers of the new telecommunications equipment factory PZT (&quot;Zaklady Tele i Radiotechniczne - Filia nr 2&quot;), construction of which began in 1937. The factory was part of the Central Industrial Region, and was to supply radio equipment to the Polish Army. First buildings of the &quot;new town&quot; were put up in 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II and the German conquest of Poland. During the German occupation, the already erected factory was used by the Nazis to support the war effort using slave labor.

===Holocaust history of PZT and Többens===
In the latter half of 1941 (following Operation Barbarossa), the Germans established the first camp for the Soviet POWs on the factory grounds. By mid-1942, about 20,000 Soviet prisoners had perished there. In April 1943, during the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto, about 15,000 Polish Jews – mostly tailors and seamstresses – were brought to the camp where, for the next six months, they worked as forced labour in war-supply workshops owned by German war profiteer Walter Caspar Többens from Hamburg. The Poniatowa camp facilities included kitchen, medical room, a kindergarten where the children were kept while the adults and adolescents were making garments for the Wehrmacht. The entire workforce of the camp including 3,000 Slovakian and Austrian Jews (the camp elite), were executed during the Operation Harvest Festival (&quot;Aktion Erntefest&quot;) of November 4, 1943, into fake anti-aircraft trenches.

The monument in memory of the victims of the Holocaust was unveiled in Poniatowa on November 4, 2008 in the presence of the ambassador of Israel to Poland David Peleg, the ambassador of Austria, minister from the German embassy, minister from the Czech embassy, voivode of Lublin; the town&#x27;s mayor, and many other officials, including Warsaw rabbi and priests.
Germans left Poniatowa in July 1944 ahead of the Soviet offensive. After the war, in 1949, the industrial development of Poniatowa resumed, with a reconstituted factory reestablished in the town. As a result of the period of intensive growth after 1952, the town received its city charter on July 18, 1962. In its heyday, during the Communist regime, the factory employed some 5,000 workers, about half of the town&#x27;s population. It produced components for refrigerators and other household appliances. After the collapse of the Soviet empire and the subsequent free market reforms of 1989 the factory experienced economic difficulties, and in 1998 entered into bankruptcy. Presently, attempts are being made to attract new investors to take advantage of the factory&#x27;s excellent infrastructure.

==Sports==
The town has a sports club &quot;Stal&quot;, established in 1951.

<text>Linfield Football Club is a Northern Irish professional football club, based in south Belfast, which plays in the NIFL Premiership – the highest level of the Northern Ireland Football League. The fourth-oldest club on the island of Ireland, Linfield was founded in 1886 by workers at the Ulster Spinning Company&#x27;s Linfield Mill. Since 1905, the club&#x27;s home ground has been Windsor Park, which is also the home of the Northern Ireland national team and is the largest football stadium in Northern Ireland. They train at Midgley Park which is beside the stadium. The club&#x27;s badge displays Windsor Castle, in reference to the ground&#x27;s namesake.

Historically, Linfield shared a fierce rivalry with Belfast Celtic until Celtic&#x27;s withdrawal from the league for political reasons in 1949. Since that time the club&#x27;s main rival has been Glentoran, with the duo known locally as the &quot;Big Two&quot;. This rivalry traditionally includes a league derby played on Boxing Day each year, which usually attracts Northern Ireland&#x27;s highest domestic attendance of the season, excluding cup finals. For the 2021–22 season, Linfield&#x27;s average league home attendance was approximately 2,900, the highest in the division and more than double the league&#x27;s overall average of around 1,400. The team, nicknamed &quot;The Blues&quot;, is managed by former Northern Ireland international and the country&#x27;s all-time record goalscorer, David Healy. Healy was appointed on 14 October 2015 to succeed Warren Feeney, following Feeney&#x27;s resignation.

Domestically, Linfield has been one of the most successful clubs in the world, holding several national and global records. The club has won 56 league titles, which is more than twice than any other Northern Irish club, and makes Linfield the world&#x27;s most successful club in terms of national championships won. The club has lifted the Irish Cup 44 times, the second-highest number of national cup wins worldwide. It has also won the League Cup a record twelve times, as well as four all-Ireland cup competitions, among other domestic cups, taking its trophy count to well over 116, one of the most in the world. In the 1921–22 season, Linfield completed an unprecedented clean sweep of all seven available trophies (Septuple) – to date, this is the only recorded instance of a seven-trophy season being achieved in world football. In the modern era, the club won all four available domestic trophies in 2006 to complete a domestic quadruple, and has also won three domestic trebles. The club also holds the world record for the most domestic doubles, with 25. Linfield is one of only three clubs to have completed an Irish League campaign unbeaten, having done so on four occasions.

The club was one of the eight founding members of the Irish League in 1890, won the inaugural league title, and is one of only three clubs to have gone on to compete in every season of the Irish League&#x27;s top division since; a joint world record for the longest continuous membership of a national league&#x27;s top division. In European football, the club&#x27;s best finish is the quarter-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup.

==Club history==

===Formation and early years (1886–1918)===
The club was founded in March 1886 in an area of south Belfast known as Sandy Row by workers at the Ulster Spinning Company&#x27;s Linfield Mill. Originally known as Linfield Athletic Club, the team initially played on an area of land located at the back of the mill owned by the company, which was known as the Meadow. Originally, the club had intended to have a rule in place to limit membership to employees of the mill only. However, this idea was quickly scrapped to allow for the strongest team possible, with six of the club&#x27;s first eleven players being non-employees. Linfield was credited with originating the passing game in Ireland, where a dribbling based approach had been the norm until around 1890, and for three seasons during the club&#x27;s early years they competed in the English FA Cup. In the 1888–89 qualifying rounds they defeated Ulster and Bolton Wanderers to reach the fourth qualifying round, where they faced Cliftonville. After two draws, they won 7–0 in the second replay, which was played on 25 December 1888. This is notable for being the only FA Cup match ever to be played on Christmas Day.

This victory meant they qualified for the first round proper for the first and only time, where they were drawn to face Nottingham Forest in what would turn out to be a controversial tie. Linfield had earned an impressive 2–2 draw in Nottingham, which meant a replay back in Belfast. In an apparent cup upset, Linfield then defeated Forest 3–1 at the Ulster Cricket Ground in Ballynafeigh, with the large crowd celebrating the fact that Linfield had progressed to the second round. However, a few days later the Belfast Telegraph revealed that the &#x27;replay&#x27; had actually been played as nothing more than a friendly. Prior to the match, Linfield had conceded the tie after discovering that they had inadvertently fielded an ineligible player, William Johnston, in the first match. Officials from both clubs had agreed not to reveal this information to the players or the public before the match, in order to play the match as planned. In any case, Linfield would have been unlikely to have played any further part in the cup, as the costs of travelling to Kent to play the second round tie against Chatham at an open ground with no gate income would have been prohibitive. Linfield made their final FA Cup appearance during the 1890–91 first qualifying round, being defeated 5–4 by Nantwich. This was the last season in which Irish clubs entered the competition.

Success on the field meant that the club had to accommodate bigger crowds, bringing about a move to Ulsterville Avenue in 1889. In 1890, Bob Milne signed for the club from the Gordon Highlanders. The Scot would soon become a key member of the team, helping the Blues to lift the Irish Cup at the young age of 20. The club stayed at Ulsterville for five years before housing development on the ground in 1894 meant that the club had to move on once again. Between 1894 and 1897, Linfield played all of their home games at opponents&#x27; grounds until the president of the club, Robert Gibson, along with other club members, eventually secured a ground lease at Myrtlefield in the Balmoral area of the city. However, this was another temporary home. The club stayed here until 1905, when they moved into Windsor Park. The club&#x27;s first silverware at Windsor arrived in the 1906–07 season, with the club lifting both the league title and the County Antrim Shield. This would be the first of a trio of league titles, with the 1907–08 and 1908–09 league titles to follow.

In 1910, team captain Bob Milne left the club with a legacy as one of Linfield&#x27;s best ever players. He had amassed nine Irish Cups, eight league titles, and had earned 27 international caps for the Ireland national team during his time at the club. Another Scottish player, Marshall McEwan, joined the club in 1911 at the age of 26. He had previously played for English clubs Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers and Chelsea. McEwan is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 1913 Irish Cup final, described by some fans as the best in years. McEwan retired in 1916, but remained in Belfast and later opened several businesses in the city. In 1915, the Irish League was suspended as a result of the First World War. In its place, a temporary unofficial league known as the &quot;Belfast &amp; District League&quot; was set up and ran for four seasons until the return of the Irish League in 1919. As this was an unofficial competition, any titles during this time are not counted as Irish League Championships. Linfield won this competition twice, in 1915–16 along with the Irish Cup, and in 1917–18.

===Two seven-trophy seasons (1921–22 &amp; 1961–62)===
In the 1921–22 season, the club achieved a clean sweep of all the domestic competitions they entered – the Irish League, Irish Cup, County Antrim Shield, Alhambra Cup, Belfast Charity Cup, Gold Cup and the City Cup. The club followed this up the next season by winning a treble including the Irish League, Irish Cup and County Antrim Shield in 1922–23. In 1927, Joe Bambrick signed for the Blues, and would become one of the club&#x27;s all-time top goal scorers. In the 1929–30 season, Bambrick scored a remarkable 94 goals – a record that surprisingly stood for only one season, until Glentoran&#x27;s Fred Roberts scored an incredible 96 goals during the following campaign. In 1930, Bambrick scored six goals in one game for Ireland – a 7–0 win over Wales. The 1931–32, 1933–34 and 1934–35 league titles followed for Linfield, before Bambrick left the club to join Chelsea in 1935 having scored 286 league goals in just 183 games for Linfield – a remarkable ratio of 1.56 goals per game. The Irish League was once again suspended in 1940 as a result of the Second World War, with another temporary unofficial league set up which was called the &quot;Northern Regional League&quot;. Linfield won this league three times – in 1942–43, 1944–45 and 1945–46. This league ran for seven seasons until the return of the Irish League once again in 1947.

In 1957, Jackie Milburn famously signed for the Blues as player-manager from Newcastle United, and won the Ulster Footballer of the Year award for his performances during his first season at the club. Milburn&#x27;s presence dramatically increased average crowds at matches, with the Belfast Telegraph calling it the &quot;signing of the century&quot;. Milburn is famous for scoring Linfield&#x27;s first ever goals in European competition. In September 1959, he scored both goals against IFK Göteborg in a 2–1 Linfield win at Windsor Park in the first leg of the 1959–60 European Cup preliminary round tie – the club&#x27;s European debut. Milburn was also the Irish league&#x27;s top goal scorer on two occasions before leaving the club in 1960 to join Yiewsley. In 1962, forty years after Linfield&#x27;s remarkable seven-trophy season, the club repeated the feat in the 1961–62 season under manager Isaac McDowell. They won another seven-trophy haul including the Irish League, Irish Cup, County Antrim Shield, Gold Cup, City Cup and the Ulster Cup. They also won the North-South Cup final that season, but it was actually the conclusion of the 1960–61 competition. Fixture congestion had meant that the final could not be played before the end of the previous season, so it was rescheduled to take place during the 1961–62 season. A commemorative event was held in April 2012, celebrating the 90th and 50th anniversaries of the 1921–22 and 1961–62 seven-trophy-winning teams.

===Roy Coyle&#x27;s 31-trophy haul (1975–1990)===
Following a spell in England playing for Sheffield Wednesday and Grimsby Town, Roy Coyle joined the club as player-manager, taking over the reins from outgoing manager Billy Campbell. After a tough start to his managerial career at the club, Coyle went on to become the most successful Linfield manager in history, winning numerous trophies during his time at Windsor Park. His first season in charge was without silverware. In fact, having been Irish Cup runners-up the previous season when Coleraine defeated the Blues 1–0 after two replays, Linfield suffered one of the biggest upsets in Northern Irish football history when B Division club Carrick Rangers defeated the Blues 2–1 in the 1975–76 Irish Cup final on 10 April 1976. This giant-killing act in which a junior club defeated a senior club in the Irish Cup final had only happened twice before in the cup&#x27;s history, and not since 1955. The club stuck by Coyle however, and it was not long before he brought silverware to the club. His first honour arrived in the 1976–77 season in the form of the County Antrim Shield. However, the Blues suffered defeat in the Irish Cup final for the third consecutive season when they lost 4–1 against Coleraine. The 1977–78 season saw the club win an Irish League, Irish Cup and Ulster Cup treble. Runners-up in the last three Irish Cup finals, this time they were not to be denied. A 3–1 victory over Ballymena United secured the club&#x27;s third trophy of the season.

Coyle retired from playing duties in 1980, but continued as manager. In 1982, future manager David Jeffrey joined the club following a stint in the Manchester United youth team and played for Coyle under many of his trophy successes, captaining the side for much of that time. One of Coyle&#x27;s biggest achievements as manager was leading the club to six consecutive league titles between 1981–82 and 1986–87, equalling the record for the most consecutive titles which was set by Belfast Celtic in 1947–48. 1986 was the year that Noel Bailie began what would turn out to be a 25-year career at the club. Although a defender for most of that time, Bailie began as a left midfielder.

Coyle&#x27;s final trophy as Linfield manager was the Gold Cup in 1989–90. During his 15 years at the club he had amassed 10 League titles, 3 Irish Cups, 7 Gold Cups, 4 Ulster Cups, 5 County Antrim Shields, the Irish League Cup, and the Tyler Cup – 31 major honours in total. Coyle left the club in April 1990. Eric Bowyer was appointed as Coyle&#x27;s replacement, but it was a relatively unsuccessful reign that only lasted for two years until he was sacked in 1992, with David Jeffrey also leaving the club that year to join Ards. Next into the managerial hot seat was Trevor Anderson, who brought more silverware to the club during his five years in charge between 1992 and 1997, including 2 Irish League titles and 2 Irish Cups. After retiring as a player in 1996 following a one-year spell at Larne, David Jeffrey returned to the club as Anderson&#x27;s assistant manager. This partnership lasted until Anderson resigned on the morning of 4 January 1997. Anderson later became Director of Football at Newry Town.

===The David Jeffrey years (1997–2014)===
Jeffrey took charge of the team in a caretaker capacity for a league match against Portadown that afternoon, and remained as caretaker manager for the following match against Ballyclare Comrades in the Floodlit Cup on 7 January. He was officially appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 8 January 1997. In his first full season in charge he led the club to three trophies – the League Cup, County Antrim Shield, and Floodlit Cup – and narrowly missed out on the league title to champions Cliftonville by four points. Jeffrey won his first league title as manager in the 1999–2000 season however, along with a third consecutive League Cup triumph. The Blues retained the league title the following season, and also won the Charity Shield and the County Antrim Shield. The 2001–02 season saw the club win a cup double, lifting both the Irish Cup and the League Cup. In 2005, the inauguration of the Setanta Cup meant the return of an all-Ireland cup competition for the first time since 1980. The Blues qualified as league champions, but started the competition poorly – losing 2–1 away to Longford Town. They recovered from that opening defeat to eventually reach the final against Shelbourne, with the Blues being major underdogs going into the match against full-time professional League of Ireland opposition. However, they overcame the odds with a 2–0 victory to become inaugural winners of the competition. Incidentally, Linfield were in fact the reigning all-Ireland champions at the time, having won the final staging of the Tyler Cup in 1980 before the competition was discontinued.

The 2005–06 season was the most successful of Jeffrey&#x27;s tenure, with the Blues achieving a clean sweep of all four domestic competitions; the Irish Premier League, Irish Cup, Irish League Cup, and County Antrim Shield. However, they failed to retain the Setanta Cup as defending champions when they were narrowly beaten 1–0 at Windsor Park in the semi-finals by eventual winners, Drogheda United. In April 2010, former captain Noel Bailie made his 1,000th appearance for the club when he played in a 0–0 draw against Crusaders in the league. A few days later, Linfield won their 49th league title after a 1–0 home win against Cliftonville. The following year, a landmark 50th league title arrived during the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary year. Bailie retired from football in April 2011 at the age of 40, after making 1,013 appearances for the club in all competitions since making his debut against Ballymena United in March 1989. Linfield subsequently retired the number 11 shirt in his honour. In the 2011–12 season, Linfield won a league and cup double for the third consecutive season and the sixth time in seven seasons – a record 51st league title, 42nd Irish Cup win, and 23rd double overall.

The 2012–13 season was undoubtedly a low ebb for the club under Jeffrey&#x27;s reign. The Blues were off the pace for most of the league campaign – their season encapsulated in a 3–1 home defeat by newly promoted Ballinamallard United in October 2012. Cliftonville were the eventual champions, securing their fourth league title after defeating Linfield 3–2 at Solitude on 13 April 2013. Crusaders secured the runners-up place, leaving the Blues in third place – a distant 29 points behind the champions. The club went out of the 2013 Setanta Sports Cup after a heavy aggregate defeat in the quarter-finals, went out of the League Cup at the semi-final stage, and exited the Irish Cup in the fifth round after a replay. The club&#x27;s first Irish Cup defeat in four years was also the first time in 16 years they had lost their opening tie of the competition.

When the 2014 Setanta Sports Cup was confirmed in December 2013, the club opted not to enter the competition, citing inconvenient fixture scheduling, reduced prize money, and the difficulties faced for Linfield supporters to attend away games as the reasons behind their withdrawal. At the time, the club did not rule out future participation, however, they would never enter the competition again. League champions Cliftonville also withdrew from the competition for similar reasons, with the next two highest placed sides from the previous season&#x27;s league table (Ballinamallard United and Coleraine) being drafted in as replacements. In February 2014, Jeffrey announced that he would be stepping down at the end of the 2013–14 season, bringing an end to his trophy-laden reign after 17 years. In March 2014, the Blues lifted the County Antrim Shield for a record 43rd time by defeating Crusaders 4–1 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time in the final. This was a significant milestone for Jeffrey – his 31st and last trophy as Linfield manager, equalling Roy Coyle&#x27;s record. Jeffrey still had the opportunity to win a record-breaking 32nd trophy as manager in the form of the 2013–14 league title. However, despite topping the league table for much of the season, the Blues had to settle for the runners-up spot, six points behind champions Cliftonville. Jeffrey&#x27;s reign came to a winning end with a 5–2 victory over Glenavon on the final day of the 2013–14 league season.

===Feeney &amp; Healy (2014–present)===
Former Northern Ireland international Warren Feeney succeeded Jeffrey as Linfield manager. Feeney had been player-assistant manager at English Conference Premier side Salisbury City at the time of his appointment. His cousin, Lee Feeney, played for Linfield in two spells between 1997–1999 and 2002–2003. Former Blackburn Rovers player, Andy Todd, was appointed as Feeney&#x27;s assistant. Feeney&#x27;s only full season in charge of the club ended without silverware. The Blues challenged for the league title for most of the season, but ultimately had to settle for the runners-up spot for the second successive season, behind champions Crusaders. One positive for the season was the team&#x27;s record in the four &quot;Big Two&quot; league derbies against Glentoran, of which the Blues won three and drew the other. The lowest point of the season for the team was undoubtedly a shock 1–0 loss against second-tier side Ballyclare Comrades in the second round of the 2014–15 League Cup, while their 2014–15 Irish Cup campaign ended when they were eliminated in the quarter-finals after losing 3–2 to eventual runners-up Portadown.

In May 2015, the Blues were invited to compete in the Setanta Sports Cup scheduled to take place in June 2015. The club declined once again, with inconvenient fixture scheduling still remaining a concern. The competition was ultimately cancelled, when suitable fixture dates could not be agreed upon. With the Blues top of the table after 10 games of the 2015–16 NIFL Premiership season, Feeney&#x27;s reign came to an end in October 2015, when he resigned to become assistant manager (and subsequently the manager) of English Football League Two side Newport County.

Former Northern Ireland striker and the country&#x27;s all-time record international goalscorer David Healy was appointed as Feeney&#x27;s successor, with Andy Todd staying on as Healy&#x27;s assistant manager. However, in January 2016 Todd also departed the club to join Newport County and reunite with Warren Feeney, who had subsequently been promoted to County&#x27;s manager following the departure of John Sheridan. Todd once again became Feeney&#x27;s assistant manager.

Linfield Football Club has scripted a captivating saga in the Northern Irish football scene during the reign of David Healy.

Linfield lifted the 2016/17 Irish League title by a marginal 2 points, with Crusaders F.C. coming second. The Blues also won the Irish Cup.
In the 2018/19 season, Linfield reclaimed the Irish League title after finishing fourth in the previous season.

The curtailed 2019/20 season saw Linfield win the title for a second consecutive season. 
In the same season, Linfield embarked on a memorable European campaign, marginally losing to Qarabag FK in the UEFA Europa League qualification finals after impressive victories over FK Sutjeska Niksic and Havnar Boltfelag in the semi-finals and quarter-finals respectively.

The 2020/21 season (in which Northern Irish football fully returned from COVID-19), saw Coleraine and Glentoran emerge as their primary rivals for the title. In the end, Linfield acquired their third title in a row. They also secured their forty-fourth Irish Cup.

In the 2021/22 season Cliftonville stood as formidable adversaries for the championship, and it all came down to the wire. The Blues clinched the title by a razor-thin one-point margin and remained champions for the fourth season in a row.

Linfield came agonisingly close to reaching the UEFA Conference League proper in the 2022/23 season after losing to FK RFS in the qualification finals. However, the team exhibited a commendable performance throughout this European campaign.
In the domestic league a revamped Larne squad beat Linfield to the NIFL Premiership 2022/23 title after a tight title race between the two teams.

==Stadium==

Since 1905, Windsor Park in south Belfast has been Linfield&#x27;s home ground. In the initial years after the club was formed in 1886, Linfield had to change grounds several times for various reasons such as housing development. The numerous ground changes and the club&#x27;s desire to have a permanent home with which to build an identity resulted in the purchase of a piece of land known as the &#x27;bog meadows&#x27; just off lower Windsor Avenue on 1 October 1904. Later known as Windsor Park, this became the club&#x27;s permanent home as well as the venue for international matches. The first game at Windsor took place on 29 August 1905, with Linfield playing out a 0–0 draw against Distillery in a friendly match arranged to officially commemorate the opening of the stadium. The first competitive game played at the stadium took place just a few days later on 2 September 1905, and ended with a 1–0 win for Linfield over Glentoran – the other half of the &quot;Big Two&quot; Belfast teams – though Belfast Celtic were Linfield&#x27;s main rivals at the time.

Windsor Park is the largest Association football stadium in Northern Ireland, with Glentoran&#x27;s ground, the Oval, being the next largest. The governing body of Northern Irish football, the Irish Football Association, manages the stadium, while Linfield retains ownership of the land. In 2012, Linfield and the IFA were in talks to agree a new 51-year contract for the use of Windsor Park. The club would receive an annual payment as rent for the IFA to use the ground for the Northern Ireland national football team, but would no longer receive 15% of the ticket sales, TV rights, and commercial rights from international matches as they did under the old agreement. The 51-year agreement took effect from May 2014, with Linfield receiving an annual payment of £200,000 - subject to review (being adjusted for inflation etc.) every four years. This was increased to £214,000 per year in 2018, and due to increase again in 2022. The contract will expire in 2065.

In 2010, UEFA provided €500,000 towards substantial refurbishment of the stadium, to increase capacity and improve safety. The following year, the Northern Ireland Executive allocated £138 million for a major programme of stadium redevelopment throughout Northern Ireland, with £28 million allocated to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. In June 2012, further details of the stadium&#x27;s redevelopment were released. The plan was to redevelop Windsor Park into an 18,000 all-seater stadium with a series of phased works originally intended to begin in the middle of 2013. The redevelopment would include the demolition of the existing East and South Stand structures, to be replaced by new purpose built stands that would partially enclose the stadium; complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands; and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA.

In February 2013, planning permission for the redevelopment was granted. The cost of the project was estimated to be around £29.2 million, of which £25.2 million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of State aid towards Linfield. They, along with other Irish League clubs, felt that this gives Linfield an unfair advantage by allowing them to offer more attractive wages and have a larger squad than all of the other clubs. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed that they would not be welcome in the directors box or the boardroom during the game – an apparent reaction to Crusaders&#x27; legal challenge of the stadium redevelopment. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders&#x27; request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was dismissed.

In July 2013, Crusaders agreed to a possible settlement brought forward by the judicial review. The details of the settlement were not made public, but Crusaders said that it had the &quot;potential to benefit the entirety of the football family&quot;. In September 2013, sports minister Carál Ní Chuilín said that she was still committed to making sure the redevelopment went ahead as scheduled, after previously stating that she would not sign off on the funding until the IFA resolved &quot;governance issues&quot; surrounding David Martin&#x27;s return to the role of deputy president.

In December 2013, three months after the work was originally scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light. The sports minister signed off on £31 million to complete the project. The redevelopment finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013–14 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after cracks in the structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium redevelopment had been ongoing behind the stand in the weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known if that was directly related. Originally planned for refurbishment as part of the redevelopment, the West Stand was demolished and rebuilt. The redevelopment was completed in October 2016, with an official capacity of 18,434.

==Supporters and rivalry==

===Big Two rivalry===

Linfield&#x27;s main rival is Glentoran from east Belfast – a rivalry which is commonly referred to as the &quot;Big Two&quot;. However, this term did not always refer to Linfield and Glentoran; until 1949, the &quot;Big Two&quot; consisted of Linfield and Belfast Celtic, for they had traditionally, up to that point, been the two most successful clubs in Northern Irish football. However, after Belfast Celtic withdrew from the league in 1949, Glentoran gradually established itself as Linfield&#x27;s biggest rival. The earliest recorded match between the two clubs was played on 1 October 1887 – just over a year after Linfield&#x27;s formation. A friendly match played at King&#x27;s Field, Westbourne in Ballymacarrett was won 3–1 by Linfield (then known as Linfield Athletic). In 1890, the two teams played each other competitively for the first time, during the inaugural Irish League season. Linfield won 7–0 at Musgrave Park on 18 October, and 6–0 at Ulsterville Avenue on 21 March 1891. The first meeting at the Oval took place on 8 October 1892, and the first meeting at Windsor Park took place 13 years later on 2 September 1905.

During the second World War in 1941, the Oval – including most of Glentoran&#x27;s assets – was severely damaged in a German aerial bombing raid on the nearby Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard. Glentoran approached Distillery F.C to play at Grosvenor Park, which they did until the Oval was rebuilt with help from other clubs. During this time, Glentoran considered resigning from senior football to become a junior club, but after borrowing kits from Distillery and Crusaders they continued to compete at Grosvenor until 1949. Out of 14 league games at Grosvenor Park however, they were only victorious over Linfield on one occasion.

Traditionally, the two clubs play each other in the league on Boxing Day every year, with the match usually attracting the largest attendance of any league match that season. In 2009, the Irish Football Association initially banned the fixture from taking place on Boxing Day for two years due to crowd trouble at Windsor Park. However, this decision was later reversed on appeal, and the fixture returned to the calendar. Ultimately, however, the 2009 and 2010 fixtures did not take place in the end anyway, as they were both postponed due to bad weather. The fixture returned to the fixture list in 2011, with each club hosting the match in alternate years.

===Trophy dominance===
Linfield and Glentoran have been the two most successful clubs in Northern Irish football to date, regularly being the two main contenders for the major domestic honours. They have won more league titles, Irish Cups, and League Cups than any other clubs. Linfield hold the record for the most League titles (56), Irish Cups (44), and League Cups (10). In comparison, Glentoran have won 23 league titles, 23 Irish Cups, and 7 League Cups. Almost half (47.2%) of the 142 Irish Cup competitions to date have been won by one of the two clubs, with at least one of the clubs reaching the final on 92 occasions (64.8% of all finals), winning the cup a combined 67 times. Of those 92 finals, the two clubs have met in 15 of them – making it the most common final. Linfield have won eight of the head-to-head final meetings compared to Glentoran&#x27;s seven wins, with the most recent meeting between the two clubs in the final occurring in 2006, when Linfield won 2–1 to lift the Cup for the 37th time. Almost two-thirds (65.3%) of all Irish League titles have been won by one of the Big Two. Of the 121 completed league seasons, the title has been won by either club on 79 occasions. The duo also make up two of the three clubs that have appeared in every season of the Irish League since its inception in 1890; the other club being Cliftonville.

Up to and including the 2021–22 season, the two clubs have played each other 281 times in the Irish League since its formation in 1890. Linfield have won 126 of the meetings, with 77 Glentoran victories and 78 drawn matches. Linfield&#x27;s record victory over their rivals is 8–0. This occurred on 21 November 1891, during the 1891–92 Irish League season. Linfield&#x27;s record post-war win over Glentoran in all competitions is by a six-goal margin – a 7–1 win over the Glens at Grosvenor Park in the 1961–62 North-South Cup, and a 6–0 victory at Windsor Park in the 2006 Setanta Sports Cup group stage.

Since 2009, the rivalry has not been as intense as it once was, with the Big Two&#x27;s domination of the domestic game decreasing as competitiveness across the league has improved. This is partly due to the resurgence of North Belfast derby rivals Cliftonville and Crusaders, and to a lesser extent Coleraine and Glenavon. In 2013, Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to win the league title since Portadown in 2002. In 2014, Cliftonville went on to retain the title for the first time in their history, with Crusaders then winning the 2014–15 title in convincing fashion, finishing 10 points ahead of runners-up Linfield. During this time, Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013, 2015 and 2020, however the club has gone 13 years without a league title, winning only three titles since the turn of the 21st century; in 2002–03, 2004–05 and 2008–09. Since then, they have finished as low as ninth place in the 2016–17 season. The last season in which the two clubs finished as champions and runners-up in either order was 2008–09, and they have not met in a major domestic cup final since 2006, when they contested both the Irish Cup and the League Cup finals.
===Sectarianism and violence===
Linfield are regarded as a &#x27;Protestant club&#x27; due to them drawing the vast majority of their support from that side of the community. The club has also been regarded as sectarian in the past, both in respect of its alleged employment policy and of the repeated behaviour of its fans. This sectarian reputation is partly the result of the actions of fans who have a history of anti-Catholic behaviour ranging from sectarian chanting on the terraces to outright physical violence. Part of the problem has been attributed to Windsor Park&#x27;s location in a part of Belfast that was once predominantly Protestant. A relatively small number of local Catholics played for the club during the Troubles, which led to a widespread accusation that the club held a historical policy of not signing Catholic players. However, the existence of such a policy has been continually refuted:

Sectarian tensions have long been a cause of conflict at football matches in Northern Ireland since the 1920s, and crowd trouble occasionally marred games involving Linfield throughout the twentieth century. One of the most notable such instances occurred in 1948, at a Boxing Day match between Linfield and Belfast Celtic (a team whose support was largely composed of Catholics and Irish nationalists). Immediately following a 1–1 draw in which Linfield scored in the last minute, there was a pitch invasion by Linfield supporters. In the ensuing violence, three Belfast Celtic players were seriously injured, including Protestant striker Jimmy Jones, who was left unconscious and suffered a broken leg. Belfast Celtic subsequently withdrew from the league in protest at the end of the 1948–49 season.

In the 1979–80 European Cup, Linfield were drawn to face Dundalk from the Republic of Ireland. In the first leg, which was played in Dundalk and ended in a 1–1 draw, crowd disturbance prompted UEFA to switch the second leg to the Haarlem Stadion, Netherlands. Linfield were held almost entirely accountable for the events, and were forced to pay Dundalk&#x27;s costs to travel to the Netherlands as well as an additional £5,000 for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined £870 for providing insufficient security at the match. Dundalk eventually won the match 2–0 to progress 3–1 on aggregate. In the 1987–88 campaign, Linfield&#x27;s home game against Lillestrøm was marred by missile throwing, resulting in UEFA sanctions which meant that the club had to play their next two home games in European competitions at Welsh club Wrexham in 1988–89 and 1989–90.

A 1997 match against Coleraine was abandoned when Linfield fans hurled bottles onto the pitch after two Linfield players were sent off. In May 2005 there were disturbances in Dublin at the Setanta Cup final between Linfield and Shelbourne. In the same month, Linfield fans were banned from travelling to the Oval for a match against Glentoran, allegedly as a result of disturbances involving both sets of fans the previous month. However, Glentoran denied this was the reason behind the ban, citing health and safety regulations that forced them to close the away stand. In 2008, three Linfield fans were charged in a Dublin court with public order offences at a Setanta Cup match against St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic, but were released.

The management of Linfield has continually attempted to reverse the stigma of negative press attached to the club. The club has moved forward in co-operation with the Irish Football Association, which has launched a campaign called &quot;Give sectarianism the boot.&quot; It assisted a local Camogie team who needed space to train in 2005, and also built links with the Gaelic Athletic Association which has traditionally had little support from the Protestant community in Northern Ireland. In 2006 FIFA officially commended Linfield for their anti-racism initiatives. A play dealing with the conflict between Linfield and Belfast Celtic, &quot;Lish and Gerry at the Shrine&quot;, was staged by the IFA at Windsor Park in October 2010, with the co-operation of the Linfield management.

Since 2008, the number of incidents has significantly decreased. However, in February 2014, Linfield were fined £3,000 and Cliftonville were fined £3,250 by the IFA following sectarian chanting from sections of both sets of supporters during a County Antrim Shield semi-final at Windsor Park in October 2013. Cliftonville&#x27;s fine of an extra £250 came as a result of their fans causing a big bang during the game. Both clubs criticised the decision, and expressed their intent to appeal against the fines. In April 2014, the punishments were rescinded on appeal. There was also crowd trouble at a league fixture between the clubs at Windsor Park in March 2014, with reports of missiles being thrown after the game. The Northern Ireland Football League condemned the actions of a &quot;small minority&quot; of supporters.

In May 2014, Linfield were fined £1,200 by the Irish Football Association over the singing of sectarian songs by supporters, ruling that Linfield fans had been guilty of breaching the code of conduct during a league game at Coleraine.

In a Champions League qualifier match on 14 July 2017, some Linfield supporters threw bottles and coins at Celtic players. Although both a section of Linfield fans and the small group of visiting fans sang sectarian songs, it was noted that a much larger section of Linfield fans booed and drowned out these songs.

In 2022, the club reportedly &quot;ended its voluntary association&quot; with one of the coaches of its girls&#x27; academy after the man admitted being involved in singing a chant, which was described as &quot;gratuitous[ly] sectarian&quot; and condemned by senior members of the Orange Order, Ulster Unionists, DUP, Sinn Féin, Alliance Party and the Northern Ireland Secretary of State.

==European record==

As Northern Ireland&#x27;s most dominant club side, Linfield have been regular competitors in European football. The club first participated in European competition in 1959 against Göteborg in the 1959–60 European Cup. In the first round of the 1961–62 European Cup, Linfield were drawn to face an East German team, Vorwärts. The away leg was played, which Linfield lost 3–0. However, Vorwärts were denied visas to enter the UK to play the second leg, and (similarly to Glenavon the previous season) travelling to play the second leg in a neutral country was not financially viable for Linfield. They were therefore forced to withdraw from the competition.

Linfield&#x27;s most notable achievement in European competition to date is reaching the quarter-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup. After beating Aris of Luxembourg and Vålerenga of Norway they faced CSKA Red Flag of Bulgaria in the last eight. This resulted in a 2–2 draw at home and 1–0 defeat away. In the 1984–85 season, after overcoming Shamrock Rovers on away goals (the first and so far only series of meetings between the two Irish superpowers outside all-Ireland tournaments), Linfield faced eventual semi-finalists Panathinaikos in the second round. After a 2–1 defeat in Greece, Linfield raced into a 3–0 lead at half-time in the second leg at Windsor Park. However, Panathinaikos staged a remarkable comeback in the second half to level the match at 3–3 and eliminate Linfield 5–4 on aggregate.

The 1993–94 UEFA Champions League saw Linfield drawn with Dinamo Tbilisi of Georgia. After losing 3–2 on aggregate, they were later reinstated when the Georgian side were expelled from the competition for alleged match fixing and bribing officials. Linfield faced Copenhagen in the first round proper. They won the first leg 3–0, but lost the second leg 4–0 after extra time. This proved costly, as victory would have meant a financially lucrative tie against eventual champions A.C. Milan in the next round. The club then had to wait seven years to participate in the competition again, due to the format of the two European competitions being altered. The league&#x27;s relatively low ranking in the UEFA coefficient system has meant that the club has entered in the early qualifying rounds of either the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with the Blues becoming the first Irish League side to reach the play-off round of the Europa League in 2019. In the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, the Blues entered the competition in the first qualifying round, and defeated B36 Tórshavn 4–3 on penalties to progress to the second qualifying round, after both legs ended as 0–0 draws. This was the first time since the 1984–85 season (excluding their opponent&#x27;s expulsion in 1993–94) that the club had won a tie in the competition. However, they were defeated 3–0 on aggregate in the next round by AEL Limassol.

The 2013–14 UEFA Europa League campaign started in record-breaking fashion. In July 2013, the club won 2–0 away from home against ÍF Fuglafjørður of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round. This was the Blues&#x27; first win in Europe since 2005, and their first away win in Europe since 1966, when they defeated Vålerenga 4–1 during their run to the quarter-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup. In the second leg at Windsor Park, the Blues won 3–0 to go through to the next round 5–0 on aggregate. This was the club&#x27;s largest aggregate victory in a European tie since defeating Aris Bonnevoie 9–4 on aggregate in the first round of the 1966–67 European Cup. It was also the first time that a Northern Irish club had won both legs of a European tie in any competition. They followed this up in the next round by winning away from home again. Despite being massive underdogs for the tie, a 1–0 victory away to Xanthi of Greece made it three consecutive victories in Europe, without conceding a goal in the process – another first for the club. However, in the second leg at home they went down 2–1 after extra time, which eliminated them on the away goals rule.

The following season, Linfield&#x27;s first venture into Europe under new manager Warren Feeney was in the Faroe Islands against B36 Tórshavn in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round, which was also Feeney&#x27;s first competitive game in charge of the club. Linfield came out 2–1 victors with goals coming from Jamie Mulgrew and Michael Carvill. The return leg was played at Glenavon&#x27;s ground, Mourneview Park, due to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. Linfield had to settle for a 1–1 draw, but that was enough to secure passage into the second qualifying round for the second successive season, where they were drawn to face AIK from Sweden. An 87th-minute Andrew Waterworth goal in the home leg at Mourneview Park ensured a 1–0 win for Linfield in their 100th competitive European match since their debut in 1959. However, the Blues fell to a 2–0 defeat in the away leg, which meant they were eliminated 2–1 on aggregate.
As 2018–19 NIFL Premiership champions, Linfield initially entered the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League first qualifying round, where they were drawn to face Rosenborg. In naming Charlie Allen to the final 25-man squad for this match, the Blues set a new record for the youngest UK player named to a final squad for a match in the Champions League. The Norwegian champions had eliminated the Blues from the competition back in the 2010–11 season, and again they proved to be too strong. A 6–0 aggregate defeat saw the Blues drop down into the UEFA Europa League second qualifying round Champions Path, where they faced Faroese champions HB Tórshavn – the fifth occasion since 2012 that they had faced Faroese opposition in Europe. A 3–2 win on aggregate secured a place in the third qualifying round of the Europa League for the first time, and the third stage of any European competition since a 5–2 aggregate win over Vålerenga in November 1966.

In the next round of the Europa League Linfield faced Montenegro champions Sutjeska. A 2–1 win in the away leg was followed up with a 3–2 win in the second leg at Windsor Park, with the Blues winning 5–3 on aggregate to become the first Irish League side to reach the play-off round of the Europa League. It was only the second time that the club had won both legs of a European tie – the first being in 2013 against ÍF. Additionally, it was only the second time that the club had ever progressed through back-to-back rounds in Europe, again the first time since November 1966. In the play-off round, Linfield were drawn to face Azerbaijan champions Qarabağ, with the winners qualifying for the Europa League group stage.

==Managerial history==
Below is a list of the managers Linfield have appointed during the club&#x27;s history. In the early years after the club was formed in 1886, the team was selected by the club committee, a standard practice by football clubs at the time. Since then, 25 different men have held the position of Linfield first team coach/manager. However, only six have been appointed since Billy Campbell&#x27;s departure in 1975. David Jeffrey holds the record for the longest reign as manager, having been in charge for 17 years and 16 weeks between 4 January 1997 and 26 April 2014. Jeffrey and Roy Coyle jointly hold the record for the most trophies won as manager, having led the club to 31 major honours each. Former Northern Ireland international Warren Feeney is the club&#x27;s previous manager, having been appointed in May 2014. He resigned in October 2015 to become assistant manager of Newport County, with current manager David Healy appointed as his successor.

==Records==

===Doubles and trebles===
The club has achieved the double of winning the League title and the national cup in the same season on 25 occasions – more than any other club in the world. The club has also achieved the domestic treble of the League, national cup and League Cup in the same season on three occasions, and a domestic quadruple of those three trophies plus the regional County Antrim Shield in the same season once – in 2005–06. Most notably absent from the list are the seven-trophy hauls in the 1921–22 and 1961–62 seasons– achieved prior to the inauguration of the League Cup in 1987.

<text>Richard J. Maybury (born October 10, 1946) is the publisher of &quot;U.S. &amp; World Early Warning Report for Investors&quot;. He has written several entry level books on United States economics, law, and history from a libertarian perspective. He has written these things in epistolatory form, usually as an uncle writing to his nephew, answering questions. Maybury was a high school economics teacher. After failing to find a book which would give a clear explanation on his view of economics he wrote one himself. Some of his books include &quot;Uncle Eric Talks About Personal, Career &amp; Financial Security&quot;; a book that is basically the foundation for his other books about the model perspective and Higher Law, &quot;Whatever Happened to Penny Candy?&quot;; a book that explains the history of the [United States] economic model and how it was based on free-market Austrian economics, &quot;Whatever Happened to Justice?&quot;; a book about his juris naturalist philosophical viewpoints regarding the foundations of America&#x27;s legal system, British Common Law, the law of the Franks, and early Christian Ireland.

Maybury was born on October 10, 1946, in Hamilton, Ohio, to parents Anthony J., and executive of a West Coast coffee company and co-author of &quot;Common Sense Business for Kids&quot;, and Ruth M. (&quot;née&quot; Wellinghoff) Maybury. He married Marilyn N. Williams on August 7, 1967. He has 4 siblings: David, Linda, Jane, and Debra.

==Theories==

===Juris Naturalism===
Maybury&#x27;s viewpoint is &quot;juris naturalism&quot;. Maybury created the term juris naturalism, and called himself a juris naturalist, because he believed no other label was able to fully describe the concept, which he believed is modeled on the viewpoints of many of America&#x27;s Founders.

===Thousand Year War===
Maybury has had disagreements with those who say that Muslims are terrorists. In his book, &quot;The Thousand Year War&quot;, he says that Muslims have been persecuted as much as the Jews by Western civilization through events such as the Crusades, and that they are retaliating after being wronged by the Europeans and the western culture, including the United States government. Maybury states that Muslim nations and people still treat events that occurred centuries ago as modern-day events, and that the recent attacks are retaliatory strikes against what they perceive to be their long-time enemies. He praises the mediaeval Muslim civilizations for their advances in many fields. He also states that Muslims are responsible for preserving the philosophies of ancient people, such as Aristotle.

===Maybury&#x27;s Two Laws===
Maybury bases his work on common law, namely
* Do all you have agreed to do
* Do not encroach on other persons or their property.

The first law is related to contract law. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties, in which they promise to perform certain actions for and recognize certain rights of the other parties. The second law is related to some criminal law and tort law. Violators of these types of laws have committed acts like theft or violence against other people. (When referencing these two laws, Maybury has at times requested they be known as &quot;Maybury&#x27;s Laws,&quot; and stated exactly as above.) He has also mentioned that there may be another (or others) undiscovered law related to the subjects of law that the two he shows don&#x27;t cover.

===Chaostan===
Maybury has declared that nearly a third of the Earth&#x27;s surface is &quot;Chaostan&quot;, the land of great chaos. Chaostan is in his view prone to war, financial ill, and tyranny because they never received the Two Laws. The area extends from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and Poland to the Pacific, plus North Africa.

===The New Axis===
Maybury thinks it is possible that some or all of the areas in Chaostan are secretly co-operating, either through political alliance or along ancient ethnic lines. This term was first used in May 1996.

==Military Experience==
Maybury was a sergeant in the United States Air Force from 1967 to 1971. He served with the 605th Air Commando Squadron in Central America, and with the 75th Military Airlift Squadron in Vietnam. He was also a General Military Training instructor at Travis Air Force Base; and participated in covert operations in South and Central America.

==Books==
===Themes===
Maybury&#x27;s books are marked with emphasis on paradigms, or &quot;models&quot; as he calls them. One of his books, &quot;Are You Liberal, Conservative, or Confused&quot; is dedicated entirely to this topic. He commonly addresses his letters to an imaginary student named Chris.

===Style===
All of his books are written in the epistolatory style, as letters from the fictitious Uncle Eric to his nephew. The personal tone of the &quot;letters&quot; convey a certain sense of urgency, yet are remarkably understated compared to other revisionist and contrarian viewpoints.

The books have many illustrations, maps and pull-quotations of historical persons. Though, oddly to some, he rarely if ever quotes recent (20th century) writers. Perhaps it is because he distills the essence of free-market economic thought (what we often call &quot;Libertarian&quot;) into fundamental terms that stand on their own. In other words, rather than quoting for instance Henry Hazlitt to support a thesis, he describes an idea in foundational terms that arrive at a conclusion that readers of Hazlitt may find familiar.

===Titles===
Maybury&#x27;s in-print books to date are:
*&quot;Ancient Rome: How It Affects You Today&quot;
*&quot;Are You Liberal? Conservative? or Confused?&quot;
*&quot;Evaluating Books: What Would Thomas Jefferson Think About This?&quot;
*&quot;The Clipper Ship Strategy: For Success in Your Career, Business, and Investments&quot;
*&quot;The Money Mystery: The Hidden Force Affecting Your Career, Business, and Investments&quot;
*&quot;The Thousand Year War in the Mideast&quot;
*&quot;Uncle Eric Talks About Personal, Career, and Financial Security&quot;
*&quot;Whatever Happened to Justice?&quot;
*&quot;Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? 5th Edition&quot;
*&quot;World War I: The Rest of the Story and How It Affects You Today&quot;
*&quot;World War II: The Rest of the Story &amp; How It Affects You Today&quot;
All of his books are published by Bluestocking Press

==Journals &amp; Newspapers==

===EWR===
The US &amp; World Investors Early Warning Report (EWR) is Maybury&#x27;s monthly financial newsletter. EWR seeks to apply the Uncle Eric model to the real world and provide forecasts and warnings of financial changes before they happen. It is very cautious in outlook, and has low toleration of risk.

===Freelance Work===
Following his military experience, but prior to EWR, Maybury was a freelance writer whose works were featured in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot; and other notable publications.

===Moneyworld===
Maybury was previously global affairs editor for Moneyworld

<text>Nicolás Bravo Rueda (10 September 1786 – 22 April 1854) was a Mexican soldier and politician who served as interim President of Mexico three times, in 1839, 1842, and 1846. Previously, he fought in the Mexican War of Independence, and served as Mexico&#x27;s first Vice President under President Guadalupe Victoria from 1824 until 1827, when he attempted to overthrow Victoria. He was also the fourth vice president under President Mariano Paredes in 1846, and served in the Mexican–American War.

He first distinguished himself during the Mexican War of Independence. He was Mexico&#x27;s first Vice President though while holding this office Bravo would try to overthrow President Guadalupe Victoria through the Plan of Montaño in 1827. His revolt failed and in part due to the services Bravo had provided the nation during the War of Independence, he was allowed to live, but nonetheless exiled.

Bravo would return to the country and later go on to serve as interim president of Mexico three separate times in 1839, 1842, and 1846. During his second presidency he oversaw the transition of the Centralist Republic of Mexico to a new constitution known as the Bases Orgánicas. During the Mexican–American War he commanded the Mexican forces at the Battle of Chapultepec.

==Early life==
Bravo was born on 10 September 1786, in Chilpancingo, to a wealthy family. His parents were Leonardo Bravo and . After the Mexican War of Independence broke out in September, 1810, he along with his father, and a brother joined the insurgents. He served directly under his father at first and after two years was able to be in charge of a body of troops that passed to the province of Veracruz and took control of Coscomatepec. After a victory at Palma, he had to experience the defeat, imprisonment, and death of his father. Bravo later gained a reputation for clemency after releasing three hundred royalist prisoners.

Bravo was captured in 1817 in the south of the country and transported to the capital where he remained imprisoned for three years, until he was amnestied by the liberal Spanish government of 1820.

He joined Agustín de Iturbide&#x27;s Plan of Iguala in 1821, and Iturbide named him colonel. The Constituent Congress made him a named him to the council of state and a member of the regency, which governed until Iturbide took over as Emperor of the First Mexican Empire.

==First Mexican Empire==
As Iturbide became more autocratic, and Santa Anna proclaimed the Plan of Veracruz, against him in 1823, Bravo once again decided to fight against the government. He left Mexico City on 5 January 1823, being joined by Vicente Guerrero, and they planned to raise a revolution in the south of the country, carrying with them a copy of the Plan of Vera Cruz which had been sent to them by Santa Anna. He received money for his campaign from María Petra Teruel de Velasco, wife of Antonio Velasco a passionate supporter of the movement, and who had to pawn some jewels in order to gather all the required funds. Iturbide was alerted of Bravo and Guerrero&#x27;s whereabouts through the mayor of Mexicaltzingo, and promptly set a lieutenant colonel after them, but Bravo was able to evade capture by simply bribing him.

Brigadier José Gabriel de Armijo, commander of the South, however now went after them and a skirmish ensued in the vicinity of Almolonga, where they were then defeated. Guerrero was shot through the lungs and his men fled the scene in panic, in spite of Bravo&#x27;s efforts to stop them, believing Guerrero to be dead.

Bravo fled to the Santa Rosa ranch, and from here he sought to reorganize at the Mixteca region where he intended to join up at Huajuapam with Antonio Leon. He fortified himself at a place called the Junta de los Rios. From there he headed towards Oaxaca. Bravo was in the process of arranging a governing junta when he learned of the Plan of Casa Mata. With the troops that he was able to gather at Oaxaca, he headed out and entered the capital with the rest of the insurgent army. Emperor Iturbide restored congress and offered his abdication. When congress decreed that Iturbide be moved to Tulancingo, the former emperor chose that Bravo escort him and his family, although it later seemed Iturbide lost his trust in Bravo as he asked his guards to keep a watch over him.

==First Republic==
After Iturbide was deposed, Bravo was made a member of the Supreme Executive Power, the triumvirate now serving as the executive. During this period he continued to pacify the country and carried out a victorious campaign in Jalisco against the Iturbidist General Luis de Quintanar.

===Vice-Presidency===
During the newly established First Mexican Republic, Bravo allied himself with the Centralist party, preferring a strong unitary government for the country, and to which were also allied various conservative interests ranging from the remaining Spaniards in the country, to the upper classes, to the clergy. Politics in Mexico at this time was associated with Masonic lodges, and the conservatives met within lodges of the Scottish Rite, consequently being known as the &quot;Escoceses&quot; and in which Bravo acquired a position of leadership. The Escoceses were opposed by the federalists, who preferred the country to be governed by a federal system, and with which were associated various liberal causes. They too met within Masonic lodges but were rather followers of the York Rite, and so were known as &quot;Yorkinos&quot;. Mexico&#x27;s constitution, following the American, decreed that in a presidential election the winner becomes president while second place became vice president. In the elections of 1824, Bravo was elected to be the nation&#x27;s first vice-president and the Independence War hero, Guadalupe Victoria was elected president, but the two men belonged to opposite parties, with the latter being a &quot;Yorkino&quot; and the former being an &quot;Escoses&quot;.

On 23 December 1827, the Escoceses, led by Vice President Bravo, proclaimed the , demanding the expulsion of the American ambassador Joel Poinsett, the end to secret societies, and the dismissal of the current cabinet, the latter measure due to the belief that the Yorkino dominated government was about to take decisive measures to suppress the Escoceses. The insurrection was short-lived and Bravo was defeated at Tulancingo by his former ally Vicente Guerrero.

Bravo was tried before a grand jury, and the case went to the Supreme Court. Although the law prescribed a severe punishment for his treason, his services during the Mexican War of Independence won him sympathy from his old colleagues who asked for clemency, and even President Guadalupe Victoria preferred leniency, so the court simply condemned him to banishment for two years.

===Further military career===
He departed from Acapulco to South America and on the journey he lost his only child. His banishment was shortened due to an amnesty granted by President Vicente Guerrero, and Bravo returned to Mexico in 1829.

He continued to be a supporter of the Conservative Party and when and joined the Plan of Jalapa against President Guerrero that same year. After personally going out to lead his troops against the insurrection, President Guerrero was deposed at the capital in January 1830 and replaced by the conservative Anastasio Bustamante. Guerrero however remained at large and continued to wage warfare against the government in the south of the country when Bravo occupied the port and fortress of Acapulco, to remove an important source of wealth from Guerrero and his supporters, but Bravo was dislodged from the city. Bravo however was later victorious at Chilpancingo in January 1831, for which congress granted him a sword of honor, considering that the victory was a decisive defeat against the ongoing operations of Guerrero.

Anastasio Bustamante&#x27;s conservative government fell during through an insurrection known as the Plan of Veracruz in 1832, but Bravo was reluctant to recognize the rebels, but Santa Anna, who had played a key role in the Plan of Veracruz, eventually won him over.

==Centralist Republic of Mexico==
In 1834, the nation would experience a revolution that would eventually result in a new constitution, and the inauguration of the Centralist Republic of Mexico. In 1836, shortly after Mexico lost Texas, Bravo was in charge of the army of the north, but he retired, disgusted by the events, to Chilpancingo.

===First Presidency===
Anastasio Bustamante had meanwhile returned to the presidency and in 1839, Bravo was invited to be a part of his council of state, resulting that when Bustamante temporarily stepped down from the presidency to lead the troops against the rebellion of Jose Urrea, Bravo on 10 July 1839, was named by congress the interim president of the Republic.

There was much dissatisfaction with the state of the country at this time, and a great public clamor for constitutional reform, which included many generals and commanders. President Bravo wished for such concerns to be addressed through legal channels, and he directed his council of state to urge the Supreme Moderating Power, a governing council that according to the constitution was above even the president, to declare that it was the will of the nation to reform the constitution, at the direction of the national representatives, without waiting for a more suitable time.

This first presidency would ultimately last only nine days and yet Bravo treated his duties with energy and dedication. When the criminal Yanez, condemned to death by hanging for highway robbery, slit his own throat to avoid the hangman, friends of the family pleaded that the body not be displayed in public, but Bravo decreed that the body be displayed on the gallows anyway to serve as a warning.

===Second Presidency===
Bravo would next become president in 1842 during which the Centralist Republic of Mexico experienced a constitutional change. In response to multiple national crises, on 8 August 1841, Mariano Paredes had proclaimed against the government of Anastasio Bustamante, and when his insurgent troops reached the city of Tacubaya they were joined by Santa Anna. After failing to put down the insurgency, Bustamante officially surrendered power through the Estanzuela Accords on 6 October 1841. A military junta was formed which wrote the Bases of Tacubaya, a plan which swept away the entire structure of government, except the judiciary, and also called for elections for a new constituent congress meant to write a new constitution.

The subsequent congress which was installed on 10 June 1842, was strongly federalist, against the wishes of the organizers of the Bases of Tacubaya who were strongly centralist. Santa Anna began to scheme to dissolve the congress, and left Bravo in charge of the presidency on 26 October 1842. Bravo was not in accord with Santa Anna&#x27;s schemes for while he too was a centralist, he did not wish to overturn the results of the election which had led to the strongly federal congress. Tornel the minister of war was the real power at the capital at this time, being the favorite of Santa Anna.

President Bravo assured a commission sent by congress, that he would accept the new constitution, and congress continued working on its draft, when its work was interrupted by a pronunciamiento in the obscure town of Huejotzingo, calling for the dissolution of congress, and demanding the installation of a council of notables to work on the new constitution. Minister Tornel was among the conspirators promoting the revolution. In spite of his earlier reluctance to go against congress and reassurance towards them, at the decisive hour, Bravo sided with the insurrectionists and on 19 December, he signed a decree signed by Bocanegra, Velez, Gorostiza, and Tornel dissolving congress and decreeing that they be replaced by a Junta of Notables.

In the early dawn hours of that day there had been skirmishes in the Ciudadela and throughout the morning the Celaya Battalion had remained stationed in the corridor contiguous to the hall where congress met in order to prevent the deputies from entering. Most of them met at the home of the president of the congress Francisco Elorriaga and they directed a memo to President Bravo, asking him if they could continue their sessions, and the reply explained that &quot;every garrison has pronounced against congress except myself and the commandant general of Mexico State.&quot; Most deputies then agreed to publish a manifesto explaining that the executive which had long been interfering with their labors had now used armed forces to dissolve the congress.

While Bravo himself was against the dissolution of congress made it so that the Junta of Notables would be composed of individuals known for their knowledge and patriotism. The Junta was to last six months, during which the Bases of Tacubaya would reign as a provisional constitution. The council of government would continue to function. Another decree on 23 December declared that the Junta of Notables would call itself the national legislature, and the eighty individuals who were to make it up were finally named.

The Junta opened its sessions on 6 January 1843, and General Valencia and Quintana Roo were elected president and vice president of the congress respectively. The Departmental Juntas which had not supporter the Bases of Tacubaya were dissolved. During this time President Bravo established the medical-military Health Corp, and also established a mint in Culicacan. He also recruited four hundred forty men into the military and declared that official stationery must only use paper manufactured in Mexico.

Bravo and Santa Anna became suspicious of Mariano Paredes who had played such a key role in establishing the Bases of Tacubaya, but who now began to express dissatisfaction with the government. He was invited to join the Junta and then made commandant general of Mexico State, and later arrested for speaking against the government, but eventually acquitted. Bravo would eventually resign on 5 May, after growing tired of playing the role of Santa Anna&#x27;s puppet.

==Mexican–American War==
Bravo retired temporarily from politics until the end of 1844, when he was called by the government to help suppress an uprising that had flared up in Chilapa. The insurrection was being carried out by individuals who had published no political manifesto, and were simply looting properties. Meanwhile, a revolution had begun against the government of Santa Anna and Valentin Canalizo, and eventually Jose Joaquin Herrera ascended to the presidency on 6 December 1844. Bravo was named head of the national armies, and went after the deposed Santa Anna.

Bravo joined in the revolution, when the conservative Mariano Paredes overthrew the government of Herrera in late 1845, claiming that the president was committing treason by attempting to recognize the independence of Texas. Paredes was elected president by a junta on 3 January, and Bravo was elected vice-president. Bravo was awarded by making him commandant general and governor of the department of Mexico, when the Mexican–American War had already begun in April 1846. He was named general and chief of the forces destined for the departments of Puebla, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco, and he published a proclamation calling for the unity of all parties.

Amidst increasing opposition to his policies, and the conduct of the war which had been so far a grievous set of defeats for Mexico, Mariano Paredes stepped down and passed the presidency over to Bravo on 28 July 1846.

===Third Presidency===
Bravo was summoned to the capital from the department of Veracruz where he was in the middle of fortifying the city against a potential assault, and replaced with General Mosso. Four days after he assumed the presidency, on 3 August, the garrison of Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulua revolted, proclaiming the plan of Guadalajara, and early on the morning of 4 August, General Salas with more than a thousand troops revolted in the capital. The former president Paredes fled the city on that same night, intending to go off to the front to lead some troops he had dispatched, but he was arrested and sent back by General Avalos. At a conference held by the belligerents, including Vizcaino Lemus, and Jose Ramon Pacheco, Martin Carrera, Jose Urrea, and Ramon Moralies, on 6 August it was agreed that Bravo should step down. Power would pass over to General Salas.

===Battle of Chapultepec===
Bravo continued to participate in the war effort, and was named commandant general of the Department of Puebla, but he retreated from that city when orders arrived to fall back on the capital. He took part in the efforts to defend the capital and he was assigned to the southern boundary of the city, which had previously belonged to General Andrade. After the defeats of Molino del Rey and Casa Mata he was placed in charge of defending the Chapultepec with two thousand troops, with Monterde, director of the fortifications there, as his second-in-command. The place began to be bombarded on 12 September, and an assault followed the next day, which ultimately ended in a Mexican defeat, and Bravo was taken prisoner.

During the Battle of Chapultepec, Bravo had asked for reinforcements and only the Battalion of San Blas commanded by Xicotencatl could help. Bravo&#x27;s reputation suffered in the aftermath of the loss, for in the official report by Santa Anna he assured that Bravo had been taken prisoner after hiding in a waterlogged trench, submerged up to the neck, after which he was recognized by his white hair. 

==Later life==
After the war Bravo attempted to defend his reputation. He retired to Chilpancingo where he lived in obscurity until he died in April 1854. He had coincidentally died on the same day as his wife, leading to rumors that both had been murdered. The fact that Santa Anna at the time was in the vicinity fighting the insurrection that had flared up due to the Plan of Ayutla, also gave rise to rumors that he may have been involved in their deaths.

<text>Learjet was a manufacturer of business jets for civilian and military use based in Wichita, Kansas, United States. Founded in the late 1950s by William Powell Lear as Swiss American Aviation Corporation, it became a subsidiary of Canadian Bombardier Aerospace in 1990, which marketed the company’s aircraft as the &quot;Bombardier Learjet Family&quot;. The 3,000th Learjet was delivered in June 2017. The Learjet line was once sufficiently popular that the Learjet name became synonymous and interchangeable with the terms business jet or private jet in the popular vernacular. In February 2021, Bombardier announced the end of production for all new Learjet aircraft in 2021, with the continuation of support and maintenance for aircraft currently in service.

==History==
Learjet was one of the first companies to manufacture a private, luxury aircraft. Lear&#x27;s preliminary design was based upon an experimental American military aircraft known as the Marvel, substituting fuselage-mounted turbojet engines for ducted fan turboshaft engines. However, that preliminary design was abandoned and the final Learjet design was instead adapted from an abortive 1950s Swiss ground-attack fighter aircraft, the FFA P-16.

The basic structure of the Swiss P-16 aircraft was seen by Bill Lear and his team as a good starting point to the development of a business jet, and formed the Swiss American Aircraft Corporation, located in Altenrhein, Switzerland, and staffed with design engineers from Switzerland, Germany and Britain. The aircraft was originally intended to be called the SAAC-23. The wing with its distinctive tip fuel tanks and landing gear of the first Learjets were little changed from those used by the fighter prototypes. Although building the first jet started in Switzerland, the tooling for building the aircraft was moved to Wichita, Kansas, in 1962. Bill Jr stated that it took too long to get anything done in Switzerland despite the cheaper labor costs. LearJet was in a temporary office which opened in September 1962 while the plant at Wichita&#x27;s airport was under construction. On February 7, 1963, assembly of the first Learjet began. The next year, the company was renamed the Lear Jet Corporation.

The original Learjet 23 was a six- to eight-seater and first flew on October 7, 1963, with the first production model being delivered in October 1964. Just over a month later, Lear Jet became a publicly owned corporation. Several derived models followed, with the Model 24 first flying on February 24, 1966, and the Model 25 first flying on August 12, 1966. On September 19 of the same year, the company was renamed Lear Jet Industries Inc.

===Merger with Gates Aviation===

On April 10, 1967, Bill Lear&#x27;s approximately 60% share of the venture was acquired by the Gates Rubber Company of Denver, Colorado, for US$ 27 million (). Lear remained on the company board until April 2, 1969, when the company was merged with Gates Aviation Corporation and was renamed Gates Learjet Corporation. In 1971, the first Model 25 powered by a Garrett TFE731-2 turbofan engine was flown. This aircraft later became the successful Learjet 35. That year, the company was awarded the President&#x27;s &quot;E&quot; Award for promoting export sales.

In 1974, the worldwide Learjet fleet had exceeded the one-million flight hours mark and, in 1975, the company produced its 500th jet, both industry firsts. By late 1976, the company increased monthly aircraft production to ten.

On August 24, 1977, the Learjet 28 made its first flight. It was based on the Learjet 25, but received a completely new wing fitted with winglets. These resulted in both improved performance and fuel economy and inspired the name &quot;Longhorn&quot; for the short-lived Learjet 28/29 and for some of the more successful models that followed.

On April 19, 1979, the prototype for the Model 54/55/56 series made its first flight, and on July 7, 1983, a standard production Model 55 set six new time-to-climb records for its weight class.

In 1984, Gates Learjet announced the start of their Aerospace Division, a high technology endeavor. However, by the end of the year the company had ceased production of its commercial jets in an effort to reduce inventories. This lasted until February 1986, when the company headquarters were transferred to Tucson, Arizona, and production was restarted both in Wichita and Tucson.

On September 10, 1985, the Aerospace Division was awarded a contract to produce parts for the Space Shuttle&#x27;s main engines. In 1987, Gates Learjet was acquired by Integrated Acquisition and the next year the name was changed to Learjet Corporation. By January 1989, all production had been moved from the Tucson facility back to Wichita with an employment of 1,250.

===Acquisition by Bombardier===
In 1990, Canadian company Bombardier Aerospace purchased the Learjet Corporation. The aircraft were then marketed as the &quot;Bombardier Learjet Family&quot;. On October 10, 1990, the Learjet 60 mid-sized aircraft had its first flight, followed on October 7, 1995, by the Learjet 45.

In October 2007, Bombardier Learjet launched a brand new aircraft program, the Learjet 85. It was the first FAR Part-25 all-composite business aircraft.
Bombardier celebrated the 45th anniversary of the first flight by a Learjet with 2008&#x27;s &quot;Year of Learjet campaign&quot;. One of its highlights was British Formula One racing driver Lewis Hamilton racing a Learjet and winning an event at the Farnborough Air Show.
On October 28, 2015 Bombardier announced cancellation of the Learjet 85 program.

On February 11, 2021, Bombardier announced the end production of all Learjet aircraft. Bombardier also announced they would continue to fully support the Learjet fleet well into the future, and launched the Learjet RACER re-manufacturing program for the Learjet 40 and Learjet 45 aircraft.
As Bombardier focuses on its larger Challenger and Global jets, the final aircraft, a Learjet 75, was delivered on 28 March 2022 after 60 years of production, delivering more than 3,000 aircraft, of which more than 2,000 remain in service.

===Location===
Learjet started off in Wichita, Kansas, and as of 2013 has over 3,200 employees. Wichita was not the only candidate for the location of Lear&#x27;s project. Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Ohio were also both locations that were being considered. There were already a few other aircraft companies that were located in Kansas, which meant there were many more potential workers who would possess the skills that Lear needed to run his company in the design and manufacturing of the aircraft. Lear was offered an industrial revenue bond of 1.2 million US dollars. This would be known as the first historical industrial revenue bond offered by the city. To this day, the Learjet facility is still located in Wichita, Kansas, and is currently getting ready to be renovated, by expanding the Flight Test Center and building a new center for delivery.

Patara was referred to as Patar in Hittite texts: &quot;King Tudhaliya IV (1236-1210 BC), after the Lukka expedition, came to this city with his army and made offerings.&quot;

===Iron Age===
The city was said to have been founded by Patarus (), a son of Apollo. It was noted during antiquity for the temple and oracle of Apollo, second only in importance to that of Delphi. The god is often given the surname &quot;Patareus&quot;. Herodotus says that the oracle of Apollo was delivered by a priestess only during a certain period of the year, and Servius mentions that this period was the six winter months. It seems certain that Patara received Dorian settlers from Crete; and the worship of Apollo was certainly Dorian.

Ancient writers mentioned Patara as one of the principal cities of Lycia. It was Lycia&#x27;s primary seaport, and a leading city of the Lycian League, having 3 votes, the maximum.

The city, with the rest of Lycia, surrendered to Alexander the Great in 333 BC. During the Wars of the Diadochi, it was occupied in turn by Antigonus and Demetrius, before finally falling to the Ptolemies. In this period the first city walls were built. Strabo informs us that Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt, who enlarged the city, gave it the name of Arsinoë after Arsinoe II of Egypt, his wife and sister, but it continued to be called by its ancient name, Patara. Antiochus III captured Patara in 196 BC and it became the capital of Lycia. The Lycian League was formally established in 176 BC.

The Rhodians occupied the city and as a Roman ally, the city with the rest of Lycia was granted autonomy in 167 BC. In 88 BC, the city suffered siege by Mithridates VI, king of Pontus and was captured by Brutus and Cassius, during their campaign against Mark Antony and Augustus. It was spared the massacres that were inflicted on nearby Xanthos. Patara was formally annexed by the Roman Empire in 43 AD and attached to Pamphylia.

Patara is mentioned in the New Testament as the place where Paul of Tarsus and Luke changed ships. The city was Christianized early, and several early bishops are known; according to Le Quien, they include:

*Methodius, dubious, more probably bishop of Olympus
*Eudemus, present at the Council of Nicaea (325)
*Eutychianus, at the Council of Seleucia (359)
*Eudemus, at the Council of Constantinople (381)
*Cyrinus, at the Council of Chalcedon (451)
*Licinius, at the Council of Constantinople (536)
*Theodulus, at the Council of Constantinople (879-880)

Saints Leo and Paregorius were martyred at Patara around 260 AD.
Nicholas of Myra was born at Patara around March 15, 270 AD.

In the 5th century AD the city was reduced in size through the construction of a strong fortification wall adjoining the Bouleuterion using stone from the nearby structures.

Patara is mentioned among the Lycian bishoprics in the Acts of Councils (Hierocl. p. 684). The &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; mention it among the suffragans of Myra as late as the thirteenth century.

The city remained of some importance during the Byzantine Empire as a way-point for trade and pilgrims. After the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum acquisition in 1211 the city declined and appears to have been deserted by 1340.

With the demise of the bishopric as a residential see, Patara became a titular see and is included as in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of such sees.

It was one of the four largest settlements in the Xanthos Valley and the only one open to the sea, situated 60 stadia to the southeast of the mouth of the river.

==Archaeology==
In 1836 the French archaeologist Charles Texier explored the site followed by Charles Fellows in 1838.

Excavations were begun in 1988 and only in 1991 was the Bouleuterion recognised.

In 1993 the &quot;Stadiasmus Patarensis&quot; was unearthed, a monumental Roman pillar on which is inscribed in Greek a dedication to Claudius and an official announcement of roads being built by the governor, Quintus Veranius Nepos, in the province of Lycia et Pamphylia, giving place names and distances, essentially a monumental public itinerarium. The pillar is on display in the garden of the Antalya Museum.

The site is currently being excavated each year by a team of Turkish archaeologists. At the end of 2007, all the sand had been cleared from the theatre and some other buildings, and the columns on the main street had been partially re-erected (with facsimile capitals). The excavations revealed masonry in remarkable condition.

In 2020 several discoveries were made:
*a 10th statue of a woman from the theatre.
*a kitchen and a &quot;women&#x27;s room&quot;, with mirrors, ornaments and fragrance pots, from the 4th c. BC. These rooms, known as gynaeconitis, were located away from the residence&#x27;s entrance in order to minimise contact with men from outside the family, and were where women nursed their children, wove thread and wool
*a cylindrical ancient Greek altar carved with a coiled snake.

The site of the oracle and temple of Apollo have not been found.

==Description==
===Location===

The site is a plain surrounded by hills and included in ancient times a large natural harbour, since silted up. Northeast of the harbour is Tepecik Hill upon which there is a Bronze Age site and which was the acropolis on which the city was founded. The city later spread to the south and west of the hill.

===Monuments===


The theatre was rebuilt under Antoninus Pius in 147 AD after an earthquake; its diameter is 265 feet, and held about 6000 spectators.

The Bouleuterion or prytaneion is well-preserved and has been further restored. It was the capital&#x27;s assembly hall of the Lycian League and overlooked the theatre the Agora in the East. It was constructed in the early 1st century BC and held about 1400 people. In the centre of the cavea is a tribunalia, seats reserved for governors. The first alterations, when the cavea was enlarged and the semicircular wall in the west was connected to the northern and southern walls, are linked to the annexation of Lycia as a Roman province, most probably under Claudius (r. 43-51 AD) or Nero (r. 51–69). After a major earthquake in 142/143 AD a stoa was added outside and a stage building inside, as it was also to be used as a concert hall (Odeion). In the 5th c. AD it was incorporated into the new fortification wall as a bastion.

The main street connected the inner harbour to the Agora and is one of the widest and best-preserved streets in Lycia. Both sides of the street are lined with Ionic-order colonnades, with granite columns on the east and marble columns on the west.

The well-preserved Arch of Medustus is the north gate of the city and a magnificent triple vaulted triumphal arch built by the citizens of Patara in about 100 AD in honour of Mettias Medustus, the Governor of Lycia.

Several baths are known; the harbour (or datepalm) baths, the Vespasian (or Nero) baths, central baths, small baths and Byzantine baths.

The lighthouse stood at the entrance to the major naval and trading port of Lycia, which had an outer and an inner harbour. It was built in 60 AD during the reign of Nero, according to an inscription, and is one of the oldest surviving. It has a unique structure rising 26 m on a magnificent 3-tiered square base.

Hadrian&#x27;s Granary, so-named as it was built during his visit in 131 AD, lies on the side of the ancient harbour for storage of cereals and other goods to be shipped to Rome. It is 75m x 25m and was divided into 8 sections.

Parts of the site have been subject to illegal construction for agriculture, hotels and holiday villages despite legal protection, and destruction and vandalism are continuing problems.

The harbour is still apparent but it is a swamp, choked up with sand and bushes.

The aqueduct, which was built under Claudius and renovated under Vespasian after an earthquake, was 22.5 km long. It comprised five bridges as well as a rare inverted siphon or pressurised pipeline which is still largely intact. The siphon avoided the construction of tall expensive arches across a valley to support an open channel but instead had the problem of containing the water pressure in the siphon in an era when large diameter piping was difficult to make and seal. The pipes were carved from marble blocks with internal diameter of 0.28 m, each weighing up to 900 kg, laid on top of a 200 m long, 10 m high wall across an 18 m deep valley.

<text>Pułtusk () is a town in Poland, by the river Narew. Located north of Warsaw in the Masovian Voivodeship, it has a population of 19,224 as of 2023. Known for its historic architecture and Europe&#x27;s longest paved marketplace ( in length), it is a popular weekend destination for the residents of Warsaw.

Pułtusk is one of the oldest towns in Poland, having received town rights from Duke Siemowit I of Masovia in 1257. Throughout the 15th and 17th centuries, the settlement was a significant economic centre of Masovia. The favourable geographical placement of the town on the Narew, along which goods were transported to the port of Gdańsk on the Baltic Sea, contributed to the town&#x27;s importance. Pułtusk was also the site of notable events, such as the Napoleon&#x27;s 1806 battle, and the world&#x27;s largest meteorite shower to date in 1868, among others.

== History ==
===Middle Ages===

The town has existed since at least the 10th century. In the Middle Ages, the Castle in Pułtusk was one of the most important defensive forts in northern Masovia against the attacks of Old Prussians and Lithuanians. According to a legend, the town initially was known as &quot;Tusk&quot;; however, after a flood that destroyed half of the city, it was renamed as Pułtusk (&quot;Pół-&quot; or &quot;puł-&quot; being a Polish prefix for a half). Most historians believe that it was named after a small river known as &quot;Pełta&quot;.

From the 11th century onwards, the town belonged to the bishops of Płock. Due to a ford on the river located nearby, Pułtusk became an important centre of trade and commerce. It received its civic charter in 1257, modelled after that of Chełmno (Kulm Law). In 1440 an academy was founded in the town, and it became one of the most influential schools of higher education in the Polish Kingdom. Among its professors were Jakub Wujek and Piotr Skarga. By 1595 there were more than 600 students, and their number reached 900 by 1696.

The town was destroyed by Lithuanians in 1262 and 1324. In the 14th century, Pułtusk became the official seat of Płock bishops. The town was again burnt by Lithuanians in 1368, but following the Union of Krewo between Poland and Lithuania, the Lithuanian raids were stopped, and the town quickly recovered.

By the 15th century Pułtusk&#x27;s merchants were among the richest in Poland. The town was granted a privileges of organizing nine grand fairs a year and two small markets a week. The city also gained much profit from exporting wood and grain to Gdańsk, as well as from mead and beer production.

In around 1405, the Mayor&#x27;s House, today known as the &quot;Polonia House&quot; or &quot;Polonia Castle&quot;, was constructed. In 1449 a Gothic church was added to the city&#x27;s facilities. In the 16th century the castle was rebuilt by several renowned Italian architects, including Giovanni Battista of Venice and Bartolommeo Berrecci, and Giovanni Cini of Siena.

===Early modern period===
Pułtusk was located in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. In 1530 the first Masovian printing house was opened. In 1566 one of the first public theatres in Poland was established in Pułtusk. In the 16th century the town was visited by many notable individuals, such as King Sigismund III Vasa, and poets Jan Kochanowski and Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski.

On 21 April 1703 during the Great Northern War, a decisive battle was fought in Pułtusk, where the Swedish army under Charles XII defeated and captured a large part of the Saxon army under Graf von Steinau. Although the town and the castle were initially conquered by Polish forces, they were later recaptured by the Swedish army, which looted and destroyed it.

After the Partitions of Poland, the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. The Polish forces of General Antoni Madaliński stationed in Pułtusk in 1794 declined to obey Prussian orders and started their march towards Kraków. This marked the start of the Kościuszko Uprising. Prussian rule lasted only a few years.

===Under the partitions===

Another Battle of Pułtusk was fought on 26 December 1806, between forces of Imperial Russia and Imperial France. The battle became so famous that its name is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. After the fall of Warsaw in 1809, Pułtusk became the temporary capital of the Duchy of Warsaw. After the fall of Napoléon Bonaparte, the town became part of so-called Congress Poland within the Russian Partition of Poland.

In 1811 a new ship-of-the-line of the French navy was named &quot;Pulstuck&quot;, to commemorate this battle. This ship of 74 guns of the &quot;Téméraire-&quot;class was built in Antwerp. Only after the &quot;Danish&quot; crew of the ship remarked about the spelling of the name, this was corrected to &quot;Pultusk,&quot; with an icy comment from the emperor that &quot;the French people didn&#x27;t know their victories.&quot; After the fall of the French empire the ship was transferred to the new Dutch navy and named Waterloo &quot;(I)&quot;.

During the November Uprising, the town changed hands several times. In 1831 Russian forces were carrying a cholera epidemic when they entered the town, resulting in high fatalities. Pułtusk inhabitants took part also in the January Uprising. Afterwards the town was utterly destroyed and Russian officials sent many prominent citizens to Siberia and internal exile. On 30 January 1868 a meteorite fell in Pułtusk. It was one of the biggest to fall in Europe. Large chunks ( each) were acquired by the British Museum, which has them on display in London.

Although, the first Jews settled in the town in the 15th century, the Jewish community only started to flourish in the 19th century after a large influx of Jews. At the start of the 19th century, about 120 Jews lived in the city. Others lived in shtetls outside the city. Throughout the 19th century, though, the Jewish population increased rapidly to nearly 7,000 in the mid-19th century as a result of Russian discriminatory policies and the expulsion of Jews from Russia to Russian-controlled Congress Poland (see &quot;Pale of Settlement&quot;). By the year 1900, around 6,000 Jews lived in Pułtusk. Many had migrated to nearby Warsaw before and after World War I. Others emigrated to the United States.

The great fire in 1875 destroyed most of the city. It was depicted by Nobel Laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz in his novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; as the great fire of Rome.
During the First World War Pultusk was the scene of another battle on 13 July 1915 when German forces attempted to cross the river Narew at Pułtusk. The 40th Infantry Division and the 50th Infantry Division of the imperial Russian Army successfully prevented them.

===Interbellum and World War II===
The town was reintegrated with Poland, when the country regained independence following World War I in 1918. During the Polish-Soviet War, it was fiercely defended by Poles on August 9–10, 1920, at the eve of the Battle of Warsaw. On August 13, the Russians captured the town, and then they massacred captured Polish soldiers. On August 17, the Polish 9th Infantry Division recaptured the town. In the interbellum the Polish 13th Infantry Regiment was stationed in Pułtusk. According to the 1921 census, the town had a population of 13,504, 56.6% Polish and 43.4% Jewish.

As a result of the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Pułtusk was occupied by the Wehrmacht on September 7, 1939, and incorporated into Nazi Germany. Already on September 12–13, 1939, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; entered the town to commit atrocities against the population. Nazi Germany operated a police prison, court prison and forced labour camp in the town. The German police carried out executions of Poles in the local prison in November and December 1939. During the German occupation, approximately 50% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants, mostly Jews, were expelled or deported, some to Nazi concentration camps. In 1941-1945 it was renamed in German as &quot;Ostenburg&quot;, to erase traces of Polish origin. On December 17, 1942, the Gestapo carried out a public execution of four members of the Home Army, the leading Polish resistance organization. In the battle for Pułtusk during later World War II, over 16,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army were killed. As a result of the battle, approximately 85% of the city was destroyed.
On September 27, the Germans deported most of the Jews to concentration camps. Some eventually made their way to the Soviet border but many died in the camps. In the 21st century, descendants of Pułtusk Jewry are found mainly in Israel, the United States, Canada, and Argentina.

===Modern times===
In 1950, a rail line connecting Pułtusk with Nasielsk Railway Station was built.

In 1975, the Science Center of the Mazovian Center for Scientific Research was opened in the town.
In 1993, Pułtusk hosted the first ever biennial meeting of the World International Advisory Committee of UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Programme to discuss and inscribe items onto the Register.
