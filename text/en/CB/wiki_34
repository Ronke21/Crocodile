<text>Roatán () is an island in the Caribbean, about off the northern coast of Honduras. The largest of the Bay Islands of Honduras, it is located between the islands of Utila and Guanaja. It is approximately long, and less than across at its widest point. The island consists of two municipalities: José Santos Guardiola in the east and Roatán, including the Cayos Cochinos, in the west. The island was formerly known in English as Ruatan and Rattan.

==Geography==
Roatán is a coral island. Situated atop an exposed ancient coral reef, it rises to about above sea level. The easternmost quarter of the island is separated by a 15-meter-wide channel through the mangrove forest. This section is called Helene, or &quot;Santa Elena&quot; in Spanish. Satellite islands at the eastern end are Morat, Barbareta, and Pigeon Cay.

Most of the infrastructure is on the western half of the island. The most populous town of the island is Coxen Hole, capital of Roatán municipality, located in the southwest. West of Coxen Hole are the settlements of Gravel Bay, Flowers Bay and Keyhole Bay on the south coast, and Sandy Bay, West End and West Bay on the north coast. To the east of Coxen Hole are several cays, including Jesse Arch Cay, Sarah Cay, and Second Cay. Further to the east are the settlements of Mount Pleasant, French Harbour, French Cay, First Bight, Parrot Tree, Jonesville and Oakridge on the south coast, and Punta Gorda on the north coast.

==History==
The indigenous people of the Bay Islands are believed to have been related to either the Paya, the Maya, the Lenca or the Tolupan, which were the tribes present on the mainland. Christopher Columbus visited the neighboring island of Guanaja on his fourth voyage (1502–1504). Soon after, the Spanish began trading in the islands for slave labour. More devastating for the local people was exposure to infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, such as smallpox and measles.

Throughout the European colonial era, the Bay of Honduras attracted an array of individual settlers, pirates, traders and military forces. Various economic activities were engaged in and political struggles played out between the European powers, chiefly Britain and Spain. Sea travellers frequently stopped over at Roatán and the other islands as resting points. On several occasions, the islands were subject to military occupation. In contesting with the Spanish for colonisation of the Caribbean, the English occupied the Bay Islands on and off between 1550 and 1700. During this time, buccaneers found the vacated, mostly unprotected islands a haven for safe harbour and transport. English, French and Dutch pirates established settlements on the islands. They frequently raided the Spanish treasure ships, cargo vessels carrying gold and silver from the New World to Spain. In 1722 fisherman Philip Ashton was captured by the pirate Edward Low and managed to escape on a watering rendezvous on Roatan. His noted account of his subsequent year spent on the uninhabited island provides a glimpse of the island after the eradication of the Paya and before colonisation.

During the War of the Austrian Succession, a British Army detachment under the command of John Caulfield garrisoned the island from 1742 to 1749. The garrison originally consisted of two companies of Gooch&#x27;s American Regiment, but these were eventually amalgamated into the 49th Regiment of Foot (later amalgamated as part of the Cardwell Reforms into the Royal Berkshire Regiment).

In 1797, the British defeated the Garifuna, who had been supported by the French, in a conflict for control of the Windward Caribbean island of St. Vincent as part of the Second Carib War. The British then deported the Garifuna to Roatán. The majority of the Garifuna migrated to Trujillo on mainland Honduras, but a portion remained to found the community of &quot;Punta Gorda&quot; on the northern coast of Roatán. The Garifuna, whose ancestry includes Arawak and Maroons, remained in Punta Gorda, becoming the Bay Island&#x27;s first permanent post-Columbian settlers. They also migrated from there to parts of the northern coast of Central America, becoming the foundation of the modern-day &quot;Garífuna&quot; culture in Honduras, Belize and Guatemala.

The majority permanent population of Roatán originated from the Cayman Islands. They arrived in the 1830s shortly after the passage of the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act; the changes in the labour system disrupted the economic structure of the Caymans. The islands had a largely seafaring culture; natives were familiar with the area from turtle fishing and other activities. Former slaveholders from the Cayman Islands were among the first to settle in the seaside locations throughout primarily western Roatán. During the late 1830s and 1840s, former slaves also migrated from the Cayman Islands, in larger number than planters. All together, the former Cayman peoples became the largest cultural group on the island.

For a brief period in the 1850s, Britain declared the Bay Islands its colony. Within a decade, the Crown ceded the territory formally back to Honduras. British colonists were sent to compete for control. They asked American William Walker, a freebooter (filibuster) with a private army, to help end the crisis in 1860 by establishing an independent, English-speaking government over the islands; he eventually fell into the custody of the Honduran government, which executed him.

In the 20th century, there was continued population growth resulting in increased economic changes and environmental challenges. A population boom began with an influx of Spanish-speaking Mestizo migrants from the Honduran mainland. Since the late 20th century, they tripled the previous resident population. Mestizo migrants settled primarily in the urban areas of Coxen Hole and Barrio Los Fuertes (near French Harbour). Even the mainlander influx was dwarfed in number and economic effects by the overwhelming tourist presence in the 21st century. Numerous American, Canadian, British, New Zealander, Australian and South African settlers and entrepreneurs engaged chiefly in the fishing industry. Later, the diving industry, provided the foundation for attracting the tourist trade.

In 1998, Roatán suffered some damage from Hurricane Mitch, temporarily paralysing most commercial activity. The storm also broke up the popular dive-wrecks &quot;Aguila&quot; and &quot;Odyssey.&quot;

== Demographics ==

At the time of the 2013 Honduras census, Roatán municipality had a population of 41,831. Of these, 52.06% were Mestizo, 20.97% Black or Afro-Honduran, 12.41% White, 11.19% Indigenous (3.73% Chʼortiʼ, 3.49% Lenca, 1.26% Miskito, 1.07% Pech) and 3.37% others.

===Islanders===
The English-speaking people who have been established in Northern Honduras (specifically, the Bay Islands) since the early 19th century are chiefly of European and British-Afro-Caribbean descent and are called &quot;Islanders&quot; or &quot;caracoles&quot; (snails). They are called &quot;caracoles&quot; by Spanish-Speaking Hondurans, a term deemed offensive by native Islanders who have a long-standing rivalry with Spanish-speaking Hondurans because of their differences in culture, language, beliefs and ideals. The region of the Bay Islands encompasses the three major islands of Roatán, Útila and Guanaja, the Hog Islands, as well as the smaller islands or cays. These people are also called &quot;Islanders&quot;, especially locally.

English is the first language of native islanders, regardless of race, and Spanish is spoken second, whereas mainland Honduras is Spanish-speaking. It remains this way because of the islands&#x27; history as a British colony with some islanders claiming descent from the British Isles. With the steady influx of mainland Hondurans migrating to the islands in the late twentieth century, Spanish language use has increased. However, because of the tourism and cruise ship industry that supports the economy of the islands, English continues to be the first spoken and dominant language among all native island peoples.

Over time, the form of English spoken by the Roatán Islanders has changed. The language differs mostly in morphology but also in pronunciation and accent and, to a lesser extent, in syntax and vocabulary, from the English spoken in other regions of the Commonwealth Caribbean, as evidenced by the usage of a wide variety of old standard English terms and words throughout the islands. They are similar enough to be mutually intelligible and understood throughout the entire Bay Islands. The language can also be learned, although it is not taught in the general sense, whilst the accent derives from the wide variety of expatriates living and working on the Islands from North America and Europe.

==Environment==
Roatán lies on the southern edge of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the second-largest barrier reef in the world. Reef systems are very delicate and have experienced massive damage and degradation worldwide. On Roatán, unchecked tourism development and an increased population are putting a strain on its natural resources. Deforestation, run-off, poorly managed waste treatment, and pollution are the main threats to the terrestrial and marine environments.

The city of Coxen Hole underwent a major reconstruction between the years of 2003 to 2005 adding new black water and septic lines as well as fresh water lines to accommodate the growing business sector and population. These lines are used in conjunction with the new water treatment plant and a waste management plant that recycles waste which are adjacent to the Roatán International Airport.

A similar project has been completed and now serving West End Village (the Island&#x27;s tourism, social and diving hub) with even greater success than its predecessors. Although the project was initially met with some skepticism and anger at a tax hike proposed to help fund the project, it has turned out to be an overwhelming success with a new state of the art road, pumping station, sewer lines and drainage system. The project and its facilities are currently maintained and operated by ACME sanitation and solutions. It was not that long ago where &quot;sanitation&quot; was provided by hundreds of out-houses located at the ends of short boardwalks over the water. In the smaller communities, this &quot;system&quot; may still be in use. The Island has also expanded, repaved and revamped both its major highway roads with the south and north side portions being completed by mid-2020.

The Roatán Marine Park was the main force behind introducing recycling to the Island as well as the popular &quot;Coastal clean up&quot; projects that have become very popular among schools, residents and expatriate communities on the Island. The Marine Park is led by a team of professional divers, marine biologists and oceanographers. In 2019 the local government passed a law banning the use and sale of plastic bags, bottles, containers and styrofoam. The Island expects to continue passing comprehensive environmental and pollution reforms through 2020 and beyond.

===Important Bird Area===
The island is part of the Islas de la Bahía y Cayos Cochinos Important Bird Area (IBA), designated as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of white-crowned pigeons, chimney swifts and yellow-naped amazons.

===Roatán Marine Park===
The Roatán Marine Park (RMP) is a grassroots, community-based, non-profit organization located on Roatán. The organization was formed in January 2005 when a group of concerned dive operators and local businesses united in an effort to protect Roatán&#x27;s fragile coral reefs. Initially, the RMP&#x27;s goal was to run a patrol program within the Sandy Bay-West End Marine Reserve (SBWEMR), to prevent over exploitation through unsustainable fishing practices. Over time, the organisation expanded the scope of their environmental efforts through the addition of other programs to protect Roatán&#x27;s natural resources, including patrols and infrastructure, education, conservation and public awareness.

The East End Chapter of the Roatan Marine Park was created in late 2017 in an effort to expand the RMP&#x27;s efforts across the entire island. The initiative and volunteer efforts saw an increase in fish coverage and a 200% increase in turtle nesting for the 2019 season, and new goals include expanding education outreach and local alternative livelihood programs.

===Roatan Institute of Marine Science===
The Roatan Institute for Marine Sciences (RIMS) was established in 1989 with the primary objective being the preservation of Roatán&#x27;s natural resources through education and research. RIMS is located in Sandy Bay, specifically in Anthony&#x27;s Key Resort, on the northwest coast of Roatán with over of fringing and barrier reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, and shoreline. Over the past twenty five years, RIMS has established itself as a teaching institution and is visited by colleges as well as universities from abroad to study nearby tropical marine ecosystems and the bottlenose dolphins kept by the facility.

===Conservation===
All reef systems throughout the Bay Islands are protected by the local and central government with help from charitable donations and those on the front line. Through local donations to the Marine Park and the many causes along with a concerted effort from the resorts on the island weekly clean-ups are undertaken to insure no metals or plastics litter the reef system and beaches as well as all major dive shops doing clean-ups on most of their daily dives. There are still obstacles to be defeated but the Islanders and expatriates living on the islands have taken a united stand to conserve and educate.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
The Juan Manuel Gálvez International Airport (RTB) on Roatán is one of four airports able to receive international traffic that is in service in Honduras. The other airports in Honduras are the Ramon Villeda Morales International Airport (SAP) in San Pedro Sula, Toncontin International Airport (TGU) in Tegucigalpa, Goloson International Airport in La Ceiba (LCE), and Palmerola International Airport (XPL), in Comayagua.

The island of Roatán airport has a terminal that is served with nonstop international flights to Roatán from Houston, Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Miami, Denver, and San Salvador. Regional flights also operate to Puerto Lempira (PEU), Tegucigalpa (TGU), and San Pedro Sula (SAP). During the winter months, the island also receives international flights from Canadian-based airline, Sunwing Airlines, which operates flights to Montreal, Quebec City, and Toronto from mid November to mid April. Minnesota-based Sun Country Airlines also flies to Minneapolis from Roatan. WestJet started operations to the island in 2019.The island formerly had service to Milan, Italy, operated by Air Italy.

===Port===
The ferry &quot;Galaxy Wave&quot; provides service from Roatán to La Ceiba twice daily. The ferry &quot;Utila Dream&quot; provides service from Roatán to Utila to La Ceiba twice daily.

==Economic zone==
Roatán contains a special economic zone &quot;Zona de Empleo y de Desarrollo Económico&quot; (ZEDE) or Zone for Economic Development and Employment, designated by Honduran constitutional provisions and legislation. The goal is to enable stable legal structures, physical environment, human rights, and taxation in order to encourage investment, migration, and economic development. This is the location of the private charter city of Próspera.

<text>Paul Carl Kocher (born June 11, 1973) is an American cryptographer and cryptography entrepreneur who founded Cryptography Research, Inc. (CRI) and served as its president and chief scientist.

==Education and early life==

Kocher grew up in Oregon. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology from Stanford University in 1995, where he worked part-time with Martin Hellman. According to Hellman, Kocher is mostly self-taught in cryptography and already knew an amazing amount when they first met in Kocher&#x27;s sophomore year. As demand for Kocher&#x27;s knowledge in cryptography escalated, he gave up on his original plan to become a veterinarian and founded CRI instead.

==Career and research==

Kocher was awarded the 2019 Marconi Prize with Taher Elgamal for architecting the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0/Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 protocol, a cryptographic protocol for secure communications on the Internet.

He pioneered the field of side-channel attacks, including the development of timing attacks that can break implementations of RSA, DSA and fixed-exponent Diffie–Hellman that operate in non-constant time, as well as the co-development of power analysis and differential power analysis. His side-channel attack countermeasure designs are widely deployed in secure integrated circuits and other cryptographic devices. He has also worked on microprocessor security, and co-discovered and named the spectre vulnerability, which leverages speculative execution and other microprocessor performance optimizations to extract confidential information.

He also helped architect security-related integrated circuits, including Deep Crack, a DES brute-force key search machine.

==Honors and awards==
Kocher was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering in 2009 for his contributions to cryptography and Internet security. He serves on the National Academies&#x27; Forum on Cyber Resilience.

In 2018, Kocher was named a Fellow of the International Association for Cryptologic Research for &quot;fundamental contributions to the study of side-channel attacks and countermeasures, cryptography in practice, and for service to the IACR.&quot;

Kocher and Taher Elgamal were jointly awarded the 2019 Marconi Prize for &quot;their development of SSL/TLS and other contributions to the security of communications&quot;.

Kocher was awarded the 2023 Levchin Prize for &quot;pioneering work on side channel analysis.&quot;

<text>Milton La Salle Humason (August 19, 1891 – June 18, 1972) was an American astronomer. He worked with Edwin Hubble to measure the redshift of nebulas in the early 20th century, providing evidence of the expansion of the universe.

== Biography ==

Milton Humason was born in Dodge Center, Minnesota.

Humason dropped out of school and had no formal education past the age of 14. Because he loved the mountains, and Mount Wilson in particular, he became a &quot;mule skinner&quot; taking materials and equipment up the mountain while Mount Wilson Observatory was being built. In 1917, after a short stint on a ranch in La Verne, he became a janitor at the observatory. Out of sheer interest, he volunteered to be a night assistant at the observatory. His technical skill and quiet manner made him a favorite on the mountain. Recognizing his talent, in 1919, George Ellery Hale made him a Mt. Wilson staff member. This was unprecedented, as Humason did not have a Ph.D., or even a high school diploma. He soon proved Hale&#x27;s judgment correct, as he made several key observational discoveries. He became known as a meticulous observer, obtaining photographs and difficult spectrograms of faint galaxies. His observations played a major role in the development of physical cosmology, including assisting Edwin Hubble in formulating Hubble&#x27;s law. In 1950 he earned a D.Sc. from Lund University. He retired in 1957.

He discovered Comet C/1961 R1 (Humason), notable for its large perihelion distance.

Due to merest chance, Humason missed discovering Pluto. Eleven years before Clyde Tombaugh, Humason took a set of four photographs in which the image of Pluto appeared. There is persistent speculation that he missed discovering the dwarf planet because it fell on a defect in the photographic plate. This is unlikely, however, given that it appeared in four separate photographs over three different nights.

Much of the work Humason performed was actually credited to Hubble, the two of whom worked together for many years.

He died in Mendocino, California.

==In popular culture==
In the popular documentary &quot;&quot; by astronomer Carl Sagan, Humason&#x27;s life and work are portrayed on screen in episode 10: &quot;The Edge of Forever.&quot;

Humason was also the inspiration for the Big Dipper song &quot;Humason,&quot; which appeared on the Boston group&#x27;s 1987 album Heavens.

==Honors==
* The crater Humason on the Moon is named after him as are &quot;Humason-Zwicky stars&quot;.

<doc id="808655" wikidata="Q1970212" url="?curid=808655" title="Tag question">
<text>A tag question is a construction in which an interrogative element is added to a declarative or an imperative clause. The resulting speech act comprises an assertion paired with a request for confirmation. For instance, the English tag question &quot;You&#x27;re John, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; consists of the declarative clause &quot;You&#x27;re John&quot; and the interrogative tag &quot;aren&#x27;t you?&quot;

==Uses==
In most languages, tag questions are more common in spoken usage than in formal written usage. They can be an indicator of politeness, hedging, consensus seeking, emphasis and irony. They may suggest confidence or lack of confidence; they may be confrontational, defensive or tentative. Although they have the grammatical form of a question, they may be rhetorical (not expecting an answer). In other cases, when they do expect a response, they may differ from straightforward questions in that they cue the listener as to what response is desired. In legal settings, tag questions can often be found in a leading question. According to a specialist children&#x27;s lawyer at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), children find it difficult to answer tag questions other than in accordance with the expectation of the questioner using or tagging a question.

==Forms==
Question tags are formed in several ways, and many languages give a choice of formation. In some languages the most common is a single word or fixed phrase, whereas in others it is formed by a regular grammatical construction.

===Single word forms===

In many languages, the question tag is a simple positive or negative. Russian allows &quot;да?&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;) whereas Spanish and Italian use &quot;¿no?&quot; and &quot;no?&quot; respectively. In Indonesian, sometimes &quot;ya?&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;) is used but it is more common to say &quot;kan?&quot;, which probably is a contraction of &quot;bukan&quot; (negation for nouns).

Another common formation is comparable to the English &quot;correct?&quot; or the informal form &quot;right?&quot;, though more often realised as the word for &quot;true&quot; or &quot;truth&quot;, in fact, such as in Polish &quot;prawda?&quot;, Slovak &quot;pravda?&quot; or the particle &quot;však?&quot;, or Spanish &quot;¿verdad?&quot;, which in turn can be presented in a negative form (&quot;not true?&quot;), such as in the Russian &quot;не правда ли?&quot;, German &quot;nicht wahr?&quot; Lithuanian &quot;ar ne?&quot;, or Latin &quot;nonne?&quot;

A plain conjunction may be used, such as the Czech and Slovak &quot;že?&quot; (&quot;that&quot;). 
Various other words occur in specific languages, such as German &quot;oder?&quot; (&quot;or&quot;), Slovak &quot;či?&quot; (&quot;or&quot;, colloquialism), and the Mandarin Chinese 吗 &quot;ma&quot; (a question denominator, used as a modal particle to denote questions - untranslatable).

Another pattern is to combine affirmation and negation, as can be done in Chinese, for example as &quot;duì bù duì&quot; (&quot;Correct or not?&quot;); or Vietnamese &quot;đúng không? (Correct, no?).&quot;

Some languages have words whose only function is as a question tag. In Scots and certain dialects of English, &quot;eh?&quot; functions this way. French has &quot;hein?&quot;, Southern German dialects have &quot;gell?&quot; (derived from a verb meaning &quot;to be valid&quot;) and Brazilian Portuguese has &quot;né?&quot; (actually a colloquial contraction of &quot;não é&quot;, literally &quot;isn&#x27;t it&quot;, while &quot;é?&quot;, pronounced much like English &quot;eh?&quot;, would have a different intended meaning, that of English &quot;right?&quot;), Hungarian uses &quot;ugye?&quot;.

===Grammatically regular forms===
In several languages, the tag question is built around the standard interrogative form. In English and the Celtic languages, this interrogative agrees with the verb in the main clause, whereas in other languages the structure has fossilised into a fixed form, such as the French &quot;n&#x27;est-ce pas ?&quot; (literally &quot;isn&#x27;t it?&quot;).

====Grammatically productive tag forms====
Grammatically productive tag forms are formed in the same way as simple questions, referring back to the verb in the main clause and agreeing in time and person (where the language has such agreement). The tag may include a pronoun, such as in English, or may not, as is the case in Scottish Gaelic. If the rules of forming interrogatives require it, the verb in the tag may be an auxiliary, as in English.

===Punctuation===
In most languages, a tag question is set off from the sentence by a comma ⟨,⟩.
In Spanish, where the beginnings of questions are marked with an inverted question mark, it is only the tag, not the whole sentence, which is placed within the question bracket:
*&quot;Estás cansado, ¿verdad?&quot; (You&#x27;re tired, aren&#x27;t you?).

==In English==

English tag questions, when they have the grammatical form of a question, are atypically complex, because they vary according to at least three factors: the choice of auxiliary, the negation and the intonation pattern. This is unique among the Germanic languages, but the Celtic languages operate in a very similar way. For the theory that English has borrowed its system of tag questions from Brittonic, see Brittonicisms in English.

===Auxiliary===

The English tag question is made up of an auxiliary verb and a pronoun. The auxiliary must agree with the tense, aspect and modality of the verb in the preceding sentence. If the verb is in the present perfect, for example, the tag question uses &quot;has&quot; or &quot;have&quot;; if the verb is in a present progressive form, the tag is formed with &quot;am, are, is&quot;; if the verb is in a tense which does not normally use an auxiliary, like the present simple, the auxiliary is taken from the emphatic &quot;do&quot; form; and if the sentence has a modal auxiliary, this is echoed in the tag:

* &quot;He has read this book, hasn&#x27;t he?&quot;
* &quot;He read this book, didn&#x27;t he?&quot;
* &quot;He&#x27;s reading this book, isn&#x27;t he?&quot;
* &quot;He reads a lot of books, doesn&#x27;t he?&quot;
* &quot;He&#x27;ll read this book, won&#x27;t he?&quot;
* &quot;He should read this book, shouldn&#x27;t he?&quot;
* &quot;He can read this book, can&#x27;t he?&quot;
* &quot;He&#x27;d read this book, wouldn&#x27;t he?&quot;
* &quot;He&#x27;d read this book, hadn&#x27;t he?&quot;

A special case occurs when the main verb is &quot;to be&quot; in a simple tense. Here the tag question repeats the main verb, not an auxiliary:

* &quot;This is a book, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;

===Balanced and unbalanced tags===

English question tags exist in both positive and negative forms. When there is no special emphasis, the rule of thumb often applies that a positive sentence has a negative tag and vice versa. This form may express confidence, or seek confirmation of the asker&#x27;s opinion or belief.
* &quot;She is French, isn&#x27;t she?&quot;
* &quot;She&#x27;s not French, is she?&quot;
These are referred to as &quot;balanced tag questions&quot;.

&quot;Unbalanced tag questions&quot; feature a positive statement with a positive tag, or a negative statement with a negative tag; it has been estimated that in normal conversation, as many as 40–50% of tags are unbalanced. Unbalanced tag questions may be used for ironic or confrontational effects:
* &quot;Do listen, will you?&quot;
* &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m lazy, am I?&quot;
* Jack: &quot;I refuse to spend Sunday at your mother&#x27;s house!&quot; Jill: &quot;Oh you do, do you? We&#x27;ll see about that!&quot;
* &quot;Oh! Making a stand, are we?&quot;

Unbalanced tags are also used for guessing, or for a suggestion with &quot;let&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;shall&quot;. In particular, &quot;let&#x27;s&quot; is always used with the positive unbalanced form:
* &quot;You have talked him into this, have you?&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;ll make tea, shall I?&quot;
* &quot;Let&#x27;s start, shall we?&quot; 

Patterns of negation can show regional variations. In North East Scotland, for example, positive to positive is used when no special effect is desired:
* &quot;This pizza&#x27;s fine, is it? (standard English: &quot;This pizza&#x27;s delicious, isn&#x27;t it?)

Note the following variations in the negation when the auxiliary is the &quot;I&quot; form of the copula:
* Standard/formal: &quot;Clever, am I not?&quot;
* England (and America, Australia, etc.): &quot;Clever, aren&#x27;t I?&quot;
* Scotland/Northern Ireland: &quot;Clever, amn&#x27;t I?&quot;
* nonstandard dialects: &quot;Clever, ain&#x27;t I?&quot;

===Intonation===

English tag questions can have a rising or a falling intonation pattern. This can be contrasted with Polish, French or German, for example, where all tags rise, or with the Celtic languages, where all fall. As a rule, the English rising pattern is used when soliciting information or motivating an action, that is, when some sort of response is required. Since normal English yes/no questions have rising patterns (e.g. &quot;Are you coming?&quot;), these tags make a grammatical statement into a real question:
*&quot;You&#x27;re coming, aren&#x27;t you?&quot;
*&quot;Do listen, will you?&quot;
*&quot;Let&#x27;s have a beer, shall we?&quot;
The falling pattern is used to underline a statement. The statement itself ends with a falling pattern, and the tag sounds like an echo, strengthening the pattern. Most English tag questions have this falling pattern.
*&quot;He doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing, does he?&quot;
*&quot;This is really boring, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;
Sometimes the rising tag goes with the positive to positive pattern to create a confrontational effect:
*&quot;He was the best in the class, was he?&quot; (rising: the speaker is challenging this thesis, or perhaps expressing surprised interest)
*&quot;He was the best in the class, wasn&#x27;t he?&quot; (falling: the speaker holds this opinion)
*&quot;Be careful, will you?&quot; (rising: expresses irritation)
*&quot;Take care, won&#x27;t you?&quot; (falling: expresses concern)
Sometimes the same words may have different patterns depending on the situation or implication.
*&quot;You don&#x27;t remember my name, do you?&quot; (rising: expresses surprise)
*&quot;You don&#x27;t remember my name, do you?&quot; (falling: expresses amusement or resignation)
*&quot;Your name&#x27;s Mary, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; (rising: expresses uncertainty)
*&quot;Your name&#x27;s Mary, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; (falling: expresses confidence)
As an all-purpose tag the Multicultural London English set-phrase &quot;innit&quot; (for &quot;isn&#x27;t it&quot;) is only used with falling patterns:
*&quot;He doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing, innit?&quot;
*&quot;He was the best in the class, innit?&quot;
On the other hand, the adverbial tag questions (&quot;alright? OK?&quot; etc.) are almost always found with rising patterns. An occasional exception is &quot;surely&quot;.

===Other forms===
Besides the standard form based on auxiliary verbs, there are other forms specific to particular regions or dialects of English. These are generally invariant, regardless of verb, person or negativity.

The tag &quot;right?&quot; is common in a number of dialects across the UK and US, as well as in Indian English. It is an example of an invariable tag which is preferred in American English over traditional tags.

The tags &quot;isn&#x27;t it?&quot; and &quot;no?&quot; are used in Indian English.

The tag &quot;eh?&quot; is of Scottish origin, and can be heard across much of Scotland, New Zealand, Canada and the North-Eastern United States. In Central Scotland (in and around Stirling and Falkirk), this exists in the form &quot;eh no?&quot; which is again invariant.

The conjunction &quot;or?&quot; is also used to make yes/no-questions less imposing. These questions frequently formulate a candidate understanding and signal that the bias towards a confirming answer is weaker, while opening up for an elaboration to the answer. Examples:
* Does that bring up jealousy for you or?
* Is he in good spirits or?

The tag &quot;hey?&quot; (of Afrikaans and Dutch origin) is used in South African English.

==In Celtic languages==
Like English, the Celtic languages form tag questions by echoing the verb of the main sentence. The Goidelic languages, however, make little or no use of auxiliary verbs, so that it is generally the main verb itself which reappears in the tag. As in English, the tendency is to have a negative tag after a positive sentence and vice versa, but unbalanced tags are also possible. Some examples from Scottish Gaelic:

(Here, &quot;eil&quot; and &quot;fhaca&quot; are dependent forms of the irregular verbs &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;chunnaic&quot;.)

* &quot;Is toil leat fìon, nach toil?&quot; – You like wine, don&#x27;t you?
* &quot;Tha i brèagha an diugh, nach eil?&quot; – It&#x27;s nice today, isn&#x27;t it?
* &quot;Chunnaic mi e, nach fhaca?&quot; – I saw him, didn&#x27;t I?
* &quot;Thèid mi ga dhùsgadh, an tèid?&quot; – I&#x27;ll go and wake him, shall I? (unbalanced!)

In Welsh, a special particle &quot;on&quot; is used to introduce tag questions, which are then followed by the inflected form of a verb. Unlike English and the Goidelic languages, Welsh prefers a positive tag after a positive statement, and negative after negative. With the auxiliary &quot;bod&quot;, it is the inflected form of &quot;bod&quot; that is used:

* &quot;Mae hi&#x27;n bwrw glaw heddiw, on dydy?&quot; – It&#x27;s raining today, isn&#x27;t it?
* &quot;Dydy hi ddim yn bwrw glaw heddiw, on nac ydy?&quot; – It&#x27;s not raining today, is it?

With inflected non-preterite forms, the inflected form of the verb is used:

* &quot;Doi di yfory, on doi?&quot; – You&#x27;ll come tomorrow, won&#x27;t you?

With preterite and perfect forms, the invariable &quot;do&quot; (also the affirmative answer to these questions) is used:

* &quot;Canodd y bobl, on do?&quot; – The people sang, didn&#x27;t they?
* &quot;Mae hi wedi ei weld o, on do?&quot; – She&#x27;s seen him, hasn&#x27;t she?

When a non-verbal element is being questioned, the question particle &quot;ai&quot; is used:

* &quot;Mr Jones, on dai?&quot; – Mr Jones, isn&#x27;t it? or &quot;Mr Jones, on tefe?&quot;

==In French==
Question tags are not very common in French.

The structure &quot;n&#x27;est-ce pas?&quot; (literally &quot;isn&#x27;t it?&quot;, more idiomatically glossed to English as &quot;isn&#x27;t it true?&quot;) is nowadays considered very formal or obsolete. Unlike in English, the question tag &quot;n&#x27;est-ce pas?&quot; can be used after any subject and verb.

* French: &quot;Vous venez ce soir, n&#x27;est-ce pas?&quot;
** Literally: &quot;You are coming tonight, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; 
** English: &quot;You are coming tonight, aren&#x27;t you?&quot;
* French: &quot;Elle est en France, n&#x27;est-ce pas?&quot;
** Literally: &quot;She is in France, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; 
** English: &quot;She is in France, isn&#x27;t she?&quot;
* French: &quot;Tu n&#x27;es pas venu, n&#x27;est-ce pas?&quot;
** Literally: &quot;You didn&#x27;t come, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; 
** English: &quot;You didn&#x27;t come, did you?&quot;

A more common and formal question tag consists in putting a &quot;non?&quot; (&quot;no?&quot;) at the end of a positive sentence or a &quot;si?&quot; (&quot;yes? with a negative sentence&quot;) at the end of a negative sentence. This structure is also sometimes used by native French speakers with a basic level of English.

* French: &quot;Il y a des taxis, non?&quot;
** Literally: &quot;There are taxis, no?&quot; 
** English: &quot;There are taxis, aren&#x27;t there?&quot;
* French: &quot;Je vais pas rater mon vol, si?&quot;
** Literally: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to miss my flight, yes?&quot; 
** English: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to miss my flight, am I?&quot;

<doc id="808692" wikidata="Q1395208" url="?curid=808692" title="Silvio Santos">
<text>Senor Abravanel (; 12 December 1930 – 17 August 2024), known professionally as Silvio Santos, was a Brazilian television presenter and business magnate. Widely regarded as the greatest personality in Brazilian television, he was the founder of the television network Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão (SBT) and the conglomerate Grupo Silvio Santos, which holds interests in media and real estate among other assets. Throughout his life, he was also involved in other areas such as music and politics. His net worth was estimated at $1.3 billion in 2013, making him the only Brazilian celebrity on &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; billionaires list.

Born in Lapa, Rio de Janeiro, the former capital city of Brazil and former headquarters of the Federal District, Abravanel was the eldest son of a couple of Sephardic Jews who migrated to Brazil in 1924, Alberto Abravanel and Rebeca Caro. Working as a hawker, salesman, and also on the radio, Abravanel debuted on television in the early 1960s as the host of the variety show &quot;Vamos Brincar de Forca&quot; on TV Paulista (now part of TV Globo), adopting the stage name &quot;Silvio Santos&quot;. In 1963, he began hosting &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot;, which would become one of the longest-running programs on Brazilian television. 

In 1976, amid creative conflicts with Globo executives, Silvio entered the broadcasting industry himself by launching a new television station in Rio known as TVS, and purchasing a 50% stake in Rede Record, moving &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; to the two outlets and Rede Tupi. When Tupi was closed by Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship, Silvio&#x27;s company acquired several of the former network&#x27;s licenses, and joined with TVS to form a new national network known as SBT; the network would target lower middle class and working class viewers.

In September 2022, Silvio began to gradually reduce his involvement in television by retiring as host of &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; (being succeeded by his daughter Patricia Abravanel), and stepping down as vice president of SBT in 2023. In July 2024, he was hospitalized with H1N1 and was discharged two days later. After being hospitalized again with the same disease, he died of bronchopneumonia on 17 August 2024, at the age of 93, Silvio was buried on the morning of 18 August, at the Butantã Israelite Cemetery, in São Paulo.

Silvio had six daughters, fourteen grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. In his first marriage, to Maria Aparecida Vieira, most known as Cidinha, he had his first two daughters, Cintia (mother of actor Tiago Abravanel) and Silvia. The couple was together until 1977 when Cidinha died of cancer. Santos married for the second time to Íris Abravanel in 1981, with whom he remained until the end of his life and had four other daughters, Daniela, Patricia, Rebeca and Renata. Santos received several awards and honors, including almost thirty Imprensa trophies, sixteen Internet trophies and ten Roquette Pinto trophies, in addition to being honored with the Order of Merit for Communication by former president Dilma Rousseff and honored by carnival blocks.

== Early life ==
Abravanel was the son of Sephardic Jewish immigrants born in the Ottoman Empire. His father, Alberto Abravanel, was born in Thessaloniki, Greece in 1897 whilst his mother, Rebecca Caro, was born in Smyrna, Turkey in 1905. Both died in Rio de Janeiro (in 1975 and 1988 respectively) and are buried side by side in the Caju Jewish Cemetery, Rio de Janeiro. He was a descendant of Isaac Abrabanel, a 15th-century Portuguese Jewish statesman. Abravanel attended primary school at the Escola Municipal Celestino da Silva, and graduated from Colégio Estadual Amaro Cavalcanti.

Abravanel worked on the streets of Rio de Janeiro as a street vendor at the age of 14, selling plastic cases for storing voter registration cards. Impressed by his voice, he was invited to try out for a position at Radio Guanabara, but quit after a month because he made more money as a street vendor. At the age of 18, he began service in the Brazilian Army, training as part of the Paratroopers Brigade.

== Broadcasting career ==
As he had time off on Sundays, Abravanel revisited his pursuit of a broadcasting career by joining Rádio Mauá. He later moved to Rádio Tupi, and added another position at Rádio Continental in Niterói—to which he travelled by ferry from Rio. Seeing an opportunity in adding entertainment for passengers, he began a business venture of bringing a PA system aboard the ferry to play music and commercials. Abravanel quit Rádio Continental to focus on the ferry venture instead, which proved successful. After the ferry company added bars to the ships, Santos spearheaded raffle promotions where passengers could receive a ticket by buying a beverage.

Abravanel adopted the professional name Silvio Santos; his mother Caro had taken to calling him &quot;Silvio&quot; instead of &quot;Senor&quot; as it was easier to pronounce, while his surname stemmed from having once said &quot;que todos os Santos me ajudem&quot; (&quot;may all the Saints help me&quot;) before going on the air.

=== Baú da Felicidade, television work ===

Santos would later move to São Paulo, taking a job at Rádio Nacional de São Paulo, and beginning other ventures such as a magazine, and a circus caravan—where he would continue a focus on raffles as an aspect of his businesses. One of the advertisers Santos would work with at the station was Manuel de Nóbrega, entertainer and co-owner of Baú da Felicidade—a company that offered Christmas toy chests that customers could pay for in installments throughout the year. However, after the company faced financial issues (including Manuel&#x27;s German partner taking the money for himself, the company being unable to deliver on its orders, and its &quot;headquarters&quot; being a largely empty basement), Manuel transferred the business to Santos—who would go on to establish a partnership with the Estrela toy company, and expand the program by allowing customers to redeem for other items besides toys.

In 1960, TV Paulista signed Santos to host a television program—&quot;Vamos Brincar de Forca&quot;—which would incorporate variety entertainment and raffles, and be used to promote Baú da Felicidade. He would also go on to host other programs for TV Tupi. In 1963, he moved to a Sunday afternoon variety show on TV Paulista, &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot;. In 1966, TV Paulista became part of the new Rede Globo, which signed Santos to a five-year deal. In 1971, Santos began to present the Troféu Imprensa, an awards presentation for Brazilian television. He opened a studio, Estudios Silvio Santos Cinema e Televisao, at the former facilities of TV Excelsior in 1974.

=== TVS and SBT ===
In the early-1970s, Rede Globo began to shift its programming strategy in order to help improve viewership, with a stronger focus on telenovelas, news, sports, and films. As his variety programming conflicted with these new policies, Santos&#x27; relationship with Globo executives began to falter, and he almost left the network in 1972. Santos sought to establish his own channel, but his contract with Globo prevented him from holding ownership stakes in a competitor. In the interim, Santos had a partner—Dermerval Gonçalves—covertly offer to acquire a stake in TV Record on his behalf to keep his programming on the air in São Paulo.

When the Brazilian government began taking applications for a new VHF station in Rio on channel 11, Santos would bid for its concession with the support of Manuel de Nóbrega and other television personalities (including Carlos Eduardo Imperial, who had previously been critical of Santos&#x27;s programming). Santos would be awarded the concession for channel 11 in December 1975, becoming the first Brazilian television artist to own a broadcast station.

To get the station on air as quickly as possible, Santos purchased transmission equipment formerly used by TV Continental (which had closed in 1971) at auction; initially dismissed as junk by the press, it was discovered that all of the equipment was in working order, and capable of broadcasting in colour (with its use by Continental pre-dating the official introduction of PAL-M colour television in 1972). The new station—known as TVS—first broadcast on 14 May 1976. &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; would subsequently move from Globo to TVS in August; it would also be simulcast by TV Record (with Santos having completed his purchase of a 50% stake), and Rede Tupi.

In July 1980, Rede Tupi was closed by the military dictatorship, and the federal government began to take bids on its stations&#x27; concessions. Santos was among several parties placing bids, and commissioned a survey from the IBOPE that displayed public support for him as an owner. In 1981, the stations would be awarded to Grupo Silvio Santos and Grupo Bloch, with Santos awarded Tupi&#x27;s former signals in São Paulo and Porto Alegre. His victory in São Paulo was criticized by a local broadcasters&#x27; union, who lamented TVS&#x27;s programming as &quot;canned goods&quot;, and felt that Santos only wanted to sell more Baú da Felicidade cards.

The São Paulo station signed on 19 August 1981, and the Porto Alegre station soon afterward; the two stations and TVS would form a new network known as the Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão (SBT). The new network&#x27;s programming would aim to target a lower middle class and working class audience. Meanwhile, Bloch&#x27;s stations became the core of another new network, Rede Manchete. Santos had also won the concession for a station in Rio; this station would be transferred to Paulinho Machado de Carvalho, and operate as an affiliate of TV Record. By the late-1980s, SBT became more established, acquiring popular film rights, and signing names such as Hebe Camargo, Carlos Alberto de Nóbrega, and Jô Soares. 

In January 1988, Santos traveled to Boston to undergo medical treatment for vocal cord issues that had caused him to lose his voice, and a tumor on one of his eyelids, which was found to be benign. As his spouse Maria Aparecida Vieira had died from cancer in 1977, the 57 year-old Santos had introspections between himself and his colleagues regarding his health and future, leading him to begin the process of naming a successor. During the Rio Carnival the following month, Santos personally intervened with Globo&#x27;s president Roberto Marinho to keep Gugu Liberato—an SBT personality who had been offered a Sunday variety show on Globo—from defecting to the competitor. Santos would give Gugu a larger salary, and prominent hosting roles in SBT&#x27;s Sunday lineup (which would later include his own variety show, &quot;Domingo Legal&quot;).

=== Further projects ===

In 1989, 20 days before the Brazil&#x27;s first direct presidential election since 1960, Santos announced that he would run as a candidate for the Brazilian Municipalist Party. However, the party was delisted from the ballot shortly afterward due to multiple technicalities. Amid financial issues at the broadcaster, agreements were reached to sell Rede Record to Edir Macedo, founder of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.

In 1991, Santos would premiere one of his most popular series, the hidden camera game show &quot;Topa Tudo por Dinheiro.&quot; Adapted from the American series &quot;Anything for Money&quot;, the show would introduce a trademark of Santos throwing paper planes made from banknotes into the studio audience as prizes (a practice that, at one point, drew the ire of the Central Bank of Brazil), and the accompanying catchphrase &quot;Quem quer dinheiro?&quot; (&quot;Who wants money?&quot;).

In 1999, Santos premiered &quot;Show do Milhão&quot;, a game show that was influenced by &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; (which would not have a local version until 2017, hosted by Luciano Huck for Globo) and became a major success for SBT through the early-2000s.

On 28 August 2001, Santos was held hostage in his mansion by Fernando Dutra Pinto, a suspect in the then-recent kidnapping of his daughter Patricia Abravanel. After holding the presenter captive for eight hours, Fernando was later detained by police, and Santos was released, joined by Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin.

In October 2001, Santos entered the reality television market by premiering &quot;Casa dos Artistas&quot;. The show was inspired by the Dutch format &quot;Big Brother&quot;; Santos had attempted to acquire the local rights to the format for SBT, but lost to Globo. The series was developed in secret, and only revealed on its premiere date of 28 October 2001, drawing away viewers from Globo&#x27;s highly-viewed newsmagazine &quot;Fantástico&quot;. Its similarities to &quot;Big Brother&quot; led to Globo (who held local rights to the franchise, but had not yet made any plans to produce a Brazilian version) briefly reaching an injunction to halt its broadcast, but &quot;Casa&quot; would later return to air. The first season was successful, with SBT averaging 46 ratings points, and the success prompting Globo to launch a local adaptation of &quot;Big Brother&quot; to capitalize upon it.

By the 2000s, &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; was primarily structured as a block of multiple Sunday-afternoon programs rather than as a singular variety show, with Santos focusing more on hosting individual programs, particularly on Wednesday nights. In 2008, &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; was revived as a variety show, with Santos reviving classic segments and features.

With a net worth of US$3.2 billion, Santos was the single biggest individual/natural person taxpayer in Brazil.

=== Departure from television work ===
In 2020, &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; went on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with its timeslot filled by compilations of highlights from past episodes of the series and other Silvio Santos programs. In December 2020, the presenter celebrated his 90th birthday privately with his family. In July 2021, &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; briefly returned to filming for the first time since 2020, but was halted again after Santos was infected with COVID-19.

In October 2021, Santos&#x27;s daughter Patricia Abravanel began to serve as a guest host, filling in for Santos. In April 2022, Santos returned to the program for the first time in eight months, marked by an appearance as a surprise opponent for Ratinho in the show&#x27;s &quot;Jogo das Três Pistas&quot; game. However, his return would be brief, as Santos began to steadily reduce his involvement in television work. Santos would step down as host of his eponymous program, with his final episode taped in September 2022 and airing on 26 February 2023; at this time, Patricia took over as the permanent host of &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot;, but Santos would continue to make occasional appearances on the program and other SBT specials.

Santos would also step down from his role as vice president of SBT in April 2023, in favor of his daughter Daniela Beyruti. Despite these moves, Santos did not officially announce his retirement.

== Legacy ==

Due to his extremely charismatic personality, Santos was one of the most influential and beloved people in Brazil, and was considered to be a &quot;timeless&quot; figure of Brazilian entertainment. In an obituary after his death, Argentine newspaper &quot;Clarín&quot; praised Santos&#x27;s skills and self-confidence on-air.

Santos&#x27;s other trademark was wearing a full-size microphone on his chest (although he would eventually abandon this practice in late 2014).

Silvio Santos was portrayed by José Rubens Chachá in the 2022 biographical television series &quot;O Rei da TV&quot;. He was also portrayed by Rodrigo Faro in the 2024 biographical film &quot;Silvio&quot;.

== Death ==

Santos died due to a bronchopneumonia, a complication provoked by H1N1, in São Paulo, on 17 August 2024. He was 93, and had been hospitalized at Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital since the beginning of August 2024.

His body was not veiled and was buried in Israelite Cemetery of Butantã. He did not want tributes or large wakes, which was respected by the family. Because he was Jewish, he was buried, since he could not be cremated.

<doc id="808696" wikidata="Q883520" url="?curid=808696" title="David R. Francis">
<text>David Rowland Francis (October 1, 1850January 15, 1927) was an American politician and diplomat. He served in various positions including Mayor of St. Louis, the 27th Governor of Missouri, and United States Secretary of the Interior. He was the U.S. Ambassador to Russia between 1916 and 1917, during the Russian Revolution of 1917. He was a Wilsonian Democrat.

==Early life==
Francis was born on October 1, 1850, in Richmond, Kentucky, the son of Eliza Caldwell (&quot;née&quot; Rowland) (1830–1898) and John Broaddus Francis (1818–1894). He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 1870 where he was number one on the rolls of the Alpha Iota chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity.

==Career==
After graduating from University, he became a successful businessman in St. Louis and served as the president of a grain merchant&#x27;s exchange. The St. Louis Mining and Stock Exchange was formed in St. Louis in the fall of 1880 with Francis as a founding member.

In 1885, he was elected mayor of St. Louis as a Democrat. In 1888, he was elected governor of Missouri becoming the only mayor of St. Louis elected governor of the state.

In 1896, Francis was appointed United States Secretary of the Interior by President Grover Cleveland and served until 1897.

===World&#x27;s Fair 1904===
Francis was one of the main promoters of the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair of 1904, serving as president of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Historians generally emphasize the prominence of themes of race and empire, and the Fair&#x27;s long-lasting impact on intellectuals in the fields of history, art history, architecture and anthropology. From the point of view of the memory of the average person who attended the fair, it primarily promoted entertainment, consumer goods and popular culture.

The 1904 Summer Olympics were held in combination with that Exposition, and by overseeing the opening ceremony, Francis became the only American to have opened an Olympic Games without ever serving as president or vice president of the United States.

===Later career===
In 1905, after being elected president of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Company, he was sent to Europe by the World&#x27;s Fair directors to thank kings, emperors, and other rulers for their part in making the exposition a success. He was decorated by the emperors of Germany and Austria and Wilhelmina, the Queen of the Netherlands.

In 1910, Francis was arrested for non-payment of taxes, but released on bail.

===Diplomatic career===

President Woodrow Wilson appointed Francis as the last U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Empire between 1916 and 1917. He escaped a communist-organized assassination attempt late in 1916. During Francis&#x27;s time as ambassador, he was almost appointed as U.S. Senator from Missouri. He served in that post during both the social-democratic February Revolution and communist October Revolution of 1917, and through him the U.S. recognized the brief Russian Republic (and not the subsequent Bolshevik regime that seized power in the October Revolution).

Francis was the final owner of the St. Louis Republic, a morning newspaper which he sold after years of losses to the rival St. Louis Globe-Democrat in 1919. His biographer, Harper Barnes, summarized his personality:

David R. Francis was a brash, opinionated, stubborn, smart, sometimes foolish, straight-talking, quick-acting, independent-minded, proud, self-made man who represented the United States in Russia for two and a half years, during the most tumultuous era in that country&#x27;s history. Much of his activity has been shrouded in myth – some of that heroic, more of that comic and tragic.

==Personal life==
On January 20, 1876, he married the former Jane Perry (1854–1924), the daughter of John Dietz Perry (1815–1895) and a granddaughter of James Earickson, the former Missouri State Treasurer. They had six children: John David Perry (1876–1950), David Rowland Jr. (1879–1938), Charles Broaddus (1881–1957), Talton Turner (1882–1955), Thomas (1884–1964), and Sidney Rowland Francis (1888–1960).

His wife died in San Antonio, Texas, on March 21, 1924. Francis died in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 15, 1927. He was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery.

===Legacy===
In 1895, the University of Missouri dedicated David R. Francis Quadrangle in honor of the former governor who is credited with keeping the university in Columbia after the fire of Academic Hall in 1892. Francis insisted that the state&#x27;s land-grant university remain in a central location, rather than moving to Sedalia, as many state legislators desired. Instead, Sedalia was awarded the Missouri State Fair as compensation. A bronze bust of Francis&#x27; face sits at the south end of Francis Quad near the steps of Jesse Hall. A popular MU student tradition is to rub Governor Francis&#x27; nose before taking a test in order to get an A.

The track/soccer/football stadium at Washington University in St. Louis, as well as the adjacent gymnasium, are named in Francis&#x27; honor. Francis Field was the site of the 1904 Summer Olympics; Francis attended the opening ceremony and officially opened the games as the representative for the host nation.

In 1916, he gave of land to the city of St. Louis, Missouri, as a Christmas gift. It was turned into a park that bears his name.

In recognition of his donation of the land, a memorial statue of Francis was installed in Francis Park in the city of St. Louis, Missouri in August 2018. Francis Park is located within the neighborhood of St. Louis Hills. The bronze sculpture of David R. Francis is the work of American artist and sculptor, Harry Weber. The memorial is supported by the group, Friends of Francis Park.

<text>Skin Graft Records (officially capitalized SKiN GRAFT Records) is an independent record label specializing in no wave and noise rock, originally based in Chicago, Illinois. The label is largely responsible for spawning &quot;now wave&quot; genre, an updated version of the late 1970s/early 1980s no wave movement.

==History==
In 1986, SKiN GRAFT was begun by Mark Fischer and Rob Syers as a small-scale publisher of bizarre comic books and fanzines. Some of its comics included &quot;The Kidz&quot; and &quot;Cynicalmanson&quot;.

The label&#x27;s first record was released at the end of 1991. Founder Mark Fischer said of the label in 2000, &quot;Skin Graft is a comic book company that puts out records. &quot; The label&#x27;s mascot is Hot Satan, a simply drawn cartoon devil, usually shown issuing the &quot;heavy metal horns&quot; hand sign.

Bands who have recorded for the label include Dazzling Killmen, Koenjihyakkei, Brise-Glace (featuring Jim O&#x27;Rourke,), Cheer-Accident, The Strangulated Beatoffs, Zeek Sheck, The Chinese Stars, The Flying Luttenbachers, Lake Of Dracula, Gorge Trio, Colossamite, Shorty, U.S. Maple, ZZZZZ, Made In Mexico, Melt-Banana, Quintron, Flossie And The Unicorns, Yona-Kit, You Fantastic!, Ruins, Space Streakings, Zeni Geva, AIDS Wolf, Mount Shasta, Arab On Radar, Yowie, Athletic Automaton, and PRE.

In keeping with the label&#x27;s origins, many SKiN GRAFT musical releases (particularly 7&quot; records and LPs) have included mini comic books as inserts. The label has also used non-traditional packaging with some of their releases. The early vinyl copies of U.S. Maple&#x27;s first album were packaged in metal sheets, and Colossamite&#x27;s 1998 untitled EP came packaged with 5-inch frisbees of varying colors.

From 1994 to 1998, and in 2002, SKiN GRAFT curated the OOPS(!) Fests, featuring many of its bands, along with sideshows and various styles of impromptu performance art.

In the late 1990s, the label purported (as a thinly veiled hoax) that a European record label named SiN RAFT was illegally issuing bootleg copies of SKiN GRAFT releases.

<doc id="808716" wikidata="Q2994918" url="?curid=808716" title="Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant">
<text>In mathematics, the Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant, named for , Axel Thue, and Marston Morse, is the number—denoted by —whose binary expansion 0.01101001100101101001011001101001... is given by the Prouhet–Thue–Morse sequence. That is,
:formula_1
where is the element of the Prouhet–Thue–Morse sequence.

==Other representations==

The Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant can also be expressed, without using , as an infinite product,
:formula_2

This formula is obtained by substituting &quot;x&quot; = 1/2 into generating series for 
:formula_3

The continued fraction expansion of the constant is [0; 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 44, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, …] 

Yann Bugeaud and Martine Queffélec showed that infinitely many partial quotients of this continued fraction are 4 or 5, and infinitely many partial quotients are greater than or equal to 50.

==Transcendence==

The Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant was shown to be transcendental by Kurt Mahler in 1929.

He also showed that the number
:formula_4
is also transcendental for any algebraic number α, where 0 &lt; |&quot;α&quot;| &lt; 1.

Yann Bugaeud proved that the Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant has an irrationality measure of 2.

==Appearances==

The Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant appears in probability. If a language &quot;L&quot; over {0, 1} is chosen at random, by flipping a fair coin to decide whether each word &quot;w&quot; is in &quot;L&quot;, the probability that it contains at least one word for each possible length is 
:formula_5

<text>Vacuum distillation or distillation under reduced pressure is a type of distillation performed under reduced pressure, which allows the purification of compounds not readily distilled at ambient pressures or simply to save time or energy. This technique separates compounds based on differences in their boiling points. This technique is used when the boiling point of the desired compound is &quot;difficult to achieve or will cause the compound to decompose.&quot; Reduced pressures decrease the boiling point of compounds. The reduction in boiling point can be calculated using a temperature-pressure nomograph using the Clausius–Clapeyron relation.

Compounds with a boiling point lower than 150 °C typically are distilled at ambient pressure. For samples with high boiling points, short-path distillation apparatus is commonly employed. This technique is amply illustrated in Organic Synthesis.
===Rotary evaporation===

Rotary evaporation is a common technique used in laboratories to concentrate or isolate a compound from solution. Many solvents are volatile and can easily be evaporated using rotary evaporation. Even less volatile solvents can be removed by rotary evaporation under high vacuum and with heating. It is also used by environmental regulatory agencies for determining the amount of solvents in paints, coatings and inks.

=== Safety considerations ===
Safety is an important consideration when glassware is under vacuum pressure. Scratches and cracks can result in implosions when the vacuum is applied. Wrapping as much of the glassware with tape as is practical helps to prevent dangerous scattering of glass shards in the event of an implosion.

==Industrial-scale applications==

Industrial-scale vacuum distillation has several advantages. Close boiling mixtures may require many equilibrium stages to separate the key components. One tool to reduce the number of stages needed is to utilize vacuum distillation. Vacuum distillation columns (as depicted in Figures 2 and 3) typically used in oil refineries have diameters ranging up to about 14 meters (46 feet), heights ranging up to about 50 meters (164 feet), and feed rates ranging up to about 25,400 cubic meters per day (160,000 barrels per day).

Vacuum distillation can improve a separation by:
* Prevention of product degradation or polymer formation because of reduced pressure leading to lower tower bottoms temperatures,
* Reduction of product degradation or polymer formation because of reduced mean residence time especially in columns using packing rather than trays.
* Increasing yield, and purity.

===Vacuum distillation in petroleum refining===
Petroleum crude oil is a complex mixture of hundreds of different hydrocarbon compounds generally having from 3 to 60 carbon atoms per molecule, although there may be small amounts of hydrocarbons outside that range. The refining of crude oil begins with distilling the incoming crude oil in a so-called &quot;atmospheric distillation column&quot; operating at pressures slightly above atmospheric pressure.

Vacuum distillation can also be referred to as &quot;low-temperature distillation&quot;.

In distilling the crude oil, it is important not to subject the crude oil to temperatures above 370 to 380 °C because high molecular weight components in the crude oil will undergo thermal cracking and form petroleum coke at temperatures above that. Formation of coke would result in plugging the tubes in the furnace that heats the feed stream to the crude oil distillation column. Plugging would also occur in the piping from the furnace to the distillation column as well as in the column itself.

The constraint imposed by limiting the column inlet crude oil to a temperature of less than 370 to 380 °C yields a residual oil from the bottom of the atmospheric distillation column consisting entirely of hydrocarbons that boil above 370 to 380 °C.

To further distill the residual oil from the atmospheric distillation column, the distillation must be performed at absolute pressures as low as 10 to 40 mmHg / Torr (About 5% atmospheric pressure) so as to limit the operating temperature to less than 370 to 380 °C.

Figure 2 is a simplified process diagram of a petroleum refinery vacuum distillation column that depicts the internals of the column and Figure 3 is a photograph of a large vacuum distillation column in a petroleum refinery.

The 10 to 40 mmHg absolute pressure in a vacuum distillation column increases the volume of vapor formed per volume of liquid distilled. The result is that such columns have very large diameters.

Distillation columns such those in Images 1 and 2, may have diameters of 15 meters or more, heights ranging up to about 50 meters, and feed rates ranging up to about 25,400 cubic meters per day (160,000 barrels per day).

The vacuum distillation column internals must provide good vapor–liquid contacting while, at the same time, maintaining a very low-pressure increase from the top of the column top to the bottom. Therefore, the vacuum column uses distillation trays only where products are withdrawn from the side of the column (referred to as &quot;side draws&quot;). Most of the column uses packing material for the vapor–liquid contacting because such packing has a lower pressure drop than distillation trays. This packing material can be either structured sheet metal or randomly dumped packing such as Raschig rings.

The absolute pressure of 10 to 40 mmHg in the vacuum column is most often achieved by using multiple stages of steam jet ejectors.

Many industries, other than the petroleum refining industry, use vacuum distillation on a much smaller scale. Copenhagen-based Empirical Spirits, a distillery founded by former Noma chefs, uses the process to create uniquely flavoured spirits. Their flagship spirit, Helena, is created using Koji, alongside Pilsner Malt and Belgian Saison Yeast.

==Large-scale water purification==
Vacuum distillation is often used in large industrial plants as an efficient way to remove salt from ocean water, in order to produce fresh water. This is known as desalination. The ocean water is placed under a vacuum to lower its boiling point and has a heat source applied, allowing the fresh water to boil off and be condensed. The condensing of the water vapor prevents the water vapor from filling the vacuum chamber, and allows the effect to run continuously without a loss of vacuum pressure. The heat from condensation of the water vapor is removed by a heat sink, which uses the incoming ocean water as the coolant and thus preheats the feed of ocean water. Some forms of distillation do not use condensers, but instead compress the vapor mechanically with a pump. This acts as a heat pump, concentrating the heat from the vapor and allowing for the heat to be returned and reused by the incoming untreated water source. There are several forms of vacuum distillation of water, with the most common being multiple-effect distillation, vapor-compression desalination, and multi-stage flash distillation.

==Molecular distillation==
Molecular distillation is vacuum distillation below the pressure of 0.01 torr (1.3 Pa). 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above high vacuum, where fluids are in the free molecular flow regime, i.e. the mean free path of molecules is comparable to the size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, the rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between.

Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.

<doc id="808774" wikidata="Q6161906" url="?curid=808774" title="Jason Akermanis">
<text>Jason Dean Akermanis (born 24 February 1977) is a former professional Australian rules football player who played in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is a Brownlow Medallist and triple premiership player who played for the Brisbane Bears, Brisbane Lions and Western Bulldogs.

==Early life==
Akermanis was born in Mildura, Victoria, to a Canadian father John Akermanis, and an Australian mother Shona Carswell, but moved to Brisbane at 9 years of age. Upon arriving in Queensland in 1986, Akermanis signed up to play for the Mayne under-10s side.

When he was 13, Akermanis discovered that he was not the son of his mother&#x27;s former partner, John Akermanis. His biological father was Denis Dezdjek, a mechanic from Mildura with whom his mother had had an affair. He was educated at Wavell State High School then at St. Joseph&#x27;s Nudgee College and played football with the Mayne Football Club in the QAFL where he was spotted by Brisbane Bears talent scouts. He completed year 12 at high school in 1995, during his first year with the Brisbane Bears.

==AFL career==

===Brisbane Bears (1995–1996)===
Akermanis was a solid contributor to the Brisbane Bears midfield (wing), with his pace and skills evident even early in his career.

Akermanis made his debut in Round 4 of the 1995 AFL season, he had a solid debut, accumulating 19 disposals and kicking 1 goal in the Bears loss to Carlton. He played a total of 17 games in this debut season and kicking 12 goals.

The 1996 AFL season saw Akermanis play 21 games and kick 32 goals for the season, he doubled his disposal count from the previous season to finish with 328 total disposals for the season. His season was highlighted with a 19 disposal &amp; 6 goal effort against the West Coast Eagles in Round 17.

===Brisbane Lions (1997–2006)===
It was after the Brisbane Lions formed that he began to shine, bulking up significantly, and a move to the forward line enabled him to make the most of his opportunities and develop a reputation as a goal sneak.
Akermanis played 34 games across the 1997 and 1998 seasons and tallied 532 disposals and 32 goals.

1999 AFL season saw Akermanis have a breakout year, winning the Merrett–Murray Medal as Brisbane&#x27;s Best &amp; Fairest player for the season. Jason gathered 469 disposals and booted 16 goals for the season.

Akermanis became one of the Brisbane Lions&#x27; most talented players. His flamboyant talents and bleached-blond hair and contrasting black beard make him easy to identify on the field. At the Lions he made his name as a speedy midfielder or on-baller with blistering acceleration and an uncanny ability to kick exceptionally well with either foot, talents which helped him win the AFL&#x27;s Brownlow Medal in 2001 in which he polled 23 votes to beat Adelaide&#x27;s Andrew McLeod. The 2001 season saw Jason tally 510 disposals and kick 28 goals for the season, ultimately capping off a magnificent week/season, finishing as a premiership player.

The 2002 AFL season saw Akermanis impact the scoreboard by kicking 49 goals for the season, and becoming a premiership player again, as the Brisbane Lions defeated Collingwood in the decider. Akermanis played with a torn right adductor, in which he suffered early in the first quarter, this effected his ability to kick with his dominant right foot, resulting in Jason kicking on his left foot for the majority of the game, he eventually kicked a left foot snap over his shoulder late in the last quarter in which would be the sealer, guiding the Lions to victory.

Akermanis is also known for his goal-scoring abilities. He was a winner of the AFL Goal of the Year 2002 award and had an ability to kick goals from acute angles. In a match in 2005, he kicked two goals within minutes of each other from almost exactly the same spot: deep in the right forward pocket on the run. Early in the 2006 season, Akermanis was dropped from the Brisbane Lions side for Round 7, playing a game with the Suncoast Lions. This coincided with inflammatory comments that he made about the coach, Leigh Matthews, during the week, and there was speculation that his time at the club was up only a few months after he had won the 2005 club best and fairest award. However, Akermanis was soon recalled to the side and responded with 22 disposals across half-back in the game against Port Adelaide, and a post-match interview with Channel Nine showed him smiling and visibly happy with his performance. On 27 July 2006 it was reported that the coaching panel and senior playing group had voted unanimously (12–0) to not allow him back into the club.

===Western Bulldogs (2007–2010)===
On 6 September, it was reported that the Western Bulldogs were leading in the race to sign Akermanis for the 2007 season. On 15 September, Akermanis confirmed that he wanted to join the Bulldogs. It was then down to the Lions agreeing on the trade price, which they did on 9 October, when Brisbane Lions football manager Graeme Allan announced that the team had agreed to trade Akermanis to the Bulldogs.

At the end of the 2008 season, Akermanis made a statement that he would retire at the end of 2009 when his three-year contract expired, however he displayed excellent form at the start of the 2009 season, and later retracted his earlier comment about retirement. Western Bulldogs coach Rodney Eade said he had not ruled out the possibility of extending Akermanis&#x27;s contract depending on his performance for the rest of the season. He then signed with the Bulldogs for another year, hoping to play in a fourth premiership side. It is assumed his contract would be for substantially less pay than his previous deal, which is estimated at between $350,000 and $400,000 a year.

In July 2010 it was announced that the Western Bulldogs had terminated Akermanis&#x27; contract due to the club&#x27;s judgement that the two were on different paths. At the time of his sacking, he was one of only two former Brisbane Bears players left in the AFL, with the other being Daniel Bradshaw. He and Bradshaw were also the last remaining members of the Brisbane Lions inaugural 1997 list.

===Post-AFL playing career===
Akermanis began playing with the Glenorchy Football Club in the Tasmanian State League in 2011 as well as playing a number of one-off games at various country clubs. In 2013, he became captain-coach of the North Albury Football Club in the Ovens &amp; Murray Football League.

=== Over-40 Men&#x27;s International rules coaching appointment ===
Akermanis served as coach for the Australian Men&#x27;s over-40s team in international rules football.

==Controversy==
Akermanis threatened to switch codes to rugby union in 2002 if Brisbane signed former Kangaroos Football Club star Wayne Carey, and leaked to the media that teammate Nigel Lappin had broken his ribs during the 2003 preliminary final against Sydney.

In 2007, Akermanis wrote a column about performance-enhancing drugs and his views on their presence in sport, which included comments that he believed a specific opposing player, whom he did not name, had been using the drugs based on how strong a runner the player was for his size. The Seven Network and Fairfax Media inferred and named the player as the West Coast Eagles&#x27; Michael Braun, damaging Braun&#x27;s reputation and subjecting him to an investigation by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, which cleared him of wrongdoing. Braun was ultimately awarded defamation damages against Seven and Fairfax, and received an apology from Akermanis, who conceded that he had been referring to Braun, and admitted that he had been wrong.

In a May 2010 column, he wrote about homosexuality in sports, and expressed an opinion that he believed homosexual players should stay in the closet, as he did not believe football culture was at that time ready to fully accept them. Numerous people spoke out against his column, and the Western Bulldogs, who were worried about the negative publicity, suspended him for two matches for not having the column approved by the club before having it published. Akermanis would later be dismissed by the Western Bulldogs two months later, partly related to leaking confidential team information to the media as part of a media career which the Bulldogs believed was taking an undue amount of his focus.

In a radio interview shortly after the death of former Melbourne Football Club player and president Jim Stynes in 2012, Akermanis commented that Stynes was &quot;a nasty man in his day&quot;, was treated as a &quot;demi-god&quot;, and questioned his deservedness to receive a state funeral just two days after Stynes&#x27; death.

In October 2014, Akermanis was suspended for four matches as head coach of the North Albury Football Club after being found guilty of breaching the AFL Victoria cyber-bullying policy in regards to several umpires&#x27; decisions during the 2014 Ovens &amp; Murray Football League season.

By 2019, Akermanis had reportedly been banned by three golf clubs for alleged cheating incidents. Akermanis denied the clubs’ claims.

In October 2023, Akermanis was featured in the reality TV show &quot;SAS Australia&quot;. He left in the first episode due to what he claimed was a toe injury; however, medical personnel for the show disputed this claim.

In November 2023, while working as a real estate agent, it was reported that Akermanis disclosed sensitive personal information about a survivor of domestic abuse to a potential property buyer, among other ethical impropriety. Akermanis&#x27;s ethical violation was reported by &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and print media.

==Personal life==
Akermanis is married to Megan Legge, a speech pathologist. They have three daughters. Akermanis learned Auslan to communicate with his wife&#x27;s hearing-impaired parents. He also speaks Spanish.

<text>Heise Gruppe GmbH &amp; Co. KG is a German media conglomerate headquartered in Hanover. It was founded in 1949 by Heinz Heise and is still family-owned. Its core business is directory media as well as general-interest and specialist media from the fields of computer technology, information technology and network culture. Another focus of its business activities is portals for price and product comparisons.

== History ==
In 1949, founded the publishing house named after him in Hanover-Badenstedt. The company&#x27;s first product was an address book for the town of Bünde, later joined by the telephone directory for Einbeck. Gradually, other cities and regions were added to the product range. In addition, Heise expanded the program to include non-fiction topics, such as manuals on law. By 1960, sales had risen to over one million marks.

In 1972, Heinz Heise handed over the management of the company to his son . Under his leadership, a magazine for electronics and technology topics, was created. The first issue of the computer magazine c&#x27;t appeared in 1983, followed by the professional magazine iX in 1988. Both publications are still around today. Later, the IT sector was further expanded with the acquisition of the Heidelberg-based Dpunkt Verlag.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Heise expanded into the states of the former Eastern Bloc. In 1992, the company took over the long-established publishing house in Rostock. Having previously invested in regional radio stations, Heise participated in the founding of , a private radio station in Lower Saxony, in year 2000. Additionally, Heise invested in digital business models with partner publishers: and appeared online for the first time. The news portal &quot;heise.de&quot; was created and supplemented by Telepolis and other channels. The MIT magazine Technology Review, whose German-language version has been published by Heise since 2003, was widely recognized.

In recent years, price comparison portals have taken on greater importance at Heise. The company has stakes in &quot;billiger.de&quot;, &quot;guenstiger.de&quot; and &quot;geizhals.at&quot;.

== Publications ==
Heise publishes &quot;Das Örtliche&quot; and &quot;Das Telefonbuch&quot; as well as the Gelbe Seiten in joint editorial and publishing partnership with Deutsche Tele Medien. The media are published in printed form, as a web application and for mobile devices. In addition to a simple entry, Heise offers small and medium-sized companies a wide range of online marketing services.

The IT news portal &quot;heise.de&quot; is leading in German-speaking countries. It also includes the media brands c&#x27;t, iX, Make, Mac &amp; i, Technology Review, heise Autos, TechStage and Telepolis. The company uses the brands both online and for magazines, as well as for events, especially congresses, conferences, seminars and workshops, including &quot;Heise Adacemy&quot;.

<doc id="808818" wikidata="Q12183232" url="?curid=808818" title="Health effects of tea">
<text>The health effects of tea have been studied throughout human history. In clinical research conducted over the early 21st century, tea has been studied extensively for its potential to lower the risk of human diseases, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any therapeutic uses other than possibly increasing alertness, an effect caused by caffeine in the tea leaves.

A small number of studies suggests that both green and black tea might have beneficial effects on some cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure and cholesterol. The research has limitations though, including how the data were evaluated and differences in study populations, leading to no certain conclusions about health effects.

In regions without access to safe drinking water, boiling water is effective for reducing waterborne diseases by destroying pathogenic microorganisms, and this water can be used to make tea.

== By constituents or substances ==

=== Aluminum, iron and other metals ===

Tea drinking accounts for a high proportion of aluminum in the human diet. The levels are safe, but there has been some concern that aluminum traces may be associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. A 2013 study additionally indicated that some teas contained lead (mostly Chinese) and aluminum (Indian/Sri Lanka blends, China). There is still insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions on this subject.

Most studies have found no association between tea intake and iron absorption. However, drinking excessive amounts of black tea may inhibit the absorption of iron, and may harm people with anaemia.

Concerns have been raised about the traditional method of over-boiling tea to produce a decoction, which may increase the amount of environmental contaminants released and consumed.

=== Fluoride exposure ===

All tea leaves contain fluoride; however, mature leaves contain as much as 10 to 20 times the fluoride levels of young leaves from the same plant.

The fluoride content of a tea leaf depends on the leaf picking method used and the fluoride content of the soil from which it has been grown; tea plants absorb this element at a greater rate than other plants. Care in the choice of the location where the plant is grown may reduce the risk. It is speculated that hand-picked tea would contain less fluoride than machine-harvested tea, because there is a much lower chance of harvesting older leaves during the harvest process. A 2013 British study of 38 teas found that cheaper UK supermarket tea blends had the highest levels of fluoride with about 580 mg per kilogram, green teas averaged about 397 mg per kg and pure blends about 132 mg per kg. The researchers suggested that economy teas may use older leaves which contain more fluoride. They calculated a person drinking a litre of economy tea per day would consume about 6 mg of fluoride, above the recommended average dietary intake level of 3–4 mg of fluoride per day, but below the maximum tolerable amount of 10 mg of fluoride per day. Brick tea, made from fallen leaves, old leaves and stems has the highest levels.

One study indicated that green tea leaves have an average fluoride concentration of 52 mg/kg, and approximately 89% of the fluoride was released from the leaves into tea after brewing.

=== Oxalates ===
Tea contains oxalate, overconsumption of which can cause kidney stones, as well as binding with free calcium in the body. The bioavailability of oxalate from tea is low, thus a possible negative effect requires a large intake of tea. Massive black tea consumption has been linked to kidney failure due to its high oxalate content (acute oxalate nephropathy).

=== Theanine and caffeine ===

Tea also contains theanine and the stimulant caffeine at about 3% of its dry weight, translating to between 30 mg and 90 mg per depending on type, brand and brewing method. Tea also contains small amounts of theobromine and theophylline. Dry tea has more caffeine by weight than dry coffee; nevertheless, more dry coffee than dry tea is used in typical drink preparations, which results in a cup of brewed tea containing significantly less caffeine than a cup of coffee of the same size.

The caffeine in tea is a mild diuretic. However, the British Dietetic Association has suggested that tea can be used to supplement normal water consumption, and that &quot;the style of tea and coffee and the amounts we drink in the UK are unlikely to have a negative effect [on hydration]&quot;.

== By conditions ==

===Cognitive effects===
Drinking caffeinated tea may improve mental alertness due to the effects of caffeine.

=== Cancer ===
In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration reported that there was little evidence to support the claim that green tea consumption may reduce the risk of breast and prostate cancer.

A 2010 report by the US National Cancer Institute stated that epidemiological studies and the few clinical trials of tea for the prevention of cancer were inconclusive. The institute &quot;does not recommend for or against the use of tea to reduce the risk of any type of cancer.&quot; ... &quot;Inconsistencies in study findings regarding tea and cancer risk may be due to variability in tea preparation, tea consumption, the bioavailability of tea compounds (the amounts that can be absorbed by the body), lifestyle differences, and individual genetic differences.&quot; Though there is some positive evidence for risk reduction of breast, prostate, ovarian, and endometrial cancers with green tea, it is weak and inconclusive.

Meta-analyses of observational studies have concluded that black tea consumption does not appear to protect against the development of oral cancers in Asian or Caucasian populations, the development of esophageal cancer or prostate cancer in Asian populations, or the development of lung cancer. In 2018, a meta-analysis based on 14 case-control studies found that tea consumption appears protective of oral cancer with a greater decrease in risk occurring with a larger intake (except for black tea and American people).

The consumption of very hot tea could increase the risk of esophageal cancer.

===Cardiovascular disease===
In preliminary long-term clinical studies, black tea consumption showed evidence for providing a small reduction in the risk of stroke, whereas, in another review, green tea and black tea did not have significant effects on the risk of coronary heart disease. Two reviews of randomized controlled trials concluded that long-term consumption of black tea slightly lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressures (about 1–2 mmHg), a finding based on limited evidence. A 2013 Cochrane review found some evidence of benefit from tea consumption on cardiovascular markers (total and LDL cholesterol), though more research is needed.

===Fracture risk===
Tea consumption does not appear to affect the risk of bone fracture including hip fractures or fractures of the humerus in men or women.

=== Weight loss ===
Although green tea is commonly believed to be a weight loss aid, there is no good evidence that its long-term consumption has any meaningful benefit in helping overweight or obese people to lose weight, or that it helps to maintain a healthy body weight. Use of green tea for attempted weight loss carries a small risk of adverse effects, such as nausea, constipation, and stomach discomfort.

<doc id="808827" wikidata="Q7181541" url="?curid=808827" title="Phi Kappa Theta">
<text>Phi Kappa Theta (), commonly known as Phi Kap, is a national social fraternity that has over 35 active chapters and colonies at universities across 21 U.S. states. The fraternity was founded on April 29, 1959, at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, with the agreed-upon merger of two older Catholic fraternities, [[Phi Kappa Fraternity (Catholic)|Phi Kappa]] and [[Theta Kappa Phi]]. Phi Kappa was founded exactly 70 years prior in 1889 at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, while Theta Kappa Phi was founded later in October 1919 at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Despite it being the merger of two historically Catholic fraternities, membership to Phi Kappa Theta is open to interested men of all faiths and is no longer exclusive to just those who are Catholic.

==History==

===Phi Kappa (1889–1959)===
Phi Kappa was founded on April 29, 1889, at Hope Hall of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. At the time of its founding, the fraternity was the tenth such Greek letter organization existing at Brown, but the first to accept Catholic students. This is shown in the choice of Phi Kappa&#x27;s original name: Phi Kappa Sigma, which stood as the Greek letter equivalent for &quot;Fraternity of Catholic Students&quot;. Its nine founders, present at the October 1 meeting, were: 
Gillrain was elected from the group as Phi Kappa Sigma&#x27;s first president, while McGinn became the first secretary. The infant fraternity would meet in the dormitories of Hope College until the spring of 1890 when meetings moved to the Wayland Building.

The History notes that the first three initiates were: William H. Magill, John J. Fitzgerald, and Thomas P. Corcoran. In addition to the nine listed founders, Baird&#x27;s Manual, 20th ed. adds these first three initiates, along with Joseph Kirwen, as the fraternity&#x27;s founders, for a total of 13.

On April 29, 1892, a meeting of Phi Kappa Sigma&#x27;s graduate and collegiate members was called by M. Joseph Harson, a Providence merchant with an interest in the fraternity. It was here at this meeting that a plan was put forward for the fraternity&#x27;s official establishment at Brown. Harson wrote the initiation ritual, while the group would adopt a constitution, a form of organization for the chapter, and elect Harson as president. The fraternity would go on to initiate its first new members in 1893. Ten years later on April 29, 1902, the fraternity, now known as Phi Kappa, would be incorporated under the laws of the State of Rhode Island. Over another decade, Phi Kappa&#x27;s &quot;Beta chapter&quot; would be founded through the incorporation of the Loyola Club of the University of Illinois on May 27, 1912.

Over the following years, Phi Kappa would expand to several universities across the United States, particularly around the Midwest and Northeast. Five additional chapters would be founded by 1919, bringing the total to seven nationwide. Over the next decade, Phi Kappa would see major expansion, tripling in size by the time of the fraternity&#x27;s 40th anniversary year in 1929.

Five chapters alone were founded within the first half of 1925, four of whom continue to be active today. The rapid growth Phi Kappa enjoyed would largely disappear in the subsequent two decades. The Great Depression gripping the United States in the 1930s and its entry into the Second World War in 1941 would see only five new chapters chartered between 1930 and 1950. A third of Phi Kappa&#x27;s chapters, including the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; at Brown, would go inactive during the Great Depression. Steady growth would resume in Phi Kappa&#x27;s final years during the 1950s. At the time of the merger in 1959, 36 of the 39 Phi Kappa chapters chartered were still open and active, including the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; at Brown University.

===Theta Kappa Phi (1919–1959)===
Theta Kappa Phi was founded on October 1, 1919, at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The idea for the organization developed from a group of men who were a part of the university&#x27;s Newman Club that were interested in establishing a social fraternity. Of this original group, three men would go on to be the first members and founders of Theta Kappa Phi: 

Plans for the official establishment of the fraternity fell through upon the entry of the United States into the First World War in 1917, with several members subsequently joining the armed forces. Following the conclusion of the war in November 1918 and the return of members back to school, Carr led efforts to restart the process of establishing a social fraternity at Lehigh. Ultimately thirty men, including Concilio, Carr, and Bobbin, agreed to the establishment of the X Club, the original name of Theta Kappa Phi.

During the first few months of the new fraternity&#x27;s existence, several important actions were undertaken. In a meeting on November 12, 1919, the X Club would select Theta Kappa Phi as its new name. At the time of its adoption, the letters simply stood in place for ‘The Catholic Fraternity’ before they were given a secret meaning later on upon merger into Phi Kappa Theta in 1959. The founding group would elect Concilio as the fraternity&#x27;s first president. Under him, he successfully began the infant fraternity&#x27;s nationalization by unifying with the local fraternity of Kappa Theta at Pennsylvania State University, establishing the group there as its &quot;Beta chapter&quot; on March 22, 1922.

Meanwhile, the fraternity would receive valuable help and inspiring leadership from local Bethlehem pastor, Rev. William I. McGarvey. Since none of the existing members had fraternity experience, McGarvey was a valuable asset in developing the fledgling group into a true fraternity in its early days. McGarvey would additionally secure the help of Rev. Michael Andrew Chapman in writing Theta Kappa Phi&#x27;s ritual, who was an Episcopal priest as well as a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon at Bard College.

The basics of Theta Kappa Phi&#x27;s ritual are still used in Phi Kappa Theta&#x27;s ritual today, while McGarvey&#x27;s effort for Theta Kappa Phi have seen him recognized as the fraternity&#x27;s fourth founder, alongside Concilio, Carr, and Bobbin.

Theta Kappa Phi would continue to expand to other colleges and universities in the surrounding region. By the time the merger came about in 1959, Theta Kappa Phi maintained 24 open and active chapters across the United States.

===Merger into Phi Kappa Theta===
Phi Kappa and Theta Kappa Phi were both founded upon Catholic principles. As such, the two fraternities had extensive interactions in the years that lead up to their eventual merger. Four chapters from each would share the same host institution (University of Illinois, Pennsylvania State University, Ohio State University, and University of Missouri) by 1959. In 1921, only two years after Theta Kappa Phi&#x27;s founding, Phi Kappa proposed a merger with them. However, Theta Kappa Phi declined and merged instead with Kappa Theta, a local fraternity at Penn State, in 1922. Over fifteen years would pass until talks of a potential merger began again in 1938. A joint committee, sanctioned by both fraternities and attended by representatives from both groups, was created to discuss this possibility.

Discussion and negotiations pertaining to the merger would continue over the next two decades. By 1957, both Phi Kappa and Theta Kappa Phi had 58 active chapters on 54 campuses across over 20 states. That same year, both fraternities agreed to negotiations conducted at Ohio State University towards unifying their respective fraternities. Committees from both fraternities were created towards discussion on several issues regarding the merger, including the national name, coat of arms, constitution, leadership, and ritual among many others.

In 1958, both Phi Kappa and Theta Kappa Phi simultaneously held their Biennial Conferences at Ohio State to begin final approval of the merger. On September 8, 1958, an agreement was reached, and both respective fraternities ratified the unification and authorized their respective national councils to begin implementation of the consolidation agreement. Over the following eight months, the new unified ritual was established as well as a new insignia for the united fraternity designed. Additionally, new procedures for the united fraternity was adopted, while the two fraternities alumni supervisory boards were consolidated.

It was decided that the official charter day of Phi Kappa Theta would be celebrated at Ohio State University on April 29, 1959, coinciding with the seventieth anniversary of the founding of Phi Kappa. At the time of the merger of the two fraternities, it was the first of its kind in the history of the American fraternal system. Phi Kappa&#x27;s last president, Pierre Lavedan, was selected to be Phi Kappa Theta&#x27;s first president, while Theta Kappa Phi&#x27;s last president, Frank Flick, was selected to be Phi Kappa Theta&#x27;s first chairman of the board. At the four universities where both a Phi Kappa and Theta Kappa Phi chapter existed together, the two chapters merged as well, combining their chapter names into a single designation. On December 12, 1959, the &quot;Alpha Rho chapter&quot; at Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina, would become Phi Kappa Theta&#x27;s first chartered chapter, post merger.

==Ideals==

<doc id="808833" wikidata="Q24684" url="?curid=808833" title="Wildcat (DC Comics)">
<text>Wildcat is the name of several fictional characters, all DC Comics superheroes, the first and most famous being [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Theodore]] &quot;[[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Ted]]&quot; [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Grant]], a long-time member of the Justice Society of America (JSA). A world-class heavyweight boxer, Grant became entangled inadvertently in the criminal underworld and developed a costumed identity to clear his name.

Other characters have taken Grant&#x27;s name and identity, including his goddaughter [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez]], who served as a temporary replacement for him, and his son Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Bronson, a metahuman werecat who is tutored by him as a second Wildcat and a JSA member in late-2000s stories.

Ted Grant has made several appearances in DC media, such as the third season of &quot;Arrow&quot;, in which he was portrayed by J. R. Ramirez, and the DC Universe streaming service show &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Brian Stapf. Additionally, Yolanda Montez also appears in &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Yvette Monreal.

==Fictional character biography==
===Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Grant===

The Ted Grant version of Wildcat first appeared in &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; #1 and was created by writer Bill Finger, and designed by illustrator Irwin Hasen.

===Yolanda Montez===
Born with metahuman powers due to the machinations of the villainous Doctor Benjamin Love, Yolanda Montez was the goddaughter of Ted Grant, who was a good friend of her father &quot;Mauler&quot; Montez. As a result of the prenatal treatments given to her mother, Yolanda was born with retractable claws on her fingers and toes and cat-like agility. Initially, she concealed her abilities and lived a normal life. She later became a journalist working for &quot;Rock Stars Magazine&quot;. When Ted was injured in the Crisis, Yolanda used her powers to become the new Wildcat. She then joined Infinity Inc. afterwards. She and her Infinity Inc. teammate Beth Chapel were later killed by Eclipso, who would later possess her cousin Alex.

===Hector Ramirez===
Hector Ramirez first appeared in &quot;Batman/Wildcat&quot; # 1 (April 1997) and was created by Chuck Dixon, Beau Smith, and Sergio Cariello. He was a boxing protégé of Ted Grant. After learning that Ted used to be Wildcat, Hector aspired to be his successor, something that Ted had refused. Hector then took one of Ted&#x27;s old costumes and went out as Wildcat in Gotham City. In an attempt to break up a secret fight club where caged villains fought to the death, Ramirez was himself caught and later killed by Killer Croc in the ring. The operators Lock-Up and Ernie Chubb were eventually apprehended by Ted and Batman.

===Tom Bronson===

Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Bronson is Ted Grant&#x27;s youngest son. Tom&#x27;s mother Marilyn had a one-night stand with Ted, and never told him of Tom&#x27;s existence. Despite the fact that his father was not involved in his life, Tom is not bitter towards Ted. However, he did tell Ted that he had no intentions of becoming the next Wildcat, as he was not a fighter himself.

It was revealed that Tom is a metahuman that can change into a were-panther at will, similar to the Wildcat featured in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. When Ted was attacked by Vandal Savage, Tom changed into his were-panther form and managed to fight against Savage until help arrived.
In &quot;Justice Society of America 80 Page Giant Sized&quot; (2010), it was revealed that Tom&#x27;s mother had the same powers as her son, but would change involuntarily every month. After a minor battle involving Ted, Marilyn, and the first Huntress, Ted took Marilyn to see Doctor Mid-Nite, who cured her of the involuntary aspect of her power, allowing her to change at will instead. While she is unconscious, Ted told Doctor Mid-Nite to &quot;fix her and send her on her way&quot; to protect her from his dangerous walk of life. Doctor Mid-Nite discovered that she was pregnant and revealed this to his now-conscious patient. She ultimately decided to withhold this information from Ted, but her motivations were unclear. She then raised Tom herself.

Over time, Tom slowly forms a bond with Ted and eventually, after some initial reluctance, agrees to share the Wildcat name with his father. At this point, he is introduced and inducted into the Justice Society.

In a team-up with the Justice League, he talks to Vixen and indicates the presence of enhanced senses.

Later, Tom, now calling himself Tomcat, parted ways with Ted and joined the All-Stars, an offshoot team created by the younger members of the JSA.

<doc id="808844" wikidata="Q1365975" url="?curid=808844" title="Ultra Magnus">
<text>Ultra Magnus is a fictional character from the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise. Ultra Magnus is based on the Diaclone figure Powered Convoy, which is a modified version of the preexisting Battle Convoy figure. He is usually depicted as a car carrier that converts into a robot. Sometimes the tractor can detach from the trailer and convert into a white version of Optimus Prime, while the trailer can convert into armor that covers the inner robot.

==Transformers: Generation 1==
Despite his incredible fighting skills, courage, and unmatched talent for improvisation on the battlefield, Ultra Magnus is not portrayed as a natural leader and displays discomfort if the Autobot Matrix of Leadership should ever find itself placed upon him.

== Synopsis ==
In Generation One, Ultra Magnus is a commander of the Wreckers (Transformers), and his reluctance to change ensures that he expends all options before accepting the idea that he is required to lead. As a leader, Magnus is resolute, fair, and courageous, ever-ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good of his companions and mission, and unyielding in preparation for the protection of those under his command. Although not interested in overall command, Ultra Magnus was the City Commander for Autobot City in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;. His toy also featured him in the role of City Commander (a title also held by his original opposite number, the Decepticon leader Galvatron), which indicates that he at least is willing to accept a leadership role in a smaller capacity rather than as supreme commander, a role filled by both &quot;Optimus Prime&quot; and, later, Rodimus Prime.

Ultra Magnus is armed with missile launchers capable of hitting a target 30 miles away and transforms into a car carrier able to transport his fellow Autobot troops.

===Animated series===
====&quot;The Transformers&quot;====
== History ==
Ultra Magnus makes his first appearance in the Japan-exclusive &quot;&quot; (1986). &quot;Scramble City&quot; never made it to the United States, so most Americans did not see him until &quot;the 1986 animated film&quot;.

Ultra Magnus made his first continuity appearance in the Earth year 2005 as commander of Autobot City on Earth. Leading the defense of the city when it came under the Decepticon attack, Magnus suddenly found himself commanding the entire Autobot army when &quot;Optimus Prime&quot; died after his fight with Megatron and passed the Matrix of Leadership to him despite his protestations. Subsequently, in a confrontation with the Decepticons on the planet of Junk, Magnus was blown apart and lost the Matrix to Galvatron, but was reassembled and reactivated by the Junkions. When Hot Rod recovered the Matrix from Galvatron and became Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus decided to step down as leader to give the role to Rodimus, but continued to act as his friend and advisor, keeping him on the straight and narrow and always reassuring him, attempting to urge him out of the shadow of &quot;Optimus Prime&quot;.

Magnus has his share of personal adventures in 2006, such as when he was captured by a Quintesson scientist for study, along with the Wreck-Gar, Marissa Faireborn and Cyclonus; he and Cyclonus developed a mutual, grudging respect for each other as warriors during the ensuing events, as they worked together to escape a negative universe on the other side of a black hole.

Magnus would later fall afoul of an unrepentant Cyclonus when he went to the aid of Wheelie and Daniel Witwicky when they stumbled into trouble while attempting to discover Magnus&#x27; birthday. In addition to these and other battles with Cyclonus, Magnus also found himself facing Galvatron on several occasions - the deranged Decepticon would even occasionally focus his rage more upon Magnus than Rodimus Prime; such a notion is not inappropriate, since Magnus was the being he was originally dispatched to destroy, and who thwarted him in varying ways, certainly enough to permanently earn the deranged Galvatron&#x27;s ire.

In the episode &quot;Only Human&quot;, Ultra Magnus, Springer, Rodimus, and Arcee found their minds transferred into human-mimicking &quot;synthoid&quot; bodies by the human crime lord Victor Drath.

In Episode 78, &quot;Madman&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, Spike Witwicky and his wife Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel got bored and wandered off. Grimlock followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia and were tricked into fighting on the Red Wizard&#x27;s side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the Golden One. Ultra Magnus, Blaster, Eject, Rewind, Ramhorn, and Steeljaw followed, and using Blaster&#x27;s amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of Perceptor, the Autobots and Daniel are returned to Cybertron.

When the galaxy became infected by the Hate Plague, Ultra Magnus was one of the first victims, and his calm, restrained soldier attitude was stripped away, leaving behind a raving, battle-hungry maniac who had a particular interest in destroying Rodimus Prime. After the plague was cured by the resurrected &quot;Optimus Prime&quot;, Magnus subsequently led the defense of Cybertron during the battle for the power of the Plasma Energy Chamber in 2007.

In &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, Ultra Magnus was voiced by Robert Stack. For subsequent episodes of the animated series, he was voiced by Jack Angel, who had previously portrayed characters such as Astrotrain, Ramjet, and Omega Supreme. His character was most familiar for uttering the line &quot;I can&#x27;t deal with that now&quot; whenever things got bad.

=== &quot;Transformers: The Headmasters&quot; ===
Although the American animated series ended with the three-parter &quot;The Rebirth&quot; storyline, it was decided in Japan to continue production of new episodes. To that end, &quot;The Rebirth&quot; wasn&#x27;t aired there, and in its place, a new 35-episode series, &quot;&quot; was in production.

Earlier Japanese-exclusive media such as &quot;&quot; and TV Magazine&#x27;s manga stories had previously detailed Ultra Magnus&#x27; earlier arrival on Earth and his role in the creation of Metroplex. In &quot;Headmasters&quot;, Magnus was a supporting character for the early part of the series, once again in charge of Autobot City on Earth, taking a proactive role in the defense of the planet against the Decepticons when they re-emerged in 2011. During the opening skirmish of the renewed conflict, Magnus crossed swords with the large and powerful Decepticon ninja, Sixshot, who went on to lead the villains&#x27; earth-based forces, leading to a smoldering enmity between the two. Their rivalry eventually came to a conclusive end when Sixshot and Magnus engaged in a one-on-one duel. Magnus was no match for the multiple powers of Sixshot&#x27;s numerous transformations and was felled by his seventh, secret mode. With his dying gasp, Magnus told the Autobots to protect the Earth. At Metroplex&#x27;s request, the Autobots buried Magnus on Earth.

When Ultra Magnus died, his body didn&#x27;t turn monochromatic, like all other Transformers who had died in the past (including those in the &quot;Headmasters&quot; series). Whether this is due to his body being composed of external armor over his truck-cab exoskeleton (like the original toy and Dreamwave comic), or simply because of animator error, is open to fan interpretation.

As &quot;The Headmasters&quot; cartoon is set in an alternative &quot;Japanese continuity&quot; which officially doesn&#x27;t belong to the original American series that ended with the 4th season in a three-piece episode titled &quot;The Rebirth&quot;, Ultra Magnus did not die in the scope of the original continuity.

===Marvel Comics===
Ultra Magnus did not appear in Marvel Comics&#x27; American &quot;Transformers&quot; comic book series outside of a comic book adaptation of a third-season episode of the animated &quot;Transformers&quot; series. However, the series&#x27; sister title in the U.K. &quot;did&quot; feature in the character extensively in its own original stories (particularly issues in and around the 100 mark); the American stories made little use of the new cast introduced in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, and U.K. writer Simon Furman pounced on the opportunity to use them in his own ways. Whereas all the other movie characters who appeared in the stories — such as Galvatron, Hot Rod and Kup — appeared via the use of time travel, it was Ultra Magnus&#x27; present-day self who played a key role in many of the important UK storylines. As per the original intent of his character and toy, Magnus was presented as the arch-foe of Galvatron.

Ultra Magnus was first introduced — and, debatably, first &quot;constructed&quot; — in the Earth year 1986, as the underground Autobot resistance on Cybertron prepared to execute their daring &quot;Operation: Volcano&quot; plan, which would involve luring the Decepticons&#x27; crack troops to one location where Magnus and the Autobot commando squad, the Wreckers, would finish them off. However, when the Matrix Flame (a flame denoting the activity of the robot containing the Creation Matrix) suddenly extinguished, Magnus was dispatched to Earth to discover what had happened to &quot;Optimus Prime&quot;.

With time nipping at his heels, the launch of Operation: Volcano going ahead whether he returned or not, Magnus allied himself with the Earth Autobots and worked to discover what had caused &quot;Optimus Prime&quot;, Prowl and Ratchet to vanish from the middle of the Autobot base, while the other Autobots battled the threat posed by Galvatron, a Decepticon who had traveled back in time from the future. The appearance of three more Autobots from the future, Hot Rod, Kup, and Blurr, gave Magnus his answer: the mass-displacement effect yielded by Galvatron&#x27;s time travel had shunted Prime and the others into the limbo between dimensions. Ultra Magnus then engaged Galvatron in battle as Kup and the others set up a scheme to force Galvatron back into the future, and even though Magnus was severely beaten by the more powerful Decepticon, the plan succeeded and the future Decepticon returned to his own time. Magnus, however, was too late to return for Operation: Volcano, but the plan was nullified when the intended Decepticon victims were called away by Megatron, but a parting shot took the life of the Wreckers&#x27; leader, Impactor.

In 1987, when &quot;Optimus Prime&quot; was transported to Cybertron, Ultra Magnus and the Wreckers nearly killed him due to deliberate Decepticon misinformation that claimed he was a masquerading Decepticon agent which was disproved by Emirate Xaaron. Prime and Magnus then fought side-by-side on Cybertron for a period, until Ratbat cleverly deployed the Spacebridge to displace Magnus, Prime, and an insane Megatron to Earth. As Magnus adjusted to his temporary new home, he stumbled across Galvatron, who had returned from the future with a new scheme to harness the power of the Earth&#x27;s core. Continuing their deeply bitter feud, Galvatron battled Ultra Magnus with help from the future Autobots, but in the end, the two leaders were entombed in volcanic lava.

Galvatron was eventually able to effect his own release, and the Sparkler Mini-Bots (also known as the Sparkabots) extricated Ultra Magnus, who, by this stage, having suffered repeated defeats at Galvatron&#x27;s hands, had developed a paralyzing fear of confronting the Decepticon. Galvatron, to his own amusement, set about pulverizing the Sparklers, with the intention of further tormenting the temporarily quiescent Ultra Magnus. With his comrades&#x27; lives at risk, Magnus overcame his demons to defeat Galvatron.

The present-day Ultra Magnus would not have to face Galvatron again, but more terrifying threats were in store when he and the Sparklers returned to Cybertron and discovered that the city of Kalis had been overridden by hordes of zombie Transformers, reactivated by the renegade Autobot mad scientist, Flame. Ultra Magnus joined forces with the Wreckers and their allies to defeat Flame&#x27;s plan to fire Cybertron&#x27;s subterranean planetary engines and complete Megatron&#x27;s ancient plan to turn the world into a huge battleship.

Soon after, Magnus found himself involved in a grotesque illegal Gladiatorial game, and although he defeated his monstrous opponent and delivered a stirring speech to the crowd decrying their spectation of such a sport, his words failed to get through.

Although that was the last appearance of the present-day Ultra Magnus, the future version of Ultra Magnus (from the same era as Rodimus Prime) made further appearances. He was present when Rodimus Prime, Kup, and Blurr went back in time to confront Galvatron and Death&#x27;s Head, stating his doubts about the mission, teamed up with Soundwave&#x27;s Decepticons to defeat the Quintessons, and was part of Rodimus Prime&#x27;s team in the Time Wars. He did not get his final confrontation with Galvatron, however, as Galvatron used Decepticon leader Scorponok as a living shield against Magnus&#x27; fire, prompting Scorponok&#x27;s troops to attack him.

The U.K. &quot;Transformers&quot; continuity records that Magnus and the other future Autobots returned find to their own time-stream changed to a different, darker future, where Galvatron was alive and ruling most of Cybertron.

===Books===
Ultra Magnus appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book &quot;The Lost Treasure of Cybertron&quot; by Marvel Books.

Ultra Magnus appeared in the 1986 story book &quot;Galvatron&#x27;s Air Attack&quot; by Ladybird Books.

Ultra Magnus appeared in the 1986 Ladybird Books story &quot;Decepticon Hideout&quot; by John Grant.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Ultra Magnus from Dreamwave Productions&#x27; 21st-century re-imagining of the Generation One universe took the opportunity to indulge two contentious aspects of Ultra Magnus previously resigned to fan speculation: here, he was revealed to be Optimus Prime&#x27;s &quot;brother&quot; in the Dreamwave continuity, and also hinted to be Dion, a childhood friend of Optimus Prime from the animated series, due to the name of a strike force he led.

Magnus&#x27; first chronological appearance was in &quot;The War Within: Age of Wrath&quot; miniseries, where he had united the splintered Autobot factions such as the Wreckers and Lightning Strike Coalition (who had struck out on their own following Optimus Prime and Megatron&#x27;s disappearance in a Space Bridge accident) and managed to negotiate a settlement with the Decepticons and Ultracons. The plan was derailed first by Starscream&#x27;s Predacons and then by Megatron&#x27;s return with an army of Seeker clones, with Grimlock taking a fatal shot meant for Magnus. After being beaten into submission by Megatron, Magnus was amongst those captured by the Decepticons. The closure of Dreamwave prevented the completion of the series.

Following the disappearance of Optimus Prime and Megatron&#x27;s troops four million years ago, Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus took fluctuating joint leadership of the Autobots until Maximus abandoned the war.

Ultra Magnus appeared as a major character in Dreamwave Productions&#x27; &quot;Micromasters&quot; mini-series. In issue #1, &quot;Destined For Nothing&quot;, Countdown and Groundshaker return from space to find the Autobot base largely abandoned. The first Autobots they encounter, Topspin and Twin Twist seem surprised to see them, and more surprised that Optimus Prime isn&#x27;t with them. Countdown and Groundshaker are equally surprised that Optimus has not returned to Cybertron before they did. Countdown confronts Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus and informs them that Operation: Containment, an attempt to prevent the Decepticon threat from spreading beyond Cybertron, has failed. Countdown explains that the Decepticon Skystalker and his forces ravaged the peaceful planet, Paradron and that the Autobots need to mount an intergalactic patrol force to prevent the same fate from befalling other worlds. Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus disagree, stating that Autobot forces are already underpowered and spread thin as it is. Groundshaker interrupts, belligerently demanding the Autobot command take action before he is pulled from the room by Countdown. As Countdown and Groundshaker leave the command center, they overhear Big Daddy and his patrol griping about the day&#x27;s events, which interests Countdown greatly. Big Daddy and company then confront Magnus and Maximus, upset that Crunch lost his life defending Roadbuster. The argument grows more heated before Fortress Maximus orders the Hot Rod Patrol to turn in their weapons and dismisses them.

100,000 years later, the Transformers, their war, and the entire planet of Cybertron itself ground to a halt when the world&#x27;s energy supplies completely ran out, sending Cybertron into a period of reconstructive hibernation, during which the entire population was sent into stasis.

Three thousand years ago, Shockwave was the first Transformer to be reactivated, and set about restoring the planet and its populace, quietly working towards his own sinister ends. Unifying the Autobot and Decepticon factions, he appointed Ultra Magnus as his second-in-command, who led the attack on the Ark when they traveled to Earth and arrested Optimus Prime and Megatron as war criminals. (In reference to the theory that Ultra Magnus was formerly Dion, the name of the team Ultra Magnus led to take the Autobots into custody was team Dion.)

When Optimus Prime then led a rebel attack on Iacon, Shockwave turned on Magnus, apparently deactivating him. Ultra Magnus survived, however, and his inner robot emerged from his damaged larger form, teaming with Prime to stop Shockwave&#x27;s plan to use the Matrix to access Vector Sigma.

Ultra Magnus came away from the encounter with less damage than Prime and soon had his systems repaired. He was seen in his familiar blue outer shell assisting Prowl when the burden of leadership threatened to become too much for him and headed a mission to one of Cybertron&#x27;s moons to fortify it against attack. Dreamwave&#x27;s bankruptcy and subsequent closure, however, meant that any further stories of Ultra Magnus went untold.

===Fun Publications===
The &quot;Transformers: Classics&quot; story printed by Fun Publications is set in a continuation of the Marvel Comics Transformers series, ignoring the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics. Since Ultra Magnus only appeared in the U.K. comics (baring the movie adaption), the Ultra Magnus appearing in these stories is a new character.

In Transformers: Timelines volume 2 #2, &quot;Games of Deception&quot; this series Ultra Magnus leads a team of Autobots, which includes Elita One, Huffer, Snarl, Springer, Strongarm, Swoop and Tryanotron in pursuit of the Decepticon Bug Bite and his forces to Earth. Once on Earth they contact Grimlock to aid them.

In the &quot;Beast Wars Shattered Glass&quot; story arc the G1 Ultra Magnus travels to Shattered Glass prehistoric Earth with Prowl (Smilodon), Ironhide (Mumakil), Silverbolt (Harpagornis), and Grimlock (Spinosaurus). Adopting a Palaeoloxodon beast mode in order to survive the raw Energon radiation, he adopts the identity &quot;Ultra Mammoth&quot;, which he attributes to Grimlock. With their home universe destroyed, Mammoth and his team did battle with Megatron&#x27;s force of Decepticons, who had adopted alternative means of survival. Joined by an alternate version of Depth Charge, the former Autobots took on a new identity as Maximals. After a number of battles with Megatron&#x27;s similarly renamed Predacons, Ultra Magnus gained possession of the Origin Matrix.

Ultra Mammoth and his comrades eventually made their way to the present of the Shattered Glass Universe, their own universe having been destroyed by the actions of Magnus&#x27; Shattered Glass counterpart. While most of his crew chose to take on normal Cybertronian forms, Ultra Mammoth retained his beast form, and through the heroic Galvatron learned that the Matrix he carried was a component of the Star Saber. He resolved to keep it until Nexus Prime returned, only to run afoul of his alternate self and engage him in a battle. The conflict was soon interrupted by Nexus Prime&#x27;s arrival, and after sending the evil Magnus to another universe Nexus reclaimed the Matrix and resolved to use the Star Saber and Terminus Blade-the latter being reclaimed from Magnus-to prevent any other universes from suffering the same fate as Ultra Mammoth&#x27;s.

===Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing===
Ultra Magnus would make another appearance in the second G. I Joe vs. the Transformers crossover from Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing, again as one of the leaders of the Autobot resistance to Shockwave. He and Perceptor saved a group of G. I Joes and Cobras from Shockwave&#x27;s Decepticons, erecting a force field to protect them while they worked to repair the damage caused by Teletran-3, powered by Magnus&#x27; own strength. The shield eventually gave out and Magnus was captured. However, they were all rescued when the Dinobots returned and routed Shockwave&#x27;s forces.

He reappeared in the third crossover as part of the combined Autobot/G. I Joe force attempting to rescue Optimus Prime, and even held off Trypticon single-handedly at one point. In the fourth crossover, Magnus was left in charge of the Autobot forces on Cybertron when Optimus Prime journeyed to Earth.

===IDW Publishing===

In issue #3 of &quot;The Transformers: Megatron Origin&quot;, a white colored Transformer (resembling Magnus&#x27; Titanium War Within toy) is seen from behind at the funeral of Bumper and Fastback. Whether this is actually Magnus is unclear.

In the new IDW Publishing continuity Magnus is a feared Autobot law enforcement officer. Magnus tracked down all those who broke the accords - be they Autobot or Decepticon. After arresting the Decepticon weapons dealer Swindle, the unscrupulous Decepticon managed to talk his way out of it by offering Magnus an even more tempting prize - the whereabouts of Scorponok. Despite his own personal reservations about doing so, Magnus agreed (planting a tracker on Swindle in the process) and tracked Scorponok down on the planet Nebulos. There he discovered the Decepticon&#x27;s plan - upgrading several of the Nebulans with Transformer technology. Magnus soon found Scorponok himself and lost the subsequent fight. However, a shot from Scorponok&#x27;s beast mode seemingly killed Scorponok&#x27;s already upgraded partner Lord Zarak. Magnus managed to shoot Scorponok in the head, but the Decepticon escaped again. Much later, after apprehending Swindle (again), the Decepticon again attempted to deal his way out. He reappeared briefly again in the &quot;Spotlight&quot; issue on Arcee, where he tracked down, battled, and defeated the deranged Arcee, not realizing that the facility he was in was actually being used by Jhiaxus for the expansion.

Ultra Magnus also appears in the IDW ongoing series. He comes to Earth some three years after the events of the &quot;All Hail Megatron&quot; series, once again tracking Swindle. As acting Autobot commander, Bumblebee attempts to persuade Ultra Magnus to abandon his law enforcement duties and take up the fight against the Decepticons that still remained on Earth.

In &quot;The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye&quot;, Ultra Magnus serves as second-in-command of star ship the Lost Light under the command of Rodimus. Ultra Magnus being the &#x27;Duly Appointed Enforcer of the Tyrest Accord&#x27; is in charge of judging and accessing the moral and ethical standing of the Lost Light&#x27;s Crew. His initial role on the Lost Light, typified in his educating of Tailgate regarding the &#x27;Autobot Code&#x27; &quot;[Liking] to go through the code word by word, line by line, teasing out the implications&quot; The crew of the Lost Light perceive Ultra Magnus as stringently stoic, &quot;[Taking his] job and everything else extremely seriously&quot;, only ever &quot;Smiling once and regretting it ever since.&quot; In Volume 15 Ultra Magnus is impaled at the hands of Overlord, presumed dead by the crew of the Lost Light. However, in the aftermath of their battle with Overlord, the crew go to collect the corpse of Ultra Magnus, only to find that it has inexplicably disappeared. It is then revealed that Ultra Magnus is an identity partially created by Chief Justice Tyrest; when the original Ultra Magnus died, Tyrest created a suit replicating Magnus&#x27; armour for an Autobot to wear, thus continuing the identity of Ultra Magnus to serve as the duly appointed enforcer of the Tyrest Accord long after the original&#x27;s death. The current holder of the Magnus Armor is Minimus Ambus, which is revealed in the &quot;Remain In Light&quot; story arc. Ultra Magnus, along with other members of the Lost Light who were double crossed by Getaway and laid in place a coup which ousted any members which befriended the now Autobot aligned Megatron. In &#x27;Transformers &quot;More Than Meets The Eye&#x27;s&#x27; second part &#x27;The Lost Light&quot;&#x27;, Ultra Magnus along with the other ousted Lost Light Survivors find themselves on a revenge mission to get back the Lost Light and take down Getaway. In this chapter Minimus Ambus learns to grow more comfortable outside of the Magnus Armor.

=== Minimus Ambus ===
The Character of Minimus Ambus first appeared in IDW Publishing’s, ‘Transformers - More Than Meets The Eye’ Issue 18 and is first introduced as a prison in Luna 1, stating that he was “- a trader of, derivatives and was consequently arrested by Ultra Magnus and sentenced to a thousand years within a prison on Luna 1 by Chief Justice Tyrest. However the façade of Minimus Ambus is uncovered by Rung wherein, the aforementioned picks up on the “Pattern of [Minimus’] speech, his mannerisms, the intonation in his voice -” on top of the fact “The whole cell [was] filthy, apart from where [Minimus] was sitting” - “and the fact that [Minimus had] been staring at [Rung’s] chest ever since he put his badge on at an angle.” To which Minimus reluctantly reveals himself to be Ultra Magnus. Not long after, it’s revealed that Minimus Ambus is the most recent in a line of Ultra Magnus’, that after his death, Chief Justice Tyrest believed that the perpetuation of Ultra Magnus was crucial for justice and law within Cybertronian culture; “People [loving] and fearing him in equal and [this] fascinated Chief Justice Tyrest.”, leading Chief Justice Tyrest to develop the ‘Magnus Armour’; “An opportunity to create the Immortal Lawman.” Minimus Ambus reveals that he is what is referred to as a &#x27;Loadbearer&#x27; a form of &#x27;Point One Percenter&#x27; which allows him to bare &#x27;Fully Integrated Neuroware&#x27; unlike most other Cybertronians which have a “Low Breaking Strain”. By the end of the volume, Minimus goes against his role to uphold and enforce the &#x27;Tryest Accord&#x27;, inferredly killing Chief Justice Tyrest in order to save the ‘Crew of The Lost Light’ and stop Tyrest’s ‘Kill Switch&#x27; . Minimus Ambus proceeds to go on with the Crew of the Lost Light for the remainder of the series, though readorning the Ultra Magnus armour and primarily being referred to as Ultra Magnus.

===Binaltech===
In the altered chronology of the &quot;Binaltech&quot; saga, Optimus Prime is still alive, having never had the final showdown with Megatron at the Battle of Autobot City. When Ravage arranges for the Autobots to be alone in the battle against the threat of Unicron, Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus team up to take on the planet-eater, having discovered that the Matrix is the key to Unicron&#x27;s destruction. Within Unicron&#x27;s body, Optimus Prime is severely damaged, and although not fatally, he passes the Matrix to Ultra Magnus to complete the mission. Ultra Magnus sheds his outer armor and proceeds on, successfully opening the Matrix and initiating the destruction of Unicron. Magnus and Prime escape the exploding giant.

===Other appearances===
Ultra Magnus is the main character in the Famicom video game &quot;&quot;. The game is a typical side-scroller in which he battles Decepticons. This game has been poorly received.

Ultra Magnus appears among the Transformers box art on the back of larger third-year Transformers toys. He is flying in robot mode without his armor. For many years this was his only depiction in non-armored mode.

===Toys===
*&quot;Generation 1&quot; Ultra Magnus (1986)
:Based on the Diaclone toy similar to Optimus Prime, Powered Convoy. Despite the fact that this toy has a smaller robot identical to &quot;Optimus Prime&quot; that can combine with the trailer for a super robot, he was only depicted in super mode in the animated series and Marvel comics. According to the U.S. patent for this toy, the head and chest plate of the super robot mode combine to form a jet with a gun turret on it. Several variations of this toy were released, with varying amounts of paint applications and with rubber or plastic tires on his trailer.
:Like many previous &quot;Transformers&quot; toys, the Ultra Magnus toy was a carry-over from the Japanese &quot;Diaclone&quot; line, where it was released in silver, red, and dark blue colors as &quot;Powered Convoy,&quot; a powered-up version of &quot;Battle Convoy,&quot; the toy which had become &quot;Optimus Prime&quot;, hence the identical cabs. Additionally, the Diaclone toy&#x27;s instructions included several more alternate modes the toy could be configured into, which were omitted from Ultra Magnus&#x27;s instructions in the US release. In the Japanese release of the Ultra Magnus character, however, two of these additional modes are kept, while the third (a battle station) is replaced with another battle station mode with a completely different arrangement.
:It is worth noting that Powered Convoy&#x27;s original colors may have at one point been intended to be kept for the Ultra Magnus character -- an early promotional film advertising &quot;Transformers: The Movie&quot; features Ultra Magnus animated in these hues. In line with this, when the original Ultra Magnus toy was re-issued in Japan in 2000, a limited-edition version in the &quot;Diaclone&quot; colors was also released, referred to as a &quot;Movie Edition&quot;; this deco would later be used as the basis for a comics-exclusive character named Delta Magnus. A third version also saw release, cast entirely in translucent yellow, intended to represent the moment that Magnus is caught in the light of the Matrix.
:Ultra Magnus&#x27; toy consists of a smaller robot, identical to Optimus Prime but with a mostly white coloration, which acts as the cab of the car carrier and combines with the trailer to form the familiar Ultra Magnus as depicted in the cartoon and comics. The white &quot;inner robot&quot; would not appear in official fiction until the publication of the Dreamwave comics, but was alluded to by the coating applied to Optimus Prime in &quot;The Return Of Optimus Prime&quot;.

*&quot;Generation 1&quot; Kabaya Gum Ultra Magnus (1986)
:Part of the original gum toy series by Kabaya. Each package comes with a stick of chewing gum and an easy-to-assemble kit. The completed robot looks and transforms almost the same as the larger, original Takara version. The car carrier can accommodate Mini-Car figures (Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, etc.) and most &quot;World&#x27;s Smallest Transformers&quot; figures.

*&quot;Generation 2&quot; Ultra Magnus (1993)
:A collectable watch that looked like Ultra Magnus&#x27; super robot mode was released in Generation 2

*&quot;Generation 1&quot; Reissue Ultra Magnus (2002)
:The reissue of Ultra Magnus in 2002 had elongated missiles and shortened smokestacks to comply with new child safety laws.

*&quot;Universe&quot; Deluxe Ultra Magnus with Over-Run (2004)
:The toy for this version of Ultra Magnus is a white recolor of the Armada Deluxe Optimus Prime and Over-Run toy. There was an error in the assembly of the toy where the lower parts of his arms were swapped with each other, meaning he could not bend his arms up at the elbows fully unless they are fixed.

*&quot;Masterpiece&quot; MP-02 Ultra Magnus (2005)
:A white redeco of &quot;Masterpiece&quot; Optimus Prime that comes with a Megatron in gun mode, Energon axe, and the Matrix of Leadership.

*&quot;Generation 2&quot; Laser Ultra Magnus (2006)
:When the &quot;Generation 2&quot; Laser Optimus Prime figure was reissued in Japan in 2006, online retailer eHobby offered an exclusive repainted version of it as a new version of the original Ultra Magnus, referencing - as other toylines had also since done - the connection between the original Prime and Magnus toys. As a repaint of Laser Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus has light-up eyes and headlights, and a sword and gun which can also be illuminated when placed in his fist. His trailer can, via a spring-loaded mechanism, transform into a heavily armed battle station with a five-shot missile launcher, disc shooter, and bellows-activated foam-tipped rocket launcher.
:The extensive bio for this toy reveals that after Magnus lost his life in a Decepticon attack, he was welcomed into the Allspark, his spark retaining its individuality like the other ancient Autobot leaders due to his brief ownership of the Matrix of Leadership. Magnus, however, did not feel that he truly belonged there, and, through the cosmic awareness that comes with being part of the Matrix, learned that Galvatron II was threatening the galaxy. Making contact with Optimus Prime&#x27;s consciousness, Magnus used the power of Prime&#x27;s &quot;Reconfiguration Matrix&quot; - the means by which Prime had adopted numerous body forms in the G2 line - to bring about his own resurrection. With the power of the Reconfiguration Matrix, Magnus is able to adopt several different forms of his own, including his original body, but has selected a duplicate version of Prime&#x27;s &quot;Laser Rod&quot; form for particularly comprehensive offensive power.

*&quot;Classics&quot; Ultra Magnus (2007)
:A two pack of Ultra Magnus (repaint of Classics Voyager Optimus Prime) and Skywarp (repaint of Classics Deluxe Starscream) made a Target Store exclusive. The pack was sold under the name &quot;Battle for Autobot City&quot;.
:A later released 2-pack included Classic Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.

*&quot;Titanium&quot; 6 inch War Within Ultra Magnus (2007)
:Two different toys of Ultra Magnus appeared in the Titanium line. The first is a repaint of the 6&quot; inch War Within Optimus Prime in white colors.

*&quot;Titanium&quot; 6 inch Generation 1 Ultra Magnus (2007)
:The second is a new 6&quot; inch Titanium transforming mold which resembles his Generation 1 form. Only features vehicle and super-robot modes, with no separate smaller robot mode, as the trailer does not disconnect from the cab.

*Convoy feat. Nike Free 7.0 Ultra Magnus (2007)
:A special repaint of the Optimus Prime from the &quot;Transformers: Sports Label&quot; series in Ultra Magnus&#x27; colors were released. However, it was still packaged under the name Convoy and is therefore still identified as a version of Optimus Prime.

*&quot;Alternity&quot; Ultra Magnus Featuring Nissan GT-R (2010)
:An eHobby exclusive (Japan) and TF China Carnival (China) exclusive white redeco of the &quot;Alternity&quot; Convoy figure.

*&quot;Generation 1&quot; Kabaya Gum 25th Anniversary Ultra Magnus (2010)
:The 25th-anniversary gum toy is not a reissue of the original 1985 toy; instead, it appears to be based on the &quot;Titanium&quot; design.

*&quot;Timelines&quot; Ultra Mammoth (2013)
:A TFCC exclusive repaint of Big Convoy with a color scheme based on G1 Ultra Magnus.

==&quot;Transformers: Robots in Disguise&quot;==

The first new character to bear the name of Ultra Magnus since the Generation 1 original was known as God Magnus in the Japanese 2000 line, &quot;Transformers: Car Robots&quot;. God Magnus owed his name and alternate mode to Ultra Magnus (and also to Godbomber, an earlier character who disassembled to form armor for his Prime-styled partner), so when the series was translated for release in the West in 2001 as &quot;&quot;, the name change was obvious, and Ultra Magnus returned to TV screens for the first time since the G1 series. Later, a smaller &quot;Spy Changer&quot; figure of Magnus, unique to &quot;Robots in Disguise,&quot; was released

Ultra Magnus transforms into a car carrier capable of transporting other Autobots such as the Autobot Brothers. In addition to his remarkable strength and fighting ability, he is armed with the &quot;Blue Bolts&quot; - a variable-configuration weapon of immense destructive power. His weapon can either fire as a rapid-fire gun or as a high-powered laser. His back-mounted jetpack allows for periods of the short flight. In addition to these new abilities, for the first time, was able to combine with Optimus Prime (Robots In Disguise toyline) forming Omega Prime.

=== Animated series ===
As a nod to their origins in &quot;Generation 1&quot; Ultra Magnus and Optimus Prime (&quot;Fire Convoy&quot; in Japan) were created at the same time by Alpha Trion, but when Prime was chosen to carry the Matrix by Vector Sigma, Magnus felt passed over, jealous and was left carrying a hatred against his brother. That grudge eventually exploded into violence when he arrived on Earth with the intention of taking what he believed was rightfully his - by force, if necessary. Before meeting up with Optimus, Magnus fought and easily defeated the Decepticons on his own (not even Ruination could beat him). When he met Optimus, he offered Magnus a chance to join him, but Magnus outright refused and attacked him. Severely injuring Prime, who refused to fight back, Magnus tracked him to a desert island, where he pretended to offer him the hand of friendship, only to attempt to absorb the Matrix for himself, forcing the brothers into the combined form of Omega Prime &quot;(God Fire Convoy)&quot;. Through this link, Magnus was also able to channel the power of the Matrix, which he used to supercharge the Autobot Brothers into newly colored forms. Although Magnus remained a free agent, refusing to take orders from his brother, his animosity dwindled, and he frequently helped the Autobots by combining with Prime to battle the Predacons and Decepticons. As Omega Prime, they faced Galvatron together at the Earth&#x27;s core and defeated him once and for all.

Note that in &quot;Car Robots&quot;, there is not one singular Matrix, but multiple ones, each held by a high-ranking Autobot. Magnus already possesses a Matrix, and simply seeks to steal the power of Prime&#x27;s to increase his own (the overspill resulting in the supercharging of the Autobot Brothers).

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
The character also made one appearance in Dreamwave Productions&#x27; Summer Special in a story presented as being in continuity with the animated series, which pitted him against Scourge, as both denied and debated their Autobot heritage and relation to Optimus Prime. No further &quot;RiD&quot; stories were published by Dreamwave before their closure, as &quot;Beast Wars&quot; claimed victory over &quot;RiD&quot; in a poll to choose the next mini-series.

===3H Enterprises===
Three versions of Ultra Magnus would appear in the BotCon exclusive &quot;Transformers: Universe&quot; storyline.

Although the &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; incarnation of Ultra Magnus did not return to TV screens, his toy was re-released on the shelves of Sam&#x27;s Club in 2003&#x27;s parallel-universe-spanning &quot;Transformers: Universe&quot; line, slightly redecorated with bluish-black parts in place of his dark blue ones. Featured in the pages of the &quot;Transformers: Universe&quot; comic book exclusive to the Official Transformers Collectors Convention, this character was established to the &quot;RiD&quot; Magnus, who, along with Optimus Prime, was plucked from his home universe at a point after the conclusion of &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; to become part of a battle between armies gathered from across space and time by Unicron and Primus. Led by Optimus Primal into the final battle, the combatants found their conflict halted when Unicron began to crumble beneath them. Primal&#x27;s team gathered together to escape through a portal, but when Magnus and Prime passed through, they did not find themselves where they expected...

In another universe, an Autobot bearing a great physical resemblance to Ultra Magnus called Ultra Trion appeared, being killed by the Decepticon leader Megazarak. According to series artist Dan Khanna in a message board response, Ultra Trion was meant to be an alternate universe counterpart to Ultra Magnus, who acted as Alpha Trion&#x27;s successor until his demise. Ultra Trion was later retconned into being a version of Ultra Magnus, who merged with a dying Alpha Trion in an alternate future version of a &quot;Robot in Disguise&quot; universe, where Cybertron is ruled by Megazarak and the Autobots are near-extinct.

Yet another version of Ultra Magnus appeared, in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play, and this character was seemingly yet another new Ultra Magnus taken from a parallel dimension to that of the &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; fiction. The toy for this version of Ultra Magnus is a recolor of the &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; toy and came packaged with Ironhide. This package was a Walmart store exclusive in 2004. The Voice Actor Drama was written for OFTCC 2004 by Simon Furman, set after the events in the comics. Spy Changers Optimus Prime, Prowl, Ultra Magnus, and Ironhide were among those taken from their world via teleportation beam by Unicron and his Decepticon minions. The Autobot forces opposing Unicron attempted to deflect the beam, which left them all trapped on an uninhabited ice-world. The Autobot forces teamed up to overcome the Decepticons led by Reptilion. Presumably, the Autobots were then returned to their own worlds.

===Fun Publications===
Prime and Magnus&#x27;s toys were released once more in 2005&#x27;s &quot;&quot; - exclusively to Costco, with Magnus&#x27;s toy remaining unchanged from his &quot;Universe&quot; redeco - with bios which once again presented them to be the same characters from &quot;RiD&quot; and &quot;Universe&quot;. It was within the pages of the &quot;Cybertron&quot; comic available through the Official Transformers Collectors Club that the story was continued, as the portal through which Magnus and Prime had vanished in &quot;Universe&quot; transported them into the &quot;Cybertron&quot; universe; there, a black hole left in the wake of Unicron&#x27;s destruction in that universe had caused multiversal ripples which had resulted in the collapse of Unicron in the &quot;Universe&quot; timeline the brothers had just departed, and materialized on Cybertron...

In the &quot;Cybertron&quot; universe, Cybertron was under attack by two of the Heralds of Unicron, Nemesis Prime and Ramjet. They had already damaged Alpha Trion, and while Ramjet engaged Vector Prime in a duel high above Cybertron, Nemesis Prime got past Sentinel Maximus and revealed his plan - he was going to use the Dead Matrix, a corrupted version of the Matrix of Leadership, to drain the lifeforce of Primus and use it to revive Unicron (destroyed in a black hole at the conclusion of ). But he was confronted by the most unexpected foe of all - Omega Prime. Omega then split into Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus, and while Prime attended to Primus, Magnus defeated Nemesis Prime. Informing Sentinel Maximus of what went on, they then stored the Dead Matrix away forever, unaware they were being observed by Soundwave.

Soundwave subsequently stole the Dead Matrix and threw it into the black hole, reviving Unicron, who took a nearby planet as his new body. Unicron attacked Cybertron again in the midst of a Mini-Con civil war, dueling with Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime. The battle was inconclusive, but Unicron was driven away by Primus himself. The brothers recovered - only to receive Optimus Prime, bearing word of Vector Prime&#x27;s death in battle. Prime and Magnus were subsequently seen planning the hunt for Unicron.

=== Toys ===
A God Magnus Leader Class figure was released in 2000, which transforms from car carrier to robot. In-car carrier mode, he can hold up to three Deluxe-sized cars (most notably the Car Brothers from the &quot;Car Robots&quot; series). His main weapon fires spring-loaded missiles and can fold into three different configurations. This battery-operated figure features truck horn sounds, weapons sound effects, and voice samples of God Magnus. Combines with Fire Convoy (sold separately) to form God Fire Convoy. Once combined, God Fire Convoy emits different sound effects and voice clips (&quot;&quot;Chou-Kyoudai Gattai!&quot; God Fire Convoy!&quot; and &quot;God Fire!&quot;). A Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Japan exclusive gift set was offered in late 2000, featuring God Magnus and Super Fire Convoy packaged with the God Sword (a repaint of the sword from the Japanese G1 Fortress Maximus).

Its American counterpart, &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; Leader Ultra Magnus, was originally released in 2001. It is similar to the Japanese release, only with the Japanese voice replaced with the English voice (with the phrase, &quot;Ultra Magnus, Transform!&quot;). Autobot emblems have been placed on the side panels in this version. Much like the Japanese version, this figure combines with Optimus Prime&#x27;s normal robot mode to form Omega Prime, with a different set of voice and sound clips (&quot;Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Combine!&quot; and &quot;Omega Fire!&quot;).

A &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; Spy Changer Ultra Magnus was released in 2002. The Spy Changer of Ultra Magnus was repainted as the Dairycon 2002 exclusive figure Campaign Car.

==&quot;Transformers: Energon&quot;==

It was in the second installment of the Unicron trilogy, &quot;&quot;, that the Overload toy was repainted into Ultra Magnus&#x27;s blue, white and red colors and released in the west under the name &quot;Ultra Magnus&quot; in a limited production run.

The &quot;Energon&quot; version of Ultra Magnus, like all the recolorations of Armada toys featured in the early stages of the toyline, never appeared in the TV show or the Dreamwave comic.

The &quot;Transformers: Energon&quot; Ultra Magnus figure features a smaller mini-con figure named &quot;Knock Out&quot; that transforms and combines with a larger robot action figure that transforms into a trailer. When the 2 figures merge together, They become the &quot;Energon&quot; version of &quot;Ultra Magnus&quot;

Although &quot;Transformers: Cybertron&quot;, the third installment of the &quot;Unicron Trilogy&quot; timeline, saw &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; Magnus enter its timeline, it was not without its own characters bearing the name. The &quot;&quot; toyline was the first to re-use Magnus&#x27; name, although not in the west - in Japan, where the character known as Overload in English was named Ultra Magnus. It was not an ill-fitting name, as the first, unpainted pictures of the toy had caused speculation that it was intended to &quot;be&quot; a new version of Magnus, bearing as it does his stylistic shoulder design.

===Fun Publications===
Ultra Magnus appeared in the text story from Fun Publications called &quot;&quot;. This story explained where he was during the events of the &quot;Cybertron&quot; story. Ultra Magnus is commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search of the Cyber Planet Keys. He also serves as captain of the Iron Hope which was crewed by Bonecrusher, Grimlock, Ironhide, Knock Out, Overcast, Prowl, Quickstrike, RipTide, Skyblast, Smokescreen, Swoop, Wreckage and the Sky Scorcher Mini-Con Team.

&quot;Ask Vector Prime&quot; later revealed that Ultra Magnus previous possessed a form similar to Optimus Prime&#x27;s, but that he was rebuilt using the schematics of Overload after being badly damaged in battle with Treadshot.

===Toys===
This version of Ultra Magnus is a recolor of &quot;Armada&quot; Overload. It was released in 2004 and came with a recolor of the &quot;Armada&quot; Space Mini-Con team. The &quot;Transformers: Universe&quot; white and blue repaint of &quot;Armada&quot; Optimus Prime designated Ultra Magnus was also incorporated into this version of the character.
==&quot;Transformers: Animated&quot;==

In the Cartoon Network series &quot;&quot;, Ultra Magnus serves as the Autobot commander on Cybertron and Optimus Prime&#x27;s superior and father figure, he believes Optimus has the potential to be a born leader, despite being kicked out of Autobot Academy. His head resembles that of the Generation 1 character&#x27;s super robot mode. He wields a large war hammer called the Magnus Hammer, which can discharge massive amounts of electricity and command lightning bolts. He turns into an 8-wheeled missile launcher truck. In doing Ultra Magnus&#x27; voice, Jeff Bennett emulates the voice of Robert Stack, who voiced Magnus in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;.

===Animated series===
Ultra Magnus is the incumbent Supreme Commander of the Autobots and led his faction through the Great War with the Decepticons. During the war, Ultra Magnus commissioned Project Omega as a desperate measure to defeat the Decepticons, despite his regret that the Autobots were creating a series of living doomsday weapons. After Ultra Magnus led the Autobots to victory, the Decepticons were exiled from Cybertron, leaving the planet at peace. Ultra Magnus later regretfully expelled Optimus from the Autobot Elite Guard after he assumed responsibility for the apparent death of Elita-1. However, due to liking Optimus and suspecting that Sentinel was not telling the whole truth of the incident, he promoted him to Optimus Prime and gave him command of the stasis-locked Omega Supreme.

In the pilot of &quot;Transformers: Animated&quot; Ultra Magnus learned that Optimus Prime and his crew had discovered the Allspark and ordered them to stay put until it could be retrieved. He also told Prime not to try to be a hero; unfortunately, Optimus disobeyed and had the ship take off anyway, stating that &quot;&quot;Ultra Magnus&quot; wasn&#x27;t carrying the Allspark&quot;. Ultra Magnus comes to Earth personally in the episode &quot;The Elite Guard&quot; with his fellow Cybertron Elite Guard members Sentinel Prime and Jazz. He took on an Earth-vehicle mode. After the battle against some out-of-control police droids and a fragment of the Allspark was retrieved, Ultra Magnus began to respect Optimus Prime as a commander and told Sentinel Prime that he can learn a thing or two from him. During &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;, he informs Optimus and his crew to pack up and get ready to head back to Cybertron, believing that Optimus is emboldening the Decepticons with his shaky claims Megatron&#x27;s return. Ultra Magnus is convinced of the Decepticon presence on Earth by a battle with Starscream and departs to deal with Decepticon attacks on Autobot space bridges, entrusting Optimus&#x27; crew with the protection of Earth.

In &quot;TransWarped&quot;, Ultra Magnus realizes that the uprisings were too organized and deduced that Cybertron may have a double agent. He then sends Sentinel and Jazz to Earth to get an update from the Earthbound Autobots. In &quot;Where Is Thy Sting?&quot;, Longarm Prime (Shockwave) is outed as the traitor, and Magnus is savagely attacked and barely able to reveal the identity of his attacker to Ironhide. According to Alpha Trion in &quot;Decepticon Air&quot;, Ultra Magnus is currently on &quot;spark-support&quot;. By this time, Sentinel Prime takes over as the new Magnus. In &quot;This Is Why I Hate Machines&quot;, the attack by Shockwave and the image of Ultra Magnus in the infirmary are used as propaganda in Sentinel&#x27;s fanatical government policies. While on spark-support, Ultra Magnus is nearly destroyed by his own hammer when Shockwave attacks the infirmary but is saved by Ratchet, who takes the hammer with him to Earth and promises to return it once Ultra Magnus recovers.

For a time, Ultra Magnus&#x27;s ultimate fate was not revealed before the end of the series, but Derrick J. Wyatt stated that if a fourth season of the show was made, Magnus was to have died from his injuries.

===Toys===
The first toy for this version of Ultra Magnus was released in 2008 and transformed from a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck to the robot. He came with a spring-loaded Magnus Hammer and is armed with numerous guns mounted on his shoulders. The figure emits two sound effects and phrases as voiced by Jeff Bennett. This toy was later recolored in a green, black, and orange theme, in a homage to the &quot;Generation 1&quot; robot superhero Roadbuster. The version released in Japan in 2010 had metallic paint and Japanese voice clips.
==&quot;Transformers: Prime&quot;==

Ultra Magnus is the leader of the Wreckers, and Optimus Prime&#x27;s second-in-command. Like the &quot;Animated&quot; version of the character, this Ultra Magnus carries a hammer, in actuality a depleted Forge of Solus Prime, while like his IDW depiction, he is stern and takes no-nonsense.

===Animated Series===
Ultra Magnus appears in the third season of &quot;&quot;, entitled &quot;Beast Hunters&quot;. He is revealed to be Optimus Prime&#x27;s second-in-command, who survived the war for Cybertron. He is a by-the-book commander, requesting that the subordinate Autobots, with the exception of Ratchet, and even the humans address him as &quot;sir&quot;.

Though he is not mentioned by name prior to his arrival, his image-or a very similar one-appeared when the amnesiac Optimus Prime, then going by Orion Pax, looked up Optimus Prime in the Decepticon database. Ultra Magnus himself arrives on Earth in &quot;Scattered&quot; and meets with Arcee and Jack. Like Wheeljack, he has his own personal vessel, though he is a good deal larger.

In &quot;Prey,&quot; Ultra Magnus tells Jack and Arcee that he detected five Autobot life signatures that remained online. Ultra Magnus also mentioned that he had encountered other Autobots during his travels, many of which perished in Decepticon attacks. Later, he helps Bulkhead, Wheeljack and Miko escape from the Predacon named Predaking before finding Ratchet, Bumblebee, and Raf at the Harbinger and meeting Agent Fowler and June Darby. Ultra Magnus decides that the Autobots must defeat Megatron once and for all and, after taking command, offers them a large supply of weapons to assist in the fight.

In &quot;Rebellion&quot;, Ultra Magnus leads the assault on Darkmount, where Predaking is sent through a Ground Bridge into the Antarctic. Magnus goes after Megatron but is defeated. Before the Autobots can be executed, a recently repaired Optimus Prime arrives and destroys Darkmount. Later, Magnus gives Optimus command over the Autobots again.

In &quot;Project Predacon&quot;, Ultra Magnus&#x27; vehicle form is revealed, a nearly all-blue version of Optimus&#x27; semi-truck form. It is also revealed that he had been put in charge of the Wreckers back on Cybertron during the war, as he felt there needed to be someone to keep them in order. Once again taking charge of the Wreckers on Earth, Ultra Magnus also takes the Forge of Solus Prime as a new weapon, as it had no more power and he wanted to give it a &quot;practical use&quot;.

In &quot;Chain of Command&quot;, Ultra Magnus constantly criticizes Wheeljack&#x27;s actions, such as attacking without orders and bringing Miko along. It is revealed that Ultra Magnus becoming the leader of the Wreckers was the reason that Wheeljack deserted. When fighting Predaking in the mine and losing, Magnus once again criticizes Wheeljack for detonating a grenade in a confined space. Ultimately Wheeljack deserts the Wreckers once again, though he returns to the Autobot base back in Nevada. This is shown in the episode &quot;Plus One&quot;, in which Ultra Magnus, Bulkhead, and Miko return to Nevada in Magnus&#x27; ship instead of by ground bridge, bringing with them the reclaimed Apex Armor.

In &quot;Evolution&quot;, Ultra Magnus begins to realize that the Autobots aren&#x27;t very welcoming towards him, not just Wheeljack. He turns to Optimus, the only one who doesn&#x27;t treat him the same way, for advice, but the conversation is interrupted by a mission to what is believed to be a Decepticon Energon mine, and he takes the Wreckers inside of the mine with Smokescreen. He and Wheeljack stumble upon Shockwave&#x27;s Predacon cloning lab and proceed to battle him, but Shockwave escapes and the Predacons begin to awaken. Wheeljack detonates a grenade next to the synthetic Energon, and they attempt to make their escape, just as Predaking arrives. Predaking is enraged by the loss of his Predacon brethren and tries to kill the two Autobots. The Wreckers put up more of a fight against Predaking in his robot mode, but eventually are defeated. Predaking crushes Magnus&#x27;s hand by stepping on it and destroys the Forge of Solus Prime. When he is about to kill them, Optimus Prime comes in and saves them both. Magnus is later being treated by Ratchet, and Optimus answers his earlier question, explaining that the bond of family is greater than that of any army.

Ultra Magnus continues to work the Autobots, with a metal claw as a replacement for his destroyed hand. He leads the Wreckers in the final battle against the Decepticons in &quot;Deadlock&quot;, until the Decepticons are defeated upon the death of Megatron, and witnesses the revival of Cybertron through the use of the Omega Lock.

In the TV movie, &quot;Predacons Rising&quot;, Ultra Magnus is left in command while Optimus goes to retrieve the Allspark. When investigating the Sea of Rust with Smokescreen, they come across two Predacons, Skylynx and Darksteel. Magnus tries to fight off Skylynx, but is brutally beaten by him, and barely escapes with Smokescreen&#x27;s help. He spends the rest of the movie under Ratchet&#x27;s medical attention. He is however seen, still on a medical chair, when Optimus sacrifices himself for Cybertron&#x27;s restoration with the AllSpark.

He and many others made a cameo in Robots in Disguise.

===Books===
Ultra Magnus appears in the novel &quot;&quot;, its sequel, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, the third installment in the series. Unlike the animated series, the Wreckers form around Ultra Magnus, who becomes a leading figure amongst the early Autobots. Wielding a powerful hammer, Magnus eventually became leader of the Autobot resistance to Shockwave on Cybertron following the departure of the &quot;Ark&quot; and the &quot;Nemesis.&quot; Ultra Magnus and his team played a role in the &quot;Ark&#x27;s&quot; successful departure, delaying Trypticon and the Decepticons long enough for the &quot;Ark&quot; to be launched. He then takes up leadership of the Autobot forces resisting Shockwave&#x27;s domination of the planet, corresponding with Alpha Trion and leading his Wreckers into battle against the enemy. In &quot;Retribution&quot; his role is expanded when Alpha Trion is taken prisoner by Shockwave and experimented upon, prompting him to assemble several Wreckers along with Jetfire and Omega Supreme to liberate the captured Prime. Their plan would be further complicated by an invasion of Sharkticons sent by the Quintessons to reclaim Cybertron, but they eventually escaped with the aid of the bar owner Maccadam.

===IDW Publishing===
Ultra Magnus also appeared in the &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot; comic mini-series, &quot;Rage of the Dinobots&quot;. Like many Autobots, he developed something of an aversion to the Dinobots due to their altered nature. Due to his rigid personality, he also looked unfavorably upon their combat tactics. However, after they played a significant role in enabling him to depart Cybertron, Magnus came to respect the Dinobots as comrades.

Ultra Magnus makes a cameo, along with Arcee and Bulkhead, in the &quot;Transformers: Robots in Disguise&quot; comic, secretly observing Bumblebee and his team fight a Decepticon bird named Flamefeather. He along with Arcee and Bulkhead meet Team Bee during a conflict with Clipshade in issue 2

===Games===
Ultra Magnus appears as a character in the Nintendo DS game &quot; - Autobots&quot;. He is a level boss that must be defeated, which unlocks him as a playable character. He is also available in the Decepticons version of the game. If the sewer level with Motormaster is played with Autobot characters, Ultra Magnus is used to replacing Motormaster.

Ultra Magnus is available as downloadable content for &quot;&quot;.

==Transformers: Timelines (Shattered Glass)==

Ultra Magnus is one of the evil Autobots in Fun Publications&#x27; &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; universe. In this universe, he is also Optimus Prime&#x27;s younger brother, and formerly one of the chief lieutenants in the Autobot dictatorship.

===Fun Publications===
However, he eventually staged a failed coup against Prime and had his face ripped away for his trouble, leaving him with a skeletal visage. Exiled to Paradron, he eventually formed an alliance with Wreck-Gar and others, obtaining the Omega Blade and copying Optimus&#x27;s latest form in preparation to make another grab for power. This would lead to an invasion of the Classics universe, which was eventually destroyed as a result of Magnus&#x27; actions while its version of Earth was transported to Magnus&#x27; home universe. This would subsequently be revealed to be part of a scheme to harvest the energy of destroyed universes and use it against Optimus, but Magnus ran into unexpected opposition when his counterpart from the universe he destroyed, now known as Ultra Mammoth, engaged him and was exposed to a reaction of the Origin Matrix carried by him. This caused him to briefly go on a rampage until he was subdued by the arrival of Nexus Prime, who promptly claimed the Omega Blade for his own use. Magnus attempted to escape, but Nexus banished him into another reality and trapped him there before setting out to ensure that a plan such as his could never be employed again.

==Angry Birds Transformers==
Alongside Optimus Prime, The character Red plays Ultra Magnus as a playable character in Angry Birds Transformers.

<text>The following is a list of characters in the Archie Comics universe. Licensed characters like Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man are not included in this list.

==&quot;Archie&quot; series==

===Main characters===

====Archie Andrews====

The character Archie Andrews, created by John L. Goldwater, Bob Montana and Vic Bloom, first appeared in a humor strip in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 (December, 1941).

Within the context of the strip and the larger series that grew out of it, Archie is a typical teenage boy, attending high school, participating in sports, and dating. He is extremely kind, caring, brave and accident-prone and many of his actions, however well-intentioned, inadvertently harm the people he tries to help. He is not that academically inclined and brings home average grades. He is athletic and loves sports. He also has a love of cars and fixing them. He is also known for being easily infatuated by the many girls he meets. His never ending love triangle between Betty, the girl next door, and Veronica, the wealthy socialite, form the most common Archie stories. Archie’s other love interests include Cheryl Blossom and Valerie Smith of Josie and the Pussycats.

====Betty Cooper====

Betty is the kind-hearted, caring, talented, athletic, culinarily talented and intelligent girl next door. She is romantically obsessed with Archie but usually ends up playing second fiddle to her best friend and romantic rival Veronica Lodge. In some stories, Archie seems to prefer Betty over Veronica. She has a passion for writing and is a good student, detective and auto mechanic. She cares deeply for the well-being of others and is always ready to help people with their problems. She is the youngest child with two older siblings, an older sister named Polly and an older brother named Chic.

====Veronica Lodge====

Veronica (sometimes called Ronnie or Ron by her close friends) is a very rich girl, the daughter of the super wealthy multi-billionaire and business tycoon and industrialist Hiram Lodge. She is known to be the richest girl in Riverdale. She is a spendthrift, quite spoiled and vain, but is friendly, compassionate, caring, selfless, and generous. She gets along well with most of her classmates no matter their financial status. Like her best friend Betty, she is romantically obsessed with Archie and constantly competes for his affection, usually winning over Archie’s affections. She rarely gets along with Jughead Jones due to his lazy demeanor, though occasionally they set aside their differences, albeit usually to get Archie out of trouble.

====Jughead Jones====

Forsythe Pendleton &quot;Jughead&quot; Jones III, is Archie&#x27;s best friend since childhood. A slim boy with a huge appetite. Sarcastic, snarky and smart, Jughead is uninterested in girls. Despite this, he’s able to form friendships with girls, such as Betty. Jughead often bails Archie out of trouble when he acts impulsively and rashly. He almost always wears his trademark whoopee cap. He has a younger sister named Jellybean.

====Reggie Mantle====

Archie&#x27;s main rival, particularly for Veronica&#x27;s affections. Though they are ultimately good friends, he often taunts Archie and does not understand why girls prefer to date him. He is highly vain and conceited, thinks he can date anyone he wants, and expects everyone to think the world of him. He likes to pick on others, especially Jughead and Archie. He is always trying to get a date with Veronica but when they did date Veronica cheated on Reggie with Archie and he then dumps Veronica.

====Moose Mason====

Marmaduke &quot;Moose&quot; Mason is a muscular, handsome star athlete but is a poor student. He often says &quot;duh&quot; at the beginning of sentences, and is possessive about his girlfriend Midge. He also is known to be dyslexic. He is dimwitted and can be easily manipulated by others, particularly Reggie. He will beat up anyone (particularly Reggie) who upsets him or even talks to Midge, the latter being a point of friction between the couple. At the same time, he is also kind, sensitive and helpful toward his closest friends.

====Dilton Doiley====

A highly intelligent nerd and inventor. He gets A&#x27;s in every class except physical education and is the favorite student of most of his teachers, especially Professor Flutesnoot and Mr.Weatherbee. He is not especially interested in dating and is shy around girls, though he has shown interest in a few girls in the series, specially Betty Cooper whom he has a huge crush on. Despite his quirks, he fits in well with the gang, who often rely on his brains. He and Moose are best friends, despite their contrasting personalities.

====Midge Klump====

Moose&#x27;s girlfriend who is often frustrated with his jealousy and lack of intelligence but still loves him dearly. Boys cannot even talk to her without incurring Moose&#x27;s wrath. In reality however, she does not often show interest in other boys. Reggie is particularly attracted to her.

====Ethel Muggs====

A tall, stringy, somewhat dorky but goodhearted teenager who always tries to win over Jughead, albeit unsuccessfully. Portrayed as plain and gawky in appearance, she has many close friends and leads an active social life.

====Chuck Clayton====

Initially a shy loner, he came out as one of the most popular students in school. He is a very talented athlete and enjoys cartooning for fun. He has been a close friend of Archie&#x27;s since his introduction.

====Nancy Woods====

Chuck&#x27;s steady girlfriend. She does not take an interest in other boys, being devoted to Chuck alone. However, she is often annoyed with his paying more attention to his hobbies than her. Nancy enjoys sports, fashion, cheerleading and journalism, and is a close friend of the other girls.

==== Hiram Lodge ====

Veronica&#x27;s father, and the richest man in all of Riverdale. He&#x27;s a multi-billionaire and is one of the richest men in the world. Hiram is usually portrayed as being an industrialist and he&#x27;s the CEO of his multi-billionaire dollar company Lodge Industries. Hiram is a good, caring yet strict father towards Veronica. He often spoils her despite his attempts at trying to prevent Veronica from letting her wealth and privilege turn her into a typical spoiled rich kid. He always dreads meeting Archie due to Archie&#x27;s clumsiness and knack for causing him trouble. He tolerates Archie, however, because he knows of Archie&#x27;s more redeeming qualities, and allows his daughter to date whom she chooses.

====Mr. Waldo Weatherbee====

The school principal, popularly referred to as &#x27;The Bee&#x27;. A former United States Marine known for being obese and bald, he is often a victim of Archie&#x27;s clumsiness, which often puts the latter in detention. He is often, however, quite helpful and friendly to students.

====Miss Geraldine Grundy====
A teacher at Riverdale High. She is usually portrayed as an English teacher, though she is occasionally shown teaching other subjects. She is well-aged, slim with white hair, and her personality alternates between harsh and motherly. A younger version of Miss Grundy was portrayed by Sarah Habel in &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

An early version of Miss Grundy appears in &quot;Jackpot Comics&quot; #4 (Winter 1941). In this appearance, she is Mrs.Mimi Grundy, the married principal of Riverdale High School. She is reintroduced as &quot;Miss Grundy&quot; in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #30 (April 1942), the no-nonsense homeroom teacher at Riverdale High School, occasionally teaching English and math as well. Her name is derived from Mrs Grundy, a name that has been used to refer to a prudish woman since the early nineteenth century. Before she became a teacher, she worked at a pickle-packing plant. During World War II, she served with the WACs, outranking Mr. Weatherbee. Despite occasional grumblings from her students, they seem to genuinely like and admire her. She, in return, tends to drive them hard, pushing Archie Andrews and Moose Mason in particular, but remains quite fond of her students.

Her first name is most often given as Geraldine. However, at least once, another staff member called her &quot;Amanda&quot;. She was also called &quot;Alice&quot; in at least one mainstream story. In &quot;Archie&#x27;s Double Digest&quot; (#41), she was revealed to be an alumna herself of Riverdale High School, and had run for class president, in a joke about the need to clean off the bulletin board. Her forename was given as &quot;Elizabeth&quot; in &quot;The Archie and Sabrina Hour&quot;, as &quot;Geri&quot; in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot; books, and as &quot;Doris&quot; in the animated series &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;. In one story about Jughead Jones&#x27;s correct first name, it was revealed as &quot;Grisensnable&quot;. In an earlier Archie book that listed the names of the characters, her name was also &quot;Gertrude&quot;. Additionally, in the story &quot;Vive la France&quot; (first printed in &quot;Life with Archie&quot; #22), she signs the hotel registry book as &quot;Abigail&quot;. Nevertheless, Geraldine remains her commonly accepted name.

In &quot;Life with Archie: The Married Life&quot;, Miss Grundy and Mr.Weatherbee realized how much they loved each other, and got married. However, in this alternative future, she died from kidney disease not long afterward, leaving Mr.Weatherbee a broken-hearted widower.

In &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;, she and Mr.Weatherbee were chaperoning for the Halloween school dance. They took a break outside to reminisce about the time they snuck into the Cypress Cemetery as children and make references about &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. Their conversation is cut off at the appearance of a zombified Jughead who mauls Mr.Weatherbee. It is revealed Miss Grundy was turned into a zombie shortly afterwards. In &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;, Miss Grundy is the High Priestess of witch coven that Betty and Veronica are members of. She warned them against summoning a succubus to deal with their rivalry about Archie.

====In other media====
* Ms.Grundy appears in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;, where the episode &quot;Twisted Youth&quot; reveals her first name to be Doris, although the tie-in comics refer to her as Geraldine.
** Ms.Grundy is mentioned in the TV film &quot;The Archies in JugMan&quot;, where Archie notes that she loves to give pop quizzes.
* In &quot;Riverdale&quot;, Miss Grundy is a much younger woman played by Sarah Habel. In the fourth episode of the series it is revealed that Grundy moved to Riverdale after changing her name from Jennifer Gibson after her divorce, to escape from an abusive relationship. Since then Grundy has moved from Riverdale to avoid police capture because of her relationship with Archie. When Betty is searching for Miss Grundy online, she finds a Miss Grundy who died years prior to the beginning of the series, with her obituary picture closely resembling the Miss Grundy of the comic book series. In the season two premiere, it is revealed she is living in Greendale and &quot;teaching&quot; another young male student, before she is strangled to death by Black Hood with her own cello bow.

====Pop Tate====

Terry &quot;Pop&quot; Tate is the owner and manager of the Chok&#x27;lit Shoppe, an ice cream parlor and frequent hangout of Archie&#x27;s Gang. Pop Tate is the self-designated philanthropist for the Archie gang, hearing about their ups and downs while serving ice cream and an assortment of other tasty treats. He is a portly, thinning-haired, mustachioed gentleman who can seem gruff but is basically good-hearted. He is friends with Archie&#x27;s gang. He is proud of his culinary talent.

Jughead is Pop Tate&#x27;s best customer. Tate constantly talks about how Jughead&#x27;s appetite will provide for his retirement. Many stories reflect the fact that his customers, particularly Jughead, don&#x27;t always pay their tab. Jughead has been known to run his tab as long as possible, and put off paying it until Pop refuses any more credit.

In a comic centered on Pop, it was shown that he has a cousin named Russell, who runs a similar soda shop in the mountains. In the 2000s, his main rival was Segarini, the pizza parlor owner, a minor but recurring character.

Like many things in the Archie continuity, Pop Tate&#x27;s history has inconsistencies. In one installment of the series, it was revealed that Pop&#x27;s dad was the original &quot;Pops,&quot; while as a child he served at his side under the moniker &quot;Junior.&quot; But some stories say that Pop opened the business himself. In still another comic, he purchased it as a young man from the retiring owner McGurk. Some stories have given Pop&#x27;s real first name as Bob, Harold, Leo or Thomas, and in one story, it was given as Clark, but the official Archie Comics website gives his name as Terry. In the TV show “Riverdale,” the jolly dessertmaker’s proper name is given as Terence.

Pop&#x27;s shop has changed little over the years, and it still boasts a jukebox and old-time soda fountain. Attempts at times for Pop to &quot;modernize&quot; the shop have all failed; and Pop&#x27;s has retained its old-fashioned ice cream parlor atmosphere. This has allowed him to capitalize on nostalgia.

A fairly common plot is Pop Tate closing his shop and trying to sell it, which results in Archie and his friends scrambling to save it, generally by reminding everyone about the memories they have of the store, and telling them that losing the store would be horrible. One particular comic had the owner of the block giving an eviction notice to Pop to vacate the store in a week so he could build a 12-screen movie theater. As he and the gang go through stuff in the basement of the shop, they find enough evidence that the building is a historical landmark, which saves the shop and forces the land owner to build only a 6-screen theater.

The character of Pop Tate was inspired by the Greek immigrant owners of the three soda fountains frequented by Haverhill teenagers during the 1930s. These were the Crown Confectionery and the Chocolate Shop on Merrimack Street and the Tuscarora on Winter Street.

In the late 1930s, &quot;Archie&quot; creator Bob Montana joined other teens at the Chocolate Shop counter where he made sketches on napkins or in the diary-sketchbook he kept of Haverhill happenings. This material served as a source for Montana when he launched &quot;Archie&quot;.

Pop Tate has a recurring role in The CW&#x27;s &quot;Riverdale&quot;, played by Alvin Sanders.

====Kevin Keller====

The first openly gay character in Archie Comics. This fact earned him a great deal of attention in American comic media. He first appeared in Veronica #202. Veronica was deeply attracted to him, but was initially unaware of his sexuality, so Jughead took advantage of this situation to avenge himself against Veronica for humiliating him. Kevin&#x27;s sexuality is not presented as controversial or stereotypical in the comics, keeping with Archie Comics&#x27; image of accepting diversity and inclusion. Kevin is an aspiring journalist, with many hobbies including collecting comics and competitive eating. He has two younger sisters, his father is a retired Army Colonel and his mother is a housewife. Kevin&#x27;s closest friends in Riverdale are Veronica and Jughead, along with Wendy and William, friends from a previous school.

====Family members====

*Fred Andrews: Archie&#x27;s middle-class businessman father. Highly conservative and old-fashioned, he is frequently bothered by his son&#x27;s behavior, partly due to the generation gap. However, he and Archie have a number of common interests, and share many father/son activities. He has a pear-shaped build and is losing his hair.
*Mary Andrews: Archie&#x27;s typical all-American suburban mother who works for a real estate agency. She is more tolerant of Archie&#x27;s behavior than her husband, and is usually the only one who can maintain order in the house.
*Hermione Lodge: Veronica&#x27;s slender, white-haired mother and a wealthy patrician. She is often involved in charity work, and is a member of a number of ladies&#x27; social groups. She appears far less frequently than her husband, however, and rarely plays a significant role.
*Hubert Smithers: The bald, portly butler to the Lodge Mansion and the most frequently seen family servant. A running gag is how Archie annoys Smithers as much as he annoys Mr.Lodge, and Smithers takes great pleasure in throwing Archie out of the house. Despite his frustration with Archie&#x27;s clumsiness, he remains faithful to the Lodges.
*Gaston: The French cook for the Lodge family. Gaston is often still in Archie Comics today. He is often frustrated when Veronica tries to cook in &quot;his&quot; kitchen. 
*Hal Cooper: Betty&#x27;s middle-class but hard-working and civic-minded father who works as a druggist. Often frustrated by his daughter&#x27;s antics and perplexed by the female nature, he nevertheless supports Betty in whatever she does. He also introduced Betty to sports, and is proud of her.
*Alice Cooper: Betty&#x27;s caring, highly supportive mother who is a close friend of Mary Andrews and Hermione Lodge. They have a close mother/daughter bond, but she hopes that Betty will outgrow her tomboy phase.
*Polly and Charles Cooper: Betty&#x27;s older sister and older brother who debuted in the &quot;Little Archie&quot;, but later became part of the main continuity. Polly is a reporter in San Francisco and Chic is a secret agent for the government.
*Forsythe Pendleton Jones II: Jughead&#x27;s father, who looks just like his son, only older and balding. Sometimes he is portrayed just as lazy as his son is. As a teenager, he enjoyed sports, and wishes Jughead would take an interest in them too. Though he occasionally deals with money problems, he is a good provider for his family.
*Gladys Jones: Jughead&#x27;s mother. While she mainly stays home to take care of her daughter, she is, in reality, the hardest working member of her family, always trying to get her son to do his chores.
*Forsythia &quot;Jellybean&quot; Jones: Jughead&#x27;s little sister whose age varies from infant to preschooler depending on the story; she can sometimes manage simple words, and sometimes only speaks in thought bubbles. Despite her youth she knows whom to trust. Jellybean idolizes her brother, who devotes much of his time to babysitting and playing with her.
*Hot Dog: Jughead&#x27;s faithful pet dog, a mutt who resembles a sheepdog, who is sometimes a mascot for the gang. Capable of conscious thought, he behaves in rather human-like ways and often doesn’t consider himself a pet. He and Jughead have much in common, namely their appetites and laziness.
*Uncle Herman: Jughead’s Uncle Herman who always creates trouble for Jughead (and himself) when visiting.
*Souphead: Jughead’s cousin Souphead who looks like a mini version of Jughead.

===Faculty of Riverdale High School===

====Major recurring characters====
*Mr.Flutesnoot (Professor Elmer Benjamin Flutesnoot): A science teacher, usually chemistry, and also at times the band teacher (particularly in Little Archie) in whose face Archie&#x27;s chemistry experiments blow up. His favorite student is Dilton, due to Dilton&#x27;s high marks and passion for science, and the two frequently collaborate on projects.
*Coach Kleats: The head physical education teacher who loses his temper when things do not go his way. He first appeared in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #24. Atypically overweight for an athletic coach, he was a fantastic athlete when he was younger, and can play well to a certain extent. He mainly teaches baseball and American football and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of both. He is known to have unstable interpersonal relationships due to his irritability. He has a constant problem in getting the athletic best out of his students and sometimes considers Archie and Jughead inadequate. He always tries his best to get Archie and Reggie&#x27;s minds off girls and Jughead to stop being lazy and make an effort, but rarely succeeds for long. He often gets undesired advice from Mr.Weatherbee on how to turn his losing teams around. At one point, he gets so frustrated that he resigns to allow Weatherbee to coach the basketball team his way. Weatherbee&#x27;s overly conservative offense resulted in the Bulldogs losing every game, setting a record for fewest points scored and the fans demanding Kleats&#x27; rehiring. Sometimes he worries that he has grown too old for the job, particularly in contrast to his friend and fellow gym teacher, the trim Coach Clayton. In one story, it is revealed that he has arthritis in his hand. He thought that it would mean the end of his career as an athletic coach, but Archie helped him realize that his ability to teach is what really counts.
*Coach Harry (originally Floyd) Clayton: Chuck&#x27;s dad, a physical education teacher who is portrayed as warm and open to his students when they have problems. He is the basketball and wrestling coach and the only major faculty member who is known to be married. Coach Clayton is a physical education teacher at Riverdale High School who believes in practicing and experimenting with various methods for teaching students. He is also very open and warm, which has led many in the student body to seek out his advice as well as tell him about their problems. Unlike his fellow phys-ed teacher Coach Kleats, he is in excellent physical condition—although both men are very good athletes. He coaches the school&#x27;s basketball and wrestling teams. In the late-1990s, he began to work beyond physical education, and also taught a history class. Coach Clayton&#x27;s first name is either Floyd or Harry, as he has been called Floyd many times by faculty in regular digest stories. The name was created in his early appearances, and used for some time afterwards. However, in some later comics, such as the &quot;Faculty Funnies&quot; miniseries where Mr. Weatherbee, Mr.Flutesnoot, Miss Grundy and Coach Clayton were secretly superheroes who all possessed superpowers, Clayton was referred to as Harry. In still more recent appearances, such as &quot;Tales from Riverdale&quot; #1, his name is still Harry.
*Miss Bernice Beazley: The somewhat grouchy school cafeteria cook. Other than Jughead and Mr.Weatherbee, people often dislike her cooking, but the students always stand beside her. Close friends with Mr.Svenson, she is sometimes revealed to have a soft caring side underneath her attitude. Having originally been trained as a military mess chef, she is also the only faculty member in the entire school who is not afraid to speak her mind or otherwise stand up to Patton Howitzer; when he first appears in the school as a substitute principal for Mr.Weatherbee during his absence due to a football-game-related injury, Miss Beazley temporarily quits in an enraged huff when she finds Mr.Howitzer&#x27;s heavy-handed manner and verbal abuse intolerable.
*Mr.Svenson: The Swedish bus driver and school custodian who is generally good toward the students, who sometimes help him out if he has problems. He often stays at school when it is closed and cleans. Though not the most brilliant person around, he does have practical sense.
*Miss Haggly: Supposedly the eldest teacher in the school, she is overweight with white hair and a shriveled face. Despite her age, she acts surprisingly hip and is rarely troubled by the antics of teenagers. She has been featured less and less in the comics since the 1990s, though is by no means a retired character.
*Patton Howitzer: A crazed, ultra-strict former Drill Sergeant who rules the students with an iron fist. He&#x27;s typically used as a war-obsessed enforcer to Mr.Weatherbee, and is the meanest of all the teachers.
*Miss Phlips: Mr.Weatherbee&#x27;s secretary, a fairly attractive woman compared to other female faculty members. She has not been around as long as many other well-known faculty members. She is portrayed as a young, attractive woman, unlike aging faculty members like Miss Grundy, Miss Beazley, Miss Haggly and other faculty members who have looked old since the early years of Archie Comics. Notably, her name is spelled &quot;Phlips&quot; with one &quot;i&quot;, instead of her having the common last name &quot;Philips&quot;. Calm, efficient and reliable, she often acts as a liaison for the students and holds together what little order is possible at the school.
*Superintendent Herkimer Hassle: The superintendent of the local school district and Mr.Weatherbee&#x27;s superior. Mr.Weatherbee frequently worries when Superintendent Hassle visits the school, though Hassle is often more impressed with the students&#x27; actions than with Weatherbee&#x27;s. In some older stories, he was called Superintendent Smith.

====Minor characters====
*Mr.Jenkins: An old man with a white beard who was the original school counselor at Riverdale High. He got replaced by Mr.Grimley because Mr.Jenkins ended up suffering from a nervous breakdown. Mr.Jenkins is currently in the hospital and seems to be responding well to treatment.
*Mr.Grimley: Mr.Jenkins&#x27;s replacement. He often suffered severe ulcers after hearing the Riverdale students&#x27; outlandish career plans. He did not stay at Riverdale very long, for obvious reasons. At some point, he apparently switched to teaching Driver&#x27;s Education, hoping it would be less stressful, but found it caused him the same problems.
*Ms.Burble: The most recent counselor at Riverdale High. Like her predecessors, this African-American woman is bothered by the students&#x27; silly career ideas, but always manages to keep her cool about it, and it never affects her health. Originally called &quot;Miss&quot; Burble, but in &quot;Tales of Riverdale&quot; #1, she was called &quot;Mrs.&quot;Burble, implying that she has since married.
*Mr.Malcolm Meeks: A timid substitute teacher in the 1980s. He eventually revealed that his timorous nature was the result of his frustration at having been unable to save a comrade when he served in the Vietnam War. Finally Meeks found peace with himself when he saved the victims of a helicopter crash, and took a full-time teaching job at the nearby Tri-City College Preparatory High School. He was just minutes away from the local airport where he would spend his after school hours investigating the wonders of flight. Someday, he mused, he would fly with the local Blue Eagles Team and touch the sky and go beyond the limits of the clouds. Like many characters, he disappeared from view. It is revealed in a later comic that he has moved to Central High to teach.
*Mr.Elmer Fluteweed or Mr.Philo Fluteweed: The original music teacher and band instructor. He seems to have been an early version of Mr.Flutesnoot and as such has not appeared in many this ambiguity makes giving a definitive first appearance impossible. He has mainly appeared in the &quot;Little Archie&quot; universe.
*Miss Crouton: The school&#x27;s Home Economics teacher, primarily seen in the early 1990s, and on and off in later years (including Betty and Veronica Spectacular # 71 and the cover of Archie # 565).
*Mr.Kroskut (sometimes referred to as &quot;Mr.Wood&quot;); A surly, sarcastic shop teacher with a perpetual scowl on his chiseled face. He has not been seen since the 1980s.
*Mr.Adams: A Humanities teacher who first appeared in &quot;Archie &amp; Friends&quot; #117. He is an internationalist, and believes travel abroad is educational. In his first year at Riverdale High, he was able to organize a five-city European &amp; African trip for Riverdale students (including Archie and the gang). Mr.Adams is African-American.
*Patti Pacer and Greta Grappler: Riverdale High&#x27;s female coaches who specifically teach the girls&#x27; teams. Pacer, appearing in 1988, was the faculty sponsor for the cheerleading squad. She was noted for pushing the team and holding grueling practices, which led to success. Coach Kleats found her implausibly young to teach and was initially reluctant to accept her. Later stories featured Grappler, a tough, aggressive coach with a bulky, muscular build, contrasting the physically attractive Patti Pacer.
*Mr.Stanger: The new principal of Riverdale High following Mr.Weatherbee&#x27;s forced early retirement. He is hired due to the school board deciding to update Riverdale High with a more modern curriculum which includes new teaching staff. He first appears in &quot;Jughead&quot; (vol. 3) #1.
*Other, short-lived recurring teachers include Miss Simpkins (Mathematics), Ms.Shapely (substitute teacher, 1970s-1980s), Ms.Samantha Lovett (Drama teacher, 1987), Mr.Money (Art, 1980s), Ms.Kandinsky (Art, early 1990s), Mr.Flores (Computer Science, early 1990s), and Mr.Jordan (shop class).

===Auxiliary members of Archie&#x27;s gang===
*Adam Chisholm: A young guy who moved to Riverdale in &quot;Betty&quot; #87. He is lanky, with brown hair, a thin face, and a medium-built frame. He is slightly taller than Archie or Reggie. He enjoys playing sports such as surfing and football. As soon as he arrived, he became one of Betty&#x27;s dating partners. He is Archie&#x27;s main rival for Betty&#x27;s affections. After he was introduced, he was deeply in love with Betty. She started falling for him, which gave her a dilemma: should she stay with Archie who frequently neglected her, or leave him for Adam? Readers were asked what she should do. This was followed up in &quot;Betty&quot; #99 and #100, where Betty appeared to be leaving Archie for good, but the two-part story ended with Betty doing what readers voted for: date both. She continues to do so to this day. Like the Blossom twins, Adam has proven a successful addition to the infamous love triangle (though, with Reggie, Adam and the Blossom twins involved, it is not really a triangle anymore). Archie thinks very poorly of him, but he&#x27;s only prejudiced against Adam because he doesn’t want him to steal Betty from him. One of the few times when Archie gives Betty his undivided attention is when there&#x27;s a chance of Adam getting a date with her. Adam shows little interest in any other girl. In &quot;Jughead &amp; Friends&quot; #1, his date for a dance was Ginger Lopez, but that was mainly because Betty was already going to the dance with Archie.
*Fangs Fogarty: A fat, snaggle-toothed bully who tormented Archie, Jughead and Reggie in their younger years, principally in the pages of &quot;Little Archie,&quot; and who prominently appeared on the cover of its thirtieth issue. Fangs was an unreasonable thug who brutally battered his classmates, either because they looked at his self-appointed girlfriend Penny, they insulted him behind his back, or for no reason at all. He was, however, good friends with Dilton. When, in one story, Archie and Reggie (not yet knowing this) learned that Dilton is a karate expert—surpassed, he says, only by his friend Edward—they persuaded him to confront Fangs, presuming Dilton could beat him up. In preparation for the encounter, Archie and Reggie deliberately provoked Fangs into a fit of rage. However, when Dilton arrived, he cheerfully greeted Fangs as &quot;Edward.&quot; Presumably, Fangs moved away at around the time Moose Mason arrived in Riverdale. Fangs eventually showed up in the mainstream comics in a story titled &quot;Blast from the Past&quot;, first printed in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Double Digest&quot; #117 (August 2000). Now a tall, muscular, handsome young man nicknamed Smiley after getting his orthodontic work, he had returned to Riverdale to apologize to those he had formerly antagonized. In this story, Fangs&#x27; first name is given as Fred instead of Edward.
*Leroy Lodge: Veronica&#x27;s young cousin who is apparently in Elementary School. He is something of a troublemaker and prankster. He has been a minor but consistently recurring character since the 1940s.
*Ginger Lopez: A Latina-American girl who lives in Riverdale with her parents and her younger twin sisters Eliza and Teresa. To keep her from being confused with Maria Rodriguez, she has blonde bangs and a single mole on her cheek. Ginger works as teen editor for &quot;Sparkle Magazine&quot;. She works with many models, and Betty and Veronica often help her create new fashion lines. &quot;Sparkle&quot; is located in New York City and Ginger spends half of her time there and the other half in Riverdale. She has no permanent boyfriend, and frequently dates outside of her ethnicity, unlike Maria and Nancy. Her introduction, starting with her first appearance in &quot;Betty and Veronica Spectacular&quot; #50, was a bit different from other characters. In the early 2000s, she was originally intended to replace Cheryl Blossom, whom the creators of Archie Comics thought was not popular enough to keep in the comics. In some story reprints, Cheryl&#x27;s hair was re-colored and the text was changed to have her be replaced by Ginger in the story. Many fans were not happy with this, so Cheryl was brought back once again, and Ginger was given stories of her own as a separate character. Initially, Ginger had Cheryl&#x27;s personality, and so appeared to be a rival of Veronica. But with Cheryl&#x27;s return, there was no need for this, so Ginger&#x27;s mean streak was dropped and she became a much nicer character.
*Jinx Malloy: A gloomy, scrawny fellow who causes horrible calamity wherever he goes, and thus has earned the scorn of Riverdale&#x27;s citizens, who often take great lengths to avoid him. Archie and his friends are often victims of the misfortune he spreads. Stories featuring him tend to be about the characters trying to protect themselves from the bad luck he causes. Sometimes, Archie and the gang use his bad luck to influence their enemies. He usually appears slightly shorter than most of the gang, and has sandy hair and a prominent, angular nose. When he causes trouble, he doesn’t seem to know it&#x27;s happening, so he doesn’t know why people avoid him or call him &quot;Jinx&quot;. This implies that Jinx is not his real first name. Although he appeared at least as early as the 1960s (&quot;Archie&#x27;s Pal Jughead&quot; #135) and has continued to make appearances since, he still only appears occasionally and randomly. This makes him and Cricket O&#x27;Dell the longest-lasting minor adolescent characters in Archie Comics. Briefly, Jinx had a girlfriend known as Lucky Penny because of her constant good luck. She was the only one who could be around him without becoming victim to his bad luck influence because extremely good luck came to her whatever she did. Her good luck did not work on anyone else, so Jinx would cause as much bad luck as ever. However, Penny was not a long-lasting character, and appeared only in a couple of stories.
*Marcy McDermott: Veronica&#x27;s nerdy freshman cousin who first came to visit in &quot;Veronica&quot; #181 and continues to visit her now and then. She is a devoted fan of science fiction who enjoys comic book conventions. Veronica is a bit indifferent towards her lifestyle, but Marcy still hangs around and sometimes works as Veronica&#x27;s assistant whenever needed.
*Cricket O&#x27;Dell: A pert, friendly girl with an amazing talent: she is able to smell money or monetary values. Her nose can also determine whether treasure is genuine or not. Despite this trait, she remains humble, and her friends (most particularly Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge) swear by her ability. Her debut suggests that Mr.Lodge also has this unusual ability, and is quite disappointed in Veronica for her lack of it. In one story she not only could smell money but was in love with it. She would fall in love any boy who had money, and once suspected Archie of being one of them because he dated Veronica Lodge. Nowadays she is not portrayed as loving money but simply as possessing the ability to smell it. First introduced in the &quot;Archie&quot; #133 (1962), Cricket appeared in the mainstream stories as well as the pre-Pussycats &quot;Josie&quot; series. In one story, Alexandra Cabot used Cricket&#x27;s ability to her advantage. Cricket soon disappeared from the comics, but was later brought back into view. Like a number of other characters, her appearances proved to have extremely limited use. She has appeared sporadically since then, as she often moves in and out of the cast, but she has yet to be officially retired. Cricket shares some physical resemblance with Archienamely red hair and frecklesdespite being unrelated. Jason Blossom once thought of her as a novelty and brought her to meet his frat brothers. His plan to impress them backfired, as the overwhelming aroma of money knocked her out cold and even burned her nostrils.
*Ambrose Pipps: A small, shy boy with a large nose and an outsized baseball cap pulled over his face. Like Fangs Fogarty, most of his appearances have been in the &quot;Little Archie&quot; series, although for one issue in 1958 he had his own comic, &quot;Little Ambrose.&quot; Ambrose was the tagalong of Archie&#x27;s gang when they were young. Although Ambrose&#x27;s loyalty was unflagging, Little Archie took pride in bullying and exploiting him, without ever letting him join the &quot;good ol&#x27; gang.&quot; Although a teenage Archie was apprehensive when Ambrose returned to Riverdale after several years&#x27; absence, Ambrose held no grudges, and the two became good friends. In the story &quot;The Great Quiz Whiz Contest&quot; reprinted in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Pals &#x27;n&#x27; Gals&quot; #108, Archie pulls out his lucky double sided penny from his pocket that his pal Ambrose gave him. Both Ambrose and Fangs have very brief cameos in &quot;Tales From Riverdale Digest&quot; #24.
*Raj Patel: Yet another new student at Riverdale High. Raj is of Indian descent and lives with his father Ravi, his mother Mona and his sister Tina. He befriended Archie after moving to town and first arrived in &quot;Tales From Riverdale Digest&quot; #21. Raj&#x27;s favorite hobby is filmmaking. He is an expert on no budget special effects, and builds his own models for science fiction movies. He is well liked at school, but sometimes his filmmaking gets on people&#x27;s nerves. Ravi Patel is a doctor who wishes his son would take up more serious issues, while Mona is more supportive. Tina is a year younger than Raj, but she is such a good student that she was moved up a grade so that both she and Raj are in the same year as Archie and the gang. After Raj&#x27;s introduction, he often appeared in daily newspaper strips as well.
*Brigitte Reilly: A brown haired, amply contoured girl who was introduced in the late-1990s and who is close to Betty and Veronica. She is an exchange student from Waynesboro High, Centerville. Betty was the first one to meet her and introduced to Veronica and others. Brigitte is one of the few female teenagers in the Archie Comics universe without an hourglass figure. Although she lacks the sexy appearance of most of Riverdale&#x27;s girls, she is not portrayed in a comical or unflattering way (as she might have in the early years of &quot;Archie&quot;), but has been made as attractive as possible. Briefly, Maria was actually jealous of Brigitte&#x27;s friendship with Frankie. When she was introduced in &quot;Betty and Veronica Spectacular&quot; #27, she joined the school show, and turned out to be good at singing. She&#x27;s also a guitarist, and has a record deal in Central City. In a few stories, she is in a musical duet consisting of herself and Frankie Valdez—she sings and Frankie plays the guitar—but in other stories, she is often a solo artist. When the Spice Girls were popular, she, Betty and Veronica formed a group called the Sassy Girls. However, Brigitte outshone the others, so Betty and Veronica returned to the Archies and let Brigitte go solo. Brigitte is known to date Dilton Doiley. Generally peaceful and friendly, Brigitte is on good terms with everyone in Riverdale. For a minor character, she has been featured prominently on the Archie Comics website.
*Maria Rodriguez: Frankie Valdez&#x27; girlfriend, a Hispanic girl who started out as shy but friendly, and a bit of a “plain Jane,” as in her first appearance in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Girls Betty and Veronica&quot; #257. Despite this, she eventually evolved into a more forceful and fiery character. In the past, she was seldom seen except in conjunction with Frankie. She was introduced as the daughter of the new vice-principal Mr.Rodriguez. While Maria continued to appear, her father did not. Frankie and Maria were added for ethnic diversity, following the success of Chuck and Nancy. The four of them became good friends. For a time, she had black hair and usually wore it in a bun. This was quickly changed to brown flowing hair. Maria is well liked among Archie&#x27;s gang. Initially, when Frankie and Brigitte became a musical duet, Maria got jealous. She was worried that he was going to leave her for Brigitte, and came to realize that the two are just friends. Along with Chuck and Nancy, and Moose and Midge, Frankie and Maria are one of the few definite couples in Archie Comics. She is also a friend of Betty and Veronica.
*Trula Twyst: A femme fatale introduced in a three-part miniseries in &quot;Jughead&quot; #89-91. She formed an organization of girls called J.U.S.T. (Jughead Under Surveillance Team) to help make Jughead forget about food, television, and oversleeping in favour of girls. The resulting battle of the sexes was ultimately a draw and Jughead retained his old ways. She still occasionally appears and causes trouble for him. A student of psychology, she studies the behaviour of her peers, especially Jughead&#x27;s, and is able to predict his every move. While Reggie&#x27;s schemes against Jughead tend to backfire, Jughead can’t escape Trula. Her mother is Krista Twyst, a well-known writer.
*Frankie Valdez: A student of Puerto Rican ancestry, Frankie is flamboyant, romantic, quick-witted, and a bit of a show-off, which has earned him the rivalry of Reggie Mantle. After his first appearance in &quot;Archie Comics&quot; #265, many considered him to be simply another Reggie, although he is nowhere near the exaggerated narcissist/ladies man that Reggie is. However, this comparison didn&#x27;t prevent him from joining the cast permanently. He is good friends with Archie Andrews and Chuck Clayton. Maria is his long-suffering girlfriend, although their relationship has gone through many ups and downs through the years. The two had small roles in the first issue each of &quot;Tales From Riverdale Digest&quot; and &quot;Jughead and Friends Digest&quot;. Frankie sings and plays the guitar. He once won an &quot;American Idol&quot;-style competition, singing an original song he co-wrote with Maria. The Archies and Brigitte Reilly (Riverdale&#x27;s token &quot;chubby&quot; girl) were among his competition. Frankie also is in a singing duet group with Brigitte. They are very popular in the Riverdale scene. Their partnership opened up the possibility of a new love triangle between Brigitte, Frankie and Maria, but it did not last. Frankie is also a great ballroom dancer.
*Wendy Weatherbee: The artistic, quirky and individualist niece of Riverdale High&#x27;s principal Waldo Weatherbee. When she first arrived in &quot;Tales From Riverdale Digest&quot; #10, once the boys found out that she was Mr.Weatherbee&#x27;s niece, they avoided her, afraid of upsetting the principal if they dated his niece. This makes it difficult for her to find a date.
*Tomoko Yoshida: A new Japanese exchange student who hangs around with Betty, starting after she is first seen in &quot;Betty&quot; #150. She was added in the early 2000s. She is an excellent writer and works on the school paper. Like Betty, her dream is to be a professional writer. Before her introduction, Asian people had been seen in the comics, but never as recurring characters. Other Asian teenagers may still appear, but Tomoko is the most frequently seen. She has a brother named Akira. Her relatives include the Morizawas: her Aunt Grace, Uncle Roy and their two young sons Shigeki (preteen) and Royce (toddler). To date, Tomoko has no steady boyfriend, although she occasionally attracts the attention of boys. She has been billed as the star of some stories, such as one where she based her fictional characters on Archie and the gang. Tomoko and her relatives particularly enjoy Japanese manga.

===Other teenagers===

====1940s-early 1960s====
*Cora: A brown-haired girl who appeared only in single-page comic strips in the 1960s. She had Josie&#x27;s classic hairdo (complete with a tiny bow), and was a girlfriend of Reggie.
*Debbie and Dilly Dalton: In the early years, identical blonde twins Debbie and Dilly Dalton appeared. Both pursued Jughead, but enjoyed sharing him.
*Eye-da: A student with one enormous eye where a head should be. She appeared at least twice in the late 1950s, usually as only an unexpected visual punchline at the end of a typical story featuring Betty and Veronica. However, she became a significant character many years later in one incarnation of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. When Sabrina and her aunts moved to Gravestone Heights, a city inhabited by witches, ghosts and monsters, Eye-da (who seemed less out of place there) and an invisible girl named Cleara Glass became Sabrina&#x27;s best friends.
*Ophelia Gluetenschnable: This tall stringy girl evolved into Ethel Muggs, but was even less attractive than Ethel. Her boy-chasing tendencies, particularly toward Jughead, made her seem a bit crazy. In one story, she had unattractive friends Minnie Muenster and Sophie Schlitz who were interested in Archie and Reggie.
*: This petite blonde girl was actually an early concept of Midge because she dated Moose, and he beat up anyone who talked to her. She showed some romantic interest in Jughead.
*Streaky Shore: In the 1940s, he was a jock at Riverdale High. His nickname came from his ability to run fast. He was apparently conceived as a friend of Reggie, but didn’t last beyond the first few years.
*Theodosius Tadpole: Theodosius (Theo for short) was an early concept of Dilton Doiley in the 1940s. After a few appearances, he was later renamed Dilbert, and finally Dilton. As Theodosius, he had a sister named May (a shy, bespectacled brunette, also a Riverdale High student), but Dilton appears to be an only child.
*U.G.A.J.: United Girls Against Jughead. This group of girls is a union dedicated to making Jughead start liking girls, lest other boys follow his lead. While Archie Comics had abandoned this organization (first formed in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Pal Jughead&quot; #79 in the 1960s), Trula Twyst&#x27;s introduction brought J.U.S.T. (Jughead Under Surveillance Team), a similar group that also targets Jughead&#x27;s eating and sleeping habits as well as his dislike of girls. J.U.S.T. disappeared after Trula Twyst became a permanent character, but the saga&#x27;s popularity spawned a reintroduction of U.G.A.J. (though, unlike J.U.S.T., they still only target Jughead&#x27;s dislike of girls).

====Late 1960s-1970s====
*Angel Angelino: Even stronger than Moose and a bigger ladies man than Reggie, this character first appeared in the more serious &quot;adventure&quot; stories in &quot;Life With Archie&quot;, beginning with issue #80. While stories about him made him seem virtually infallible when compared to other boys at first, in the end it is revealed that he is not, indeed, perfect. As Reggie and Moose would have worked as well in his role, a more permanent stay for this character could not reasonably be justified.
*Aquarius: A hippie student with a laid-back outlook on life. A strict vegetarian (&quot;I don&#x27;t dig zappin&#x27; animals for food and rags, man&quot;), he polarized the Archie gang with his views (so far as was allowed within Archie Comics, of course), but hasn&#x27;t been seen since the 1970s.
*Berdie: A student from England, Berdie was a carefree character whose main humorous function was misunderstandings arising from his thick Cockney accent (for example, Miss Grundy once thought that Berdie was transferring to a private high school, when in reality he was going to a private eye school). Presumably Berdie eventually did change schools, as he hasn&#x27;t been seen since the 1970s.
*Central High Students: Riverdale&#x27;s biggest scholastic and athletic rival, Central High seems to consist of nothing but villainous types. The males are generally thuggish, conniving brutes, and the females are usually lecherous, scheming vamps. In most of their encounters, Central students seldom compete without using unsportsmanlike conduct, if not out-and-out cheating. Central&#x27;s coaches and teachers are oftentimes not only aware of this skullduggery but actively encourage it. In most cases, Central&#x27;s team color is bright red, contrasting with Riverdale&#x27;s blue.
*Cheryl and Lori: Two girls who were apparently the forerunners of Debbie and Joani. After Jughead got a strange new hatpin, he began dating girls. Supposedly, the hatpin was like a love magnet: It made girls, particularly Cheryl and Lori, find him attractive. However, fans preferred the old Jughead, so his ladies-man tendencies disappeared quickly. Any later attempts to give Jughead girlfriends did not last long either. Cheryl, who was blonde, is not the same character as red-haired Cheryl Blossom, who first appeared years later.
*Geri: A girl who appeared a few times in single-page gags in the 1960s. She can be recognized by her long golden hair worn in a flip.

====1980s-early 1990s====
*Adam the Alien: Adam debuted in &quot;Archie&quot; #280. While he appeared to be a white-haired human teenager with angular eyes, Adam is in reality an extraterrestrial being. Raised from infancy on a prison-like orphanage asteroid, Adam escaped and now makes his way through the universe trying to discover his home planet. Among Adam&#x27;s talents are shapeshifting, teleportation and levitation. Adam spent some time at Riverdale looking for clues about his past, but ultimately moved on to other planets. Not to be confused with Adam Chisholm.
*Aerobic Liz: Liz is the local Riverdale aerobics instructor who appeared in a few stories in the early 1990s. She appears occasionally in &quot;Jughead&quot; and is fascinated by Jughead&#x27;s metabolism but encourages him to be healthy. She has also taught Veronica an aerobics class when Veronica panicked over gaining some weight. She threw Veronica out of her place, but later Veronica said she admired Liz for standing up to her. She had red hair and freckles, but there was nothing to suggest a connection between her and Archie.
*: Two students at Pembrooke Academy and sometime friends and co-conspirators of Cheryl and Jason Blossom. Cedric, who sports blonde curly hair, is Jason&#x27;s best friend and occasionally accompanies him in his schemes as his sidekick, while black-haired Bunny is closer to Cheryl. As members of the Snob Hill Society, Bunny and Cedric disdain Cheryl and Jason&#x27;s pursuit of Archie, Betty and Veronica (the &quot;townies&quot;) and take steps towards sabotaging the relationships. Both Bunny and Cedric are perpetually suave and emotionally distant, and speak in very clipped and haughty tones. Bunny was renamed Priscilla in some later stories.
*: A character that briefly appeared in the 1990s, who was both African-American and paraplegic. Rather than handling her disabilities naturally, Anita kept bringing them to the surface with comments like &quot;my legs may not work, but at least my brain does&quot;. Ultimately she was jettisoned due to lack of reader interest. However, she is worthy of note because she was a love interest for both Jughead Jones and Dilton Doiley, making her the first instance, in an Archie comic, of interracial romance.
*Crystal the New Age Girl: A character briefly brought in to capitalize on the New Age movement, who endorsed transcendental meditation and the like. She ran a store of New Age products in the mall in the early 1990s. During this time, she made friends with Aerobic Liz, who ran the fitness centre next door. In her first appearance, she, Liz, and Veronica did a lively rap-style dance in her shop. Although she appears to be a hippie, she is not from the hippie era; mainstream popularity of the New Age came in the 1980s and 1990s. As the fad died out, Crystal made a quiet exit.
*: The two characters were introduced when the writers experimented with giving Jughead not one, but two romantic interests. This gave Jughead his own Betty-Archie-Veronica-style love triangle. Debbie was a new girl at Riverdale High whom Jughead developed a crush on, and Joani Jumpp was an old flame from Jughead&#x27;s past who had moved to Riverdale and hoped to resume their relationship. While both Debbie and Joani dated Jughead for a time, and even became friends (Joani even got on at least one Digest cover), neither of them proved to be very long-lasting characters. After Jughead ceased dating the both of them (Debbie broke up with him, and Joani had to move away), both girls faded from view. They made a cameo appearance in &quot;Tales from Riverdale&quot; # 24 in the story Civil Chores Part 3.
*Claude and Raoul Hopper: Two acquaintances of Archie and the gang who were skilled in breakdancing. They had a rather bizarre role, often showing up out of the blue to provide sage advice to Archie, based on their inner-city background. Despite their mutual last name, Claude is tall and black and Raoul (sometimes spelled Raul) is short and white. As a dancing duo, they dubbed themselves the Hip Hoppers, and have been known to work with the Archies. The Hoppers have not been seen since the 1990s, though they have made some appearances in recent comics to help Archie and his friends whenever there was a problem.
*Dexter Howard: A college-age freshman that was introduced as a potential love interest for Betty, that would be introduced in order to create a love triangle between Betty, Archie, and Dexter. The character was originally conceived and drawn as African-American; however, the editor of &quot;Betty and Me&quot; objected to an interracial romance between Betty and an African-American male and had Dexter re-colored as a Caucasian male before the character&#x27;s debut issue was printed. After a few appearances, Dexter was written out of Betty and Me and never reappeared in an Archie comic. 
*: This blind boy, constantly seen with his guide dog Spike, was a love interest for Ethel Muggs. The idea for his character was based on the fact that the blind cannot judge people by appearance, so Jeff would find Ethel attractive in ways that most boys fail to notice. He was around at the same time as Anita (see above), and was dropped for the same reason.
*Lucky Penny: Penny was Jinx Malloy&#x27;s short-lived girlfriend. Nicknamed &quot;Lucky Penny&quot;, she had the ability to ward off Jinx&#x27;s bad luck with her good luck. In her first appearance, everyone warned her about Jinx, but she still managed to find gold coins hidden under a tree and then got a job as a model for an advertising company, proving her immunity to Jinx&#x27;s bad luck. She appeared at least twice.
*Pencil Neck G.: A geeky boy at Archie&#x27;s school, he has long messy hair and a floppy wool hat that covers his eyes. He also appeared in the &quot;Freshman Years&quot; miniseries.
*: A heavy metal band and friends of Jughead when he was infatuated with the skateboarding culture. While the four band membersScud, Scum, Slime, and Slugdiffered visually, they had no real personalities to speak of. Ultimately, Jughead quit hanging out with them, and they vanished.
*Glenn Scarpelli: It is rare for Archie Comics to feature actual celebrities in their comics rather than parodies of celebrities. However, in the 1980s, actor-singer Glenn Scarpelli, the son of Archie Comics artist Henry Scarpelli, made a few appearances, when his career was at its height.
*Sundance: A transfer student from California, Sundance is similar to Aquarius in that he is a &quot;hippie&quot; as well as a vegetarian. His Californian way of speaking (using terms like &quot;bummed out&quot;) captured Betty and Veronica, but they began racing back when Sundance introduced his sister Moondance, who Archie and Reggie found extremely attractive.
*Sassy Thrasher: During the late-1980s and early 1990s, Jughead got a &quot;skater punk&quot; makeover. At this time, Sassy, like Anita, Jeff, and the Potholes, was added as a member of the &quot;Jughead&quot; cast. She was very rebellious and fond of skateboarding, but like the other characters in the makeover, didn’t last very long, nor did the makeover itself.

====Late 1990s====
*Googie Gilmore: In the late 1990s, Jughead and his family moved to a different house in Riverdale. The next-door neighbours were the Gilmores. Their daughter Googie was obsessed with health food, and always tried to get Jughead to change his eating habits and give up junk food. However, before she stopped appearing, she and Jughead ended with a truce and a compromise.

====Early 2000s====
*Alison Adams: A spectacled brown-haired girl who appeared a few times in the 2000s. She belonged to the same science club as Dilton. The two were very friendly, but did not seem to become more than &quot;just friends&quot;.
*Alistair Andrews: Archie&#x27;s rich cousin who appeared in a couple of multipart stories. He looks exactly like Archie.
* Fletcher Foley: A member of the science club along with Dilton (his rival) and Alison. Has a crush on Alison, but she doesn&#x27;t reciprocate. Always out to come out on top of Dilton, but more often as not, fails.
*Randy (Randolph): This cosmopolitan character moved to Riverdale for a while. He is built almost like Adam Chisholm, with a shoulder-length ponytail of brown hair, glasses, a black top hat with a red band, and sometimes a black cape with red lining. Randy enjoys the Japanese anime &quot;Captain Tuxedo&quot;, and wants to emulate this superhero. Randy has been known to date Veronica.
*Kim Wong: A Chinese teenager who moved to Riverdale after her father opened a branch of Wong Enterprises in Riverdale. She is good at martial arts, and is a friend of Betty and Veronica. Though she does not appear as often as Tomoko Yoshida, both are recurring characters. In this way, there are different characters to represent different regions of East Asia, rather than a single token character.

====Late 2000s====
*Austin, Brandon and George: Three boys matched with Cheryl Blossom when she went on the television show &quot;Lonely Hearts Club,&quot; following a break-up with Reggie. The five-part story entitled &quot;And the Winner is...&quot; was featured in &quot;Betty and Veronica Double Digest&quot; #161-165 in 2008. She would date three boys and the show&#x27;s audience (represented by the readers) would vote for which one she ended up with. All three dates left something to be desired. Austin, a rugged outdoorsman, took the fun out of the date for Cheryl with his health obsession. Brandon, a rich computer expert, was a much bigger klutz than Archie and was originally depicted as African-American in the solicitation for the comic but had a much lighter skin tone in the actual comic. George, an aspiring master chef, attracted too many of his bothersome fans, including Jughead. In the end, according to the readers’ votes, Cheryl was matched with George, which pleased her. At some point after this, Austin and Brandon dated Betty and Veronica.
*Toño Díaz: Toño was born in Mexico, and assists his parents, Adrián and Rosa in their party planning business. Rosa handles Public Relations and the administrative part of the business, while Adrián is responsible for the creative and labor portions of the family business. They arrived in Riverdale in &quot;Pal&#x27;s &#x27;n&#x27; Gals Double Digest&quot; #123. Toño enjoys helping them with gardening and decoration, but the part he likes the most is cooking. He wants to become a great chef when he grows up.
*Kumi Tanura: A Japanese girl who moved to Riverdale in &quot;Betty and Veronica Digest&quot; #190 with her parents and her younger sister Ami. Kumi finds the English language somewhat difficult. Two issues after her introduction, it was revealed that at home, her mother keeps up Japanese traditions and etiquette. Notably, Kumi stories are written by Misako Rocks!, a Japanese artist and writer who moved to NYC in 2001. Ami is only thirteen years old, but appears to have a crush on Archie.
*The Veronicas: When Australian twins Jess and Lisa Origliasso became a pop duo called The Veronicas (after a line from the movie &quot;Heathers&quot;) in real life, a lawsuit from Archie Comics followed. It was soon settled, and, as a promotion for both parties, Jess and Lisa appeared in some stories in the 2000s, often alongside either Veronica or The Archies band.

====Early 2010s====
*Antoinette &quot;Toni&quot; Topaz: A girl appearing in the Jughead stories. Toni has pink hair and wears hoop earrings. Nicknamed &quot;Two-Fisted Toni&quot;, she debuted in &quot;Jughead Double Digest&quot; #176 as one of Jughead&#x27;s opponents in a cupcake eating contest.
** Vanessa Morgan portrays Antoinette &quot;Toni&quot; Topaz in &quot;Riverdale&quot;. In this version, Toni is initially introduced as a love interest for her fellow Southside Serpent, Jughead Jones, but enters into a relationship with Cheryl Blossom instead.
*Trevor &quot;Trev&quot; Brown: First appeared in &quot;Archie&quot; #631 (May 2012), is the African-American younger brother of Valerie Brown, who is a member of the Pussycats. He serves as a romantic love interest for Betty Cooper. 
** Adain Bradley portrays Trev Brown in &quot;Riverdale&quot;.
*The Riverdale Gang: A group of friendly vampires who appear in &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot; #261-262.

===Other characters===

====Riverdale townspeople====
*Dr. Sara Bellum: Sara is an attractive young psychiatrist who counseled Jughead and eventually wrote a self-help book that was based on her sessions with him. She appeared during Jughead&#x27;s &quot;new look&quot; period in the early 1990s when he was a skateboarder.
*Mayor Glibb: The mayor of Riverdale for a time. Apparently from Texas, Glibb always spoke grandiosely and wore a ten-gallon hat. He seemed to be more interested in publicity and fame than governing Riverdale properly.
*Mr.Pansky: Mr.Pansky owns a costume shop in Riverdale. Most of the gang goes to his store whenever they need an outfit for a themed party. In some stories, Mr.Pansky has hired Archie, Jughead, or Reggie.
*Samm: A thin, bespectacled man who often appeared in crowd scenes, or on posters (most of which read &quot;Vote for Samm&quot;). He was a self-portrait of his creator, Samm Schwartz. He was also a good friend of Jughead Jones.
*Segarini: A pizza parlor owner and Pop Tate&#x27;s biggest rival. However, while Jughead enjoys the food of both, he and the gang stay loyal to Pop, and the Chocklit Shoppe remains their hangout.
*Lydia Wyndham: Betty&#x27;s elderly neighbor. They first met when Betty discovered a love letter between her and the man she loved, and tracked her down. Betty also found out that Lydia&#x27;s lover, a World War I soldier, died in battle. Betty often asked her for advice and did favors for her. Lydia is passionate about her writing, which is one reason Betty looked up to her. Unfortunately, Lydia died (something rare for an Archie character). Betty inherited Lydia&#x27;s diaries and everything else she had written.

====Other adults====
*Betty&#x27;s Auto Racing Rivals: In 2006, Betty began racing cars for Mr.Lodge. Mr.Lodge had been the sponsor to driver Dale Jonas, but Dale had been bribed to join Mr.Lodge&#x27;s rival outfit. Betty became the new Lodge auto racer. A frequent theme mentioned is the sexism in auto racing. This was why Betty took a co-ed pit crew (Archie, Veronica, Jughead, Reggie, Chuck and Nancy). Besides the arrogant Dale Jonas, Betty had a friendly rival named Marty &quot;Speedy&quot; Spencer. later replaced Dale with a female driver Bonita) Quick.
*General Pickens: An army general from the American Civil War who served on a battlefield, part of which is now Riverdale. He only appears in references to the local history. The park in Riverdale is named Pickens Park in his honor. In one &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Time Police&quot; story, it is revealed that in the future, Jughead will clone himself, and the clone (who is an old man by the time we meet him) only comes out of hibernation when needed. He went with Jughead and January McAndrews to the Civil War and became a hero under the alias Pickens. The army assumed Pickens dead, but he simply returned to his own time and went back in hibernation. Oddly, in this story, he is a colonel. However, he was promised a promotion if he succeeded, and may have received a posthumous promotion.
*Dr. Soonpoon: Dr. Soonpoon is an importer/exporter who possesses mystical powers like time travel, and has appeared in at least two issues. He is shown wearing a turban.
*Ms.Stonewall: The head counselor at a girl&#x27;s summer camp where Betty and Veronica occasionally worked in the 1980s. In her job, Ms.Stonewall dressed in Native American attire, and may have been the first recurring Native American in Archie Comics. One of her campers was a girl named Tessie.
*O. O. Wellenmellen and Bruce Baby: A rotund, pompous movie director, Wellenmellen is known for filming spectacular, if patently ridiculous, art films. His catchphrase is &quot;Nobody but nobody says &#x27;no&#x27; to O. O. Wellenmellen!&quot; Bruce Baby is his overeager, effeminate, sandal-clad assistant. They mainly appeared in the early stories.

====Children====
*The Feebly Twins: Identical twin brothers Glenn and Benn Feebly who played the bass fiddle (it took both little guys to do it). They occasionally appeared in the 1980s, but never had any character development, and faded from view.
*Tessie McGuire: A girl with short red hair and glasses who sometimes attended the summer camp where Betty and Veronica worked as counsellors. Originally a troublemaker at camp, she was known as Terrible Tessie, but the girls helped turn her around, and she became a lot nicer. She looked up to Betty and Veronica. Ms.Stonewall was her head counselor.

====Nonhumans====
*Jingles: A magical elf in the employ of Santa Claus, who often shows up in Riverdale during the Christmas season. While Jingles can be a bit clumsy and hot-tempered, he often manages to use his magical powers to create a happy ending. Adults cannot see Jingles, and it is implied that Archie and the gang&#x27;s interactions with Jingles will someday come to an end.
*Sugarplum: A sugarplum fairy who appears at Christmas time to help spread Christmas cheer. She thus has a similar role to Jingles (see above); however, while Jingles is a friend to all of the main teenagers, Sugarplum mainly interacts with Betty and Veronica.

===Spin-offs===

====&quot;Dynamic New Look&quot; series====
*Sandy Sanchez: A straight-A student and star athlete at Riverdale High. She is determined to earn college scholarships, so she chooses not to date while in high school. In Sandy&#x27;s introductory story (&quot;The Matchmakers&quot; in &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Double Digest&quot; #139-142), Betty and Veronica conspired to bring Jughead and Sandy together as a couple. However, the gang was appalled when Jughead and Sandy apparently fall so deeply in love that Jughead gives up food, his crown hat and even the nickname &quot;Jughead&quot;, while Sandy let her grades slip and quit the school team. In the end, it turned out that they had only been pretend to be in love to teach the others a lesson about setting people up. However, at the very end of the story, there is some inconclusive evidence that Sandy and Jughead may be occasionally dating in secret. Sandy later appeared in other &quot;Dynamic New Look&quot; miniseries.
*: A teenaged delinquent introduced for the four-part “Bad Boy Trouble” (&quot;Betty &amp; Veronica Double Digest&quot; #151-154) who moved to town to live with his aunt and uncle. After sneaking into a movie, he and Veronica fell in love. Betty and Midge tried hopelessly to convince her that dating him was a bad idea. Mr.Lodge forbade it, but Veronica secretly disobeyed. Nick also tried to hit on Betty, but she wanted nothing to do with him. He would pick on others, break rules and act tougher than he really was. His catchphrase was &quot;A saint I ain&#x27;t.&quot; Betty decided that the only way to make Veronica see the truth was to go on a date with Nick. This caused Veronica to break off with both of them. The gang confronted Nick together, and the next day, Nick is not seen, as he has been sent to a military school. Veronica learned why Betty went out with Nick, and forgave her immediately. Nick later appeared in &quot;Tales of Riverdale&quot; #24 and &quot;Betty &amp; Veronica&quot; #237.
* Eddie and Freddie Turner: Identical twins who appear as background characters in &quot;Moose and Midge: Breakup Blues&quot;.
* Judy Johnson: A romantic rival for Midge Klump, who appears in &quot;Moose and Midge: Breakup Blues&quot;, when she breaks up with Moose Mason and he starts dating Judy Johnson. She comes off as popular and sociable, mainly with the boys, but Betty and Veronica don&#x27;t seem to take too kindly to her, nor does Midge, since she seems to drive a wedge between them and the boys.
* Rocco: Student from Southside High School, also appearing in &quot;Moose and Midge: Breakup Blues&quot;. Part of the conflict between Moose and Midge stems from Rocco&#x27;s staring at Midge while she and Moose are at Pop Tate&#x27;s. He also goes after Archie for his clumsiness both at Pop Tate&#x27;s and later at the Teen Machine Dance Club. His tough, bullying, nasty side shows at the dance contest when he confronts and throws Reggie in an attempt to get Midge to dance with him, then going after Archie when he confronts him.
* Diss Dress: A rock band appearing at the end of &quot;Moose and Midge: Breakup Blues&quot;. They are the live band playing at the Teen Machine Dance Club.

====&quot;Little Archie&quot;====

*Mad Doctor Doom &amp; Chester: Not to be confused with Marvel Comics&#x27; Doctor Doom, Mad Doctor Doom is a green-skinned mad scientist who has terrorized Archie and the gang since they were children, as they constantly foiled his plans of gaining great wealth and conquering the world. Doom was assisted by Chester, his nitwitted, teenaged slacker of an assistant (occasionally said to be his nephew). Chester looks and acts like a stereotypical 1950s juvenile delinquent. They both made at least one appearance in the mainstream comics.
*Evelyn Evernever: A young girl who was acquainted with Archie and friends when they were young. Evelyn was a shy girl with a bit of an inferiority complex, with tenuous relations to the rest of the gang. Her only real friend was her doll, Minerva. Evelyn Evernever likes to think of herself as a &quot;bou&#x27;tiful&quot; gal. After a long hiatus Evelyn Evernever reappears as a teenage girl who kidnapped Archie in a recent all-out action issue of &quot;Betty &amp; Veronica Spectacular&quot;. It was shown in a recent issue of &quot;Veronica&quot; that Evelyn was Archie&#x27;s first kiss.
*Bubbles McBounce: Bubbles McBounce was an obese girl from &quot;Little Archie&quot;. Being heavier than the other kids, she is known for such moments as the time she saved the day by holding down an air balloon that risked taking Archie and the gang on a magical voyage.
*Penny Peabody: Fangs Fogarty&#x27;s girlfriend. Their relationship is exactly like Moose and Midge&#x27;s: Fangs will hurt any boy who even talks to Penny.
*The Perilous Pike: A pike that lives in Logger&#x27;s Pond, a large pond near Riverdale. No one has ever caught the Perilous Pike, though some people have &quot;almost&quot; caught him. In some stories, attempts to fish for him cause the Pike to attack a member of Archie&#x27;s gang.
*The Southside Serpents: A gang of kids who were the rivals of Little Archie&#x27;s gang and lived in the southern district of Riverdale. They filled the role of Central High Students when a rival group was needed.
*Sue Stringly: Sue was a poor little girl who knew Archie and the gang when they were young. Sue&#x27;s family didn&#x27;t have much money, and they lived in a shack near the railway tracks. Despite this, Sue was an upbeat, cheerful girl who never complained or despaired over her predicament. While most of the school students didn&#x27;t want anything to do with her, eventually Sue became good friends with Little Archie and Veronica. Her father was sometimes said to be working in a pickle plant. Sue also lived next to a coal mine. In one story, she was called a cousin of Veronica Lodge. Although her hair is blonde, she bears a resemblance to Big Ethel. After a long hiatus right after Evelyn Evernever returns, Sue Stringly reappears as a teenage secret agent who rescues Archie and befriends Betty and Veronica (Agent B &amp; Agent V) in a recent issue of &quot;Betty &amp; Veronica Digest&quot;. She also appears as a teenager when she tries to get a date with Reggie. He, thinking of the skinny girl from his childhood, fakes sickness. Archie, the kind teen he is, takes Reggie&#x27;s place with his childhood friend. Little do they know, Sue has grown into an attractive women who they both swoon over.
*Little Ambrose: A shy boy that Little Archie and his gang would tease.

*Babette: The main villain in &quot;Archie’s R/C Racers&quot;. She and her bungling henchmen trailed Archie and the gang on their cross-country race to cause trouble for them. She owned a company that made radio-controlled vehicles. She was apparently a madwoman because her main motive in ruining the race was that the gang chose to endorse another company instead of her own.
*C.R.U.S.H.: A parody of T.H.R.U.S.H., this evil spy organization was the main antagonist in &quot;The Man From R.I.V.E.R.D.A.L.E.&quot;, a series of spy-themed stories appearing in the &quot;Life With Archie&quot; title in the mid- to late 1960s, meant to capitalize on the popularity of spy films and TV series at the time. It was never revealed what C.R.U.S.H. actually stood for. The evil agents from C.R.U.S.H. often had bizarre arsenals and abilities.
*: This character, although African-American, was really a re-imagining of Dilton. He appeared only in &quot;The New Archies&quot; when Archie and the gang were Junior High Students. As he filled the role of both Chuck and Dilton, neither of those characters appeared in the series.
*Danni Malloy: This redhaired teenaged girl appeared only in &quot;Dilton’s Strange Science&quot;. She served as Dilton&#x27;s best friend, love interest, and partner in their science-related adventures. Her shared last name with Jinx Malloy is probably a coincidence.
*: She is the 29th century descendant of Archie, and is one of the characters in the short-lived &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Time Police&quot;. One of the few girls that Jughead truly loves, she is also his superior in the Time Police squad. She also appears in the 2019 reboot of the series.
*&quot;Slimy&quot; Sal Monella: Sal Monella was the villain of the short-lived &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Diner&quot; comic book.

*Lady Smitty: Full name Lady Winchester Huntington-Smythe Jones, but she goes by her nickname Lady Smitty. This rich woman appeared frequently in &quot;Veronica’s Passport&quot;, serving as a foil to Veronica Lodge. Veronica often ran into her on her travels. Lady Smitty had a husband named David and a teenaged son named Jared. She also has a nephew named Archie, which looks different from and not to be confused with the other character of the same first name and also lives in France.

==&quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; series==

*Sabrina Spellman: A friend of Archie and the gang, she is secretly a witch who tries to balance her normal teenaged life with her witch life. She is steady with her boyfriend Harvey who, like everyone else, does not know that she is a witch. There have been several different series and incarnations.
*Hilda Spellman and Zelda Spellman: Sabrina&#x27;s aunts, the sisters of her late father, and her legal guardians. Originally, Hilda was tall and thin with red hair, and Zelda was short and plump with green hair. They were made more attractive in a revival of the comics. Hilda tends to be strict and short-tempered and finds Harvey annoying, but really only wants what is best for Sabrina. Zelda is calm, flexible and easy-going compared to her sister.
*Salem Saberhagen: The Spellmans&#x27; talking cat. He is really a witch that the Witches&#x27; Council turned into a cat as punishment. He has a sarcastic, somewhat self-centered attitude, but he and the Spellmans care for each other greatly.
*Harvey Kinkle: Sabrina&#x27;s boyfriend in all versions of the comics. He first appears in &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Laugh-Out&quot; #1, as does Cousin Ambrose. Hilda has a low opinion of him, although she would never try to break them up. He is fairly naïve and does not know that Sabrina is a witch, despite the fact that strange things seem to happen around her. While this makes their relationship awkward, they remain as close as ever.
*Miss Della the Head Witch: The witch who is the boss, and would drop in occasionally to check up on their evil deeds.
*Cousin Ambrose: Cousin Ambrose is a male witch that always tries to give advice to Sabrina. He also tries to find love, but fails.

==&quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; series==

*Josie McCoy (originally Josie Jones) is the main character of the series and leader and songwriter of the titular music group. She plays guitar and sings in the band. She is a sweet, level headed, red-haired girl and often the stable center in the chaotic antics that her friends get into.
*Melody Valentine, the group&#x27;s drummer, is a stereotypical dumb blonde: naïve, absent-minded, carefree, and often misusing language. She serves as the series&#x27;s comic relief, and her overwhelming sex appeal invariably drives boys crazy.
*Valerie Brown is the African-American bassist of the Pussycats. She is a scientific and mechanical genius and usually presents the solution to a problem. Somewhat of a tomboy, she will readily stand up for what she believes in.
*Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; Cabot III is the rich, snobby, and not very dependable manager for the band. He often comes up with schemes that are supposed to benefit him, but they always seem to fail. He is infatuated with Josie, but never manages to win her over.
*Alexandra Cabot, Alex&#x27;s twin sister, is also the series&#x27;s evillest character and indeed its main villain. She wants to take over the band, but has no talent of her own. She is conniving, hateful, and completely selfish, and wants to steal Alan M. from Josie. She also has a cat named Sebastian with a similar personality.
*Alan M. Mayberry is Josie&#x27;s blond, muscular, good-hearted boyfriend. Originally a folk singer in his own right, he became the Pussycats&#x27;s primary road crew captain after the group formed. Alex constantly makes fun of him, while Alexandra keeps trying to date him. However, he and Josie remain devoted only to each other.
*Pepper Smith was Josie&#x27;s original best friend and the third member of the lead trio. Sarcastic and level-headed, she regularly dated dumb jock Socrates. She was essentially replaced by Valerie with the &quot;Pussycats&quot; revamp.
*Albert was Josie&#x27;s original steady boyfriend and rival of Alexander.

Jason lives with his family in Pembrooke, the &quot;rich&quot; side of Riverdale, and refers to those who live on the other side as &quot;Townies&quot;. He most often appeared during the 1990s, when the &quot;Cheryl Blossom&quot; series was published. During that time, the Blossom twins attended Pembrooke High, a private school for rich students. Despite Jason&#x27;s views, he is mainly attracted to Betty Cooper rather than Veronica Lodge.
*Clifford and Penelope Blossom: Cheryl and Jason&#x27;s parents. The Blossom family is well-off due to the fortune that Clifford made as a software designer. He and Penelope are generally not pleased about their children&#x27;s arrogance and want them to learn a little humility.

==&quot;That Wilkin Boy&quot; series==

More or less content with his lot in life, he prefers not to get involved with his friends&#x27; relationship problems. He has been shown to drum on almost everything in sight, and will lose his mind if he does not.
*Rebel: Bingo&#x27;s dog who is capable of conscious thought. He and Teddy have a mutual hate relationship. Rebel tries to play Cupid between Bingo and Samantha and is often the one who thwarts Teddy&#x27;s schemes.

==&quot;Li&#x27;l Jinx&quot; series==

*Li&#x27;l Jinx Holliday: A mischievous little girl who was born on Halloween. She is playful, imaginative and has many close friends. Her stories are usually more plausible to happen to elementary school age children than those of &quot;Little Archie&quot;.
*Hap and Merry Holliday: Li&#x27;l Jinx&#x27;s parents. Like many parents, her father Hap is constantly bothered by his daughter&#x27;s antics, but this does not change how much he loves her. While he is a major character, Jinx&#x27;s mother Merry almost never appears in the comics.

*&quot;Sis&quot; Keene: Katy&#x27;s redheaded younger sister. Originally an elementary school student, but later portrayed as the same age as Archie and the gang. Her first name, depending on the incarnation, is Melissa, Mackenzie or Sissy, but she is mostly just called Sis.
*Katy&#x27;s friends: Katy&#x27;s close friends include her fellow models Gloria Grandbilt and Lucki Lorelei. The former (called Gloria Gold in later incarnations) is her vain blonde rival for the boys&#x27; affections, while the latter is her redheaded superstitious best friend, with level headed brunette Katy Keene rounding out the group.

Kelly (a boxer), Randy van Ronson (K.O.&#x27;s rich rival), Ramon Ramirez (a Latino airline pilot and talented dancer), Arnold Horsenlegger (an Austrian muscleman/movie star obviously modeled on Arnold Schwarzenegger), and Click Lenz (the girls&#x27; fashion photographer).

==&quot;Archie&#x27;s Mad House&quot;==

*Captain Sprocket: A bungling but victorious superhero who appeared for many issues. For a time, he was the closest thing the series had to a main character; most of the stories featured one-time character.

==&quot;Wilbur&quot; series==

*Wilbur Wilkin: Despite debuting three months before Archie, this self-absorbed blond teenager is typically called an Archie clone. Wilbur has more of a tendency to play dirty to get what he wants than the more well-meaning Archie, and did not share Archie&#x27;s popularity.
*Laurie Lake: Wilbur&#x27;s steady sweet, blonde and beautiful girlfriend. Typically a sensible girl, but can be somewhat ditzy. She is comparable to Betty Cooper, although Wilbur prefers her to her rich arrogant rival, unlike Archie and his girlfriends.
*Linda Moore: A sassy, well-off brunette girl with a bit of a mean streak. She adores Wilbur and constantly schemes to get between him and Laurie. When displeased, she will not hesitate to make this known. Laurie and Linda resemble Betty and Veronica with the roles reversed.
*Red: Wilbur&#x27;s best friend and confidante, with a personality to match Jughead. Marked by his glasses and red hair, he is content to watch the dating scene from the sidelines. Near the end of the series run, he was re-imagined into the shorter, fatter Sheldon.
*Slats: The role of Wilbur&#x27;s rival has varied over the years (Lester, Alec, Bolo), but most of the time, Slats filled the role. Slats is a low-down, devious schemer who is constantly trying to pull pranks on Wilbur or take the girls from him.

==&quot;Suzie&quot; series==
*Suzie: A cheerful, but completely ditzy blonde teenager with clumsiness to match Archie&#x27;s. Unlike Archie, she is fresh out of high school, but due to her ineptness, she cannot keep a job. Boys flock to her beauty, but lose interest when they learn the trouble she unintentionally causes.
*Ferdie: Suzie&#x27;s redheaded, dorky slacker for a boyfriend and closest confidante. When Suzie is at risk to do more harm than good, Ferdie is usually stuck trying to keep things under control. No matter what happens to Suzie, Ferdie is always someone she can count on.

==&quot;Ginger&quot; series==
*: Yet another mischievous, fun-loving teenager who was an attempt to recapture Archie&#x27;s success. Ginger falls for the opposite sex easily, although her tastes are much broader than Archie, and she even tends to fall for her male teachers. Her parents&#x27; names are Fred and Lotta.
*Dottie/Dotty, later Patsy: One of Ginger&#x27;s closest friends. She has dark hair, sometimes wears glasses, sometimes has freckles and sometimes her face is somewhat chubbier than most girls in Archie comics. She fills the role of the more easy-going sidekick to Ginger.
*Iccky (or Ickky): A resourceful nerd, similar to Dilton Doiley, but is more confident in regards to girls. He has a constant crush on Ginger and is pleased that a girl as beautiful as her is willing to date him. Though she often stands him up, he knows there will be other chances.

The character debuted in &quot;Blue Ribbon Comics&quot; #2 (December 1939) in a story written by Harry Shorten and illustrated by Irv Novick before making other appearances in issues of &quot;Top Notch Comics&quot; published from 1940 to 1942. The character was briefly revived in the 1964 comic &quot;Mighty Crusaders&quot;.
*Thunder Bunny (Bobby Caswell): A boy who received the power to turn into an anthropomorphized rabbit with flight and superhuman strength when he touched a box containing the spirit of the last member of an alien race.
*The Hangman (Robert Dickering): The Comet&#x27;s brother who became the Hangman to avenge the Comet after he was killed. He relies on his natural physical and mental abilities.
*The Scarlet Avenger (Jim Kendall): A scientist who began fighting crime after his family died in a plane crash of which he was the only survivor. He uses advanced technology and weaponry.
*The Red Rube (Reuben Reuben): A redheaded runaway from a cruel orphanage turned cub reporter for the &quot;Daily Sun&quot; who drank a magic elixir that allows him access to the abilities of his ancestors whenever he says the phrase, &quot;Hey, Rube!&quot; Transformed into a bare-chested, red cape and trousers-clad adult superhero, he has enhanced physical abilities of strength, speed and invulnerability.
*Fireball (Ted Tyler): A fireman who was attacked by an arsonist then doused in a mix of chemicals, that gave him the power to absorb heat and control flames.

==Other series==
*Cosmo the Merry Martian: The first Martian to visit Earth, sent out to explore the planet. Accompanying him was his smaller, less-learned traveling companion Orbi. Their adventures only lasted six issues, each ending with a cliffhanger.
*Super Duck: A duck who parodies Superman. Joined by his bratty nephew Fauntleroy and temperamental girlfriend Uwanna, Super Duck (nicknamed Supe) typically ended up in hapless situations instead of saving the day.
*Pat Smith: The star of &quot;Pat the Brat&quot; and a sarcastic, mischievous little boy. He was much smarter than other kids his age, but used those smarts to make trouble. He was not above outright taking advantage of people, including his own parents Oswald and Alice.
*Pipsqueak: Another troublemaking child starring in &quot;The Adventures of Pipsqueak&quot;. His parents were often his victims. Unlike most Archie titles, Pipsqueak&#x27;s art style resembles that of a daily newspaper strip, which was the main feature that distinguished it from &quot;Pat the Brat&quot;.
*Seymour: A boy who starred in the one-offs &quot;My Son The Teenager&quot; and &quot;More Seymour&quot;. Like so many other Archie-like characters, Seymour is girl-crazy and causes havoc unintentionally. In this case, the catastrophic results of Seymour&#x27;s clumsiness usually come at the expense of his beleaguered, white-haired father, who is simply referred to as &quot;Poppa&quot;. In the one-off &quot;My Son The Teenager&quot;, the narrative is a poem written by the father entitled &quot;A Father&#x27;s Lament&quot;. The poem itself paints Seymour as a very loving and angelic boy, while the cartoon shows the complete opposite. Seymour is not only clumsy and causes havoc unintentionally, but is also a lazy, girl-crazy, class clown sort of boy. The one-off &quot;More Seymour&quot; is a two-part story. In the first part, Seymour&#x27;s father tries to keep him from spending the day at the beach by giving him a long laundry list of household chores to do before he goes to enjoy the sun. However, after screwing up literally every chore assigned, Seymour&#x27;s father finally relents and begs him to go to the beach. In the second part, Seymour is at the beach with his blonde girlfriend and bubble gum chewing best friend. Seymour&#x27;s time at the beach is short-lived, however, as his clumsiness draws the wrath of literally everyone else that is there. These people end up forming an angry mob who chase him off the beach. This overused formula may have hindered Seymour from appearing in more issues.

<doc id="808864" wikidata="Q834869" url="?curid=808864" title="Bulls, New Zealand">
<text>Bulls () is a town in the Rangitikei District of New Zealand. It is in a fertile farming area at the junction of State Highways 1 and 3, northwest of Palmerston North. According to a Statistics New Zealand estimate, Bulls has a population of inhabitants.

Recent marketing makes puns with the name, for example, &quot;New Zealand gets its milk from Bulls&quot; or the sign for the local police station &quot;Const-a-bull&quot;.

==Etymology==

There are two recorded Māori toponyms for the area – Te Ara Taumaihi and Ō-hine-puhiawe. The origins of Te Ara Taumaihi have yet to be explicitly explored. Ō-hine-puhiawe, a land block where Parewahawaha marae is situated, acts as a synecdoche to refer to the current town area. The modern town name is named after James Bull who owned the first general store there. The town was originally called Bull Town, but this was changed to Clifton and then renamed back to Bulls at the urging of Sir William Fox.

==History and culture==

The eastern end of the State Highway 1 bridge over the Rangitikei River south-east of the town collapsed suddenly in 1973 while being crossed by a bus. No-one was killed and the collapsed part was rebuilt.

The former Lake Alice Psychiatric hospital is 7 km (4 mi) north of Bulls, the hospital closed in 1999. Lake Alice was a large contributor to the Bulls and Marton economy.

Bulls is covered by the Whanganui Chronicle, a daily paper part of the NZ Herald network that serves the Whanganui, Ruapehu and Rangitīkei regions.

Slasher film X was partially filmed in Bulls, namely the interior shots of the farmhouse which were filmed inside the Bulls town hall.

===Marae===

The local Parewahawaha Marae is a traditional meeting ground for the Ngāti Raukawa hapū of Ngāti Parewahawaha. It is on land known as Ōhinepuhiawe.

The marae features the Parewahawaha meeting house, a whare tūpana opened on 15 April 1967 by Maori Queen Te Atairangikaahu. At the time it was opened, Te Rangi Pumamao was the rangatira at Parewahawaha. He had finished construction of the house, as previous builders had died.

In October 2020, the Government committed $1,248,067 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae and five others, creating 69 jobs.

==Demographics==
Bulls covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Bulls had a population of 2,055 at the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 120 people (6.0%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 465 people (25.5%) since the 2013 census. There were 879 households, while the median age was 32.8 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally), with 462 people (22.5%) aged under 15 years, 444 (21.6%) aged 15 to 29, 873 (42.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 275 (13.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 79.7% European/Pākehā, 28.3% Māori, 7.2% Pacific peoples, 3.9% Asian, and 2.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 15, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 6.15% had no religion, 25.0% were Christian, 1.9% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.7% were Hindu, 0.6% were Muslim, 0.4% were Buddhist and 1.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 169 (8.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 427 (20.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median household income was $88,000, compared with $97,000 nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1171 (57%) people were employed full-time, 189 (9.2%) were part-time, and 74 (3.6%) were unemployed.

==Government and politics==
===Local government===

As part of the Rangitikei District, the current Mayor of Rangitikei since 2013 is Andy Watson.

Bulls is the main town in the Southern ward of the Rangitikei District Council, which elects two of the eleven district councillors.

===National government===
Bulls, like the rest of the Rangitikei District, is located in the general electorate of Rangitīkei and the Māori electorate of Te Tai Hauāuru. Rangitīkei is a safe National Party seat since the 1938 election except for 1978–1984 when it was held by Bruce Beetham of the Social Credit Party. Since 2023 it has been held by Suze Redmayne

Te Tai Hauāuru is a more unstable seat, having been held by three different parties since 1996, i.e. New Zealand First, Te Pāti Māori and the Labour Party. Since 2023 it has been held by Debbie Ngarewa-Packer of Te Pāti Māori.

==Military presence==
Many Air Force personnel from RNZAF Base Ohakea live in Bulls. In recent years several defence houses have been sold to civilian buyers which has seen a steady decline of servicemen from the area, but a moderate presence remains nonetheless.

In 2017 it was announced that the Republic of Singapore Air Force is looking at establishing a permanent F-15 fighter jet training base at Ohakea with an estimated presence of 500 Singaporean personnel. Ohakea and surrounding areas such as Bulls and Feilding would see a significant increase in military families and personnel to the area. In December 2018 it was announced that this would no longer go ahead.

In 2018 the incumbent government announced the purchase of four Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft for maritime surveillance. This announcement came with the news that the current New Zealand Defence Force unit responsible for maritime surveillance, No. 5 Squadron RNZAF, would be required to move to RNZAF Base Ohakea. This move would see a further increase in the number of service personnel living in the area. RNZAF took delivery of these aircraft in 2023.

==Education ==

Bulls has two co-educational state primary schools for Year 1–8 students.

Bulls School was established in 1867 and is the oldest school in the Rangitikei District; it has a roll of as of .

Clifton School, which opened more recently on the southern end of the township, has a roll of 159.

The nearest state secondary school (year 9–13) is Rangitikei College, away in Marton.

==Climate==

==Sister city==
The town&#x27;s sister city is Cowes, England.

<doc id="808876" wikidata="Q2513013" url="?curid=808876" title="Euhemerism">
<text>In the fields of philosophy and mythography, euhemerism () is an approach to the interpretation of mythology in which mythological accounts are presumed to have originated from real historical events or personages. Euhemerism supposes that historical accounts become myths as they are exaggerated in the retelling, accumulating elaborations and alterations that reflect cultural mores. It was named after the Greek mythographer Euhemerus, who lived in the late 4th century BC. In the more recent literature of myth, such as &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot;, euhemerism is termed the &quot;historical theory&quot; of mythology.

Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology in historical terms: euhemeristic views are found in earlier writings including those of Sanchuniathon, Xenophanes, Herodotus, Hecataeus of Abdera and Ephorus. However, the enduring influence of Euhemerus upon later thinkers such as the classical poet Ennius (b. 239 BC) and modern author Antoine Banier (b. 1673 AD) identified him as the traditional founder of this school of thought.

In a scene described in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, Socrates offers a euhemeristic interpretation of a myth concerning Boreas and Orithyia:

Socrates illustrates a euhemeristic approach to the myth of Boreas abducting Orithyia. He shows how the story of Boreas, the northern wind, can be rationalised: Orithyia is pushed off the rock cliffs through the equation of Boreas with a natural gust of wind, which accepts Orithyia as a historical personage. But here he also implies that this is equivalent to rejecting the myth. Socrates, despite holding some euhemeristic views, mocked the concept that all myths could be rationalized, noting that the mythical creatures of &quot;absurd forms&quot; such as Centaurs and the Chimera could not easily be explained.

In the ancient skeptic philosophical tradition of Theodorus of Cyrene and the Cyrenaics, Euhemerus forged a new method of interpretation for the contemporary religious beliefs. Though his work is lost, the reputation of Euhemerus was that he believed that much of Greek mythology could be interpreted as natural or historical events subsequently given supernatural characteristics through retelling. Subsequently, Euhemerus was considered to be an atheist by his opponents, most notably Callimachus.

===Deification===

Euhemerus&#x27; views were rooted in the deification of men, usually kings, into gods through apotheosis. In numerous cultures, kings were exalted or venerated into the status of divine beings and worshipped after their death, or sometimes even while they ruled. Dion, the tyrant ruler of Syracuse, was deified while he was alive and modern scholars consider his apotheosis to have influenced Euhemerus&#x27; views on the origin of all gods. Euhemerus was also living during the contemporaneous deification of the Seleucids and &quot;pharaoization&quot; of the Ptolemies in a fusion of Hellenic and Egyptian traditions.

===Tomb of Zeus===

Euhemerus argued that Zeus was a mortal king who died on Crete, and that his tomb could still be found there with the inscription bearing his name. This claim however did not originate with Euhemerus, as the general sentiment of Crete during the time of Epimenides of Knossos (c. 600 BC) was that Zeus was buried somewhere in Crete. For this reason, the Cretans were often considered atheists, and Epimenides called them all liars (see Epimenides paradox). Callimachus, an opponent of Euhemerus&#x27; views on mythology, argued that Zeus&#x27; Cretan tomb was fabricated, and that he was eternal:

A later Latin scholium on the &quot;Hymns&quot; of Callimachus attempted to account for the tomb of Zeus. According to the scholium, the original tomb inscription read: &quot;The tomb of Minos, the son of Jupiter&quot; but over time the words &quot;Minos, the son&quot; wore away leaving only &quot;the tomb of Jupiter&quot;. This had misled the Cretans into thinking that Zeus had died and was buried there.

Influenced by Euhemerus, Porphyry in the 3rd century AD claimed that Pythagoras had discovered the tomb of Zeus on Crete and written on the tomb&#x27;s surface an inscription reading: &quot;Here died and was buried Zan, whom they call Zeus&quot;. Varro also wrote about the tomb of Zeus.

==Christianity==

Hostile to paganism, the early Christians, such as the Church Fathers, embraced euhemerism in attempt to undermine the validity of pagan gods. The usefulness of euhemerist views to early Christian apologists may be summed up in Clement of Alexandria&#x27;s triumphant cry in &quot;Cohortatio ad gentes&quot;: &quot;Those to whom you bow were once men like yourselves.&quot;

===The Book of Wisdom===
The &quot;Wisdom of Solomon&quot;, a deuterocanonical book, has a passage giving a euhemerist explanation of the origin of idols.
===Early Christian apologists===

The early Christian apologists deployed the euhemerist argument to support their position that pagan mythology was merely an aggregate of fables of human invention. Cyprian, a North African convert to Christianity, wrote a short essay (&quot;On the Vanity of Idols&quot;) in 247 AD that assumes the euhemeristic rationale as though it needed no demonstration. Cyprian begins:

Cyprian proceeds directly to examples, the apotheosis of Melicertes and Leucothea; &quot;The Castors [i.e. Castor and Pollux] die by turns, that they may live&quot;, a reference to the daily sharing back and forth of their immortality by the Heavenly Twins. &quot;The cave of Jupiter is to be seen in Crete, and his sepulchre is shown&quot;, Cyprian says, confounding Zeus and Dionysus but showing that the Minoan cave cult was still alive in Crete in the third century AD. In his exposition, it is to Cyprian&#x27;s argument to marginalize the syncretism of pagan belief, in order to emphasize the individual variety of local deities:

Eusebius in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; employed euhemerism to argue the Babylonian God Baʿal was a deified ruler and that the god Belus was the first Assyrian king.

Euhemeristic views are found expressed also in Tertullian (), the &quot;Octavius&quot; of Marcus Minucius Felix and in Origen. Arnobius&#x27; dismissal of paganism in the fifth century, on rationalizing grounds, may have depended on a reading of Cyprian, with the details enormously expanded. Isidore of Seville, compiler of the most influential early medieval encyclopedia, devoted a chapter to elucidating, with numerous examples and elaborated genealogies of gods, the principle drawn from Lactantius, (&quot;Those whom pagans claim to be gods were once mere men&quot;). Elaborating logically, he attempted to place these deified men in the six great periods of history as he divided it, and created mythological dynasties. Isidore&#x27;s euhemeristic bent was codified in a rigid parallel with sacred history in Petrus Comestor&#x27;s appendix to his much translated (written c. 1160), further condensing Isidore to provide strict parallels of figures from the pagan legend, as it was now viewed in historicised narrative, and the mighty human spirits of the patriarchs of the Old Testament. Martin of Braga, in his , wrote that idolatry stemmed from post-deluge survivors of Noah&#x27;s family, who began to worship the sun and stars instead of God. In his view, the Greek gods were deified descendants of Noah who were once real personages.

===Middle Ages===

Christian writers during the Middle Ages continued to embrace euhemerism, such as Vincent of Beauvais, Petrus Comestor, Roger Bacon and Godfrey of Viterbo. According to John Daniel Cooke, medieval Christian scholars embraced euhemerism because they believed that: 

While in most respects the ancient Greeks and Roman had been superior to themselves, they had been in error regarding their religious beliefs. An examination of the principal writings in Middle English with considerable reading of literature other than English, discloses the fact that the people of the Middle Ages rarely regarded the so-called gods as mere figments of the imagination but rather believed that they were or had been real beings, sometimes possessing actual power.
Other scholars have wrote that:

It was during this time that Christian apologists had adopted the views of the rationalist Greek philosophers. And had captured the purpose for Euhemerism, which was to explain the mundane origins of the Hellenistic divinities. Euhemerism explained simply in two ways: first in the strictest sense as a movement which reflected the known views of Euhemerus&#x27; Hiera Anagraphe regarding Panchaia and the historicity of the family of Saturn and Uranus. The principal sources of these views are the handed-down accounts of Lactantius and Diodorus; or second, in the widest sense, as a rationalist movement which sought to explain the mundane origins of all the Hellenistic gods and heroes as mortals.
==Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;euhemerism&quot;==
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, composed around 1220, the Christian Icelandic bard and historian Snorri Sturluson proposes that the Norse gods were originally historical leaders and kings. Odin, the father of the gods, is introduced as a historical person originally from Asia Minor, tracing his ancestry back to Priam, the king of Troy during the Trojan War.

As Odin travels north to settle in the Nordic countries, he establishes the royal families ruling in Denmark, Sweden and Norway at the time:

Snorri&#x27;s euhemerism follows the early Christian tradition.

==In the modern world==
Euhemeristic interpretations of mythology continued throughout the early modern period from the 16th century, to modern times. In 1711, the French historian Antoine Banier in his (&quot;The Mythology and Fables of the Ancients, Explained&quot;) presented strong arguments for a euhemerist interpretation of Greek mythology. Jacob Bryant&#x27;s &quot;A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology&quot; (1744) was also another key work on euhemerism of the period, but argued so from a Biblical basis. Of the early 19th century, George Stanley Faber was another Biblical euhemerist. His work &quot;The Origin of Pagan Idolatry&quot; (1816) proposed that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were all deified men. Outside of Biblical influenced literature, some archaeologists embraced euhemerist views since they discovered myths could verify archaeological findings. Heinrich Schliemann was a prominent archaeologist of the 19th century who argued myths had historical truths embedded in them. Schliemann was an advocate of the historical reality of places and characters mentioned in the works of Homer. He excavated Troy and claimed to have discovered artifacts associated with various figures from Greek mythology, including the Mask of Agamemnon and Priam&#x27;s Treasure.
Herbert Spencer embraced some euhemeristic arguments in attempt to explain the anthropocentric origin of religion, through ancestor worship. Rationalizing methods of interpretation that treat some myths as traditional accounts based upon historical events are a continuous feature of some modern readings of mythology.

The twentieth century poet and mythographer Robert Graves offered many such &quot;euhemerist&quot; interpretations in his telling of &quot;The White Goddess&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; (1955). His suggestions that such myths record and justify the political and religious overthrow of earlier cult systems have been widely criticized and are rejected by most scholars.

===Euhemerization===
Author Richard Carrier defines &quot;euhemerization&quot; as &quot;the taking of a cosmic god and placing him at a definite point in history as an actual person who was later deified&quot;.

In this framing, rather than being &quot;presumed&quot; to have originated from real historical events or personages, the mythological accounts are &quot;claimed&quot; to have had such origins, and historical accounts invented accordingly – such that, counter to the usual sense of &quot;Euhemerism&quot;, in &quot;euhemerization&quot; a mythological figure is in fact transformed into a (pseudo)historical one.

<doc id="808904" wikidata="Q4697542" url="?curid=808904" title="Ainu Association of Hokkaido">
<text>The is an umbrella group of which most Hokkaidō Ainu and some other Ainu are members. Originally controlled by the government with the intention of speeding Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese nation state, it now operates independently of the government and is run exclusively by Ainu. The group has been influential in raising public awareness of Ainu issues.

== History ==
In August of 1945, Japan experienced a significant military loss which led to Japan losing a good portion of their colonies but still kept Hokkaido as one of its territories. The Ainu believed that this new circumstance could potentially free them from suppression. This led to the establishment of the Hokkaido Ainu Association which continues to be the most prominent Ainu organisation.

The central goals of the association, in general, was to improve welfare, agricultural and fishing methods as well as education. This consisted of goals intending to restore control of certain pieces of land such as in Ashahikawa which had been promised to the Ainu or land that had been given to them under the post-war Agricultural Land Act.

After the military defeat experienced by Japan, their positioning on racial and ethnic diversity changed to advocate for a culturally homogenous state. This meant that any ethnic or cultural differences were viewed negatively leading to Japan to exert pressure on the Ainu to adopt and assimilate into mainstream Japanese customs. It was originally established in 1930 under the name . Since 1961 &quot;utari&quot; (meaning &#x27;friend&#x27;) has been used instead of &quot;Ainu&quot;. This was because many members believed &quot;Ainu&quot; was term that was received negatively. The organization&#x27;s name was changed back to Hokkaido Ainu Association in early 2009. From 1964 to 1996, its executive director was Giichi Nomura.

== Development ==
After years of the suppression of Ainu culture, there is currently a large advocation for Ainu cultural revitalisation. Ainu cultural revitalisation is commonly linked to keeping what remains of the culture as well as recovering what has been lost. Currently, the Hokkaido Ainu Association supports holding traditional cultural activities which involves Ainu Hokkaido-based groups - that promote the preservation of their culture - to come together in each community and participate in these activities.

<text>Nian Gengyao (1679 – January 13, 1726), courtesy name Lianggong, was a Chinese military commander of the Qing dynasty. He was born a member of the Han Chinese Bordered Yellow Banner and had extensive military experience on the western frontier of the Qing Empire. Nian became commander-in-chief of the Qing armies in the northwest; and helped to incorporate the region of what is now Qinghai into the Qing Empire.

==Life==
Nian&#x27;s father, Nian Xialing (年遐齡), served as Viceroy of Huguang from 1692 to 1704. Nian himself was a &quot;jinshi&quot; in 1700 and was selected a bachelor of the Hanlin Academy. In March 1709, the Banner company to which the Nian family belonged was assigned to serve the prince Yinzhen, who later became the Yongzheng Emperor. About the same time a sister of Nian Gengyao, Imperial Noble Consort Dunsu, became a concubine of Yinzhen.

In October 1709, Nian was appointed Governor of Sichuan and gradually came to the notice of the Kangxi Emperor. During the 16 years of his administration, he quelled several uprisings of the aborigines west of Sichuan. In 1718, he was made Governor-General of Sichuan and was given power to direct military affairs. Following the appointment of Yinti, another of the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s sons, as Border Pacification General-in-chief, there were suggestions about Nian&#x27;s loyalty to Yinzhen. As General Who Secures the West (定西將軍), Nian Gengyao took an active part in supplying Yinti&#x27;s campaign in Tibet against Tsewang Rabtan. In June 1721, he was granted an audience with the elderly Kangxi Emperor at Rehe and subsequently raised to the rank of Governor-General of Sichuan and Shaanxi.

In December 1722, the Kangxi Emperor died and Yinzhen ascended the throne as the Yongzheng Emperor. He granted an audience to Nian Gengyao early in 1723 and awarded him a minor hereditary rank and the title of Grand Guardian, and made his elder brother Nian Xiyao (年希堯) Governor of Guangdong. A few months later, as reward for his help in ejecting the Dzungars from Tibet, Nian was elevated to a duke of the third class. The emperor was uncharacteristically informal with him and promoted friendship between Longkodo and Nian.

In 1723, Nian became commander-in-chief of the forces sent to quell the uprising of the Khoshotes of Qinghai under Lobdzan Dandzin. With the help of the general Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of Yue Fei), Nian won several victories over the rebels and in a few months quelled the revolt, adding Qinghai to the Qing Empire. Nian was thereupon raised to a Duke of the First Class. When Nian made a visit to Beijing in late 1724, and paid his respects to the Yongzheng Emperor, he was given additional honours and privileges normally granted to a Prince of the First Rank. His attitude, however, aroused hatred and jealousy, and many officials submitted memorials hostile to Nian.

Nian himself was not slow to discover that he had lost imperial favour, for on his return to Xi&#x27;an in January 1725 he submitted a memorial of his own, protesting his loyalty and imploring the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s mercy. Meanwhile; it was discovered that Nian had engaged in secret correspondence with Yintang, the emperor&#x27;s brother and political rival. His plea for leave being denied, Nian was, at the end of May, transferred to the post of Tartar General at Hangzhou. The armies he once commanded went under the control of Yue Zhongqi. As accusations accumulated from his former friends and officials, Nian was in a few months progressively degraded in rank until he became merely a bannerman-at-large. In November, he was arrested and taken under escort to Beijing. Early in 1726, his crimes were enumerated under 92 heads, and Nian was sentenced to be executed. The Yongzheng Emperor granted him the privilege of committing suicide but his eldest son, Nian Fu (年富), was beheaded and his other sons were banished.

Nian is credited with three works on military tactics: &quot;General Nian&#x27;s Art of War&quot; () among others, but all were apparently written by others and falsely attributed to him.

He was married to the Imperial Duke Who Assists the State (宗室輔國公) Aisin Gioro Suyan&#x27;s (蘇燕) daughter and to the Manchu Plain Yellow Bannerman Nalan Xingde&#x27;s daughter.

<text>In chemistry, pyran is a six-membered heterocyclic, non-aromatic ring, consisting of five carbon atoms and one oxygen atom and containing two double bonds. The molecular formula is C5H6O. There are two isomers of pyran that differ by the location of the double bonds. In 2&quot;H&quot;-pyran, the saturated carbon is at position 2, whereas, in 4&quot;H&quot;-pyran, the saturated carbon is at position 4. It must be noted that “oxine” must not be used for pyran because it has been used as a trivial name for quinolin-8-ol.

4&quot;H&quot;-Pyran was first isolated and characterized in 1962 via pyrolysis of 2-acetoxy-3,4-dihydro-2&quot;H&quot;-pyran. It was found to be unstable, particularly in the presence of air. 4&quot;H&quot;-pyran easily disproportionates to the corresponding dihydropyran and the pyrylium ion, which is easily hydrolyzed in aqueous medium.

Although the pyrans themselves have little significance in chemistry, many of their derivatives are important biological molecules, such as the pyranoflavonoids.

The term pyran is also often applied to the saturated ring analog, which is more properly referred to as tetrahydropyran (oxane). In this context, the monosaccharides containing a six-membered ring system are known as pyranoses.

<text>The CZ 52 (also known by the Czechoslovak military designations vz. 52, for (vz. - &quot;vzor&quot; = model) &quot;model of 1952&quot;, and CZ 482) is a semi-automatic pistol designed by two brothers, Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl, in the early 1950s for the Czechoslovak military. Around 200,000 vz. 52s were made by Česká Zbrojovka in Strakonice from 1952 to 1954. Before standardizing on the 7.62×25mm vz. 52, the Czechoslovak military used several domestic and foreign pistol models in three different calibers. After 30 years of military service, the vz. 52 was eventually replaced by the 9×18mm Makarov caliber vz. 82.

The CZ 52 is technically known as the vz. 52; the Czech military designation. It&#x27;s often referred to as the CZ 52 to differentiate it from the vz. 52 rifle, which entered the export market before the pistol.

==Description==
The CZ 52 pistol is a roller-locked short recoil–operated, detachable box magazine–fed, single-action, semi-automatic pistol chambered for the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge (the gun was originally designed for 9×19mm Parabellum caliber but due to political pressures had to be redesigned for the then-standard Soviet pistol cartridge). It weighs approximately two pounds unloaded. Military models feature either a parkerized finish or a gray oxide coating, while some CZ 52s were arsenal reblued in the 1970s. These re-finished guns are usually marked as such.

Ergonomically, the grip of the CZ 52 is long when measured from front to rear and slim from side to side with a low &quot;hump&quot; which meets the web of the hand at the rear. It also has a high bore axis which increases felt recoil.

==Operation==
The CZ 52&#x27;s operating controls consist of a single-action trigger, an external hammer, a magazine catch located at the heel of the grip frame, and a combination de-cock/safety lever located on the left rear side of the receiver aft of the left grip panel. The manual safety blocks movement of the sear, which prevents the hammer from releasing and firing a round. A second safety, in the form of a spring-loaded firing pin block, prevents the pistol from firing unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear; this feature renders the pistol &quot;drop safe&quot;. However, if the firing pin block spring has become worn, the pistol may be rendered unsafe in the event of a muzzle down drop, or in the case of other internals being worn, it may be drop safe only when &quot;cocked and locked&quot;, for instance. Care should be taken when handling firearms of uncertain origin, and only a competent gunsmith should be relied upon to verify the safety mechanisms of surplus guns are intact. Because the sear must overcome the additional spring pressure of the firing pin block, an inherent feature of the CZ 52 is its unusually heavy trigger pull, often in the range. The hammer is of the rebounding type, meaning that it does not contact the firing pin while in its uncocked position, and cannot do so unless the trigger is pulled, another safety feature. Using the decocker relies on the integrity of the firing pin block; if the firing pin block is worn, an unintentional discharge can result when the decocker is engaged. Because of this, the decocker is considered to be unreliable and its usage is not recommended.

After a full magazine is inserted, the slide is fully retracted and released. This action cocks the hammer, strips a cartridge from the magazine, and chambers it. Rotating the three-position safety lever fully downward, exposing a red warning dot between the receiver and the hammer pivot pin, renders the pistol ready to fire. Rotating the lever upward to its center position covers the red dot and engages the sear block (allowing &quot;cocked and locked&quot; carry). Finally, rotating the safety lever fully upward decocks the hammer by releasing the sear and intercepting the hammer&#x27;s forward movement. This position allows safe carry of the pistol with a round in the chamber. The hammer must then be cocked manually and the safety disengaged before a round can be fired. As the trigger is pulled in this state, the trigger bar rotates the sear, a lug on the sear disengages the firing pin safety located directly above it, and the opposite side of the sear releases the hammer. The hammer then impacts the firing pin, the firing pin impacts the primer of the cartridge, and the shot is fired.

The CZ 52 utilizes a fairly uncommon variety of the short recoil operating system in which two vertical rollers are used to lock the barrel and slide together, via a cam block. This is similar to the system used in the German MG 42 general-purpose machine gun. This arrangement results in a strong lockup which, conventional wisdom holds, allows the loading of higher pressure ammunition (such as ammunition intended for use in a submachine gun) with higher velocity and energy than compatible ammunition manufactured for pistols of a similar caliber in other Warsaw Pact countries. In practice, however, the rollers were generally poorly heat treated resulting in them deforming and grinding against the inside of the slide and frame; an issue that can cause both to crack if not addressed. The firing pin and extractor have similar problems with heat treatment; it is recommended to replace them with aftermarket parts.

When cocked, loaded, and closed; the recoil spring, positioned coaxially around the barrel, provides the pressure necessary to lock the barrel and slide together via the rollers. When a round is discharged, the barrel and slide recoil together while the cam block is held stationary by a lug in the receiver. After traveling rearward a short distance (about 0.16&quot; or 4 mm), the rollers are allowed to disengage from the slide via recesses in the cam block. At this point, the slide is free to continue rearward, cocking the hammer, extracting the spent case from the barrel&#x27;s chamber, and ejecting it clear of the pistol. After reaching the end of its stroke, the slide is returned to cocked and loaded by the compressed recoil spring, again collecting a fresh cartridge from the magazine and inserting it into the chamber.

When the magazine is empty its follower presses against an externally mounted slide catch and holds the slide open. The slide catch can be manually engaged by pressing up on the exposed bar. The magazine catch is located at the heel of the pistol grip. It is pulled toward the backstrap to release the magazine from the well. A potential problem arises in that there is now minimal pressure on the magazine spring and the magazine catch is under constant pressure from the mainspring, forcing it into contact with the rear of the magazine. This means that magazines do not drop free and occasionally take a few seconds to remove from the pistol. Releasing the slide catch is done by removing the empty magazine (or inserting a loaded one), then retracting the slide and releasing it. There is no thumb-operated lever to release the slide (although an aftermarket slide release lever is available).

==Ammunition==
By the late 1990s, after the popularity of the surplus CZ 52 had started to increase, hollow-point ammunition in 7.62×25mm became available from custom shops. The pistol proved capable of handling extremely &quot;hot&quot; loadings, and many shops sell custom or hand-loaded ammunition.

Replacement barrels were available to change the caliber to 9×19mm Parabellum. Doing so provides a much wider range of ammunition choices, at the cost of a significant drop in power.

<text>King Features Syndicate, Inc. is an American content distribution and animation studio, consumer product licensing and print syndication company owned by Hearst Communications that distributes about 150 comic strips, newspaper columns, editorial cartoons, puzzles, and games to nearly 5,000 newspapers worldwide. King Features Syndicate also produces intellectual properties, develops new content and franchises (like &quot;The Cuphead Show!&quot;, which it produced with Netflix), and licenses its classic characters and properties.

King Features Syndicate is a unit of Hearst Holdings, Inc., which combines the Hearst Corporation&#x27;s cable-network partnerships, television programming and distribution activities, and syndication companies. King Features&#x27; affiliate syndicates are North America Syndicate and Cowles Syndicate.

== History ==

William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s newspapers began syndicating material in 1895 after receiving requests from other newspapers. The first official Hearst syndicate was called Newspaper Feature Service, Inc., established in 1913. In 1914, Hearst and his manager Moses Koenigsberg consolidated all of Hearst&#x27;s syndication enterprises under one banner (although Newspaper Feature Service was still in operation into at least the 1930s). Koenigsberg gave it his own name (the German word &quot;&quot; means &quot;king&quot;) when he launched King Features Syndicate on November 16, 1915.
Production escalated in 1916 with King Features buying and selling its own staff-created feature material. A trade publication — &quot;Circulation&quot; — was published by King Features between 1916 and 1933. In January 1929, the world-famous Popeye character was introduced in King Features&#x27; &quot;Thimble Theater&quot; comic strip.

King Features had a series of hits during the 1930s with the launch of &quot;Blondie&quot; (1930–present), &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1934–2003 Note: Relaunched again in October 2023 by Dan Schkade as a daily and Sunday strip), &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; (1934–2013), and &quot;The Phantom&quot; (1936–present). In March 1936, a fictional, magical animal called Eugene the Jeep was added to Popeye, and trademarked.

King Features remained a &quot;powerhouse&quot; syndicate throughout the 1950s and the 1960s. In 1965 it launched a children&#x27;s comic and coloring page.

In 1986, King Features acquired the Register and Tribune Syndicate for $4.3 million. Later that year, Hearst bought News America Syndicate (formerly Publishers-Hall). By this point, with both King Features and News America (renamed North America Syndicate), Hearst led all syndication services with 316 features.

In 2007, King Features donated its collection of comic-strip proof sheets (two sets of over 60 years&#x27; accumulation) to the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum and the Michigan State University Comic Art Collection while retaining the collection in electronic form for reference purposes.

In November 2015, King Features released a book, entitled &quot;King of the Comics: One Hundred Years of King Features Syndicate&quot; to commemorate its 100th anniversary. The book features a compilation of strips and the histories behind King Features strips.

As of 2016, with 62 strips being syndicated, Hearst was considered the second-largest comics service, second only to Uclick (now known as Andrews McMeel Syndication).

In December 2017, King Features appointed CJ Kettler as president of the company. Kettler previously was CEO of Sunbow Entertainment and the executive producer of the Netflix series &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot;.

== William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s involvement ==

In 1941, King Features manager Moses Koenigsberg wrote an autobiographical history of the company entitled &quot;King News&quot;. William Randolph Hearst paid close attention to the comic strips, even in the last years of his life, as is evident in these 1945–46 correspondence excerpts, originally in &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; (December 1946), about the creation of &quot;Dick&#x27;s Adventures in Dreamland&quot; — a strip that made its debut on Sunday, January 12, 1947; written by former &quot;Daily News&quot; reporter Max Trell and illustrated by Neil O&#x27;Keefe (who also drew for King Features a strip based on Edgar Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Inspector Wade of Scotland Yard&quot;):

: Hearst to King Features president J. D. Gortatowsky (December 28, 1945): &quot;I have had numerous suggestions for incorporating some American history of a vivid kind in the adventure strips of the comic section. The difficulty is to find something that will sufficiently interest the kids… Perhaps a title — &quot;Trained by Fate&quot; — would be general enough. Take Paul Revere and show him as a boy making as much of his boyhood life as possible, and culminate, of course, with his ride. Take Betsy Ross for a heroine, or Barbara Fritchie… for the girls.&quot;

: King Features editor Ward Greene to Hearst: &quot;There is another way to do it, which is somewhat fantastic, but which I submit for your consideration. That is to devise a new comic… a &quot;dream&quot; idea revolving around a boy we might call Dick. Dick, or his equivalent, would go in his dream with Mad Anthony Wayne at the storming of Stony Point or with Decatur at Tripoli… [This would] provide a constant character… who would become known to the kids.&quot;

: Hearst to Greene: &quot;The dream idea for the American history series is splendid. It gives continuity and personal interest, and you can make more than one page of each series… You are right about the importance of the artist.&quot;

: Greene to Hearst (enclosing samples): &quot;We employed the dream device, building the comic around a small boy.&quot;

: Hearst: &quot;I think the drawing of &quot;Dick and His Dad&quot; is amazingly good. It is perfectly splendid. I am afraid, however, that similar beginning and conclusion of each page might give a deadly sameness to the series… Perhaps we could get the dream idea over by having only the conclusion on each page. I mean, do not show the boy going to sleep every time and then show him waking up, but let the waking up come as a termination to each page… Can you develop anything out of the idea of having Dick the son of the keeper of the Liberty Statue in New York Harbor? I do not suggest this, as it would probably add further complications, but it might give a spiritual tie to all the dreams. The main thing, however, is to get more realism.&quot;

: Greene: &quot;We do not have to show the dream at the beginning and end of every page… If we simply call the comic something like &quot;Dreamer Dick&quot;, we would have more freedom… Some device other than the dream might be used… A simple method would be to have him curl up with a history book.&quot;

: Hearst: &quot;If we find [the first series] is not a success, of course we can brief it, but if it is a success it should be a long series.&quot;

: Greene: &quot;I am sending you two sample pages of &quot;Dick&#x27;s Adventures in Dreamland&quot; which start a series about Christopher Columbus.&quot;

: Hearst: &quot;In January, I am told, we are going to 16 pages regularly on &quot;Puck, the Comic Weekly&quot;. That would be a good time to introduce the Columbus series, don&#x27;t you think so?&quot;

The last strips Hearst personally selected for syndication were Elliot Caplin &amp; John Cullen Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Big Ben Bolt&quot; and Mort Walker&#x27;s &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;; Hearst died in 1951.

== Editors ==
In the 1940s, Ward Greene (1893–1956) was King Features&#x27; editor, having worked his way up through the ranks. He was a reporter and war correspondent for the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; for four years (1913–17), moving to the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; in 1917 and then returning to the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; as correspondent in France and Germany (1918–19). He joined King Features in 1920, became a writer and editor of the magazine section in 1925, advancing to executive editor and general manager.

Vice president Bradley Kelly (1894–1969) was a comics editor during the 1940s.

Sylvan Byck (1904–1982) was head editor of the syndicate&#x27;s comics features for several decades, from the 1950s until his retirement in 1978. A King Features employee for more than 40 years and comics editor for 33 years, Byck was 78 when he died July 8, 1982. Comic-strip artist John Celardo (1918–2012) began as a King comics editor in 1973.

In 1973, Tom Pritchard (1928–1992) joined King Features, and became executive editor in 1990, overseeing daily editorial operations and the development of political cartoons, syndicated columns, and editorial services for King Features and North America Syndicate. Born in Bronxville, New York, Pritchard arrived at King Features after work as a reporter at &quot;The Record-Journal&quot; (Meriden, Connecticut), as feature writer with &quot;The Hartford Times&quot;, as editor-publisher of Connecticut&#x27;s weekly &quot;Wethersfield Post&quot;, and as executive editor of &quot;The Manchester Journal Inquirer&quot; in Connecticut. He died of a heart attack in December 1992 at his home in Norwalk.

In 1978, cartoonist Bill Yates (1921–2001) took over as King Features&#x27; comics editor. He had previously edited Dell Publishing&#x27;s cartoon magazines (&quot;1000 Jokes&quot;, &quot;Ballyhoo&quot;, &quot;For Laughing Out Loud&quot;) and Dell&#x27;s paperback cartoon collections. Yates resigned from King Features at the end of 1988 to spend full-time on his cartooning, and he died March 26, 2001.

In 1988, Yates was replaced by Jay Kennedy — author of &quot;The Official Underground &amp; Newave Comix Price Guide&quot; (Norton Boatner, 1982). Kennedy was King Features&#x27; lead editor until March 15, 2007, when he drowned in a riptide while vacationing in Costa Rica.

Brendan Burford, who attended the School of Visual Arts, was employed for a year as an editorial assistant at DC Comics before joining King Features as an editorial assistant in January 2000. Working closely with Jay Kennedy over a seven-year span, he was promoted to associate editor and then, after Kennedy&#x27;s death, to the position of comics editor on April 23, 2007.

In November 2018, Tea Fougner was promoted to editorial director for comics after working as an editor at King Features for nine years. She is the first female-assigned and first genderqueer person to oversee comics editorial at King Features.

== Strip submissions ==
When asked to speak in public, Byck made a point of telling audiences that King Features received more than 1,000 strip proposals annually, but chose only one each year. However, in Syd Hoff&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cartooning&quot; (Stravon, 1973), Byck offered some tips regarding strip submissions, including the creation of central characters with warmth and charm and the avoidance of &quot;themes that are too confining,&quot; as he explained: 
: Although characterization is the most important element of a comic, the cartoonist also must cope with the problem of choosing a theme for his new strip. What will it be about? Actually, it is possible to do a successful comic strip about almost anything or anybody if the writing and drawing are exactly right for the chosen subject. In general, though, it is best to stay away from themes that are too confining. If you achieve your goal of syndication, you want your strip to last a long time. You don&#x27;t want to run out of ideas after a few weeks or months. In humor strips, it is better to build around a character than around a job. For example, it is possible to do some very funny comic strip gags about a taxi driver. But a strip that is limited to taxi driver gags is bound to wear thin pretty fast. I&#x27;d rather see a strip about a warmly funny man who just happens to earn his living as a cabbie and whose job is only a minor facet of his potential for inspiring gags. Narrative strips can be and often are based on the central character&#x27;s job. For example, the basis of a private eye strip is the work he does. But even here the strip will only be as successful as the characterization in it. The big question is: what kind of a man is this particular private eye?

== Content distribution ==
King Features Syndicate&#x27;s content distribution division distributes more than 150 different comics, games, puzzles, and columns, in digital and print formats, to nearly 5,000 daily, Sunday, weekly and online newspapers and other publishers. Comic properties include Beetle Bailey, Blondie, Dennis the Menace, The Family Circus, Curtis, Rhymes with Orange, Arctic Circle, Macanudo, and Zits. The division additionally offers services for smaller publishers and community papers, including pagination and colorization services through its sister company, RBMA.

In March 2018, to mark International Women&#x27;s Day, many King Features cartoonists included messages about female empowerment and other topics that resonated with them.

In April 2020, Bianca Xunise became the first black woman to join the team of female creators behind King Features strip Six Chix. Six Chix was first syndicated by King Features in May 2019, after King Features saw strip creator Maritsa Patrinos&#x27; work online.

In June 2020, King Features started syndicating webcomic Rae the Doe. In the same month, cartoonists from King Features, along with artists from Kirkman&#x27;s, Andrews McMeel Syndication and National Cartoonists Society, hid symbols in their Sunday strips as a tribute to essential workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

In September 2020, King Features relaunched comic strip Mark Trail, originally launched in 1946, with cartoonist Jules Rivera, author of comic strip Love, Joolz, at the helm.

== Animation, comic books, and licensing ==
Many King characters were adapted to animation, both theatrical and television cartoons. Strips from King Features were often reprinted by comic book publishers. In 1967, King Features made an effort to publish comic books of its own by establishing King Comics. This short-lived comic-book line showcased King&#x27;s best-known characters in seven titles:

* Beetle Bailey
* Blondie
* Flash Gordon
* Jungle Jim
* Mandrake the Magician
* The Phantom
* Popeye

The comics imprint existed for a year-and-a-half, with titles cover-dated from August 1966 to December 1967. When it ended, the books were picked up and continued by Gold Key Comics, Harvey Comics, and Charlton Comics.

In 1967, Al Brodax, then the president of King Features, pitched The Beatles manager Brian Epstein on turning their hit song &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; into an animated movie. The film was widely considered to be the first animated film for adult audiences, despite its G-rating in United States.

In addition to extensive merchandising and licensing of such iconic characters as Betty Boop, Felix the Cat, and Popeye, King Features has diversified to handle popular animation and TV characters (from &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; and &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; to &quot;Mr. Bill&quot; and &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;), plus publicly displayed, life-sized art sculptures — &quot;CowParade&quot;, &quot;Guitarmania&quot; and &quot;The Trail of the Painted Ponies.&quot; King Features also represents David and Goliath, an apparel and accessories line popular with teenagers.

King Features additionally licenses outdoor apparel brand PURENorway, Moomins, Icelandic lifestyle brand Tulipop, ringtone character Crazy Frog and South Korean animated character PUCCA.

As a sales tool, the King Features design team created colorful strip sample folders resembling movie press kits. With rising paper costs and the downsizing of newspapers, the comic-strip arena became increasingly competitive, and by 2002, King salespeople were making in-person pitches to 1,550 daily newspapers across America. King was then receiving more than 6,000 strip submissions each year, yet it accepted only two or three annually. Interviewed in 2002 by Catherine Donaldson-Evans of Fox News, Kennedy commented:
: It is difficult for cartoonists to break into syndication, but contrary to popular understanding, there&#x27;s more new product being pitched now than 30 years ago. In that regard, there are more opportunities for new cartoonists. There&#x27;s a finite amount of space to run comic strips—less now than 50 years ago. There are fewer two-paper cities and a lot of papers have shrunk their page size. New strips can succeed. The new cartoonists just have to be that much better.

One of the first original animation projects of King Features Animation is &quot;The Cuphead Show!&quot; for Netflix, an animated series based on the video game &quot;Cuphead&quot; by Studio MDHR, known for its use of fully hand-drawn characters and animations in the style of Fleischer Studios. The series had started development since July 2019, and was released on February 18, 2022.

In June 2019, 20th Century Studios and The Walt Disney Company announced the production of an animated film based on the comic strip Flash Gordon. Taiki Waititi was attached to direct and John Davis was announced as the producer.

On May 11, 2020, it was announced that a Popeye movie is in development at King Features Syndicate with Genndy Tartakovsky coming back to the project.

In November 2020, a Hagar the Horrible animated series was announced, written by Eric Zibroski, who wrote and produced the ABC comedy &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot;.

== Digital platforms ==
=== DailyINK (2006–2013) ===
Confronted by newspaper cutbacks, King Features has explored new venues, such as placing comic strips on mobile phones. In 2006, it launched DailyINK. On a web page and via email, the DailyINK service made available more than 90 vintage and current comic strips, puzzles, and editorial cartoons. The vintage strips included &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, &quot;Buz Sawyer&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, &quot;The Little King&quot;, &quot;The Phantom&quot;, and &quot;Rip Kirby&quot;. King Features editor-in-chief Jay Kennedy introduced the service early in 2006, commenting:
With 11,000 subscribers by June 2010, more vintage strips were added to DailyINK, including &quot;Barney Google&quot;, &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;, &quot;Big Ben Bolt&quot;, &quot;Brick Bradford&quot;, &quot;The Heart of Juliet Jones&quot;, &quot;Jackys Diary&quot;, &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, &quot;Little Iodine&quot;, &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot;, &quot;Office Hours&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Radio Patrol&quot;. On November 15, 2010, a subscription rate increase to $19.99 was announced, effective December 15, 2010, with applications available on iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, plus a &quot;new and improved&quot; DailyINK in 2011. The redesign was by Blenderbox. Added features included original publication dates, a forum, and a blog, mostly promotional, but also with &quot;Ask the Archivist&quot; posts exploring comic-strip history. The &quot;Last 7&quot; feature enables the reader to see a week&#x27;s worth of comics on one page.

On January 13, 2012, the DailyINK app was voted as the People&#x27;s Champ in the Funny category in the 2011 Pixel Awards. Established in 2006, the Pixel Awards honor sites and apps displaying excellence in web design and development. Other nominees in the Funny category: JibJab Media Inc, Threaded, Snowball of Duty: White Opps and SoBe Staring Contest.

In 2012, &quot;Jackys Diary&quot; was dropped from DailyINK, and the Archivist explained: &quot;Unfortunately, we no longer have the rights to publish the strip.&quot;

In December 2013, Daily INK was relaunched as part of King Feature&#x27;s Comics Kingdom.

=== Comics Kingdom (2008–present) ===
In November 2008, King Features introduced Comics Kingdom, a digital platform that newspapers can embed on their sites. Comics Kingdom splits advertising revenue with newspapers carrying the feature; those papers make local sales, while King handles national sales. During the 30-day period in which strips are made available on the newspaper sites, readers can post comments on local community forums.

In January 2019, to commemorate Popeye&#x27;s 90th birthday, multiple King Features cartoonists drew their own versions of the comic and published those strips on Comics Kingdom. One comic included the cast of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Queer Eye&quot; giving Popeye a makeover.

In November 2019, Comics Kingdom launched a YouTube channel featuring classic cartoons from King Features archives. Before launching the channel, in December 2018, King Features launched a series of animated Popeye shorts to its primary YouTube channel, in celebration of the character&#x27;s 90th &quot;birthday.&quot;

In July 2020, comic strip &quot;Rhymes with Orange&quot; launched a virtual interactive comic with digital drawing company Mental Canvas on Comics Kingdom.

As of January 2022, Comics Kingdom features comic strips and editorial cartoons which can be accessed and read online. This website also features some interactive puzzles. Comics are updated every day, plus a one-year archive is available. Older comics can be accessed by being a Comics Kingdom Royal (a paid member, subscribed to their premium subscription service). Comics Kingdom also features over 30 of comic strips in Spanish.

=== A la Carte Online Comics ===
King&#x27;s A la Carte Online Comics offers syndication of specific strips aimed at &quot;precisely defined audiences&quot; of specialized websites. These are available in such categories as Animals, Environmental, Military, and Technology.

=== &quot;King Features Weekly Planet&quot; ===
&quot;King Features Weekly Planet&quot; was created as an online newspaper of King&#x27;s columns, comics, and puzzles.

<text>From 976 until 1246, the Margraviate of Austria and its successor, the Duchy of Austria, was ruled by the House of Babenberg. At that time, those states were part of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1246 until 1918, the duchy and its successor, the Archduchy of Austria, was ruled by the House of Habsburg. Following the defeat of Austria-Hungary in World War I, the titles were abolished or fell into abeyance with the erection of the modern Republic of Austria.

==Margraves and Dukes of Austria under the House of Babenberg==
The March of Austria, also known as &quot;Marcha Orientalis&quot;, was first formed in 976 out of the lands that had once been the March of Pannonia in Carolingian times. The oldest attestation dates back to 996, where the written name &quot;ostarrichi&quot; occurs in a document transferring land in present-day Austria to a Bavarian monastery. In 1156, the Privilegium Minus elevated the march to a duchy, independent of the Duchy of Bavaria.

==Dukes and Archdukes of Austria under the House of Habsburg==

Count Rudolf of Habsburg, elected as king of Germany (1273), was able during the years 1276–78 to decisively defeat his main rival, the Bohemian king Ottokar II, and to regain his Austrian domains back for the Empire. By his imperial authority, Rudolf later (1282) invested his sons Albrecht and Rudolf with the duchies of Austria and Styria, thereby securing them for the House of Habsburg. Austria remained under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years, forming the core of the Habsburg monarchy and the present-day country of Austria.

The most important Austrian rulers until the Victory at Vienna in 1683 are described in the book Symmetria iuridico Austriaca.

<text>Legal capacity is a quality denoting either the legal aptitude of a person to have rights and liabilities (in this sense also called transaction capacity), or the personhood itself in regard to an entity other than a natural person (in this sense also called legal personality).

==Natural persons==
Capacity covers day-to-day decisions, including: what to wear and what to buy, as well as, life-changing decisions, such as: whether to move into a care home or whether to have major surgery.

As an aspect of the social contract between a state and its citizens, the state adopts a role of protector to the weaker and more vulnerable members of society. In public policy terms, this is the policy of &quot;parens patriae&quot;. Similarly, the state has a direct social and economic interest in promoting trade, so it will define the forms of business enterprise that may operate within its territory, and lay down rules that will allow both the businesses and those that wish to contract with them a fair opportunity to gain value. This system worked well until social and commercial mobility increased. Now persons routinely trade and travel across state boundaries (both physically and electronically), so the need is to provide stability across state lines given that laws differ from one state to the next. Thus, once defined by the personal law, persons take their capacity with them like a passport whether or however they may travel. In this way, a person will not gain or lose capacity depending on the accident of the local laws, e.g. if A does not have capacity to marry her cousin under her personal law (a rule of consanguinity), she cannot evade that law by travelling to a state that does permit such a marriage (see nullity). In Saskatchewan Canada, an exception to this law allows married persons to become the common law spouse of other(s) prior to divorcing the first spouse. This law is not honored amongst other Canadian provinces.

===Legal capacity===

Standardized classes of person have had their freedom restricted. These limitations are exceptions to the general policy of freedom of contract and the detailed human and civil rights that a person of ordinary capacity might enjoy. For example, freedom of movement may be modified, the right to vote may be withdrawn, etc. As societies have developed more equal treatment based on gender, race and ethnicity, many of the older incapacities have been removed. For example, English law used to treat married women as lacking the capacity to own property or act independently of their husbands (the last of these rules was repealed by the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973, which removed the wife&#x27;s domicile of dependency for those marrying after 1974, so that a husband and wife could have different domiciles).

====Minors====

The definition of an &quot;infant&quot; or &quot;minor&quot; varies, each state reflecting local culture and prejudices in defining the age of majority, marriageable age, voting age, etc. In many jurisdictions, legal contracts, in which (at least) one of the contracting parties is a minor, are voidable by the minor. For a minor to undergo medical procedure, consent is determined by the minor&#x27;s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). The right to vote in the United States is currently set at 18 years, while the right to buy and consume alcohol is often set at 21 years by U.S. state law. Some laws, such as marriage laws, may differentiate between the sexes and allow women to marry at a younger age. There are instances in which a person may be able to gain capacity earlier than the prescribed time through a process of emancipation. Conversely, many states allow the inexperience of childhood to be an excusing condition to criminal liability and set the age of criminal responsibility to match the local experience of emerging behavioral problems (see &quot;doli incapax&quot;). For sexual crimes, the age of consent determines the potential liability of adult accused.

As an example of liability in contract, the law in most of Canada provides that an infant is not bound by the contracts he or she enters into except for the purchase of necessaries and for beneficial contracts of service. Infants must pay fair price only for necessary goods and services. However, the British Columbia &quot;Infants Act&quot; ( 1996 c.223) declares all contracts, including necessities and beneficial contracts of service, are unenforceable against an infant. Only student loans and other contracts made specifically enforceable by statute will be binding on infants in that province.

In contracts between an adult and an infant, adults are bound but infants may escape contracts at their option (i.e. the contract is voidable). Infants may ratify a contract on reaching age of majority. In the case of executed contracts, when the infant has obtained some benefit under the contract, he/she cannot avoid obligations unless what was obtained was of no value. Upon repudiation of a contract, either party can apply to the court. The court may order restitution, damages, or discharge the contract. All contracts involving the transfer of real estate are considered valid until ruled otherwise.

A minor (typically under 18) can disaffirm a contract made, no matter the case. However, the entire contract must be disaffirmed. Depending on the jurisdiction, the minor may be required to return any of the goods still in his possession. Also, barter transactions such as purchasing a retail item in exchange for a cash payment are generally recognized through a legal fiction not to be contracts due to the absence of promises of future action. A minor may not disavow such a trade.
*Disaffirmance – it must be timely. For example, a contract that goes beyond two years of reaching the age of majority would be considered ratified. Minors are still allowed to disaffirm, even if their age is misrepresented. They will not face tort violations. Some states do not allow disaffirmance if the consideration cannot be returned.
*Obligations – most states hold that a minor only must return the goods (consideration) if the goods are still in the minor&#x27;s possession. Many states are requiring that the minor restore the adult (other party) to the state they were in before the contract was made. Minors are beginning to be held responsible for damages, wear, tear, etc. of the good in question upon return. A suit for tort is considered by some states to be an enforcement of the contract and is not allowed.
*Liability – for necessities, (1) the item contracted for must be necessary for minor&#x27;s existence, (2) the value must be up to that of the current standard of living or financial/social status (not excessive in value), (3) the minor must not be under the care of a parent/guardian who is required to supply the item. A minor could be held liable for a contract for the purchase of luxury items (those that are not in the financial/social/standard of living range).
*Ratification – accepting and giving legal force to an obligation. Express ratification (for a minor) is expressly stating, orally or in writing that he/she intends to be bound by the contract. Implied ratification is when the conduct of the minor is inconsistent with that of disaffirmance or when minor fails to disaffirm an executed contract within a reasonable period.
Generally, the courts base their determination on whether the minor, after reaching the age of majority, has had ample opportunity to consider the nature of the contractual obligations he or she entered into as a minor and the extent to which the adult party to the contract has performed.
As one court put it, &quot;the purpose of the infancy doctrine is to protect &#x27;minors from foolishly squandering their wealth through improvident contracts with crafty adults who would take advantage of them in the marketplace.

In Singapore, while individuals under the age of 21 are regarded as minors, sections 35 and 36 of the Civil Law Act 1909 provide that certain contracts entered into by minors aged 18 and above are to be treated as though they were adults. Additionally, the Minors&#x27; Contracts Act 1987 as applicable in Singapore and in England and Wales provides that a contract entered into by a minor is not automatically unenforceable and that a &quot;court may, if it is just and equitable to do so, require the [minor] defendant to transfer to the plaintiff any property acquired by the defendant under the contract, or any property representing it&quot;.

====Bankruptcy====

If individuals find themselves in a situation where they can no longer pay their debts, they lose their status as credit-worthy and become bankrupt. States differ on the means whereby their outstanding liabilities can be treated as discharged and on the precise extent of the limits that are placed on their capacities during this time but, after discharge, they are returned to full capacity. In the United States, some states have spendthrift laws under which an irresponsible spender may be deemed to lack capacity to enter into contracts (in Europe, these are termed prodigality laws) and both sets of laws may be denied extraterritorial effect under public policy as imposing a potentially penal status on the individuals affected.

====Enemy aliens and/or terrorists====
During times of war or civil strife, a state will limit the ability of its citizens to offer help or assistance in any form to those who are acting against the interests of the state. Hence, all commercial and other contracts with the &quot;enemy&quot;, including terrorists, would be considered void or suspended until a cessation of hostilities is agreed.

===Mental capacity===

====Insanity, mental illness, or mental/medical condition====

Loss of mental capacity occurs in individuals may have an inherent physical condition that prevents them from achieving the normal levels of performance expected from persons of comparable age, or their inability to match current levels of performance may be caused by contracting an illness. Whatever the cause, if the resulting condition is such that individuals cannot care for themselves, or may act in ways that are against their interests, those persons are vulnerable through dependency and require the protection of the state against the risks of abuse or exploitation. Hence, any agreements that were made are voidable, and a court may declare that person a ward of the state and grant power of attorney to an appointed legal guardian.

The UK&#x27;s Mental Capacity Act 2005 or MCA sets out a two-stage test of capacity:

# Is the person unable to make a particular decision? 
# Is the inability to make a decision caused by an impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, a person&#x27;s mind or brain?

The MCA states an individual is unable to make their own decision, if they are unable to do at least one of four things:

# Understand information given to them.
# Retain that information long enough to be able to make the decision.
# Weigh up the information available to make the decision.
# Communicate their decision.

In England and Wales, this is a specific function of the Court of Protection, and all matters concerning persons who have lost, or expect soon to lose, mental capacity are regulated under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. This makes provision for lasting powers of attorney under which decisions about the health, welfare, and financial assets of a person who has lost capacity may be dealt with in that person&#x27;s interests. In Ireland, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015. This Act addresses the capacity of people with intellectual disabilities. The general principles are set out in section 8 of the Act.

Under Singapore&#x27;s Mental Capacity Act 2008, &quot;a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time the person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain&quot;. Where an individual lacks capacity on grounds of mental illness or senility, a relative or other responsible person may obtain a lasting power of attorney to make decisions concerning the &quot;personal welfare&quot; of the person lacking capacity, the &quot;property and [financial] affairs&quot; of the person, or both. Questions as to whether an individual has the capacity to make decisions either generally or with regard to a particular matter or class of matters are generally resolved by a [[declaratory relief|judicial declaration] and the court making the declaration may appoint one or more individuals to act as deputies for the person lacking capacity.

This sort of problem sometimes arises when people suffer some form of medical problem such as unconsciousness, [[coma]], extensive [[paralysis]], or delirious states, from accidents or illnesses such as [[stroke]]s, or often when older people become afflicted with some form of medical/mental [[disability]] such as [[Huntington&#x27;s disease]], [[Alzheimer&#x27;s disease]], [[Lewy body]] disease, or similar dementia. Such persons are often unable to consent to medical treatment but otherwise handle their financial and other personal matters. If the afflicted person has prepared documents beforehand about what to do in such cases, often in a revocable living [[Trust law|trust]] or related documents, then the named legal guardian may be able to take over their financial and other affairs. If the afflicted person owns their property jointly with a spouse or other able person, the able person may be able to take over many of the routine financial affairs. Otherwise, it is often necessary to petition a court, such as a [[probate court]], that the afflicted person lacks legal capacity and allow a legal guardian to take over their financial and personal affairs. Procedures and court review have been established, dependent on the area of jurisdiction, to prevent exploitation of the incapacitated person by the guardian. The guardian periodically provides a financial accounting for court review.

In the [[Criminal Law]], the traditional common law [[M&#x27;Naghten Rules]] [[excuse]]d all persons from liability if they did not understand what they were doing or if they did, that they did not know it was wrong. The consequences of this excuse were that those accused were detained indefinitely or until the medical authorities certified that it was safe to release them back into the community. This consequence was felt to be too draconian, and so statutes have introduced new defenses that will limit or reduce the liability of those accused of committing offenses if they were suffering from a mental illness at the relevant time (see the [[insanity defense|insanity]] and [[mental disorder defense|mental disorder]] defenses).

====Intoxication====

Although individuals may have consumed a sufficient quantity of intoxicant or drug to reduce or eliminate their ability to understand exactly what they are doing, such conditions are self-induced and so the law does not generally allow any defense or excuse to be raised to any actions taken while incapacitated. The most generous states do permit individuals to repudiate agreements as soon as sober, but the conditions to exercising this right are strict.

==Business entities==
===General and limited partnerships===
There is a clear division between the approach of states to the definition of partnerships. One group of states treats [[general partnership|general]] and [[limited partnership|limited]] partnerships as aggregate. In terms of capacity, this means that they are no more than the sum of the natural persons who conduct the business. The other group of states allows partnerships to have a separate legal personality which changes the capacity of the &quot;firm&quot; and those who conduct its business and makes such partnerships more like corporations.
===Juridical persons===

====Corporations====
The extent of a [[juridical person]]&#x27;s capacity depends on the law of the place of incorporation and the enabling provisions included in the [[constitutional documents|constitutive documents]] of incorporation. The general rule is that anything not included in the corporation&#x27;s capacity, whether expressly or by implication, is &quot;[[ultra vires]]&quot;, i.e. &quot;beyond the power&quot; of the corporation, and so may be unenforceable by the corporation, but the rights and interests of innocent third parties dealing with the corporations are usually protected.

====Limited Liability Companies====
In American law, [[limited liability companies]] (LLCs) are legal persons. Some legal scholars have argued that they can be used to give [[Algorithmic entities|legal capacity to software programs]], including [[artificial intelligence]].

====Trade unions====
In some states, [[trade union]]s have limited capacity unless any contract made relates to union activities.
===Insolvent business entities===
When a business entity becomes [[Insolvency|insolvent]], an [[Administrator (law)|administrator]], receiver, or other similar legal functionary may be appointed to determine whether the entity shall continue to trade or be sold so that the creditors may receive all or a proportion of the money owing to them. During this time, the capacity of the entity is limited so that its liabilities are not increased unreasonably and to the detriment of the existing creditors.

<doc id="808986" wikidata="Q1924144" url="?curid=808986" title="Polytunnel">
<text>A polytunnel (also known as a polyhouse, hoop greenhouse or hoophouse, grow tunnel or high tunnel) is a tunnel typically made from steel and covered in polyethylene, usually semi-circular, square or elongated in shape. The interior heats up because incoming solar radiation from the sun warms plants, soil, and other things inside the building faster than heat can escape the structure. Air warmed by the heat from hot interior surfaces is retained in the building by the roof and wall. Temperature, humidity and ventilation can be controlled by equipment fixed in the polytunnel or by manual opening and closing of vents. Polytunnels are mainly used in temperate regions in similar ways to glass greenhouses and row covers. Besides the passive solar heating that every polytunnel provides, every variation of auxiliary heating (from hothouse heating through minimal heating to unheated houses) is represented in current practice. The nesting of row covers and low tunnels inside high tunnels is also common.

Polytunnels can be used to provide a higher temperature and/or humidity than that which is available in the environment but can also protect crops from intense heat, bright sunlight, winds, hailstones, and cold waves. This allows fruits and vegetables to be grown at times usually considered off season; market gardeners commonly use polytunnels for season extension. Beyond season extension, polytunnels are also used to allow cold-hardy crops to overwinter in regions where their hardiness is not quite strong enough for them to survive outdoors. Temperature increases of only above outdoor ambient, coupled with protection from the drying effect of wind, are enough to let selected plant varieties grow slowly but healthily instead of dying. The effect is to create a microclimate that simulates the temperatures of a location several hardiness zones closer to the equator (and protects from wind as well).

Every factor influencing a crop can be controlled in a polytunnel. Polytunnels are often used in floriculture and plant nurseries, as the revenue value of the plants can justify the expense.

In recent years the true adaptability of polytunnel structures has been realised by adapting them to suit livestock housing. It is now commonplace in the UK to see polytunnels used for housing sheep, alpacas, goats, calves and poultry.

== Climatic differences ==

===Temperate regions===
Polytunnels are mainly used in temperate regions in similar ways to greenhouses and cloches (row covers). Modern designs allow sowing and harvesting machines to move inside the structures so as to automate production. Polytunnels have had a significant effect on the production of strawberries in the United Kingdom. Other soft fruits such as raspberries and blackberries are also cultivated in the same way.
===Other regions===
In a tropical climate, temperatures are prone to soar above all normal levels. In such cases, foggers/misters are used to reduce the temperature. This does not increase the humidity levels in the poly house as the evaporated droplets are almost immediately ventilated to open air.

High-tech poly houses even have space-heating systems as well as soil-heating systems to purify the soil of unwanted viruses, bacteria, and other organisms. The recent Indo-Israel collaboration at Gharunda, near Karnal is an excellent example of Polyhouse farming taking place in a developing country.

If developing countries were to develop a special incentive program solely for fruit-and-vegetable farmers, especially in demographically large nations like India, then the migration rate from rural to urban areas (as well as the loss of horticultural and fruit/vegetable farmers) to urban areas may be reduced. This brings a huge potential to improve the farming sector, which is key to long-term economic stability. The small polytunnels used by each farmer in each village promote the cultivation of vegetables both on-season and off-season, and would actually help to moderate the market rate for fruit and vegetables in long run, on a year-round basis, and would help to satisfy local market needs.

For example, in India, the inability to grow tomatoes generates price spikes during the monsoon season. This is seen as an ideal time to grow tomatoes in polytunnels, since they provide the ideal climate for the crop. In India, the Abhinav Farmers Club grows flowers and organic vegetables in polytunnels.

==Development==
Hoophouses have existed at least since the 1940s, but they are much more commonly used with each passing decade, and their design continues to evolve. Because of the wide variety of constantly changing designs, in reality there is an entirely continuous spectrum from high tunnels through low tunnels to the simplest row covers, although they are often thought about as discrete steps. Major themes of continuing development are (1) achieving the same results with lighter construction and less cost and (2) making hoophouses easily movable. The advantages of mobile hoophouses include greater return on investment (with the same unit of investment getting greater use per year across different crops in different months) and more flexibility on crop rotation without ever having to bother to dig the soil out of a stationary house (or use soil steam sterilization) to cure greenhouse soil sickness.

A US Department of Agriculture program is helping farmers install polytunnels. The program was announced at the US White House garden in December 2009.

Farmers in Iraq are building these in increasing number and adding drip irrigation to grow tomatoes.

<text>Bosansko Grahovo () is a town and the seat of the Municipality of Bosansko Grahovo in Canton 10 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is situated in western Bosnia and Herzegovina along the border with Croatia. Prior to 1919, it was known as Arežin Brijeg.

== History ==

Until 1919, the settlement was called Arežin Brijeg. From 1929 to 1941, Bosansko Grahovo was part of the Vrbas Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, Bosansko Grahovo was a part of the Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). Administratively, it belonged to the Grand Parish of Krbava and Psat, established on 16 June 1941. The seat of the Parish was in Bihać. The Kotar of Bosansko Grahovo included the town of Bosansko Grahovo, Crni Lug, Drvar and Trubar. On 1 January 1942, the Kotar of Bosansko Grahovo was transferred to the Grand Parish of Bribir and Sidraga.

In the Drvar uprising Grahovo was captured by the Serb rebels commanded by Branko Bogunović. Bogunović joined the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland and in September 1941 he was appointed as commander of the &quot;Chetnik Regiment &quot;Gavrilo Princip&quot;&quot; from Grahovo. One hundred Croat civilians were murdered by the Chetniks during the Bosansko Grahovo massacre.

=== Bosnian War ===

During the Bosnian War, the town was held by Bosnian Serb forces. The Croatian Army captured the city in July 1995, during Operation Summer &#x27;95. The offensive displaced a large number of Serb refugees. After the war, the Serb civilians returned, and today they constitute the majority of the population in the municipality. However, nowadays the population is much smaller, having declined from 9,000 to about 2,500.

<doc id="809005" wikidata="Q183951" url="?curid=809005" title="Balloon (aeronautics)">
<text>In aeronautics, a balloon is an unpowered aerostat, which remains aloft or floats due to its buoyancy. A balloon may be free, moving with the wind, or tethered to a fixed point. It is distinct from an airship, which is a powered aerostat that can propel itself through the air in a controlled manner.

Many balloons have a basket, gondola, or capsule suspended beneath the main envelope for carrying people or equipment (including cameras and telescopes, and flight-control mechanisms).

==Aerostation==

Aerostation is an obsolete term referring to ballooning and the construction, operation, and navigation of lighter-than-air vehicles. Tiberius Cavallo&#x27;s &quot;The History and Practice of Aerostation&quot; was published in 1785. Other books were published on the subject including by Monck Mason. Dramatist Frederick Pilon wrote a play with aerostation as its title.

==Principles==
A balloon is conceptually the simplest of all flying machines. The balloon is a fabric envelope filled with a gas that is lighter than the surrounding atmosphere. As the entire balloon is less dense than its surroundings, it rises, taking along with it a basket, attached underneath, which carries passengers or payload. Although a balloon has no propulsion system, a degree of directional control is possible by making the balloon rise or sink in altitude to find favorable wind directions.

There are three main types of balloons:
*The hot air balloon or &quot;Montgolfière&quot; obtains its buoyancy by heating the air inside the balloon; it has become the most common type.
*The gas balloon or &quot;Charlière&quot; is inflated with a gas of lower molecular weight than the ambient atmosphere; most gas balloons operate with the internal pressure of the gas the same as the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere; a superpressure balloon can operate with the lifting gas at pressure that exceeds that of the surrounding air, with the objective of limiting or eliminating the loss of gas from day-time heating; gas balloons are filled with gases such as:
**hydrogen – originally used extensively but, since the Hindenburg disaster, is now seldom used due to its high flammability;
**coal gas – although giving around half the lift of hydrogen, extensively used during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, since it was cheaper than hydrogen and readily available;
**helium – used today for all airships and most manned gas balloons;
**other gases have included ammonia and methane, but these have poor lifting capacity and other safety defects and have never been widely used.
*The &quot;Rozière&quot; type has both heated and unheated lifting gases in separate gasbags. This type of balloon is sometimes used for long-distance record flights, such as the recent circumnavigations, but is not otherwise in use.

Both the hot air, or Montgolfière, balloon and the gas balloon are still in common use. Montgolfière balloons are relatively inexpensive, as they do not require high-grade materials for their envelopes, and they are popular for balloonist sport activity.

===Hot air balloons===


The first balloon which carried passengers used hot air to obtain buoyancy and was built by the brothers Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier in Annonay, France in 1783: the first passenger flight was 19 September 1783, carrying a sheep, a duck, and a rooster.

The first tethered manned balloon flight was by a larger Montgolfier balloon, probably on 15 October 1783. The first free balloon flight was by the same Montgolfier balloon on 21 November 1783.

When heated, air expands, so a given volume of space contains less air. This makes it lighter and, if its lifting power is greater than the weight of the balloon containing it, it will lift the balloon upwards. A hot air balloon can only stay up while it has fuel for its burner, to keep the air hot enough.

The Montgolfiers&#x27; early hot air balloons used a solid-fuel brazier which proved less practical than the hydrogen balloons that had followed almost immediately, and hot air ballooning soon died out.

In the 1950s, the convenience and low cost of bottled gas burners led to a revival of hot air ballooning for sport and leisure.

The height or altitude of a hot air balloon is controlled by turning the burner up or down as needed, unlike a gas balloon where ballast weights are often carried so that they can be dropped if the balloon gets too low, and in order to land some lifting gas must be vented through a valve.

===Gas balloons===

A man-carrying balloon using the light gas hydrogen for buoyancy was made by Professor Jacques Charles and flown less than a month after the Montgolfier flight, on 1 December 1783. Gas balloons have greater lift for a given volume, so they do not need to be so large, and they can also stay up for much longer than hot air, so gas balloons dominated ballooning for the next 200 years. In the 19th century, it was common to use manufactured town gas (coal gas) to fill balloons; this was not as light as pure hydrogen gas, having about half the lifting power, but it was much cheaper and readily available.
Light gas balloons are predominant in scientific applications, as they are capable of reaching much higher altitudes for much longer periods of time. They are generally filled with helium. Although hydrogen has more lifting power, it is explosive in an atmosphere rich in oxygen. With a few exceptions, scientific balloon missions are unmanned.

There are two types of light-gas balloons: zero-pressure and superpressure. Zero-pressure balloons are the traditional form of light-gas balloon. They are partially inflated with the light gas before launch, with the gas pressure the same both inside and outside the balloon. As the zero-pressure balloon rises, its gas expands to maintain the zero pressure difference, and the balloon&#x27;s envelope swells.

At night, the gas in a zero-pressure balloon cools and contracts, causing the balloon to sink. A zero-pressure balloon can only maintain altitude by releasing gas when it goes too high, where the expanding gas can threaten to rupture the envelope, or releasing ballast when it sinks too low. Loss of gas and ballast limits the endurance of zero-pressure balloons to a few days.

A superpressure balloon, in contrast, has a tough and inelastic envelope that is filled with light gas to pressure higher than that of the external atmosphere, and then sealed. The superpressure balloon cannot change size greatly, and so maintains a generally constant volume. The superpressure balloon maintains an altitude of constant density in the atmosphere, and can maintain flight until gas leakage gradually brings it down.

Superpressure balloons offer flight endurance of months, rather than days. In fact, in typical operation an Earth-based superpressure balloon mission is ended by a command from ground control to open the envelope, rather than by natural leakage of gas.

High-altitude balloons are used as high flying vessels to carry scientific instruments (like weather balloons), or reach near-space altitudes to take footage or photos of the earth. These balloons can fly over 100,000 feet (30.5 km) into the air, and are designed to burst at a set altitude where the parachute will deploy to safely carry the payload back to earth.

Cluster ballooning uses many smaller gas-filled balloons for flight.

===Combination balloons===
Early hot air balloons could not stay up for very long because they used a lot of fuel, while early hydrogen balloons were difficult to take higher or lower as desired because the aeronaut could only vent the gas or drop off ballast a limited number of times. Pilâtre de Rozier realised that for a long-distance flight such as crossing the English Channel, the aeronaut would need to make use of the differing wind directions at different altitudes. It would be essential therefore to have good control of altitude while still able to stay up for a long time. He developed a combination balloon having two gas bags, the Rozier balloon. The upper one held hydrogen and provided most of the steady lift. The lower one held hot air and could be quickly heated or cooled to provide the varying lift for good altitude control.

In 1785 Pilâtre de Rozier took off in an attempt to fly across the Channel, but shortly into the flight the hydrogen gas bag caught fire and de Rozier did not survive the ensuing accident. This earned de Rozier the title &quot;The First to Fly and the First to Die&quot;.

It wasn&#x27;t until the 1980s that technology was developed to allow safe operation of the Rozier type, for example by using non-flammable helium as the lifting gas, and several designs have successfully undertaken long-distance flights.

===Tethering and kite balloons===
As an alternative to free flight, a balloon may be tethered to allow reliable take off and landing at the same location. Some of the earliest balloon flights were tethered for safety, and since then balloons have been tethered for many purposes, including military observation and aerial barrage, meteorological and commercial uses.

The natural spherical shape of a balloon is unstable in high winds. Tethered balloons for use in windy conditions are often stabilised by aerodynamic shaping and connecting to the tether by a halter arrangement. These are called kite balloons.

A kite balloon is distinct from a kytoon, which obtains a portion of its lift aerodynamically.

==History==
===Antecedents===
Unmanned hot air balloons are mentioned in Chinese history. Zhuge Liang of the Shu Han kingdom, in the Three Kingdoms era (220–280 AD) used airborne lanterns for military signaling. These lanterns are known as Kongming lanterns ( ). The Mongolian army learned of the Kongming lantern from the Chinese and used it in Battle of Legnica during the Mongol invasion of Poland.
In 1709 the Brazilian-Portuguese cleric Bartolomeu de Gusmão made a balloon filled with heated air rise inside a room in Lisbon. On August 8, 1709, in Lisbon, Gusmão managed to lift a small balloon made of paper with hot air about four meters in front of king John V and the Portuguese court He also claimed to have built a balloon named &quot;&quot; (&quot;Big bird&quot;) and attempted to lift himself from Saint George Castle in Lisbon, landing about one kilometre away. However the claim of this feat remains uncertain, even though there is record of this flight in the source used by the FAI the exact distance and conditions of the flight are not confirmed.

===The first modern balloons===

Following Henry Cavendish&#x27;s 1766 work on hydrogen, Joseph Black proposed that a balloon filled with hydrogen would be able to rise in the air.

The first recorded manned flight was made in a hot air balloon built by the Montgolfier brothers on 21 November 1783. The flight started in Paris and reached a height of 500 feet or so. The pilots, Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d&#x27;Arlandes, covered about in 25 minutes.

On 1 December 1783, Professor Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers made the first gas balloon flight, also from Paris. Their hydrogen-filled balloon flew to almost 2,000 feet (600 m), stayed aloft for over 2 hours and covered a distance of 27 miles (43 km), landing in the small town of Nesles-la-Vallée.

The first Italian balloon ascent was made by Count Paolo Andreani and two other passengers in a balloon designed and constructed by the three Gerli brothers, on 25 February 1784. A public demonstration occurred in Brugherio a few days later, on 13 March 1784, when the vehicle flew to a height of 1,537 metres (5,043 ft) and a distance of 8 kilometres (5.0 mi). On 28 March Andreani received a standing ovation at La Scala, and later a medal from Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor.

De Rozier, together with Joseph Proust, took part in a further flight on 23 June 1784, in a modified version of the Montgolfiers&#x27; first balloon christened La Marie-Antoinette after the Queen. They took off in front of the King of France and King Gustav III of Sweden. The balloon flew north at an altitude of approximately 3,000 metres, above the clouds, travelling 52 km in 45 minutes before cold and turbulence forced them to descend past Luzarches, between Coye et Orry-la-Ville, near the Chantilly forest.

The first balloon ascent in Britain was made by James Tytler on 25 August 1784 at Edinburgh, Scotland, in a hot air balloon.

The first aircraft disaster occurred in May 1785 when the town of Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland was seriously damaged when the crash of a balloon resulted in a fire that burned down about 100 houses, making the town home to the world&#x27;s first aviation disaster. To this day, the town shield depicts a phoenix rising from the ashes.


Jean-Pierre Blanchard went on to make the first manned flight of a balloon in America on 9 January 1793, after touring Europe to set the record for the first balloon flight in countries including the Austrian Netherlands, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. His hydrogen filled balloon took off from a prison yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The flight reached 5,800 feet (1,770 m) and landed in Gloucester County, New Jersey. President George Washington was among the guests observing the takeoff. Sophie Blanchard, married to Jean-Pierre, was the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first woman to adopt ballooning as a career.

On 29 September 1804, Abraham Hopman became the first Dutchman to make a successful balloon flight in the Netherlands.

Gas balloons became the most common type from the 1790s until the 1960s. The French military observation balloon &quot;L&#x27;Intrépide&quot; of 1795 is the oldest preserved aircraft in Europe; it is on display in the &quot;Heeresgeschichtliches Museum&quot; in Vienna. Jules Verne wrote a short, non-fiction story, published in 1852, about being stranded aboard a hydrogen balloon.

The earliest successful balloon flight recorded in Australia was by William Dean in 1858. His balloon was gas-filled and travelled 30 km with two people aboard. On 5 January 1870, T. Gale, made an ascent from the Domain in Sydney. His balloon was 17 metres in length by 31 metres in circumference and his ascent, with him seated on the netting, took him about a mile before he landed in Glebe.

Henri Giffard also developed a tethered balloon for passengers in 1878 in the Tuileries Garden in Paris. The first tethered balloon in modern times was made in France at Chantilly Castle in 1994 by Aerophile SA.

Ballooning developed as a leisure activity. It was given a significant boost when Charles Green discovered that readily-available coal gas, then coming into urban use, gave half the lifting power of hydrogen, which had to be specially manufactured. In 1836 Green made an almost 500 mile long-distance flight from London, England to Weilberg in Germany.

===Military use===
The first military use of a balloon was at the Battle of Fleurus in 1794, when &quot;L&#x27;Entreprenant&quot; was used by the French Aerostatic Corps to watch the movements of the enemy. On 2 April 1794, an aeronauts corps was created in the French army; however, given the logistical problems linked with the production of hydrogen on the battlefield (it required constructing ovens and pouring water on white-hot iron), the corps was disbanded in 1799.

The first major use of balloons in the military occurred during the American Civil War with the Union Army Balloon Corps established in 1861.

During the Paraguayan War (1864–70), observation balloons were used by the Brazilian Army.

Balloons were used by the British Royal Engineers in 1885 for reconnaissance and observation purposes during the Bechuanaland Expedition and the Sudan Expedition. Although experiments in Britain had been conducted as early as 1863, a School of Ballooning was not established at Chatham, Medway, Kent until 1888. During the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902), use was made of observation balloons. A balloon was kept inflated for 22 days and marched 165 miles into the Transvaal with the British forces.

Hydrogen-filled balloons were widely used during World War I (1914–1918) to detect enemy troop movements and to direct artillery fire. Observers phoned their reports to officers on the ground who then relayed the information to those who needed it. Balloons were frequently targets of opposing aircraft. Planes assigned to attack enemy balloons were often equipped with incendiary bullets, for the purpose of igniting the hydrogen.

The Aeronaut Badge was established by the United States Army in World War I to denote service members who were qualified balloon pilots. Observation balloons were retained well after the Great War, being used in the Russo-Finnish Wars, the Winter War of 1939–40, and the Continuation War of 1941–45.

During World War II the Japanese launched thousands of hydrogen &quot;fire balloons&quot; against the United States and Canada. In Operation Outward the British used balloons to carry incendiaries to Nazi Germany. During 2018, incendiary balloons and kites were launched from Gaza at Israel, burning some 12,000 dunams (3,000 acres) in Israel.

Large helium balloons are used by the South Korean government and private activists advocating freedom in North Korea. They float hundreds of kilometers across the border carrying news from the outside world, illegal radios, foreign currency and gifts of personal hygiene supplies. A North Korean military official has described it as &quot;psychological warfare&quot; and threatened to attack South Korea if their release continued.

===Hot air returns===
Ed Yost redesigned the hot air balloon in the late 1950s using rip-stop nylon fabrics and high-powered propane burners to create the modern hot air balloon. His first flight of such a balloon, lasting 25 minutes and covering 3 miles (5 km), occurred on 22 October 1960 in Bruning, Nebraska. Yost&#x27;s improved design for hot air balloons triggered the modern sport balloon movement. Today, hot air balloons are much more common than gas balloons.

In the late 1970s the British hot air balloonist Julian Nott constructed a hot air balloon using technologies he believed would have been available to the Nazca culture of Peru some 1500 to 2000 years earlier, and demonstrated that it could fly. and again in 2003, Nott has speculated that the Nazca might have used it as a tool for designing the Nazca Lines. Nott also pioneered the use of hybrid energy, where solar power is a significant heat source, and in 1981 he crossed the English Channel.

==Modern ballooning==

In 2012, the Red Bull Stratos balloon took Felix Baumgartner to 128,100 ft. for a freefall jump from the stratosphere.

=== Sports ===

=== Commercial ===
Tethered gas balloons have been installed as amusement rides in Paris since 1999, in Berlin since 2000, in Disneyland Paris since 2005, in the San Diego Wild Animal Park since 2005, in Walt Disney World in Orlando since 2009, and the DHL Balloon in Singapore in 2006. Modern tethered gas balloons are made by Aerophile SAS.

Hot air balloons used in sport flying are sometimes made in special designs to advertise a company or product, such as the Chubb fire extinguisher illustrated.

===Astronautics===

====Balloon satellites====
A balloon in space uses internal gas pressure only to maintain its shape.

The Echo satellite was a balloon satellite launched into Earth orbit in 1960 and used for passive relay of radio communication. PAGEOS was launched in 1966 for worldwide satellite triangulation, allowing for greater precision in the calculation of different locations on the planet&#x27;s surface.

====Planetary probes====

In 1984, the Soviet space probes Vega 1 and Vega 2 released two balloons with scientific experiments in the atmosphere of Venus. They transmitted signals for two days to Earth.

==Ballooning records==
On 19 October 1910, Alan Hawley and Augustus Post landed in the wilderness of Quebec, Canada after traveling for 48 hours and 1887.6 kilometers (1,173 mi) from St. Louis during the Gordon Bennett International Balloon Race, setting a distance record that held for more than 20 years. It took the men a week to hike out of the woods, during which time search parties had been mobilized and many had taken the pair for dead.

On 13 December 1913 through 17 December 1913 Hugo Kaulen stayed aloft for 87 hours. His record lasted until 1976.

On 27 May 1931, Auguste Piccard and Paul Kipfer became the first to reach the stratosphere in a balloon.

On 31 August 1933, Alexander Dahl took the first picture of the Earth&#x27;s curvature in an open hydrogen gas balloon.

The helium-filled &quot;Explorer II&quot; balloon, piloted by US Army Air Corps officers Capt. Orvil A. Anderson, Maj. William E. Kepner and Capt. Albert W. Stevens, reached a new record height of 22,066 m (72,395 ft) on 11 November 1935. This followed the same crew&#x27;s previous near-fatal plunge in July 1934 in a predecessor craft, &quot;Explorer&quot;, after its canopy ruptured just 190 m (624 ft) short (it transpired) of the then-current altitude record of 22,000 m (72,178 ft) set by the Soviet balloon &quot;Osoaviakhim-1&quot;.

In 1976, Ed Yost set 13 aviation world&#x27;s records for distance traveled and amount of time aloft in his attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean —solo— by balloon (3.938 km, 107:37 h).

In 1978, Ben Abruzzo and his team became the first to cross the Pacific Ocean in a hot air balloon.

The current absolute altitude record for manned balloon flight was set at 34,668 m (113,739 ft) on 4 May 1961 by Malcolm Ross and Victor Prather in the Strato-Lab V balloon payload launched from the deck of the USS &quot;Antietam&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico.

The previous record altitude for a manned balloon was set at 38,960.5 m (127,823 ft) by Felix Baumgartner in the Red Bull Stratos balloon launched from Roswell, New Mexico on Sunday, 14 October 2012.

The current record altitude for a manned balloon was set at 41,419.0 m (135,889.108 ft) by Alan Eustace on 24 October 2014 as part of the StratEx Space Dive project.

On 1 March 1999 Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones set off in the balloon Breitling Orbiter 3 from Château d&#x27;Oex in Switzerland on the first non-stop balloon circumnavigation around the globe. They landed in Egypt after a 40,814 km (25,361 mi) flight lasting 19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes.
The altitude record for an unmanned balloon is 53.0 kilometres (173,882 ft) in the mesosphere, reached with a volume of 60,000 cubic metres. The balloon was launched by JAXA on 25 May 2002 from Iwate Prefecture, Japan. This is the greatest height ever obtained by an atmospheric vehicle. Only rockets, rocket planes, and ballistic projectiles have flown higher.

In 2015, the two pilots Leonid Tiukhtyaev and Troy Bradley arrived safely in Baja California, Mexico after a journey of 10,711 km. The two men, originally from Russia and the United States of America respectively, started in Japan and flew with a helium balloon over the Pacific. In 160 hours, the balloon named &quot;Two Eagles&quot; arrived in Mexico, which is new distance and duration records for straight gas balloons.

<text>Kim Fields Morgan ( Fields, formerly Freeman) is an American actress and director. She first gained fame as a child actress on the television series &quot;Good Times&quot; (1978–1979), and rose to greater prominence for her role as Dorothy &quot;Tootie&quot; Ramsey in the NBC sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1979–1981), as well as its spin-off &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (1979–1988).

Fields made her transition into mature roles as Regine Hunter on the Fox sitcom &quot;Living Single&quot; (1993–1998). Afterwards, she began work as a director on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;, as well as Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;House of Payne&quot;. She currently stars in the Netflix original series &quot;The Upshaws&quot; (2021–present).

==Career==
Before appearing on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, Fields co-starred in a short-lived sitcom called &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m Back&quot; with Demond Wilson and Denise Nicholas, and she appeared in a television commercial for Mrs. Butterworth&#x27;s syrup. She later appeared on two episodes of &quot;Good Times&quot; as a friend of Penny Gordon Woods, played by Janet Jackson. Fields&#x27; episodes on &quot;Good Times&quot; were &quot;The Snow Storm&quot; and &quot;The Physical&quot;.

Fields played the role of Dorothy &quot;Tootie&quot; Ramsey on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; from 1979 to 1988. Even years later, many still recognize her catchphrase, &quot;We&#x27;re in troouu-ble!&quot;. When the show began production, Fields was so short that the producers put her on roller skates during the first season so that they could avoid difficult camera angles. However, she later lost a role as Arnold Jackson&#x27;s girlfriend on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;″s parent show &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; because she was taller than Gary Coleman, who played Arnold. In 1984, during the run of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, Fields released two singles on the Critique Records label: the disco/Hi-NRG &quot;He Loves Me He Loves Me Not&quot; (which became a minor club hit), and &quot;Dear Michael&quot; (which became a minor R&amp;B hit, reaching No. 50).

After taking time away from acting to attend Pepperdine University, Fields appeared in a 1993 episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, in which Will Smith pretended to marry her in an attempt to seduce her. Fields had a starring role in the hit Fox sitcom &quot;Living Single&quot; as Regina &quot;Reginé&quot; Hunter from 1993 to 1998. In this role, Fields would act alongside her real-life mother Chip Fields, who played her character&#x27;s mother on the show.

Following the end of &quot;Living Single&quot;, Fields began performing R&amp;B and rap music with a group called Impromp 2. With her degree from Pepperdine University, Fields also began directing. Fields directed a number of episodes of the &quot;All That!&quot; spin-off &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;, in which she also appeared in two episodes. She has worked as a director on the sitcoms &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s Meet the Browns&quot;, &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot; and BET&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;.

Fields guest-starred on television shows such as UPN&#x27;s &quot;One on One&quot;, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, and &quot;Martin&quot;. She appeared as herself on HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Comeback&quot;. On February 1, 2007, Fields was reunited with her co-star Lisa Whelchel on WFAA-TV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Texas&quot;. Fields was in Dallas to promote her appearance in the production &quot;Issues: We&#x27;ve All Got &#x27;Em&quot; when Whelchel was introduced as a surprise guest. It marked the first time in six years (since &quot;The Facts of Life Reunion&quot; movie) that Fields and Whelchel had seen each other.

Fields has worked with her husband Christopher Morgan on projects. In 2010, she and Morgan produced and directed a Christmas television special called &quot;Holiday Love&quot;. They shot the entire show in three days. &quot;Holiday Love&quot; aired on TV One and a second episode aired for Christmas, 2011. In an interview that included background on the show, Fields described the special as &quot;restorative and transformative&quot; of her Christian faith. Fields revived &quot;Holiday Love&quot; on the Internet in 2013.

On August 18, 2015, it was announced that she would be joining the cast of the Bravo reality television show &quot;The Real Housewives of Atlanta&quot; for its eighth season. On March 21, 2016, she announced that she would not return to the show for another season. 

On March 8, 2016, Fields was announced as one of the celebrities who will compete on season 22 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was partnered with professional dancer Sasha Farber. On May 2, 2016, during a double elimination, Fields and Farber were eliminated and finished the competition in 8th place.

In 2017, Fields played the role of Theresa Newman in the Christian film &quot;A Question of Faith&quot;, which featured Fields&#x27; first co-starring appearance in a feature film and premiered in theaters on September 29, 2017.

Since May 2021, Fields has starred on Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Upshaws&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Fields was married to film producer Johnathon Franklin Freeman from 1995 to 2001. Fields gave birth to her first child, Sebastian Alexander Morgan, by then-boyfriend Broadway actor Christopher Morgan, on May 4, 2007. The couple introduced their son the following week in &quot;People&quot; magazine. On July 23, 2007, they were married in a private ceremony officiated by Pastor Donnie McClurkin. In July 2013, Fields announced on the talk show &quot;The Real&quot; that she and her husband were expecting another son; on December 3, 2013, they welcomed Quincy Xavier Morgan in Atlanta, Georgia.

<text>The Fly is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Red Circle Comics, an imprint of Archie Comics. He was created by Joe Simon as part of Archie&#x27;s &quot;Archie Adventure Series&quot; and later camped up (as Fly Man) as part of the company&#x27;s Mighty Comics line. He first appeared in &quot;The Double Life of Private Strong&quot; #1 (June 1959); however, his origin story and first &quot;full-length&quot; appearance were in &quot;Adventures of the Fly&quot; #1 (Aug. 1959).

== Concept and creation ==
According to Joe Simon, the character would not be inspired by a fly, but by a spider, the origin would be very similar, Tommy Troy would find a ring that would grant him spider powers. according to Simon, the character had provisional names Spiderman and Silver Spider. The character was reworked and became The Fly, Simon reused the Spider theme by creating his first villain: Spider Spry.

Some sources indicate that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man may have been inspired by this initial version of the hero.

== Publication history ==
After the first four issues of &quot;Adventures of the Fly&quot; (Simon and Kirby left the title after the fourth issue), others took on the character and made him an adult lawyer who fought crime in Capital City. He was later partnered with Fly Girl.

&quot;Adventures of The Fly&quot; was cancelled with issue #30 (Oct 1964). The Fly also appeared in short stories in some of Archie&#x27;s other titles (&quot;The Double Life of Private Strong&quot; #1 and #2 both published in 1959), (&quot;Pep Comics&quot; #151, 154, 160 and &quot;Laugh&quot; #128, 129, 132, 134, 137-139) between October 1961 and January 1963.

His own series was restarted as &quot;Fly Man&quot; as part of the &quot;Mighty Comics Group&quot;, which ran from issues #31-39 (May 1965 - Sept. 1966). The title changed again to &quot;Mighty Comics&quot;, which featured various Archie super-heroes in solo adventures for #40-50 before its cancellation in 1967.

&quot;The Fly&quot; was published again in the 1980s under the Red Circle Comics imprint, running from issue #1 (May 1983) to #9 (October 1984). The stories in this series were more similar to the previous stories in &quot;Adventures of The Fly&quot; and co-starred Fly Girl. With issue #5, Steve Ditko both wrote and drew the stories, which portrayed Tommy Troy being framed and discredited. Ditko left the series after issue #8, and another writer wrapped up the storyline in #9, which cleared Troy from any guilt.

The Fly was one of the characters used in DC Comics&#x27; revamp of the Archie characters in DC&#x27;s !mpact Comics line. This series, also called &quot;The Fly&quot;, ran 17 issues (Aug. 1991 - Dec. 1992) and portrayed the Fly as a boy (named Jason Troy) who turned into an adult superhero, similar to the original version of the character.

Archie Comics reprinted the first four issues of the 1959 series in a 2004 trade paperback collection under the company&#x27;s Red Circle imprint.

In 1999, Joe Simon regained the rights to the character thanks to copyright termination. The termination did not affect Fly-Girl, since she was created after Simon and Kirby left the title.

With the post Infinite Crisis reboot of the DC Comics continuity, and the subsequent licensing of the &quot;Red Circle&quot; comics characters and mark, a newly revamped version of the Mighty Crusaders were introduced and came to be called Fly Man. Since Archie Comics no longer owned the rights to the Fly, DC couldn&#x27;t use the character. Instead, they used Fly-Girl, his female counterpart in the original &#x27;60 stories.

Fly Girl has subsequently stood in for The Fly in Archie&#x27;s 2012 &quot;New Crusaders&quot; series.

In 2007, the French collective and publisher Organic Comix negotiated with Joe Simon for the publication of The Fly in the comic book &quot;Strange&quot;. Although he didn&#x27;t want to authorize it at first, Joe liked the artwork presented, new stories were created by Jim Simon (Joe Simon&#x27;s son), Jean Depelley and Reed Man. In this version, The Fly also uses the identity of the villain from his first stories: Spider Spry, reestablishing the connection between The Fly and Spider-Man. Joe&#x27;s son, Jim Simon, presents a new project, the hero ShieldMaster, created by Joe and Jim, working again with the same team. Shieldmaster is also published in the comic books &quot;Futura&quot; and &quot;Étranges Aventures&quot;. From 2015, when our stories relaunched our United States by Future Retro Entertainment, Jim and his son Jessie Simon published the ShieldMaster crowdfunded on Kickstarter.

==Fictional character biography==
Tommy Troy was an orphan hired by Ben (or Ezra) and Abigail March. Late one night, he tried wearing a ring with a fly-shaped emblem he found in their attic. The Marches were wizards, and the ring summoned Turan, one of the Fly People.

Turan explained that, ages ago, the Fly People ruled the Earth. They used magic in their wars, in the ultimate one of which they reduced most of their population to common houseflies. Only a few Fly People managed to escape to another dimension, where they waited for &quot;one person... pure of heart&quot; to fight crime and greed, which were their own downfall. Tommy was that person. By rubbing the ring and saying &quot;I wish I were the Fly,&quot; he exchanged bodies with the other dimension and became a costumed adult superhero. To return to his own identity, all he had to do was utter his name.

The Fly was dressed in a predominantly dark green leotard with yellow shorts and belt and a yellow over-the-head mask. A pair of goggle-like eye pieces covered his eyes and a set of &quot;wings&quot; were built into the collar area. Originally the wings were small decorations; when the character became capable of flight, the wings became larger and somehow fully functional.

The Fly was one of the few 60&#x27;s superheroes who carried a holstered weapon. The Buzz Gun, so named from the buzzing noise made when activated, was a handgun capable of dispensing non-lethal tranquillizer darts or stun rays, depending on setting.

===Powers and abilities===

During the start of the Archie Comics run of the character, the Fly possessed only four talents: the ability to walk up walls, to see in all directions, to escape from any trap, and acrobatic agility. Later in the series a string of insect powers were gradually added; in his final realization the Fly possessed whatever power the world&#x27;s insects possessed multiplied times an nth quantity. Prime examples were: strength of a million ants, flight as fast as a million flies, durability, the power to shatter materials by vibrating his &quot;wings&quot; in chirping cricket fashion, webbing spun from the small of his back, bio-luminescent light and &quot;heat&quot;, resistance to radiation and the ability to mentally control insects. Later in the series when actress Kim Brand was provided her own Fly Ring powers, becoming Fly-Girl, she possessed the same roster of magical insect-themed endowments.

Later both characters became capable of growing to skyscraper proportions or reducing to the size of an insect. These new powers were to remain during the rest of the Archie Series but were ignored during the Red Circle run.

==In other media==
A TV series based on the Fly was in development at one point.

<doc id="809041" wikidata="Q1473924" url="?curid=809041" title="Grand Turk Island">
<text>Grand Turk is an island in the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British Overseas Territory, tropical islands in the Lucayan Archipelago of the Atlantic Ocean and northern West Indies. It is the largest island in the Turks Islands (the smaller of the two archipelagos that make up the island territory) with . Grand Turk contains the territory&#x27;s capital, Cockburn Town, and the JAGS McCartney International Airport. The island is the administrative, historic, cultural and financial centre of the territory and has the second-largest population of the islands at approximately 4,831 people in 2012.

The name comes from a species of cactus on the island, the Turk&#x27;s cap cactus (&quot;Melocactus intortus&quot;), which has a distinctive cap, reminiscent of an Ottoman fez. In addition, this interpretation of the name received a reaction in the Turkish press on the grounds that it was anachronism. Fez began to be used by the Ottoman Turks in the 19th century, and the &quot;Turk&quot; in the island&#x27;s name dates back to very old times.

== History ==
The Lucayan people were the indigenous people of the island, who called it &quot;Abawana,&quot; meaning &quot;the First Small Land&quot;&quot;.&quot; The Spanish later called it Amuana.

Grand Turk was first colonised in 1681 by Bermudians, who set up the salt industry in the islands. In 1766 it became the capital of the country. For some time, at least until the early 19th century, Grand Turk was often referred to as Grand Cay, not to be confused with either Grand Cay in the Bahamas or Grand Cayman.

=== Grand Turk Lighthouse ===
Grand Turk Lighthouse was erected in 1852 near northern end of the island. The lighthouse was designed by Alexander Gordon and built by Chance Brothers in England. It was shipped in pieces and assembled on Grand Turk.
==Columbus landfall theory==
Grand Turk has been put forward as the possible landfall island of Christopher Columbus during his first voyage to the New World in 1492. San Salvador Island or Samana Cay in the Bahamas is traditionally identified with Guanahani, the site of Columbus&#x27; first landfall, but some believe that studies of Columbus&#x27; journals show that his descriptions of Guanahani much more closely fit Grand Turk than they do other candidates. Magnetic variations that caused misreadings in Columbus&#x27; compasses demonstrate that several of the recorded moorings using a rope-secured anchor to a clear sandy bottom would not have been possible had Columbus sailed from the islands of the Bahamas. In addition, the latitudes recorded in Columbus&#x27; diary place the landfall island at from Hispaniola, too close for the Bahamas, but almost exactly the distance from Grand Turk.

On the contrary, historian Gregory McIntosh has concluded that Grand Turk was not Guanahani but Babueca, an island separately discovered by Martín Alonso Pinzón in November - December 1492.

==U.S. Military presence==
===Naval Facility Grand Turk===
A U.S. Naval Facility (NAVFAC), the name given for a shore terminus of an offshore surveillance array of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS), was established on Grand Turk in 1954 as one of three additional Atlantic systems installed that year during the first phase of SOSUS installation. The facility was commissioned 23 October 1954 and was active until decommissioned 31 March 1980. The actual undersea surveillance mission of the system and shore facility remained classified through decommissioning. The NAVFAC was located () near the Grand Turk Lighthouse.

===Missile Impact Location System===
Grand Turk, located about from Cape Canaveral, became the first down range tracking facility of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Eastern Range to have a Missile Impact Location System (MILS) target array to detect the splash down location of test missile nose cones. The next target arrays down range were located at at Antigua and at at Ascension Island. In addition to the precise target array the facility was the terminus of one of the Broad Ocean Area (BOA) MILS that could give good location data over large ocean areas.

===Other installations and events===
From 1957 to 1959 USN Mobile Construction Battalion 7 constructed a LORAN Station on the island.

In 1962, John Glenn&#x27;s &quot;Friendship 7&quot; Mercury spacecraft landed in the vicinity of Grand Turk off the southeast shoreline. A replica of the &quot;Friendship 7&quot; is on display in Grand Turk at the entrance to the Grand Turk airport.

In 1966 at least five Arcas (All-Purpose Rocket for Collecting Atmospheric Soundings) sounding rockets were launched from Grand Turk by the USA.

<text>In economics, quantity adjustment is the process by which a market surplus leads to a cut-back in the quantity supplied or a market shortage causes an increase in supplied quantity. It is one possible result of supply and demand disequilibrium in a market. Quantity adjustment is complementary to pricing.

In the textbook story, favored by the followers of Léon Walras, if the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied in a market, &quot;price adjustment&quot; is the rule: if there is a market &quot;surplus&quot; or glut (excess supply), prices fall, ending the glut, while a &quot;shortage&quot; (excess demand) causes price to rise. A simple model for price adjustment is the &quot;Evans price adjustment model&quot;, which proposes the differential equation:

:formula_1

This says that the rate of change of the price (P) is proportional to the difference between the quantity demanded (QD) and the quantity supplied (QS).

However, instead of price adjustment — or, more likely, &quot;simultaneously&quot; with price adjustment — quantities may adjust: a market surplus leads to a cut-back in the quantity supplied, while a shortage causes a cut-back in the quantity demanded. The &quot;short side&quot; of the market dominates, with limited quantity demanded constraining supply in the first case and limited quantity supplied constraining demand in the second. 

Economist Alfred Marshall saw market adjustment in quantity-adjustment terms in the short run. During a given &quot;market day&quot;, the amount of goods on the market was &quot;given&quot; -- but it adjusts in the short run, a longer period: if the &quot;supply price&quot; (the price suppliers were willing to accept) was below the &quot;demand price&quot; (what purchasers were willing to pay), the quantity in the market would rise. If the supply price exceeded the demand price, on the other hand, the quantity on the market would fall. Marshallian quantity adjustment is described as follows:

:formula_2

This says that the rate of change of the quantity supplied is proportional to the difference between the demand price (DP) and the supply price (SP). 

Quantity adjustment contrasts with the tradition of Léon Walras and general equilibrium. For Walras, (ideal) markets operated &quot;as if&quot; there were an Auctioneer who called out prices and asked for quantities supplied and demanded. Prices were then varied (in a process called &quot;tatonnement&quot; or groping) until the market &quot;cleared&quot;, with each quantity demanded equal to the corresponding quantity supplied. In this pure theory, no actual trading was allowed until the market-clearing price was determined. In the Walrasian system, only price adjustment operated to equate the quantity supplied with the quantity demanded.

<doc id="809108" wikidata="Q3297747" url="?curid=809108" title="The Thin White Duke">
<text>The Thin White Duke was the persona and character adopted by the English musician David Bowie for public appearances in the mid-1970s. Though the Duke is primarily identified with Bowie&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Station to Station&quot; and is mentioned by name in the title track, he had first begun to adopt aspects of the persona during the tour supporting his &quot;Young Americans&quot; album in late 1974. The look and character of the Thin White Duke were also influenced by that of Thomas Jerome Newton, the humanoid alien played by Bowie in the film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, which filmed in mid-1975.

The Thin White Duke became a controversial figure due to ostensibly pro-fascist statements made by Bowie in press interviews during this period. Soon after making the comments, Bowie claimed that they were &quot;theatrical&quot; remarks made in character and did not reflect his actual views. In later years, he blamed his erratic behaviour during the mid-1970s on an &quot;astronomical&quot; use of hard drugs (particularly cocaine) while living in Los Angeles. He left California for Europe in late 1976 to improve his mental and physical well-being and settled in West Berlin in early 1977, at which point he quietly retired the Thin White Duke persona.

==Development==

David Bowie, who had experience performing in experimental theatre before becoming famous as a musician, began adopting different performing personae in the early 1970s, most notably the glam alien Ziggy Stardust. He famously retired Ziggy in 1973 at the end of the Ziggy Stardust Tour, and adopted the dystopian Halloween Jack persona for his &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; album and most of the following tour.

An early version of the Thin White Duke character began to appear in late 1974 during the second leg of the tour. During this &quot;plastic soul&quot; lead-up to his &quot;Young Americans&quot; album, Bowie&#x27;s hair was still orange, but it was cut shorter, and his stage costumes moderated from colorful glam outfits to more conventional dress clothes. The Thin White Duke was mentioned by name in the title track of Bowie&#x27;s next album, &quot;Station to Station&quot;, and he appeared in that persona during the following Isolar Tour.

Bowie was significantly influenced by William S. Burroughs, whom he met in 1973, enthusiastically incorporating his &#x27;cut-up&#x27; technique as a method to harness unconscious creative processes. Stark suggests that Burroughs&#x27; reference to semen in &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; as &#x27;the Thin White Rope&#x27; may have influenced the name of the Thin White Duke.

==Characteristics==
At first glance, the Thin White Duke appeared more conventional than Bowie&#x27;s previously flamboyant glam incarnations. Sporting well-groomed blonde hair and wearing a simple, cabaret-style wardrobe consisting of a white shirt, black trousers, and a waistcoat, the Duke was a hollow man who sang songs of romance with an agonised intensity while feeling nothing, &quot;dry ice masquerading as fire&quot;. The persona has been described as &quot;a mad aristocrat&quot;, &quot;an amoral zombie&quot;, and &quot;an emotionless &quot;Aryan&quot; superman&quot;. Bowie himself described the character as &quot;A very Aryan, fascist type; a would-be romantic with absolutely no emotion at all but who spouted a lot of neo-romance.&quot;

==Controversy==
The Thin White Duke was a controversial figure. While being interviewed in the persona in 1975 and 1976, Bowie made statements about Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany that some interpreted as being sympathetic to fascism or even pro-fascist. The controversy deepened in May 1976 when, while acknowledging a group of fans outside of London Victoria station, he was photographed making what some alleged to be a Nazi salute. Bowie denied this, saying that he was simply waving to fans and the photographer happened to take the photo while his arm was outstretched.

As early as 1976, Bowie began disavowing his allegedly pro-fascist comments and said that he was misunderstood. In an interview that year in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, he explained that while performing in his various characters, &quot;I&#x27;m Pierrot. I&#x27;m Everyman. What I&#x27;m doing is theatre, and only theatre ... What you see on stage isn&#x27;t sinister. It&#x27;s pure clown. I&#x27;m using myself as a canvas and trying to paint the truth of our time on it. The white face, the baggy pants they&#x27;re Pierrot, the eternal clown putting over the great sadness.&quot; In 1977 (after retiring the Duke), Bowie stated that &quot;I have made my two or three glib, theatrical observations on English society and the only thing I can now counter with is to state that I am &quot;not&quot; a fascist&quot;.

In later years, Bowie called the mid-1970s &quot;the darkest days of my life&quot; due to &quot;astronomical&quot; usage of cocaine and amphetamines. For much of 1975, he was obsessed with Satanic symbols, remained awake for days at a time, and lived on a diet of red peppers, milk, and hard drugs. In subsequent interviews, he blamed his erratic behavior and fascination with Nazi Germany and the occult during his Thin White Duke period on drug-induced paranoia and depression, and claimed that his mental state was such that he could not remember the late-1975 recording sessions for &quot;Station to Station&quot;. &quot;It was a dangerous period for me,&quot; he explained. &quot;I was at the end of my tether physically and emotionally and had serious doubts about my sanity.&quot; Eventually, he began to see the Thin White Duke as &quot;a nasty character indeed&quot;, and later, &quot;an ogre&quot;.

==Aftermath==
In an attempt to salvage his mental and physical health, Bowie left California&#x27;s drug-fueled social scene for Europe in late 1976, staying in Geneva, Switzerland, for a time before joining his friend Iggy Pop in West Berlin in early 1977. Though he did not publicly retire the Thin White Duke as he had Ziggy Stardust, Bowie did not appear in the persona after settling in Europe.

Bowie lived in West Berlin for almost two years, during which time he moved on both musically and personally with his &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; albums (&quot;Low&quot;, &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Lodger&quot;) in collaboration with Brian Eno and Tony Visconti. He also produced Pop&#x27;s albums &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot;.

<text>Tony Pedro Oliva Lopez (born Antonio Oliva Lopez Hernandes Javique; July 20, 1938) is a Cuban former professional baseball player and coach. He played his entire career in Major League Baseball as a right fielder and designated hitter for the Minnesota Twins from to . An eight-time All-Star player, Oliva was an integral member of the Twins teams that won the American League pennant and two consecutive American League Western Division titles in 1969 and 1970.

Oliva was named the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1964 and won three American League batting championships as well as a Gold Glove Award during his career. Playing in baseball&#x27;s &quot;second dead-ball era&quot;, he was one of the game&#x27;s best hitters during his first eight seasons. After eight seasons in the majors, Oliva&#x27;s career was hampered by a series of severe knee injuries, forcing him to become a designated hitter during his final four years in baseball. He retired with a career batting average of .304.

Oliva was inducted into the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame in 2000. The Twins retired Oliva&#x27;s uniform number 6 in 1991. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==

Born in Pinar del Río Province, Cuba in 1938, he played baseball weekly with his father, brothers, and neighbors in a vacant lot near the family farm. Oliva&#x27;s father, who worked in a tobacco factory and was famous for rolling the best cigars, was also a former semi-professional player who instructed Tony and helped him become &quot;the best hitter in Pinar del Río&quot;. A scout for the Minnesota Twins noticed the youth and brought him to the United States to play professionally. He was reluctant to leave his parents and nine siblings, but his father encouraged him to become &quot;rich and famous&quot; in America.

==Professional baseball career==
===Minor leagues===
Oliva arrived in the US in the spring of 1961. During spring training that year, he appeared in the Twins&#x27; final three games, collecting seven hits in ten at bats. The Twins, however, had already filled their minor league rosters and released Oliva, with some saying it was due to his poor outfield play. Having nowhere else to go, Oliva traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina to train with a friend who played for a Minnesota Twins Class A farm team. His quick wrists, long frame, and &quot;unharnessed power&quot; impressed Charlotte general manager Phil Howser, who placed a call and convinced the Twins to re-sign the potential star.

Due to a paperwork switch at Oliva&#x27;s arrival in the US to reflect the name and birthdate of his younger brother Pedro Jr. (born 1941) in order to appear younger to major league scouts, many newspapers reported the 21-year-old Tony as his 18-year-old sibling. The name stuck and Oliva officially changed his name to &quot;Tony Pedro Oliva&quot; in the late 1990s.

The Twins assigned Oliva to the class-D Wytheville Twins in the Appalachian League, where he played in 64 games and led the league with a .410 batting average, but had a low fielding percentage of .854. After finishing second to Orlando Cepeda in batting average in the Puerto Rico leagues in winter ball, Oliva was sent to single-A Charlotte in the South Atlantic League, where he played 127 games and hit .350 with 17 home runs and 93 RBIs. He was called up to the major leagues with nine games left and debuted for the Twins on September 9, 1962, hitting a searing .444 in 12 plate appearances.

In 1963, he was invited to spring training with the Twins and management hoped that the lefty Oliva would counterbalance their right-handed sluggers Bob Allison and Harmon Killebrew. While there, he became friends with teammate, and fellow Cuban, shortstop Zoilo Versalles, who quickly became convinced that Oliva was &quot;the new Ty Cobb&quot;, citing their similarities in hitting ability, speed, and arm strength. However, Oliva failed to make the Twins&#x27; major league team and was assigned to the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers, the club&#x27;s Class AAA affiliate in the Pacific Coast League. Disappointed, Oliva started the season slow, compiling a .235 average in his first two months. He recovered, however, and finished the minor league season with a .304 batting average with 23 home runs and 74 RBI. This earned him a call up for the final few games of the 1963 major league season. Once again he responded with a sizzling bat, hitting .429 in just 7 at-bats.

===Major leagues===

Oliva was selected as a near-unanimous 1964 American League (AL) Rookie of the Year, receiving 19 of 20 first-place votes. Oliva was voted to his first All-Star game in his rookie year, but went 0-for-4 at the plate. His AL-leading .323 batting average made him the first player ever to win both the Rookie of the Year Award and AL batting title. He also paced the AL in hits (217), doubles (43), extra base hits (84), total bases (374), runs (109), and runs created (133). Oliva&#x27;s 374 total bases tied a rookie record. Oliva finished fourth in MVP voting.

In 1965, Oliva won a second straight AL batting title with a .321 average, his back-to-back wins once again a baseball first. His performances were all the more noteworthy for falling right at the onset of baseball&#x27;s &quot;second deadball era&quot;, with only two other AL hitters reaching the .300 mark that season, (Carl Yastrzemski (.312) and Vic Davalillo (.301)). Oliva added 16 home runs, 98 runs batted in, and 107 runs. He led the AL in hits (185), runs created (108), sacrifice flies (10), and batting average (.321), good for a second-place finish in MVP voting to teammate and Twins spark plug Versalles. In his second All-Star game, Oliva entered as right fielder in the eighth inning, replacing game starter Rocky Colavito, and had a double in the ninth inning after pinch hitting in the seventh inning and grounding out.

Through the end of July in 1966, Oliva was leading the league with a .328 average. However, between August 21 and August 28 and September 13 and September 21, he slumped badly, collecting three hits in 29 at bats and four hits in 34 at bats respectively, which cost him a chance at his third straight batting title. Oliva finished with a .307 batting average and was the runner-up to Triple Crown winner and AL MVP Frank Robinson, who hit .316. For the third year in a row, Oliva led the AL in hits (191). Additionally, he won his only Gold Glove award, and finished sixth in MVP voting. One of the season&#x27;s highlights came on June 9, 1966, in the seventh inning of a game against the Kansas City Athletics, where Oliva joined Harmon Killebrew, Don Mincher, Rich Rollins and Versalles to hit five home runs in a single inning. These five home runs, hit off starter Catfish Hunter (three) and reliever Paul Lindblad (two), stand as of 2021, tying an MLB record for the most home runs in a single inning.

After a somewhat off 1967, where he led the AL with 37 doubles and finished in the top 10 in batting average, slugging percentage, hits, total bases, RBIs, runs created, extra base hits, and intentional walks, Oliva&#x27;s rebound in 1968 was cut short by injury. Missing the last 34 games, he once again hit .289, but so depressed were batting averages it was good for third in the AL by a single point (and only batting champ Yastrzemski topping .300 by a single point as well). He returned to form in 1969 to again place third in the AL with a .309 batting average, with 24 homers, 101 RBIs, and league leads in hits (197) and doubles (39). He finished third in batting average in the American League in 1970 at .325, with 23 home runs and 107 RBIs. He also led the AL in hits (204) for the fifth time, in doubles (36) for the fourth time, and finished second in MVP voting for the second time, this time to Baltimore&#x27;s Boog Powell.

In , Oliva won his third AL batting title with a .337 average and led the league in slugging percentage (.546). These feats at the end of a stretch of eight straight All-Star appearances that began his rookie season marked the high point of his career, as severe knee, leg, and shoulder injuries hampered his remaining playing days. His roommate Rod Carew often heard Oliva &quot;moaning and groaning&quot; and getting up to obtain ice for his sore knees during the night. He played just 10 games in 1972 before having season-ending surgery. Due to injuries and a 1973 American League rule change establishing a new position, he became the Twins&#x27; designated hitter that spring and remained in that role his final four seasons. Oliva would hit the first home run by a DH in league play on April 6, 1973. Just three months later, on July 3, 1973, Oliva also became the first DH to hit 3 home runs in a game against the Kansas City Royals in a 7-6 loss at Royals Stadium.

Oliva was a coach for the Twins after he retired as a player. As such, he holds the distinction of being the only on-field team member to appear with all three Minnesota Twins&#x27; World Series teams: star outfielder in 1965, hitting coach in 1987 and bench coach in 1991.

==Hall of Fame candidacy==

Oliva was considered for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame via voting of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BWAA) from 1982 to 1996.

Writer Bill James, utilizing the Keltner list, determined that Oliva was a &quot;viable Hall of Fame candidate&quot;, but ultimately did not endorse him as a Hall of Famer. Several contemporaries have endorsed Oliva&#x27;s enshrinement in the Hall of Fame, including Tony Pérez, who mentioned in his 2000 induction speech that he hoped Oliva would soon be in the Hall of Fame.

In 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007, Oliva was considered for the National Baseball Hall of Fame by its Veterans Committee&#x27;s election, but was unsuccessful. He was considered again by the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Golden Era Committee (from the 1947–1972 era) which voted in 2011, but was short by four of the required 12 votes needed for induction in 2012. In 2014, the Golden Era Committee considered him for the second time from their 10-candidate ballot, but both he and former infielder/outfielder Dick Allen were one vote short of election; one candidate was elected in 2011 and no one in 2014.

===Golden Days Committee===
The Golden Era Committee was replaced in July 2016 by a 16-member Golden Days Committee, to vote from a 10 candidate ballot for the 1950–1969 era. Oliva was voted into the Hall of Fame at their meeting on December 5, 2021, and was formally enshrined on July 24, 2022.

==Legacy==

Throughout his 15-year career, Oliva possessed a &quot;rather pleasant disposition&quot; and was known as a positive influence in a team&#x27;s clubhouse. He was popular with the fans and the media of the Twin Cities during his career, and was given the nickname &quot;Tony-O&quot;.

Oliva had strong offensive numbers during an era heavily dominated by pitching. He batted .304 with 220 home runs, 947 RBI, 870 runs, 1,917 hits, 329 doubles, 48 triples, 448 bases on balls and 86 stolen bases in 1,676 games played. In 13 postseason games, he batted .314 with 3 home runs and 5 RBI. He was selected to the All-Star team his first eight seasons, surpassing Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s previous record of six selections. In addition, he was a powerful-armed Gold Glove outfielder who led AL right fielders in putouts 6 times, double plays 3 times, and assists twice.

As a pinch hitter in his major league career, Oliva was very effective in that role. He batted .340 (32-for-94) with 2 home runs and 27 RBI.

In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. They explained what they called &quot;the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome&quot;, in which a player of truly exceptional talent but whose career was curtailed by injury, in spite of not having had career statistics that would quantitatively rank him with the all-time greats, should still be included on their list of the 100 greatest players.

In 1991, Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter named Oliva the toughest hitter he ever had to face because &quot;he could hit any pitch anywhere... he didn&#x27;t have any weaknesses.&quot; In 2006, Cy Young Award winner Dean Chance said that Oliva and Carl Yastrzemski were the two toughest hitters he had to face in his career. In 2021, three-time All-Star Luis Tiant wrote that Oliva was the toughest hitter he had to face in his career.

==Personal life==
Oliva started dating Gordette (DuBois) in the mid-1960s. They were married in Hitchcock, South Dakota in 1968 and settled in Bloomington, Minnesota. He currently lives in a house he bought in 1972 and all of his four children live within of their parents. As of 2015, Oliva also had four grandchildren.

<doc id="809132" wikidata="Q4859098" url="?curid=809132" title="Barbara Lett-Simmons">
<text>Barbara Lett-Simmons (née Lett; June 4, 1927 – December 22, 2012) was an American politician and educator in Washington, D.C. A member of the district&#x27;s Board of Education from 1974 to 1986, she was active in the Democratic Party. In 2000, she served as a presidential elector for Washington, D.C. in that year&#x27;s presidential election, and notably became a faithless elector when she cast a blank ballot as a protest against the district&#x27;s lack of voting representation in Congress.

==Early life==
Barbara Lett was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1927. She was an alumna of Western Michigan University which she graduated from in 1949. Shetaught elementary school in Detroit before moving to Washington in 1962, then worked as an elementary school teacher in Montgomery County, Maryland, until 1965. She worked as an educational coordinator for the United Planning Organization, a community services and empowerment organization and for a District of Columbia poverty program. She was also the host of a local radio talk show and a cable television program.

Lett-Simmons was a consultant helping to lead the search that led to the appointment of Barbara D. Sizemore as District of Columbia superintendent of schools in 1973. She was elected to the District of Columbia board of education in 1973, in which she served from 1974 to 1986.

==Board of Education==
On April to October 1978, Lett-Simmons was the subject of a drama of operatic proportions, when the school board meetings were held to look at the future of superintendent Barbara A. Sizemore, who was appointed in 1973. She was a defender of Sizemore. The superintendent, Sizemore was fired and was replaced by Vincent E. Reed. Lett-Simmons wrote a letter to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in which she complained about a travesty of justice and questioned whether the newspaper’s editorial board opposed Sizemore because she was black and female.

In 1977, she said, &quot;For years people wanted to suggest politics was a nasty word&quot;. Her opinion said, &quot;the schools are the most significant institution in society, and necessarily education must be politicized&quot;.

In 1978, Lett-Simmons helped to launch a piano competition for District of Columbia public school students.

In 1982, she criticized a plan for a closing school, saying it favored schools in predominately white sections of the city. Lett-Simmons often clashed with school superintendents and other board members.

Lett-Simmons was defeated for re-election in the District of Columbia board of education in 1985.

She was part of a vanguard of public officials who sought to leave their mark on the city. Lett-Simmons aims were to broaden opportunities for inner city children, expand vocational training and make the schools more accountable to residents.

==Political career ==
She was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention starting from the 1970s until her death in 2012. She ran unsuccessfully for the Council of the District of Columbia in 1982 and 1984. Lett-Simmons helped lead a 2004 petition effort to recall D.C. mayor Anthony A. Williams. In 1990, she failed a bid to become District of Columbia&#x27;s nonvoting delegate in Congress which she lost to Eleanor Holmes Norton.

=== Faithless elector ===
A Democratic elector from the District of Columbia in the 2000 United States presidential election, she cast a blank ballot in the Electoral College rather than vote for Al Gore for president and Joe Lieberman for vice president as was expected, in protest of the District of Columbia&#x27;s lack of a voting representative in Congress.

Lett-Simmons&#x27;s Electoral College abstention, the first since 1864, was intended to protest what Lett-Simmons referred to as the federal district&#x27;s &quot;colonial status&quot;.

Lett-Simmons described her blank ballot as an act of civil disobedience, not an act of a faithless elector; Lett-Simmons supported Gore and said she would have voted for him if she had thought he had a chance to win.

==Family==
She was the widow of Samuel J. Simmons, who died in 2003, former Assistant Secretary for the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. She was married to Samuel J. Simmons for 53 years. Both of her sons, David C. Simmons, the chief administration law judge of the District of Columbia Commission on Human Rights and Robert A. Simmons, both work in Washington, D. C. She had a brother and granddaughter.

==Death==
Lett-Simmons died on December 22, 2012, at age 85 in Washington Hospital Center. Her son, David C. Simmons said she had a heart ailment.

On January 3, 2013, hundreds gathered at Shiloh Baptist Church to pay tribute to Lett-Simmons. Mayor of the District of Columbia, Vincent C. Gray urged people in the gathering to follow Lett-Simmons example, stating, &quot;If you want to celebrate Barbara’s legacy, do it by standing up and fighting until we get statehood.&quot;

<text>Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology is a publicly funded English-language college located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The college has three campuses, all in Ontario: a primary campus located in Ottawa, and secondary campuses located in Perth and Pembroke. It offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, diplomas, and certificates in a range of disciplines and specialties. The college serves the National Capital Region and the outlying areas of Eastern Ontario, Western Quebec, and Upstate New York. It has been ranked among the Top 50 Research Colleges in Canada and has been recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s top innovation leaders. The enabling legislation is the &quot;Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act.&quot; It is a member of Polytechnics Canada.

==History==
The college was established during the formation of Ontario&#x27;s college system in 1967. Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965, when the Ontario system of public colleges was created. The founding institutions were the Eastern Ontario Institute of Technology (established in 1957) and the Ontario Vocational Centre Ottawa (established in 1965 at the Woodroffe Campus and known as OVC). The original site on Woodroffe Avenue was donated to the city by Mr and Mrs Frank Ryan.

The Ottawa architecture firm of Burgess, McLean &amp; MacPhadyen designed the midcentury academic complex with open-ended blocks alternatively faced with long glass expanses in a semi-gambrel formation that make up the curtain walls and precast aggregate panels. The corporate campus or modernist academic acropolis spread across North America in the early 1960s. The entrance is via a deeply recessed terrace that&#x27;s overhung with small white ceramic tiles and vintage can lights. The long walls are bumped out to float over the foundation. The foundation plantings keep the blocks from appearing stark.

The first Principal of the Ontario Vocational Centre (OVC) was Kenneth G. Shoultz. Principal Shoultz took on the leadership of OVC in 1965 after working as a technical studies teacher and then as an inspector for the Ontario Department of Education. K.G. Shoultz continued on as the first Dean of the Technical Centre after OVC was amalgamated with Algonquin College in 1967.

Algonquin College is named after the Algonquin First Nations Peoples who were the original inhabitants of the area.

In 1964, the Rideau Campus was established. &quot;Satellite&quot; campuses in Pembroke, Hawkesbury, Perth, Carleton Place and Renfrew were established in the late 1960s. The Vanier School of Nursing became a part of the Woodroffe Campus when nursing programs began to be offered at the college. In 1973, the School of Prescott-Russell joined the Algonquin family and the Colonel By Campus was created through the acquisition of St. Patrick&#x27;s College. With the creation of La Cité Collégiale, 1990 marked the beginning of Algonquin as an English college. The Hawkesbury campus was transferred to La Cité Collégiale, and the Renfrew, Colonel By, and Carleton Place campuses were progressively closed. The latest closure was in August 2002, when the Rideau Campus closed and its programs were moved to the Advanced Technology Centre on the Woodroffe Campus.

Expanding its academic purview, the college offers a variety of degree programs taught by expert faculty with a wide range of academic and technical experience. This includes Bachelor of Interior Design (Honours), Bachelor of Public Safety (Honours), Bachelor of Early Learning and Community Development (Honours), Bachelor of Commerce (E-Supply Chain Management), and several others.

==Woodroffe and Pembroke Campus Expansion==

===The DARE District and AC Library===

In 2016, Algonquin College launched a $44.9-million building renovation project set to be complete by spring/summer of 2018. This renovation is taking place in the college&#x27;s original &#x27;C&#x27; building which houses most of the administration.

The purpose of this significant renovation is to improve the campus library and to provide a range of collaborative spaces for students, staff, and faculty to grow and learn. The new building has been called the DARE District with DARE standing for Discovery, Applied Research, and Entrepreneurship. The DARE District also holds the new Institute for Indigenous Entrepreneurship, which provides Indigenous Algonquin College students and alumni a collaborative space to access resources they need in order to develop or create businesses. This renovation has contributed to the environmental sustainability of the college&#x27;s research and innovation infrastructure by transforming the northern wing of C building to a high-performance green building.
===ACCE and Robert C. Gillett Student Commons===

Opened in the fall of 2011, the Algonquin Centre for Construction Excellence, designed by Edward J. Cuhaci &amp; Associates Architects in joint venture with Diamond Schmitt Architects, houses 600 additional construction seats and provide space for thousands more students studying in related programs. The uniquely green, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certified building showcases a teaching laboratory for best practices in sustainable construction. The new facility integrates the relocated bus station and a new below-grade transit roadway (yet to be completed) to the main campus via a $4 million pedestrian bridge constructed across Woodroffe Avenue.

Opened in the fall of 2012, the Student Commons project is the result of a continued partnership between the College and its Students&#x27; Association. Unique to most Ontario colleges, the Algonquin College Students&#x27; Association operates many College services, ranging from the varsity athletics to the Algonquin Fitness Zone. Committed to securing additional social and study space for students, the SA Board of Directors, through consultation with its members, approved to designate part of its activity fee to secure $30 million to fund the new Student Commons. Recognizing this opportunity to improve and centralize student support services the College&#x27;s Board of Governors approved the contribution of an additional $22 million in funding for the project.

Algonquin College Mobile Learning Centre is a computer lab, designed by Edward J. Cuhaci &amp; Associates Architects, that delivers a collaborative learning environment using mobile and cloud computing technology.

===Algonquin College Waterfront Pembroke Campus===

Opened in fall 2012, the expansion of the Pembroke Campus adds more than 300 full-time student spaces. These spaces are housed in a modernist building located on the Ottawa River in Pembroke, Ontario. The new waterfront campus is seen as a new beginning for the College, the City of Pembroke, and all of Renfrew County. A new facility would allow the College to grow, allowing it to better meet the labour market needs of Renfrew County&#x27;s employers well into the future.

The college has one fully functional, broadcast radio station run entirely by the students of the Broadcasting-Radio program: CKDJ-FM, as well as an internet station: AIR - Algonquin, that is also broadcast as AIR AM 1700 via AM band.

The Algonquin College Animation Program is a three-year advanced diploma with its main focus on performance-based animation whether it be in 3D or traditional animation. Also, all students learn Toonboom&#x27;s Harmony software. The program is celebrating its 20-year anniversary in 2009-10 and has its curriculum being taught in India, China and South Africa with negotiations with Dubai, Chile and others. The faculty of the program are veterans of the animation industry, all of whom have been at least departmental supervisors, many with over 20 years experience in the industry. Since the introduction of the three-year curriculum, graduates of the program have gone on to varied and rewarding jobs in the animation industry with over 93% of grads finding work in their chosen field, including a graduate Trent Correy who has worked on three Oscar-winning motion-pictures including Zootopia, as well as working on Moana. Student films have gone on to be screened in various festivals, featured on AWN TV (&quot;Charged&quot;) and won the prestigious ELAN award for best student film 2009 (&quot;Snared&quot;).

The Algonquin College Public Relations program is a two-year diploma in which students have raised notable amounts of money for local not-for-profit organizations including the John Howard Society, LiveWorkPlay, and Harmony House Women&#x27;s Shelter. Since 1990, the Public Relations program has raised over $300,000 for charity.

The Pembroke Campus is well known for its outdoor training programs which attract students from across Canada. These programs include Outdoor Adventure, Outdoor Adventure Naturalist and Forestry Technician. In 2012, a new Waterfront Campus opened in downtown Pembroke.

==International Campuses==
Algonquin College has four international campuses through their international offshore partnerships:

* Manav Rachna International University (MRIU) – Faridabad, India
* Algonquin College (Orient Education Services Co) – Al-Naseem, Jahra, Kuwait
* Hotelski Educativni Centar (HEC) in Montenegro
* (JMI) in Nanjing, China

==Residence==
In August 2003, the Woodroffe Campus Residence Complex opened, providing housing for 1,050 students. There is also an abundance of off-campus housing in the area. Most students commute from throughout the National Capital Region by Ottawa&#x27;s city transit, OC Transpo or by car. Full-time students have a transit pass included in their tuition fees to facilitate off-campus living and reduce the demand for parking on campus.

The school&#x27;s residence is located just a short walk away from Baseline Station where students can take OC Transpo Route 75 or 74 to take them to Tunny&#x27;s Pasture station. From there, they can access the O-Train to gain access to the downtown core. There is also a clustering of apartment buildings and rental townhouses near the College called Deerfield where many second year students live.

The Pembroke Campus has a housing registry.

==Partnerships==

Algonquin has formed strategic partnerships with select universities to offer collaborative degrees. This includes the Bachelor of Information Technology - Interactive Multimedia and Design with Carleton University; Bachelor of Information Technology - Network Technology with Carleton University and Bachelor of Science in Nursing with the University of Ottawa. Studies take place at Algonquin College and the partnering university and collaborative degrees are conferred by the university. Algonquin has developed articulation agreements with universities to assist qualified Algonquin graduates to attain specific degrees in shorter periods. Graduates are subject to the admission requirements of the university granting the degree.

On February 16, 2017, Algonquin College announced a new partnership with The Ottawa Hospital in health research, innovation and training. The partnership, signed by Algonquin College President Cheryl Jensen and Executive Vice-President of Research at The Ottawa Hospital will be focused on digital health, clinical trials and biotherapeutics manufacturing. The partnership will stand for five years until requiring renewal.

Algonquin College has a partnership with Shopify, specifically Shopify U, which has added the study of graphic design to its course list. The partnership will allow students to attend classes at the downtown Ottawa Shopify office and then practice their newly learned skills by helping local businesses.

Internationally, the college has several partnerships with institutions in other countries to transfer expertise through technical assistance and training programs.

===Scholarships===
Algonquin College joined Project Hero, a scholarship program co founded by General (Ret&#x27;d) Rick Hillier for the families of fallen Canadian Forces members.

The Government of Canada sponsors an Indigenous Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation. Algonquin College bursaries for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: Peter Wintonick Bursary; Ottawa Police Service&#x27;s Thomas G. Flanagan Scholarship; MKI Travel and Hospitality Bursary.

===Military===
The Diploma in Military Arts and Sciences (DMASc) provides Non-Commissioned Members (NCMs) of the Canadian Forces an online program made possible by a partnership between OntarioLearn (Algonquin College consortium member), the RMC, and the Canadian Defence Academy. Under a RMC and Algonquin College articulation agreement, all graduates of this diploma program who apply to the RMC will be admitted into the Bachelor of Military Arts and Sciences degree program with advanced standing.

In 2006, Algonquin College was approached by the Canadian Forces Support Training Group (CFSTG) to explore the feasibility of developing and delivering a program to satisfy the training requirements exclusively for Canadian Forces Geomatics Technicians. The goal was to increase the number of CF graduates produced by the School of Military Mapping. Students in the Geomatics Technician program earn a college-approved certificate in Geomatics. Algonquin College also grants a provincially approved Geomatics Technician Diploma to students who successfully graduate from the Geomatics Technician Training and have completed a small number of approved additional courses.

==Sports==
The name of Algonquin College&#x27;s sports team is the Algonquin Wolves. Thor is the Algonquin College mascot. Algonquin is a member of the OCAA and the CCAA.

== &quot;Glue Magazine&quot; ==
Created and distributed for the first time in 2003, &quot;Glue Magazine&quot; has two deployments, with distribution being carried out twice a year- in September and in January. The issues and topics covered in the publication cover common student concerns such as money, food, friends, gaming, and more. The magazine is created via a collaborative effort between Algonquin College&#x27;s Journalism and Advertising Marketing Communications students to further their skills in editing, managing promotional material and advertisements. &quot;Glue magazine&quot; is circulated at three main Ottawa post-secondary campuses including Algonquin College, Carleton University, and the University of Ottawa.

== Services Available to the Public ==

<text>Johann Mattheson (28 September 1681 – 17 April 1764) was a German composer, critic, lexicographer and music theorist. His writings on the late Baroque and early Classical period were highly influential, specifically, &quot;his biographical and theoretical works were widely disseminated and served as the source for all subsequent lexicographers and historians&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Johann Mattheson was born on 28 September 1681 in Hamburg. The son of a prosperous tax collector, Mattheson received a broad liberal education and, aside from general musical training, took lessons in keyboard instruments, violin, composition and singing. By age nine he was singing and playing organ in church and was a member of the chorus of the Hamburg opera. He made his solo debut with the Hamburg opera in 1696 in female roles and, after his voice changed, sang tenor at the opera, conducted rehearsals and composed operas himself. He was cantor at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Hamburg from 1718 until increasing deafness led to his retirement from that post in 1728.

Mattheson&#x27;s chief occupation from 1706 was as a professional diplomat. He had studied English in school and spoke it fluently. He became tutor to the son of the English ambassador Sir John Wich and then secretary to the ambassador. He went on diplomatic missions abroad representing the ambassador. In 1709 he married Catharina Jennings, the daughter of an English clergyman; they did not have any children.

== Friendship with Handel ==
Mattheson was a close friend of George Frideric Handel, although he nearly killed Handel in a sudden quarrel during a performance of Mattheson&#x27;s opera &quot;Die unglückselige Kleopatra, Königin von Ägypten&quot; in 1704. Handel was saved only by a large button which turned aside Mattheson&#x27;s sword. The two were afterwards reconciled and remained in correspondence for life: shortly after his friend&#x27;s death, Mattheson translated John Mainwaring&#x27;s biography of Handel into German and had it published in Hamburg at his own expense (&quot;auf Kosten des Übersetzers&quot;) in 1761.

==Death==
After his death in 1764, Johann Mattheson was buried in the vault of Hamburg&#x27;s St. Michaelis&#x27; Church where his grave can be visited.

== Literary and musical legacy ==

Mattheson is mainly famous as a music theorist. He was the most abundant writer on performance practice, theatrical style, and harmony of the German Baroque. He is particularly important for his work on the relationship of the disciplines of rhetoric and music, for example in &quot;Das neu-eröffnete Orchestre&quot;, Hamburg 1713, and &#x27;, Hamburg 1739. However his books raise more and more attention and suspicion because Mattheson was a brilliant polemicist and his theories on music are often full of pedantry and pseudo-erudition.

The bulk of his compositional output was vocal, including eight operas, and numerous oratorios and cantatas. He also wrote a few sonatas and some keyboard music, including pieces meant for keyboard instruction. All of his music, except for one opera, one oratorio, and a few collections of instrumental music, went missing after World War II, but was given back to Hamburg from Yerevan, Armenia, in 1998. This includes four operas and most of the oratorios. The manuscripts are now located at the .

<doc id="809195" wikidata="Q5288184" url="?curid=809195" title="Dog Eat Dog (AC/DC song)">

<doc id="809197" wikidata="Q622329" url="?curid=809197" title="FYI (American TV channel)">
<text>FYI (stylized as fyi,) is an American basic cable channel owned by A&amp;E Networks, a joint venture between the Disney Entertainment subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company and Hearst Communications (each owns 50%). The network features lifestyle programming, with a mix of reality, culinary, home renovation and makeover series.

The network originally launched in 1998 as The Biography Channel, as an offshoot of A&amp;E and named after its television series &quot;Biography&quot;. As such, it originally featured factual programs, such as reruns of its namesake. As A&amp;E shifted its focus towards reality television and drama series, the Biography Channel became the home for several series that had been displaced by the flagship network (including &quot;Biography&quot; itself), but shifted towards reality-oriented series itself in 2007 and was rebranded as simply Bio. In 2014, the channel was rebranded as FYI, an initialism for &quot;for your information&quot;.

, FYI is available to approximately 35,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2015 peak of 73,000,000 households.

In recent years, FYI has lost carriage with the growth of streaming alternatives and has generally been depreciated by A&amp;E Networks in current retransmission consent negotiations with cable and streaming providers.

==History==
===The Biography Channel===

The channel was launched on November 16, 1998, as The Biography Channel by A&amp;E Television Networks, which conceived the channel as an offshoot of the long-running A&amp;E profile series &quot;Biography&quot;. On October 1, 2000, A&amp;E Networks expanded its British partnership with British Sky Broadcasting with the launch of a UK market Biography Channel.

In August 2006, The Biography Channel became the exclusive home for the &quot;Biography&quot; series, as it was dropped by A&amp;E. Another 64 hours of the show was ordered for its first year on the channel. In 2007, Biography Channel unveiled a new on-air brand—identifying the network simply as &quot;Bio&quot;. The changes came as the network shifted its scope to de-emphasize traditional biographical programs in favor of &quot;true stories about fascinating people&quot;, such as the series &quot;Shatner&#x27;s Raw Nerve&quot;, hosted by William Shatner.

Bio had been stagnating since A+E&#x27;s 2013 upfront presentation as little focus was placed upon it. Bio was generating 12 cents per subscriber from the video provider, about half the industry average. After tweaking the three main A+E channels, Bio averaged viewers of 91,000 adults 25–54 in prime compared to what A&amp;E (716,000) and History (703,000) managed over the same period. Jana Bennett was hired as president of LMN and Bio in June 2013 and, having transformed TLC from an educational channel to a lifestyle network, was considered an indication that adding a lifestyle channel to the A+E portfolio was a possibility. An opening in the genre occurred as the Style Network became the men-focused Esquire Network. While preparing to launch FYI, Bio began re-airing A&amp;E&#x27;s house-flipping shows and 30 potential shows were placed in development.

===as FYI (2014–present)===
In December 2013, A+E Networks announced that The Biography Channel would be rebranded as FYI, a contemporary lifestyle network, starting in mid 2014. By February, FYI had a slate of six new series including three food series, two home design series, and one style series, with other shows also in development, including pilot orders of &quot;Red Hot Design&quot; starring Shasta Smith, and &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Way&quot;. In April, &quot;Midnight Feast&quot; was greenlit for the new channel while two others—&quot;Say it to my face&quot; and &quot;Reverse Course—&quot;were ordered to pilot.

With the June 2014 announcement of the 2015 end of the ABC Owned Television Stations-run subscription network Live Well Network, some of its programming was being offered to FYI, which shared partial ABC ownership. The network launched on July 7, 2014, with a preview special, &quot;FYI: First Look&quot;, featuring previews of the network&#x27;s new programming. Its first new original series, &quot;Married at First Sight&quot;, premiered the next day.

In January 2015, following the success of its &quot;Six Months Later&quot; special, FYI ordered &quot;Married at First Sight: The First Year&quot;.

<doc id="809198" wikidata="Q1105238" url="?curid=809198" title="Cock and ball torture">
<text>Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving the application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing, or kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.

==Devices and practices ==

Similar to many other sexual activities, CBT can be performed using toys and devices to make the penis and testicles more easily accessible for attack or foreplay purposes.

===Ball stretcher===

A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is used to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. This can be particularly enjoyable for the wearer as it can make an orgasm more intense, as testicles are prevented from moving up. Intended to make one&#x27;s testicles hang lower than normal (temporarily or, if used regularly for extended periods of time, permanently), this sex toy can be potentially harmful to the genitals as the circulation of blood can be easily cut off if over-tightened.

Most ball stretchers are leather, rubber, or stainless steel. Leather ones usually are fastened with snaps, wrapping around the scrotum with the testicles hanging below. (See &quot;Testicle Cuffs&quot; below.) Rubber ones stretch enough for the testicles to pass through, and can be either a tube or a ring, where multiple rings can be added to create the desired length of &quot;stretch&quot;. The length of a stretcher can range from . Steel stretchers often use weight in addition to, or instead of, a physically restricted tube, to hold the testicles away from the torso. Steel weights need to come apart in order to fasten them securely around the scrotum. The removable segment might be held in place by friction, magnets, a set screw, or cap screws, and can range in weight from 150 grams to 1200 g or more. A more dangerous type of ball stretcher can be home-made simply by wrapping rope or string around one&#x27;s scrotum until it is eventually stretched to the desired length.

===Ball crusher===
A ball crusher is a device made from either metal or often clear acrylic that squeezes the testicles slowly by turning sets of nuts or screws. How tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. A ball crusher is often combined with bondage, either with a partner or by oneself, or with other types of torture or impact play.

===Parachute===
A parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. It is conical in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached.

Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and a squeezing effect on the testicles. Moderate weights of 3–5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage, though occasionally much heavier weights are used. Smaller weights can be used when the participant wearing it is free to move; the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.

===Humbler===
A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device, a cock-and-ball bondage toy used to restrict the movement of a submissive participant in a BDSM scene. It consists of a testicle cuff device, typically a ring, that clamps around the base of the scrotum while it is drawn back between the legs. This is mounted in the center of a bar or pair of rods that pass behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. As a result, the wearer is forced to keep their legs folded forward, as any attempt to straighten them even slightly pulls hard on the scrotum, causing anything from considerable discomfort to extreme pain. In this way the wearer is prevented from standing up straight and has to stay bent over or crawl on all fours.

===Testicle cuffs===
A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device that can be placed around the scrotum between the body and the testicles. When it is closed it prevents the testicles from passing through. A common type of testicle cuff consists of two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. Testicle cuffs are one of the many devices that are used to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock, which cannot be removed without its key, may also be locked around the scrotum.

Some passive participants enjoy the feeling of being &quot;owned&quot;, while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of &quot;owning&quot; their partners. Requiring such an individual wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that their sexual organs belong to their partner. There is a level of erotic humiliation involved, through which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may also form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or their partner.

However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:

* Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional few centimetres of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view.
* Improving sexual arousal. While some participants may be aroused by the feeling of being &quot;owned&quot;, the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one&#x27;s legs and pointing the toes.
* Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse.
* Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the &quot;point of no return&quot;. It is much harder to reach an orgasm.

===Cock harness===
A cock harness is a device designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. Early cock harnesses were used to prevent erections in a variety of ways; many of them caused pain in the penis, typically using sharp projections from cock rings or sometimes via electric shocks. These devices were designed for medical use, to prevent ejaculation while sleeping which was believed to cause &quot;seminal weakness&quot; and other physical problems. An example was the jugum penis.

Modern cock harnesses are penile sex toys and their use is associated with BDSM activities. 
=== Anti-erection devices ===
The Gates of Hell is a male chastity device made up of multiple cock rings that can be used for CBT. 
Kali&#x27;s Teeth is a metal bracelet with interior spikes that closes around the penis and can be used for preventing or punishing erections. Leather penis sheaths lined with internal spikes can be used for similar purposes.

=== Ball busting ===

&quot;Ball busting&quot; is the practice of kicking or kneeing participants in the testicles. It carries several medical risks, including the danger of testicular rupture from blunt trauma.

== In Japan ==
Tamakeri (玉蹴り) (lit. ball kicking) is a sexual fetish and subgenre of BDSM within which a man&#x27;s testicles are abused. The genre is also referred to as ballbusting (&quot;bb&quot; for short). Tamakeri is the Japanese term, but it is used by many non-Japanese people to describe media where Asian people—mainly women—are participating in it. The dynamics of tamakeri consist of a masochist having their testicles hurt by a sadist. The fetish is popular among heterosexual and homosexual men and women.

Denkianma (電気按摩) (lit. &quot;electric massage&quot;) is a popular Japanese prank played between two people where one person puts their foot into the genital area of the other and shakes it in a vibrating motion. Often this is done by grabbing the other person&#x27;s feet, raising them, and then placing one&#x27;s own foot on their crotch and vibrating it. This is often done between school aged boys as a prank similar to kancho and could be seen by a western audience as a type of bullying. In 2006, Frito Lay released a special, -themed edition of Doritos chips, that referenced denki anma.

== Safety ==
Loss of blood flow is one of the greatest risks in cock and ball torture and may cause irreversible damage. Bleeding is an indicator of unsafe behavior. Because numbness may result from circulation problems in the affected member, the level of pain is not an indicator of a problem and signs of danger include numbness or loss of color and edemas. Bondage in which the testicles are tied to another object is especially dangerous, increasing the risk of damaging the testicles through excessive tension or pulling.

The most serious injuries are testicular rupture, testicular torsion and testicular avulsion, which are medical emergencies that require urgent medical attention.

<doc id="809205" wikidata="Q19195" url="?curid=809205" title="Ridge Route">
<text>The Ridge Route, officially the Castaic–Tejon Route and colloquially known as the Grapevine, was a two-lane highway between Los Angeles County and Kern County, California. Opened in 1915 and paved with concrete between 1917 and 1921, the road was the first paved highway directly linking the Los Angeles Basin with the San Joaquin Valley (southern Central Valley) over the Tejon Pass and the rugged Sierra Pelona Mountains ridge south of Gorman. Much of the old road runs through the Angeles National Forest, and passes many historical landmarks, including the National Forest Inn, Reservoir Summit, Kelly&#x27;s Half Way Inn, Tumble Inn, and Sandberg&#x27;s Summit Hotel. North of the forest, the Ridge Route passed through Deadman&#x27;s Curve before ending at Grapevine.

The road was bypassed by the three-lane Ridge Route Alternate, then U.S. Route 99 (US 99), to handle increased traffic and remove curves; the Alternate in Los Angeles County was completed in 1933, and Kern County line to Grapevine in 1936. The four-lane US 99 was completed in 1953 and replaced by an eight-lane freeway, Interstate 5 (I-5) in 1960-70. The portion of the road in the Angeles National Forest was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997, by the efforts of Harrison Scott. Much of the road has been closed by the U.S. Forest Service; other remnants are used by local traffic.

==Route description==
The Ridge Route was officially the Castaic–Tejon Route. The official limits of the Ridge Route, as built in the 1910s, were SR 126 at Castaic Junction and the bottom of the grade at Grapevine. Until 1930 the road from San Fernando to Castaic Junction ran through the Newhall Tunnel at San Fernando Pass and along San Fernando Road, Magic Mountain Parkway (both part of SR 126 until the early 2000s) and Feedmill Road to a former bridge over the Santa Clara River. A 1930 bypass of the tunnel and Newhall through Weldon Canyon is now part of The Old Road.

From Castaic Junction north to Castaic the Ridge Route has been largely buried by the Ridge Route Alternate and Interstate 5. At Castaic the Ridge Route Alternate turned northwest from the old road, now the intersection of Castaic Road and Neely Street. The first piece of Ridge Route Road out of Castaic was realigned as recently as the late 1990s when the North Lake housing development was built. The road begins to climb after passing North Lake; a portion was straightened in 1924 and now is next to the southbound lanes of I-5. In this area, known as the Five-Mile Grade, the four-lane Ridge Route Alternate became the northbound lanes of I-5, while the added four-lane alignment, built to the east (next to the old Ridge Route), had lower grades and became the southbound (downhill) lanes to cut down on runaway trucks. Two bridges were built to allow traffic to cross to the left side. Near the north end of this area, the Ridge Route curves away from the newer bypass. The road enters the Angeles National Forest about south of Templin Highway, with the Forest Service road designation 8N04.

Establishments in the forest included the National Forest Inn, Kelly&#x27;s Half Way Inn, Tumble Inn, and Sandberg&#x27;s Summit Hotel.

The National Forest Inn was on the west side of the road. A popular place, composed of white clapboard buildings, it was described in a 1932 highway beautification pamphlet as &quot;the sort of filling station that gets into a national forest and is no addition thereto&quot;. On October 14, 1932, a fire began in the garage, and took over a day to put out. When the Ridge Route Alternate bypassed the site to the west, the inn was not rebuilt, and all that remains are concrete steps.

About north of the National Forest Inn is Serpentine Drive, where the road curves around the sides of hills as it climbs out of a low point in the route (about above sea level). North of the curves, the road passes through Swede&#x27;s Cut, also called Big Cut, Culebra Excavation, or Castaic Cut. The cut was the largest on the route, with a depth of .

Reservoir Summit, also called Reservoir Hill, is above sea level. The Reservoir Summit Café was a popular high-class restaurant on the east side of the road, closed in the late 1920s; the foundation remains. The summit was named after a now-dry reservoir, one of three probably built for the concrete used in paving the road. Kelly&#x27;s Half Way Inn was roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Bakersfield, on a small knoll with a single tree on the east side of the road; all that remains is remnants of the foundation. The Tumble Inn, later Mountain View Lodge, was on the west side of the road, and closed when the Ridge Route Alternate opened in 1933. Steps, including the top step with &quot;TUMBLE INN&quot; in the concrete, and a retaining wall remain.
The Sandberg&#x27;s Summit Hotel, later Sandberg&#x27;s Lodge, was just north of Liebre Summit, the highest point () on the road, at above sea level. The hotel was built in 1914 and served travelers from the opening of the road in 1915. Built of logs, it was a high-class hotel. The place, which had become a ceramics factory, burned down on April 29, 1961, from a fire started by the new owner—who was converting it into a &quot;camp-type operation&quot; for underprivileged children—burning trash in the fireplace. The lease from the U.S. Forest Service was canceled in 1963, and only portions of the foundation and a rock wall remain. The name &quot;Sandberg&quot; is still used by the National Weather Service for an automated weather station a short distance to the north at Pine Canyon Road. Pine Canyon Road (CR N2) marks the end of the forest and the beginning of county maintenance, and CR N2 uses the old Ridge Route alignment to reach SR 138 near Quail Lake.
The Ridge Route crosses the West Branch California Aqueduct with SR 138, splitting to the northwest on Gorman Post Road. It rejoins the path of I-5 at Gorman, and, from Gorman to the end at Grapevine, most of the old road has been covered by the Ridge Route Alternate or I-5. The path of the Ridge Route is now named Peace Valley Road and Lebec Road, passing over Tejon Pass and past Lebec and Fort Tejon. Past Fort Tejon the route descends through Grapevine Canyon to Grapevine (named for grapevines in the area). The best-known curve on the road, Deadman&#x27;s Curve or Death Curve is visible from Digier Road on the west side of I-5. The next part of the old road that still exists is near the bottom of the grade, where a number of curves brought the road down to Grapevine. The original plan was to build the road nearer to the center of the canyon, but a March 1914 flood destroyed the work, and the grading was redone higher up. Deadman&#x27;s Curve and the Grapevine loops were both bypassed by the Ridge Route Alternate, which was built directly over most of the old road in this area. At Grapevine the land flattens out, and the road north of Grapevine was the longest straight section of road in the state——in 1926. Most of this road lies under I-5 and SR 99, but the southernmost piece in Grapevine was bypassed by the Alternate west of it, and is now between southbound and northbound lanes of I-5.

==History==

===Before the Ridge Route===
Before the Ridge Route, roads between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley were less direct. El Camino Real (Spanish, &quot;the King&#x27;s road&quot;), the first major road in California, connected Los Angeles and the missions, presidios and settlements with San Francisco and Sonoma. The San Joaquin Valley route split from the El Camino Real at present-day Universal City, the western leg running along the Pacific Coast and coastal valleys and the eastern El Camino Viejo, (Spanish, &quot;the old road&quot;) via the San Joaquin Valley to San Antonio, now East Oakland.

Another route between Los Angeles and Bakersfield followed the southern approach to the Ridge Route to Saugus, but took a longer route between Saugus and Gorman, heading northeast through the San Francisquito Canyon to the Antelope Valley and west to Gorman. The rest of the route, from Gorman toward Bakersfield via the Tejon Pass, followed the same path as the Ridge Route.

The Butterfield Overland Stage, the first overland mail service to California, went from Tipton, Missouri and Memphis to San Francisco via Los Angeles. From October 1858, when the first stage passed through Tejon Pass, until April 1861, the route was identical to El Camino Viejo, running via San Francisquito Canyon. In order to keep the stages from running directly northwest from San Bernardino and bypassing Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors spent $8000 in 1858 (about $ in ) to deepen the cut—later Beale&#x27;s Cut—at San Fernando Pass, south of Saugus and Newhall (east of Sierra Highway, west of the Antelope Valley Freeway or State Route 14). The path followed by the stages was changed to pass along the Pacific Coast from Los Angeles in April 1861.

Similarly, the residents of the City of Los Angeles approved the expenditure of a good deal of money towards the building of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which had originally planned to bypass the city. The line to San Francisco, including the San Fernando Tunnel through San Fernando Pass, was completed on September 5, 1876. The railroad&#x27;s route between Saugus and Bakersfield was even longer than that of El Camino Viejo and the Butterfield Overland Stage, heading east through Soledad Canyon before turning north via Palmdale to Mojave and northwest over Tehachapi Pass.

In the 1910s several power companies built lines through the area. The General Pipe Line Company completed an oil pipeline connecting the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s Midway-Sunset Oil Field with the port at San Pedro in 1913. Its alignment followed the Ridge Route north of Gorman and south of Reservoir Summit, a longer distance than any of the earlier transportation routes, but from Gorman south to the present location of Pyramid Lake, where it turned east to Reservoir Summit, it roughly followed the later Ridge Route Alternate. That same year, the Midway Gas Company opened a natural gas line, and the Pacific Light and Power Company opened a power line, both staying fairly close to the entire Ridge Route.

The two general routes followed by the Butterfield Overland Stage and the Southern Pacific Railroad—known respectively as the Tejon Pass Route and the Tehachapi or Midway Route—were the main automobile routes between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley around the start of the 20th century. The State Bureau of Highways recommended in 1895 that a more direct route be built to shorten this distance. A bond issue was approved in 1909 and 1910 to build a state highway system, including the Ridge Route. The new California Highway Commission was unable to raise funds in the East, but Los Angeles again contributed funds to ensure that construction would go forward.

These routes all shared the roadway south of Saugus, which was generally flat but included the crossing of San Fernando Pass. As discussed earlier, this was deepened at the county&#x27;s expense in 1858. The California State Legislature authorized a turnpike in 1861, and it was completed in 1863, then owned by Edward Fitzgerald Beale. The cut, which came to be known as Beale&#x27;s Cut, was deepened by Beale, and lowered once more by the county in 1904. To improve the crossing, the county bypassed the cut with the narrow Newhall Tunnel, for railroad traffic only, which opened in October 1910.

===Construction===
The California Highway Commission considered several easterly routes between Saugus and Gorman: Soledad Canyon (used by the Southern Pacific) had frequent washouts; Mint Canyon (used by the Midway Route) was too long and cost too much; Bouquet Canyon (used by both automobile routes) had bad drainage; and San Francisquito Canyon (used by the Tejon Pass Route) was steep and narrow. Another possible route, through Piru Canyon to the west, was rejected because of a proposal for a dam. This route was later chosen for the &quot;Ridge Route Alternate&quot;, but had to be abandoned in the 1970s due to the construction of Pyramid Lake.


The route chosen was direct from Saugus to Gorman, over the top of the ridge for many miles. Due to cost and drainage concerns, and a desire to reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697 curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) to the bottom of the grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. Horse-drawn scrapers were used.

The new road, designed with an ideal grade of 6 percent (but with several 7 percent grades, including at Grapevine,) cut the distance by over the Tejon Pass Route or over the Midway Route. A speed limit of was enforced between Castaic and Quail Lake, making the trip from Los Angeles to Bakersfield take about 12 hours. On the Ridge Route between Castaic Junction and Grapevine, the curves added up to about 109.5 complete circles, with a minimum radius of . The unpaved road, which had cost $450,000 (about $ in ), opened in October 1915.

In addition to being part of the state highway system (as a portion of the unsigned Sacramento-Los Angeles Legislative Route 4), the road was part of the National Park to Park Highway, a privately designated auto trail, and became part of US 99 in 1926. The continuation south via Saugus and the Newhall Tunnel towards Los Angeles, also part of Route 4, was added to the state highway system in 1917.

The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the new route &quot;one of the most remarkable engineering feats accomplished by the State Highway Commission. It is Southern California&#x27;s Magnus Opus [&quot;sic&quot;] in mountain highway construction.&quot; It was also credited with stopping efforts to split California into two states, by linking its two halves over the rugged terrain separating them.

Work on paving the Ridge Route with thick reinforced concrete began in 1917, but was delayed until 1919 by the U.S. entry into World War I. During work on the road, traffic was detoured via Mint and Bouquet Canyons. The road reopened on November 15, 1919, completely paved except north of Lebec, including the grade at Grapevine, which was only oiled. After a bond issue was passed in July 1919, this portion was paved from September 1919 to May 1921; the dangerous detour during the paving included a 20 percent grade. The paving added about $1 million to the cost, for a total price of about $1.5 million (about $ in ), which was not paid off until 1965. Asphalt was added on top of the concrete for south from Swede&#x27;s Cut in 1922, and in 1924 a number of blind curves were widened and straightened.

===Bypasses and the fate of the bypassed road===
In 1929 the state decided to build a new bypass of the central portion through Piru Canyon, and to upgrade the north portion over Tejon Pass and down the hill to Grapevine. This Ridge Route Alternate, or Ridge Alternate Highway, shortened the route by and increased the minimum curve radius from . This was done for the safety of the road, which had many accidents, and to increase the road&#x27;s capacity. The old highway was to be relinquished to Los Angeles County and incorporated into the county road system. Construction began in 1930, and the road south of Tejon Pass opened on October 29, 1933; replacement of the Grapevine grade was completed in 1936. The three-lane road, with a center &quot;suicide&quot; passing lane, cost $3.5 million (about $ in ), paid for by the state gas tax. It was estimated that it would pay itself off in 2.5 years with the savings in time and gas. A new bypass of the Newhall Tunnel, through Weldon Canyon, had opened on May 28, 1930, giving drivers a better route all the way from Los Angeles to Bakersfield. The roadway was widened to an expressway by 1952 at a cost of $13.5 million (about $ in ), with two lanes in each direction and a center median, but still with at-grade intersections. 

Even this four-lane Ridge Route Alternate was not adequate for the traffic, and the first section of eight-lane freeway I-5 with a minimum curve radius of opened in 1960 in Grapevine. Large parts of the Ridge Route Alternate were incorporated into the new roadway, but the area through the present Pyramid Lake was completely bypassed. I-5 over the mountains between Castaic Junction and Grapevine was completed on August 24, 1970, at a cost of $103 million (about $ in ).
Portions of the old road continued to exist as a county road. The longest preserved segment was the part bypassed by the Ridge Route Alternate, between Castaic and SR 138 near Sandberg, including the portion through the Angeles National Forest. The road for about south from SR 138 is part of CR N2.

Harrison Scott, a retired engineer, was traveling north on I-5 with his son in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR 138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn&#x27;t know who maintained it through the desert. It turned out that the county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the Santa Anita Canyon Road, then a county road.
For the next six years Scott worked to get the road added to the National Register of Historic Places, and finally succeeded when, on September 25, 1997, the National Park Service added the in the forest to the National Register. He later used his research for the National Register application to write a book, &quot;Ridge Route: The Road That United California&quot;, published in 2002. The Ridge Route was also designated as a California Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2008.

The route was repaired in 2005 following heavy rainfall, but the road was not reopened , due to objections from Angeles National Forest officials.

<doc id="809206" wikidata="Q7734526" url="?curid=809206" title="The Flow of (u)">
<text>The Flow of (u) is a piece of music for three voices by Kenneth Gaburo, composed in 1974.

The piece consists of &quot;one note sung by three singers for twenty-three minutes&quot; on &quot;u&quot; whose goal is &quot;to sing in tune to such an extent that … this would consist of phase-coherent waves of sound.&quot; This, however, proves impossible, as singers must breathe, beating occurs between nearly in tune pitches, and the frequency spectrum or harmonics: &quot;Gently changing balances between the voices would result in very subtle glissandi of the harmonics of the spectrum being heard.&quot; The piece creates a &quot;(sonic) universe in this (linguistic) &#x27;grain of sand&#x27;&quot;.

Unlike other minimalist works in which, compared to serial music, &quot;a certain level of articulational subtlety is eschewed in favor of an overall psycho-acoustic effect,&quot; in Gaburo&#x27;s piece &quot;the focus is even more intense, and the attention to dynamic shaping given to the lines … is here transferred to the micro-level&quot;.

An earlier work from Gaburo&#x27;s Lingua series, &quot;Lingua IV&quot; (1970), for various media, bears a similar subtitle: &quot;The Flow of (i)2&quot;.

<doc id="809210" wikidata="Q43080" url="?curid=809210" title="Roller derby">
<text>Roller derby is a roller skating contact sport played on an oval track by two teams of five skaters. It is played by approximately 1,250 amateur leagues worldwide, though it is most popular in the United States.

A 60-minute roller derby game, or &quot;bout&quot;, is a series of two-minute timed &quot;jams&quot;. Each team, typically with a roster of 15, fields five skaters during each jam: one &quot;jammer&quot;, designated with a star on their helmet, and four &quot;blockers&quot;. During each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. The jammer scores a point for each opposing blocker they lap. The blockers simultaneously defend by hindering the opposing jammer, while also playing offense by maneuvering to aid their own jammer. Because roller derby uses a penalty box, power jams, in which one team has a temporary numerical advantage after a foul, can have a major effect on scoring.

==Overview==
While the sport has its origins in the banked-track roller-skating marathons of the 1930s, Leo Seltzer and Damon Runyon are credited with evolving the sport to its competitive form. Professional roller derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing decades, however, it predominantly became a form of sports entertainment, where theatrical elements overshadowed athleticism. Gratuitous showmanship largely ended with the sport&#x27;s grassroots revival in the first decade of the 21st century. Although roller derby retains some sports entertainment qualities such as player pseudonyms and colorful uniforms, it has abandoned scripted bouts with predetermined winners.

Modern roller derby is an international sport, mostly played by amateurs. It was under consideration as a roller sport for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS), recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the official international governing body of roller sports, released its first set of Roller Derby Rules for the World Roller Games, organised by World Skate, that took place September 2017 in Nanjing, China. Most modern leagues (and their back-office volunteers) share a strong &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; ethic that combines athleticism with the styles of punk and camp. , the Women&#x27;s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) had 451 full member leagues and 46 apprentice leagues and the Roller Derby Coalition of Leagues (RDCL) supporting women&#x27;s banked track roller derby had eight full member leagues.

==Rules==
Contemporary roller derby has a basic set of rules, with variations reflecting the interests of a governing body&#x27;s member leagues. The summary below is based on the rules of the Women&#x27;s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA). In March 2010, Derby News Network said that more than 98% of roller derby competitions were conducted under WFTDA rules. For example, members of the United Kingdom Roller Derby Association are required to play by WFTDA rules, while members of the former Canadian Women&#x27;s Roller Derby Association were encouraged to join the WFTDA.

===Basics of play===

Roller derby is played in two periods of 30 minutes. Two teams of up to 15 players each field up to five members for episodes called &quot;jams&quot;. Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely. Each team designates a scoring player (the &quot;jammer&quot;); the other four members are &quot;blockers&quot;. One blocker can be designated as a &quot;pivot&quot;—a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play. The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.

During each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team&#x27;s jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another &quot;trip&quot; through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any opposing blocker. The rules describe an &quot;earned&quot; pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer&#x27;s first earned pass scores a point for passing that blocker and a point for each opponent blocker not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack, it is a four-point scoring trip, commonly called a &quot;grand slam&quot;.

Each team&#x27;s blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team&#x27;s jammer.

===Jams===
Play begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the &quot;jammer line&quot; and the &quot;pivot line&quot; 30 feet in front. The jammers start behind the jammer line. Jams begin on a single short whistle blast, upon which both jammers and blockers may begin engaging immediately.

The pack is the largest single group of blockers containing members of both teams skating in proximity, arranged such that each player is within 10 feet of the next. Blockers must maintain the pack, but can skate freely within 20 feet behind and ahead of it, an area known as the &quot;engagement zone&quot;.

The first jammer to break through the pack earns the status of &quot;lead jammer&quot;. A designated referee blows the whistle twice and continually points at the jammer to confer lead jammer status, which lets that jammer stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing hands on hips. Lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (such as being sent to the penalty box) cancel lead jammer status, meaning that the jam has no lead jammer and must continue for the full two-minute period. If the jam is not called off by the lead jammer, it ends after two minutes. If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam. If the 30-minute period ends while a jam is underway, the jam plays out to its natural conclusion.

===Blocking===
A skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds. The blocker must be upright, skating counterclockwise, in bounds, and within the engagement zone. Groups of blockers on the same team typically create formations, known as walls, to prevent the opposing blocker from passing. Blocking with hands, elbows, head, and feet is prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders, below mid-thigh, or to the back.

===Penalties===
Referees penalize rules violations. A player receiving a penalty is removed from play and must sit in the penalty box for 30 seconds of jam time. If the jam ends during this interval, the player remains in the penalty box during the subsequent jam until the interval ends. While the penalty is being served, the penalized player&#x27;s team plays short-handed, as in ice hockey. A player &quot;fouls out&quot; of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.

A &quot;power jam&quot;, derived from ice hockey&#x27;s &quot;power play&quot;, refers to a scenario when one team&#x27;s jammer is sent to the penalty box. In this case, that jammer&#x27;s team cannot score. If the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.

It would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, both jammers cannot serve a penalty at the same time. If one jammer is sent to the penalty box while the opposing jammer is already serving a penalty, the opposing jammer is released from the penalty box early. The second jammer&#x27;s penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box.

===Equipment===

Players skate on four-wheeled (&quot;quad&quot;) roller skates, and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid inline skates for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and sex-specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra and protective cups.

==Strategy and tactics==
Offense and defense are played simultaneously, a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics. For example, one team&#x27;s blockers may take offensive action to create a gap in the opposing wall for their jammer to pass through, but this same maneuver could potentially weaken their own defenses and allow the opposing team&#x27;s jammer to score.

Strategies (high-level plans toward achieving the game&#x27;s goal, which is to outscore the opposition) include the following:
*Ending the jam: The lead jammer can &quot;call off&quot; or end the jam at any time, controlling the opposition&#x27;s ability to score points. The strategy for a jam is not to score a lot of points but to outscore the opposition. Often, the lead jammer scores as many points as possible on the first scoring trip, and then ends the jam before the opposing jammer has the opportunity to score any points. If the jammer gets the lead but is then passed by the opposing jammer, they may decide to call off the jam without scoring any points themselves in order to prevent the other team&#x27;s jammer from scoring any points.
*Passing the star: The jammer for a team may &quot;pass the star&quot; (may perform a &quot;star pass&quot;) to the pivot—that is, hand the helmet cover with the star to the pivot, which turns the pivot into the jammer. Passing the star does not nullify any earned pass of an opponent that the former jammer made, but passing the star forward never constitutes an earned pass. A jammer might pass the star because of fatigue, injury, or because the pivot is in a better position to score. Passing the star is also sometimes referred to as &quot;passing the panty&quot;, as helmet covers are sometimes known as &quot;panties&quot;.
*Killing a penalty: Captained by the pivot, blockers adapt their play to a penalty situation. For example, a short-handed team may try to make the pack skate faster to slow down scoring action until the team returns to full strength.

Tactics (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:
*Walling up: Two or more blockers skate together to make it difficult for the opposing team (especially its jammer) to maneuver. They may skate side by side and use a &quot;wide stance&quot; to maximize the blockade, but must not link with or grasp each other, or otherwise form an impenetrable connection. The ability to suddenly form a wall denies the opposition time to respond. A wall can inhibit, slow down, and ultimately trap the opposing jammer. An effective wall may last for an entire jam. Variations on the tactic include the following:
**Backwards bracing, in which one skater, forward of the wall, skates backward to sight the jammer and direct teammates forming the wall.
**A skater may break off from the wall to actively challenge the opposing jammer, with a teammate replacing the skater in the wall.
**If the opposing jammer tries to pass the wall on one side, players may abandon the other side to fortify the active side of the wall.

*Jammer tactics, in response to a wall or other obstacles by the opposing team&#x27;s defense, include the following:
**Pushing through gaps in the wall or inducing the wall to separate by use of physical force.
**Evading the obstacle to one side or the other.
**Juking, where the jammer seems to be skating to one side but quickly shifts to the other side.
**Rolling around the end of the obstacle (spinning 360°) to end up ahead of it.
**Using teammates to impede the defense from adjusting, such as by setting screens.
**Using a whip, where one or more teammates grasp the jammer&#x27;s hand(s) and swing the jammer forward, transferring speed and momentum to the jammer.
**Apex Jump: Using the inside curve of the track to leap out of bounds but land in bounds, passing opposing players.
*Goating: The pack is defined as &quot;the largest group of in-bounds blockers, skating in proximity, containing members from both teams.&quot; In the &quot;goat-herding&quot; tactic, one team surrounds a blocker of the opposing team and then slows so that that group becomes the pack. The rest of the opposing team, skating ahead, are thus put out of play and cannot legally block the goat-herders&#x27; jammer.
*Running back or recycling: When a skater bumps the opponent jammer off the track, the jammer can only re-enter the track behind the skater. The skater skates clockwise on the track toward the rear of the engagement zone to maximize the time the jammer must spend before returning to action.
*Bridging: By separating up to 10 feet, blockers can stretch both the pack and the engagement zone, allowing teammates to keep hindering the opposition jammer. For example, in the strategy of running back (see above), coordinated action by the four skaters other than the jammer could force the opponent jammer to detour a full 40 feet before returning to action.

==Officials==
WFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees and many non-skating officials (NSOs). Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.

===Referees===
Up to four referees skate on the inside of the track. In flat-track derby, up to three additional referees skate on the outside of the track. They call penalties, award points, and ensure safe game play. Referees must wear skates and typically wear white and black stripes.

===Non-skating officials (NSOs)===
NSOs take up a range of positions inside and outside the track, start and time the jams, record and display scores and penalties communicated by referees, record the number of each skater on track for a given jam, and time and record skaters in the penalty box.

==History==

===Professional endurance races===
 The growing popularity of roller skating in the United States led to the formation of organized multi-day endurance races for cash prizes as early as the mid-1880s. Speed and endurance races continued to be held on both flat and banked tracks in the century&#x27;s first three decades and spectators enjoyed the spills and falls of the skaters. The term &quot;derby&quot; was used to refer to such races by 1922.

===Evolution to contact sport===
The endurance races began to transform into the contemporary form of the sport in the mid-1930s, when promoter Leo Seltzer created the Transcontinental Roller Derby, a month-long simulation of a road race between two-person teams of professional skaters. The spectacle became a popular touring exhibition. In the late 1930s, sportswriter Damon Runyon persuaded Seltzer to change the Roller Derby rules to increase skater contact. By 1939, after experimenting with different team and scoring arrangements, Seltzer&#x27;s created a touring company of four pairs of teams (always billed as the local &quot;home&quot; team versus either New York or Chicago), with two five-person teams on the track at once, scoring points when its members lapped opponents.

===Television===
On November 29, 1948, before television viewership was widespread, &quot;Roller Derby&quot; debuted on New York television. The broadcasts increased spectator turnout for live matches. For the 1949–1950 season, Seltzer formed the National Roller Derby League (NRDL), comprising six teams. NRDL season playoffs sold out Madison Square Garden for a week. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the sport was broadcast on several networks, but attendance declined. Jerry Seltzer (Leo&#x27;s son), the &quot;Roller Derby&quot; &quot;commissioner&quot;, hoped to use television to expand the live spectator base. He adapted the sport for television by developing scripted story lines and rules designed to improve television appeal, but derby&#x27;s popularity had declined.

1989 saw the debut of &quot;RollerGames,&quot; an even more theatrical variant of roller derby for national audiences. It used a figure-8 track and rules adapted for this track. Bill Griffiths, Sr. served as commissioner while his son, Bill Griffiths, Jr., managed the L.A. T-Birds, who (according to the storyline) were seeking revenge on the Violators (led by Skull) for cheating in the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup. The other teams included the Maniacs (led by Guru Drew), Bad Attitude (led by Ms. Georgia Hase), the Rockers (led by DJ Terringo and consisting of skaters who were also professional rock and roll musicians), and Hot Flash (led by Juan Valdez Lopez). It ran one season, because some of its syndicators went bankrupt.

In 1999, TNN debuted &quot;RollerJam,&quot; which used the classic rules and banked oval track, but allowed inline skates (although some skaters wore traditional quad skates). Jerry Seltzer was commissioner for this version.

==Contemporary roller derby==

===Amateur revival===

Roller derby began its modern revival in Austin, Texas in the early 2000s as an all-female, woman-organized amateur sport. By August 2006, there were over 135 similar leagues. Leagues outside the U.S. also began forming in 2006, and international competition soon followed. There are over 2,000 amateur leagues worldwide in countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Germany, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Israel, Singapore, UAE, Egypt, Thailand, and China. In many international leagues, gear and equipment must be imported. Roller derby&#x27;s contemporary resurgence has been regarded as an aspect of globalization which demonstrates &quot;the speed with which pop culture is now transported by highly mobile expatriates and social media, while also highlighting the changing role of women in many societies&quot;.

Many roller derby leagues are amateur, self-organized and all-female and were formed in a do-it-yourself spirit by relatively new enthusiasts. In many leagues (especially in the U.S.), a punk aesthetic and/or third-wave feminist ethic is prominent. Members of fledgling leagues often practice and strategize together, regardless of team affiliation, between bouts. Most compete on flat tracks, though several leagues skate on banked tracks, with more in the planning stages.

Each league typically features local teams in public bouts that are popular with a diverse fan base. Some venues host audiences ranging up to 7,000. Successful local leagues have formed traveling teams comprising the league&#x27;s best players to compete with comparable teams from other cities and regions. In February 2012, the International Olympic Committee considered roller derby, amongst eight other sports, for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic Games.

In 2009, the feature film &quot;Whip It&quot; featured roller derby and introduced a wider audience to the sport. The WFTDA encouraged leagues to coordinate with promotions during the film&#x27;s release to increase awareness of the leagues. Furthermore, corporate advertising has used roller derby themes in television commercials for insurance, a breakfast cereal, and an over-the-counter analgesic.

===Derby names===


Most players in roller leagues skate under pseudonyms, also called &quot;derby names&quot; or &quot;skater names&quot;. These typically use word play with satirical, mock-violent or sexual puns, alliteration, and allusions to pop culture. Referees often use derby names as well, often shown on the backs of their striped uniforms. Some players claim their names represent alter egos that they adopt while skating.

Whether a team should skate under real names or derby names is sometimes debated. Some derby names are obscene, a subject of some internal controversy.

Copying of derby names has attracted legal and sociological analysis as an example of indigenous development of property rights. New players are encouraged to check derby names against an international roster to ensure they are not already in use.

The names of roller derby events are also as sardonic and convoluted—for example, Night of the Rolling Dead (&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;), Knocktoberfest (Oktoberfest), Spanksgiving (Thanksgiving), Seasons Beatings (Seasons Greetings), Grandma Got Run Over By a Rollergirl (&quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot;), Cinco de May-hem (Cinco de Mayo), and War of the Wheels (&quot;War of the Worlds&quot;).

===Safety===

Roller derby is a contact sport, and injuries can occur. Superficial injuries include bruising. However, torn ligaments, broken bones, and concussions also occur.

Some leagues prominently display their injuries, to embellish the image of violence or machismo. However, some skaters say the sport is reasonably safe if skaters take precautions. The rules require appropriate medical professionals on-site at every bout, even if not required by laws or arena regulations. The WFTDA offers insurance for leagues in the United States with legal liability and accident coverage, but it recommends that skaters also carry their own primary medical insurance.

===Expansion===
Although the early 2000s revival of roller derby was initially all-female, some leagues later introduced all-male teams and all-gender games; there were over 140 junior roller derby programs in the United States, and many more around the world.

College roller derby is also expanding in the United States. The University of Arizona&#x27;s Derby Cats describe themselves as the first-ever official college flat-track roller derby team. The first intercollegiate derby bout took place on March 3, 2018, when the Claremont Colleges roller derby team defeated Arizona State University.

The website FlatTrackStats compiles ratings of WFTDA teams, adjusting them after every bout based on how the actual score compares to the predicted score. The WFTDA&#x27;s own Stats Repository has comparable information and often is updated at halftime of a bout.

Roller derby bouts are now streamed online, and there are archived videos of past bouts and tournaments. The WFTDA offers live streaming video of its tournaments at wftda.tv. Derby News Network offered live streaming video and archived video including events outside the WFTDA.

&quot;FiveOnFive&quot; magazine covers roller derby and diverse aspects such as business, training, junior roller derby, and nutrition.

==Governance and organization==
The largest governing body for the sport is the Women&#x27;s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), with 397 full member leagues and 48 apprentice leagues. WFTDA membership is a major goal of aspiring leagues. Other associations support either mixed-gender or men-only derby; the largest organization supporting male roller derby is the Men&#x27;s Roller Derby Association (MRDA). Within the United States, the Junior Roller Derby Association governs play by those under 18. It modifies the WFTDA rules for minors at three skill levels, with the lowest level allowing no intentional contact between skaters, and the highest allowing full contact; additional rules are also changed according to the needs of youth skaters. Some U.S. leagues decline affiliation with a national organization because they prefer local governance.

Although WFTDA has been the largest worldwide roller-derby organization, the IOC has recognized World Skate (formerly Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports) as the only governing body able to sanction international roller derby competitions within the Olympic Movement. Disputes between World Skate and WFTDA has meant that only 4 teams were present in the first Roller Derby World Championships organized by World Skate in 2017, as part of the 2017 World Roller Games

USA Roller Sports (USARS) is recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) as the National Governing Body of competitive roller sports in the United States, including speed, figure, hockey, roller derby and slalom. WFTDA and USARS maintain a reciprocity agreement for insurance purposes.

Outside the United States, many roller derby leagues enjoy support from their national skate federations, such as Skate Australia, the British Roller Sports Federation, and Roller Sports Canada. In Europe, roller derby was recognized as a sport in Paris in 2010 by the Federation Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS), which reports directly to the International Olympic Committee. As of 2017, FIRS has been accepted as the international rule set by the International Olympic Committee. Teams competed under the FIRS rules at the 2017 Nanjing Games. The former Canadian Women&#x27;s Roller Derby Association worked with the American federation.

===Tournaments===
Since 2006, the WFTDA has sponsored an annual championship. In 2008, it adopted the &quot;Big 5&quot; format: four regional playoffs and a final championship tournament. As of 2019, the WFTDA postseason includes two playoffs that feed into the Championship tournament, plus three standalone, regionally-based Continental Cups. The WFTDA also recognizes eligible tournaments hosted by member leagues.

Internationally, the first Roller Derby World Cup took place in Toronto, Canada, in December 2011. The second World Cup took place in Dallas, Texas, in December 2014.

Since 2012, USARS has held an annual Roller Derby National Championship. In 2017, FIRS and the USOC recognized USARS to participate in the 2017 Nanjing games.

The largest roller derby tournament in the southern hemisphere, The Great Southern Slam, has been held biannually in Adelaide, South Australia since 2010.

==Social significance==
Zaina Arafat said in the &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; that roller derby defies heteronormativity and patriarchal standards. In Egypt, Arafat says, there are expectations that a woman will not show visible scars, will have an unblemished body for her husband, and will refrain from activities that may damage her body. She says roller derby in Egypt is subversive, as it acts as an indirect political statement.

Author Carly Giesler said that skaters enact sexualities that create or reclaim an identity, and their role parodies &quot;hegemonic scripts of sexuality&quot; through the use of costumes, derby names and personas. Roller derby acts as a unique stage for female athletes, letting them rebut constraints society places on women and female athletes. Giesler said that female sports objectifies them for the male gaze, but roller derby turns this on its head by disregarding gender roles and norms.

<text>St. Clair College of Applied Arts and Technology is a college in the Southwestern Ontario counties of Essex and Chatham-Kent, partnered with private Ace Acumen Academy in Toronto. 

==Campus==
Its main administration and largest campus sites are in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. In addition, other campuses are located in Chatham and Wallaceburg. In 2007, St. Clair College expanded to downtown Windsor by purchasing the former City of Windsor owned Cleary International Centre, renaming it St. Clair College Centre for the Arts. In 2009, St. Clair College bought the former City of Windsor owned Salvation Army building in downtown Windsor for $1. With a $5 million grant from the federal government, the building was turned into a state of the art journalism school; the first of its kind in Canada. In 2014, St. Clair College built a new sports complex at the main campus, called the SportsPlex.

==History==
The college has its roots in the Western Ontario Institute of Technology, founded in 1958 to supplement the then-Ryerson Institute in Toronto, now Toronto Metropolitan University. With the advent of the Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology, St. Clair was founded in 1966; the two institutions were merged a year later. Growth of the college has generally paralleled that of Windsor. Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965. It is an Ontario College of Applied Arts and Technology. The school was founded in 1966 as part of a provincial initiative to create many such institutions to provide career-oriented diploma and certificate courses, as well as continuing education programs to Ontario communities.

In 2018 annual college revenue sat at roughly $150 million. By 2021-22 St. Clair College&#x27;s student headcount of international students exceeded domestic students. The unprecedented growth in international student enrolment has not been met with a corresponding increase in student housing at St. Clair College. By 2024 annual college revenue was over $300 million with more than $200 million coming from foreign student tuition. Student-led protest claimed the college was issuing failing grades to increase tuition.

==Career==
Sugita was born in Ranzan, Saitama. When he was in elementary school and watched the TV anime &quot;Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai&quot;, he noticed that the character Hyunckel had a much lower voice than he had imagined from reading the original manga, and thought he was &quot;still cool,&quot; but the moment he said his special move, Sugita realized that it was the same voice as Phoenix Ikki from &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; (Hideyuki Hori). In junior high school, he was a member of the tennis club and served as the head of the club, while in high school, he joined the Shorinji Kempo club (1-dan). When he was a child, he wanted to be a temple priest, and in high school he wanted to be a home economics teacher, a confectioner, or a designer. At the time, when he thought about writing a script for a stage performance at a school event and added sound effects and background music to a recording of his own voice, his older brother heard it and suggested that he try to find a job that made use of him voice and speech, which led him to become a voice actor. While still in high school, he won the Myuras &amp; Animage Award at the Voice Actor Spring School sponsored by the Japan Narration Actor Institute, and entered the Myuras Actors School (now the Vocal and Dance Division of the Japan Narration Actor Institute), while at the same time belonging to the Myuras entertainment agency. At the age of 17, he made his voice acting debut as a gift announcement narrator for &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; on SKY PerfecTV!.

In 1999, when he was a prep school student, he got his first regular role in an anime production with &quot;Cybuster&quot;, and continued his voice acting career while studying until he graduated from university. After the dissolution of Myuras in 2001, he joined Atomic Monkey after a period of freelancing, and made his first leading role playing Hideki Motosuwa in the anime series &quot;Chobits&quot;.

Sugita played the leading roles in both &quot;Gintama&quot; (Gintoki Sakata) and &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; (Kyon), greatly increasing his fame. In 2009, he won the Best Actor in supporting role award at the 3rd Seiyu Awards. In October 2013, he won the Male Voice Actor Award at the &quot;Newtype x Machi★Asobi Anime Awards 2013&quot;, and his role in &quot;Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet&quot;, Chamber K6821, also won the Mascot Character Award.

In 2010, he starred in a live-action film &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, alongside Mamoru Miyano, Tomokazu Seki, Rikiya Koyama, Yuka Hirata, Showtaro Morikubo and Daisuke Namikawa. On April 1, 2020, Sugita left Atomic Monkey, the company he had been affiliated with for many years, and established AGRS Inc. with Kai Itō, a lawyer well versed in the entertainment industry, as an advisor and himself as the representative director.

==Personal life==
Sugita previously owned a mongrel dog named &quot;Naoji&quot; () which was adopted by his father from the original owner. He has once taken a commercial for 4gamer with his dog. Naoji died on 6 September 2018 at 17.

<text>The president of the Republic of Texas () was the head of state and head of government while Texas was an independent republic between 1836 and 1845. The president served as the commander-in-chief of the Texas Military Forces.

==History and duties==
The Republic of Texas was formed in 1836. In the midst of the Texas Revolution, Texan settlers elected delegates to the Convention of 1836, which issued the Texas Declaration of Independence and elected David G. Burnet as interim president of the new country. In May 1836 Burnet and Mexican dictator Antonio López de Santa Anna, who was at the time a Texan prisoner-of-war, signed the Treaties of Velasco officially recognizing Texas&#x27;s break from Mexico.

The authority and responsibilities of the president were similar to that of the president of the United States: to serve the people of Texas, and to serve as the head of the military and the state. These were detailed in the Constitution of the Republic of Texas of 1836. The Constitution specified a term of two years for the first elected president (Sam Houston) and terms of three years thereafter; the president could not succeed himself, but there were otherwise no term limits. The president was elected separately from the vice president, by popular vote, and there was no requirement to be native-born. A strict reading of the Constitution provided for women&#x27;s suffrage (that is, both men and women were citizens and could vote for Congress, president, and other offices), but women and preachers or priests were not allowed to serve as president or in Congress. Indians and Africans and those of African descent could not be citizens.

The president lived in different towns during the life of the Republic, as the capital was relocated, especially during and immediately after the Texas Revolution. Washington-on-the-Brazos was Texas&#x27; first capital in 1836 (provisional), followed quickly by Harrisburg 1836 (provisional), Galveston 1836 (provisional), Velasco 1836 (provisional), Columbia 1836–37, Houston, 1837–39, and finally Austin, the modern capital, 1839–46.

The position was abolished with the annexation of Texas, largely due to President Anson Jones, who received the nickname &quot;The architect of Annexation&quot; and served only one year and three months. The amount of power wielded by occupants of the office varied tremendously during the nine years of Texas&#x27; independence. Particularly in the beginning, there was a larger military need than in the 1840s, and the president therefore had considerably more power and influence than during years of relative peace. No record is known, however, of any president violating or changing the Texas Constitution.

As the United States and other countries such as France recognized Texan independence, presidential power functioned without interference from the outside world, although the Republic generally allied itself informally with the United States. Several presidents supported annexation of the republic by the United States, with direct admission as a state.

Under the Constitution the vice president was to succeed the president in the event of the latter&#x27;s death, resignation or removal by impeachment, but this never happened. The vice president was also the president of the Senate, and had a casting vote in the event of a tie.

==Oath of office==
The oath or affirmation of office for the president was established in the Constitution of the Republic of Texas and was mandatory for a president &#x27;before entering upon the duties&#x27; of the office. The wording, very similar to that of the United States&#x27; version, was prescribed by Article VI of the Constitution, as follows:

<text>T+E is a Canadian English language cable television specialty channel owned by Blue Ant Media. The channel primarily broadcasts entertainment programming, including docu-series and dramas related to the supernatural and paranormal.

This channel was originally established in 2001 as CTV Travel by its original owner Bell Globemedia as an offshoot of CTV Television Network with its programming devoted to travel and adventure. After a number of numerous ownership changes throughout the years, the channel was renamed to its current name in 2018 and adopted its current format.

==History==
===Under CTV (2000–2010)===
On November 24, 2000, a general partnership consisting of BCE Media Inc./Groupe TVA Inc. (owning 51%) and CTV Television Inc. (owning 49%) were granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch &quot;Travel TV&quot;, described as a &quot;national English-language Category 1 specialty television service... consisting exclusively of travel or travel-related programming. The service will explore the world within and beyond Canada’s borders. Programs will address various segments of the population and all types of travel, including those focusing on adventure, outdoor, sporting, cultural and historical interests.&quot;

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001, as CTV Travel under the sole ownership of CTV Television Inc (now a wholly-owned division of what is now Bell Media). Programming on the channel consisted of docu-series devoted to travel such as &quot;Jet Set&quot;, &quot;Exotic Islands&quot;, &quot;Places of Mystery&quot;, and &quot;Full Circle with Michael Palin&quot;.

On October 30, 2006, CTV Travel was renamed Travel + Escape (stylized as travel + escape until October 5, 2011) to give the channel, described by its owner, a new &quot;edgier&quot; look and feel to fit its new shift in programming the channel had already been making towards more character-driven and experienced-based travel series rather than the typical travelogue programs. New programs introduced to the channel included such series as &quot;Dead Famous&quot;, &quot;The Pleasure Zone&quot;, &quot;Hunt for Supertwister&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, and &quot;Mayhem at the Manor&quot;.

On June 8, 2010, it was announced the channel would be sold to Glassbox Television. The sale was approved by the CRTC on October 26 and closed shortly thereafter.

===Under Blue Ant Media (2011–present)===
On April 11, 2011, it was announced that Blue Ant Media would acquire a controlling interest in Glassbox Television. Blue Ant Media initially acquired a 29.9% stake in the company, with the option to expand their stake up to 75% which would give the company controlling interest.

On October 5, 2011, Glassbox Television announced that Travel + Escape would undergo a major overhaul on November 1, 2011. The overhaul included a new logo, on-air presentation, and a slate of new programming. On December 15, 2011, Travel + Escape launched a high definition feed.

In the Summer of 2012, Glassbox Television would be fully acquired by Blue Ant Media. Under their ownership, the channel would further shift its focus away from travel-based series to general-interest adventure and exploration based programming.,

In March 2018, Travel + Escape was renamed T+E, as part of a full shift to supernatural and paranormal programming.

<text>Bernard Sergent (; born 23 February 1946) is a French ancient historian and comparative mythologist. He is researcher of the CNRS and president of the Société de mythologie française.

== Publications ==
He has written a seminal work on Greek mythology entitled &quot;Homosexuality in Greek Myth&quot;, translated into English two years later by Beacon Press. In 1986, he followed up with a study covering early homosexuality in Europe, under the title of &quot;L&#x27;homosexualité initiatique dans l&#x27;Europe ancienne&quot; (Payot 1986), which has yet to be translated into English. The two studies have been published together, with a postface, as &quot;Homosexualité et initiation chez les peuples indo-européens&quot;.

In &quot;Genèse de L&#x27;Inde&quot;, he attacks the recent anti-invasionist reconstructions of early Indian history. Instead he defends the traditional hypothesis that the Indo-Aryans came into India in the 2nd millennium BC. According to Sergent, the Dravidian languages originated in Africa before reaching South Asia.

The book &quot;Les Indo-Européens - Histoire, langues, mythes&quot; is a general introduction to the Indo-European language family. Sergent associates the Indo-European language family with certain archaeological cultures in Southern Russian Steppes or Deshti Kipchak, and he reconstructs an Indo-European religion (relying on the method of Georges Dumézil).

In the monograph, &quot;Les trois fonctions indo-européennes en Grèce ancienne&quot;, vol. 1: &quot;De Mycènes aux Tragique&quot;, Sergent examines the employment of the Dumézilian tripartite system in Greek epic, lyric and dramatic poetry. In a second volume, which has not been published yet, he will continue this examination with Greek philosophy and religion.

His recent work, &quot;Celtes et Grecs&quot;, is dedicated to comparative Greek and Celtic mythology. In volume 1, &quot;Le livre de héros&quot; (Payot 1999 ), the Irish hero Cuchulainn is compared with the Greek heroes Achilleus, Bellerophon and Melanthius and the Irish epic Táin Bó Cúailnge with the Greek Iliad, which, according to Sergent, presuppose an Indo-European &quot;pre-Iliad&quot;. In volume 2, &quot;Le livre des dieux&quot;, Sergent argues that the Celtic and Greek pantheons derive from a common Indo-European inheritance.

<text>Donaldo Gugliermo &quot;Dennis&quot; Farina (February 29, 1944 – July 22, 2013) was an American stage and film actor. He worked as a Chicago police detective prior to his acting career. 

Often typecast as a mobster or police officer, he is known for roles such as FBI Agent Jack Crawford in &quot;Manhunter&quot;, mobster Jimmy Serrano in the comedy &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, Ray &quot;Bones&quot; Barboni in &quot;Get Shorty&quot;,
Cousin Avi in &quot;Snatch&quot;, and Walt Miller in &quot;New Girl&quot;. He starred on television as Lieutenant Mike Torello on &quot;Crime Story&quot; and as NYPD Detective Joe Fontana on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. He also played Miami mobster Albert Lombard in three episodes of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. From 2008 to 2010, he hosted and narrated the television program &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; on Spike TV. His last major television role was in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Luck&quot;, which premiered on January 29, 2012.

== Early life and police career ==
Farina was born on a Leap Day (February 29, 1944) in Chicago&#x27;s Old Town neighborhood, the fourth son and youngest of the seven children of Joseph and Yolanda Farina. Farina&#x27;s father, who was from Villalba, Sicily, was a Chicago-area doctor, and his mother a homemaker. They raised their children in a North Avenue home in Old Town, a working-class neighborhood with a broad ethnic mixture, with Italians and Germans the predominant ethnicities.

Before becoming an actor, Farina served three years in the United States Army during the Vietnam Era, followed by 18 years in the Chicago Police Department (1967 to 1985), during which he advanced from patrolman to detective.

== Acting career ==

=== Stage performances ===
In 1982, while still working as a detective, he made his stage debut in the Steppenwolf Theater Company production of &quot;A Prayer for My Daughter&quot;, directed by John Malkovich. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Richard Christianson criticized the production but said that Farina and other actors had &quot;moments that were riveting.&quot; 

Reviewing a 1983 production of David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Streamers&quot;, Christianson praised Farina&#x27;s performance as &quot;beautiful&quot; and said &quot;he is becoming a fine actor.&quot; In 1984, he appeared as Nick in a Chicago production of William Saroyan&#x27;s &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;. Ted Levine, who appeared with him in &quot;Crime Story&quot;, was in the cast.

=== Film and TV career ===
Farina began working for director Michael Mann as a police consultant, which led Mann to cast him in a small role in the 1981 film &quot;Thief&quot;. Farina worked with Mann again, as mobster Albert Lombard, in several episodes of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. He moonlighted as an actor in Chicago-based films (like &quot;Code of Silence&quot;, a 1985 Chuck Norris film) and theater before Mann chose him for his &quot;Crime Story&quot; series, which aired on NBC from 1986 to 1988. He later starred as the title character in &quot;Buddy Faro&quot;, a short-lived 1998 private detective series on CBS.

Farina played mob boss Jimmy Serrano in the comedy-crime film &quot;Midnight Run;&quot; and Ray &quot;Bones&quot; Barboni, a rival criminal to Chili Palmer, in &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. He played FBI Agent Jack Crawford in Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Manhunter&quot;, the first film to feature the character Hannibal Lecter. His other film appearances include Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;Striking Distance&quot;, &quot;Another Stakeout&quot;, &quot;Snatch&quot;, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Reindeer Games&quot;, &quot;Men of Respect&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble&quot; and &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. He played a baseball manager in &quot;Little Big League&quot; and a nemesis basketball coach in &quot;Eddie&quot;.

In a departure from his usual parts, he had a leading-man role, co-starring with Bette Midler, in the romantic comedy &quot;That Old Feeling&quot; (1997), directed by Carl Reiner.

Farina won an American Comedy Award for his performance in &quot;Get Shorty,&quot; and starred in the television sitcom &quot;In-Laws&quot; from 2002 until 2003. He appeared in the 2002 film &quot;Stealing Harvard&quot;, a comedy where he played a tough-talking, overprotective father-in-law. He had comic roles opposite Ed Harris and Helen Hunt in the HBO production of &quot;Empire Falls&quot; in 2005, and opposite Alan Rickman in the 2008 &quot;Bottle Shock&quot;.

Working as a voice-actor beginning in 2005, he provided the voice of aging boxer-turned-superhero Wildcat on &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. In 2013, he voiced the father of Daffy Duck&#x27;s girlfriend on &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, and played himself in a 2014 episode of the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot; called &quot;The Most Interesting Man in the World,&quot; aired posthumously, one of his final acting roles.

In 2004, producers of the television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; hired him as Detective Joe Fontana, following the death of longtime cast member Jerry Orbach. Farina stayed on the show for two seasons. In 2006, he left &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; for other projects, including the 2007 feature &quot;You Kill Me&quot; opposite Ben Kingsley and the 2008 &quot;What Happens in Vegas&quot; with Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher.

His role of Detective Lt. Mike Torello on &quot;Crime Story&quot; was as a Chicago police officer, assigned to the U.S. Justice Department.

He appeared in two television network miniseries based on Joe McGinniss&#x27;s true-crime books, &quot;Blind Faith&quot; (1990) and &quot;Cruel Doubt&quot; (1992). He made a rare western, portraying legendary lawman Charlie Siringo in a 1995 television movie, &quot;&quot;, a followup to the hit 1960s series.

In October 2008, he became the new host of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; when it returned to television with a new five-season, 175-episode run on Spike TV. Farina replaced Robert Stack, who had hosted the series for its prior 15-year run. This version featured re-edited segments from previous incarnations on NBC, CBS and Lifetime.

He played the title role in a 2011 independent film, &quot;The Last Rites of Joe May&quot;, written and directed by Joe Maggio, shot on location in Chicago. He was among the stars of a 2014 release, &quot;Authors Anonymous&quot;, playing a wannabe novelist with a fantasy of becoming another Tom Clancy.

Again on television, Farina co-starred in the 2012 HBO horse-race gambling series &quot;Luck&quot;, with Dustin Hoffman, directed by Michael Mann. He had a recurring guest role in 2013 in the television comedy series &quot;New Girl&quot;, though his character was killed off prior to his death.

Farina&#x27;s last film role was as an aging Italian playboy in a film version of the Off-Broadway musical &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot; co-starring Dominic Marsh, Nikki M. James and Jason Alexander. The film, released posthumously in 2014, was dedicated to his memory.

== Personal life ==

Farina was married to Patricia Farina from 1970 until their divorce in 1980. They had three sons, Dennis Jr., Michael and Joseph (who is also an actor); two granddaughters, Brianna and Olivia; and four grandsons, Michael, Tyler, Matthew and Eric. He lived with his longtime girlfriend Marianne Cahill in Chicago and Scottsdale, Arizona.

A lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, he played a Cubs fan in a 1988 revival of the successful 1977 Organic Theater Company stage play &quot;Bleacher Bums,&quot; written by and starring fellow Chicago actors Joe Mantegna and Dennis Franz.

Farina was arrested on May 11, 2008, for carrying a loaded .22-caliber pistol through Los Angeles International Airport security. He charged with carrying a concealed weapon, with bail set at $25,000. He claimed he had simply forgotten the weapon was still in his briefcase and never intended to take it on a plane. After police determined the weapon was unregistered, the charges were upgraded to a felony and bail was increased to $35,000. After reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation on July 17, 2008.

== Death ==
Farina died on July 22, 2013 at the age of 69, in a Scottsdale, Arizona hospital from a pulmonary embolism. He was buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

<text>Detroit was a 6-gun brig launched in 1798 as Adams in the United States. During the War of 1812 the British captured her, renamed her, and took her into the Provincial Marine. She served on Lake Erie during the War of 1812, giving the British control of the lake. The Americans briefly recaptured her, but she grounded and came under heavy fire. The Americans had to abandon her. The vessel was set afire and burnt.

==Description and construction==
Shortly after General Anthony Wayne took control of Detroit in 1796, a ship was ordered for construction by the United States Army. Construction of the 125-tons burthen vessel at the United States Shipyard on the River Rouge (at Baby Creek near what is now Woodmere Cemetery) began in 1797. Some accounts of the vessel indicate that the process of salting for preservation of the wood used in the construction was utilized aboard &quot;Adams&quot;. However, the process was done incorrectly and in a refit performed ten years after the brig&#x27;s construction, it was found that the salt had been packed too tightly and had not dissolved into the wood, and remained hard and dry between the frames. The United States Army intended to use &quot;Adams&quot; as a transport vessel carrying supplies between American outposts on the upper Great Lakes including Fort Mackinac on Lake Huron. The vessel was also used to carry private cargo.

==Service history==
By the beginning of the War of 1812, &quot;Adams&quot; was the only American government vessel of any kind on the upper Great Lakes. &quot;Adams&quot; was armed with six cannon and operated out of Detroit. On 16 August 1812, General William Hull surrendered Detroit after a siege by British forces. &quot;Adams&quot;, which had been at Detroit, was surrendered too, and was taken into Provincial Marine service and renamed &quot;Detroit&quot;. The brig was added to the Provincial Marine&#x27;s Lake Erie squadron. However, &quot;Detroit&quot;″s British service was short lived.

On 8 October, &quot;Detroit&quot;, with the North West Company&#x27;s brig , was anchored off Fort Erie. Lieutenant Jesse Elliott, commander of the United States Navy forces on Lake Erie, spotted the vessels and commanded a cutting out operation to capture both brigs. The American force of 100 departed Buffalo Creek and approached the British vessels in darkness. Elliott&#x27;s force successfully captured both vessels and the Americans made for safe harbour at Black Rock. &quot;Caledonia&quot; arrived safely, but &quot;Detroit&quot; ran aground on the southern tip of Squaw Island after the wind had died and the vessel became unmanageable, while under fire from British artillery. The British sent a force to retake the ship, but Elliott&#x27;s crew beat off the attack. In order to prevent the brig&#x27;s recapture, Elliott ordered the ship burned.

<doc id="809314" wikidata="Q2981889" url="?curid=809314" title="Motivic cohomology">
<text>Motivic cohomology is an invariant of algebraic varieties and of more general schemes. It is a type of cohomology related to motives and includes the Chow ring of algebraic cycles as a special case. Some of the deepest problems in algebraic geometry and number theory are attempts to understand motivic cohomology.

==Motivic homology and cohomology==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a scheme of finite type over a field &quot;k&quot;. A key goal of algebraic geometry is to compute the Chow groups of &quot;X&quot;, because they give strong information about all subvarieties of &quot;X&quot;. The Chow groups of &quot;X&quot; have some of the formal properties of Borel–Moore homology in topology, but some things are missing. For example, for a closed subscheme &quot;Z&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, there is an exact sequence of Chow groups, the localization sequence
:formula_1
whereas in topology this would be part of a long exact sequence.

This problem was resolved by generalizing Chow groups to a bigraded family of groups, (Borel–Moore) motivic homology groups (which were first called higher Chow groups by Bloch). Namely, for every scheme &quot;X&quot; of finite type over a field &quot;k&quot; and integers &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, we have an abelian group &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,Z(&quot;j&quot;)), with the usual Chow group being the special case
:formula_2
For a closed subscheme &quot;Z&quot; of a scheme &quot;X&quot;, there is a long exact localization sequence for motivic homology groups, ending with the localization sequence for Chow groups:
:formula_3

In fact, this is one of a family of four theories constructed by Voevodsky: motivic cohomology, motivic cohomology with compact support, Borel-Moore motivic homology (as above), and motivic homology with compact support. These theories have many of the formal properties of the corresponding theories in topology. For example, the motivic cohomology groups &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(X,Z(&quot;j&quot;)) form a bigraded ring for every scheme &quot;X&quot; of finite type over a field. When &quot;X&quot; is smooth of dimension &quot;n&quot; over &quot;k&quot;, there is a Poincare duality isomorphism
:formula_4
In particular, the Chow group &quot;CH&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of codimension-&quot;i&quot; cycles is isomorphic to &quot;H&quot;2&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,Z(&quot;i&quot;)) when &quot;X&quot; is smooth over &quot;k&quot;.

The motivic cohomology &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, Z(&quot;j&quot;)) of a smooth scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is the cohomology of &quot;X&quot; in the Zariski topology with coefficients in a certain complex of sheaves Z(j) on &quot;X&quot;. (Some properties are easier to prove using the Nisnevich topology, but this gives the same motivic cohomology groups.) For example, Z(j) is zero for &quot;j&quot; &lt; 0, Z(0) is the constant sheaf Z, and Z(1) is isomorphic in the derived category of &quot;X&quot; to &quot;G&quot;m[−1]. Here &quot;G&quot;m (the multiplicative group) denotes the sheaf of invertible regular functions, and the shift [−1] means that this sheaf is viewed as a complex in degree 1.

The four versions of motivic homology and cohomology can be defined with coefficients in any abelian group. The theories with different coefficients are related by the universal coefficient theorem, as in topology.

== Relations to other cohomology theories ==

===Relation to K-theory===

By Bloch, Lichtenbaum, Friedlander, Suslin, and Levine, there is a spectral sequence from motivic cohomology to algebraic K-theory for every smooth scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field, analogous to the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence in topology:
:formula_5
As in topology, the spectral sequence degenerates after tensoring with the rationals. For arbitrary schemes of finite type over a field (not necessarily smooth), there is an analogous spectral sequence from motivic homology to G-theory (the K-theory of coherent sheaves, rather than vector bundles).

===Relation to Milnor K-theory===

Motivic cohomology provides a rich invariant already for fields. (Note that a field &quot;k&quot; determines a scheme Spec(&quot;k&quot;), for which motivic cohomology is defined.) Although motivic cohomology &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;k&quot;, Z(&quot;j&quot;)) for fields &quot;k&quot; is far from understood in general, there is a description when &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot;:
:formula_6
where &quot;K&quot;&quot;j&quot;M(&quot;k&quot;) is the &quot;j&quot;th Milnor K-group of &quot;k&quot;. Since Milnor K-theory of a field is defined explicitly by generators and relations, this is a useful description of one piece of the motivic cohomology of &quot;k&quot;.

===Map to étale cohomology===

Let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth scheme over a field &quot;k&quot;, and let &quot;m&quot; be a positive integer which is invertible in &quot;k&quot;. Then there is a natural homomorphism (the cycle map) from motivic cohomology to étale cohomology:
:formula_7
where Z/&quot;m&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) on the right means the étale sheaf (μ&quot;m&quot;)⊗&quot;j&quot;, with μ&quot;m&quot; being the &quot;m&quot;th roots of unity. This generalizes the cycle map from the Chow ring of a smooth variety to étale cohomology.

A frequent goal in algebraic geometry or number theory is to compute motivic cohomology, whereas étale cohomology is often easier to understand. For example, if the base field &quot;k&quot; is the complex numbers, then étale cohomology coincides with singular cohomology (with finite coefficients). A powerful result proved by Voevodsky, known as the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjecture, says that many motivic cohomology groups are in fact isomorphic to étale cohomology groups. This is a consequence of the norm residue isomorphism theorem. Namely, the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjecture (Voevodsky&#x27;s theorem) says that for a smooth scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; and &quot;m&quot; a positive integer invertible in &quot;k&quot;, the cycle map
:formula_8
is an isomorphism for all &quot;j&quot; ≥ &quot;i&quot; and is injective for all &quot;j&quot; ≥ &quot;i&quot; − 1.

===Relation to motives===

For any field &quot;k&quot; and commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, Voevodsky defined an &quot;R&quot;-linear triangulated category called the derived category of motives over &quot;k&quot; with coefficients in &quot;R&quot;, DM(&quot;k&quot;; &quot;R&quot;). Each scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot; determines two objects in DM called the motive of &quot;X&quot;, M(&quot;X&quot;), and the compactly supported motive of &quot;X&quot;, Mc(&quot;X&quot;); the two are isomorphic if &quot;X&quot; is proper over &quot;k&quot;.

One basic point of the derived category of motives is that the four types of motivic homology and motivic cohomology all arise as sets of morphisms in this category. To describe this, first note that there are Tate motives &quot;R&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) in DM(&quot;k&quot;; &quot;R&quot;) for all integers &quot;j&quot;, such that the motive of projective space is a direct sum of Tate motives:
:formula_9
where &quot;M&quot; ↦ &quot;M&quot;[1] denotes the shift or &quot;translation functor&quot; in the triangulated category DM(&quot;k&quot;; &quot;R&quot;). In these terms, motivic cohomology (for example) is given by
:formula_10
for every scheme &quot;X&quot; of finite type over &quot;k&quot;.

When the coefficients &quot;R&quot; are the rational numbers, a modern version of a conjecture by Beilinson predicts that the subcategory of compact objects in DM(k; Q) is equivalent to the bounded derived category of an abelian category MM(&quot;k&quot;), the category of mixed motives over &quot;k&quot;. In particular, the conjecture would imply that motivic cohomology groups can be identified with Ext groups in the category of mixed motives. This is far from known. Concretely, Beilinson&#x27;s conjecture would imply the Beilinson-Soulé conjecture that &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(X,Q(&quot;j&quot;)) is zero for &quot;i&quot; &lt; 0, which is known only in a few cases.

Conversely, a variant of the Beilinson-Soulé conjecture, together with Grothendieck&#x27;s standard conjectures and Murre&#x27;s conjectures on Chow motives, would imply the existence of an abelian category &quot;MM&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) as the heart of a t-structure on &quot;DM&quot;(&quot;k&quot;; Q). More would be needed in order to identify Ext groups in &quot;MM&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) with motivic cohomology.

For &quot;k&quot; a subfield of the complex numbers, a candidate for the abelian category of mixed motives has been defined by Nori. If a category &quot;MM&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) with the expected properties exists (notably that the Betti realization functor from &quot;MM&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) to Q-vector spaces is faithful), then it must be equivalent to Nori&#x27;s category.

== Applications to arithmetic geometry ==

===Values of L-functions===

Let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth projective variety over a number field. The Bloch-Kato conjecture on values of L-functions predicts that the order of vanishing of an L-function of &quot;X&quot; at an integer point is equal to the rank of a suitable motivic cohomology group. This is one of the central problems of number theory, incorporating earlier conjectures by Deligne and Beilinson. The Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is a special case. More precisely, the conjecture predicts the leading coefficient of the L-function at an integer point in terms of regulators and a height pairing on motivic cohomology.

==History==

The first clear sign of a possible generalization from Chow groups to a more general motivic cohomology theory for algebraic varieties was Quillen&#x27;s definition and development of algebraic K-theory (1973), generalizing the Grothendieck group &quot;K&quot;0 of vector bundles. In the early 1980s, Beilinson and Soulé observed that Adams operations gave a splitting of algebraic K-theory tensored with the rationals; the summands are now called motivic cohomology (with rational coefficients). Beilinson and Lichtenbaum made influential conjectures predicting the existence and properties of motivic cohomology. Most but not all of their conjectures have now been proved.

Bloch&#x27;s definition of higher Chow groups (1986) was the first integral (as opposed to rational) definition of Borel-Moore motivic homology for quasi-projective varieties over a field &quot;k&quot; (and hence motivic cohomology, in the case of smooth varieties). The definition of higher Chow groups of &quot;X&quot; is a natural generalization of the definition of Chow groups, involving algebraic cycles on the product of &quot;X&quot; with affine space which meet a set of hyperplanes (viewed as the faces of a simplex) in the expected dimension.

In the 1990s, Voevodsky (building on his work with Suslin) defined the four types of motivic homology and motivic cohomology for smooth schemes over a perfect field, along with a triangulated category of motives inside a very robust framework of formula_11-homotopy theory. Different constructions were also given by Hanamura and Levine. These three triangulated categories of motives are now known to be equivalent, by work of Levine, Ivorra, and Bondarko.

Voevodsky also defined a motivic cohomology for singular varieties and used it in the proof of the Block-Kato conjecture. This has become known as cdh motivic cohomology, as it sits in an Atiyah–Hirzebruch style spectral sequence calculating homotopy-invariant algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory (the cdh-localization of algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory), rather than algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory itself.

<text>Dog Eat Dog is a Saturday night British game show devised by Howard Davidson, Sarah Edwards, Gail Sloan and Lynn Sutcliffe, that was hosted by Ulrika Jonsson and aired from 14 April 2001 to 2 November 2002 on BBC One.

==Format==
The programme started off by showing the six contestants at a training day where they underwent various tests to assess their strengths and weaknesses. The contestants talked about themselves and their fellow competitors. In the studio, the contestants voted on who they thought would fail a given challenge, which would either be a mental or physical one. The contestant who received the most votes would have to attempt the challenge. If they failed, they went to the &quot;Loser&#x27;s Bench&quot;, and if they won, they got to choose who went to that area of the studio, before reentering the game. They could only choose someone who voted for them to do the challenge.

In the case of a tied ballot; the person who was sent to the Loser&#x27;s Bench at the end of the previous challenge gets the tie break vote, and chooses between the tied contestants. If the tied vote happens on the opening round, then a contestant is selected at random; and that person gets to vote between the tied players. A player may not vote for themselves, unless they are the random tie-breaker in a tie and are part of that tie.

The last remaining contestant had the chance of winning the £10,000 prize, but had to face a general knowledge round against the other five competitors. If they could predict which three would get their questions wrong, they won the money; however, if the losers got three of their questions right, they split the prize between them, i.e. £2,000 each, and the overall winner of the show went home with nothing.

Some of the physical challenges carried over to the American version and the format was licensed internationally by BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC.

<text>Stephen Cassin (16 February 1783 – 29 August 1857) was an officer in the United States Navy during the First Barbary War and the War of 1812.

== Early life and military career ==
Born in Philadelphia, the son of naval officer John Cassin, Cassin entered the United States Navy as a midshipman in 1800. He was promoted to lieutenant, having distinguished himself in the war with Tripoli during the Second Barbary War on the . He also served in the West Indies Squadron against piracy.

=== War of 1812 and Congressional Gold Medal ===
In the War of 1812, he was promoted to the rank of post-captain and commanded the in the Battle of Lake Champlain and was awarded a gold medal by the United States Congress in commemoration of the victory.

Text of Congressional Gold Medal resolution:

:&quot;Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested to cause gold medals to be struck, emblematical of the action between the two squadrons, and to present them to Captain Macdonough and Captain Robert Henley, and also to Lieutenant Stephen Cassin, in such manner as may be most honorable to them; and that the President be further requested to present a silver medal, with suitable emblems and devices, to each of the commissioned officers of the navy and army serving on board, and a sword to each of the midshipmen and sailing masters, who so nobly distinguished themselves in that memorable conflict.&quot;

At the close of the war, Cassin commanded the Newport, Rhode Island Station, and after that the Washington Navy Yard for five years.

== Family ==
Cassin was married to Margaretta Abernethy and had thirteen children. His son John was a Naval officer too. His granddaughter was author Helen Lombard.

== Death and legacy ==
Captain Cassin died in Washington, D.C. He was buried in Washington, and reinterred in 1907 in Arlington National Cemetery.

Two ships have been named for him, both of which his granddaughter helped launch.
