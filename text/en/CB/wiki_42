<text>A jet pack, rocket belt, rocket pack or flight pack is a device worn as a backpack which uses jets to propel the wearer through the air. The concept has been present in science fiction for almost a century and the first working experimental devices were demonstrated in the 1960s.

Jet packs have been developed using a variety of mechanisms, but their uses are limited because of factors including the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, gravity, the low energy density of extreme fuels, and the human body not being suited to flight, and they are principally used for stunts.

A practical use for the jet pack has been in extra-vehicular activities for astronauts because of the weightlessness and lack of friction-creating atmosphere in orbit. The term jet suit is used for a system incorporating a jet pack and associated jets attached to the arms to increase manoeuvrability (e.g. the Daedalus Flight Pack).

==Overview==
In the most general terms, a jet pack is a wearable device which allows the user to fly by providing thrust. With the exception of use in a microgravity environment, this thrust must be upwards so as to overcome the force of gravity, and must be enough to overcome the weight of the user, the jet pack itself and its fuel. This necessarily requires the jet pack to continually push mass in a downwards direction.

While some designs have power and/or mass supplied from an external, ground-based source, untethered flight requires all of a flight&#x27;s fuel to be carried within the pack. This results in problems relating to the overall mass ratio, which limits the maximum flight time to a few minutes, rather than the sustained flight envisaged in science fiction.

==Liquid-fueled rocket pack==

===Andreyev: oxygen-and-methane, with wings===
The first pack design was developed in 1919 by the Russian inventor Alexander Fedorovich Andreev. The project was well regarded by Nikolai Rynin and technology historians Yu. V. Biryukov and S. V. Golotyuk. Later it was issued a patent but apparently was not built or tested. It was oxygen-and-methane-powered (likeliest a rocket) with wings each roughly long.

==Hydrogen peroxide–powered rocket packs==
A hydrogen peroxide–powered engine is based on the decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide. Nearly pure (90% in the Bell Rocket Belt) hydrogen peroxide is used. Pure hydrogen peroxide is relatively stable, but in contact with a catalyst (for example, silver) it decomposes into a mixture of superheated steam and oxygen in less than 1/10 millisecond, increasing in volume 5,000 times: 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2. The reaction is exothermic, i.e., accompanied by the liberation of much heat (about ), forming in this case a steam-gas mixture at . This hot gas is used exclusively as the reaction mass and is fed directly to one or more jet nozzles.

The great disadvantage is the limited operating time. The jet of steam and oxygen can provide significant thrust from advanced rockets, but the jet has a relatively low exhaust velocity and hence a poor specific impulse. Currently, such rocket belts can only fly for about 30 seconds (because of the limited amount of fuel the user can carry unassisted).

A more conventional bipropellant could more than double the specific impulse. However, although the exhaust gases from the peroxide-based engine are very hot, they are still significantly cooler than those generated by alternative propellants. Using a peroxide-based propellant greatly reduces the risk of a fire/explosion which would cause severe injury to the operator.

In contrast to, for example, turbojet engines, which mainly expel atmospheric air to produce thrust, rocket packs are far simpler to build than devices using turbojets. The classical rocket pack construction of Wendell Moore can be made under workshop conditions, given good engineering training and a high level of tool-making craftsmanship.

The main disadvantages of this type of rocket pack are:
* Short duration of flight (a maximum of around 30 seconds).
* The high expense of the peroxide propellant.
* The inherent dangers of flying below minimum parachute altitude, and hence without any safety equipment to protect the operator if there is an accident or malfunction.
* Safely learning how to fly it, given that there are no dual-control training versions.
* The sheer difficulty of manually flying such a device.
These circumstances limit the sphere of the application of rocket packs to spectacular public demonstration flights, i.e., stunts; for example, a flight was arranged in the course of the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, USA.

===Justin Capra&#x27;s flying backpack===
Justin Capră claimed that he invented a &quot;flying rucksack&quot; (Romanian: &quot;rucsac zburator&quot;) in 1956 in Romania, and, without arousing any apparent interest, informed the American Embassy of his idea. However it was tested by Henri Coandă, a Paratrooper who crashed it the first time but managed the second after he advised to change the fuel and improve on the design. In 1962 a backpack was created at Bell Laboratories, following Justin Capră&#x27;s prototype. The backpack is now displayed in a museum.

===Jump Belt===
In 1958, Garry Burdett and Alexander Bohr, Thiokol Corporation engineers, created a Jump Belt which they named Project Grasshopper. Thrust was created by high-pressure compressed nitrogen. Two small nozzles were affixed to the belt and directed vertically downward. The wearer of the belt could open a valve, letting out nitrogen from the gas cylinder through the nozzles, which tossed him upward to a height of . While leaning forward, it was possible with the aid of the jump belt&#x27;s thrust to run at . Later, Burdett and Bohr tested a hydrogen peroxide–powered version. The jump belt was demonstrated by a serviceman in action, but as no financing was forthcoming, there was no further testing.

===Aeropack===
In 1959 Aerojet General Corporation won a U.S. Army contract to devise a jet pack or rocket pack. At the start of 1960 Richard Peoples made his first tethered flight with his Aeropack.

===U.S. Army interest===
Transport studies of the U.S. Army Transportation Research Command (TRECOM) determined that personal jet devices could have diverse uses: for reconnaissance, crossing rivers, amphibious landing, accessing steep mountain slopes, overcoming minefields, tactical maneuvering, etc. The concept was named &quot;Small Rocket Lift Device&quot;, SRLD.

Within the framework of this concept, the administration concluded a contract with the Aerojet General company in 1959 to research the possibility of designing an SRLD suitable for army purposes. Aerojet came to the conclusion that the version with the engine running on hydrogen peroxide was most suitable. However, it soon became known to the military that engineer Wendell F. Moore of the Bell Aerosystems company had for several years been carrying out experiments to make a personal jet device. After becoming acquainted with his work, servicemen during August 1960 decided to commission Bell Aerosystems with developing an SRLD. Wendell Moore was appointed chief project engineer.

===Bell Textron Rocket Belt===

In 1960, the Bell Rocketbelt was presented to the public. The jet of gas was provided by a hydrogen peroxide–powered rocket, but the jet could also be powered by a turbojet engine, a ducted fan, or other kinds of rockets powered by solid fuel, liquid fuel or compressed gas (usually nitrogen).

This is the oldest known type of jet pack or rocket pack. One Bell Rocket Belt is on display at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, located near Dulles Airport.

===RB-2000 Rocket Belt===

This was a successor to the Bell Rocket Belt.

===Bell Pogo===

The Bell Pogo was a small rocket-powered platform that two people could ride on. Its design used features from the Bell Rocket Belt.

===Powerhouse Productions Rocketbelt===

More commonly known as &quot;The Rocketman&quot;, Powerhouse Productions, owned and operated by Kinnie Gibson, manufactures the 30-second flying Rocketbelt (June 1994) and organizes Rocketbelt performances. Since 1983 Powerhouse Productions has performed show flights in over 40 countries such as the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Super Bowls, the Rose Parade, Daytona 500, and the Michael Jackson Dangerous World Tour, as well as many television shows including &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;. Powerhouse Rocketbelt pilots include stuntman Kinnie Gibson and Dan Schlund.

===Jetpack International===
Jetpack International made three models of wingless jet packs. The company stated that the could fly 152 meters, using hydrogen peroxide fuel for its rocket engine. It was flown for 34 seconds in Central Park on the 9 April 2007 episode of the &quot;Today Show&quot; and sold for $150,000. Their H2O2 jet pack was for demonstration only, not for sale, but the company stated that it could fly 457 meters, also with the hydrogen peroxide rocket engine. The T-73 was expected to fly up to 18 meters using Jet-A fuel and a jet engine, and to sell for $200,000.

===Later technology===
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in 2014, Astro Teller, head of Google X (Google&#x27;s research laboratory), said they investigated jet packs but found them too inefficient to be practical, with fuel consumption as high as , and were as loud as a motorcycle, so they decided not to pursue developing them.

In recent years, the rocket pack has become popular among enthusiasts, and some have built them for themselves. The pack&#x27;s basic construction is rather simple, but its flying capability depends on two key parts: the gas generator, and the thrust control valve. The rocket packs being built today are largely based on the research and inventions of Wendell Moore at Bell Helicopter.

One of the largest stumbling blocks that would-be rocket pack builders have faced is the difficulty of obtaining concentrated hydrogen peroxide, which is no longer produced by many chemical companies. The few companies that produce high-concentration hydrogen peroxide only sell to large corporations or governments, forcing some amateurs and professionals to set up their own hydrogen peroxide distillation installations. High-concentration hydrogen peroxide for rocket belts was produced by Peroxide Propulsion (Gothenburg, Sweden) from 2004 to 2010, but after a serious accident Peroxide Propulsion stopped making it.

==Turbojet packs==
Packs with a turbojet engine are fueled with traditional kerosene-based jet fuel. They have higher efficiency, greater height and a duration of flight of many minutes, but they are complex in construction and very expensive. Only one working model of this pack was made; it underwent flight tests in the 1960s and at present it no longer flies. 
Jet packs and rocket packs have much better flight time on a tankful of fuel if they have wings like an aeroplane&#x27;s.

===Bell Jet Flying Belt: wingless===
In 1965 Bell Aerosystems concluded a new contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a jet pack with a turbojet engine. This project was called the &quot;Jet Flying Belt&quot;, or simply the &quot;Jet Belt&quot;. Wendell Moore and John K. Hulbert, a specialist in gas turbines, worked to design a new turbojet pack. Williams Research Corporation (now Williams International) in Walled Lake, Michigan, designed and built a new turbojet engine to Bell&#x27;s specifications in 1969. It was called the WR19, had a rated thrust of and weighed . The Jet Belt first flew free on 7 April 1969 at the Niagara Falls Municipal Airport. Pilot Robert Courter flew about in a circle at an altitude of , reaching a speed of . The following flights were longer, up to 5 minutes. Theoretically, this new pack could fly for 25 minutes at velocities up to .

In spite of successful tests, the U.S. Army lost interest. The pack was complex to maintain and too heavy. Landing with its weight on their back was hazardous to the pilot, and catastrophic loss of a turbine blade could have been lethal.

Thus, the Bell Jet Flying Belt remained an experimental model. On 29 May 1969, Wendell Moore died of complications from a heart attack he had suffered six months earlier, and work on the turbojet pack ended. Bell sold the sole version of the &quot;Bell pack&quot;, together with the patents and technical documentation, to Williams Research Corporation. This pack is now in the Williams International company museum.

The &quot;Jet Belt&quot; used a small turbofan engine which was mounted vertically, with its air intake downward. Intake air was divided into two flows. One flow went into the combustion chamber, the other flow bypassed the engine, then mixed with the hot turbine gases, cooling them and protecting the pilot from the high temperatures generated. In the upper part of the engine the exhaust was divided and entered two pipes which led to jet nozzles. The construction of the nozzles made it possible to move the jet to any side. Kerosene fuel was stored in tanks beside the engine. Control of the turbojet pack was similar to the rocket pack, but the pilot could not tilt the entire engine. Maneuvering was by deflecting the nozzles. By inclining levers, the pilot could move the jets of both nozzles forward, back, or sideways. The pilot rotated left/right by turning the left handle. The right handle governed the engine thrust. The jet engine was started with the aid of a powder cartridge. While testing this starter, a mobile starter on a special cart was used. There were instruments to control the power of the engine, and a portable radio to connect and transmit telemetry data to ground-based engineers. On top of the pack was a standard auxiliary landing parachute; it was effective only when opened at altitudes above . This engine was later the basis for the propulsion units of Tomahawk and other cruise missiles.

===Visa Parviainen&#x27;s jet-assisted wingsuit===
On 25 October 2005 in Lahti, Finland, Visa Parviainen jumped from a hot air balloon in a wingsuit with two small turbojet jet engines attached to his feet. Each turbojet provided approximately of thrust and ran on kerosene (Jet A-1) fuel. Parviainen apparently achieved approximately 30 seconds of horizontal flight with no noticeable loss of altitude.

===Yves Rossy&#x27;s jet wingpack===

Swiss ex-military and commercial pilot Yves Rossy developed and built a winged pack with rigid aeroplane-type carbon-fiber wings spanning about and four small kerosene-burning Jetcat P400 jet engines underneath; these engines are large versions of a type designed for model aeroplanes. He wears a heat-resistant suit similar to that of a firefighter or racing driver to protect him from the hot jet exhaust. Similarly, to further protect the wearer, the engines are modified by adding a carbon fiber heat shield extending the jet nozzle around the exhaust tail.

Rossy claims to be &quot;the first person to gain altitude and maintain a stable horizontal flight thanks to aerodynamic carbon foldable wings&quot;, which are folded by hinges at their midpoint. After being lifted to altitude by a plane, he ignites the engines just before he exits the plane with the wings folded. The wings unfold while in free-fall, and he then can fly horizontally for several minutes, landing with the help of a parachute. He achieves true controlled flight using his body and a hand throttle to maneuver.

Jet wingsuits use small turbojets, but differ from other aircraft in that the fuselage and flight control surfaces consist of a human.
The system is said by Rossy to be highly responsive and reactive in flight, to the point where he needs to closely control his head, arm and leg movements to avoid an uncontrolled spin. The engines on the wing must be aligned precisely during set-up, also to prevent instability. An electronic starter system ensures that all four engines ignite simultaneously. In the event of a spin, the wing unit can be detached from the pilot, and pilot and wing unit descend to Earth separately, each with a parachute.

Since 2007, Rossy has conducted some of his flight tests from a private airfield, Skydive Empuriabrava, in Empuriabrava (Girona, Costa Brava), Spain. Rossy&#x27;s jet pack was exhibited on 18 April 2008 on the opening day of the 35th Exhibition of Inventions at Geneva. Rossy and his sponsors spent over $190,000 to build the device. His first successful trial flight was on 24 June 2004 near Geneva, Switzerland. Rossy has made more than 30 powered flights since. In November 2006 he flew with a later version of his jet pack. On 14 May 2008 he made a successful 6-minute flight from the town of Bex near Lake Geneva. He exited a Pilatus Porter at with his jet pack. It was the first public demonstration before the world&#x27;s press. He made seemingly effortless loops from one side of the Rhone valley to the other and rose .

It has been claimed that the military was impressed and asked for prototypes for the powered wings, but that Rossy kindly refused the request stating that the device was only intended for aviation enthusiasts.

On 26 September 2008, Rossy successfully flew across the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, England, in 9 minutes, 7 seconds. His speed reached during the crossing and was moving at when he deployed the parachute. Since then he has—in several flights—managed to fly in a formation with three military jets and cross the Grand Canyon, but he failed to fly across the Strait of Gibraltar—he made an emergency landing in the water.

Rossy appeared in a February 2012 episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; (S18 E5) where he raced against a Skoda rally car driven by Toni Gardemeister with Richard Hammond as a passenger. The race started with the rally car launching down the rally course while Rossy and his support helicopter climbed to reach altitude, upon which he dropped and ignited his engines and followed the course to race the car. Periodical smoke dashes (such as those used by sky-writers or air force display teams) were used to track his progress. In the onboard footage of Rossy flying the tight and twisty course, one can see how he uses his body parts as control surfaces to perform various maneuvers.

On 13 October 2015 a show flight was performed in Dubai. Two jet packs operated by Rossy and Vince Reffet flew in formation with an Airbus A380 jetliner.

===Troy Hartman: jet pack and parafoil===

In 2008 Troy Hartman started designing a wingless jet pack with two turbojet motors strapped to his back; later he added a parafoil as a wing.

===jetpack: jet pack with rigid wings===
As of 2013 Fritz Unger in Germany is developing a jet pack called Skyflash with rigid wings about wingspan and two turbojets designed to run on diesel fuel. It is designed for takeoff from the ground using four undercarriage wheels on the front of his chest and abdomen.

===JetPack Aviation: wingless jet pack===

On 3 November 2015, Jetpack Aviation demonstrated the JB-9 in Upper New York Bay in front of the Statue of Liberty. The JB-9 carries of kerosene fuel that burns through two vectored thrust AMT Nike jet engines at a rate of per minute for up to ten minutes of flying time, depending on pilot weight. Weight of fuel is a consideration, but it is reported to start with per minute climb rate that doubles as the fuel burns off. While this model has been limited to , the prototype of the JB-10 is reported to fly at over .

This is a true jet pack: a backpack that provides jet-powered flight. Most of the volume is the fuel tank, with twin turbine jet engines gimbal-mounted on each side. The control system is identical to the Bell Rocket Belt: tilting the handgrips vectors the thrust – left-right &amp; forward-back – by moving the engines; twisting left hand moves two nozzle skirts for yaw; twisting the right hand counterclockwise increases throttle. Jetpack Aviation was started by Australian businessman David Mayman with the technical know-how coming from Nelson Tyler, prolific inventor of helicopter-mounted camera stabilizers and one of the engineers that worked on the Bell Rocketbelt that was used in the 1984 Olympics.

The company now makes two Jetpack models, the JB-10 and the JB-11. They are similar to the JB-9, with upgraded electronics. They both use kerosene/diesel turbojet engines. The JB-10 is designed with two large 200 lb. thrust engines and is described as having an 8-minute flight time, while the slightly longer duration JB-11 has a 10-minute flight time and uses eight smaller 90 lb. thrust engines.

===Flyboard Air===
Flyboard Air, invented by Franky Zapata, allows flight up to and can reach . It also has 10 minutes autonomy. Zapata participated with his invention during the 2019 Bastille Day military parade. Three weeks later, he crossed the English Channel with his device in 22 minutes, including a shipboard refueling midway.

===Daedalus Flight Pack===
This particular innovation saw two jets attached to the back of an exoskeleton, worn by the operator. At the same time, two additional jets were added to the arms, and could be moved with the arms to control movement. It was devised by Richard Browning of Gravity Industries. In September 2020 it was reported that the Great North Air Ambulance (GNAA) service was considering using this jet suit to enable paramedics to reach casualties in the mountainous Lake District, and by March 2022 the operational director of the GNAA, Andy Mawson, had been trained to fly and the service hoped to start using jet suits in summer 2022.

===iJETPACK Aeronautics: IJ6180 Jetsuit===
In 2021, Australian aerospace company, iJETPACK Aeronautics developed a six mini-turbojet wearable flight system (&quot;Jetsuit&quot;) producing up to 180 kg thrust distributed across three units on the arms and back. Its R&amp;D and flight operations are supported by NSW Government, Dainese, Specialist Helicopters and Australian Motorsport Innovation Precinct. iJETPACK&#x27;s founder, Jennie Bewes is a commercially licensed helicopter pilot that specialises in Safety &amp; Regulatory Compliance and a former corporate innovation leader known for introducing novel products and services such as the World&#x27;s first big-data insights tool. iJETPACK&#x27;s engineer, David &#x27;Dakka&#x27; Clarke is a former defence (RAAF) engineer who single-handedly built a hydrogen-peroxide fuelled &quot;Rocketbelt&quot; which he flew at Brisbane&#x27;s EKKA show in 2013, Royal Adelaide Show in 2014 and in China 2018.

==Government==
===Space===

Rocket packs can be useful for spacewalks. One example is the Manned Maneuvering Unit (or MMU), which weighed approximately 300 pounds and was affixed with two propellant tanks that supplied 24 small thrusters with 40 pounds of high-pressured gaseous nitrogen.  It was first used by astronauts Bruce McCandless and Bob Stewart in February 1984. While near Earth a jet pack has to produce a g-force of at least 1g (a smaller g-force, providing only some deviation from free fall is of little use here), for excursions outside a free falling spaceship, a small g-force providing a small deviation from free fall is useful. Hence much less delta-v is consumed per unit time, and not during the whole EVA. With only small amounts of thrust needed, safety and temperature are more manageable than in the atmosphere in Earth&#x27;s gravity field.

Nevertheless, it is currently worn to be used only in case of emergency: the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER).

==Hydroflight==
The 21st century has seen a new approach to jet packs where water is used as a high-density propulsion fluid. This requires a very large mass of fluid that makes a self-contained jet pack infeasible. Instead, this approach separates the engine, fuel and fluid supply from the pilot&#x27;s flying apparatus, using a long flexible hose to feed the water to the jet nozzle pack attached to the pilot&#x27;s body. These inventions are known as &quot;hydro jet packs&quot;, and successful designs have used jetski technology as the powerplant operating in a body of water (an ocean, lake, or pool) to provide the needed propulsion. Several hydro jet pack approaches have been successfully tested and put into production. Flow rate can be controlled by a throttle operator on the jetski, or by the pilot using a remote actuator.

Hydro jet packs can be operated below the water&#x27;s surface as well as above it. As of 2013, many hydro jet pack rental businesses are operating in various locations around the world.

===JetLev===

The JetLev was the first hydroflight jet pack on the market, and its makers were awarded the first patents, in 2008, for hydro jet packs. The JetLev has the appearance of a typical jet pack, with two nozzles on a backpack propelling the rider upwards. It has an umbilicus to the powering jetski that provides the water for the thrust used.

===Flyboard===

A Flyboard has water jets under each of the pilot&#x27;s feet. An optional feature is a lower-thrust water jet for each arm for greater control. The powerplant is a regular jetski. Development for this approach was started in the spring of 2011.

===Firefighters===

Firefighters in some parts of the world use jet packs which help them to fight fires close to the sea or a water body. The jet packs use water and there is no need for a fire truck or water tank.

==Home-made versions==
Episode 32 of &quot;MythBusters&quot; investigates the urban legend of an affordable jet pack or rocket pack that can be built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications were made by the &quot;MythBusters&quot; team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified engine mounting system. The jet pack produced by &quot;MythBusters&quot; had two ducted fans powered by ultralight-type piston engines. They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person off the ground, and was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 ultralight engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.

==In fiction==
The concept of jet packs appeared in popular culture, particularly science fiction, long before the technology became practical. Perhaps the first appearance was in pulp magazines. The 1896 novel &quot;The Country of the Pointed Firs&quot; mentions a &quot;fog-shaped&quot; man hovering low with &quot;the look of a pack on his back&quot; who &quot;flittered away out o&#x27; sight like a leaf the wind takes with it&quot;. The 1928 cover of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; featured a man flying with a jet pack.

When Republic Pictures planned to produce a superhero serial using its renowned &quot;flying man&quot; scenes as used in &quot;The Adventures of Captain Marvel&quot;, the character of Captain Marvel was tied up in litigation with the owners of the character of Superman. For its postwar superhero serial, Republic used a jet pack in &quot;King of the Rocket Men&quot;. The same stock special effects were used in other serials.

While several science fiction novels from the 1950s featured jet packs, it was not until the Bell Rocket Belt in the 1960s that the jet pack caught the imagination of the mainstream. Bell&#x27;s demonstration flights in the U.S. and other countries created significant public enthusiasm.

Jet packs were featured in two episodes (&quot;Turu the Terrible&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Monster&quot;), of the original &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; (1964–1965) animated television series, and are seen at the end of the closing credits.

In 1965 a Bell Rocket Belt appeared in the James Bond movie &quot;Thunderball&quot; when James Bond played by Sean Connery used a jet pack in the pre-title sequence to escape the villains and rendezvous with his French contact. The pack was piloted by Gordon Yaeger and Bill Suitor.

In the Irwin Allen television series &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1965–1968), a jet pack was used by members of the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; expedition on several occasions.

In 1966 the plot of the 21st book in the Rick Brant series titled &quot;Rocket Jumper&quot; was based on a hydrogen peroxide fueled jet pack. The book included a relatively detailed description of the design including the use of a platinum-metal screen catalyst.

In the 1973 film &quot;Sleeper&quot;, Woody Allen attempts to flee from the police of 2173 with a rocket pack, but he activates it before he can strap it on and it flies away without him.

The 1976 television series &quot;Ark II&quot; featured a jet pack called the Jet Jumper.

In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; original trilogy, the bounty hunter Boba Fett used a jet pack. In the prequel trilogy, Jango Fett also used a jet pack. &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; TV series from 2019 has multiple characters using jetpacks, as do various comics, video games, and other television shows in the franchise.
In the 1982–1995 comics book series, &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, the protagonist, Cliff Secord, acquires a stolen Cirrus X-3 military jet pack and uses it to become the eponymous superhero. It was later adapted into a motion picture in 1991.

In 1988 Cinemaware created the Amiga computer game &quot;Rocket Ranger&quot; which was ported to several other platforms of the era. In 1991 and 1992 Malibu Comics published a &quot;Rocket Ranger&quot; comic series closely based on the computer game.

The G.I. Joe action figure launch in 1982 included the JUMP (Jet Mobile Propulsion Unit) jet pack as an accessory. It was also featured prominently in the related &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; comic book series and cartoon.

Jet packs have been used by the title characters in several episodes of &quot;SWAT Kats&quot; cartoon series (1993–1994).

In the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise introduced in 1995, Buzz Lightyear uses a jet pack (which is made of plastic).

In the 1997 video game &quot;Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back&quot;, the titular character Crash operates a jet pack in two main levels: &quot;Rock It&quot; and &quot;Pack Attack&quot;. He also uses the jet pack in the final boss fight against Dr. Neo Cortex.

In &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; and its TV counterpart, Jimmy uses a jet pack (which is actually his backpack with built-in jet thrusters).

&quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; for the Nintendo GameCube, features Mario with an autonomous, water-powered jet pack named the Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device (or, F.L.U.D.D.) as a key element of navigation throughout the game; in addition to its default &quot;hover nozzle&quot;, which allows the titular character to change trajectory or hover in mid-air, it can be upgraded/customized to allow Mario to make an immediate jump boost (the &quot;rocket nozzle&quot;), or allow Mario to increase his speed exponentially while running or swimming (the &quot;turbo nozzle&quot;). The device has also appeared in various remakes and/or ports of the game, as well as in brief cameos or references in other Nintendo and Mario games.

In &quot;Totally Spies!&quot;, Sam, Clover and Alex use a jet pack (which resembles a woman&#x27;s backpack).

The tabletop wargame &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; makes heavy use of jetpacks in many of its armies. Distinctions are made between &quot;jump packs&quot;, which are used for assault infantry, and &quot;jetpacks&quot;, which are used for heavier units and allow for continuous flight.

Jet packs appear in the popular video game &quot;&quot; The jet pack also appears in the 2012 video game &quot;Halo 4&quot;, developed by 343 Industries.

Jet packs also appeared in other video games, including &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, &quot;Jetpack Joyride&quot;, &quot;BloodRayne&quot; (worn by Nazi troopers), &quot;Tribes&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot;, and the &quot;Pilotwings&quot; series, in which it is referred to as a &quot;Rocket Belt&quot;. It is also accessible in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. &quot;Fallout 4&quot; also has a jet pack power armor feature. &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot; added a jet pack called &quot;Thruster&quot; as a usable vehicle in a content update on December 12, 2017. Rocketeer is an Allied flying infantry unit in &quot;Red Alert 2&quot;.

Many science fiction movies have included jet packs, most notably, &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot;, &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;, &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;.

Running since 2013, &quot;Adventures in Jetpacks&quot; is a semi-regularly updated webcomic in which the cast of characters make regular use of jet packs.

<text>Dragon Island is a small privately owned island just outside Harataonga Bay, on the northeast coast of Great Barrier Island, located to the northeast of Auckland, in New Zealand. The island provides Harataonga Bay with shelter from easterly and southeasterly winds by blocking the bay from Pacific storms. The island is in relatively calm water, sheltered by the larger Rakitu Island to the north. It was once farmed but is now unpopulated and has reverted to scrub.

<doc id="813317" wikidata="Q1351584" url="?curid=813317" title="Glade Interface Designer">
<text>Glade Interface Designer is a graphical user interface builder for GTK, with additional components for GNOME. In its third version, Glade is programming language–independent, and does not produce code for events, but rather an XML file that is then used with an appropriate binding (such as GtkAda for use with the Ada programming language). 

Glade is free and open-source software distributed under the GNU General Public License. Glade&#x27;s development and maintenance ceased in 2022, with the final release on 10 August 2022.

==History and development==
The first Glade release, version 0.1, was made on 18 April 1998.

Glade 3 was released on 12 August 2006. According to the Glade Web site, the most noticeable differences for the end-user are:
* Undo and redo support in all operations.
* Support for multiple open projects.
* Removal of code generation.
* Contextual help system with Devhelp

Most of the difference is in the internals. Glade-3 is a complete rewrite, in order to take advantage of the new features of GTK+ 2 and the GObject system (Glade-3 was started when Glade-1 hadn&#x27;t yet been ported to GTK+ 2). Therefore, the Glade-3 codebase is smaller and allows new interesting things, including:
* Catalogs of &quot;pluggable&quot; widgets. This means that external libraries can provide their set of widgets at runtime and Glade will detect them. In fact, Glade 3 supports only standard GTK widgets; GNOME UI and DB widgets are provided separately.
* The various Glade Tools (palette, editor, etc.) are implemented as widgets. This allows for easier integration in like Anjuta, and makes it easier to change the Glade UI.

On 5 April 2011, two parallel installable stable Glade versions were released:
* Glade 3.8: That includes all support for GTK+ up till version 2.24. This version is to serve as a decent migration path for older projects migrating to GTK+ 3.0.
* Glade 3.10: That includes support only for widgets that are still included in GTK+ 3.0 and additionally drops support for Libglade.

On 11 June 2015 Glade 3.19.0 was released. It depends at least on GTK+ 3.16.0. Among many bug fixes this version is the first to support the widgets GtkStack, GtkHeaderBar and GtkSidebar.

==GtkBuilder==
&quot;GtkBuilder&quot; is the XML format that the Glade Interface Designer uses to save its forms. These documents can then be used in conjunction with the GtkBuilder object to instantiate the form using GTK. &quot;GladeXML&quot; is the XML format that was used with conjunction with libglade, which is now deprecated.

Glade Interface Designer automatically generates all the source code for a graphical control element.

The &quot;Gtk.Builder class&quot; allows user interfaces to be designed without writing code. The class describes the interface in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file and then loads the XML description at runtime and creating the objects automatically. The Glade Interface Designer allows creation of the user interface in a WYSIWYG manner. The description of the user interface is independent from the programming language being used.

==Code sketching==
Code sketchers are software applications that help a user create source code from a GladeXML file. Most code sketchers create source code which uses libglade and a GladeXML file to create the GUI. Some sketchers are able to create raw code that does not need the GladeXML file. The table below compares basic information about GladeXML code sketcher packages.

== Cambalache ==
Cambalache () is a free and open-source rapid application development (RAD) tool designed for creating user interfaces with GTK 4. It is designed as a successor to Glade, with a focus on supporting the GTK 4 library while maintaining compatibility with GTK 3. Cambalache is geared toward developers working within the GNOME ecosystem. Cambalache&#x27;s design emphasizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring separation between the UI components and the business logic of applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The UI editing workspace is driven by a separate process called Merengue which interfaces with Casilda, a Wayland compositor embedded in a GTK widget. This architectural choice improves stability by separating the user interface preview from the main application. This separation enables the system to handle different GTK versions efficiently, ensuring the rendered UI accurately mirrors the application&#x27;s appearance and behavior.

<doc id="813324" wikidata="Q306762" url="?curid=813324" title="Abbott Lawrence">
<text>Abbott Lawrence (December 16, 1792, Groton, Massachusetts – August 18, 1855) was an American businessman, politician, and philanthropist. He was among the group of industrialists that founded a settlement on the Merrimack River that would later be named for him, Lawrence, Massachusetts.

==Early life and education==
Lawrence was born on December 16, 1792, in Groton, Massachusetts, the son of American Revolutionary War officer Samuel Lawrence. He attended Groton Academy, now known as the Lawrence Academy, in Groton.

==Career==
Upon his graduation in 1808, Lawrence became an apprentice to his brother, Amos, as chief clerk in his brother&#x27;s firm. On the conclusion of his apprenticeship, in 1814, the Lawrences formed a partnership, specializing in imports from Britain and China, and later expanded their interests to textile manufacturing. Initially called A. &amp; A. Lawrence, the firm later was named A. &amp; A. Lawrence and Co. It continued until Amos&#x27;s death, and became the greatest wholesale mercantile house in the United States. It was successful even in the hard times of 1812–1815. In 1818, A. &amp;. A Lawrence purchased 50 shares of the Suffolk Bank, a clearinghouse bank on State Street in Boston.

The firm did much for the establishment of the cotton textile industry in New England. In 1830, it came to the aid of financially distressed mills of Lowell, Massachusetts. In that year, the Suffolk, Tremont and Lawrence companies were established in Lowell, and Luther Lawrence, the eldest brother, represented the firm&#x27;s interests there. When Amos retired from the business in 1831 due to ill health, Abbott became head of the firm. In 1845–1847, the firm established and built up Lawrence, Massachusetts, named in honour of Abbott, who was a director of the Essex Company, which controlled the water power of Lawrence, and later was president of the Atlantic Cotton Mills and Pacific Mill] there. The Lawrence brothers were among the founders of New England&#x27;s influential textile industry.

In 1819, Abbott Lawrence married Katherine Bigelow, the daughter of Timothy Bigelow and sister of John P. Bigelow. Their daughter, Katherine Bigelow Lawrence, married Augustus Lowell on June 1, 1854.

In the 1820s, Lawrence became a prominent public figure, including as a vocal supporter of railroad construction for economic benefit. He was an ardent protectionist, and represented Massachusetts at the Harrisburg protectionist convention in 1827. Lawrence was highly influential among Massachusetts Whigs. In 1834, he was elected US Representative as a Whig, serving in the 24th Congress. He did not seek re-election in 1836, but was elected again in 1838, serving in the 26th Congress. In 1840, he took an active part in the successful presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison. In 1842, he was appointed commissioner to settle the Northeastern Boundary Dispute between Canada and the United States. In 1844, he supported the campaign of Henry Clay and was a presidential elector. Lawrence was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1846, and subsequently was also elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1847.

In 1848, Lawrence was an unsuccessful candidate for party nomination as vice president on the Whig ticket, headed by Zachary Taylor. After Taylor&#x27;s presidential victory, he offered Lawrence a choice of positions in the administration. Lawrence rejected a cabinet appointment, and chose the post of minister to Great Britain. He was involved in the negotiations of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, and resigned in October 1852. He returned to the United States to join the 1852 presidential campaign of Gen. Winfield Scott. However, he grew dissatisfied with the Whig stand on slavery, and abandoned the party.

Lawrence was active in Boston&#x27;s Unitarian Church and donated money to various causes. He supported Lawrence Academy, affordable housing in Boston, and the Boston Public Library. He also provided $50,000 to establish the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard College, and provided a similar sum in his will for the School. He died in Boston on August 18, 1855, aged 62, and was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

His differenced coat of arms, &quot;Argent, a cross raguly gules, on a chief gules a leopard or&quot;, became well-known though its 1887 publication as the second of three frontispiece illustrations in &quot;American Heraldica&quot;, with explication of the original family coat of arms, &quot;Argent, a cross raguly gules, on a chief gules three leopard heads or&quot;, within the tome on page 33.

<text>The Riverfront Times (RFT) was a free progressive weekly newspaper in St. Louis, Missouri, that consisted of local politics, music, arts, and dining news in the print edition, and daily updates to blogs and photo galleries on its website. the &quot;Riverfront Times&quot; had an ABC-audited weekly circulation of 81,276 copies.

==History==
The paper was founded in 1977 by Ray Hartmann who, along with co-owner Mark Vittert, sold the newspaper in 1998 to New Times Media (later known, following a 2006 merger, as Village Voice Media). In September 2012, Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan and Jeff Mars agreed to purchase Village Voice Media&#x27;s papers and associated web properties from its founders and formed Voice Media Group. In 2015, Euclid Media Group acquired the &quot;Times&quot; from Voice Media Group.

The paper has received more than three dozen awards from the Missouri Press Association, along with the group&#x27;s Gold Cup. The paper and website also currently feature a weekly syndicated column by relationship and sex advice writer Dan Savage. In the past, the paper carried Chuck Sheppard&#x27;s News of the Weird column. Former journalists that wrote for the paper include Suzanne Langlois, who won the 1994 Con Lee Kelliher award for distinguished achievement.

In June 2019, editor-in-chief Sarah Fenske announced her departure after being selected to host &quot;St. Louis on the Air&quot; on St. Louis Public Radio. News editor Doyle Murphy was selected as interim editor-in-chief. Murphy served as editor-in-chief until he announced in the February 9, 2022, edition that he would be leaving the paper to work for St. Louis Public Radio. Ben Westhoff, the executive editor of Euclid Media Group, served as interim editor-in-chief following Murphy&#x27;s resignation, but announced on February 24, 2022, that Rosalind Early, who was then serving as deputy managing editor for &quot;Washington Magazine&quot; at Washington University in St. Louis, would be the paper&#x27;s next editor in chief, starting in March.

In August 2023, Euclid Media Group dissolved and the newspaper was sold to Chris Keating, operating under the name Big Lou Holdings LLC. The paper was sold again in May 2024 to an unnamed buyer and all staff were laid off.

<text>In economics, market clearing is the process by which, in an economic market, the supply of whatever is traded is equated to the demand so that there is no excess supply or demand, ensuring that there is neither a surplus nor a shortage. The new classical economics assumes that in any given market, assuming that all buyers and sellers have access to information and that there is no &quot;friction&quot; impeding price changes, prices &quot;constantly&quot; adjust up or down to ensure market clearing.

==Mechanism and examples==
A market-clearing price is the price of a good or service at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, also called the equilibrium price. The theory claims that markets tend to move toward this price. Supply is fixed for a one-time sale of goods, so the market-clearing price is simply the maximum price at which all items can be sold. In a market where goods are produced and sold on an ongoing basis, the theory predicts that the market will move toward a price where the quantity supplied in a broad period of time will equal the quantity demanded. This might be measured over a week, month, or year to smooth out irregularities caused by manufacturing batches and delivery schedules; some sellers may maintain inventory buffers to ensure that products are always available for retail sale and to smooth out irregularities caused by manufacturing and delivery schedules, others employ Just-in-time manufacturing to increase profits in normal operations with the trade-off being greater disruption when irregularities do inevitably occur (eg. drastic market fluctuations, natural disasters, pandemics, power outages, etc...).

The market clears when the price reaches a point where demand and supply are in equilibrium, enabling individuals to buy or sell whatever they desire at that cost. When supply and demand are equal, a market clearing takes place. The market must experience a shortage or a surplus to reach this state. A shortage indicates that buyers are interested in purchasing something, but need help to afford to do so at current prices. Conversely, a surplus occurs when there is an excess product beyond the quantity that buyers are willing to purchase at current prices. New classical economics does not assume perfect information in the short run, but markets may approach efficient outcomes as information is discovered.

If the sale price exceeds the market-clearing price, supply will exceed demand, and a surplus inventory will build up over the long run. If the sale price is lower than the market-clearing price, then demand will exceed supply, and in the long run, shortages will result, where buyers sometimes find no products for sale at any price.

The market-clearing theory states that prices in a free market tend towards equilibrium, where the quantity of goods or services supplied equals the quantity demanded. The theory assumes that prices adjust quickly to any changes in supply or demand, meaning that markets can reach equilibrium instantaneously. For example, consider a scenario where a community experiences an earthquake that destroys all houses and apartments. The sudden demand for new housing will create a temporary shortage of houses and apartments in the market. However, if prices are free to change, construction companies will build new houses in the short run, while new companies will enter the house and apartment construction market in the longer run. As a result, the housing supply will increase, eventually reaching a point where it equals the new demand. This adjustment mechanism clears the shortage from the market, establishing a new equilibrium where the market is in balance. This adjustment process is critical in ensuring that markets operate efficiently, promoting economic growth and stability. This increase in production brings supply into harmony with the new demand. The adjustment mechanism has cleared the shortage from the market and established a new equilibrium. A similar mechanism is believed to operate when there is a market surplus (glut), where prices fall until all the excess supply is sold. An example of excess supply is Christmas decorations that are still in stores several days after Christmas; the stores that still have boxes of decorations view these products as excess supply, so prices are discounted until shoppers buy all the decorations (to keep them until next Christmas).

==History and non-ideal behavior==
For 150 years (from approximately 1785 to 1935), most economists took the smooth operation of this market-clearing mechanism as inevitable and inviolable, based mainly on belief in Say&#x27;s law. But the Great Depression of the 1930s caused many economists, including John Maynard Keynes, to doubt their classical faith. If markets were supposed to clear, how could ruinously high unemployment rates persist for so many painful years? Was the market mechanism not supposed to eliminate such surpluses? In one interpretation, Keynes identified imperfections in the adjustment mechanism that, if present, could introduce rigidities and make prices sticky. In another interpretation, price adjustment could worsen matters, causing what Irving Fisher called &quot;debt deflation&quot;. Not all economists accept these theories. They attribute what appears to be imperfect clearing to factors like labor unions or government policy, thereby exonerating the clearing mechanism.

Most economists see the assumption of &quot;continuous&quot; market clearing as unrealistic. However, many see the concept of flexible prices as useful in the long-run analysis since prices are not stuck forever: market-clearing models describe the equilibrium economy gravitates towards. Therefore, many macro-economists feel that price flexibility is a reasonable assumption for studying long-run issues, such as growth in real GDP. Other economists argue that price adjustment may take so much time that the process of calibration may change the underlying conditions that determine long-run equilibrium. There may be path dependence, as when a long depression changes the nature of the &quot;full employment&quot; period that follows. 

In the short run (and possibly in the long run), markets may find a temporary equilibrium at a price and quantity that does not correspond with the long-term market-clearing balance. For example, in the theory of &quot;efficiency wages&quot;, a labor market can be in equilibrium above the market-clearing wage since each employer has the incentive to pay wages above market-clearing to motivate their employees. In this case, equilibrium wages (where there is no endogenous tendency for wages to change) would not be the same as market-clearing wages (where there is no classical unemployment).

==Flexibility in market clearing==
In an unregulated and perfect market both labor market wages and product market prices are fully flexible and can change rapidly based on supply and demand. This flexibility ensures that neither the product nor the labor markets will experience an oversupply. If there is an oversupply of a product, its price will drop until buyers find it affordable, and in the case of a labor surplus, wages will decrease until employers can offer jobs to all willing workers. This mechanism ensures that every market tends towards equilibrium where supply meets demand. For instance, retailers may offer discounts on old cell phones and computers to sell them quickly and balance their inventory. The flexible pricing allows more people to buy these items, achieving market equilibrium.

<doc id="813519" wikidata="Q1008072" url="?curid=813519" title="Home Run Derby">
<text>The Home Run Derby is an annual home run hitting competition in Major League Baseball (MLB) customarily held the day before the MLB All-Star Game, which places the contest on a Monday in July. In the context of the competition a &quot;home run&quot; consists of hitting a baseball in fair territory out of the playing field on the fly. It differs from a home run hit during legal gameplay in that the batter is not competing against a pitcher and a defensive team attempting to make an out. In the Home Run Derby, all pitches are purposefully thrown slowly and at a closer range than the official distance, usually by a coach behind a pitching screen. In addition, like batting practice, the batter remains in the batter&#x27;s box after each swing and does not run, nor circle the bases to score a run. In 2023, Julio Rodríguez set the single-round home run record with 41 homers, topping Vladimir Guerrero’s 40 home runs in 2019.

The batter also does not have to conform to the usual league uniform standards, and as all pitches are tossed in the strike zone without any threat of beanballs, may choose to wear a regular baseball cap instead of a batting helmet. As the event traditionally takes place at sunset where the sun is of no factor to the batter, they can choose to wear their hat casually and backwards.

Since the inaugural derby in 1985, the event has seen several rule changes, evolving from a short-outs-based competition to multiple rounds, and eventually a bracket-style timed event.

T-Mobile has been the title sponsor of the Home Run Derby since 2021.

==History==

The inspiration for the event was a 1960 TV series called &quot;Home Run Derby&quot;. The televised event included baseball legends Hank Aaron, Mickey Mantle, and Willie Mays. The show ran for 26 episodes with the winner receiving $2,000.

The event has grown significantly from its roots in the 1980s, when it was not televised. Prior to 1991, the Home Run Derby was structured as a two-inning event with each player receiving five outs per inning, allowing for the possibility of ties. It is now one of the most-watched events broadcast on ESPN.

In 2000, a &quot;match play&quot;-style format was instituted for the second round. The player with the most home runs in the first round faced the player with the least among the four qualifying players, as did the players with the second- and third-most totals. The contestant who won each matchup advanced to the finals. This format was discontinued after the 2003 competition.

The field of players selected currently consists of four American League players and four National League players. The first Derby in 1985 featured five from each league, and the 1986 and 1987 events featured three and two players from each league, respectively. In 1996, the field was again expanded to ten players, with five from each league (though in 1997, the AL had six contestants to the NL&#x27;s four).

In 2000, the field reverted to the current four-player-per-league format. The only exception was in 2005, when Major League Baseball changed the selection criteria so that eight players represented their home countries instead of their respective leagues. The change was believed to be in promotion of the inaugural World Baseball Classic, played in March 2006. In 2006, the selection of four players from each league resumed. In 2011, the format was revised so that team captains selected the individual sides.

For the first time in Derby history, Shohei Ohtani became both the first pitcher and the first Japanese player to participate in 2021.

Some notable performances in the Derby include Bobby Abreu in 2005, who won the Derby with a then-record 41 homers, including a then-record 24 in the first round. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. broke the first-round record in 2019 with 29 home runs. He broke that record in the following round, hitting 40 home runs in 2 tiebreakers. The previous overall record was set in 2016 by Giancarlo Stanton, who finished with a total of 61 home runs, defeating Todd Frazier in the final round. The current overall record is held by Guerrero Jr. at a mark of 91, set in 2019. Only three participants, Yoenis Céspedes, Stanton, and Pete Alonso, have won the Home Run Derby without being selected to the All-Star Game. Alonso broke Guerrero&#x27;s first-round record in 2021 with 35 homers on his way to his second straight Derby Title (the first being in 2019 with a final round win over Guerrero).

With his win in 2023, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. joined his father Vladimir Guerrero (the 2007 winner) as the first father-son duo to win the Derby.

==Overview==

===Format===
Eight players duel in a home run challenge.

====1985–1990====
In the early years of the Home Run Derby, 4–10 players from both the AL and NL were selected to participate. Each player was given two &quot;innings&quot; to hit as many home runs as possible before reaching five outs. For the derby, an out is defined as any swing that is not a home run. The winner of the contest was the player with the most total home runs in the two innings.

====1991–2005====
Beginning in 1991, the format changed to a 3-round contest. From 1991 to 2006, 8–10 players were selected and hit as many home runs as possible before reaching 10 outs in each round. The tally reset for each round, with the top four advancing to the second round, and the top two advancing to the final.

In honor of the World Baseball Classic, the 2005 contest featured eight players from different countries. The format remained the same.

====2006–2013====
The format changed slightly in 2006. Instead of the tally resetting for each round, it was only reset before the final round. Therefore, the players with the four highest totals after Round 1 advanced to Round 2, and the players with the two highest sums of Round 1 and 2 advanced to the finals.

====2014====
The Home Run Derby format was changed significantly in 2014, as MLB sought to speed up the contest and increase the drama. In the new bracket format, five players from each league faced the other players in their league in Round 1, with each players having seven &quot;outs&quot;. The player in each league with the highest Round 1 total received a second-round bye, and the players with the second- and third-highest Round 1 totals from each league faced off. The Round 2 winner from each league faced the Round 1 winner, and the Round 3 winner crowned the league winner. The final featured the winner of each league. Each round stands alone, with the score reset for each round. Ties in any round are broken by a 3-swing swing-off. If the players remain tied, the players engage in a sudden-death swing-off until one player homers.

====2015–2019, 2021–2023====
The format was changed once again in 2015. The most significant change was the elimination of &quot;outs&quot;, which was replaced by a time limit. Eight players are seeded based on their season home run totals and are given five minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. The winner of each head-to-head matchup advances, until a final winner is determined. If a tie occurs in any match-up, two sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 1-minute swing-off decides the winner; thereafter, multiple swingoffs of 3 swings until a winner is determined. Further, a player can get &quot;bonus time&quot; in the last minute of each round. During that time, the clock would stop for each home run, and would not restart until a swing does not result in a home run. Additional bonus time could be earned for distance. Players who hit at least two home runs measuring at least are given an extra minute of bonus time. An additional 30 seconds of bonus time is granted if at least one home run measures over .

Weather concerns in 2015 led to a reduction in time from five minutes per round to four minutes. The clock was not stopped in the final minute, and one minute of bonus time was granted only for hitting two home runs of at least .

The four-minute round length was made permanent in 2016, while the minute of bonus time was reduced to 30 seconds and required two home runs of at least . The additional time was removed. Each batter is allowed one time-out during each round, and two in the finals.

For 2017 and 2018, the first tie-breaker was increased from a 1-minute swing off to minutes. However, it was not needed in either of these years. The swing-off reverted to one minute in 2019, the first year in which it was used.

In 2021, the time limit was changed to three minutes plus a bonus of thirty seconds, with an additional thirty seconds of bonus time (for a total of one minute) added if a player hit a home run over 475 feet during regulation. In case of a tie, the contestants get one additional minute. If there still is a tie, each contestant gets three swings and repeats on ties thereafter. In the final round, the finalists get two minutes.

In 2022, the additional bonus time requirements reverted back to two home runs of at least 440 feet. Separate from the regular home run derby, if the 2022 All-Star Game itself had been tied after nine innings, a second home run derby would have been held to determine the winner. This derby would have been under somewhat different rules. It would not be timed, and each manager would pick three players to make three swings each to hit as many home runs as possible. If the tie persisted, extra players would have had triple-swing rounds until one team outslugged the other, with the winner getting a run and hit credited. A similar format would have been used in 2023 if the All-Star Game was tied after nine innings.

====Since 2024====
The format was revised prior to the 2024 event. The first round has reverted back to an open round, where the top four competitors advance. They now have three minutes, or 40 pitches, to hit as many home runs as possible. During this run, the hitters are entitled to one 30-second timeout. After their initial run ends, the hitters go into a new, un-timed &quot;bonus period&quot;, where they attempt to hit as many home runs as possible before making three outs (any swing that is not a home run). During this period, if a competitor hits a home run that travels over , they earn an additional out to work with. Ties are broken by the distance of the longest home run; otherwise, if both players tie, a one-minute playoff, and if needed, multiple three-swing rounds to decide it.

The second round is a bracket-style round, where the competitors are seeded based on their performance in the previous round. The winners of their respective head-to-head matchup advance to the finals. The rules for the round remain the same, with the tiebreaker rules from the previous format remaining as well. 

The final round remains largely the same, except for the time limit reducing to two minutes and the pitch limit reducing to 27 pitches. Whoever hits the most home runs in the round is declared champion; otherwise, players go into a one-minute playoff, and if needed, multiple three-swing rounds to decide it.

===Gold balls===
From 2005 to 2013, a gold ball has been used once a player reaches nine outs (in 2014 when the T-Mobile Ball came into play, six; since 2015, during the final minute). If a batter hit a home run using the golden ball, Century 21 Real Estate and Major League Baseball would donate $21,000 (a reference to the &quot;21&quot; in &quot;Century 21&quot;) per home run to charity (MLB donated to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and Century 21 donated to Easter Seals). In both 2005 and 2006, $294,000 was raised for the charities, equaling fourteen golden ball home runs per year. State Farm continued this in 2007 as they designated $17,000 per home run (one dollar for each of State Farm&#x27;s agencies), to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In the 2007 event, fifteen golden balls were hit for a donation of $255,000, and ten ($170,000) were hit in the 2008 event. For 2009, State Farm added $5,000 for all non-Gold Ball homers, and $517,000 was collected. For 2010, the non-Gold Ball homer was reduced to $3,000 per home run and a total of $453,000 was collected. Since 2014 any homer hit off a magenta T-Mobile Ball resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile and MLB, to Team Rubicon.

==Television and radio coverage==
On July 11, 1988, the day before the Major League Baseball All-Star Game from Cincinnati, TBS televised the annual All-Star Gala from the Cincinnati Zoo. Larry King hosted the broadcast with Craig Sager and Pete Van Wieren handling interviews. The broadcast&#x27;s big draw would have been the Home Run Derby, which TBS intended on taping during the afternoon, and later airing it in prime time during the Gala coverage. Unfortunately, the derby and a skills competition were canceled due to rain.

The derby was first nationally televised by ESPN in 1993 on a same-day delayed basis, with the first live telecast in 1998. Although two hours are scheduled in programming listings for the telecast, it has rarely ever been contained to the timeslot and consistently runs three to four hours. Chris Berman has gained notoriety for his annual hosting duties on ESPN, including his catchphrase, &quot;Back back back...Gone!&quot;. Berman starts this phrase when the ball is hit, and does not say &quot;Gone!&quot; until the ball lands.

The 2008 Derby was the year&#x27;s most highly rated basic cable program.

Because of the game&#x27;s TV popularity, invited players have felt pressure to participate. Notably, Ken Griffey Jr. initially quietly declined to take part in 1998, partly due to ESPN scheduling the Mariners in their late Sunday game the night before. After a discussion with ESPN&#x27;s Joe Morgan and another with Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, Griffey changed his mind, and then won the Derby at Coors Field.

In Spanish, the event is televised on Spanish language network ESPN Deportes. An alternate broadcast featuring live Statcast analytics has been carried on ESPN2 since the 2019 edition.

ESPN Radio also carries the event annually.

<doc id="813627" wikidata="Q324944" url="?curid=813627" title="Philippe Sollers">
<text>Philippe Sollers (; born Philippe Joyaux; 28 November 1936 – 5 May 2023) was a French writer and critic. In 1960 he founded the &quot;avant garde&quot; literary journal &quot;Tel Quel&quot; (along with writer and art critic Marcelin Pleynet), which was published by Le Seuil and ran until 1982. Sollers then created the journal &quot;L&#x27;Infini&quot;, published first by Denoël, then by Gallimard with Sollers remaining as sole editor.

Sollers was at the heart of the period of intellectual fervour in the Paris of the 1960s and 1970s. He contributed to the publication of critics and thinkers such as Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, Louis Althusser, and Roland Barthes. Some of them were later described in his novel &quot;Femmes&quot; (1983), alongside other figures of French intellectualism active before and after May 1968.

His writings and approach to language were examined and praised by French critic Roland Barthes in his book &quot;Writer Sollers&quot;.

==Biography==
Sollers was born as Philippe Joyaux on 28 November 1936, in Talence, France. His family ran the local &quot;Société Joyaux Frères&quot;, the iron factory &quot;Recalt&quot; producing material for kitchens, metal constructions and machines for the aircraft manufacturer SNCASO under the German military administration in occupied France during World War II. His parents were Octave Joyaux and Marcelle Molinié. He moved to Paris in 1955 and studied at the Lycée privé Sainte-Geneviève of Versailles and at the ESSEC Business School.

Sollers married Julia Kristeva in 1967. He died on 5 May 2023, at the age of 86.

==Work==
Following his first novel, &quot;A Strange Solitude&quot; (1958), hailed by François Mauriac and Louis Aragon, Sollers began, with &quot;The Park&quot; (1961) the experiments in narrative form that would lead to &quot;Event&quot; (&quot;Drame&quot;, 1965) and &quot;Nombres&quot; (1968). Jacques Derrida analyzed these novels in his book &quot;Dissemination&quot;. Sollers then attempted to counter the high seriousness of &quot;Nombres&quot; in &quot;Lois&quot; (1972), which featured greater stylistic interest through the use of wordplay and a less formal style. The direction taken by &quot;Lois&quot; was developed through the heightened rhythmic intensity of non-punctuated texts such as &quot;Paradis&quot; (1981).

Sollers&#x27;s other novels include &quot;Women&quot; (1983), &quot;Portrait du joueur&quot; (1984), &quot;Le coeur absolu&quot; (1986), &quot;Watteau in Venice&quot; (1991), &quot;Studio&quot; (1997), &quot;Passion fixe&quot; (2000), and &quot;L&#x27;étoile des amants&quot; (2002), which introduced a degree of realism to his fiction, in that they make more explicit use of plot, character, and thematic development. They offer the reader a fictional study of the society in which he or she lives by reinterpreting, among other things, the roles of politics, media, sex, religion, and the arts.

==Controversies==
In 1990, following a televised disagreement between Canadian novelist Denise Bombardier and the French writer Gabriel Matzneff over Matzneff&#x27;s recently published memoir about his sexual relationships with young teenagers, a few days later, on the television channel France 3, Sollers referred to Bombardier as &quot;a badly fucked bitch&quot; (&quot;connasse mal-baisée&quot;).

<doc id="813633" wikidata="Q7347918" url="?curid=813633" title="Robert N. C. Nix Jr.">
<text>Robert Nelson Cornelius Nix Jr. (July 13, 1928 – August 23, 2003) served as the chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from 1984 to 1996. Nix was the first African-American Chief Justice of any state&#x27;s highest court, and the first African American to be elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania. He served as a justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania for 24 years, 12 of which were as chief justice, and was a prominent figure in Pennsylvania law and public service for more than three decades.

==Personal life==
Nix was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 1928. He was the son of Robert N. C. Nix Sr., the first of Pennsylvania&#x27;s African American Representative in the United States Congress and a powerhouse among city Democrats. Nix&#x27;s grandfather was Nelson Cornelius Nix, who was born into slavery but eventually became a minister and an academic dean of South Carolina State College at Orangeburg.

Nix was a 1946 graduate of Central High School, where he graduated with the highest honors in his class; a 1950 graduate and valedictorian of Villanova University, where he received his A.B. degree; and a second-generation graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he received his Juris Doctor degree in 1953.
He was also a postgraduate of Temple University for Business Administration and Economics.

==Legal career==
After graduating from law school, Nix spent 2 years serving in the United States Army before becoming a Deputy Attorney General in 1956. After two years in the Attorney General&#x27;s Office he joined his father&#x27;s law firm, Nix, Rhodes and Nix, as a partner, where he gained a reputation as a civil rights advocate. During the 1960s, he represented United Neighbors, a citizens&#x27; group advocating improvements in a blighted section of West Philadelphia. He served as a member of the mayor&#x27;s advisory committee on civil rights in 1963, where he raised questions about racial discrimination in city government hiring, and pushed for action against slumlords. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Nix commented that unless the nation made a commitment to racial equality, it faced &quot;an internal conflagration that will reduce it to ashes.&quot;

He also defended Philadelphia Magistrate Earl Lane in a 1966 case with political and racial overtones. Lane was accused of collecting $2 to $20 fees for signing copies of charges that released people accused of crimes, a procedure that was supposed to be free or, if bail was required, cost a dollar. Nix unsuccessfully sought a new judge and a change of venue for the trial, contending that Lane, a former Pullman porter and Democratic committeeman, had been unfairly singled out for prosecution on charges far more minor than those the other magistrates faced. After Lane was convicted and sentenced to 11 to 23 months in prison, Nix said Lane was &quot;the first man in the history of the state charged with this crime&quot; and that at least 19 other magistrates did the same thing but had not been charged.

Nix served as a ward leader in Philadelphia while he was a lawyer.

==Judicial career==
In 1967 Nix was elected as a judge on the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. He was appointed an associate justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court by Governor Milton Shapp in 1971, and was elected the following year. He was the first African American elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania history. Of his election, Justice Nix said: &quot;[i]t shows that the people want ideas, that they are not interested in race, creed or color. I&#x27;m particularly impressed by the vote in the central counties. It is just unbelievable that a Philadelphia candidate won there. And a black man!&quot; He became chief justice in 1984, replacing former Chief Justice Samuel J. Roberts. He was the first African American state court Chief Justice in the United States. From 1991 to 1992 he served as President of the National Conference of Chief Justices.

On the high court, Justice Nix developed a reputation as a voice for individual rights. A champion of the broader rights accorded by the state constitution, Justice Nix led the court to interpret the Pennsylvania Constitution to ensure more individual rights than the U.S. Constitution, especially in the areas of search and seizure and sovereign immunity. He was also an early voice against prosecutors using their power to exclude African Americans from juries. Although generally considered a liberal, in 1977 he was the lone voice for upholding Pennsylvania&#x27;s death penalty statute.

During his time on the Supreme Court, Nix was honored with 12 honorary doctorates and membership on the board of trustees of the American Inns of Court and many universities. Pope John Paul II inducted Nix as a Commander Knight in the Order of St. Gregory the Great.

==Controversies==
Justice Nix was involved in several high-profile controversies. In 1966, when running for election as a judge on the Philadelphia court of common pleas, Nix was criticized for continuing to be on his father&#x27;s payroll as a congressional assistant, despite working as an attorney in private practice, and for collecting money each month from Congress in rent for his father&#x27;s use of space in Nix&#x27;s office. The rental agreement was dropped soon after.

In 1981 Justice Nix was retained for a second ten-year term in a controversial election. A public feud between Nix and Justice Rolf Larsen took on racial undertones when newspapers reported that Larsen allegedly threatened to publicize the fact that Justice Nix was black in an attempt to defeat him. Larsen was investigated and exonerated by a judicial board of inquiry, however, the disputes between the Justices continued. In 1992 Larsen was accused of improperly communicating with a trial judge about a case (Larsen was later found to have engaged in misconduct and publicly reprimanded). Larsen in turn filed court documents accusing Nix of similar conduct. Both the District and Appellate courts concluded in 1995 that Nix had, in fact, improperly intervened in the trial in question. After stepping down in 1996, Justice Nix said his difficulties with Larsen were &quot;regrettable, but we were able to eliminate that and restore confidence in the judicial system.&quot; Larsen was ultimately impeached and removed from office for unrelated misconduct.

==Retirement and death==
In 1996 Nix announced his retirement from the bench, two years prior to his mandatory retirement. In announcing his retirement, Nix said, &quot;It is time for me to walk away and smell the daisies.&quot; He indicated that he planned to travel and write, avocations he had put on hold.

On August 23, 2003, Nix died in Philadelphia, after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

The official biography of Justice Nix was published in 2010.

There is a mural honoring Nix and his father at 15th and Jefferson Streets in Philadelphia.

<text>Go-go dancers are dancers who are employed to entertain crowds at nightclubs or other venues where music is played. Go-go dancing originated in the early 1960s at the French bar Whisky a Gogo, located in the town of Juan-les-Pins. The bar&#x27;s name was taken from the French title of the Scottish comedy film &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;  The French bar then licensed its name to the West Hollywood rock club Whisky a Go Go, which opened in January 1964 and chose the name to reflect the already popular craze of go-go dancing. Many 1960s-era nightclub dancers wore short, fringed skirts and high boots which eventually came to be called go-go boots. Nightclub promoters in the mid‑1960s then conceived the idea of hiring women dressed in these outfits to entertain patrons.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;go-go&quot; derives from the phrase &quot;go-go-go&quot; for a high-energy person, and was influenced by the French expression &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;in abundance, galore&quot;, which is in turn derived from the ancient French word &quot;la gogue&quot; for &quot;joy, happiness&quot;. The term &quot;go-go dancer&quot; originated from the French bar Whisky a Gogo located in Juan-les-Pins, a seaside town near Cannes, which was among the first places in the world to replace live music with records selected by a disc jockey and to provide the spectacle of paid dancers known as go-go girls.

==In the 1960s==
On 19 June 1964, Carol Doda began go-go dancing topless at the Condor Club on Broadway and Columbus in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. She became the world&#x27;s most famous topless and bottomless go-go dancer, dancing at the Condor for 22 years. In Canada, in 1966, Bonny Rush was mentioned as the country&#x27;s first topless go-go dancer in the news media. In general, however, go-go dancers in the 1960s did not work topless.

In 1964 the Los Angeles–based club Whisky a Go Go began suspending go-go dancers above the audience in glass cages. Located on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, the club hired scantily clad dancers wearing knee-high vinyl go-go boots (or occasionally the Courrèges boots which inspired them) and mini skirts or mini flapper dresses. The club began to hire go-go dancers regularly in July 1965.

Go-go discotheques began to open across the United States. In 1967 an article in &quot;Newsweek&quot; estimated that there were 8000 go-go dancers working in the US, aged mostly between 18 and 21. The majority of go-go dancers in the New York metropolitan area were migrants from Brazil. Go-go dancing was generally performed to recorded music rather than a live band. The go-go dancers danced on tables, in cages, on dance floors or on small go-go stages. Their role was to entertain the audience and demonstrate dance moves. Many dancers hoped that go-go dancing would provide them a way into show business. Others simply earned money while travelling around the US as part of the counterculture of the 1960s. Earnings from go-go dancing in the mid-1960s were around $125–$200 per week.

In Germany, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, in an article on discotheque trends in April 1965, described the &quot;Scotch Kneipe&quot; and the &quot;Pussycat&quot; in Munich as the first discotheques in the country to feature go-go dancers performing in cages above the audience. In Canada in 1967, a club in Montreal&#x27;s York Hotel began to employ the city&#x27;s first go-go dancers. Other Montreal venues followed, including bars, hotels, taverns and strip clubs. The dancers initially wore pasties but over the years the amount of nudity shown increased.

===Television and media===
Go-go dancers were employed as background dancers accompanying performances (real or lip-synced) by rock and roll bands on teen music programs in the mid-1960s. &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; was a musical variety series that ran on NBC from 12 January 1965 – 29 August 1966. &quot;The Hullabaloo Dancers&quot;—a team of four men and six women—appeared on a regular basis. Another female dancer, model/actress Lada Edmund, Jr., was best known as the caged &quot;go-go girl&quot; dancer in the &quot;Hullabaloo A-Go-Go&quot; segment near the closing sequence of the show. Other dance TV shows during this period such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;Shindig!&quot; (16 September 1964 – 8 January 1966) also featured go-go dancers in cages. Sometimes these cages were made of clear plastic with lights strung inside of them; sometimes the lights were synchronized to go on and off with the music. &quot;Shivaree&quot; (syndicated, 1965–1966), another music show, usually put go-go dancers on scaffolding and on a platform behind the band which was performing. &quot;Beat-Club,&quot; a German show in the period, also used go-go dancers. Each show of the period had a particular method of bringing the go-go dancers into camera view.

British go-go dancer Sandy Sarjeant became popular performing on the ITV music show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;.

The US TV crime drama series &quot;Honey West&quot; (1965–1966) included an episode called &quot;The Princess and the Paupers&quot; which featured a go-go dancing sequence.

Go-go dancing became the subject of 1960s pop songs such as &quot;Little Miss Go-Go&quot; (1965) by Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys and &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot; (1965) by The Miracles.

==In gay clubs==

Many gay clubs had male go-go dancers, often called go-go boys, from 1965 to 1968, after which few gay clubs had go-go dancers. In the early 1980s New York&#x27;s Anvil club featured go-go dancers and drag shows. In 1988 go-go dancing again became fashionable at gay clubs (and has remained so ever since). Nowadays, gay male go-go dancers are a lot more popular and common in American culture, especially in bigger cities such as Los Angeles and New York. There are more gay go-go dancers than female go-go dancers in today&#x27;s club scene, a big turnaround from the 1960s.

==In the 1970s and after==
During the 1970s discotheques became less popular and few nightclubs employed go-go dancers. Opportunities for go-go dancing work mainly continued at strip clubs where the audience was all male. Most of the strip clubs in the 1970s abandoned traditional burlesque striptease in favour of live sex shows and go-go dancing which was performed topless or naked.

However, in the late 1970s, there was a nightclub at 128 West 45th Street (the same location where the Peppermint Lounge had been) in Manhattan, New York City, called &quot;G.G. Barnum&#x27;s Room&quot;, patronized largely by transgender women, that had male go-go dancers who danced on trapezes above a net over the dance floor.
In 1978, the Xenon night club in Manhattan became the first night club to provide go-go boxes for amateur go-go dancers to dance on.

During the 1980s go-go dancing continued in strip clubs and peep shows. Lawmakers in some jurisdictions passed regulations prohibiting nude dancing, requiring go-go dancers to wear pasties and a G-string. These laws were challenged under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution using the argument that naked go-go dancing qualifies as free speech.

Musical styles such as techno, house music and trance music appeared during the 1990s as part of underground rave culture. As these styles became mainstream, an increase in the use of go-go dancing accompanied their rise in popularity. Dancers performing to these musical styles began to appear at music festivals and nightclubs to encourage the crowd to dance.

Today, go-go dancing has also found an outlet in mass media. Horrorpops, a Danish band, is known for featuring go-go dancers in their live performances and their music videos. The music video for &quot;Horrorbeach&quot; was dedicated entirely to the band&#x27;s go-go dancers. Go-go dancers can be employed to enhance a band&#x27;s performance, or a DJ&#x27;s music mix.

In Russia, in the 2013 elections the Civilian Power party put forward four female go-go dancers as candidates for deputies.

American shows of the 1960s featured dancers that were highly trained, but many modern dancers are not always professional (for example some nightclubs in tourist areas in Magaluf or Ibiza). However, there are many companies that supply professionally trained dancers to nightclubs for podium work around the world.

==Holidays and celebrations==
Currently, the City of West Hollywood celebrates the history and culture of go-go dancing by hosting an annual &quot;Go-Go Boy Appreciation Day&quot; that includes a street festival and competition.

==Performance art dancers==
Go-go dancers that are hired to dance at night clubs, special parties, festivals, circuit parties or rave dances in bright, colorful costumes are called performance art dancers. Most often, go-go dancers are typically women who perform to entertain a crowd in public or at clubs and they often wear sexy clothing or printed clothes. Their costumes often include accessories such as glow sticks, light chasers, toy ray guns that light up, go-go shorts embedded with battery-operated fiber optic tubes in various colors, strings of battery-operated colored lights in plastic tubes, fire sticks, a musical instrument, or an animal (usually a snake). In the early to mid‑1980s, the performance art dancer John Sex, who performed with a python, played a role in making go-go dancing popular once again at gay and bisexual night clubs along with his life partner Sebastian Kwok.

<text>Vasily Vasilyevich Dokuchaev (; 1 March 1846 – 8 November 1903) was a Russian geologist and geographer who is credited with laying the foundations of soil science. The Ukrainian city of Dokuchaievsk is named after him.

== Overview ==
Vasily Vasilevich Dokuchaev is commonly regarded as the father of soil science, the study of soils in their natural setting. He developed soil science in Russia and was perhaps the first to conduct broad geographical investigations of different soil types. His contribution to science figuratively &quot;put soils on the map&quot;.

He introduced the idea that other variables could explain the geographical variations in soil type besides geological factors (parent material), such as climatic and topographic factors, and by the duration of pedogenesis (soil formation). He developed the very first soil classification, using these ideas as a starting point. His ideas were taken up by many soil scientists, including Hans Jenny.

Dokuchaev&#x27;s work on soil science produced a system of soil classification that described five factors for soil formation. He arrived at his theory after extensive field studies on Russian soils in 1883. His most famous work is &quot;Russian Chernozem&quot; (1883). As a result of Dokuchaev&#x27;s research, many Russian terms became part of the international soil science vocabulary (for example, chernozem, podsol, gley, solonets).

A crater on Mars is named after him, and the Dokuchaev Award, an equivalent of the Nobel Prize in the field of Soil Science, was instituted by the International Union of Soil Sciences in his honor.

== Quote ==
:&quot;The scientific basis of soil science as a natural science was established by the classical works of Dokuchaev. Previously, soil had been considered a product of physicochemical transformations of rocks, a dead substrate from which plants derive nutritious mineral elements. Soil and bedrock were in fact equated.&quot;

:&quot;Dokuchaev considers the soil as a natural body having its own genesis and its own history of development, a body with complex and multiform processes taking place within it. The soil is considered as different from bedrock. The latter becomes soil under the influence of a series of soil-formation factors (climate, vegetation, parent material, relief and age). According to him, soil should be called the &quot;daily&quot; or outward horizons of rocks regardless of the type; they are changed naturally by the common effect of water, air and various kinds of living and dead organisms.&quot;

== Authored works ==
Dokuchaev published in 1869-1901: 285 works, including 61 books and 4 maps.

<doc id="813752" wikidata="Q1183933" url="?curid=813752" title="Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad">
<text>The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, also known as the DL&amp;W or Lackawanna Railroad, was a U.S. Class 1 railroad that connected Buffalo, New York, and Hoboken, New Jersey, and by ferry with New York City, a distance of . The railroad was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1853, and created primarily to provide a means of transport of anthracite coal from the Coal Region in Northeast Pennsylvania to large coal markets in New York City. The railroad gradually expanded both east and west, and eventually linked Buffalo with New York City.

Like most coal-focused railroads in Northeastern Pennsylvania, including Lehigh Valley Railroad, New York, Ontario and Western Railroad, and the Lehigh &amp; New England Railroad, the DL&amp;W was profitable during the first half of the 20th century, but its margins were gradually hurt by declining Pennsylvania coal traffic, especially following the 1959 Knox Mine Disaster and competition from trucks following the expansion of the Interstate Highway System in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1960, the DL&amp;W merged with rival Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad that would be taken over by Conrail in 1976.

==History==
===Pre-DL&amp;W (1832–1853)===
Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad was first incorporated as Leggett&#x27;s Gap Railroad on April 7, 1832, though it was dormant for several years following its incorporation. The company was chartered on March 14, 1849, and organized on January 2, 1850. On April 14, 1851, its name was changed to Lackawanna and Western Railroad. The line opened on December 20, 1851, and ran north from Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Great Bend, Pennsylvania, just south of Pennsylvania&#x27;s border with New York state. From Great Bend, the railroad obtained trackage rights north and west over the New York and Erie Rail Road to Owego, New York, where it leased the Cayuga and Susquehanna Railroad to Ithaca on Cayuga Lake on April 21, 1855.

The C&amp;S was the reorganized and partially rebuilt Ithaca and Owego Railroad, which had opened on April 1, 1834, and was the oldest part of its system. The whole system was built to broad gauge, the same as the New York and Erie, although the original I&amp;O was built to standard gauge and converted to wide gauge when rebuilt as the C&amp;S.

The &quot;Delaware and Cobb&#x27;s Gap Railroad&quot; was chartered December 4, 1850, to build a line from Scranton east to the Delaware River. Before it opened, the Delaware and Cobb&#x27;s Gap and Lackawanna and Western were consolidated by the Lackawanna Steel Company into one company, the &quot;Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad&quot;, on March 11, 1853. On the New Jersey side of the Delaware River, the Warren Railroad was chartered on February 12, 1851, to continue from the bridge over the river southeast to Hampton, on the Central Railroad of New Jersey. That section got its name from Warren County, the county through which it would primarily run.

===Expansion and profits (1853–1940)===

The rest of the line, now known as the Southern Division, opened on May 27, 1856, including the Warren Railroad in New Jersey. A third rail was added to the standard gauge Central Railroad of New Jersey east of Hampton to allow the railroad to run east to Elizabeth via trackage rights (the CNJ was extended in 1864 to Jersey City).

On December 10, 1868, the company acquired the Morris and Essex Railroad unit 1945 it was fully merged into the DL&amp;W. This line ran east–west across northern New Jersey, crossing the Warren Railroad at Washington and providing access to Jersey City without depending on the CNJ. The M&amp;E tunnel under Bergen Hill opened in 1876, relieving the Morris and Essex Railroad and its owners, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, from having to use the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway&#x27;s tunnel to reach Jersey City. Along with the M&amp;E lease came several branch lines in New Jersey, including the Boonton Line, which opened in 1870 and bypassed Newark for through freight.

The railroad acquired the Syracuse, Binghamton and New York Railroad in 1869 and leased the Oswego and Syracuse Railroad on February 13, 1869. This gave it a branch from Binghamton north and northwest via Syracuse to Oswego, a port on Lake Ontario. The &quot;Greene Railroad&quot; was organized in 1869, opened in 1870, and was immediately leased to the company, providing a short branch off the Oswego line from Chenango Forks to Greene. Also in 1870, the company leased the Utica, Chenango and Susquehanna Valley Railway, continuing this branch north to Utica, with a branch from Richfield Junction to Richfield Springs (fully opened in 1872).

The &quot;Valley Railroad&quot; was organized March 3, 1869, to connect the end of the original line at Great Bend, Pennsylvania, to Binghamton, New York, avoiding reliance on the Erie. The new line opened on October 1, 1871. By 1873, the company controlled the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad, a branch from Scranton southwest to Northumberland with trackage rights over the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Northern Central Railway to Sunbury. On March 15, 1876, the whole system was re-gauged to standard gauge in one day. The New York, Lackawanna and Western Railroad was chartered on August 26, 1880, and opened on September 17, 1882, to continue the railroad from Binghamton west and northwest to Buffalo. The main line ran to the International Bridge to Ontario, and a branch served downtown Buffalo. A spur from Wayland served Hornellsville (Hornell). On December 1, 1903, the company began operating the Erie and Central New York Railroad, a branch of the Oswego line from Cortland Junction east to Cincinnatus. That same year, it also began to control the Bangor and Portland Railway. By 1909, the company controlled the Bangor and Portland Railway. This line branched from the main line at Portland, southwest to Nazareth, with a branch to Martins Creek. The Delaware Valley Railway was organized with visions of linking the Lackawanna north to the Erie Railroad at Port Jervis, New York beginning with plans in 1893 and construction in 1901. Trains ran north from East Stroudsburg only as far as Bushkill, and the twelve-mile line was abandoned in 1937.

The primary locomotive and car shops were located in Scranton. In 1910 they were enlarged and upgraded at a cost of $2 million, including a massive machine and erecting shop measuring 582 by 342 feet. To handle the increasing roster of coal and other freight cars, new car shops were built outside Scranton at Keyser Valley in 1904. A passenger car shop was added in Kingsland, New Jersey, nine miles from New York City, in 1906.

===New terminals and realignments===

The company built a Beaux-Arts terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1907, and another Beaux-Arts passenger station (now a Radisson hotel) in Scranton the following year. A new terminal was constructed on the waterfront in Buffalo in 1917.

The &quot;Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey&quot;, chartered on February 7, 1908, to build the Lackawanna Cut-Off (a.k.a. New Jersey Cutoff or Hopatcong-Slateford Cutoff), opened on December 24, 1911. This provided a low-grade cutoff in northwestern New Jersey. The cutoff included the Delaware River Viaduct and the Paulinskill Viaduct, as well as three concrete towers at Port Morris and Greendell in New Jersey and Slateford Junction in Pennsylvania. From 1912 to 1915, the Summit-Hallstead Cutoff (a.k.a. Pennsylvania Cutoff or Nicholson Cutoff) was built to revamp a winding and hilly system between Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, and Hallstead, Pennsylvania. This rerouting provided another quicker low-grade line between Scranton and Binghamton. The Summit Cutoff included the massive Tunkhannock Viaduct and Martins Creek Viaduct. The Lackawanna&#x27;s cutoffs had no at-grade crossings with roads or highways, allowing high-speed service.

===Passenger operations===

The railroad ran trains from its Hoboken Terminal, its gateway to New York City, to its Scranton, Binghamton, Syracuse, Oswego, and Buffalo stations and to Utica Union Station.
Noteworthy among these were:

*Nos. 2 &quot;Pocono Express&quot; / 5 &quot;Twilight&quot; (Hoboken to Buffalo with New York Central connections to Chicago)
*Nos. 3 / 6 &quot;Phoebe Snow&quot;, also known as the &quot;Lackawanna Limited&quot; (Hoboken-Buffalo)
*Nos. 7 &quot;Westerner&quot; / 8 &quot;New Yorker&quot; (Hoboken to Buffalo, with Nickel Plate &quot;Nickel Plate Limited&quot; connection to Chicago) 
*Nos. 10 &quot;New York Mail&quot; / 15 &quot;Owl&quot; (Hoboken to Buffalo)
*Nos. 1301 / 1306 &quot;Interstate Express&quot; (Philadelphia to Syracuse)
*Nos. 1702 &quot;Keystone Express&quot; / 1705 &quot;Pittsburgh Express&quot; (Scranton to Pittsburgh)

The railroad also ran commuter operations from the North Jersey suburbs to Hoboken on the Boonton, Gladstone, Montclair and Morristown Lines. Early publicity for the passenger service featured a young woman, Phoebe Snow, who always wore white and kept her clothing clean while riding the &quot;Road of Anthracite&quot;, powered by the clean-burning coal known as anthracite.

===Decline (1940–1960)===
The most profitable commodity shipped by the railroad was anthracite coal. In 1890 and during 1920–1940, the DL&amp;W shipped upwards of 14% of the state of Pennsylvania&#x27;s anthracite production. Other profitable freight included dairy products, cattle, lumber, cement, steel and grain. The Pocono Mountains region was one of the most popular vacation destinations in the country—especially among New Yorkers—and several large hotels sat along the line in Northeastern Pennsylvania, generating a large passenger traffic for the Lackawanna. All of this helped justify the railroad&#x27;s expansion of its double-track mainline to three and in a few places four tracks.


Changes in the region&#x27;s economy undercut the railroad, however. The post-World War II boom enjoyed by many U.S. cities bypassed Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and the rest of Lackawanna and Luzerne counties. Fuel oil and natural gas quickly became the preferred energy sources. Silk and other textile industries shrank as jobs moved to the southern U.S. or overseas. The advent of mechanical refrigeration squeezed the business from ice ponds on top of the Poconos. Even the dairy industry changed. The Lackawanna had long enjoyed revenues from milk shipments; many stations had a creamery next to the tracks.

Perhaps the most catastrophic blows to the Lackawanna, however, were dealt by Mother Nature. In August 1955, flooding from Hurricane Diane devastated the Pocono Mountains region, killing 80 people. The floods cut the Lackawanna Railroad in 88 places, destroying of track, stranding several trains (with a number of passengers aboard) and shutting down the railroad for nearly a month (with temporary speed restrictions prevailing on the damaged sections of railroad for months), causing a total of $8.1 million in damages (equal to $ in ) and lost revenue. One section, the Old River line (former Warren Railroad), was damaged beyond repair and had to be abandoned altogether. Until the mainline in Pennsylvania reopened, all trains were canceled or rerouted over other railroads. The Lackawanna would never fully recover.

In January 1959, the final nail was driven in the Lackawanna&#x27;s coffin by the Knox Mine Disaster, which flooded the mines along the Susquehanna River and all but obliterated what was left of the region&#x27;s anthracite industry.

The Lackawanna Railroad&#x27;s financial problems were not unique. Rail traffic in the U.S. in general declined after World War II as trucks and automobiles took freight and passenger traffic. Declining freight traffic put the nearby New York, Ontario and Western Railroad and Lehigh &amp; New England Railroad out of business in 1957 and 1961, respectively. Over the next three decades, nearly every major railroad in the Northeastern US would go bankrupt.

===Erie merger and aftermath (1956–present)===
====Erie Lackawanna====
In the wake of Hurricane Diane in 1955, all signs pointed to continued financial decline and eventual bankruptcy for the DL&amp;W. Among other factors, property taxes in New Jersey were a tremendous financial drain on the Lackawanna and other railroads that ran through the state: a situation that would not be remedied for another two decades.

To save his company, Lackawanna president Perry Shoemaker sought a merger with the Nickel Plate Road, a deal that would have created a railroad stretching more than from St. Louis, Missouri and Chicago, Illinois to New York City and would have allowed the Lackawanna to retain the of double-track mainline between Buffalo and Binghamton, New York. The idea had been studied as early as 1920, when William Z. Ripley, a professor of political economics at Harvard University, reported that a merger would have benefited both railroads. Forty years later, however, the Lackawanna was a shadow of its former financial self. Seeing no advantage in an end-to-end merger, Nickel Plate officials also rebuffed attempts by the DL&amp;W, which owned a substantial block of Nickel Plate stock, to place one of its directors on the Nickel Plate board. (The Nickel Plate would later merge with the Norfolk and Western Railroad.)

Shoemaker next turned, in 1956, to aggressive but unsuccessful efforts to obtain joint operating agreements and even potential mergers with the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Delaware and Hudson Railway.

Finally, Shoemaker sought and won a merger agreement with the Erie Railroad, the DL&amp;W&#x27;s longtime rival (and closest geographical competitor), forming the Erie Lackawanna Railroad.

The merger was formally consummated on October 17, 1960. Shoemaker drew much criticism for it, and would even second-guess himself after he had retired from railroading. He later claimed to have had a &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; with the EL board of directors to take over as president of the new railroad. After he was pushed aside in favor of Erie managers, however, he left in disillusionment and became the president of the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1962.

Even before the formal merger, growing ties between the Erie and Lackawanna led to the partial abandonment of the Lackawanna&#x27;s mainline trackage between Binghamton and Buffalo. In 1958, the main line of the DL&amp;W from Binghamton west to near Corning, which closely paralleled the Erie&#x27;s main line, was abandoned in favor of joint operations, while the Lackawanna Cut-Off in New Jersey was single-tracked in anticipation of the upcoming merger. On the other hand, the Erie&#x27;s Buffalo, New York and Erie Railroad was dropped from Corning to Livonia in favor of the DL&amp;W&#x27;s main line. Most passenger service was routed onto the DL&amp;W east of Binghamton, with the DL&amp;W&#x27;s Hoboken Terminal serving all EL passenger trains. In addition, a short segment of the Boonton Branch by Garret Mountain in Paterson, New Jersey, was sold off to the state of New Jersey to build Interstate 80. Ultimately, the west end of the Boonton Branch was combined with the Erie&#x27;s Greenwood Lake Branch, while the eastern end was combined with the Erie&#x27;s main line, which was abandoned through Passaic, New Jersey. Sacrificed was the Boonton Branch, a high-speed freight line thought to be redundant with the Erie&#x27;s mainline. This would haunt EL management less than a decade later (and Conrail management a decade after that).

Soon after the merger, the new EL management shifted most freight trains to the &quot;Erie side&quot;, the former Erie Railroad lines, leaving only a couple of daily freight trains traveling over the Lackawanna side. Passenger train traffic would not be affected, at least not immediately. This traffic pattern would remain in effect for more than ten years—past the discontinuation of passenger service on January 6, 1970—and was completely dependent on the lucrative interchange with the New Haven Railroad at Maybrook, New York. The January 1, 1969 merger of the New Haven Railroad into the Penn Central Railroad changed all this: the New England Gateway was downgraded, and closed on May 8, 1974 by fire damage to the New Haven&#x27;s Poughkeepsie Bridge, causing dramatic traffic changes for the Lackawanna side. Indeed, as very little on-line freight originated on the Erie side (a route that was more than 20 miles longer than the DL&amp;W route to Binghamton), once the Gateway was closed (eliminating the original justification for shifting traffic to the Erie side) virtually all the EL&#x27;s freight trains were shifted back to the Lackawanna side. After the New England Gateway closed, EL&#x27;s management was forced to downgrade the Erie side, and even considered its abandonment west of Port Jervis. In the meantime, the EL was forced to run its long freights over the reconfigured Boonton Line, which east of Mountain View in Wayne, NJ meant running over the Erie&#x27;s Greenwood Lake Branch, a line that was never intended to carry the level of freight traffic to which the EL would subject it.

In 1972, the Central Railroad of New Jersey abandoned all its operations in Pennsylvania (which by that time were freight-only), causing additional through freights to be run daily between Elizabeth, NJ on the CNJ and Scranton on the EL. The trains, designated as the eastbound SE-98 and the westbound ES-99, travelled via the Lackawanna Cut-Off and were routed via the CNJ&#x27;s High Bridge Branch. This arrangement ended with the creation of Conrail on April 1, 1976.

During its time, the EL diversified its shipments from the growing Lehigh Valley and also procured a lucrative contract with Chrysler to ship auto components from Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. The EL also aggressively sought other contracts with suppliers in the area, pioneering what came to be known as intermodal shipping. None of this could compensate for the decline in coal shipments, however, and, as labor costs and taxes rose, the railroad&#x27;s financial position became increasingly precarious although it was stronger than some railroads in the eastern U.S.

The opening of Interstates I-80, I-380, and I-81 during the early 1970s, which in effect paralleled much of the former Lackawanna mainline east of Binghamton, New York, caused more traffic to be diverted to trucks. This only helped to accelerate the EL&#x27;s decline. By 1976, it was apparent that the EL was at the end of its tether, and it petitioned to join Conrail: a new regional railroad that was created on April 1, 1976, out of the remnants of seven bankrupt freight railroads in the northeastern U.S.

====Conrail====

The EL&#x27;s rail property was legally conveyed into Conrail on April 1, 1976. Labor contracts limited immediate changes to the freight schedule, but in early 1979, Conrail suspended through freight service on the Lackawanna side. The railroad removed freight traffic from the Hoboken-Binghamton mainline and consolidated the service within its other operating routes. Railroad officials said the primary reasons were the EL&#x27;s early-1960s severing of the Boonton Branch near Paterson, New Jersey, and the grades over the Pocono Mountains.

The Morristown Line is the only piece of multi-track railroad on the entire 900-mile Lackawanna system that has not been reduced to fewer tracks over the years. It was triple-tracked nearly a century prior, and remains so today.

The Lackawanna Cut-Off was abandoned in 1979 and its rails were removed in 1984. The line between Slateford Junction and Scranton remained in legal limbo for nearly a decade, but was eventually purchased, with a single track left in place. The Lackawanna Cut-Off&#x27;s right-of-way, on the other hand, was purchased by the state of New Jersey in 2001 from funds approved within a $40 million bond issue in 1989. (A court later set the final price at $21 million, paid to owners Jerry Turco of Kearny, New Jersey and Burton Goldmeier of Hopatcong, New Jersey.) NJ Transit has estimated that it would cost $551 million to restore service to Scranton over the Cut-Off: a price which includes the cost of new trainsets. A 7.3-mile section of the Cut-Off between Port Morris and Andover, New Jersey, which was under construction, was delayed until 2021 due to environmental issues on the Andover station site; the Cut-Off between Port Morris and Andover is slated to re-open for rail passenger service no earlier than 2025.

====Delaware and Hudson (later Canadian Pacific)====
In 1979, Conrail sold most of the DL&amp;W in Pennsylvania, with the DL&amp;W main line portion between Scranton and Binghamton (which includes the Nicholson Cutoff) bought by the Delaware and Hudson Railway. The D&amp;H was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1991. CPR continued to run this portion of the DL&amp;W main line until 2014, when it sold it to the Norfolk Southern.

====New York, Susquehanna, and Western====
The Syracuse and Utica branches north of Binghamton were sold by Conrail to the Delaware Otsego Corp., which operates them as the northern division of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway.

====Norfolk Southern====
In 1997, Conrail accepted an offer of purchase from CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway. On June 1, 1999, Norfolk Southern took over many of the Conrail lines in New Jersey, including most of the former DL&amp;W. It also purchased the remnants of the former Bangor &amp; Portland branch in Pennsylvania. Norfolk Southern continues to operate local freights on the lines. In 2014, it purchased the former DL&amp;W main from Taylor, PA to Binghamton, NY from the Canadian Pacific Railway, which it continues to operate to this day.

====NJ Transit====

NJ Transit Rail Operations took over passenger operations in 1983. The State of New Jersey had subsidized the routes operated by the Erie Lackawanna, and later Conrail. NJ Transit operates over former DL&amp;W trackage on much of the former Morris &amp; Essex Railroad to Gladstone and Hackettstown. In 2002, the transit agency consolidated the Montclair Branch and Boonton Line to create the Montclair-Boonton Line. NJ Transit also operates on the remaining portion (south of Paterson) of the original Boonton Line known as the Main Line. NJ Transit&#x27;s hub is at Hoboken Terminal.

Trains on the Morristown Line run directly into New York&#x27;s Pennsylvania Station via the Kearny Connection, opened in 1996. This facilitates part of NJ Transit&#x27;s popular Midtown Direct service. Formerly, the line ran solely to the DL&amp;W&#x27;s historic terminal in Hoboken and a transfer to underground rapid transit was required to pass under the Hudson river into Manhattan, or a ferry. This is the only section of former Lackawanna trackage that has more through tracks now than ever before.

====Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Railroad Authority====
Since the 1999 breakup of Conrail, the former DL&amp;W main line from Scranton south-east to Slateford in Monroe County has been owned by the Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Railroad Authority (PNRRA). The Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad and Steamtown National Historic Site operates freight trains and tourist trains on this stretch of track, dubbed the Pocono Mainline (or Pocono Main). Under a haulage agreement with Norfolk Southern, the D-L runs unit Canadian grain trains between Scranton and the Harvest States Grain Mill at Pocono Summit, Pennsylvania and wood deliveries to Bestway Enterprises in Cresco. Other commercial customers include Keystone Propane in Tobyhanna. Excursion trains, hauled by visiting Nickel Plate 765 and other locomotives, run from Steamtown to Moscow and Tobyhanna (with infrequent extensions to East Stroudsburg or Delaware Water Gap Station, both on the Pocono Mainline).

The D-L also runs Lackawanna County&#x27;s tourist trolleys from the Electric City Trolley Museum, under overhead electrified wiring installed on original sections of the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad that was also purchased by Lackawanna County. It also runs trains on a remnant of the DL&amp;W Diamond branch in Scranton.

In 2006, the Monroe County and Lackawanna County Railroad Authorities formed the Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority to accelerate the resumption of passenger train service between New York City and Scranton.

====Other remnants====
===== New York =====
Most of the main line west of Binghamton in New York State has been abandoned, in favor of the Erie&#x27;s Buffalo line via Hornell. The longest remaining main line sector is Painted Post-Wayland, with shortline service provided by B&amp;H Railroad (Bath &amp; Hammondsport, a division of the Livonia, Avon, and Lakeville Railroad). Shorter main line remnants are Groveland-Greigsville (Genesee &amp; Wyoming) and Lancaster-Depew (Depew, Lancaster &amp; Western). The Richfield Springs branch was scrapped in 1998 after being out of service for years; much of the right of way was purchased in 2009 by Utica, Chenango and Susquehanna Valley LLC of Richfield Springs, New York, which as of 2022 operates a narrow-gauge tourist railway Richfield Springs Scenic Railway on a portion of the line and a walking trail on another section. The Cortland-Cincinnatus Branch, abandoned by Erie Lackawanna in 1960, was partially-rebuilt for an industrial spur about 1999.

===== Pennsylvania =====
As of 2018, the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern operates the former Keyser Valley branch from Scranton to Taylor, as well as the former Bloomsburg branch from Taylor to Coxton Yard in Duryea. The Luzerne and Susquehanna Railway operates the former Bloomsburg branch from Duryea to Kingston. The North Shore Railroad (Pennsylvania) operates the former Bloomsburg branch from Northumberland to Hicks Ferry.

<text>Vernors is an American brand of ginger ale owned by Keurig Dr Pepper that was first served in 1866 by James Vernor, a pharmacist from Detroit.

== History ==
Vernors is the oldest surviving ginger ale in the United States. According to the company, it was first served to the American public in 1866.
Vernor opened a drugstore of his own in Detroit, Michigan, on Woodward Avenue, on the southwest corner of Clifford Street and sold his ginger soda at its soda fountain. Initially, Vernors was only sold via soda fountain franchises. In 1896, Vernor closed his drugstore and opened a soda fountain closer to the city center to concentrate on the ginger ale business alone, on Woodward Avenue south of Jefferson Avenue, near the ferry docks on the Detroit River. The early Vernors soda fountains featured ornate plaster, lighting and ironwork featuring a &quot;V&quot; design, examples of which still exist, such as at the Halo Burger restaurant in Flint, Michigan. Later, Vernor also sold bottling franchises in other cities, requiring operators to adhere strictly to his recipe.

Vernor died October 29, 1927, and was succeeded by his son, James Vernor Jr. Expansion continued throughout Prohibition. Just prior to the onset of World War II, Vernors built a bottling plant and headquarters encompassing an entire city block on Woodward Avenue, one block from the Detroit River. In the late 1950s, when the City of Detroit proposed construction of Cobo Hall and other riverfront projects, a land-swap was negotiated, and Vernors moved its bottling plant and headquarters to the location of the old civic exhibition hall at 4501 Woodward Avenue, incorporating many of the popular features of the old plant. Tours of the Vernors plant old and new were major tourist attractions.

The brand was originally sold as Vernor&#x27;s; the apostrophe was dropped in 1959. In 1962, Vernors introduced Vernors 1-Calorie, now called Vernors Zero Sugar.

In 1966, the Vernor family sold out to the first of what became a succession of owners. The company was next acquired by American Consumer Products and then by United Brands. The flagship Detroit bottling plant was shut down in 1985, with the local rights to bottle Vernors granted to Pepsi-Cola. The Woodward Avenue plant was later demolished. The Vernors brand was purchased by A&amp;W Beverages in 1987, which was in turn purchased by Cadbury Schweppes. Today, Vernors is property of Keurig Dr Pepper of Burlington, Massachusetts, and Plano, Texas, and the flagship bottling plant serving Michigan is the Keurig Dr Pepper bottling plant in Holland, Michigan.

In August 2022, Vernors released a black cherry flavor, its first new flavor in more than 50 years. The limited-time product was only available in Michigan and the Toledo, Ohio, area.

== Characteristics ==
Vernors is a sweet &quot;golden&quot; ginger ale that derives its color, like other commercial, industrially produced ginger ales, from caramel, and has a robust, vanilla-heavy flavor. The Vernors style was common before Prohibition, during which &quot;dry&quot; pale, less sweet ginger ale (typified by Canada Dry Ginger Ale) became popular as a drink mixer.

Vernors is highly carbonated.

Los Angeles Metropolitan News-Enterprise Editor Roger Grace describes the original flavor as &quot;mellow yet perky&quot; with the mellowness attributed to the aging in oak barrels, and the perkiness to the use of more ginger than &quot;dry&quot; ginger ales.

=== Formula ===
A company-spread legend once held that prior to the start of the American Civil War James Vernor, then a clerk at the Higby &amp; Sterns drugstore in Detroit, experimented with flavors in an attempt to duplicate a popular ginger ale imported from Dublin, Ireland. When Vernor was called off to serve he stored the syrup base of 19 ingredients, including ginger, vanilla and other natural flavorings, in an oaken cask. When he was discharged four years later he found the concentrate had been changed by being aged in the wood. The drink made from it was like nothing else he had ever tasted, and he purportedly declared it &quot;Deliciously different,&quot; which remains the drink&#x27;s motto to this day.

In a 1936 interview, however, James Vernor Jr., admitted that the formula was not developed by his father until after the war was over. This was confirmed both in a 1962 interview with former company president, James Vernor Davis, and a 1911 trademark application on &quot;Vernor&#x27;s&quot; as a name for ginger ale and extract indicating Vernor&#x27;s ginger ale first entered commerce in 1880.

== Distribution ==
For most of its history, Vernors was a regional product. Initially Vernor sold franchises throughout Michigan and in major regional cities; the product was also available in Ontario, Canada. In the 1970s and 1980s Vernors-flavored ice cream was sold by Sanders Confectionery.

Vernors was not mass distributed nationally for many years; by 1997, the brand&#x27;s distribution had expanded to a 33-state area. In 1997, even after expansion, Michigan accounted for 80% of Vernors sales. Ohio and Illinois were the next-highest-selling states; the drink was also very popular in Florida, which has large numbers of retired or relocated former Michigan residents. In 2015, Dr Pepper Snapple said that it sold more than 7 million cases of Vernors, about 1% of the company&#x27;s total sales volume. At that time, a &quot;large percentage — although not a majority — of the sales&quot; were in Michigan.

== Promotions ==
A number of slogans have been associated with Vernors over the years. Advertising in the early 1900s used the slogan &quot;Detroit&#x27;s Drink&quot;. According to its trademark application, it began using the slogan &quot;Deliciously Different&quot; in 1921. The labels formerly read &quot;Aged 4 years in wood&quot;, which was changed some years ago to &quot;Flavor aged in oak barrels&quot;, again in 1996 to &quot;Barrel Aged, Bold Taste&quot; and currently notes &quot;Barrel Aged 3 Years • Bold Taste&quot;. The apostrophe in the name &quot;Vernor&#x27;s&quot; was dropped in the late 1950s. For a time in the mid-1980s, Vernors used the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s what we drink around here&quot; in its advertising campaigns. The gnome mascot, named &quot;Woody&quot;, was used from the start of the 20th century until 1987, when it was dropped by A&amp;W Brands in favor of new packaging, but had returned to the packaging by the 2000s. As recently as October 2013, Vernors features a picture of Woody with the slogan &quot;A Michigan Original Since 1866&quot;, plus a picture of a barrel with the slogan &quot;Barrel Aged – Bold Taste&quot;. As of January 2016, the wording surrounding the picture was changed to &quot;Authentic • Bold Taste&quot;.

The identity of the Vernors gnome mascot has been contested and as a result, there is significant local folklore surrounding the gnome. While the Dr. Pepper company insists the name of the gnome has always been Woody, Lawrence L. Rouch, Vernors historian, argues this was not the case. He agrees that the gnome mascot surfaced sometime in the early 1900s and lasted through to the 1980s, but found no historical evidence of the name “Woody” being associated with the gnome.

There is general consensus, however, of Ronald Bialecki&#x27;s live-action appearances as the gnome in the 1970s. According to both Vernors historians and Bialecki&#x27;s family members, he was employed with the Doner Company at the time, which was the advertising firm in charge of the Vernors account. His arrival at work one morning was followed by widespread agreement amongst both Vernors representatives and Doner ad executives that he should be cast as the gnome. Bialecki was so dedicated to the role that he and his wife created a gnome costume for public appearances. During his time as the Vernors mascot, Bialecki made personal appearances in the &quot;gnome mobile&quot; which he also designed for the enjoyment of the local public.

=== 150th anniversary ===
The Detroit Historical Society and Museum teamed up with the Vernor&#x27;s Collectors&#x27; Club and the Detroit Experience Factory to celebrate the brand. Starting June 7, 2016, a Vernors memorabilia exhibition showed artifacts and vintage signage from the brand. The feature ran through June 12, 2016, at the Detroit Historical Museum.

== Use ==
Some people drink Vernors hot as a remedy for stomach ache. Others, such as some Detroit natives, add it to impart a sweet and spicy flavor to dishes. Soul singer Aretha Franklin became famous in the city for demonstrating a recipe, traditionally at her church, for Christmas ham with a glaze made with the soft drink; Vernors has also been used in a glaze for salmon and in a batter for onion rings.

=== Boston Cooler ===

A Boston Cooler, also known as a Vernors float, is an ice cream soda variant typically composed of Vernors Ginger Ale and vanilla ice cream blended together similar to a milkshake; however, in other parts of the United States, different combinations of ingredients are also known as a Boston Cooler. Some native Detroiters simply put a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream in a glass, add Vernors and a soda straw, and call it a Boston Cooler. While some claim it is named Boston Cooler for being invented on Boston Boulevard in Detroit, but Boston Boulevard had not been developed when the drink was named.

<text>John Ripin Miller (May 23, 1938 – October 4, 2017) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1985 to 1993. He represented the of Washington as a Republican. While in Congress he was an advocate of human rights in the Soviet Union, China, and South Africa.

== Biography ==
Miller received his LL.B. from Yale Law School and an MA in Economics from Yale Graduate School in 1964. He graduated with a BA from Bucknell University in 1959, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and served as an Army Infantry officer on active duty in 1960 and later in the U.S. Army Reserves.

Miller did not run for re-election in 1992. Prior to being elected congressman, he was active in state and municipal governments, serving as assistant attorney general for Washington; vice president and legal counsel for the Washington Environmental Council; and Seattle City Councilman (1972–1979). Miller&#x27;s first campaign for the City Council was tied to saving the Pike Place Market and while on the Council he oversaw the rehabilitation of the Market. He founded Seattle&#x27;s urban P-Patch program, a gardening allotment program that was first of its kind in the nation which includes at least 90 sites as of 2016. Miller led the Council in rejecting Seattle&#x27;s entry into Washington Public Power Supply System nuclear plants 4 and 5 (Satsop nuclear power plant) which later went bankrupt, and unsuccessfully sought the demolition of the Alaska Way Viaduct separating Seattle&#x27;s downtown from its waterfront.

Miller served as the director, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons for the U.S. State Department, with the rank of Ambassador-at-Large, starting in 2002. He sought to increase public awareness of modern-day slavery and nurture a worldwide abolitionist movement with the United States in the lead. Miller resigned effective December 15, 2006, to join the faculty of George Washington University. He later taught at Yale University and was named a visiting scholar at the Institute for Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Miller served as a distinguished senior fellow in international affairs and human rights with the Discovery Institute. Prior to his time at State, he had served as the chair of the institute, and was an English teacher at Northwest Yeshiva High School in Mercer Island, Washington.

On October 4, 2017, Miller died in Corte Madera, California from cancer at the age of 79.

<text>Joel McFee Pritchard (May 5, 1925 – October 9, 1997) was an American businessman and politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives and as the 14th Lieutenant Governor of Washington as a member of the Republican Party, and is the most recent to have held that office as of 2024.

Pritchard also invented the game of pickleball, along with two friends, in 1965.

==Political career==
Pritchard was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1956 that renominated Dwight D. Eisenhower for the presidency.

He was elected to the Washington House of Representatives representing Washington&#x27;s thirty-sixth district in 1958, where he served from 1959 to 1967, being reelected in 1960, 1962 and 1964. In the state house, he worked closely with future U.S. Senators Daniel J. Evans and Slade Gorton.

In 1966, he was elected to the Washington State Senate, where he served a single term from 1967 to 1971. In 1970 Pritchard, a member of Washington Citizens for Abortion Reform (WCAR), introduced a bill allowing abortions in the first four months of pregnancy; it was approved and went to the voters as Referendum 20. The measure was approved statewide by voters in November 1970, making Washington the first state to in which abortion was legalized by a popular vote.

In 1970, Pritchard ran for the U.S. House of Representatives to represent Washington&#x27;s first district, challenging nine-term incumbent Thomas Pelly in the Republican primary. Pelly was renominated, but by a smaller margin than anyone expected.

In 1972, Pelly retired and Pritchard ran for the U.S. House of Representatives again, this time successfully, defeating opponents John Hempleman and Craig Honts in a closely contested election. He was easily reelected in 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980 and 1982, serving from 1973 to 1985. He chose not to run for reelection in 1984.

In 1988, he made a successful run for Lieutenant Governor of Washington, becoming president of the Washington Senate. He was reelected in 1992, serving from 1989 to 1997.

==Personal life==
Pritchard was the second son of Frank and Jean (McFee) Pritchard. He was born on May 5, 1925, in Seattle, Washington, where he attend public schools, and graduated from Queen Anne High School in June 1944.

At the rank of Sergeant, he served in the United States Army from 1944 to 1946. After leaving the service, he attended Marietta College in Ohio from 1946 to 1947. He worked for the Griffin Envelope Company in Seattle from 1948 to 1971 where he became president of the company.

In 1965, while serving in the Washington State Senate, Pritchard, along with friends Bill Bell and Barney McCallum, invented the game of pickleball at his summer home on Bainbridge Island, Washington.

After the end of his second term as Lieutenant Governor, Pritchard went into retirement and became a board member of TVW, the state of Washington&#x27;s public affairs network. He died on October 9, 1997, in Olympia, Washington, of lymphoma.

<text>The European Monetary Institute (EMI) was the forerunner of the European Central Bank (ECB), operating between 1994 and 1998.

==History==
The EMI was created 1st January 1994 to oversee the second stage in the creation of monetary union. The EMI itself replaced the earlier European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF). The EMI met for the first time on 12 January under its first President, Alexandre Lamfalussy. On 1st July 1997 Lamfalussy was replaced by Wim Duisenberg who later became the ECB&#x27;s President. The institute was dissolved on 1st June 1998 with the creation of the ECB and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) which took over its expanded responsibilities in preparation for the euro&#x27;s introduction.

==Role==
The EMI was the key monetary institution of the second phase of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union. The EMU encouraged cooperation between the national banks of the member states of the European Union (EU) and laid the foundation for the euro. It had less than 250 staff, mostly seconded from national central banks, and was based in the Eurotower, Frankfurt (Germany), where the ECB is now based.

<doc id="813844" wikidata="Q6825317" url="?curid=813844" title="Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments">
<text>Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) is an independent, nonprofit association designed to address regional issues confronting Washington, D.C., suburban Maryland, and Northern Virginia. It was founded in 1957.

MWCOG comprises 24 local governments in the Washington metropolitan area, including the Maryland and Virginia state legislatures, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives. About 300 local, state, and federally elected officials make up its membership. and formally incorporated on May 28, 1965.

==Functions==
===Transportation===
MWCOG has provided leadership in supporting the development of transportation facilities in the region, including the Washington Metro subway system and Washington Dulles International Airport.

MWCOG supports the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board, the federally designated Metropolitan Planning Organization for the metropolitan Washington area. The National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board is responsible for ensuring state and federal approval of funding for transportation projects. National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board became associated with MWCOG in 1966. National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board&#x27;s data informs officials on subjects like regional travel patterns and highway and transit performance. Recent projects include identifying regional transportation priorities and funding strategies, improving access for people with disabilities, and better coordinating transportation and land use decisions.

===Environment===
Through the Metropolitan Washington Air Quality Committee, which is the entity certified by the mayor of Washington, D.C. and the governors of Maryland and Virginia to prepare an air-quality plan for the Washington metropolitan area under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, officials prepare clean air plans. These plans have led to steady improvement in regional air quality.

MWCOG supports ongoing efforts to revitalize the Chesapeake Bay, the Anacostia River, other local waterways, and wastewater and storm-water planning, and water-supply protection.

MWCOG guides the regional effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by promoting alternative energy sources, energy conservation, and green building and fleet policies.

===Planning and housing===
MWCOG&#x27;s Community Planning and Services program promotes a strong economy, sustainable growth, and housing options for all residents. MWCOG offers strategies for more development in the region&#x27;s mixed-use activity centers and provides the region with population, employment, and housing forecasts, and data on area industries and labor, affordable housing, and homelessness.

MWCOG regularly measures progress towards the goals of &quot;Region Forward&quot;, a long-term sustainability-planning process initiated in 2008.

<doc id="813868" wikidata="Q2426465" url="?curid=813868" title="Thomas Pelly">
<text>Thomas Minor Pelly (August 22, 1902 – November 21, 1973) was an American politician. He served as a U.S. Representative from the state of Washington between 1953 and 1973.

== Early life ==
Pelly was born on August 22, 1902, in Seattle, Washington. His parents were Bernard Pelly, the British consul to Seattle and Elizabeth Montgomery Minor Pelly, the daughter of former mayor of Seattle Thomas T. Minor. He attended Summit School and the University School in Victoria, British Columbia, before taking classes at the Hoosac School in Hoosick, New York. He renounced his British citizenship at the age of 21.

He worked various jobs: first with the West and Wheeler Real Estate Company and then with the Seattle National Bank where he was eventually promoted to trust officer in the late 1920s, after joining as a foot messenger. He married Mary Virginia Taylor in 1927, after meeting her on Bainbridge Island, where his family had a house. The couple had two children: Marion Elizabeth and Tom Minor Jr. In 1930, he started working for the Lowman &amp; Hanford Stationery Company, during which time he wrote and published &quot;Judgement, and other poems, North-Westward, The Story of Restoration Point and Country Club&quot; and &quot;Dr. Minor: A Sketch of the Background and Life of Thos. T. Minor, M.D.&quot; Five years later, he became the company president.

== Career ==
Pelly first ran for public office in 1932, when he contested a seat in the Washington House of Representatives. His Democratic opponent sued to have Pelly classed as a British citizen and although Pelly won the lawsuit, he lost the election. He was active in the community, serving as vice chair of the Seattle Community Chest and as a director of the Seattle Symphony, the Seattle Art Museum, the Seattle Trust and Savings Bank, the Olympia State Bank and Trust Company, the Shaw and Borden Company, Johnson&#x27;s Inc. of Spokane, the Lakeside School, and the Helen Bush School. During World War II, he joined the council of the Seattle United Service Organization, which assisted military personnel by organizing recreation.

=== Seattle Chamber of Commerce ===
Pelly was elected president of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce in 1949, focusing his efforts on this position. He worked to negotiate a purchase agreement between the city and Puget Sound Power and Light and organized a committee to agree the purchase of a ferryboat system between the Black Ball Line and Governor Arthur B. Langlie. He often traveled through the state to promote Seattle and attended most sessions of the state legislature. He was honored as the First Citizen of the Year by the Seattle-King County Association of Realtors on January 24, 1951, for his work at the chamber of commerce.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
Pelly was first elected to the United States House of Representatives on November 4, 1952, as the representative for the 1st district. He ran as a Republican, receiving 51.37 percent of the vote in the Eisenhower sweep. His district was the largest by population and contained Sand Point Naval Air Station, Fort Lawton and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, as well as Boeing, the Keyport Torpedo Station, and the Bangor Ammunition Depot. He would ultimately serve ten terms in office. In 1966, he won re-election with 80.27 percent of the vote and was the first congressional Republican candidate to be endorsed by the King County Central Labor Council.

Pelly focused on the issues of fisheries and environmental protection during his 20 years in office. He was a member of the House merchant marine and fisheries committee and continuously worked to improve working conditions for merchant marines. He worked with Senator Warren Magnuson to impose sanctions on South American countries who impounded American fishing vessels that violated their claimed territorial waters. Pelly introduced a bill to make the U.S. Maritime Administration an independent agency, and supported the July 1965 establishment of the Joint Oceanographic Research Group in Seattle. He was a member of the House science and astronautics committee, the only one from the Northwest. He voted against H.R. 4671, which would have built two dams near the Grand Canyon, and introduced H. R. 17202 in 1972 which established the North Cascades National Park following a petition with 30,000 signatures collected by The Mountaineers, the Sierra Club, and the North Cascades Conservation Council.

In financial matters, he introduced H. R. 16551 to amend the Social Security Act to adjust social security benefits in line with inflation and supported tax relief for college students and their parents. In 1961, he served as the spokesperson for a group of congressmen who opposed President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s proposed foreign aid plan, which would have involved borrowing $7.3 billion from the U.S. Treasury across five years and spending $4.8 billion in 1961. Pelly’s goal was to review how foreign aid borrowing was occurring and allow the appropriations committee to authorize the funds.

Pelly voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Pelly also voted in favor of Medicare and Medicaid, and was one of 20 House Republicans to vote in favor of the repeal of section (14(B)) of the Taft-Hartley Act, which would have ended right-to-work laws.

Pelly reportedly considered running for governor in the 1964 election and in 1966, he was the preferred vice presidential candidate for Richard Nixon amongst state Republicans, although he never ran for any other office. In 1972, he chose not to seek re-election and he was succeeded by Joel Pritchard.

== Death ==
Pelly died on November 21, 1973, in Ojai, California, while on holiday. He was 71 years old.

<text>Hugh Burnton Mitchell (March 22, 1907June 10, 1996), was an American politician and journalist who served as a member of the United States Senate from 1944 to 1946 and as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1949 to 1953. He represented the state of Washington. He left Dartmouth College and the class of 1930 in 1929 when the Great Crash hit. He traveled to Washington State and a job as a sports reporter in 1929, but the political reporter for the Everett News was removed to prevent bias, as she was involved with the Mayor. Mitchell took over the political beat and, assessing the changing political climate, was among the first if not the first in the area to predict Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s victory as president in 1932.

Mitchell, a Democrat, was appointed on January 10, 1945, to fill a vacancy in the Senate caused by the resignation of Monrad Wallgren, who Mitchell had been executive assistant to since 1933. He proposed extending the Marshall Plan to Asia, seeing economic and infrastructure development as critical to the development of democracy. This was defeated on budget grounds by Republican adversaries, setting the stage for Truman&#x27;s dependence on military containment of communist expansion, and the readmission of France to Viet Nam after World War II as a part of containment. He did not win re-election in 1946, and resigned on December 25, 1946, to give his successor seniority in committee assignments important to Washington State.

In 1948, Mitchell won election to the House of Representatives in the First Congressional District. He won his bid for re-election in 1950. He proposed integrated resource planning for the Columbia River Valley, adding fish and watershed management to irrigation and power production. This was defeated by a coalition of industrial and bureaucratic interests, including irrigation and power production private concerns and the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Land Management, whose authority and budgets were threatened. In 1952, Mitchell did not run for re-election, instead running for Governor of Washington to pursue state development including Columbia River Valley integrated resource development. He was unsuccessful in that election, as well as in his candidacies for the House of Representatives in 1954 and 1958. He was later appointed by President Carter to the Presidential Commission on Japanese Internment during World War II. This Commission considered that Constitutional guarantees had been violated by internment and recommended reparation to those affected.

Mitchell was known as a reformer while in Congress and helped expose the scandal surrounding the sale of World War II surplus property.

<text>Newport Centre, commonly known as Newport Mall, is a shopping mall in Jersey City, New Jersey, that opened in 1987. It is a major component of the enormous Newport, Jersey City, a mixed-use community on the Hudson River waterfront across from Lower Manhattan. One of eleven shopping malls in New Jersey managed by Simon Property Group, it is located at 30 Mall Drive West, and is bound by Henderson Street on the west, Mall Drive East on the east, 6th Street on the south, and Newport Parkway on the north. The mall has a gross leasable area of . The anchor stores are AMC Theatres, JCPenney, Macy&#x27;s, and Kohl&#x27;s. New anchor tenants Primark and Dick’s House of Sport are currently under construction.

== Stores ==

The mall, with four anchors and 165 stores, partially opened to the public in October 1987 with Sears and Stern&#x27;s as two of the four anchors operating. The was intended to draw residents from the new Newport waterfront development and the surrounding area, as well as shoppers from Bergen County, where blue laws keep shopping malls closed on Sundays.

The mall&#x27;s official opening was on November 11, 1987, attended by New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean and Senator Frank Lautenberg. On that date, the mall contained 75 tenants, featuring the two aforementioned anchor stores, Sam Goody, Benetton, Eddie Bauer, and Hallmark.

There are three floors to the mall complex. The mall is part of the Newport Complex, which includes the Newport Tower, the sixth tallest building in Jersey City. Both it and the Hudson Mall are in an &quot;Urban Enterprise Zone&quot;, reducing the state sales tax on purchases from 6.625% to 3.3125% at eligible merchants (with no sales tax on clothing).

The mall is anchored by JCPenney, Kohl&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, and AMC Theatres.

On January 5, 2024, it was announced that Sears, the last location in the state, would be closing at the mall in Spring 2024.

Dick’s House of Sport and Primark moved into the vacant Sears space. Both floors of the former Sears are being renovated with Primark set to open in winter 2025 and Dick’s House of Sport in fall 2025.

== Transportation ==

The mall can be reached via the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail&#x27;s Pavonia/Newport station and the PATH&#x27;s Newport station. It is also served by New Jersey Transit buses and is the terminus for routes from Jersey City Heights and the North Hudson towns of Guttenberg, North Bergen, West New York, and Union City.

==Temporary closure in 2020==
On March 16, 2020, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop ordered the Newport Centre to be closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next day, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy backed this temporary closure and ordered all malls in New Jersey to temporarily close as well. It reopened on June 29, 2020.

<text>Reverend Robert Addison (1754–1829) was a Canadian clergyman and missionary of the Church of England.

He was born in Heversham, Westmorland, the 3rd son of John and Ellinor (Parkinson) of Plumbtreebank. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1777, completing his BA in 1781 and was ordained a Deacon of the Church of England in Norwich, Norfolk, on 11 March 1781.

He married his first wife Mary Atkinson in 1780 in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire. Mary is thought to have been a descendant of Bishop Ridley.

Robert applied to the Church of England&#x27;s Society for the propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts for missionary work in 1791 and was accepted for a position in May of that year. He was only the second Protestant clergyman to venture into Upper Canada, the first being Anglican Rev John Stuart, who arrived in Cataraqui (Kingston) in 1786.

Robert, his two young daughters Elizabeth and Mary and his sister Mary sailed for Canada in the summer and arrived in Quebec, probably in September, where he wintered before proceeding to Upper Canada. His wife Mary did not accompany him as she was pregnant with a son, Robert, born later in 1791. She remained in England and is believed to have suffered from depression and had died, likely in 1796, but possibly as late as 1809. When Rev Robert arrived in Newark, Ontario, in 1792 the government of Upper Canada was located at Newark, until it was moved to York in 1796.

As a young missionary he became chaplain of the legislature. He was the only resident Anglican clergyman, in fact the only clergyman west of Kingston and built the first church in Upper Canada to have regular services, St. Marks, at Niagara-on-the-Lake. This church was completed in 1809. During the War of 1812 it was burned, and restored finally in 1826, much as it is to-day. In 1796 he was the Chaplain of the House of Assembly (the provincial legislature) for which he received $100 a year and by 1798 was being provided 100 pounds per annum for his missionary work.

Before 1809, Rev. Robert Addison had preached in the Masonic Hall and other places. He ministered to Indians and whites from Fort Erie to the Grand River, preaching at intervals to the Mohawks in their church near Brantford, built in 1786. His Niagara congregation included Col. and Mrs. John Butler, Hon. William Dickson, General Isaac Brock, Hon. Robert Hamilton Secord, the Jarvis Family and others. During the War of 1812 he was chaplain of the British and Canadian forces, and, it is said, during his imprisonment by American troops, he ministered to them. He conducted General Brock&#x27;s funeral services at Fort George.

As well as being a clergyman, Robert was an entrepreneur. When the church could not pay him wages for his services rendered to the province he accepted grants of land in the Niagara Peninsula. He petitioned for other land grants in lieu of salary and eventually owned substantial land holdings across the province including lots in the township of Niagara, Stamford, East Flamborough, Dereham, Walsingham, Wawanosm and Deer Park in Toronto. On his death in 1829 he had some 6000 acres (24 km²) of Norwich land in his name. He left the management of this property to his second wife, Rebecca.

Robert brought the first library or collection of books of any significance to Canada when he landed in Niagara in 1792. The books were believed to have originally been the property of his father in law, Richard Atkinson (father of first wife Mary) who was the curate of Whittlesey and died in Oct 1781. They were housed in the rectory for many years and then became property of Brock University. They were repatriated to St Mark&#x27;s Church, (Church of England, now Anglican Church of Canada) which Addison founded at Niagara on the Lake and are now held in The Addison Library in Addison Hall, adjacent to the church. There are over 1200 volumes, many dating to the 16th and 17th century and they are accessible to the public for research purposes.

Addison was followed to Canada by several other family members who settled in southern Ontario in the 1800s.

<text>Emerson Hugh De Lacy (May 9, 1910 – August 19, 1986) was an American politician and socialist. He served on the Seattle City Council from 1937 to 1940 and as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1945 to 1947. He represented the First Congressional District of Washington as a Democrat.

==Early years==
De Lacy was born in Seattle, Washington, and educated in the public schools of the Queen Anne section of Seattle. He graduated from the University of Washington with a master of arts degree in 1932.

==Career==
From 1933 to 1937, De Lacy taught English at the University of Washington. He was among the professors accused of &quot;Communistic attitudes&quot; and was dismissed after a student, Thane Summers, volunteered in the Spanish Civil War and died in Spain. De Lacy was accused of encouraging students to fight for the Spanish Republicans.

De Lacy was elected to the Seattle City Council in 1937. He was subsequently elected as president of the Washington Commonwealth Federation, a left-wing faction within the Washington State Democratic Party that included a number of members of the Communist Party USA. He was re-elected and served on Seattle City Council until 1940.

As a congressman, De Lacy often expressed controversial views that earned him a reputation of a Communist fellow traveller. He attacked Patrick J. Hurley for his support of Chiang Kai-Shek instead of supporting &quot;the dynamic new democracy represented by the Chinese Communist Party&quot;. He was the only Washington delegate at the 1940 Democratic National Convention to oppose the re-nomination of President Roosevelt, calling him a &quot;warmonger&quot;. De Lacy spoke against conscription in 1940, but backed down and called for extending the draft in reaction to Operation Barbarossa in 1941. He also spoke in defense of prosecuted Communists such as Earl Browder and Harry Bridges.

Louis Budenz named De Lacy as a covert Communist in 1948. According to historian of American Communism Harvey Klehr, De Lacy was a secret member of the Communist Party USA at the time of his 1937 election.

De Lacy&#x27;s party membership was first publicly confirmed by the former Executive Secretary of the Washington Commonwealth Federation, Howard Costigan, who declared in sworn testimony delivered to the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1954 that he had sat with De Lacy on the governing bureau of the Seattle district of the CPUSA from 1937 to 1939.

De Lacy was elected to the United States Congress in 1944, replacing fellow Democrat Warren G. Magnuson who had retired from the House to run (successfully) for United States Senate. Harvey Klehr noted that by 1944, De Lacy moderated his political views and became &quot;once more a loyal New Dealer and won election to Congress for one term&quot;. De Lacy was defeated by Republican Homer Jones in the 1946 election.

In 1947, De Lacy became editor of the Bulletin of the Machinists&#x27; Union in Seattle. From 1948 to 1950, he was state director of the Progressive Party of Ohio and was active in the 1948 presidential campaign of Henry Wallace. He became a carpenter in 1951, and in 1960 he became a general building contractor. He retired from that role in 1967.

De Lacy and his Washington Commonwealth Federation held monthly community fundraisers they called hootenannies. They introduced folk singers Woody Guthrie, and Pete Seeger to the word when they came to visit Seattle in 1941, who went on to popularize it as term for a folk music jam.

==Personal life==
On October 24, 1947, De Lacy was divorced from Betty Jorgensen. In 1949, De Lacy married actress Hester Sondergaard; that marriage also ended in divorce. His third wife was Dorothy Baskin to whom he was married to from 1960 until his death. He had four daughters from his first marriage.

==Death==
On August 19, 1986, De Lacy died in Soquel, California after battling cancer for four years. He was buried in Home of Peace Cemetery in Santa Cruz, California.

<doc id="813995" wikidata="Q1331414" url="?curid=813995" title="Tel Quel">
<text>Tel Quel (translated into English as, variously: &quot;as is,&quot; &quot;as such,&quot; or &quot;unchanged&quot;) was a French avant-garde literary magazine published between 1960 and 1982.

==History and profile==
&quot;Tel Quel&quot; was founded in 1960 in Paris by Philippe Sollers and Jean-Edern Hallier and published by Éditions du Seuil. Important essays working towards post-structuralism and deconstruction appeared here. Publication ceased in 1982, and the journal was succeeded by &quot;L&#x27;Infini&quot; under Sollers&#x27;s continued editorship.

Though the journal originally published essays more in line with what current literary theory calls &quot;structuralism,&quot; it would eventually feature work that reflected the revaluation of literary, artistic, and music criticism that began in France in the 1960s.

The editors committee included Philippe Sollers, Jean-Edern Hallier, Jean-René Huguenin, Jean Ricardou, Jean Thibaudeau, Michel Deguy, Marcelin Pleynet, Denis Roche, Jean-Louis Baudry, Jean-Pierre Faye, Jacqueline Risset, François Wahl, and Julia Kristeva (married to Philippe Sollers since 1967).

Authors and collaborators include Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Maurice Blanchot, Pierre Boulez, Jacques Derrida, Jean Cayrol, Jean-Pierre Faye, Shoshana Felman 
In 1971 the journal broke with the French Communist Party and declared its support for Maoism. In 1974 the editorial members Philippe Sollers, Marcelin Pleynet, François Wahl, Roland Barthes and Julia Kristeva visited China. The trip, which was tightly organized by Chinese government officials, would later be processed in several essays and books by the participants. In the autumn of 1976 the journal explicitly distanced itself from Maoism.

&quot;Tel Quel&quot; featured a special section for terrorism in Italy in 1978, and Maria Antonietta Macciocchi and Leonardo Sciascia were among the contributors of the section.

<doc id="814023" wikidata="Q444183" url="?curid=814023" title="Erie Lackawanna Railway">
<text>The Erie Lackawanna Railway , known as the Erie Lackawanna Railroad until 1968, was formed from the 1960 merger of the Erie Railroad and the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad. The official motto of the line was &quot;The Friendly Service Route&quot;.
Like many railroads in the northeast already financially vulnerable from the expanding U.S. Interstate Highway System, the line was severely weakened fiscally by the extent, duration and record flood levels due to Hurricane Agnes in 1972. It would never recover. Most of the corporation&#x27;s holdings became part of Conrail in 1976, ending its sixteen years as an independent operating railroad company.

==History==
===Formation and early success===

The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the merger on Sept. 13, 1960, and on Oct. 17 the Erie Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad merged to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. 
The EL struggled for most of the 16 years it existed. The two railroads that created it were steadily losing passengers, freight traffic and money, and were heavily-burdened by years of accumulated debt and extensive, money-losing commuter operations. These two historic lines, the Erie and the DL&amp;W, started to consolidate facilities on the Hudson River waterfront and across southern New York State in 1956, four years before formal corporate merger. The Lackawanna route was severely affected by the decline of anthracite and cement traffic from Pennsylvania by the late 1940s. The Erie was burdened by the continuing loss of high-tariff fruit and vegetable traffic from the western states into the New York City region as highways improved in the 1950s. Both lines were also affected by the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959, which allowed ocean-going cargo ships to travel between European, African and South American ports and cities on the Great Lakes, such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Duluth, Chicago, etc. The DL&amp;W had previously carried much traffic to and from ocean ships, having its own port facilities at Hoboken Terminal on the Hudson River.

The northeast&#x27;s railroads, including the EL, were all beginning to decline because of over-regulation, subsidized highway and waterway competition, commuter operations and market saturation (i.e., too many railroad lines competing for what market was remaining). The closure in the 1960s of old multi-story factories in the eastern cities, followed by the decline of the domestic automobile and steel industry in the 1970s, eroded much of the EL&#x27;s traditional traffic base. Also, due to government regulation policy formulated in the late 19th century, the EL and other railroads could not immediately abandon long-distance passenger runs, despite the fact that competition from airlines, bus lines and the private automobile made them unprofitable.

However, the EL did post profits in the mid and late-1960s through heavy cost-cutting (reduction of parallel services), equipment modernization, suburban industrial development, increased piggy-back trailer traffic and steady reduction of long-distance passenger train service, which ended on January 6, 1970. Also, additional rail traffic was temporarily diverted to the EL because of service problems on the troubled Penn Central lines, which the EL largely paralleled. The EL built a state of the art diesel engine repair facility in Marion, Ohio, and upgraded a large car repair shop in Meadville, Pennsylvania. As to its money-losing suburban passenger train services in the New York City metropolitan region, the EL had come to terms with the state of New Jersey during the late 1960s for adequate subsidy and for the purchase of new engines and coaches. The EL also gained a lucrative contract with United Parcel Service in 1970, which led to the operation of five dedicated intermodal trains daily between New Jersey and Chicago.

===Decline and conveyance into Conrail===
The Erie Lackawanna Railway was formed on March 1, 1968, as a subsidiary of Dereco, the holding company of the Norfolk and Western Railway, which had bought the railroad. On April 1, the assets were transferred as a condition of the proposed but never-consummated merger between the N&amp;W and Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Dereco also owned the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway at the time.In 1972, Hurricane Agnes destroyed many miles of track and related assets, especially in northeastern Pennsylvania and New York State&#x27;s Southern Tier. The cost of repairs, and the loss of revenue, forced the company into bankruptcy, filing for reorganization under Section 77 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on June 26. The completion of the Interstate 80 highway across Pennsylvania and New Jersey by 1971 added to the Erie Lackawanna&#x27;s financial problems, as it diverted piggyback traffic previously garnered from less than truckload shipping companies such as Navajo and Cooper-Jarrett.

EL was able, however, to land large contracts with UPS because of its ability to move piggyback traffic between Chicago and the New York metropolitan area more reliably, although not faster than Penn Central (and formerly, New York Central). For example, in 1971, the Penn Central advertised a 24 and 1/2 hour piggyback service from Metro New York to Metro Chicago in the Official Guide of the Railways, while the EL&#x27;s Employees Timetable Number 3, New York Division, showed its fastest comparable schedule to be 28 hours and 45 minutes. By 1973, the Penn Central&#x27;s fastest piggyback service between these points was shown in the Official Guide to be 26 hours and 15 minutes, while the EL&#x27;s Employees Timetable Number 4 showed that the EL&#x27;s fastest comparable schedule was 29 and 1/2 hours.

After its 1972 bankruptcy, EL management attempted to plot an independent course, anticipating financial reorganization without a heavy debt burden. Therefore, it initially declined interest in joining the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) takeover of the other major bankrupt eastern lines. The preliminary (PSP) and final (FSP) system plans for Conrail showed the EL being merged into the Chessie System. Also, by 1975, the economy in the eastern United States was gravely affected by the 1973 oil crisis, quashing any hopes of the EL being able to independently compete with government-rehabilitated Conrail lines. Therefore, the EL petitioned and was accepted into Conrail at the last minute.

In 1976, much of the company&#x27;s railroad assets were thus purchased by the federal government and combined with other companies&#x27; railroad assets to form Conrail. An independent Erie Lackawanna Estate continued in existence for several years thereafter. This estate liquidated the EL&#x27;s marginal non-railroad assets and distributed the railroad purchase funds to satisfy much of the large debt burden that the EL and its predecessors had accumulated. The EL&#x27;s creditors gained more by selling the line&#x27;s assets than by continuing its traditional business operations.

===Remaining service today===
The Erie Lackawanna&#x27;s former commuter services are operated by NJ Transit and Metro-North; non-electrified service operates to and from Hoboken Terminal; electrified lines use both Hoboken Terminal and Pennsylvania Station as terminals. Metro-North and NJ Transit share operation of the Port Jervis and Pascack Valley Lines, while NJ Transit operates the Main, Montclair-Boonton, Morristown, Bergen County, and Gladstone Lines.

Track reconstruction is underway that could restore regular service along the Lackawanna Cut-Off from Port Morris Junction, New Jersey to the Pennsylvania border at the Delaware River (28.45 miles) and extend service into northeastern Pennsylvania, possibly as far as Scranton.

The Erie portion of the original Mainline between Port Jervis and Binghamton is operated by the CNYK. The Lackawanna Railroad mainline west of Portland is operated by the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad to Scranton; then by Norfolk Southern north to Binghamton. Norfolk Southern also operates from Binghamton to Buffalo on the Erie mainline, with the former Chicago mainline that heads west at Hornell operated by the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad. Most trackage in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois is a thing of the past.

==Operations==
===Noted passenger trains===
* Nos. 1 and 2, &quot;Phoebe Snow&quot;, New York (Hoboken)-Chicago; discontinued November 27–28, 1966.
* No. 7, &quot;Pacific Express&quot;, No. 8 the &quot;Atlantic Express&quot;; discontinued in August 1965.
* Nos. 5 and 6, &quot;Lake Cities&quot;, discontinued January 5–6, 1970.
* No. 10, &quot;New York Mail&quot;; No. 15, &quot;Owl&quot;; discontinued May 23, 1969.
* Nos. 28/29, Cleveland-Youngstown commuter trains; discontinued January 14, 1977. Though operated by Conrail after April 1976, they were the last remnant of EL passenger trains outside the New York-New Jersey commuter zone. These trains used the same EL locomotives and coaches formerly used on through mainline passenger trains.
* No. 40, &quot;Pocono Express&quot;; No. 43, &quot;Twilight,&quot; trains that made local stops throughout the resort Pocono Mountains region, discontinued Fall, 1965.
* Nos. 623, &quot;Morning Steel King,&quot; and 624, &quot;Evening Steel King,&quot; pool train with NYC, P&amp;LE and B&amp;O railroads, from Toledo to Washington, D.C., via Cleveland, Youngstown and Pittsburgh; discontinued by 1962.

==Heritage units==

In September 2015, Norfolk Southern revealed EMD SD45-2 1700, which had been painted back to its as-built Erie Lackawanna color scheme at Chattanooga, Tennessee. This is the second unit from an NS predecessor painted back into its original colors. In 2019, as part of its 40th anniversary, New Jersey Transit wrapped ALP-45DP 4519 and a Bombardier MultiLevel Coach into Erie Lackawanna colors.

<text>Homer Raymond Jones (September 3, 1893 – November 26, 1970) was an American politician and government official. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1947 to 1949, representing the First Congressional District of Washington as a Republican.

==Biography==
Jones was born in Martinsburg, Missouri on September 3, 1893, and his family moved to Bremerton, Washington in 1901. He attended the public schools of Bremerton and studied business administration at Seattle Business College. During World War I he served in the United States Navy, enlisting in 1917, and remaining in uniform until his 1919 discharge.

After the war, Jones was employed as a sheet metal worker at the Bremerton Navy Yard. A resident of Charleston, Washington, he served on the city council from 1922 to 1924, and as mayor from 1924 to 1927. (Charleston was consolidated with Bremerton in 1927.) Jones was Kitsap County Treasurer from 1926 to 1929, and Assistant Washington State Treasurer from 1929 to 1933. From 1933 to 1937, Jones was treasurer of Bremerton, and he served as Bremerton&#x27;s mayor from 1939 to 1941.

Jones served as state commander of the American Legion from 1934 to 1935. He received a commission in the United States Navy Reserve and was ordered to active duty for World War II; he served until the end of the war as a public affairs officer for the 13th Naval District, which was headquartered in Seattle. He was discharged as a captain in 1946, and his awards and decorations included the Bronze Star Medal.

In 1944, Jones was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for State Treasurer. In 1946, he was elected as a Republican to the 80th Congress (January 3, 1947 – January 3, 1949). He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1948 to the 81st first Congress. From 1949 to 1955, he was superintendent of the Washington State Veterans&#x27; Home in Retsil, and he served again as Assistant State Treasurer from 1953 to 1957.

Jones died in Bremerton on November 26, 1970, and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Bremerton.

Homer R. Jones Drive in Bremerton is named for him.

<doc id="814066" wikidata="Q1266775" url="?curid=814066" title="Matabeleland">
<text>Matabeleland is a region located in southwestern Zimbabwe that is divided into three provinces: Matabeleland North, Bulawayo, and Matabeleland South. These provinces are in the west and south-west of Zimbabwe, between the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers and are further separated from Midlands by the Shangani River in central Zimbabwe. The region is named after its inhabitants, the Ndebele people who were called &quot;Amatabele&quot;(people with long shields – Mzilikazi &#x27;s group of people who were escaping the Mfecani wars). Other ethnic groups who inhabit parts of Matabeleland include the Tonga, Bakalanga, Venda, Nambya, Khoisan, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, and Tsonga.

The capital and largest city is Bulawayo, other notable towns are Plumtree, Victoria Falls, Beitbridge, Lupane, Esigodini, Hwange Gwanda and Maphisa. The land is fertile but semi arid. This area has coal and gold deposits. Industries include gold and other mineral mines, and engineering. There has been a decline in the industries in this region as water is in short supply due to scarce rainfall. Promises by the government to draw water for the region through the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project have not been carried out, continuing water shortages.

== History ==
=== Rozvi Empire ===

Around the 10th and 11th centuries, the Bantu-speaking Bakalanga/vakaranga arrived from the south and settled in Mapungubwe on the Limpopo and Shashi river valleys. Later they moved north to Great Zimbabwe. By the 15th century, the Bakalanga/vakaranga had established a strong empire at Khami under a powerful ruler called Dlembeu. This empire was split by the end of the 15th century and were later conquered by the Nguni people.

=== Ndebele Kingdom ===

In the late 1830s, Mzilikazi Khumalo, led a group of Nguni and other ethnic groups from present-day South Africa into the Rozvi Empire of the Bakalanga. Many of the Bakalanga people were incorporated to create a large state called Ndebele Kingdom. Mzilikazi, a former general under Shaka, organised this ethnically diverse nation into a militaristic system of regimental towns and established his capital at Bulawayo (&quot;the place of killing&quot;). Mzilikazi was a statesman of considerable stature, able to weld the many conquered tribes into a strong, centralised kingdom.

In 1840, Matabeleland was founded.

In 1852, the Boer government in the Transvaal made a treaty with Mzilikazi. Gold was discovered in northern Ndebele in 1867. The area, settled by the Zezuru people, remnants of the Mwenemutapa kingdom, while the European powers increasingly became interested in the region. Mzilikazi died on 9 September 1868, near Bulawayo. His son, Lobengula, succeeded him as king. In exchange for wealth and arms, Lobengula granted several concessions to the British, but it was not until twenty years later that the most prominent of these, the 1888 Rudd Concession gave Cecil Rhodes exclusive mineral rights in much of the lands east of Lobengula&#x27;s main territory. Gold was already known to exist, but with the Rudd concession, Rhodes was able in 1889 to obtain a royal charter to form the British South Africa Company.

=== British South Africa Company ===

In 1890, Rhodes sent a group of settlers, known as the Pioneer Column, into Mashonaland where they founded Fort Salisbury (now Harare). In 1891 an Order-in-Council declared Matabeleland and Mashonaland British protectorates. Rhodes had a vested interest in the continued expansion of white settlements in the region, so now with the cover of a legal mandate, he used a brutal attack by Ndebele against the Shona near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo) in 1893 as a pretext for attacking the kingdom of Lobengula. Also in 1893, a concession awarded to Sir John Swinburne was detached from Matabeleland to be administered by the British Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, to which the territory was formally annexed in 1911 and it remains part of modern Botswana, known as the Tati Concessions Land.

=== First Matabele War ===
The first decisive battle was fought on 1 November 1893, when a laager was attacked on open ground near the Bembesi River by Imbizo and Ingubo regiments. The laager consisted of 670 British soldiers, 400 of whom were mounted along with a small force of native allies, and fought off the Imbizo and Ingubo forces, which were considered by Sir John Willoughby to number 1,700 warriors in all. The laager had with it small artillery: 5 Maxim guns, 2 seven-pounders, 1 Gardner gun, and 1 Hotchkiss gun. The Maxim machine guns took center stage and decimated the native force at the Battle of the Shangani.

Although Lobengula&#x27;s forces totaled 8,000 spearmen and 2,000 riflemen, versus fewer than 700 soldiers of the British South Africa Police, the Ndebele warriors were not equipped to match the British machine guns. Leander Starr Jameson sent his troops to Bulawayo to try to capture Lobengula, but the king escaped and left Bulawayo in ruins behind him.

An attempt to bring the king and his forces to submit led to the disaster of the Shangani Patrol when a Ndebele Impi defeated a British South Africa Company patrol led by Major Allan Wilson at the Shangani river in December 1893. Except for Frederick Russell Burnham and two other scouts sent for reinforcements, the detachment was surrounded and wiped out. This incident had a lasting influence on Matabeleland nationalism and spirit of resistance and the colonists who died in this battle are buried at Matobo Hills along with Jameson and Cecil Rhodes. In white Rhodesian history, Wilson&#x27;s battle takes on the status of General Custer&#x27;s stand at Little Big Horn in the United States. The Matabele fighters honoured the dead men with a salute to their bravery in battle and reportedly told the king, &quot;They were men of men and their fathers were men before them.&quot;

Lobengula died in January 1894, under mysterious circumstances; within a few short months the British South Africa Company controlled Matabeleland, and white settlers continued to arrive.

=== Second Matebele War ===

In March 1896, the Ndebele revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company in what is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First Chimurenga, i.e., First War of Independence. Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual/religious leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. He convinced the Ndebele that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time.

Mlimo&#x27;s call to battle was well-timed. Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company&#x27;s Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the ill-fated Jameson Raid. This left the country&#x27;s security in disarray. In June 1896, the Shona too joined the war, but they stayed mostly on the defensive. The British would immediately send troops to suppress the Ndebele and the Shona, only it would take months and cost many hundreds of lives before the territory would be once again be at peace. Shortly after learning of the assassination of Mlimo at the hands of the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, thus bringing the war to a close in October 1896. Matabeleland and Mashonaland would continue on only as provinces of the larger state of Rhodesia.

=== Birthplace of Scouting ===

It was in Matabeleland during the Second Matabele War that Robert Baden-Powell, who later became the founder of the Scout Movement, and the younger Frederick Russell Burnham, the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army, first met and began their lifelong friendship. Baden-Powell had already, in 1884, published a book called &quot;Reconnaissance and Scouting&quot;. In mid-June 1896, while scouting in the Matobo Hills, Burnham passed on to Baden-Powell aspects of woodcraft he had acquired in America, and it was during this time with Burnham that perhaps the seeds were sown for the program and the code of honour eventually crystallised in Baden-Powell&#x27;s 1899 &quot;Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men&quot; and his later (1908) &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, which was written after his experience of how useful and reliable the boys at Mafeking had been. Practiced by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally unknown to the British. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called &quot;scoutcraft&quot;, the fundamentals of Scouting. Baden-Powell recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during these scouting missions in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham. Later, Baden-Powell wrote a number of books on Scouting, and even started to train and make use of adolescent boys, most famously during the Siege of Mafeking, during the Second Boer War.

=== British Rule ===

British settlement of Rhodesia continued, and by October 1923, the territory of Southern Rhodesia was annexed to the Crown. The Ndebele thereby became British subjects and the colony received its first basic constitution and first parliamentary election. Ten years later, the British South Africa Company ceded its mineral rights to the territory&#x27;s government for £2 million. The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom of British immigration.

After the onset of self-government, a major issue in Southern Rhodesia was the relationship between the white settlers and the Ndebele and Shona populations. One major consequence was the white settlers were able to enact discriminatory legislation concerning land tenure. The Land Apportionment and Tenure Acts reserved 45% of the land area for exclusively white ownership. 25% was designated &quot;Tribal Trust Land&quot;, which was available to be worked on a collective basis by the already settled farmers and where individual title was not offered.

In 1965, the white government of Rhodesia, led by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain – only the second state to do so, the other being the United States in 1776. Initially, the state proclaimed its loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as &quot;Queen of Rhodesia&quot; (a title to which she never consented), but by 1970 even that link was severed, and Rhodesia claimed to be an independent republic. This was not recognised by any other state in the world; legally, Rhodesia remained a British colony.

=== Sovereign Rhodesia ===

The ruling white Rhodesian government did not gain international recognition and faced serious economic problems as a result of sanctions. Some states, such as South Africa and Portugal, did support the white minority government of Rhodesia. In 1967, the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union began a lengthy armed campaign against Rhodesia&#x27;s white minority government in what became known as the &quot;Bush War&quot; by White Rhodesians and as the &quot;Second &quot;Umvukela&quot;&quot; (or &quot;rebellion&quot; in Ndebele language) by supporters of the rebels. The Shona, backed by China, set up a separate war front from neighbouring Mozambique.

The Rhodesian government agreed to a ceasefire in 1979. For a brief period, Rhodesia reverted to the status of British colony, until early 1980 when elections were held. The ZANU party, led by the Shona independence leader Robert Mugabe, defeated the popular Ndebele candidate Joshua Nkomo, solidified their rule over independent Zimbabwe. The former state of Matabeleland and Mashonaland now exist as provinces of Zimbabwe.

=== Zimbabwe ===

Following independence in 1980, Zimbabwe initially made significant economic and social progress,

=== Gukurahundi Massacre 1983-87 ===
Gukurahundi was a series of alleged massacres of people inhabiting areas largely populated by Northern Ndebele people (formerly known as Matabele). They are said to have been carried out by some military elements mainly alleged to be a now disbanded fifth brigade, a paramilitary force that was trained in North Korea, from early 1983 to late 1987. The International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates that more than 20,000 people were killed and have classified the massacres as a genocide. The government has repeatedly destroyed local plaques commemorating the massacres.

By early 1984, these military elements are alleged to have disrupted food supplies in the Matabeleland regions where some inhabitants in the affected areas suffered food shortages. Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo finally reconciled their political differences by late 1987. The roots of discord remained, however, and in some ways increased as Mugabe&#x27;s rule became increasingly autocratic into the 21st century.

In the early 1990s, a Land Acquisition Act was passed, calling for the Mugabe government to purchase mostly white-owned commercial farming land for redistribution to native Africans. Greater Matabeleland has rich central plains, watered by tributaries of the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, allowing it to sustain cattle and consistently produce large amounts of cotton and maize. But land grabbing, squatting, and repossessions of large commercial farms under Mugabe&#x27;s program resulted in a 90% loss in productivity in large-scale farming, ever higher unemployment, and hyperinflation.

<text>Robert Nelson Cornelius Nix Sr. (August 9, 1898 – June 22, 1987) was an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1958 until 1979. He was the first African American to represent Pennsylvania in the House of Representatives. The Robert N. C. Nix Federal Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is named in his honor.

==Early life==
Born in Orangeburg, South Carolina, he attended Townsend Harris High School in New York City and graduated from Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) in 1921. He received his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and began practicing in Philadelphia. After entering private practice, Nix became active in the Democratic Party as a committeeman from the fourth ward in 1932. He became a special assistant deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania in 1934 and delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention.

==United States House of Representatives==
In 1958, he defeated two opponents in a special election to fill a congressional vacancy left by Earl Chudoff in the House of Representatives. An elected official who rarely wanted or attracted widespread publicity, he supported mostly liberal legislation. He was reelected 10 times. He worked for the passage of the landmark legislation promoting the American Civil Rights Movement and privately sought to prevent the House from denying Rep. Adam Clayton Powell his seat in 1967. In 1962, he became the first member of congress to knowingly meet with gay activists, when he invited Frank Kameny to his office. In 1975, he introduced an amendment to the Foreign Military Sales Act requiring the Defense Department to provide the U.S. Congress with information on identities of agents who negotiate arms sales for American firms.

===Committee service===
Congressman Nix served on the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. He was the chairman of the Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service and the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy. Congressman Nix served 20 years before losing to William H. Gray III in the primary in 1978.

==Family==
Congressman Nix&#x27;s son, Robert N. C. Nix Jr., became the first African American to be elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania when he was elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

==Legacy==

In 1985, the United States court house and post office building in Philadelphia was renamed the Robert N. C. Nix Sr. Federal Building and United States Post Office in honor of Nix.

<text>The centavo (Spanish and Portuguese &#x27;one hundredth&#x27;) is a fractional monetary unit that represents one hundredth of a basic monetary unit in many countries around the world. The term comes from Latin &quot;centum&quot; (), with the added suffix &quot;-avo&quot; (&#x27;portion&#x27;).

<doc id="814148" wikidata="Q7140394" url="?curid=814148" title="Partial trace">
<text>In linear algebra and functional analysis, the partial trace is a generalization of the trace. Whereas the trace is a scalar-valued function on operators, the partial trace is an operator-valued function. The partial trace has applications in quantum information and decoherence which is relevant for quantum measurement and thereby to the decoherent approaches to interpretations of quantum mechanics, including consistent histories and the relative state interpretation.

== Details ==
Suppose formula_1, formula_2 are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field, with dimensions formula_3 and formula_4, respectively. For any space , let formula_5 denote the space of linear operators on formula_6. The partial trace over formula_2 is then written as , where formula_8 denotes the Kronecker product.

It is defined as follows: 
For , let , and , be bases for &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively; then &quot;T&quot; has a matrix representation
: formula_9
relative to the basis formula_10 of formula_11.

Now for indices &quot;k&quot;, &quot;i&quot; in the range 1, ..., &quot;m&quot;, consider the sum
: formula_12

This gives a matrix &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;i&quot;. The associated linear operator on &quot;V&quot; is independent of the choice of bases and is by definition the partial trace.

Among physicists, this is often called &quot;tracing out&quot; or &quot;tracing over&quot; &quot;W&quot; to leave only an operator on &quot;V&quot; in the context where &quot;W&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are Hilbert spaces associated with quantum systems (see below).

=== Invariant definition ===
The partial trace operator can be defined invariantly (that is, without reference to a basis) as follows: it is the unique linear map 
: formula_13 
such that
: formula_14
To see that the conditions above determine the partial trace uniquely, let formula_15 form a basis for formula_1, let formula_17 form a basis for formula_2, let formula_19 be the map that sends formula_20 to formula_21 (and all other basis elements to zero), and let formula_22 be the map that sends formula_23 to Since the vectors formula_24 form a basis for formula_25, the maps formula_26 form a basis for 

From this abstract definition, the following properties follow:
: formula_27
: formula_28

=== Category theoretic notion ===

It is the partial trace of linear transformations that is the subject of Joyal, Street, and Verity&#x27;s notion of Traced monoidal category. A traced monoidal category is a monoidal category formula_29 together with, for objects &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot; in the category, a function of Hom-sets,
: formula_30
satisfying certain axioms.

Another case of this abstract notion of partial trace takes place in the category of finite sets and bijections between them, in which the monoidal product is disjoint union. One can show that for any finite sets, &quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;U&quot; and bijection formula_31 there exists a corresponding &quot;partially traced&quot; bijection 

== Partial trace for operators on Hilbert spaces ==

The partial trace generalizes to operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Suppose &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; are Hilbert spaces, and 
let
: formula_32
be an orthonormal basis for &quot;W&quot;. Now there is an isometric isomorphism
: formula_33

Under this decomposition, any operator formula_34 can be regarded as an infinite matrix
of operators on &quot;V&quot;
: formula_35
where formula_36.

First suppose &quot;T&quot; is a non-negative operator. In this case, all the diagonal entries of the above matrix are non-negative operators on &quot;V&quot;. If the sum
: formula_37
converges in the strong operator topology of L(&quot;V&quot;), it is independent of the chosen basis of &quot;W&quot;. The partial trace Tr&quot;W&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is defined to be this operator. The partial trace of a self-adjoint operator is defined if and only if the partial traces of the positive and negative parts are defined.

=== Computing the partial trace ===

Suppose &quot;W&quot; has an orthonormal basis, which we denote by ket vector notation as . Then
: formula_38

The superscripts in parentheses do not represent matrix components, but instead label the matrix itself.

== Partial trace and invariant integration ==

In the case of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, there is a useful way of looking at partial trace involving integration with respect to a suitably normalized Haar measure μ over the unitary group U(&quot;W&quot;) of &quot;W&quot;. Suitably normalized means that &quot;μ&quot; is taken to be a measure with total mass dim(&quot;W&quot;).

Theorem. Suppose &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; are finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Then
: formula_39
commutes with all operators of the form formula_40 and hence is uniquely of the form formula_41. The operator &quot;R&quot; is the partial trace of &quot;T&quot;.

== Partial trace as a quantum operation ==

The partial trace can be viewed as a quantum operation. Consider a quantum mechanical system whose state space is the tensor product formula_42 of Hilbert spaces. A mixed state is described by a density matrix &quot;ρ&quot;, that is 
a non-negative trace-class operator of trace 1 on the tensor product formula_43
The partial trace of &quot;ρ&quot; with respect to the system &quot;B&quot;, denoted by formula_44, is called the reduced state of &quot;ρ&quot; on system &quot;A&quot;. In symbols,
formula_45

To show that this is indeed a sensible way to assign a state on the &quot;A&quot; subsystem to ρ, we offer the following justification. Let &quot;M&quot; be an observable on the subsystem &quot;A&quot;, then the corresponding observable on the composite system is formula_46. However one chooses to define a reduced state formula_47, there should be consistency of measurement statistics. The expectation value of &quot;M&quot; after the subsystem &quot;A&quot; is prepared in formula_44 and that of formula_46 when the composite system is prepared in ρ should be the same, i.e. the following equality should hold:
: formula_50

We see that this is satisfied if formula_44 is as defined above via the partial trace. Furthermore, such operation is unique.

Let &quot;T&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) be the Banach space of trace-class operators on the Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;. It can be easily checked that the partial trace, viewed as a map 
: formula_52
is completely positive and trace-preserving.

The density matrix ρ is Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and has a trace of 1. It has a spectral decomposition:
: formula_53

Its easy to see that the partial trace formula_44 also satisfies these conditions. For example, for any pure state formula_55 in formula_56, we have
: formula_57
Note that the term formula_58 represents the probability of finding the state formula_55 when the composite system is in the state formula_60. This proves the positive semi-definiteness of formula_44.

The partial trace map as given above induces a dual map formula_62 between the C*-algebras of bounded operators on formula_63 and formula_42 given by
: formula_65
formula_62 maps observables to observables and is the Heisenberg picture representation of .

=== Comparison with classical case ===

Suppose instead of quantum mechanical systems, the two systems &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are classical. The space of observables for each system are then abelian C*-algebras. These are of the form &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and &quot;C&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) respectively for compact spaces &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;. The state space of the composite system is simply
: formula_67

A state on the composite system is a positive element &quot;ρ&quot; of the dual of C(&quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot;), which by the Riesz–Markov theorem corresponds to a regular Borel measure on &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot;. The corresponding reduced state is obtained by projecting the measure &quot;ρ&quot; to &quot;X&quot;. Thus the partial trace is the quantum mechanical equivalent of this operation.

<doc id="814180" wikidata="Q593533" url="?curid=814180" title="Don Siegelman">
<text>Donald Eugene Siegelman ( ; born February 24, 1946) is an American politician who was the 51st governor of Alabama from 1999 to 2003. To date, Siegelman is the last Democrat as well as the only Catholic to serve as Governor of Alabama.

Siegelman is the only person in Alabama&#x27;s history to be elected to serve in all four of the top statewide elected offices: Secretary of State, Attorney General, Lieutenant Governor, and Governor. He served in Alabama politics for 26 years.

In 2006, Siegelman was convicted on federal felony corruption charges and sentenced to seven years in federal prison. Following the trial, however, many questions were raised by both Democrats and Republicans about allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in his case. On March 6, 2009, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld key bribery, conspiracy, and obstruction counts against Siegelman and refused his request for a new trial.

In October 2015, more than 100 former attorneys general and officials, both Democratic and Republican, contended that his prosecution was marred by prosecutorial misconduct; they have petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review the case. Siegelman was released from prison on February 8, 2017, and was on supervised probation until June 2019.

== Personal life and early career ==
Siegelman was born and raised in Mobile, Alabama, the son of Catherine Andrea (née Schottgen) and Leslie Bouchet Siegelman, and raised in the Catholic faith.

He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Alabama, where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Psi chapter), in 1968. Siegelman served in the Air National Guard for 19 months as a fuel handler and fuel truck driver, and was discharged for medical reasons in 1969. In his 1994 campaign for lieutenant governor, Republican Charles Graddick argued that Siegelman had been discharged as the result of mental health issues. Siegelman stated that he had received an honorable discharge as the result of several physical symptoms including high blood pressure, high pulse rate, headaches, and dizziness that were attributed to stress over family concerns including the illness of his father.

He earned a J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., in 1972. He studied international law at Pembroke College, Oxford from 1972 to 1973.

While at the University of Alabama, Siegelman served as the president of the student government association. While in law school, Siegelman worked as an officer in the United States Capitol Police to support himself.

Siegelman married Lori Allen, and they have two children, Dana and Joseph. His wife is Jewish and they reared their children in the Jewish faith.

His son, Joseph, was the Democratic nominee for Attorney General of Alabama in the 2018 election, losing to incumbent Steve Marshall.

==Political career==

After college and graduate school, Siegelman became active in the Democratic Party in Alabama. In 1978, he was elected Secretary of State of Alabama. He served two terms as Secretary of State, from 1979 to 1987.

He was elected as Alabama&#x27;s Attorney General in 1986, serving from 1987 to 1991. He ran for Governor in 1990 but lost in the Democratic primary runoff to Paul Hubbert, the executive secretary of the Alabama Education Association. Siegelman was elected as Lieutenant Governor in 1994, serving from 1995 to 1999.

In 1998, Siegelman was elected Governor with 57% of the vote, including more than 90% of the African American electorate. He was the first native Mobilian to be elected to the state&#x27;s highest office. By that time, following passage by Congress in the mid-1960s of civil rights legislation, most African Americans in the South supported Democratic Party statewide and national candidates.

In 1988 as state Attorney General, Siegelman addressed the Alabama Chemical Association and met with Monsanto lobbyists. The state gave permission for Monsanto to direct their own cleanup of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) at their plant in Anniston, Alabama. The waterways of the town had been polluted by PCBs from the plant. This work has been strongly criticized as inadequate. For instance, Monsanto dredged PCBs from just a few hundred yards of Snow Creek and its tributaries.

==Governorship==
Siegelman&#x27;s term as Governor took place during, and contributed to, the dramatic growth in Alabama&#x27;s automotive manufacturing industry. Mercedes-Benz had built the first new major automotive plant during the administration of Governor Jim Folsom Jr. During Siegelman&#x27;s administration, Mercedes agreed to double the size of that plant.

Siegelman worked to recruit other manufacturers, visiting several countries and securing commitments from Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai to build major assembly plants in Alabama.

Siegelman presided over eight executions (seven by electric chair, one by lethal injection), including that of Lynda Lyon Block, the first female executed in the state since 1957. He also oversaw the transition from electrocution as a sole method to lethal injection as the primary method.

=== State lottery and universal education ===
Siegelman had campaigned for voter approval of a state lottery. The proceeds were to be earmarked to fund free tuition at state universities for most high school graduates. Siegelman supported a bill that placed the lottery on a free-standing referendum ballot in 1999. The measure was defeated. Some advisors had suggested that Siegelman wait until the regular 2000 elections, when anti-gambling interests would command a smaller percentage of the electorate.

After the defeat of the lottery, Siegelman struggled to deal with serious state budget problems. Alabama&#x27;s tax revenues were down during most of his administration. Observers believed that Siegelman did a decent job of managing the limited revenue produced by this system during a national economic downturn.

Siegelman launched the &quot;Alabama Reading Initiative&quot;, an early education literacy program that was praised by both Democratic and Republican officials. It has been emulated by several other states.

==2002 election controversy==
U.S. Representative Bob Riley defeated Siegelman in his November 2002 reelection bid by the narrowest margin in Alabama history: approximately 3,000 votes.

On the night of the election, Siegelman was initially declared the winner by the Associated Press. Later, a voting machine malfunction in Baldwin County was claimed to have produced the votes needed to give Riley the election.

Democratic Party officials objected, stating that the recount had been performed by local Republican election officials after Democratic observers had left the site of the vote counting. This rendered verification of the recount results impossible. The state&#x27;s Attorney General, Republican Bill Pryor, affirmed the recounted vote totals, securing Riley&#x27;s election. Pryor denied requests for a manual recount of the disputed vote; he warned that opening the sealed votes to recount them would be held a criminal offense.

Analysts said that perhaps the most objective observation about this purported vote shift was that there was no corresponding vote shift in other issues and candidates on these same ballots, a shift that would be expected if they were anti-Siegelman voters. Largely as a result of this obvious inconsistency, the Alabama Legislature amended the election code to provide for automatic, supervised recounts in close races.

==2006 election==
Siegelman ran to become the Democratic nominee for the 2006 Alabama gubernatorial election; however, he was defeated in the primary by Lt. Governor Lucy Baxley, former wife of the controversial 1986 gubernatorial nominee, former attorney general and lieutenant governor Bill Baxley. In large part because of Siegelman&#x27;s indictment for bribery and racketeering, Baxley was able to secure important endorsements from the Alabama Democratic Conference, the New South Coalition, and the Alabama State Employees Association. Although outspent by Siegelman, and criticized on her call for a raise of the state&#x27;s minimum wage by $1, Baxley coasted to a relatively easy primary win of 60% to Siegelman&#x27;s 36%. She lost the general election for governor later that year to Republican Bob Riley, 42-58 percent.

==Federal prosecution==
===2004 trial===
On May 27, 2004, Siegelman was indicted by the federal government for fraud. The day after his trial began in October 2004, prosecutors dropped all charges after U.S. District Judge U. W. Clemon had thrown out much of the prosecution&#x27;s evidence, stating that no new charges could be refiled based on the disallowed evidence.

===2006 conviction===
On October 26, 2005, Siegelman was indicted on new charges of bribery and mail fraud in connection with Richard M. Scrushy, founder and former CEO of HealthSouth. Two former Siegelman aides were charged in the indictment as well. Siegelman was accused of trading government favors for campaign donations as Lieutenant Governor from 1995 to 1999, and as Governor from 1999 to 2003.

Scrushy was accused of arranging $500,000 in donations to Siegelman&#x27;s 1999 campaign for a state lottery fund for universal education, in exchange for a seat on a state hospital regulatory board, a non-paying position. Scrushy had been appointed and served on the state hospital regulatory board during the past three Republican administrations. He had been acquitted in 2005 of charges of securities fraud for his part in the HealthSouth Corporation fraud scandal which cost shareholders billions.

During his trial, Siegelman continued his campaign for reelection, running in the Democratic primary against Lt. Governor Lucy Baxley and minor candidates. On June 6, despite Baxley&#x27;s relatively low-profile campaign, she defeated Siegelman with almost 60% of the vote compared to Siegelman&#x27;s 36%.

On June 29, 2006, three weeks after Siegelman lost the primary, a federal jury found both Siegelman and Scrushy guilty on seven of the 33 felony counts in the indictment. Two co-defendants, Siegelman&#x27;s former chief of staff, Paul Hamrick and his transportation director, Mack Roberts, were acquitted of all charges. Siegelman was convicted on one count of bribery, one count of conspiracy to commit honest services mail fraud, four counts of honest services mail fraud, and one count of obstruction of justice.

Siegelman was acquitted on 25 counts, including the indictment&#x27;s allegations of a widespread RICO conspiracy. Siegelman was represented by Mobile attorneys Vince Kilborn and David McDonald, along with Greenwood attorney Hiram Eastland and Notre Dame law professor G. Robert Blakey, an authority on RICO. Siegelman was sentenced by Judge Mark Everett Fuller, a George W. Bush appointee, to more than seven years in federal prison and a $50,000 fine.

Siegelman said in his defense that Scrushy had been on the regulatory board of the state hospital during several preceding Republican governorships. He said that Scrushy&#x27;s contribution toward the campaign for a state lottery fund for universal education was unrelated to his appointment. Siegelman and his attorneys said that the charges against him, in addition to being unfounded, were without precedent.

Scrushy was released from federal prison in April 2012. He resided in a Houston, Texas halfway house until he was released on July 25, 2012.

====Release from federal prison====

On Thursday, March 27, 2008, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved Siegelman&#x27;s release from federal prison while he appealed his conviction in the corruption case. He was released the following day. The federal court approved the release of Siegelman on bail.

Siegelman told the Democratic National Committee that he believed Karl Rove should be held in contempt for refusing to testify before the House committee that investigated Siegelman&#x27;s conviction. No action against Rove was taken.

===2009 appeal===
On March 6, 2009, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld key bribery, conspiracy and obstruction counts against Siegelman and refused his request for a new trial. It found no evidence that the conviction was unjust. However, the Court struck down two of the seven charges on which Siegelman was convicted and ordered a new sentencing hearing. His sentence was reduced by 10 months, leaving him with 69 months.

===2014 appeal===
After several delays requested by Siegelman, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard Siegelman&#x27;s appeal for a new trial in May 2015. Arguments had originally been expected in October 2014. The Court upheld the decision of a lower court to deny appeal.

===Appeal issues===

Witness Nick Bailey, who provided the cornerstone testimony upon which the conviction was based, was subsequently convicted of extortion. Facing 10 years in prison, Bailey had cooperated with prosecutors to lighten his own sentence. Although he engaged in more than 70 interviews with the prosecution against Siegelman, none of the notes detailing these interviews was shared with the defense. In addition, after the case was tried, it was confirmed that the check which Bailey testified to seeing Scrushy write for Siegelman, was written days later, when he was not present.

===Juror partiality===
Documents indicated that prosecutors interviewed two jurors while the court was reviewing charges of juror misconduct. This was in violation of the judge&#x27;s instruction that no contact with jurors should occur without his permission.

===Karl Rove connection===
There were allegations that Siegelman&#x27;s prosecution was politically motivated. Purportedly, Bush-appointed officials at the Justice Department had pressed for the prosecution, as did Leura Canary, a U.S. Attorney in Montgomery, Alabama. Her husband was Alabama&#x27;s top Republican operative and he had for years worked closely with Karl Rove, part of the George W. Bush White House staff.

In June 2006, a Republican lawyer, Dana Jill Simpson of Rainsville, Alabama, signed an affidavit, claiming that, five years earlier, she had heard that Rove was preparing to neutralize Siegelman politically with an investigation headed by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Simpson later told &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; that her affidavit&#x27;s wording could be interpreted in two ways. She said she had written her affidavit herself. But, in testimony before a Congressional committee on this case, she said that she had help on it from a Siegelman supporter.

According to Simpson&#x27;s statement, she was on a Republican campaign conference call in 2002 when she heard Bill Canary tell other campaign workers not to worry about Siegelman. He said that Canary&#x27;s &quot;girls&quot; and &quot;Karl&quot; would make sure the Justice Department pursued the Democrat so he was not a political threat in the future.

&quot;Canary&#x27;s girls&quot; supposedly included his wife, Leaura Canary, US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama, and Alice Martin, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. Leaura Canary did not submit voluntary recusal paperwork until two months after Siegelman attorney David Cromwell Johnson&#x27;s press conference in March 2002, at which he criticized her participation because of her husband&#x27;s political role.

In interviews with the press, Simpson has reiterated that she heard Rove&#x27;s name mentioned in a phone conversation in which the discussion turned to Siegelman. She clarified that she heard someone involved in a 2002 conference call refer to a meeting between Rove and Justice Department officials on the subject of Siegelman, and revealed that Rove directed her to &quot;catch Siegelman cheating on his wife&quot;.

&quot;Raw Story&quot; reported in 2007 that Rove had advised Bill Canary on managing Republican Bob Riley&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign against Siegelman, including during the election fraud controversy of 2002. This was based on the testimony of &quot;two Republican lawyers who have asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation&quot;, one of whom is close to Alabama&#x27;s Republican National Committee.

Simpson&#x27;s house burned down soon after she began to speak out about the Siegelman case. She claimed her car was forced off the road by a private investigator and wrecked but police investigations of the fire and the wreck found no evidence of foul play. Simpson said, &quot;Anytime you speak truth to power, there are great risks. I&#x27;ve been attacked.&quot; She told a reporter for &quot;The Nation&quot; that she felt a &quot;moral obligation&quot; to speak up.

===Alleged misconduct by attorney general===

In November 2008, new documents revealed alleged misconduct by the Bush-appointed U.S. attorney and other prosecutors in the Siegelman/Scrushy case. There were allegations that extensive and unusual contact occurred between the prosecution and the jury. According to &quot;Time&quot;, a Department of Justice staffer furnished the new documents at the risk of losing her job. The documents included e-mails written by Leura Canary, long after her recusal, offering legal advice to subordinates handling the case. At the time Canary wrote the e-mails, her husband was publicly supporting the state&#x27;s Republican governor, Bob Riley. In one of Leura Canary&#x27;s e-mails made public by &quot;Time&quot;, dated September 19, 2005, she forwarded senior prosecutors on the Siegelman case a three-page political commentary by Siegelman.

Canary highlighted a single passage, telling her subordinates,

Y&#x27;all need to read, because he refers to a &#x27;survey&#x27; which allegedly shows that 67% of Alabamians believe the investigation of him to be politically motivated ... Perhaps [this is] grounds not to let [Siegelman] discuss court activities in the media!

At Siegelman&#x27;s sentencing, the prosecutors urged the judge to use these public statements by Siegelman as grounds for increasing his prison sentence.

===Public reaction===
In July 2007, 44 former state attorneys general, both Democrats and Republicans, filed a petition to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees requesting further investigation of the Siegelman prosecution.

On July 17, 2007, House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D, MI-14) and Reps. Linda Sánchez (D, CA-39), Artur Davis (D, AL-07), and Tammy Baldwin (D, WI-02) sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, asking him to provide documents and information about former Alabama Democratic Governor Don Siegelman&#x27;s recent conviction, among others, that may have been part of a pattern of selective political prosecutions by a number of U.S. Attorneys across the country. The deadline for the Attorney General&#x27;s office to provide the information to Congress was July 27, 2007. The documents had not been produced by August 28, 2007, when Gonzales announced that he would resign. In an editorial that day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that despite Gonzales&#x27; departure, &quot;[M]any questions remain to be answered. High on the list: what role politics played in dubious prosecutions, like those of former Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama, and Georgia Thompson, a Wisconsin civil servant.&quot; 
Press reports have suggested that perhaps U.S. Attorney Leura Canary did not follow proper Department of Justice procedures in recusing herself from the Siegelman matter. There were no court filings to that effect and DOJ refused to disclose her recusal form under a Freedom of Information Act inquiry.

On October 10, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee released testimony in which Dana Jill Simpson alleged that Karl Rove &quot;had spoken with the Department of Justice&quot; about &quot;pursuing&quot; Siegelman with help from two of Alabama&#x27;s U.S. attorneys, and that Governor Bob Riley had named the judge who was eventually assigned to the case. She also claimed that Riley told her the judge would &quot;hang Don Siegelman.&quot; In contrast with what she told &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, in her sworn testimony before Congress, she never mentioned having met or spoken with Rove.

===Wider public===

Siegelman defenders note that more than 100 federal charges were thrown out by three different judges. Further, they argue that there was an obvious conflict of interest in the prosecution against Siegelman, since the investigating U.S. Attorney was married to the campaign manager of his political opponent in the 2002 gubernatorial campaign. Siegelman defenders argue that the sentence is unprecedented and the punishment excessive. By contrast, former Alabama Governor H. Guy Hunt, a Republican, was found guilty in state court of personally pocketing $200,000. State prosecutors sought probation, not jail time, in the Hunt case.

===Federal Communications Commission investigation===

&quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired an investigative segment on the case, &quot;The Prosecution of Governor Siegelman&quot;, on February 24, 2008.

During the broadcast, CBS affiliate WHNT-TV in Huntsville, Alabama, did not air this segment of the program, claiming technical issues with the signal.

Journalist and attorney Scott Horton of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; has stated that he contacted CBS News in New York regarding the issue. He said that representatives there said there were no transmission issues, and that WHNT had functioning transmitters at the time.

Horton accused WHNT of a history of political hostility toward Siegelman. The station responded to the controversy by rebroadcasting the report later that night, and again the next day.

In March 2008, the Federal Communications Commission began an investigation into why the north Alabama television station went dark during the February 24, 2008 broadcast of the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; installment. The investigation resulted in no action.

===Sentencing===
On August 3, 2012, Siegelman was sentenced to more than six years in prison, a $50,000 fine, and 500 hours of community service. Siegelman was credited with time served, leaving 5 years, nine months remaining in his sentence. His daughter, Dana, initiated an online petition requesting a presidential pardon for Siegelman. At the re-sentencing, the judge told Siegelman that he did not hold this against him personally and wished him well with his sentence. The judge gave Siegelman until September 11 to report to prison. Richard Scrushy had not been released on bail, and has since served all his time.

Siegelman was released from prison on supervised probation on February 8, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alabama News 02/17&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Siegelman&#x27;s case was the subject of a 2017 documentary entitled &quot;Atticus v. The Architect: The Political Assassination of Don Siegelman&quot;, written and directed by Steve Wimberly.

<text>Forrest Hood &quot;Fob&quot; James Jr. (born September 15, 1934) is an American politician, civil engineer, entrepreneur, and former football player. He served as the 48th governor of Alabama, first as a Democrat from 1979–1983, and then as a Republican from 1995 to 1999.

==Education, football, and early career==

James was born in Lanett, Alabama, the son of Rebecca (née Ellington) James (1907 - 1999) and Forrest Hood James (1905 - 1973). Named after his father, James was nicknamed &quot;Fob&quot; as a boy. His maternal grandparents were Calvin Sidney Ellington (1871 - 1958) and Sue Reese Robertson (1872 - 1959). They married in 1904. Calvin, known by his nickname of &quot;Cal&quot; was a commercial traveler who sold dry goods. In addition, he was also a farmer. Calvin died on November 1, 1958 at the age of 87, and Sue died the next year on October 2, 1959, also at the age of 87. Calvin and Sue were buried at Rosemere Cemetery in Opelika, Lee County, Alabama.

After graduation in 1952 from Baylor School, a private high school in Chattanooga, Tennessee, James entered Auburn University, where he played football for head coach Ralph &quot;Shug&quot; Jordan. In 1955 James was named All-American as a halfback. He received a civil engineering degree in 1957. During the 1956 season, he played professional football in Canada as a member of the Montreal Alouettes. He entered the US Army and served two years as a lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers.

From 1958 to 1959, James worked as a heavy construction engineer with Burford-Toothaker Tractor Company in Montgomery, Alabama. He had married and started a family. In 1959, his second born, Gregory Fleming James, was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Needing more money to pay medical bills, James left Montgomery in 1960 to take a job as construction superintendent with Laidlaw Contracting Company, a road-paving company in Mobile.

In 1961, James decided that he could earn a living from the manufacture of plastic-coated barbells. In 1962, he founded Diversified Products Inc., a manufacturer of fitness equipment; it was known for the plastic-disc barbells filled with &quot;Orbatron,&quot; which DP patented. The company name was changed to &quot;Diversified Products Corporation&quot; after originally being called Health-Disc Inc. In addition to physical fitness equipment, the company manufactured ballasts and counterweights for farms, industry and trucking. James founded DP in his basement and, over the next 15 years, the company ultimately grew to employ 1,500 people with plants in Opelika, AL; Los Angeles, and Toronto, with sales of about $1 billion annually. James served as the CEO of DP until 1977, when it was bought by the Liggett Group.

James&#x27;s son Gregory died of cystic fibrosis at the age of eight. In 1981 James established the Gregory Fleming James Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, named in his honor. James played an integral role in the establishment of the center.

From 1972 to 1974, James served as president of the Alabama Citizens for Transportation, a statewide committee that developed a twenty-year highway program. This was subsequently adopted by the Alabama Legislature.

==Political career==

===First term===
During his 1978 campaign for governor, James campaigned as a &quot;born-again Democrat&quot;. James had left the Democratic Party in the early 1970s but returned to the party before the election. In the first primary, he defeated Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley, 296,196 votes to 210,089 votes. In the run-off, James easily outdistanced Baxley. In the November general election, he defeated the Republican candidate, Guy Hunt.

During James&#x27; first administration, the state faced considerable financial difficulties. James was reasonably successful in attaining his education reform package, improving the state&#x27;s mental health system, rectifying some prison overcrowding problems and fortifying the once financially strapped Medicaid system. James consolidated various state agencies to reduce state spending. Additionally, he implemented a ten percent State spending cut, instituted a hiring freeze, and laid off a considerable number of the state employee workforce. He also chose to emphasize funding for k-12 education, over that for Alabama&#x27;s colleges and universities, a highly contested action. He also worked to acquire stiffer penalties for convicted drug traffickers. He was instrumental in improving state highways as a result of earmarking a substantial amount of money for such improvements from the state&#x27;s oil windfall funds. James was unsuccessful in his attempts to: have a new state constitution drafted, levy a fuel tax, rectify the court-ordered desegregation of some of the state&#x27;s post-secondary institutions, and secure passage of his bill to eliminate income tax deductions for Social Security payments.

One of his greatest accomplishments was integrating Alabama government. During his inauguration, he &quot;claim(ed) for all Alabamians a New Beginning (his campaign theme) free from racism and discrimination.&quot; During his first term as governor, he nominated Oscar W. Adams Jr. to fill a vacancy on the Alabama Supreme Court, the first African American chosen for such a position. In addition, he appointed other blacks to cabinet positions, including Gary Cooper as director of the Department of Pensions and Security, the first African American in a century to be appointed to lead a major state agency in Alabama.

During his first term, James drew opposition by signing into law a measure passed by the legislature that allowed teachers to lead willing students in prayer. The law was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1985.

===Between terms===
James&#x27;s decision not to run again for governor in 1982 eased the way for former governor George Wallace to return to office for a fourth and final term. Out of office, however, James began to yearn for a return to the governorship. He ran but was defeated in both the 1986 and 1990 Democratic primaries.

Living a semi-retired life while out of office, he partnered with his sons in several businesses. He managed and partly owned Orange Beach Marina, served as the CEO of Coastal Erosion Control, a company that worked to prevent coastal erosion; and worked as the CEO of Escambia County Environmental Corporation, which develops landfills and waste incinerators. In the spring of 1994, James&#x27;s desire to be governor again led him to switch parties again. He qualified at the last moment as a Republican candidate.

First he defeated in a primary and runoff election, Winton Blount, III, of Montgomery and State Senator Ann Bedsole, a moderate Republican from Mobile. Bedsole refused to endorse James in the general election, but he still defeated incumbent Democratic Governor Jim Folsom, Jr., by a narrow margin, and won his second term as governor, this time as a Republican.

===Second term===
James governed as a staunch conservative during his second term, reflecting individualistic, states&#x27; rights convictions. James &quot;seceded&quot; from the National Governors Association, and was the only state governor to refuse to attend the organization&#x27;s meetings. In 1981, he designed the Alabama Budget Isolation Process as a hopeful remedy to years of legislative standstills. It is still in effect in the Legislature today.

As governor, James appointed Aubrey Miller, an African American, to head the Alabama Tourism Department. He also appointed Beth Chapman to his cabinet; she was the first woman in Alabama&#x27;s history to serve as Appointments Secretary.

====Crime and justice====

James took a &quot;tough&quot; position on crime and criminals. He and his prison commissioner, Ronald Jones, reinstituted chain gangs, a form of forced labor for Alabama&#x27;s prison inmates. This practice affected the disproportionately large African-American inmate population in Alabama, in which a discriminatory criminal justice system played a part. Inmates were displayed while in chains for mostly white tourists to see. Alabama became the first state to bring back the practice symbolic of and prevalent in the Jim Crow era, the post-slavery period where racism against African Americans was codified into law. The practice continued even as an African American inmate was killed by an officer after a fight with another inmate ensued at a chain gang worksite.

The Governor approved other policies instituted by Jones, but he balked at the commissioner&#x27;s suggestion that chain gangs be extended to include female prisoners. James put an end to the chain gang in June 1996, because of a lawsuit brought by a coalition of community human rights groups. Regarding crime issues, James cited as one of his &quot;major accomplishments&quot; the revision of the Alabama Criminal Code, which made it one of the toughest in the U.S.

During his second term James, who firmly supported the death penalty, presided over seven executions by electric chair (Alabama resumed executions in 1983). However, in one of his last official acts as governor, James commuted the death sentence of Judith Ann Neelley to life in prison. This remains, , the only post-Furman commutation of a death sentence by a governor in Alabama. James explained that, in his view, executing Neelley would not have been just. His reason was that the Neeley case was the only time he had seen a judge overrule the jury&#x27;s unanimous decision to impose life imprisonment by issuing a death penalty. But Alabama has more than one judge who has made his reputation on imposing the death penalty against jury votes.

James helped arrange a State of Alabama-paid voluntary return to the US of Lester Coleman, a former journalist accused by the federal government of committing perjury, who had been residing in Europe. According to Redding Pitt, a federal government attorney from Montgomery, Alabama, Coleman called James, an acquaintance from the 1970s, for help in his case. Coleman promoted alternative theories regarding the Lockerbie bombing. His perjury charges stemmed from his statements about that incident. Joe Boohaker, Coleman&#x27;s attorney, said that James apparently knew Coleman from when the latter man had worked at a Birmingham, Alabama radio station.

James defended embattled judge Roy Moore when Moore was ordered by a Montgomery circuit judge to remove his wooden representation of the Ten Commandments from his courtroom. James threatened to send in the National Guard to prevent the removal of the plaque with this display. In an interview, Fob also said of the removal of the confederate flag from state offices:

&quot;I think it&#x27;s a sick form of political correctness for everybody to act like they&#x27;re offended because history is portrayed like history was.&quot;

====Education====
The Alabama legislature joined James in passing an educational reform package known as the James Educational Foundation Act. This legislation required local school systems that were not already at a minimum level of support to raise local property taxes to 10 mills. It also increased the number of credit hours in academic subjects that students were required to have in order to graduate. This legislation empowered the state superintendent of education to take control of schools that scored poorly on national achievement tests. Prioritizing K-12 education, James shifted funding from the state&#x27;s colleges and universities; such action strained relations between higher education and the governor&#x27;s office.

James refused to accept federal monies from the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Goals 2000 program because he believed that it would lead to increased federal involvement and control over the state&#x27;s schools. When Secretary of Education Richard Riley promised that the Department of Education would not interfere in the use of the funds, Alabama&#x27;s state board of education ignored the governor&#x27;s protests and voted to accept the funding. They used it to purchase computers for K–12 classrooms.

====Religion controversies====
James was frequently criticized for expressing too much of his religious beliefs in his governing. At a 1995 Alabama State Board of Education meeting, James criticized the teaching of evolution in textbooks by imitating a &quot;slump-shouldered ape turning into an upright human&quot;. He supported the adoption of a textbook warning sticker that said, among other things, that &quot;No one was present when life first appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement about life&#x27;s origins should be considered as theory, not fact.&quot;

James&#x27;s most publicized religious battle was the lengthy controversy surrounding Etowah County Judge Roy S. Moore&#x27;s posting of the Ten Commandments in his courtroom and the offering of a daily Christian prayer before proceedings. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to have the practice stopped as unconstitutional. U.S. District Court Judge Ira DeMent, an appointee of President George H. W. Bush, ruled in its favor, ordering the removal of the commandment plaque and cessation of the prayers because they violated the First Amendment guarantee of separation of church and state. Judge Moore appealed the decision, and James supported his position. For a brief period he threatened to mobilize the Alabama National Guard and use force if necessary to prevent the removal of the Ten Commandments plaque from Moore&#x27;s courtroom.

In October 1997, Judge DeMent issued another sweeping order forbidding certain religious practices in DeKalb County&#x27;s public schools, which also aroused controversy. James verbally attacked DeMent&#x27;s order as yet another illegitimate intrusion by federal courts into local affairs. The judge&#x27;s order was, in part, reversed shortly after James left office, allowing students at their own choice to hold religious meetings on school grounds.

====Campaign for a third term====
In his campaign for re-election to a third term, James faced strong opposition in the Republican party primary from Winton Blount III, a fellow conservative and a millionaire businessman whom James was documented referring to as a &quot;fat monkey.&quot; He sharply criticized James&#x27;s close ties to the Christian right. James struggled through the bitter Republican primary runoff and defeated Blount, but had little money left to finance the general election campaign. Incumbent Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman easily won the Democratic primary on the sole issue of establishing a state lottery to provide for college scholarships. James opposed the lottery and was soundly defeated by Siegelman in the 1998 general election. He returned to semi-retirement, saying he wanted to spend more time with his children and grandchildren.

==Personal life and family==
James and his wife, Bobbie, live in Miami, Florida. As of 2021, Fob James resides in an independent-living apartment in close proximity to the nursing facility where Bobbie James lives. The couple had four children: Greg, who died in the 1960s of cystic fibrosis; Tim, a businessman and three-time candidate for governor of Alabama; Fob III, a trial lawyer; and Patrick, whom Fob and Bobbie James sued in 2015 over allegations of fraud.

<doc id="814242" wikidata="Q3656849" url="?curid=814242" title="Capital flight">
<text>Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence or as the result of a political event such as regime change or economic globalization. Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength.

This leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country—depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime. This fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency but their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country&#x27;s assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire any form of foreign facilities, e.g. medical facilities. 

== Discussion ==
Countries with resource-based economies experience the largest capital flight. A classical view on capital flight is that it is currency speculation that drives significant cross-border movements of private funds, enough to affect financial markets. The presence of capital flight indicates the need for policy reform.

In the book (Africa&#x27;s Odious Debts), Léonce Ndikumana and James K. Boyce argue that more than 65% of Africa&#x27;s borrowed debts do not even get into countries in Africa, but remain in private bank accounts in tax havens all over the world. Ndikumana and Boyce estimate that from 1970 to 2008, capital flight from 33 sub-Saharan countries totalled $700 billion. A 2008 paper published by Global Financial Integrity estimated capital flight, also called illicit financial flows to be &quot;out of developing countries are some $850 billion to $1 trillion a year.&quot;

Capital flight also takes place in order to evade taxes. In such cases, the flow tends to go in the direction of tax havens.

=== Legality ===

Capital flight may be legal or illegal under domestic law. Legal capital flight is recorded on the books of the entity or individual making the transfer, and earnings from interest, dividends, and realized capital gains normally return to the country of origin. Illegal capital flight, also known as illicit financial flows, is intended to disappear from any record in the country of origin and earnings on the stock of illegal capital flight outside of a country generally do not return to the country of origin. It is indicated as missing money from a nation&#x27;s balance of payments.

== Confirmed examples ==
In 1995, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that capital flight amounted to roughly half of the outstanding foreign debt of the most heavily indebted countries of the world.

Capital flight was seen in some Asian and Latin American markets in the 1990s. Perhaps the most consequential of these was the 1997 Asian financial crisis that started in Thailand and spread through much of East Asia beginning in July 1997, raising fears of a worldwide economic meltdown due to financial contagion.

The 1998–2002 Argentine great depression of 2001 was in part the result of massive capital flight, induced by fears that Argentina would default on its external debt (the situation was made worse by the fact that Argentina had an artificially low fixed exchange rate and was dependent on large levels of reserve currency). This was also seen in Venezuela in the early 1980s with one year&#x27;s total export income leaving through illegal capital flight.

In the last quarter of the 20th century, capital flight was observed from countries that offer low or negative real interest rate (like Russia and Argentina) to countries that offer higher real interest rate (like the People&#x27;s Republic of China).

A 2006 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave several examples of private capital leaving France in response to the country&#x27;s wealth tax. The article also stated, &quot;Eric Pinchet, author of a French tax guide, estimates the wealth tax earns the government about $2.6 billion a year but has cost the country more than $125 billion in capital flight since 1998.&quot;

A 2009 article in &quot;The Times&quot; reported that hundreds of wealthy financiers and entrepreneurs had recently fled England, Wales and Scotland in response to recent tax increases, and had relocated in low tax destinations such as Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, and the British Virgin Islands.

In May 2012 the scale of Greek capital flight in the wake of the first &quot;undecided&quot; legislative election was estimated at €4 billion a week and later that month the Spanish Central Bank revealed €97 billion in capital flight from the Spanish economy for the first quarter of 2012.

In the run up to the British referendum on leaving the EU (Brexit) there was a net capital outflow of £77 billion in the preceding two quarters, £65 billion in the quarter immediately before the referendum and £59 billion in March when the referendum campaign started. This corresponds to a figure of £2 billion in the equivalent six months in the preceding year.

<text>Ralph Ashley Horr (August 12, 1884 – January 26, 1960) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1931 to 1933. He represented the first congressional district of Washington as a Republican.

A graduate of the University of Illinois and of University of Washington School of Law, Horr ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Seattle, Washington in 1918 as a member of the Republican Party.

Horr won the Republican party&#x27;s nomination for the congressional seat then held by long-serving Republican John Franklin Miller in 1930. He was defeated two years later for renomination by Miller, who went on to lose the general election to Democrat Marion Zioncheck. Horr later lost races for United States Senate in 1934, for governor of Washington in 1936, and for mayor of Seattle in 1948.

<text>James Elisha &#x27;Jim&#x27; Folsom Jr. (born May 14, 1949) is an American politician who was the 50th governor of Alabama from April 22, 1993, to January 16, 1995. He has also served as the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama on two occasions. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

As of 2025 he is the most recent Democrat to have served as Alabama&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor.

==Early life and education==

Born in Montgomery, Alabama, he is the son of former First Lady of Alabama Jamelle Folsom and legendary two-term Alabama Governor James E. &quot;Big Jim&quot; Folsom Sr. Jim Folsom Jr. is therefore known as &quot;Little Jim&quot; even though he is well over six feet tall. In 1974, he graduated from Jacksonville State University, where he presently serves as a trustee.

==Early career==

During his first run for a political office, he lost the primary to incumbent Democratic Congressman Tom Bevill by an overwhelming margin. However he was elected to the Alabama Public Service Commission in 1978.

Folsom unlike his father was a moderate-to-conservative Democrat. He won support from groups his father had long opposed, especially a group of conservative business people known as the Big Mules. In 1980, Folsom ran for the U.S. Senate and attacked the incumbent, Donald W. Stewart, as being too liberal for Alabama and called him a &quot;puppet of the great Washington power structure.&quot; Although Stewart outspent Folsom $500,000 to $75,000, he very narrowly missed winning a majority in the primary and Folsom won the runoff. In the general election, Folsom lost by a narrow margin to Republican Jeremiah Denton, who was aided by the Ronald Reagan landslide, which helped Republican candidates across the country.

Folsom was re-elected to the Alabama Public Service Commission in 1982.

James Folsom was elected Alabama Lieutenant Governor and served from January 19, 1987, to April 22, 1993 (being re-elected in 1990). During both terms, as a matter of law, Folsom was also President and Presiding Officer of the Alabama State Senate. He served under Governor H. Guy Hunt, the first Republican Alabama Governor since Reconstruction. Hunt and Folsom also happen to be from the same (Cullman) county. Folsom also was a member of the National Association of Lieutenant Governors.

==Governorship==
In 1993, Hunt was convicted of state ethics law violations regarding the funding of Hunt&#x27;s second inaugural ceremonies. Like most states, Alabama&#x27;s constitution prohibits convicted felons from serving in office. As a result, Hunt was forced to resign on April 22, 1993, and Folsom automatically became governor.

Only weeks after Folsom assumed the office, state officials were approached by Mercedes-Benz about the possibility of locating its first manufacturing plant outside its native Germany in Alabama. Over the following months, Folsom led Alabama&#x27;s efforts to recruit the facility, culminating in an October 1993 announcement that Alabama had beaten 30 other states for the coveted facility. The prestige of the Mercedes plant opened the door for future automotive plants to locate in the state.

Within six days after taking office Governor Folsom ordered the removal of the Confederate flag from the state capitol to a memorial. His &quot;de facto&quot; Chief of Staff was his longtime friend and confidant, Charlie Waldrep, an attorney at Waldrep, Stewart &amp; Kendrick, LLC. Governor Folsom also appointed a number of African Americans and women to his staff.

In 1994, he ran for a full four-year term in his own right. Although some regarded Folsom as a popular governor, three candidates challenged him in the Democratic primary, the most serious being Paul Hubbert, the executive secretary of the Alabama Education Association and nominee for governor in 1990. Folsom after a fierce and sometimes nasty primary, fended off Hubbert&#x27;s challenge with 54% of the vote. But Hubbert&#x27;s primary challenge damaged Folsom, who in the General Election, was narrowly defeated by former Democratic Governor Fob James, who was running as a Republican. Even though 1994 was a tough year for Democrats and that Folsom was facing a popular former governor in James and had spent a lot of money to win his primary against Hubbert, the result was narrow. In fact, Folsom lost by less than 10,000 votes or 49.7%-50.3% to James.

Compared to other prominent Democratic incumbent Governors who lost that year such as Ann Richards in Texas, Bruce King in New Mexico, and Mario Cuomo in New York, Folsom ran much more strongly than they did. He also ran stronger than Democratic nominees in other Southern states with governor&#x27;s races, such as Phil Bredesen in Tennessee (who eventually was elected there in 2002), Jack Mildren in Oklahoma, and Nick Theodore in South Carolina.

==Post-governorship and return to politics==

In 2006, Folsom reentered state politics, running again as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. He won the Democratic nomination unopposed, and in the general election, he narrowly defeated Republican lawyer Luther Strange for a third, nonconsecutive four-year term. Folsom is the longest-serving lieutenant governor in Alabama history with 10 years of service; his third term ended on January 17, 2011.

Folsom endorsed former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the 2000 Democratic presidential primaries, Governor of Vermont Howard Dean in 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, and U.S. Senator and future President Barack Obama of Illinois in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. In 2016, he was a strong supporter of former Governor of Maryland Martin O&#x27;Malley for president.

He announced on April 1, 2009, that he would seek re-election as Lieutenant Governor in 2010 rather than run for the Democratic nomination for governor. On November 2, 2010, Folsom was defeated by three percentage points in his re-election bid for a fourth term by the Republican nominee, Kay Ivey. Folsom explored a potential 2018 bid for governor.

Folsom is married to the former Marsha Guthrie. They have two children. He is an Episcopalian.

<doc id="814304" wikidata="Q742978" url="?curid=814304" title="H. Guy Hunt">
<text>Harold Guy Hunt (June 17, 1933 – January 30, 2009) was an American politician who served as the 49th governor of Alabama from 1987 to 1993. He was the first Republican to serve as governor of the state since Reconstruction.

==Early life==
Hunt was born on June 17, 1933, in Holly Pond, Alabama to William Otto and Frances Holcombe Hunt. At an early age, Hunt joined the Mt. Vernon Primitive Baptist Church, which became a critical influence for the future governor. Less than a year out of high school at only 17 years of age, Hunt married Helen Chambers on February 25, 1951, and the couple had four children who continued his family&#x27;s farming tradition.

During the Korean War, Hunt served in two divisions of the U.S. Army, earning the certificate of achievement for outstanding performance of military duty and the distinguished service medal. After his military service, Hunt returned to his family farm at Holly Pond and eventually was formally ordained as a minister in the Primitive Baptist Church.

==Political career==
Hunt was active in the Republican Party from the days when the Democrats held near-total control of the state. He first ran for office in 1962, an unsuccessful run for the Alabama Senate.

In 1964, he was elected probate judge of Cullman County. Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s signing of the Civil Rights Act caused many Democrats to split the ticket and vote for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater that year, and Hunt was one of several Republicans swept into office on Goldwater&#x27;s coattails making him the youngest probate judge in Alabama. He was reelected in 1970, stepping down in 1976 to honor a promise to serve only two terms.
He was State Chairman of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaigns in 1976 and 1980 and chaired the state&#x27;s Republican delegation at the 1976 and 1980 Republican National Conventions. 
In the 1978 Alabama gubernatorial election, Hunt was the Republican nominee for governor, but he lost in a massive landslide to then-Democrat Fob James.

==Election as governor==

After Reagan won the US election in 1980, he appointed Hunt as the Alabama State Director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee. He resigned in 1985 to run for governor. His campaign was not taken seriously at first even among Republicans, who were more concerned about helping Senator Jeremiah Denton win reelection. The press paid little attention to the Republican gubernatorial primary, fully expecting that the winner of the Democratic primary would be the next governor.

Concurrently, the Democratic primary saw then Alabama Attorney General Charles Graddick in a runoff with Lieutenant Governor Bill Baxley. Graddick, the more conservative candidate, won by a few thousand votes. However, Baxley sued, claiming that Graddick violated primary regulations by encouraging Republicans to &quot;cross over&quot; and vote as Democrats. Graddick, for his part, maintained that this was legal because Alabama was an open primary state. The state Supreme Court told the Democrats to either declare Baxley the winner by default or hold another primary. The party picked Baxley.

Alabamians, accustomed to a system where anybody and everybody could vote in a primary, were outraged and took out their frustrations by voting for Hunt. In November, Hunt won the election by 13 points and 56 percent of the vote, receiving the most votes ever for a gubernatorial candidate at that time. Hunt&#x27;s election surprised many Alabamians since the last Republican governor had left office 113 years earlier, at the end of Reconstruction.

He narrowly won reelection in 1990 after trailing most of the way. Hunt&#x27;s election is widely credited for beginning the rise of the state Republican Party; only two Democrats have held the office since his tenure, and only one of them by election.

Hunt pushed through major tort reform and tried to bring more industry and tourism to the state, but had to wrangle through massive opposition in the state legislature.

As Governor, Hunt presided over eight executions in Alabama, all by electric chair.

== Criminal charges, 1992 ==
In 1992, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that taxpayers could sue Hunt for flying on state-owned aircraft to preaching engagements, where Hunt received monetary &#x27;love offerings.&#x27; The charges were eventually dropped.

== Criminal charges and conviction ==
A grand jury indicted Hunt for theft, conspiracy, and ethics violations. Prosecutors said that he took over $200,000 from a 1987 inaugural account and used it to for personal use such as marble showers and new lawnmowers. Hunt was found guilty. As the state constitution does not allow convicted felons to hold office, Hunt was forced to resign on April 22, 1993.

Hunt was also ordered to pay $212,000, given five years&#x27; probation, and serve 1,000 hours of community service. In February 1998 he asked the state parole board to reduce his probation by four months; the judge instead increased the probation by five years, since he had only paid $4,000 of his $212,000 fine. In April 1998, having served his full sentence and paid his fine, the parole board granted Hunt a pardon.

== 2002 State Senate run ==
Hunt was the Republican nominee in the 2002 Alabama Senate election for the 4th Senate district. He lost to incumbent Democratic Senator Zeb Little, receiving 36.1% of the vote to Little&#x27;s 61.7%.

==Death==
Hunt died on January 30, 2009, at the age of 75, after a long battle with lung cancer.

<text>John Franklin Miller (June 9, 1862 – May 28, 1936), an American politician, served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1917 to 1931. He represented the First Congressional District of Washington as a Republican. He also served as the Mayor of Seattle from 1908 through 1910.

Miller ran for election to the seat being vacated by fellow Republican William Humphrey (who was running for United States Senate) in 1916, winning that election and the elections of 1918, 1920, 1922, 1924, 1926, and 1928. He was defeated for the Republican nomination in 1930 by Ralph Horr, who then won the general election. John Franklin Miller was named after his uncle, also John Franklin Miller, a senator from California. Both sometimes went by John F. Miller.

Miller supported racist policies in Congress, claiming to his fellow House members that &quot;No greater tragedy can befall an American girl than to become the wife of a Japanese,&quot; and &quot;There is not a scientist, an alienist, a scholar of the world who does not believe in the preservation of racial purity.&quot;

<text>West Roxbury is a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, bordered by Roslindale and Jamaica Plain to the northeast, the village of Chestnut Hill and the town of Brookline to the north, the city of Newton to the northwest, the towns of Dedham and Needham to the southwest, and Hyde Park to the southeast. West Roxbury is often mistakenly confused with Roxbury, but the two are separated from each other by Roslindale and Jamaica Plain.

== History ==
Before 1630, the area was inhabited by the Wampanoag Indian Tribe.

Founded in 1630 (contemporaneously with Boston), West Roxbury was originally part of the town of Roxbury and was mainly used as farmland. West Roxbury seceded from Roxbury in 1851, and was annexed by Boston in 1874. The town included the neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain and Roslindale.

West Roxbury&#x27;s main commercial thoroughfare is Centre Street. West Roxbury Main Streets is a local non-profit that works to enhance and promote the business district. The neighborhood has some two-family houses but mostly single family homes; many of Boston&#x27;s civil servants live there.

West Roxbury is home to District E-5 of the Boston Police Department. Boston Emergency Medical Services Ambulance 5, which posts at the intersection of West Roxbury Parkway at Centre St, and Paramedic 5, stationed at the Faulkner Hospital, provide EMS service. There are two Boston fire stations: Ladder 25 and Engine 30 on Centre Street, and Engine 55 on Washington Street. A large Veterans Affairs hospital is located opposite the Charles River on the VFW Parkway near the Dedham line.

The Needham Branch of the MBTA Commuter Rail network has three stations in West Roxbury (Bellevue, Highland and West Roxbury). Several MBTA bus lines run through and/or terminate in West Roxbury. 

West Roxbury is home to several places of worship, including three Catholic parishes, churches of various Protestant denominations, and a Jewish synagogue.

The neighborhood was home to an experimental transcendentalist Utopian community called Brook Farm, which attracted notable figures including Margaret Fuller and Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose 1852 novel &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; is based on his stay there.

Like that of its neighboring communities, West Roxbury&#x27;s residential development coincided with the construction of the West Roxbury branch of the Boston and Providence Railroad, and the area grew further with the development of electric streetcars.

==Demographics==
Until the 2000 census West Roxbury&#x27;s population had been recorded as declining slightly, but it increased at the 2010 census. This could be due to more rigorous counting procedures instituted by the City of Boston and Massachusetts in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid losing the state&#x27;s tenth congressional seat.
:2010 Census 30,446 (4.9% of 617,594 citywide)
:2000 Census 28,663 (4.9% of 589,141 citywide)
:1990 Census 29,706 (5.2% of 574,383 citywide)
:1980 Census 31,333
:Population growth/decline, 2000–2010: +6.2%
:Population growth/decline, 1990–2000: -3.51%
:Population growth/decline, 1980–1990: -5.19%

West Roxbury has historically been a heavily Irish Catholic neighborhood. In the twentieth century, upwardly mobile Irish Americans moved to the neighborhood from elsewhere in Boston. By the first decade of the 21st century, an influx of new residents contributed to increased ethnic diversity in the neighborhood.

The Irish Social Club of Boston, founded in Dorchester in 1945, moved its headquarters to West Roxbury in 1978, and had a membership of 15,000 in the mid-1970s. The club closed in 2011 due to financial troubles and declining membership (the club had around 300 members at the time, mostly seniors). Support from the State Representative Ed Coppinger, Boston City Councilor Matt O’Malley, and State Senator Mike Rush allowed the club to obtain a liquor license and reopen, and by 2013 the group had about 800 members.

In March 1965, an investigative study of property tax assessment practices published by the National Tax Association of 13,769 properties sold within the City of Boston under Mayor John F. Collins from January 1, 1960 to March 31, 1964, found that the assessed values in Roxbury in 1962 were at 68 percent of market values while the assessed values in West Roxbury were at 41 percent of market values, and the researchers could not find a nonracial explanation for the difference.

==Theodore Parker Church==
At Centre and Corey Streets, the Theodore Parker Church features seven stained glass windows made by the Tiffany Studios between 1894 and 1927. The original church, designed in 1890 by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow Jr., is now a parish hall. Henry Seaver designed the current church in 1900. Theodore Parker (1810–1860), an advocate of progressive religious ideas, abolitionism and women&#x27;s suffrage, was minister of this Unitarian congregation from 1837 to 1846.

==Westerly Burying Ground conflict and secession==
Westerly Burying Ground, also known as Westerly Burial Ground, (currently at Centre and LaGrange Streets) was established in 1683 to permit local burial of residents of Jamaica Plain and the western end of Roxbury. When West Roxbury was still part of Roxbury, the town&#x27;s first burial place was what is today Eliot Burying Ground, near Dudley Square. This was a long distance to travel for the inhabitants of West Roxbury, and in 1683 the town selectmen voted to establish a local burying place, now known as Westerly Burying Ground. A conflict between the rural and more urbanised parts of the town led to the split of West Roxbury from Roxbury proper in 1851. West Roxbury became part of the City of Boston on 5 January 1874. Westerly Burying Ground served as this community&#x27;s burial place well into the 19th century. The oldest graves contain many of the town&#x27;s earliest and most prominent families. Eight veterans of the American Revolution and fifteen veterans of the American Civil War are also buried here.
War veterans interred are detailed in the article &quot;“Westerly&quot; and the Civil War&quot;.
The site has a large collection of three centuries of funerary art. One-third of its extant gravestones date from the 18th century; almost half date from the 19th century, and about twenty from the 20th-century. Westerly Burying Ground has many individual mound tombs; mound tombs at other burying grounds are typically larger, built to contain a number of bodies. The oldest gravestone, from 1691, commemorates James and Merriam Draper, members of a prominent West Roxbury family. Headstones, skilfully carved locally, provide an historic record of three centuries of West Roxbury residents.

==Boston United Hand in Hand Cemetery==

Boston United Hand in Hand Cemetery is located on Centre Street straddling the Dedham line. Dating back to 1875, the original plot was full by 1896 but subsequently expanded multiple times. There are graves as recent as 1980 in the West Roxbury portion; the Dedham portion is still active. Chestnut Hill&#x27;s Congregation Mishka Tefila currently owns the cemetery.

==Government and infrastructure==
The United States Postal Service operates the West Roxbury Post Office in West Roxbury.
West Roxbury is represented by a city councilor, Ben Weber.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===
Boston Public Schools operates public schools. Ludwig van Beethoven Elementary School, William Ohrenberger School, Joyce Kilmer K-8 School, and Patrick Lyndon K-8 School are in West Roxbury. The three schools in the West Roxbury Education Complex, Media Communications Technology High School, Parkway Academy of Technology and Health, and the Urban Science Academy were located in West Roxbury, but closed in 2019 due to structural issues in the building.

The Roxbury Latin School, a private school for boys, is located in West Roxbury. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston operates the Holy Name Parish School as well as the St. Theresa of Avila School in West Roxbury.

Catholic Memorial School, which is an all boys private middle and high school, is located on Baker Street.

===Public libraries===

Boston Public Library operates the West Roxbury Branch Library. In 1876 the city library took over the West Roxbury Free Library, establishing a delivery station in West Roxbury. The West Roxbury facility was upgraded to a library branch in 1896. In the years of 1921 and 1922 a library building was constructed on the West Roxbury Branch Library current site. In 1973, a fire destroyed the adjacent West Roxbury Congregational Church. The land formerly occupied by the church was donated to the trustees of the library system so an addition could be built. The addition opened to the public on 24 September 1989.

==Events==

The Corrib Classic 5K Road Race is held annually at Billings Field, LaGrange Street, the first Sunday in June. Since starting in 1994 with 250 runners the event has grown into the largest community event, attracting about 2000 runners, plus event volunteers, families and friends. Centre and Lagrange Streets are briefly closed during the race. It is a benefit event hosted by the Bligh family of the adjacent Corrib Pub and Restaurant that has raised over half a million dollars over the years for a variety of local causes.
The Parkway Little League Parade, is a small event to start little league baseball and softball for the areas of West Roxbury and Roslindale. Young baseball and softball players dress up in their team uniforms and march from Fallon field in Roslindale to the Guy Cammarata Complex in West Roxbury. The Shamrock Shootout is an annual street hockey tournament that takes place in West Roxbury. The event was started in 2008 for neighborhood kids who had school off for Evacuation Day. The tournament is free with registration.

<text>The Marine Building is a skyscraper located at 355 Burrard Street in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada near the Financial District. Completed in 1930, at the time of its opening it was the city&#x27;s tallest skyscraper and it is listed among the best Art Deco buildings in the world. It owes its name to the plethora of fine marine-themed ornaments that decorate it. Because of its architecture and interior decorations, the building has been chosen as the setting of a number of film and television productions.
==History==
The building was conceived by Lt. Commander J.W. Hobbs, an entrepreneur from Toronto. Hobbs recognized that the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 would greatly increase Vancouver&#x27;s importance as a commercial port, and decided that the city needed a grand building, in the vein of the newly constructed Chrysler Building in New York. The design was assigned to McCarter Nairne and Partners, who had never worked on the design of a skyscraper before. Construction started on March 13, 1929 as reported by a local newspaper:

The building was completed on 7 October 1930. At (22 floors) it was the tallest skyscraper in the city until 1939. According to the architects, McCarter &amp; Nairne, the building was intended to evoke &quot;some great crag rising from the sea, clinging with sea flora and fauna, tinted in sea-green, touched with gold.&quot; The building cost $2.3 million to build – $1.1 million over budget—but due to the Great Depression it was sold to the Guinness family of Ireland for only $900,000. The 2023 property assessment is $153 million.

There was an observation deck, but during the depression in the 1930s the 25-cent admission price proved unaffordable for most. Currently, there are no public galleries in the building.

Inside the massive brass-doored elevators the walls are inlaid with 12 varieties of local hardwoods. All over the walls and polished brass doors are depictions of sea snails, skate, crabs, turtles, carp, scallops, seaweed and sea horses, as well as the transportation means of the era. The floor presents the zodiac signs. The exterior is studded with flora and fauna, tinted in sea-green and touched with gold.

During a renovation from 1982-1989 to update the electrical, mechanical and air-conditioning systems, the &quot;battleship linoleum&quot; (imported from Scotland) in the lobby was replaced with marble. The former Merchant Exchange was also gutted, and is now a restaurant called Tractor Foods. This building was also the management centre for Oneworld, of one of the three largest airline alliances in the world, from its founding in May 2000 until it was relocated to New York City in June 2011.

==In popular culture==
The building has often been used in filmmaking and television production. It was the setting for the final scene in the movie, &quot;Timecop &quot;and it was used as the headquarters of the Daily Planet in the popular television show &quot;Smallville&quot; and as the Freelancers headquarter in the TV show &quot;Continuum&quot;. The building was used in the movie &quot;&quot;. It stood in for the Baxter Building in New York City in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;.

<doc id="814364" wikidata="Q7730952" url="?curid=814364" title="The Dream with Roy and HG">
<text>The Dream with Roy and HG was a sports/comedy talk show, broadcast every night during the Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004 Olympics, presented by Australian comedy duo Roy and HG.

Their telecasts became one of the most popular events of the Games, with Olympians from all nations queueing up to appear. The gifts given to interviewees became some of the most valuable collectors&#x27; items of the Games.

Due to the attention on Australia as the host nation, the 2000 season took the form of a two-hour show and was made available to Olympic broadcasters internationally; the 2004 season was a one-hour show broadcast in Australia only.

The pair became well known for their commentary of certain events, particularly the men&#x27;s gymnastics. Speaking with mock-seriousness, Roy and H.G. used fictitious terminology to describe various manoeuvres. Such coined terms included adapted vernacular such as &quot;battered sav&quot; and &quot;Chiko Roll&quot;, and other inventions like &quot;flat bag&quot;, &quot;Dutch wink&quot;, &quot;crazy date&quot; and &quot;hello boys&quot; that became familiar to viewers worldwide. Roy and H.G. also interspersed their commentary with made-up &quot;facts&quot; about the competitors, such as their occupation and pre-match preparation routines. Other running jokes included showing slow-motion clips of Greco-Roman wrestling accompanied by raunchy Barry White music and the very snugly fitting outfits worn by the male Rowing teams.

They also popularised Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat as their mascot, dismissing the official mascots as &quot;Olly, Millie, and Dickhead&quot;. This was emphasised in a satirical diving contest between Fatso, the three official mascots, and the Boxing Kangaroo later in the Games. Fatso&#x27;s huge popularity during the series caused consternation with the Australian Olympic Committee, who at first tried to ban the character from Olympic events after Australian athletes appeared carrying Fatso dolls at medal ceremonies. When auctioned for charity at the end of the series, Fatso was purchased by Seven Network CEO Kerry Stokes for A$80,450. A statue of Fatso was later erected at the Olympic Park site.

Insulting New Zealanders, particularly by way of the medal tally, was also a favourite pastime of Roy. When New Zealand won their first gold of the Games in the rowing, he remarked: &quot;And New Zealanders perform at their best when they&#x27;re sitting down going backwards.&quot; During the 2004 season, Norway was insulted frequently, along with New Zealanders, as was former Olympic host city Atlanta, which Roy regularly denounced as &quot;the toilet&quot;.

==Spin-off shows==

The show&#x27;s popularity during the 2000 season prompted the creation of two spin-off shows, broadcast in Australia only—&quot;The Ice Dream&quot; during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and &quot;The Cream&quot;, during the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The show&#x27;s success also spawned &quot;The Monday Dump&quot;, a weekly sports/talk show with a similar format but lacking the central focus of a single sporting event.

==Awards==
In 2001, the show won Most Popular Sports Program at the Logies. In 2005, the show was nominated for the same category.

<doc id="814375" wikidata="Q2140315" url="?curid=814375" title="Textron">
<text>Textron Inc. is an American industrial conglomerate based in Providence, Rhode Island. Textron&#x27;s subsidiaries include Arctic Cat, Bell Textron, Textron Aviation (which itself includes the Beechcraft and Cessna brands), and Lycoming Engines. It was founded by Royal Little in 1923 as the Special Yarns Company. In 2020, Textron employed over 33,000 people in 25 countries.
The company ranked 265th on the 2021 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.

==History==
===Early history===

Textron started as a textile company in 1923, when 27-year-old Royal Little founded the Special Yarns Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts. The company manufactured synthetic yarns, a niche product at the time. By the start of World War II, the company was known as Atlantic Rayon Corporation and manufactured parachutes. As war production wound down, the company started making civilian products as well and was renamed Textron: &quot;Tex&quot; for &quot;textiles&quot; and &quot;tron&quot; from synthetics such as &quot;Lustron&quot;. The company was listed on the NYSE in 1947.

Royal Little began the process of turning Textron into a conglomerate in 1953, with the purchase of Burkart Manufacturing Company (upholstery filling for the automotive industry) in September 1953, followed by the purchase of Dalmo-Victor (airborne Radar Antennae) and MB Manufacturing Company in early 1954. The push for diversification would see Textron purchase various other manufacturing companies. In 1960, the company also bought Bell Aerospace and E-Z-Go. The textile division was sold to Deering Milliken in 1963.

Later CEOs included G. William Miller (1968–1977), Joseph Collinson (1977–1979) and Robert P. Straetz (1979–1986). In 1984, Textron took on more debt and bought Avco, a conglomerate almost as big as itself. Later on, James Hardymon took over as CEO. This $1.4 billion acquisition included the parent of Paul Revere Insurance Company (through 1996, when they sold it).

===Campbell era===
James Hardymon brought in Lewis B. Campbell, who became CEO in 1998. Starting in 2000, Campbell led a company-wide restructuring program. The share price fell to as low as $13/share in March 2003 after the economic downturn following the collapse of Internet companies and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Diminished demand for helicopters and airplanes led to layoffs at Cessna and Bell Textron.

In 2007, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Campbell had received $494,700 in compensation in the form of his use of a corporate jet to travel between his home and office, which made him the most expensive CEO in the country in terms of use of jet travel. Some shareholders have questioned whether it is a good use of shareholder dollars to pay for the personal lifestyle choice of the CEO to live in one state and work in another. Shares in Textron plummeted to as low as $10.09 per share in the aftermath of the 2008 economic downturn, driving its market capitalization down to just $3.17 billion. While the company lost 75% of its value in the first ten years of Campbell&#x27;s leadership, he managed to take home over $120 million in compensation. His salary in 2008 was $25 million, making him the highest-paid executive of a conglomerate. Campbell managed to sell over $40 million in Textron stock in April and May 2008, at prices over $60 per share.

===After Campbell===
Scott C. Donnelly became CEO in December 2009. Textron acquired Mechtronix in Montreal, Quebec, and OPINICUS in Tampa, Florida, in 2013. Donnelly combined these flight simulation companies, along with Textron&#x27;s AAI Logistics &amp; Technical Services, to form TRU Simulation &amp; Training in 2014.

On December 26, 2013, Textron agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale closed in March 2014. The company formed a new company called Textron Aviation to market the products of Beechcraft, Cessna and Hawker as individual brands.

From 2013 to 2016, R&amp;D investments were 4.3%, 4.0%, 4.6%, and 4.2% of its revenues ($13.78 billion in 2016) and totaled more than $2.2 billion as it developed seven aircraft: the Bell 525 Relentless, Bell V-280 Valor tiltrotor, Cessna Citation Longitude, Cessna Citation Hemisphere, Beechcraft Denali single-engine turboprop, the Cessna SkyCourier twin cargo hauler and the Textron Scorpion close support jet after the certification of the Bell 505 Jet Ranger X.

In March 2022, Textron agreed to acquire Pipistrel, an electrically powered aircraft manufacturer based in Italy and Slovenia.

On April 5, 2022, U.S. authorities announced criminal as well as civil charges in a Manhattan federal court against the former head of a now-defunct London-based company, Xcalibur Aerospace Ltd., for making a fraudulent bid to buy Textron for $13.8 billion. The Department of Justice and the SEC claimed that Xcalibur Aerospace was never in a position to complete a tender offer for Textron and lacked the finances to do so.

On May 28, 2024, Textron publicly announced the completion of the 400th Cessna Citation Latitude business jet at its manufacturing facility in Wichita, Kansas. Scheduled for delivery later this year, the significant achievement was marked by a celebratory event held by employees at the company&#x27;s Wichita headquarters.

<text>William Ewart Humphrey (March 31, 1862 – February 14, 1934) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1903 to 1917. He represented the state of Washington at large from 1903 to 1909 and the First Congressional District of Washington from 1909 to 1917. Humphrey also served as a member of the Federal Trade Commission from 1925 to 1933.

==Biography==
Humphrey was born near Alamo, Indiana, and attended local common schools. He graduated from Wabash College in 1887 and then went on to study law. Humphrey was admitted to the Indiana State Bar in 1887, and started a practice in Crawfordsville, Indiana. When the economic Panic of 1893 struck, he moved to Seattle, Washington, continuing to practice law.

Humphrey was elected as a Republican to fill Washington&#x27;s new third seat in the House of Representatives in 1902. He was re-elected in 1904 and 1906 to this position. The seat was elected by the state at large until the election of 1908, when the three seats were divided into congressional districts. Humphrey&#x27;s seat became the First Congressional District of Washington, with Humphrey winning the first election to the new District in 1908 and re-election in 1910, 1912, and 1914. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1916, which marked the end of his congressional career.

President Calvin Coolidge appointed Humphrey as a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1925, and he was reappointed for another six-year term in 1931. Because of policy disagreements, Humphrey was dismissed from the FTC by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. Humphrey, however, refused to recognize his dismissal, and brought a lawsuit in the United States Court of Claims to seek compensation for his continued employment, and legal questions from the lawsuit went (posthumously) before the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Humphrey&#x27;s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602&quot; (1935), in which the Court ruled that Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to terminate Humphrey violated an express limitation on presidential power set forth by Congress in the Federal Trade Commission Act.

Humphrey died from a hemorrhagic stroke in Washington, D.C., on February 14, 1934.

<text>Luka Bloom (born Kevin Barry Moore; 23 May 1955) is an Irish folk singer-songwriter. He is the younger brother of folk singer Christy Moore.

==Early life==
Kevin Barry Moore was born on 23 May 1955 in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland. His parents were Andy Moore and Nancy Power, who had already raised three daughters and two other sons. Moore attended a Patrician Brothers primary school and later studied at Newbridge College. In college he formed the group Aes Triplex with his brother Andy and a school friend. He later attended a college in Limerick, but he dropped out after a couple of years to pursue a music career.

==Early career as Barry Moore==
In 1969, 14 year old Barry Moore embarked on a tour supporting his eldest brother, Christy, at various English folk clubs. He subsequently spent all of his spare time practising and writing music. In 1976, Christy recorded one of his songs &quot;Wave up to the Shore&quot;. In 1977, Barry Moore toured Germany and England as part of the group Inchiquin.

In 1978, Moore released his debut album, &quot;Treaty Stone&quot;. In 1979, having normally played guitar using a finger-picking technique, he was afflicted with tendinitis—forcing him to learn to play with a plectrum, which altered his guitar style. That year, he moved to Groningen in the Netherlands. In 1980, he recorded and released his second album, &quot;In Groningen&quot;. In 1982, he released his third album, &quot;No Heroes&quot;, which contained songs all written by Moore himself. For three years, from 1983 to 1986, Moore was the front-man for the Dublin-based band Red Square. During this time, in 1984, his son Robbie was born.

==Musical career==
In 1987, Moore moved to the United States and began performing using the stage name of &quot;Luka Bloom&quot;. He chose the name &quot;Luka&quot; from the title of Suzanne Vega&#x27;s song about child abuse and &quot;Bloom&quot; from the main character in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Initially he lived and performed primarily in Washington D.C., but in winter 1987 he moved to New York City. The following year, he released his first album – later withdrawn – under the name Luka Bloom.

In 1990, Bloom released his album &quot;Riverside&quot;, which included the song &quot;The Man Is Alive&quot;. The album was recorded in New York, with its lyrics reflecting his experiences living and performing in that city. In 1991, Bloom returned to Dublin to record &quot;The Acoustic Motorbike&quot;, which included a cover version of LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;I Need Love&quot;. The cover song was reviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, noting that &quot;the prospect of a folksy Irish rocker covering a rap ballad may seem strange, but experimenting with different forms is precisely what keeps established traditions vital.&quot;

In 1993, Bloom again returned to Ireland to record the album &quot;Turf&quot;, this time with producer Brian Masterson and sound engineer Paul Ashe-Browne. The album attempted to capture the sound of a live performance, and was recorded in front of an audience that was asked to remain as quiet as possible. In 1998, Bloom released &quot;Salty Heaven&quot;, an album inspired by his return to Ireland.

Bloom&#x27;s early albums showcased his frenetic strumming style (once described as &quot;stadium rock for the bedroom&quot;), including &quot;Delirious&quot;, the debut track on Riverside, and his penchant for thoughtful cover songs, an affinity that he maintains even in more recent work. He had previously covered LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;I Need Love&quot; and Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; on the album &quot;The Acoustic Motorbike&quot;.

Released in 2000, &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot; was an album of cover versions featuring renditions of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Natural Mystic&quot;, and the Hunters and Collectors&#x27; &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot;, among others.

Bloom&#x27;s 2004 acoustic mini-album, &quot;Before Sleep Comes&quot;, was recorded while he was recovering from tendinitis. He stated that the purpose of the album was &quot;to help bring you closer to sleep, our sometimes elusive night-friend&quot;.

In 2005, Bloom released the album &quot;Innocence&quot;. Some of the songs feature a new-found interest in Eastern European Romany music and other world music. The album features Bloom playing classical guitar, and the resonant plucking associated with that style of instrument. In his previous work, Bloom relied almost exclusively on steel-stringed guitars that created his distinctive style.

In 2007, Bloom released the album &quot;Tribe&quot; —a collaboration with County Clare musician Simon O&#x27;Reilly. O&#x27;Reilly composed the music and sent the recordings to Bloom for him to complete with lyrics and singing.

In February 2008, Bloom released a DVD titled &quot;The Man is Alive&quot;, featuring footage filmed in Dublin and at his home in Kildare, a question and answer session with fans, the documentary &quot;My Name is Luka&quot;, and a CD of music taken from the two performances.

In September 2008, Bloom released the album &quot;Eleven Songs&quot;, which featured an expanded ensemble of instrumentation, giving the album a distinct sound within his catalogue.

<text>Amy (also &quot;Avnas&quot;, &quot;Auns&quot;, &quot;Hanar&quot;, &quot;Hanni&quot;) is a demon described in demonological grimoires such as &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (including Thomas Rudd&#x27;s version), the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, and in the &quot;Munich Manual of Demonic Magic&quot;; as well as Jacques Collin de Plancy &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;, 

Amy is described as a President, appearing initially as a flame before turning to a human form. He is claimed to teach astronomy and liberal arts, give familiars, incite positive reactions from rulers, and (according to all sources except the &quot;Munich Manual&quot;) reveal treasures. According to all sources, he rules over 36 legions of demons. According to Johann Weyer, he was of both the order of angels and &quot;potestates&quot; (powers), and holds the futile hope of returning to the seventh heaven after 12 centuries. According to Rudd, Amy is opposed by the &quot;Shem HaMephorash&quot; angel Ieialel.

== In popular culture ==
Amy (Kirio) is an antagonistic character from the anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun.

<doc id="814461" wikidata="Q4888678" url="?curid=814461" title="Benjamin Franklin White">
<text>Benjamin Franklin White (September 20, 1800 – December 5, 1879) was a shape note &quot;singing master&quot;, and compiler of the shape note tunebook known as &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;. He was born near Cross Keys in Union County, South Carolina, the twelfth child of Robert and Mildred White.

==Musical career==
White and Elisha J. King published &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; in 1844, using the four-shape shape note notation. King died in 1844. In 1845, White led in the establishment of the &quot;Southern Musical Convention&quot;. In 1850, he issued a second edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;, adding 97 songs and 103 pages. With the 1850 and future editions, White was assisted by a musical committee appointed by the Southern Musical Convention. In 1859, a third edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; was released, adding 74 more songs on 63 pages. A fourth edition came out in 1869. For the first time, in this revision White replaced old songs with new ones, rather than simply adding the new songs to the back of the book. A year later, he released a copyright of the same book signed only by himself and his son, D. P. White, perhaps clarifying ownership. In 1911, White&#x27;s youngest son, James Landrum White, reissued this fourth edition with a supplement of newer gospel songs. White also taught music; among his pupils was Sarah Lancaster.

White served as Clerk of the Inferior Court of Harris County, and mayor of Whitesville, Georgia.

==As journalist==
In 1852, B. F. White was named as Superintendent of the first newspaper published in Harris County, &quot;The Organ&quot;, which was &quot;published by authority of the Southern Musical Convention&quot;. This newspaper, published in Hamilton, Georgia, served a double purpose: it printed various local and national news stories, taken from major newspapers or off the telegraph, but was also meant as a musical publication. Among the musical materials it included were &quot;songs, minutes of singing conventions, musical debates, letters from singers, and advertisements for books.&quot; White participated with gusto in a number of debates about music in the pages of this paper.

A few songs appear in the W. M. Cooper edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; with the mysterious notation &quot;For the Organ&quot;. This notation, otherwise baffling in a tradition that is firmly a cappella, apparently indicates their original publication in the newspaper.

==Family life and descendants==

Benjamin F. White married Thurza Melvina Golightly on December 30, 1825 in Spartanburg District, SC. William Walker, publisher of the &quot;Southern Harmony&quot;, married Thurza&#x27;s sister, Amy. The Whites moved from Spartanburg District, SC to Harris County, Georgia in 1842.

To B. F. and Thurza were born nine children: William Decatur, David Patillo, Robert H., Mary Caroline, Nancy Ogburn, Thurza Melvina, Benjamin Franklin, Jr., James Landrum, and Martha America. Of these, David Patillo, James Landrum, and Benjamin Franklin, Jr. grew up to be prominent figures in Sacred Harp singing.

==Death and eulogy==
B. F. White died in 1879 and was buried in the Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia. The following year, members of the Chattahoochee Musical Convention eulogized him thus:
White is the namesake of the shape note tune &quot;White&quot; by Edmund Dumas.

<text>The Canopy Group is an American investment and property management firm founded by Ray Noorda in 1995 through the Noorda Family Trust. It is headquartered in Lindon, Utah. At various times it has consisted of, or been known as, Canopy Technologies, Canopy Properties, and Canopy Ventures.

The Canopy Group served as the parent company of various start-up technology companies. It was one of the first venture capital firms in the Utah area and, investing in over a hundred such companies, became a pioneer in the Utah high-technology space. One of the most well-known companies it invested in was The SCO Group. Canopy divested itself of SCO in 2005 with the settlement of the Yarro case. 

In 2011, Canopy&#x27;s technology venture arm was purchased by Signal Peak Ventures. Today, Canopy provides real estate and rental space to high-tech companies.

==History==
=== Background ===
As its chief executive during the 1980s and early 1990s, Ray Noorda had taken the software company Novell to a dominant position in the network operating system space and in so doing became a personal computer industry pioneer. As a result, Noorda had a reported worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 

The origins of the Canopy Group date to 1992, when Noorda created NFT Ventures as an arm of the Noorda Family Trust. NFT Ventures invested in a number of firms and helped to guide them. Through NFT Ventures and other means, Noorda had invested in several dozen start-up firms overall by 1995. In part, Noorda was interested in the venture capital business as a way to increase the funds that he could donate to Noorda Family Trust charities, but he was also interested in making his home state of Utah a place where entrepreneurs could thrive.

=== Early years ===
Noorda retired from Novell in 1994. In 1995, The Canopy Group was founded as a venture capital firm. (Some sources place the founding of the Canopy Group as having happened in 1992, but this may be a reference to the predecessor origins.) Venture capitalists were relatively uncommon at the time in Utah, for reasons both geographic and cultural. 

Some of Noorda&#x27;s investments were in technologies or strategies that he thought Novell should be involved in but was not, or were in companies whose products supported Novell&#x27;s products or vice versa. These companies included Coresoft Technologies, KeyLabs Inc., Vinca Corp., and Helius Inc. Another early Canopy Group investment was Nombas, which unlike the others was located in the eastern portion of the country. In addition the ups and downs of Novell&#x27;s fortunes led to executives or projects departing it and new companies being formed, some of which Canopy funded.

Subsequently the Canopy Group shifted its Novell-specific focus to one that was more geared towards open source software and network infrastructure projects in general. Noorda had an early interest in the potential of Linux and Canopy financed Caldera, Inc. starting in 1995. He subsequently financed several other Linux-related companies as well, such as Lineo and Linux Networx. Noorda and Canopy would still maintain an interest in some Novell affairs, however: in March 1998 the group&#x27;s webpage indicated that the Novell Family Trust&#x27;s 7.37 percent of Novell shares would be voted to withhold approval from most of the Novell board of directors running for re-election.

In June 1995, Noorda announced the creation of Canopy Technologies, which would provide marketing, distribution, and management services to small software companies. An early client of Canopy Technologies was Caldera, Inc. Canopy Technologies, which was based in Orem, Utah, would use an outsourcing model and take advantage of Noorda&#x27;s network of firms and know-how. In 1996, Canopy Technologies, in league with Bain Capital, placed a bid to buy the WordPerfect division from Novell (the head of Canopy Technologies was Craig Bradley, a former WordPerfect executive). However, Corel Corporation&#x27;s bid was accepted instead.

In 1996, Ralph J. Yarro III was named as the general manager of The Canopy Group. By 1998, the Canopy Group was invested in 24 different companies which in turn employed a total of around 1,000 people. Noorda became Utah&#x27;s most prominent venture capitalist. However unlike many venture capital firms, the Canopy Group under Noorda was not focused on reaching an exit strategy for its investments; instead, Yarro, said, Noorda &quot;does it because he enjoys it, and he has the ability, both intellectually and financially, to pull it off.&quot; By the early 2000s, the Canopy Group had invested in dozens of companies, with 35 firms on its active roll as of 2003.

Besides investments and management activities, the Canopy Group was also active in provided buildings for technology companies to host their offices in. Their campus for these buildings was in Lindon, Utah. While some of the tenants of these buildings were companies Canopy had invested in, including the data center provider ViaWest, over half of the tenants were not related to Canopy.

===Involvement with The SCO Group===
One of the Canopy Group&#x27;s tenants, and a company they had 43 percent ownership of, was The SCO Group. This was the renamed form of Caldera International with a new management team and approach. By 2003, the SCO Group was receiving large amounts of attention due to the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; lawsuit and the surrounding SCO–Linux controversies, in which it said that Linux had infringed upon the intellectual property rights of the Unix operating system that the SCO Group owned via its predecessor company The Santa Cruz Operation. Much of industry opinion was against the SCO Group&#x27;s legal actions. In particular reaction from the free and open source software community was intense and the SCO Group soon became, as &quot;Businessweek&quot; headlined, &quot;The Most Hated Company In Tech&quot;. 

As majority owner in the SCO Group with two seats on SCO&#x27;s board, the Canopy Group received substantial criticism as well. For instance, in July 2003, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine emphasized the role that the Canopy Group was playing and called Yarro the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; action. Columnist Frank Hayes of &quot;Computerworld&quot; examined how the SCO Group was acquiring Vultus Inc., another company controlled by Canopy, and concluded that Canopy was playing &quot;a shell game ... to move its companies around&quot; in order to exploit and cash in on the SCO Group&#x27;s rising stock price. And in October 2013, a &quot;New York Times&quot; story said that Canopy &quot;has played an important role ... in shaping SCO&#x27;s legal strategy&quot; and quoted Laura Didio, analyst for the Yankee Group, as saying &quot;All roads lead to Canopy. They&#x27;ve been pretty clever in the way they&#x27;ve played this.&quot; 

Canopy Group companies had been involved in two earlier legal actions, the winning &quot;Caldera v. Microsoft&quot; suit, which resulted in a favorable settlement in the neighborhood of $250 million, as well as a successful action on behalf of its Center 7 company against Computer Associates. Yarro said, &quot;Intellectual property is everything. It&#x27;s like location in real estate.&quot; But he reported that back in his home area in Utah, &quot;I have had friends, good friends, tell me they can&#x27;t believe what we&#x27;re doing.&quot; So to criticism regarding its role with the SCO Group, Yarro said, &quot;I know I&#x27;ve been painted in a rough light. I hope that our companies are our legacy and not our lawsuits.&quot;

===Yarro case===
Even when he was with Novell, Noorda had begun experiencing some memory lapses, a condition that was confirmed publicly at the time. By 2004, the 80-year-old Noorda was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and a bitter fight broke out between Noorda family members and Canopy Group executives. 

On 17 December 2004, Noorda and other shareholders ousted chief executive Yarro, chief financial officer Darcy Mott, and corporate counsel Brent Christensen, accusing them of having taken amounts of at least $25 million from Canopy Group through &quot;a series of self-dealing and wasteful transactions&quot;. Yarro and the other executives sued in the Utah District Courts for $100 million for wrongful termination, claiming that Noorda had been unduly influenced, and Canopy countersued the three men. Each of the opposing parties in the lawsuits accused the other of taking advantage of Noorda&#x27;s diminished state.

On 8 March 2005, the day before initial hearings were scheduled to begin, both parties negotiated a settlement out of court, ending the litigation. Yarro, Mott, and Christensen remained terminated, but an undisclosed amount of money was paid by the Canopy Group to them. Canopy agreed to relinquish ownership of all its 5.49 million shares in The SCO Group, transferring them to Yarro along with an undisclosed sum of money. Yarro thus became The SCO Group&#x27;s largest shareholder, owning about a third of it, and kept his title as chairman of its board. While SCO remained a tenant in a Canopy Group building, there was no further connection between the two firms. Yarro, Mott, and Christensen resigned from any other Canopy companies they had been involved with.

Outside of Utah, much of the news of the conflict and settlement was filtered through its possible effect on the SCO Group and SCO&#x27;s battle against Linux. 

But locally, there was an acute additional sense of loss around the conflict. There was the scene of people squabbling amidst a computer industry pioneer&#x27;s prolonged decline. And, as the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;Suicides have ended up becoming the tragic bookends for the bitter struggle to control Utah&#x27;s Canopy Group.&quot; The first was when Robert L. Penrose, Canopy&#x27;s director of information systems and technology, died of suicide in December 2004, days after becoming distraught at the ouster of Yarro and the others, and the second was when Ray Noorda&#x27;s daughter Val Noorda Kreidel, one of the major participants in the lawsuits, died of suicide in March 2005, less than a week after the settlement was reached. Looking at the whole situation, the CEO of Altiris, once a Canopy company, said, &quot;Is this a tragedy or not? Ray Noorda and Canopy ... were key to our success. In 1998, they took the risk and invested in a little company out in Lindon, Utah, when [others] would not.&quot;

=== Subsequent activities ===
Following Yarro&#x27;s removal from the Canopy Group, Canopy subsequently appointed John Noorda and Andy Noorda, Ray Noorda&#x27;s sons, to the Canopy Board of Directors. Following those appointments, John Noorda and Andy Noorda assumed control of the Canopy Group. William Mustard took over as CEO of the Canopy Group. However, there was little public activity for the next year or so, and companies with Canopy investments were unsure of what the future held. There were doubts expressed by some industry observers that the Canopy Group would even survive.

The Canopy Group at one point owned a 5.7 percent stake in Trolltech, the company which developed the Qt toolkit. After a round of investments, they withdrew those investments. Canopy also divested itself of interests in Altiris by 2005.

They then hired Ron Heinz of Canopy portfolio company Helius, a provider of satellite Internet technology, as managing director. Prior to his stint at Helius, Heinz was formerly the head of North American Sales for Novell and was responsible for building one of the Canopy Group&#x27;s profitable ventures. Brandon Tidwell became the other managing partner. Under this new leadership, the group looked to revitalize its portfolio, take a more public role towards early seed funding, and actively invest in Utah high technology companies and their development again.

Accordingly, around 2006, Canopy Venture Partners was created. This entity launched the Canopy Ventures I portfolio of companies, which invested in software and other technology companies in the Web 2.0 and network security spaces among others. In September 2006 the Canopy Group made a major investment in Solera Networks, a network security forensics firm founded in 2004 and headed by former Caldera and Lineo co-founder Bryan Sparks; it was the first investment of any significance that Canopy had made in two years. 

Ray Noorda died in October 2006 after his long battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s. By then, the Canopy Group had invested in a total of over a hundred start-up companies. And it was no longer unique, as a number of other important venture capital firms were operating in Utah as well.

In 2008, the Canopy Ventures II portfolio was announced. This had a $100 million investment fund behind it, the largest in the Canopy Group&#x27;s history, consisting of proceeds from the sale of Canopy Ventures I companies as well as new monies from the Noorda family. Canopy Ventures II invested not just in the kind of computer-related technology companies it had in the past but also in technology-focused life sciences companies. By 2011, the two portfolio funds had invested in a total of eighteen companies and exited from six of them, and according to Heinz the companies involved had gotten through the Great Recession reasonably well.

In 2011, the Canopy Group decided to exit the venture capital business and focus solely on its building management and real estate holdings business. Accordingly its technology venture arm was purchased by Signal Peak Ventures, a firm founded by Heinz, Tidwell, and others who had worked at Canopy Group. Ten companies that had been funded by the Canopy Ventures portfolios moved over to funding from the new venture. Signal Peak Ventures has continued operations into the 2020s.

The Canopy Group had stayed active in the building space as well, deciding in 2005 to add a fifth building to its Lindon campus. Canopy Properties, which employs Cushman &amp; Wakefield for its building services, has continued on into the 2020s with its five-building campus in Lindon.

<doc id="814490" wikidata="Q247297" url="?curid=814490" title="Henchman">
<text>A henchman is a loyal employee, supporter, or aide to some powerful figure engaged in nefarious or criminal enterprises. Henchmen are typically relatively unimportant in the organisation: minions whose value lies primarily in their unquestioning loyalty to their leader. The term &quot;henchman&quot; is often used derisively, or even comically, to refer to individuals of low status who lack any moral compass of their own.

The term &quot;henchman&quot; originally referred to one who attended a horse for his employer, that is, a horse groom. Hence, like &quot;constable&quot; and &quot;marshal&quot;, also originally stable staff, &quot;henchman&quot; became the title of a subordinate official in a royal court or noble household.

==Etymology==
The first part of the word, which has been in usage since at least the Middle Ages, comes from the Old English &quot;hengest&quot;, meaning &quot;horse&quot;, notably stallion, cognates of which also occur in many Germanic languages, such as Old Frisian, Danish &quot;hingst&quot;, German, Dutch &quot;hengst&quot; and Afrikaans &quot;hings&quot; [həŋs]. The word appears in the name of Hengest, the Saxon chieftain, and still survives in English in place-names and other names beginning with &quot;Hingst-&quot; or &quot;Hinx-&quot;. It was often rendered as &quot;Henxman&quot; in medieval English.

Young henchmen, in fact pages of honour or squires, rode or walked at the side of their master in processions and the like, and appear in the English royal household from the 14th century until Tudor Queen Elizabeth I abolished the &quot;royal henchmen&quot;, known also as the children of honour.

The word became obsolete for grooms in English from the middle of the 17th century, but was retained in Scots as &quot;personal attendant of a Highland chief&quot;. It was revived in English by way of the novelist Sir Walter Scott, who took the word and its derivation, according to the &quot;New English Dictionary&quot;, from Edward Burt&#x27;s &quot;Letters from a Gentleman in the North of Scotland&quot;, together with its erroneous derivation from &quot;haunch&quot;. The word is, in this sense, synonymous with gillie, the faithful personal follower of a Highland chieftain, the man who stands at his master&#x27;s haunch, ready for any emergency.

The modern sense of &quot;obedient or unscrupulous follower&quot; is first recorded 1839, probably based on a misunderstanding of the word as used by Scott, and is often used to describe an out-and-out adherent or partisan, ready to do anything.

== Modern examples ==
The phrase henchman is also used as a pejorative for any sort of political mastermind or to present others as such. Thus it was used for associates of President George W. Bush, e.g., by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. Likewise, it was also used against associates of the former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Rebekah Brooks has been described as the henchwoman of Rupert Murdoch.

Members of the SS, or any of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s staff, are often called &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Henchmen&quot;, a phrase used as the title of a book by Guido Knopp and a television documentary.

== Fictional examples ==
Henchman have been depicted in various capacities across genres of fiction, whether as low-level functionaries or capable lieutenants of major characters. Notable examples include henchmen such as Oddjob from the &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise, who was also paralleled by &quot;Random Task&quot; in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; parody film. In animation, Starscream is generally depicted as the second-in-command to the main antagonist Megatron, while more literal depictions of a henchman can be seen in the animated series &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; This includes the secondary characters Henchman 21 and 24, among other characters seen in service to the supervillians in the series.

<doc id="814513" wikidata="Q7782363" url="?curid=814513" title="Theoretical definition">
<text>A theoretical definition defines a term in an academic discipline, functioning as a proposal to see a phenomenon in a certain way. A theoretical definition is a proposed way of thinking about potentially related events. Theoretical definitions contain &quot;built-in&quot; theories; they cannot be simply reduced to describing a set of observations. The definition may contain implicit inductions and deductive consequences that are part of the theory. A theoretical definition of a term can change, over time, based on the methods in the field that created it.

Without a falsifiable operational definition, conceptual definitions assume both knowledge and acceptance of the theories that it depends on. A hypothetical construct may serve as a theoretical definition, as can a stipulative definition.

==In different fields==

===Sciences===

The term scientific theory is reserved for concepts that are widely accepted. A scientific law often refers to regularities that can be expressed by a mathematical statement. However, there is no consensus about the distinction between these terms. Every scientific concept must have an operational definition, however the operational definition can use both direct observations and latent variables.

====Natural sciences====
In the natural sciences, a concept is an abstract conclusion drawn from observations.

====Social and health sciences====
Social and health sciences interact with non-empirical fields and use both observation based and pre-existing concepts such as intelligence, race, and gender.

* In psychology the term &quot;conceptual definition&quot; is used for a concept variable.

===Interdisciplinary===
Most interdisciplinary fields are designed to address specific real world concerns and the status of theoretical definitions in interdisciplinary fields is still evolving.

==Examples==
===In natural science===
The definitions of substances as various configurations of atoms are theoretical definitions, as are definitions of colors as specific wavelengths of reflected light.

====Physics====

The first postulate of special relativity theory that the speed of light in vacuum is the same to all inertial observers (i.e. it is a constant, and therefore a good measure of length). Of interest, this theoretical concept is the basis of an operational definition for the length of a metre is &quot;the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second&quot;. Thus we have defined &#x27;metre&#x27; according to other ideas contained in modern scientific theory. Rejection of the theory underlying a theoretical definition leaves the definition invalid for use in argument with those who reject it — neither side will advance its position by using terms the others do not accept .

Heat explains a collection of various laws of nature and that predict certain results.

===In Medicine===

===In social science===

====Union ====
In psychology, the concept of intelligence is meant to explain correlations in performance on certain cognitive tasks. Recent models suggest several cognitive processes may be involved in tasks that have been associated with intelligence. However, overall the &quot;g&quot; or general intelligence factor is relatively supported by research, though there are challenges.

===Philosophy===

Differing theoretical definitions of &quot;thinking&quot; have caused conflict amongst artificial intelligence philosophers, illustrated for example by the different responses to the Chinese room experiment. Some philosophers might call &quot;thought&quot; merely &quot;having the ability to convince another person that you can think&quot;. An operational definition corresponding to this theoretical definition could be a simple conversation test (e.g. Turing test). Others believe that better theoretical and operational definitions are required.

<doc id="814517" wikidata="Q1252077" url="?curid=814517" title="Brook of Egypt">
<text>The Brook of Egypt () is a wadi identified in the Hebrew Bible as forming the southernmost border of the Land of Israel. A number of scholars in the past identified it with Wadi al-Arish, an epiphemeral river flowing into the Mediterranean sea near the Egyptian city of Arish, while other scholars, including Israeli archaeologist Nadav Na&#x27;aman and the Italian Mario Liverani believe that the Besor stream, just to the south of Gaza, is the landform referenced in the Bible. A related phrase is (&#x27;river of Egypt&#x27;), used in Genesis .

==Nahal Besor==
The Israeli archaeologist Nadav Na&#x27;aman and the Italian Mario Liverani have suggested that Wadi Gaza or Nahal Besor, was the Brook of Egypt. Certainly, it was controlled by Egypt in the Late Bronze Age and inhabited by Philistines into the Iron Age.

== Wadi al-Arish ==
According to Exodus , the locality from which the Israelites journeyed after departing Egypt was Sukkot. The name &quot;Sukkot&quot; means &quot;palm huts&quot; in Hebrew and was translated &quot;Al-Arish&quot; in Arabic. It lies in the vicinity of Arish, the hometown of the Jewish commentator Saadia Gaon who identified &quot;Naḥal Mizraim&quot; with the Wadi al-Arish. Ishtori Haparchi, in his 14th-century work &quot;Kaftor va-Ferach (Hebrew: כפתור ופרח)&quot;, also identifies the Brook of Egypt as Wadi al-Arish.

The Septuagint translates &quot;Naḥal Mizraim&quot; in Isaiah as &quot;Rhinocorura&quot;.

Although in later Hebrew the term &quot;naḥal&quot; tended to be used for small rivers, in Biblical Hebrew, the word could be used for any wadi or river valley.

According to Sara Japhet,
&quot;Nahal Mizraim&quot; is Wadi al-Arish, which empties into the Mediterranean Sea about 30 miles south of Raphia, and &quot;Shihor Mizraim&quot; is the Nile.

==Possible interpretation as the Nile==
One traditional Jewish understanding of the term &quot;Naḥal Mizraim&quot; is that it refers to the Nile. This view appears in the Palestinian Targum on Numbers 34:5, where נחלה מצרים is translated נילוס דמצריי (&quot;the Nile of the Egyptians&quot;; preserved in the Neophiti and Vatican manuscripts, as well as in Pseudo-Jonathan), in addition to medieval commentaries by Rashi and David Kimhi on Joshua 13:3. However, most commentators, such as Targum Onkelos, Abraham Ibn Ezra, Bahya ben Asher, Samuel David Luzzatto, Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin and Moisè Tedeschi on Numbers 34:5, reject this interpretation.

<doc id="814606" wikidata="Q805079" url="?curid=814606" title="Bend (heraldry)">
<text>In heraldry, a bend is a band or strap running from the upper dexter (the bearer&#x27;s right side and the viewer&#x27;s left) corner of the shield to the lower sinister (the bearer&#x27;s left side, and the viewer&#x27;s right). Authorities differ as to how much of the field it should cover, ranging from one-fifth (if shown between other charges) up to one-third (if charged alone).

==Variations==

A bend can be modified by most of the lines of partition, such as the &quot;bend engrailed&quot; in the ancient arms of Fortescue and the &quot;bend wavy&quot; in the ancient coat of Wallop, Earls of Portsmouth.

===Diminutives===
The diminutives of the bend, being narrower versions, are as follows, in descending order of width:
*Bendlet: One-half as wide as a bend, as in the ancient arms of Churchill family, and the arms of Byron. A &quot;bendlet couped&quot; is also known as a baton, as in the coat of Elliot of Stobs
*Cotise: One-fourth the width of a bend; it usually appears in pairs, one on either side (French: &quot;coté&quot;) of a bend, in which case the bend is said to be &quot;cotised&quot; as in the ancient arms of Fortescue and Bohun and in the more modern arms of Hyndburn Borough Council, England. In ancient arms it can be found on only one side of a bend blazoned as &quot;a bend singly cotised&quot;.
*Riband or ribbon: Also one-fourth the width of a bend. It is also called a cost as in the arms of Abernethie of Auchincloch (&quot;Or, a lion rampant gules surmounted of a cost sable, all within a bordure engrailed azure&quot; — first and fourth quarters)
*Scarp (or scarf): a &quot;bend sinister&quot; of one-half width.

== Bend sinister==

The usual bend is occasionally called a &quot;bend dexter&quot; when it needs to contrast with the &quot;bend sinister&quot; (Latin; means &quot;left&quot;), which runs in the other direction, like a sash worn diagonally from the left shoulder. The bend sinister and its diminutives such as the baton sinister are rare as an independent motif; they occur more often as marks of distinction. The term &quot;bar sinister&quot; is an erroneous term when used in this context, since the &quot;bar&quot; in heraldry refers to a horizontal line.

The bend sinister, reduced in size to that of a &quot;bendlet&quot; (narrow) or &quot;baton&quot; (ending short of the edge of the shield), was one of the commonest brisures (differences) added to the arms of illegitimate offspring of European aristocratic lords. Such royal descent was considered a mark of honour, and in most of Europe, illegitimate children of nobles, despite having few legal rights, were customarily regarded as noble and married within the most aristocratic families.

This was the usual mark used to identify illegitimate descendants of the English royal family dating from fifteenth century, as in the arms of Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, illegitimate son of Edward IV of England. It also appears in the arms of Antoine de Bourgogne, illegitimate son of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. The full-sized bend sinister was seldom used in this way, and more recent examples also exist of bends sinister that have no connection with illegitimacy, such as in the arms of the Burne-Jones baronets. These markings were never subject to strict rules, and the customary English use of the bend, bendlet, and baton sinister to denote illegitimacy in this way eventually gave way to the use of different kinds of bordures.

=== &quot;Bar sinister&quot;===
Sir Walter Scott is credited with inventing the phrase &quot;bar sinister&quot;, which has become a metonymic term for bastardy. Heraldry scholar Arthur Charles Fox-Davies and others state that the phrase derives from a misspelling of &quot;barre&quot;, the French term for &quot;bend sinister&quot;. The term is irregular, since in English heraldry a &quot;bar&quot; is horizontal, neither &quot;dexter&quot; nor &quot;sinister&quot;; nevertheless, &quot;bar sinister&quot; has become a standard euphemism for illegitimate birth.

==Similar elements==
===In bend===

The phrase in bend refers to the appearance of several items on the shield being lined up in the direction of a bend, as in the arms of the ancient Northcote family of Devon: &quot;Argent, three crosses-crosslet in bend sable&quot;. It is also used when something is slanted in the direction of a bend, as in the coat of Surrey County Council in England.

===Bendwise===
A charge bendwise is slanted like a bend. When a charge is placed on a bend, by default it is shown bendwise.

===Party per bend===
A shield party per bend (or simply &quot;per bend&quot;) is divided into two parts by a single line which runs in the direction of a bend. Applies not only to the fields of shields but also to charges. A division in the opposite direction is called &quot;party per bend sinister&quot;.

===Bendy===

Bendy is a variation of the field consisting (usually) of an even number of parts, most often six; as in the coat of the duchy of Burgundy.

Analogous terms are derived from the bend sinister: &quot;per bend sinister&quot;, &quot;bendwise sinister&quot;, &quot;bendy sinister&quot;.

===Engouled===
In Spanish heraldry, bends may be &quot;engouled&quot;, or swallowed, by the heads of dragons or wolves. A famous example of this is in the Royal Bend of Castile.

<text>Marians Pahars (born 5 August 1976) is a Latvian professional football manager and a former player.

As a player, he spent the majority of his career operating as a striker for English club Southampton, where he played in the Premier League and the Championship, the latter of which he played during his final season for the club. Furthermore, he had two spells at Skonto in the Latvian Higher League. He also made 75 appearances for the Latvia national team, scoring 15 goals over an eleven-year period.

Having retired from football, Pahars entered a career in coaching, starting as assistant at Skonto, which resulted in his first appointment as a manager. He went on to manage Latvia at under-21 and senior level, before returning to club management with Jelgava.

His Latvian given name is &quot;Marians&quot;; however, he was generally known as &quot;Marian&quot; during his career in England.

==Club career==

===Skonto===
Born in Chornobai in Ukraine of Latvian parents, Pahars grew up supporting Spartak Moscow. When he was about eight years old, Jurijs Andrejevs, a coach from Skonto visited his school, as a result of which Pahars decided to play football. Andrejevs was to have a major influence on Pahars’ football career.

At 18, he signed for Pardaugava Riga moving on to Skonto Metāls and then into the Skonto first-team in 1995. He started playing as a midfielder, usually on the wings, before moving into a striker&#x27;s role.

His best goal ratio came in 1995, when he scored eight in nine games, which he followed up with 12 in 28 games the following season, as he became a regular in the Latvia national team. In his prime, he was dubbed the &quot;Latvian Michael Owen&quot;.

In the 1998 season, he scored 19 goals in 26 games for Skonto, and his progress was attracting attention from bigger clubs; he had trials with Salernitana (Italy), Werder Bremen (Germany) and Casino Salzburg (Austria), but he was recommended to Southampton&#x27;s manager Dave Jones by Gary Johnson – the manager of the Latvian national team.

===Southampton===
He had a trial in a reserve team match against Oxford United on 10 February 1999 in which he scored a perfect hat-trick – a header and a goal with each foot in a 7–1 victory.

Southampton agreed a fee with Skonto of around £800,000 and, despite difficulties in obtaining a work permit and objections from the PFA, these problems were overcome and he joined the Saints in March 1999, thus becoming the first Latvian to play in the Premier League.

He finally made his debut as a 70th-minute substitute away to Coventry City on 5 April 1999, with his home debut at The Dell coming on 17 April, when he came off the bench to score the crucial equaliser – and almost got a winner – against Blackburn Rovers in a 3–3 draw. At this time, the Saints were desperately trying to survive in the Premier League, and had gone into the final game of the season needing a win to guarantee their place for a further season. Pahars scored twice in the 2–0 win over Everton at the Dell, thus securing the Saints’ status in the Premiership for the following season.

He made 33 appearances during the 1999–00 season, finishing as the club&#x27;s top scorer with 13 goals. By now, Dave Jones had been replaced as manager by Glenn Hoddle, who decided to move Pahars to a wide position, with the theory that he could scare the opposition, with his dribbling and pace, and provide for others as well as score himself.

After an impressive start to the 2000–01 season – finding the net six times as a striker, he returned to a deeper role, and his form slumped as a result. He was still a threat providing his teammates with opportunities, but his form was patchy and inconsistent and he only found the net three more times to take his tally for the season to nine goals.

After an indifferent start to the following season, he came off the bench to score the winner away to Bolton Wanderers on 15 September 2001. He scored at a regular rate over the next three months including the winner in a 1–0 victory over Charlton Athletic on 24 November – the Saints first win in their new St Mary&#x27;s Stadium.

Unfortunately, after the New Year, the goals dried up again, but he finished the season with his best total for the Saints of 16 goals in League and FA Cup. Pahars&#x27; 16 goals and 14 from strike partner James Beattie meant that the duo had the second best strike rate in the Premiership.

In the summer of 2002, Pahars required a hernia operation, which forced him to miss the whole of pre-season and although he scored a penalty in a 1–0 home win over Everton on 11 September, he never fully recovered from his injury. His early season was rather stop-start and was not helped by the suspension for receiving a red card at home to Manchester City on 5 October. He then severely injured an ankle in November 2002, which kept him out for most of the rest of the season, with another operation on the eve of the FA Cup final to round off a miserable 2002–03 season.

The start to the 2003–04 season was again hampered by injury and comebacks for the reserves were ruined by injury recurrences. He did manage to play the closing minutes, as Latvia claimed a place at Euro 2004. With that as an added incentive to get himself fully fit, he found himself back in the Saints starting line up for three successive games, which all ended in victories. His first goal of the season – and in more than a year – came at home to local rivals Portsmouth on 21 December 2003 in a 3–0 home win, when he curled a superb right footer into the bottom right corner.

After recovering from injury, he was then injured in 2004–05 pre-season in an away match at Swindon Town. A heavy, late tackle to the same ankle which had already undergone three operations ruled him out of the early part of the season. Comebacks for the reserves were promising, until problems flared up again, causing him to miss the whole of the season in frustrating circumstances, as the Saints were relegated after 28 years in the top flight of English Football.

His 2005–06 season was another frustrating one with injury after injury again seeing his comebacks ruined. He did make ten appearances during the season, scoring one goal, but it was not enough to save his Saints career, and, in May 2006, after seven years with 156 appearances and 45 goals for the club, it was announced that his contract with Southampton would not be renewed for the following season.

After the final game of the season, on 30 April 2006 Pahars took part in a &#x27;lap of appreciation&#x27; by the Saints players around the St Mary&#x27;s pitch, in an emotional goodbye for the player and many of the Southampton fans present.

===Later spells===
In July 2006 Pahars signed with Anorthosis Famagusta, a Cypriot team managed by former Georgian International Temuri Ketsbaia.

His injury problems were frequent during his stay at the club, and, as a result, in January 2008, he was released.

In 2008, he joined his former club Skonto, playing there for one season and helping the club reach good results in the national championship. After that season, he left Skonto, and joined Jūrmala, finishing his career there with two games in the national championship.

==International career==
Pahars broke into the Latvia national team at the start of 1996, and made his debut on 12 March 1996 in a 1–0 friendly defeat away to Cyprus. His first goal for his country came in his ninth match at home to Poland in a 3–2 defeat also in a friendly on 17 February 1997.

On 2 September 2006, he returned to the Latvia national team for a match against Sweden. All in all, he played 75 times and scored 15 goals for Latvia.

Despite Latvia not qualifying for the World Cup Finals they did have success in June 2001 when they beat Estonia and Lithuania, to lift the Baltic Cup, with Pahars scoring in both games. Pahars was then named Latvian Footballer of the Year for a third successive year in November 2001.

During a spell of injuries, he managed to play in the closing minutes as Latvia claimed a place in the European Championships in 2004 with a 2–2 draw in Turkey on 19 November 2003.

He again struggled for full fitness, before scoring his first goal for Latvia in a 3–1 friendly win over Kazakhstan on 18 February – his first international goal since May 2002.

With so many injury problems over the season, he was a substitute for all three of 2004 UEFA Latvia&#x27;s Group matches at Euro 2004, although he did taste the championships by coming off the bench in all three games.

==Managerial career==

===Skonto===
In 2010, Pahars accepted an offer to become Aleksandrs Starkovs&#x27; assistant at Skonto, alongside legendary Vitālijs Astafjevs. He became the champion of Latvia in 2010 once again, this time in an assistant manager&#x27;s role.

In 2011, Starkovs left for Baku in Azerbaijan and Pahars became the manager of the club. Managing the club for two seasons, he helped the club win the Baltic League in 2011 and lift the Latvian Football Cup, as well as finish as the runners-up of the Latvian Higher League in 2012.

In December 2012, Pahars left Skonto, being succeeded by Tamaz Pertia.

===Latvia===
Pahars accepted the opportunity to return to coaching, when the offer from LFF allowed him to become the manager of Latvian under-21 national team. Not long after his appointment, on 11 July 2013, Pahars was promoted, becoming the manager of the nation&#x27;s senior team, shortly after Aleksandrs Starkovs vacated his position.

As manager, Pahars guided Latvia to the 2014 and 2016 Baltic Cups. However, he failed to guide the nation to qualification to the FIFA World Cup for both the 2014 and 2018 tournaments, as well as failing for qualification to the UEFA European Championship for the 2016 tournament.

===Jelgava===
Pahars returned to Latvian domestic football, taking charge of Jelgava ahead of their 2018 Latvian Higher League campaign. He guided them to a sixth-place finish in his inaugural season in charge.

In his second season in charge, Jelgava finished in seventh place in the Latvian Higher League, a minor drop in a position from their previous league campaign, with Pahars departing the club at the end of that season.

===Siena===
On 26 January 2021, he was hired by Italian club Siena, which was in the fourth-tier Serie D at the time due to previous bankruptcy. He resigned less than a month later, on 10 February, following a negative string of results.

==Outside football==
Pahars was a candidate for Honoured to serve Riga in the 2020 Riga City Council election, but was not elected.

<doc id="814647" wikidata="Q1138346" url="?curid=814647" title="Nana (novel)">
<text>Nana is a novel by the French naturalist author Émile Zola. Completed in 1880, &quot;Nana&quot; is the ninth installment in the 20-volume &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot; series.

==Origins==
A year before he started to write &quot;Nana&quot;, Zola knew nothing about the Théâtre des Variétés. Ludovic Halévy invited him to attend an operetta with him there on February 15, 1878, and took him backstage. Halévy told him innumerable stories about the amorous life of the star, Anna Judic, whose ménage à trois served as the model for the relationships of Rose Mignon, her husband, and Steiner in Zola&#x27;s novel. Halévy also provided Zola with stories about famous prostitutes such as Blanche d&#x27;Antigny, Anna Deslions, Delphine de Lizy, and Hortense Schneider, upon which Zola drew in developing the character of his title character. Yet it was Valtesse de la Bigne, painted by both Manet and Henri Gervex, who most inspired him; it is she who is immortalised in his scandalous novel Nana.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Nana&quot; tells the story of Anna &quot;Nana&quot; Coupeau&#x27;s rise from streetwalker to high-class prostitute during the last three years of the French Second Empire. Nana first appeared near the end of &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; (1877), Zola&#x27;s earlier novel in the Rougon-Macquart series, where she is the daughter of an abusive drunk. At the conclusion of that novel, she is living in the streets and just beginning a life of prostitution.

&quot;Nana&quot; opens with a night at the Théâtre des Variétés in April 1867 just after the Exposition Universelle has opened. Nana is 18 years old, but she would have been 15 according to the family tree of the Rougon-Macquarts Zola had published years before starting work on this novel. Zola describes in detail the performance of &quot;La blonde Vénus&quot;, a fictional operetta modeled after Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;La belle Hélène&quot;, in which Nana is cast as the lead. All of Paris is talking about her, but this is her first stage appearance. When asked to say something about her talents, Bordenave, the manager of the theatre, explains that a star does not need to know how to sing or act: &quot;Nana has something else, dammit, and something that takes the place of everything else. I scented it out, and it smells damnably strong in her, or else I lost my sense of smell.&quot; Just as the crowd is about to dismiss her performance as terrible, young Georges Hugon shouts: &quot;Très chic!&quot; From then on, she owns the audience. Zola describes her appearance only thinly veiled in the third act: &quot;All of a sudden, in the good-natured child the woman stood revealed, a disturbing woman with all the impulsive madness of her sex, opening the gates of the unknown world of desire. Nana was still smiling, but with the deadly smile of a man-eater.&quot;

In the course of the novel Nana destroys every man who pursues her: Philippe Hugon is imprisoned after stealing from the army to lend Nana money; the wealthy banker Steiner bankrupts himself trying to please her; Georges Hugon stabs himself with scissors in anguish over her; Vandeuvres incinerates himself after Nana ruins him financially; Fauchery, a journalist and publisher who falls for Nana early on, writes a scathing article about her later, and falls for her again and is ruined financially; and Count Muffat, whose faithfulness to Nana brings him back for humiliation after humiliation until he finds her in bed with his elderly father-in-law. In George Becker&#x27;s words: &quot;What emerges from &quot;[Nana]&quot; is the completeness of Nana&#x27;s destructive force, brought to a culmination in the thirteenth chapter by a kind of roll call of the victims of her voracity&quot;.

Zola has Nana die a horrible death in July 1870 from smallpox. She disappears, her belongings are auctioned and no one knows where she is. It comes out that she has been living with a Russian prince, leaving her infant son in the care of an aunt near Paris, but when a smallpox epidemic breaks out she returns to nurse him; he dies, and she catches the disease. Zola suggests that her true nature, concealed by her physical beauty, has come to the surface. &quot;What lay on the pillow was a charnel house, a heap of pus and blood, a shovelful of putrid flesh. The pustules had invaded the whole face, so that one pock touched the next&quot;. Outside her window the crowd is madly cheering &quot;To Berlin! To Berlin!&quot; to greet the start of the Franco-Prussian War, which will end in defeat for France and the end of the Second Empire.

==Reception==
The novel was an immediate success. &quot;Le Voltaire&quot;, the French newspaper that was planning to publish it in installments beginning in October 1879, launched a gigantic advertising campaign, raising the curiosity of the reading public to a fever pitch. When Charpentier finally published &quot;Nana&quot; in book form in February 1880, the first edition of 55,000 copies was sold out in one day. Flaubert and Edmond de Goncourt were full of praise for &quot;Nana&quot;. On the other hand, a part of the public and some critics reacted to the book with outrage, which may have contributed to its popularity.

Flaubert wrote Zola an effusive letter praising the novel in detail. He reported which pages he had marked by turning down their corners and praising specific passages (&quot;everything about Fontane, perfect!&quot;). In summation he wrote: &quot;Nana tourne au mythe, sans cesser d&#x27;être réelle&quot;. (Nana turns into myth, without ceasing to be real.)

As a counterargument to Zola&#x27;s depiction of the significance of heredity and environment, Alfred Sirven (1838-1900) and Henri Leverdier (1840- ) wrote a novel called &quot;Nana&#x27;s Daughter: A Story of Parisian Life&quot; (1880). Published in both French and English versions, it told the story of Nana&#x27;s daughter, who rises from &quot;the gutter&quot; and overcomes her background to become a respectable lady.

==Later references==
Édouard Manet, who was much taken with the description of the &quot;precociously immoral&quot; Nana in Zola&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; gave the title &quot;Nana&quot; to his portrait of Henriette Hauser before &quot;Nana&quot; was published.
The word &quot;nana&quot; has become, in contemporary French, &quot;a mildly rude French term for woman, comparable to broad&quot;. Niki de Saint Phalle called a series of her sculptures &quot;Nanas&quot;. They were &quot; bulbous, archetypal maternal figures like Mexican piñatas painted in bold colors and decorated with crisp, cartoon outlines&quot;. She explained that her title evoked the prototype of the female: &quot;Eve! Aphrodite! Nana de Zola! Inusable! Increvable!&quot; (Eve! Aphrodite! Zola&#x27;s Nana! Everlasting! Indestructible!).

<doc id="814652" wikidata="Q909455" url="?curid=814652" title="Black carp">
<text>The black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) or Chinese black roach is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the family Xenocyprididae, the East Asian minnows or sharpbellies. The black carp is the sole extant species of the genus &quot;Mylopharyngodon&quot;. It is native to lakes and rivers in East Asia, ranging from the Amur Basin across China to Vietnam. One of the largest cyprinids in the world, the black carp has a typical length of , though it can reach up to in length and in weight. It is carnivorous and generally feeds on invertebrates such as snails, clams and mussels.

Black carp, together with bighead carp, silver carp, and grass carp, make up the culturally important &quot;four famous domestic fishes&quot; used in polyculture in China for over a thousand years. It has also been introduced in the United States as one of the invasive &quot;Asian carps&quot;, though it is not as widely distributed worldwide as the other three.

In China, black carp is widely cultivated for food and Chinese medicine, being one of the most highly esteemed and expensive domestic food fish, and partly because of its diet and limited food supply, is the most scarce and expensive in the marketplace among the &quot;four famous domestic fishes&quot;.
==Description==
Black carp are elongated fish with a fusiform body. They appear dusky gray, brown or bluish black and have dark fins. Their dorsal fin is high and pointed. In comparison to grass carp, the distances from the eye to the superior and inferior edges of the pre-operculum are respectively longer, contributing to the elongate appearance of the scaleless head. Unlike in grass carp, the upper lip does not appear to protrude beyond the lower lip when viewed from above with the fish&#x27;s mouth closed. Black carp have large cycloid scales on their body and a forked tail fin behind a broad caudal peduncle.

==Black carp in the United States==
The black carp was first accidentally introduced into the United States during a grass carp shipment from Asia in the 1970s. The black carp was later intentionally introduced to the US in the 1980s for use in retention ponds and aquaculture facilities to manage yellow grub and snails populations. It was also to be used as food fish. However, flooding in the South caused these populations of carp to spread into the Mississippi watershed. They continued to spread via the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, where they began to form wild populations. Black carp later began to migrate to connected river systems, and spread via continued flooding events. Aside from this, the population was also introduced via human release.

The nature of the black carp&#x27;s diet has led to its use in the United States in the control of snails in aquaculture. Snails are obligate alternate hosts of trematode pests that can cause substantial losses to aquaculture crops. Some state aquaculture laws require the carp to be bred as triploids, to render them sterile, thus minimizing the potential for the fish to escape and create self-sustaining populations. The use of triploids, though, does require the maintenance and use of fertile diploid brood stock at least at some location for production of the triploids.

Many mechanical control methods have been used to control the population of Asian carp, including use of noise, walls of bubbles, netting and even explosions, but these have only succeeded in slowing the spread of carp. The most effective methods, such as chemical poisoning, are successful at killing carp, but also affect other fish in the body of water, further disrupting the ecosystem.

Currently, novel control methods are being researched that use carp pheromones to control their behavior. Another widespread effort involves using carp as a food source. Locals in areas where carp have invaded are encouraged to catch and eat them.
Efforts to prevent Asian carp from spreading to crucial ecosystems such as the Great Lakes or waterways on the West Coast are ongoing. Local laws prevent human release of these fish in these waterways, and population controls have also contributed to this success. No state allows the intentional release of black carp, sterile or otherwise, but the United States Geological Survey reports that more than 60 confirmed black carp have been caught in the Mississippi River basin. This basin is the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent. The Mississippi River spans 2320 miles, while the entire system covers 1,151,000 sq mi. The presence of black carp within this enormous river system means that this highly invasive species has access to a vast range of bodies of water covering the majority of the Midwestern United States. Rivers where black carp have been captured also include the White in Arkansas, the Atchafalaya and Red in Louisiana, and the Kaskaskia and Illinois Rivers in Illinois. One confirmed escape of black carp from aquaculture has occurred on the Osage River in Missouri, but other escapes are likely, because most early captures were far from this location, in the southern Mississippi basin. Most of the captured fish have been confirmed to be diploid and assumed fertile. Two diploid fingerlings were captured near Cape Girardeau, Missouri in 2016, a sign of natural reproduction of this species in the wild. In Louisiana, many other reports by knowledgeable fishers of their capture have not been verified by biologists.

Black carp are considered to be a serious threat to mollusks native to the United States, many of which are critically endangered. In 2007, the black carp was listed as an &quot;injurious species&quot; under the Lacey Act of 1900. Transporting live black carp, whether sterile or fertile, into the United States or across state lines is thus illegal in most cases.

==Anatomy and physiology==
Black carp have enameloid teeth located in the posterior pharynx between the cleithral bones. There are four teeth on the left side and five teeth on the right side of the pharynx in adults. As the black carp prepare to crush shelled prey, they forcibly occlude their pharyngeal teeth. A horny patch above the pharyngeal teeth helps to position and hold the prey in place as it is crushed. The pharyngeal teeth will be replaced multiple times during the life of the carp.

==Etymology==
Generic name from Greek &quot;mill&quot; + New Latin &quot;throat&quot; + Greek &quot;tooth&quot;. Specific name from Latin &quot;pitch-black.&quot;

<text>Alberto Díaz Gutiérrez (September 14, 1928 – May 25, 2001), better known as Alberto Korda or simply Korda, was a Cuban photographer, remembered for his famous image &quot;Guerrillero Heroico&quot; of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.

==Early life==
Korda, whose real name was Alberto Díaz Gutiérrez, was born on September 14, 1928, in Havana, Cuba. He got his first taste of photography when he took his father&#x27;s Kodak 35mm and began taking pictures of his girlfriend. Korda was the son of a railway worker, and took many jobs before beginning as a photographer&#x27;s assistant. Korda began his career as a photographer who shot pictures at banquets, baptisms and weddings. He would run back to his studio to develop the film, then return to the event and sell his photographs as souvenirs. The quality of Korda&#x27;s work as a beginner was very poor; after a few months the image became blurry and the paper yellowed. When he opened his first studio, Korda had an opportunity to learn from his mistakes and to stop the yellowing process by using the right chemicals for the correct durations of time. In 1953, Korda opened his first studio with a photographer named Luis Pierce. Initially, Korda and Pierce took a variety of jobs ranging from fashion to advertisements.

Most of the jobs were photographed by his studio partner, to keep their business going. It was the money generated by these jobs that allowed Korda to develop his unique style of looking at an image from another angle, different from the traditional photographers&#x27; studios. It was this style that Studios Korda quickly became identified with achieving. In the early years, Korda was most interested in fashion because it allowed him to pursue his two favorite things, photography and beautiful women. Korda became Cuba&#x27;s premiere fashion photographer.

Korda disliked artificial lighting; he said it was &quot;a travesty of reality&quot; and only used natural light in his studio. He was master of black-and-white photography who looked for perfect composition and framing. Korda had unique creative ambition that he used to rise above in style when compared to the unimaginative cultural perspective of traditional Cuban photography. This unique creativity turned the Korda Studio into something more than just a prosperous business; it became an art studio. &quot;My main aim was to meet women&quot;, he once confessed. His second wife, Natalia (Norka) Menendez, was a well known Cuban fashion model.

==Cuban Revolution==
The relationship between Fidel Castro and Korda could not be defined by one label or title. For Castro, Korda was more than an official photographer, a friend or personal photographer. They never discussed salary or title, their relationship wasn&#x27;t boss and worker. Korda was very relaxed, and interested in everything and everyone. Every photo he took was a symbol of the revolution, instead of a documentary of the events of the revolution. The Cuban Revolution was the turning point in Korda&#x27;s career; his career plans were completely changed with the success of the revolutionaries. In 1959 the newly established newspaper offered the largest space for photographers to display their photographs, and Korda became part of the revolutionary cause. Korda Says, &quot;Nearing 30, I was heading toward a frivolous life when an exceptional event transformed my life: The Cuban Revolution. It was at this time that I took this photo of a little girl, who was clutching a piece of wood for a doll. I came to understand that it was worth dedicating my work to a revolution which aimed to remove these inequalities.&quot; He got caught up in the ideals of the revolution and began photographing its leaders. As photographer of the Revolution, Korda always worked at his own photographic tempo; he wasn&#x27;t pushed by the press or by any other requests. Wherever the revolution took Castro, Korda followed. One of Korda&#x27;s most recognizable images was of Castro&#x27;s visit to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., in April 1959. Castro&#x27;s travels took Korda all around Cuba, overseas, and the Soviet Union. In 1963 photos of Fidel and Nikita Khrushchev, taken by Korda, illustrated the differences in both men that were evident in their respective politics.

In 1959 Fidel went back to the Sierra Maestra, the remote mountain region, where the revolutionary army began its attacks on the army of the Batista Regime. Korda&#x27;s style was to move to the front of whatever group Fidel was leading to get the shots he wanted. When Korda came back to his home, his daughter barely recognized him: his hair and beard were long and he hadn&#x27;t showered for months. Korda took many pictures for the newspaper and called the series &quot;Fidel Returns to the Sierra.&quot; Fidel always liked Korda&#x27;s photos and never stopped him when he attempted to take his picture. He worked freely without thinking about political consequences to get what he wanted in his photos.


Korda was a photographer for the Cuban newspaper &quot;Revolución&quot; when he produced on March 5, 1960, the iconic image of Che Guevara that became a worldwide symbol of revolution and rebellion. He never received any royalties for the image, because Castro did not recognize the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. In 2000, he sued Smirnoff (Lowe Lintas) over the use of the image in advertisement. Commenting on the illicit use of his photograph, the artist said, &quot;As a supporter of the ideals for which Che Guevara died, I am not averse to its reproduction by those who wish to propagate his memory and the cause of social justice throughout the world, but I am categorically against the exploitation of Che&#x27;s image for the promotion of products such as alcohol, or for any purpose that denigrates the reputation of Che.&quot; His out-of-court settlement of US $50,000 was donated to the Cuban healthcare system. He said, &quot;If Che were still alive, he would have done the same.&quot; However, he told a BBC World Service reporter that he did approve of the 1999 Che Jesus adaptation of the image used by the Churches Advertising Network to promote church attendance in the UK. The truth is that Korda gave the picture for free to Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, an Italian publisher who had published &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; and went on to publish Castro&#x27;s diaries.

After the revolution, Korda became Fidel Castro&#x27;s personal photographer for 10 years, accompanying Castro on trips and in meetings with foreign personalities. During this time he also took pictures of demonstrations, sugar cane harvests and factory scenes. Other less-known Fidel Castro images by Korda include shots of Castro staring warily at a tiger in a New York zoo, playing golf and fishing with Che Guevara, skiing and hunting in Russia, and with Ernest Hemingway. Korda&#x27;s work also includes pictures of Castro&#x27;s rebels riding into Havana after their triumph, and one known as &quot;The Quixote of the Lamp Post&quot; showing a Cuban wearing a straw hat and sitting on a lamp post against a sea of people during a rally.

==Later life and death==

From 1968 to 1978 he concentrated on underwater photography until a Japanese exhibition in 1978 stimulated international interest in his work. He appeared briefly in the pre-title sequence of Wim Wenders&#x27; film &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; in 1999, although he was uncredited.

Korda suffered a fatal heart attack in Paris in 2001 while presenting an exhibition of his work. He is buried in the Colon Cemetery, Havana.

He was featured in a full feature documentary titled Kordavision directed by Hector Cruz Sandoval in 2006 which was selected by AMPAS 2007 documentary series.

In September 2016 the Leica camera that Korda used for his famous photograph of Che Guevara was auctioned through the online auction house Catawiki for €18,100.

==Korda&#x27;s Family lawsuit against Bruce Labruce&#x27;s &quot;The Raspberry Reich&quot;==

In 2005 Bruce Labruce&#x27;s producer Jürgen Brüning and Labruce himself were sued by the estate of Korda for a million dollars over the use of Korda&#x27;s famous photo of Che &quot;Guerrillero Heroico&quot; in Labruce&#x27;s movie &quot;The Raspberry Reich&quot;.

In an interview from 2018 the Canadian filmmaker talked about the lawsuit:

It played at over a hundred film festivals and was on its way to becoming a cult hit when, about six months into my tour with the film, Jurgen and I got hit with a million dollar (Canadian) lawsuit for copyright infringement by the Korda estate.

The lawsuit was launched in France, which has some of the toughest copyright laws in the world, but the sixty-page court document was delivered to my door in Toronto by a local sheriff, so it was pretty heavy. We got a famous gay French lawyer, Emmanuel Pierrat, to defend us, but we technically lost. The damages were reduced to about €8,000, but we had to cover the court costs, so we ended up having to pay about €30,000 (the budget of the film was about 60,000!), effectively erasing all our profits from the film.

&#x27;The film is a critique of radical chic and both a critique and celebration of the radical left, but it is obviously anti-capitalist, so the irony of being scuttled by Che and Korda over copyright was bitter.

They argued mostly that we &quot;demeaned&quot; and &quot;defiled&quot; the image of Che, although I didn&#x27;t really intend having a hot porn star jerk off on a blow-up of the Che image to be demeaning at all – more of an homage, really. I just figured everyone else in the world was jerking off to the image, so I might as well show it literally.

The film&#x27;s slogans, particularly &quot;The Revolution is My Boyfriend,&quot; started to be widely quoted online and on t-shirts and banners, neatly mirroring the radical chic critiqued in the movie.

<doc id="814701" wikidata="Q2907564" url="?curid=814701" title="Bob Allison">
<text>William Robert Allison (July 11, 1934 – April 9, 1995) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), with the Washington Senators / Minnesota Twins.

Allison attended the University of Kansas for two years and was a star outfielder on the baseball team and fullback on the football team. In his Major League career, he hit 30 or more home runs three times and 20 or more in eight different seasons. Although he struck out often like many sluggers, reaching the century mark in strikeouts in five seasons, he received more than his share of walks and despite a mediocre career .255 batting average, Allison finished with a lifetime on-base percentage (OBP) of .358 and he finished in the top 10 in OBP in four seasons. Allison wasn&#x27;t an especially fast player, but he was among the most feared base-runners of his time in hustling out numerous doubles and triples – leading the league in triples in 1959 (with 9) and finishing in the top 10 twice in doubles (1960 &amp; 1964) and four times in triples (1959, 1962, 1967, and 1968).

At the three outfield positions he showed good range, finishing in the top five in range factor per nine innings five times, and his strong arm was rated as one of the best in the league. He also played a solid first base late at his career and his competitive attitude was highly praised by teammates and opponents. Despite his skill in the field, which saw him finish in the top 5 in the American League in outfield assists three times (1961, 1962, and 1965) and outfield putouts twice (1959 and 1963), he also produced many errors and Allison led the league with 11 errors in 1960, finished second twice (1959 and 1963), and finished fourth in errors by a first baseman in 1964.

== Early life ==
Allison was born on July 11, 1934 in Raytown, Missouri to Robert and Frances (Witte) Allison, the oldest of three children. His father was a former semi-pro baseball catcher. He attended Raytown High School where he starred in football at quarterback and fullback, as well as in basketball and track. The school did not have a baseball team, and he played baseball in the Ban Johnson League, in the Kansas City, Missouri area.

After graduating in 1952, he entered the University of Kansas on a football scholarship, and played baseball as well under coach Floyd Temple. He continued to play baseball in the Ban Johnson League in the summers of 1952-1954. He was scouted by a number of major league baseball teams, and in the fall of 1954 when he lost his eligibility to play sports because of his grades, decided to leave Kansas for professional baseball.

==Baseball career==
After leaving the University of Kansas at the age of 20, Allison was signed by the Senators as an amateur free agent before the start of the 1955 season. After signing, he was assigned to the Hagerstown Packets of the B-level Piedmont League where he hit only .256 in 122 games. The following year, he was promoted to the Charlotte Hornets in the single-A South Atlantic League. His roommate was Harmon Killebrew, future Senators and Twins teammate and a lifelong friend. Although he improved his power numbers, hitting 12 home runs and 6 triples, his batting average dipped to .233. Allison then spent 1957 and 1958 playing for the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Double-A Southern League and he raised batting average and slugging percentage to .307 and .446 respectively in 1958 (both highs in his minor league career). On September 16, 1958, Allison made his major league debut, batting lead-off, and got a single in four at-bats in a 5–1 loss to the Cleveland Indians.

In , Allison went north with the Senators and he batted .261 with 30 home runs and 85 runs batted in; leading the league in triples (9), while fifth in stolen bases (13). He was named to the All-Star team, received a smattering of MVP votes, and was honored by being voted Rookie of the Year. Allison experienced a &quot;sophomore slump&quot; in 1960 with an across-the-board drop in his offensive statistics. However, he came back strong in 1961, hitting 29 home runs – including three grand slams – with 105 RBI, although his batting average dropped for the second year in a row, to .245. The Senators moved to Minnesota in . Allison hit the first home run in Twins history off future hall of fame Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford. On April 16, 1961 in Baltimore, he hit the first grand slam home run in Twins history, as well as a three-run home run in the same game. 

Allison became a local favorite and along with teammate Harmon Killebrew made one of the most dangerous one-two punches in baseball. In 1961, they combined for 75 home runs, 80 in 1963, and 81 in 1964. In a July 18, 1962 game against the Cleveland Indians, they each hit a grand slam home run in the first inning. They were known as &quot;Mr. Upstairs&quot; (Killebrew) and &quot;Mr. Downstairs&quot; (Allison). 
In , Allison had 25 doubles, 35 home runs, 91 RBI, led the league in runs scored (99) and in OPS (.911), and earned his second All-Star berth. In addition, he became the first of four Twins to lead the league in WAR, a stat that measures a player&#x27;s overall production both in the field and at the plate. Other Twins leading the league in WAR include Zoilo Versalles, Rod Carew, and Joe Mauer, all of whom were named MVP in the seasons they did so. Only Allison did not win the MVP in the same season (finishing a distant 15th behind winner Elston Howard and behind teammates Camilo Pascual, Earl Battey, and Killebrew on the 1963 ballot). 

He followed this up in with a 32-home run 86 RBI performance that got him named to his third and final All-Star team, this time at first base. The next year, Allison suffered a broken left hand when he was hit by a pitch. Records reflect that he played in 135 games in 1965, in a 162 game season, playing 68 games after returning from the injury. In 1966, he was again hit by a pitch that broke his wrist, and played in only 70 games, but returned at the end of the season to knock a pinch-hit three-run homer against the New York Yankees on September 18, 1966. 

During the Twins&#x27; 1965 World Series season, Allison had a down year, after suffering a fractured wrist on July 6th, hitting only .233 in 135 games. Before the injury he was hitting .267 with 12 home runs and 34 RBI, and after returning he hit .199 with 11 home runs and 44 RBI. He continued his poor production versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, reaching base only 4 times (two walks, a double, and a home run in a game 6 win) and striking out 9 times in 16 at-bats, the last of which was against Sandy Koufax for the final out in Game 7 of the 1965 World Series. However, he had a memorable Game 2 of the Series. His bases-loaded double against Koufax and a great backhand diving catch of a Jim Lefebvre fly ball were the main contributors to the Twins victory. This catch has been called the best catch in Twins history and one of the most spectacular catches seen in World Series history. 

Allison&#x27;s slide at the plate continued into the 1966 season. His wrist was again fractured when he was hit by a pitch from Jim Lonborg. He played in only 70 games and hit .233. However, he returned in a big way in 1967, hitting .258 with 24 home runs with 75 RBI in a year which the league batting average was only .236.

In 13 seasons, Allison finished in the top ten in home runs eight times (1959, 1961–65, 1967–68). Particularly memorable home run feats included combining with Harmon Killebrew to become the first pair to hit grand slams in the same inning on July 18, 1962, hitting home runs in three consecutive at-bats on May 17, 1963, and teaming with Killebrew, Tony Oliva, and Jimmie Hall to hit four consecutive home runs on May 2, 1964.

==Retirement==
During his baseball career, he worked during the off season in sales for Coca-Cola Bottling Midwest Co. in suburban Minneapolis. After retirement, he continued with that business, becoming a plant manager and a sales manager for Coca-Cola&#x27;s Twin Cities Marketing Division. Thirteen years after his retirement, Allison began noticing problems with his coordination during a 1987 old-timers game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Running and even catching the ball became difficult. Following two years of doctor visits to learn what was wrong, the diagnosis was finally made — Allison was suffering from a progressive sporadic ataxia known as Olivo-Ponto cerebellar atrophy. 

In 1990, Allison helped found the Bob Allison Ataxia Research Center at the University of Minnesota along with his wife Betty, sons Mark, Kirk, and Kyle, and former Twins&#x27; teammates Jim Kaat and Frank Quilici. He continued to battle this rare degenerative neurological disease for eight years, eventually losing his ability to walk, talk, write, and feed himself. Allison died of complications from ataxia on April 9, 1995, at the age of 60 in his Rio Verde, Arizona, home.

Following his death, the Minnesota Twins created the Bob Allison Award for the Twins player who exemplifies determination, hustle, tenacity, competitive spirit and leadership both on and off the field.

<text>Charles Herbert &quot;Red&quot; Ruffing (May 3, 1905 – February 17, 1986) was an American professional baseball player. A pitcher, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1924 through 1947. He played for the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Chicago White Sox. Ruffing is most remembered for his time with the highly successful Yankees teams of the 1930s and 1940s.

Ruffing dropped out of school as a child to work in a coal mine in his native Illinois. He played for the mine&#x27;s company baseball team as an outfielder and first baseman. After he lost four toes from his left foot in a mining accident, he became unable to run in the field, and switched to pitching. He played in minor league baseball in 1923 and 1924 before making his MLB debut with the Red Sox. After struggling with Boston, pitching to a 39–96 win–loss record, the Red Sox traded Ruffing to the Yankees, where he became successful, pitching as the Yankees&#x27; ace through 1946. After one season with the White Sox, Ruffing retired from pitching to work in coaching. He served as a bullpen coach for the White Sox, a pitching coach for the New York Mets.

Ruffing was a member of six World Series championship teams with the Yankees. He also appeared in six MLB All-Star Games. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1967. The Yankees dedicated a plaque to Ruffing in Monument Park in 2004.

==Early life==
Charles Herbert Ruffing was born on May 3, 1905, in Granville, Illinois. He was one of five children of John and Frances Ruffing, who emigrated to the United States from Germany. Ruffing was raised in Coalton and Nokomis, Illinois. He went to school in Nokomis. His father was a coal miner, working in a mine in Coalton until he suffered a broken back. John became the superintendent of the mine, and also served as mayor of Coalton.

Red quit school at the age of 13 to work for his father in the mine, earning $3 per day ($ in current dollar terms), working as a coupler. Conditions in the mine were dangerous. Red&#x27;s cousin, who also worked in the mine, died in an accident. He also played baseball as an outfielder and first baseman for the mine&#x27;s company team, and for a semi-professional team in Nokomis.

When Ruffing was 15 years old, he suffered an accident in the mine, where his left foot was crushed between two cars. Though the doctor was able to save his foot, Red lost four toes. He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but he found himself unable to run as fast as he previously could. Doc Bennett, the manager of a nearby semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues (1923–24)===
Bennett helped arrange for Ruffing to sign his first professional contract when he reached the age of 18. Ruffing signed with the Danville Veterans of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, a minor league baseball team in the Class B designation level. With Danville, Ruffing had a 12–16 win–loss record. After pitching for Danville in the 1923 season, the Boston Red Sox purchased Ruffing from Danville for $4,000 ($ in current dollar terms).

The Red Sox assigned Ruffing to the Dover Senators of the Class D Eastern Shore League to pitch at the start of the 1924 season. He had a 4–7 record for Dover.

===Major leagues===

====Boston Red Sox (1924–1930)====

Ruffing made his major league debut with the Red Sox on May 31, 1924. He pitched without earning a decision in over 23 innings pitched, and had a 6.65 earned run average (ERA). He saw regular playing time with the Red Sox over the next few years but had limited success. He had a 9–18 win–loss record with a 5.01 ERA in the 1925 season, as the Red Sox finished in last place in the eight team American League (AL). Ruffing had a 6–15 win–loss record and a 4.39 ERA in the 1926 season, and a 5–13 win–loss record with a 4.66 ERA in the 1927 season, with the Red Sox finishing in last place both years. His best season to date, in terms of earned run performance, came in 1928, when he posted a 3.89 ERA. However, he led the AL in earned runs allowed, with 125, and had a 10–25 win–loss record, which led the AL in losses. On a positive note, he also led the AL with 25 complete games. As Ruffing had a .314 batting average during the 1928 season, the Red Sox and Ruffing considered having him shift to the outfield. The team decided against a position change due to the limitations of Ruffing&#x27;s left foot.

The Red Sox chose Ruffing to be their Opening Day starting pitcher for the 1929 season. During the 1929 season, he again led the AL in losses, with 22, and earned runs, with 135. He won only nine games. Ruffing often had difficulty pitching more than five innings in a game. Someone in the Red Sox organization suggested to Ruffing that he should try to gain weight by drinking beer, which saw him grow from 185 pounds (84 kg) to 240 pounds (110 kg).

During the 1930 season, Bob Quinn, the owner of the Red Sox, was in debt and afraid he would lose the team due to foreclosure. To raise capital, he traded Ruffing to the New York Yankees for reserve outfielder Cedric Durst, $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and a $50,000 loan from Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees&#x27; owner. Ruffing ended his -year tenure with the Red Sox with a 39–96 win–loss record; his winning percentage (.289) was lower than that of the Red Sox during his tenure (.344).

====New York Yankees====

=====1930–1938=====
Miller Huggins, who served as the Yankees&#x27; manager through 1929, had attempted to acquire Ruffing from the Red Sox for the last couple years of his Yankees&#x27; tenure. When Ruffing told him that he was considering moving to the outfield, Huggins told him he should continue as a pitcher. Bob Shawkey, a former pitcher who succeeded Huggins as the Yankees new manager in 1930, had convinced Ed Barrow, the Yankees&#x27; general manager, to acquire Ruffing. Shawkey believed he could change Ruffing&#x27;s approach to pitching to obtain better results. Shawkey worked with Ruffing to change his pitching delivery, so that Ruffing used his body more. This helped Ruffing save his arm strength for the later innings of the game. The trade of Ruffing for Durst is now reckoned as one of the most lopsided trades in baseball history; Durst was a reserve outfielder who always batted at the bottom of the lineup when he was used. The 1930 season proved to be Durst&#x27;s worst year in the majors. Ruffing had a 0–3 record with the Red Sox before the trade. He won 15 games for the Yankees after the trade, losing only five games.

The Yankees chose Ruffing as their starting pitcher for Opening Day in 1931. During the 1931 season, Ruffing had a 16–14 win–loss record with a 4.41 ERA. The Yankees finished the season in second place. On August 13, 1932, Ruffing threw a complete-game shutout and hit a home run in the tenth inning off of Washington Senators&#x27; pitcher Tommy Thomas to give the New York Yankees a 1–0 victory. Ruffing became the first pitcher in major league history to win a game 1–0, hit a home run in the game, and strike out ten or more batters. Three other pitchers have since achieved this feat: Early Wynn in 1957, Yovani Gallardo, who did it in 2009, and Noah Syndergaard, who did it on May 2, 2019. Ruffing won 18 games during the 1932 season. He had a 3.09 ERA, second in the AL only to Lefty Grove&#x27;s 2.84. Ruffing had 190 strikeouts, which led the AL. The Yankees won their first pennant since 1928. Ruffing won his first World Series game during the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. He started Game One, and the Yankees swept the Cubs four games to zero.
Ruffing had a 9–14 win–loss record with a 3.91 ERA in the 1933 season, as the Yankees finished in second place in the AL. He threw a one-hitter on June 20, 1934, against the Cleveland Indians. Two weeks later, Joe Cronin selected Ruffing for the 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. At that point, he had a 9–3 win–loss record on the season. He finished the season with a 19–11 win–loss record, as the Yankees finished second in the AL. Ruffing pitched to a 16–11 record in the 1935 season, as the Yankees again finished second in the AL. His 3.12 ERA was third in the league, behind only Grove and Ted Lyons.

Ruffing won 20 games during the 1936 season. In June of that year, Ruffing pitched the longest outing by a New York Yankees pitcher, logging 16 innings in a complete game win against the Cleveland Indians. His 3.85 ERA was the sixth-best in the league, and his 20 wins tied him for third place, with Johnny Allen and Wes Ferrell, behind Tommy Bridges and Vern Kennedy. He started Game One of the 1936 World Series against the New York Giants, but lost. The Yankees defeated the Giants four games to two. In a salary dispute with the Yankees, Ruffing did not report to spring training, and he held out at the start of the 1937 season, missing the first month. He signed in May, receiving a $15,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms). Ruffing had a 20–7 win–loss record for the Yankees in 1937. He finished with the fourth-best ERA in the league, 2.98, trailing Lefty Gomez, Monty Stratton, and Allen, and his 20 wins were second only to Gomez, who had 21. His performance earned him eighth place in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting. He started Game Two in the 1937 World Series, earning the victory, as the Yankees defeated the Giants four games to one.

The Yankees started Ruffing on Opening Day for the 1938 season. He was again named an All-Star during the 1938 season. Yankees&#x27; manager Joe McCarthy, who managed the AL team in the All-Star Game, chose teammate Lefty Gomez as the starting pitcher. As McCarthy did not believe in pitching two players from the same team in an All-Star Game, Ruffing did not appear in the game. He led the AL with 21 wins in the 1938 season. He also tied for the AL lead in shutouts during with three, while his 3.31 ERA was third-best in the league, behind only Grove. Ruffing pitched the opening game of the 1938 World Series against the Cubs. He won two games in the series as the Yankees defeated the Cubs. Ruffing finished fourth in AL MVP voting for the 1938 season.

=====1939–1946=====
McCarthy named Ruffing to be the starting pitcher for the Yankees on Opening Day in 1939. McCarthy, managing the AL All-Star team that year, also selected Ruffing as his starter for the 1939 MLB All-Star Game. He missed several weeks late in the 1939 season due to an arm injury, but managed to start Game One of the 1939 World Series. He defeated the Cincinnati Redlegs in that game, and the Yankees won the series in a four-game sweep. Ruffing won 21 games during the 1939 season. His four shutouts in the 1939 season again tied him for the AL lead, while he finished second in wins behind Bob Feller, and fourth in ERA (2.93) behind Grove, Lyons, and Feller. He finished fifth in the balloting for the AL MVP.

Ruffing was the Yankees&#x27; Opening Day starting pitcher in 1940. He was named to the 1940 All-Star team, and Cronin, acting as manager, selected Ruffing as his starting pitcher. Ruffing finished the season with a 15–12 win–loss record. Ruffing was a member of the 1941 All-Star team as well, but he did not pitch in the game. He had a 15–6 win–loss record during the 1941 season, and was named the starting pitcher for Game One of the 1941 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Ruffing defeated the Dodgers, as the Yankees won the series four games to one.
Ruffing pitched for the Yankees during Opening Day of the 1942 season. That year, he compiled a 14–7 win–loss record. He was again named an All-Star, and again did not pitch in the All-Star Game, which was started by teammate Spud Chandler. Though teammate Tiny Bonham had a better season, pitching to a 21–5 win–loss record, McCarthy again chose Ruffing as his Game One starter for the 1942 World Series, setting a record with six World Series Game One starts that stood until Whitey Ford started his seventh Game One in the 1963 World Series. Ruffing defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in Game One, his seventh World Series victory. This set a record that was surpassed by Ford in 1960. Ruffing pitched again in the Game Five, with the Yankees down three games to one. Ruffing lost the game, as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees to win the series.

After the 1942 season, Ruffing took a job with Vultee Aircraft, a defense contractor. Despite his age (37) and missing toes, a United States Army doctor certified Ruffing as Class 1-B in the Selective Service System, overruled Ruffing&#x27;s personal physician, who had ruled Ruffing unfit for service. The Army decided that Ruffing could serve in a non-combat role. Ruffing missed the 1943 and 1944 seasons due to his service during World War II. He served in the Sixth Ferrying Group of the Air Transport Command of the United States Army Air Forces at the rank of private. However, he did pitch for the Air Transport Command&#x27;s baseball team, throwing a perfect game against Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s team, and leading his team to the championship against Ted Lyons&#x27; team. In 1944, he played with an All-Star team for troops stationed in Hawaii.

Ruffing turned 40 years of age during the war, resulting in his discharge in June 1945. He rejoined the Yankees that month, signing for the same $20,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms) he earned in 1942. He made his first appearance with the Yankees since the 1942 season in July 1945. Pitching for the Yankees as a spot starter in 1946, he had a 5–1 win–loss record and a 1.77 ERA when he suffered a broken kneecap from a line drive hit by Hank Majeski, and missed the remainder of the season.

In total, Ruffing won 231 games with the Yankees. This mark was the most in franchise history, until Ford surpassed it in 1965. He remains the winningest right-handed pitcher in Yankees&#x27; history.

====Chicago White Sox (1947)====
Suffering from recurrent knee injuries, the Yankees released Ruffing after the 1946 season. He signed with the Chicago White Sox for the 1947 season, but continued to be limited by his knee. In May, the White Sox removed Ruffing from their active roster after he was hit in his bad knee with another line drive. He rejoined the White Sox&#x27; active roster in July. He pitched to a 3–5 win–loss record and a 6.11 ERA in nine games pitched on the season. Ruffing retired after the 1947 season.

====Career summary====
Ruffing threw a fastball, a &quot;sharp&quot; curveball, and a slider. According to AL umpire Bill Summers, &quot;[O]n account of Red Ruffing, the slider got to be the thing.&quot; Joe Paparella, also an AL umpire, said &quot;The first game I ever worked behind the plate in the major leagues was against the guy who invented the slider and had the best slider ever seen — Red Ruffing&quot;.

Ruffing finished his career with 273 wins, 225 losses, 1,987 strikeouts and a 3.80 ERA. He also had 16 saves. Ruffing compiled 335 complete games in his 536 games started.

A combination of his extensive career workload, the offense-heavy era he pitched in, poor early ERAs prior to a mid-career change in his delivery, and the fact he pitched his entire 22-year career in a single league, Ruffing holds the AL record for most runs and earned runs allowed. This belies the fact that he finished in the Top 10 in the AL in ERA for eight consecutive years after mastering his new delivery, finishing 2nd twice and 3rd and 4th once each between 1932 and 1940. This two second-place finishes were to Hall of Famer Lefty Grove, who dominated the 1930s with seven league leads during the decade en route to his all-time AL record of nine. So high were ERAs during the 1932-1940 span that three times Grove was the only pitcher to better a 3.00 ERA, and once, in 1938, no AL pitcher did, Grove leading the league a 3.08.

Ruffing was an excellent hitter for a pitcher, good enough to frequently be called on to pinch hit and even play the outfield in emergency situations. His 36 home runs as a pitcher are fourth behind Ferrell, Warren Spahn, and Bob Lemon. He hit over .300 in eight different seasons, batting .269 overall with 521 hits in 1,937 career at-bats.

==Coaching career==
After he retired from pitching, Ruffing stayed with the White Sox organization to instruct their players. The White Sox named Ruffing the manager of their Class A minor league affiliate, the Muskegon Clippers of the Central League, for the 1949 season. That season, the Clippers finished in fifth place out of six teams. In 1950, Ruffing managed the Daytona Beach Islanders of the Florida State League, a Cleveland Indians&#x27; affiliate.

When Al Simmons retired from his coaching position with the Indians just before the 1951 season due to his failing health, bullpen coach Jake Flowers was moved to the third base coaching position, and Ruffing took over Flowers&#x27;s duties. From 1952 through 1961, Ruffing was a player personnel executive for the Indians. Ruffing returned to the baseball field serving as pitching coach for the expansion New York Mets in 1962, which were run by George Weiss, the general manager, and Casey Stengel, the manager. Weiss and Stengel had held the same positions with the Yankees during Ruffing&#x27;s tenure. As a team, the Mets had a 5.04 ERA across the 1962 season, which was the worst in the major leagues. The job also involved scouting duties, which Ruffing did not like, and he retired shortly after the season ended. He returned to baseball again for the 1969 season, at the request of former teammate Don Heffner, who was managing the Denver Bears of the American Association. Ruffing served as Heffner&#x27;s pitching coach.

==Personal life==

Ruffing married Pauline Mulholland, a native of Chicago, at the end of the 1934 season. The couple settled in Long Beach, California. When he worked for the Indians in the 1950s, the Ruffing family relocated to Cleveland. The couple had a son, named Charles Jr.

Ruffing suffered a stroke in 1974, at the age of 68, which left him paralyzed on his left side. As a result, he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life. This was Ruffing&#x27;s second stroke, and he also suffered from kidney and heart problems. He contracted skin cancer, necessitating the partial amputation of one of his ears. He died on February 17, 1986, at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, of heart failure.

==Honors==
In balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame following his retirement, Ruffing often received votes from approximately 50% of the voters in the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, short of the 75% required for induction. Bob Feller wrote an article in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1962, calling Ruffing, Satchel Paige, and Luke Appling the three most deserving players who had yet to be elected. The 1967 balloting was Ruffing&#x27;s final year of eligibility, as he had retired 20 years prior. Ruffing finished with 212 votes, tied with Joe Medwick for the highest vote count, but was still seven votes short of the 219 required for induction. However, a runoff election held the next month saw Ruffing elected to the Hall of Fame.

During an Old-Timers&#x27; Day ceremony held on July 10, 2004, at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees dedicated a plaque in Ruffing&#x27;s memory. The plaque is displayed in Monument Park. ESPN.com ranked Ruffing as the ninth greatest Yankee of all time.

A museum in Nokomis, Illinois, the Bottomley-Ruffing-Schalk Museum, is dedicated to Ruffing and fellow Hall of Famers Ray Schalk and Jim Bottomley.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Ruffing as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army Air Force during World War II.

<doc id="814709" wikidata="Q5437683" url="?curid=814709" title="Father of medicare">
<text>Several individuals have been described as the father of medicare in Canada. Medicare is the country&#x27;s publicly funded health system.

*Tommy Douglas championed public health insurance as Premier of Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1961 and federal leader of the New Democratic Party from 1961 to 1971.
*Woodrow Lloyd was the Premier of Saskatchewan when universal medicare was introduced in Saskatchewan.
*Lester B. Pearson was the Liberal Prime Minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968. His government saw medicare introduced on a national basis, after his party wrote and introduced the legislation for hospital and out-of-hospital treatment, and received the support of Douglas&#x27; NDP.
*Emmett Matthew Hall was a jurist and chair of the 1964 Royal Commission on health care in Canada which recommended the nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan&#x27;s system of public insurance for both hospitalization and out-of-hospital medical services. In 1996, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien stated that &quot;Canadians will be forever grateful for the pivotal role that [Hall] played in bringing universal medicare to Canada. Throughout his long life, he remained medicare&#x27;s most eloquent defender&quot;.
*Paul Martin Sr., Minister of National Health and Welfare from 1946 to 1957, played a central early role in the adoption of hospital insurance and is also remembered as a father of Medicare.

This list includes individuals from three major distinct and competing Canadian political traditions: Douglas and Lloyd from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, later the New Democratic Party; Hall, a Progressive Conservative; and Martin and Pearson, Liberals.

<text>Hydro Tasmania, known for most of its history as the Hydro-Electric Commission (HEC) or simply The Hydro, is the trading name of the Hydro-Electric Corporation, a Tasmanian Government business enterprise which is the main electricity generator in the state of Tasmania, Australia. The Hydro was originally oriented towards hydro-electricity, due to Tasmania&#x27;s dramatic topography and relatively high rainfall in the central and western parts of the state. Today, Hydro Tasmania operates thirty hydro-electric and one gas power station, and is a joint owner in three wind farms.

The Minister for Energy, currently the Hon. Nicholas Duigan MP, has portfolio responsibility for Hydro Tasmania. Hydro Tasmania operates under the &quot;Government Business Enterprises (GBE) Act&quot; 1995 and the &quot;Hydro-Electric Corporation Act&quot; 1995, and has a reporting requirement to the Treasurer of Tasmania, currently the Hon. Guy Barnett MP. Hydro Tasmania was projected to pay the Tasmanian Government a dividend of 122 million in 2024.

==History==

=== Establishment ===
In 1914, the State Government set up the Hydro-Electric Department (changed to the Hydro-Electric Commission in 1929) to complete the first HEC power station, the Waddamana Hydro-Electric Power Station. Prior to that two private hydro-electric stations had been opened the Launceston City Council&#x27;s Duck Reach Power Station, opened 1895 on the South Esk River (it was one of the first hydro-electric power stations in the southern hemisphere. Reefton Power Station in New Zealand is the first municipal hydro-station, beginning operations in 1888) and the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company&#x27;s Lake Margaret Power Station, opened in 1914. These power stations were taken over by the HEC and Duck Reach was closed in 1955. Lake Margaret was closed in 2006, but after a multimillion-dollar refit was recommissioned in 2009.

Following the Second World War in the 1940s and early 1950s, many migrants came to Tasmania to work for the HEC with construction of dams and substations. This was similar to the Snowy Mountains Scheme in New South Wales and similar effects in bringing in a significant number of people into the local community enriching the social fabric and culture of each state. Most constructions in this era were concentrated in the centre of the island.

As the choice of rivers and catchments in the central highlands were exhausted, the planners and engineers began serious surveying of the rivers of the west and south west regions of the state. The long term vision of those within the HEC and the politicians in support of the process, was for continued utilisation of all of the state&#x27;s water resources.

As a consequence of such a vision, the politicians and HEC bureaucrats were able to create the upper Gordon river power development schemes despite worldwide dismay at the loss of the original Lake Pedder. The hydro-industrialisation of Tasmania was seen as paramount above all, and the complaints from outsiders were treated with disdain.

=== Interrupted dam making ===
Following the flooding of Lake Pedder by the HEC for the upper Gordon Power Development and the subsequent backlash against the HEC incursions into the south west wilderness of Tasmania, environmental groups of the 1970s and 80s alerted the rest of Australia to the continued power that the HEC had over the Tasmanian environment and politics.

Numbers of Tasmanian politicians either rose or fell on their alignment with the support of the HEC and its power development schemes in the south west and West Coast of Tasmania.

When the HEC proposed a dam on the Gordon River, sited below the Franklin River, there was widespread and vigorous opposition. During the Franklin River &#x27;No Dams&#x27; campaign it was common for members of families to be in conflict with one another by being aligned with the HEC proposals or the Conservationists.

The Tasmanian Labor Government attempted to resolve the dispute by offering a compromise dam, sited on the Gordon River above the Olga River, which would have avoided flooding the Franklin River. However, almost no-one wanted this compromise. Conservationists were concerned that the Franklin River area and surrounding wilderness would be damaged, and those in favour of a dam preferred an option that would utilise the Franklin&#x27;s water as well as the Gordon&#x27;s water. 
The Tasmanian Government then offered a referendum on the issue, which only offered two choices: the Gordon below Franklin dam and the Gordon above Olga dam. There was widespread condemnation that the referendum did not offer a 3rd choice of not having any dam on the Gordon River, and various opinions were offered as to the best way of communicating this at the ballot box. As it turned out, of the 92% of eligible voters to attend the voting booths that day, 47% voted for the Gordon below Franklin option, with the remainder voting informally (45%) or for the Gordon above Olga option (8%). The conservationists were ultimately successful in their campaign to stop any dam on the Gordon River, and the proposal and early works on the Gordon-below-Franklin Dam ended in 1983 when it was blockaded by the environmentalists and the recently elected Liberal State Government lost a High Court challenge to the Commonwealth&#x27;s powers. The new Hawke Labor Government in Canberra had opposed the Franklin dam and had moved to stop its construction.

The compromise between the State and Federal government and conservationists led the HEC to see the end of an over fifty year long dam making enterprise in the construction of the Henty River and King River power developments.

=== The limits reached ===
The conservationists and the HEC in the 1980s acknowledged that there were a limited range of options for further power development schemes, and it was inevitable that the substantial workforce within the HEC specifically employed in the investigation and development of further dams would eventually become redundant.

Since the late 1990s HEC water storages have been progressively drawn down due to power demand exceeding long term supply, the overcoming of which was the original reason the Gordon-below-Franklin dam was proposed. The shortfall has been offset first by drawing down water storage and in latter years through increasing volumes of fossil fuel power generation, at first fuelled by oil and more recently by gas and, via the Basslink cable link to Victoria, coal.

=== From HEC to Hydro Tasmania ===
In the early 1990s, eastern state governments prepared for the National Electricity Market (NEM) and electricity deregulation. In anticipation of Tasmania joining NEM, the Hydro-Electric Commission was broken up on 1 July 1998, creating three separate state-owned companies:

* Hydro Tasmania, the electricity generator. 
* Transend Networks, the electricity transmitter. Transend has since merged with Aurora&#x27;s distribution arm to form TasNetworks.
* Aurora Energy, the electricity distributor and retailer, which sells and distributes electricity to customers.

Tasmania joined NEM in May 2005.

Starting from the 1990s, Hydro Tasmania has been investing in wind farms, the first one being the Huxley Hill Wind Farm on King Island, which was completed in 1998. This was followed by two wind farms at Woolnorth with a combined capacity of 140MW. Construction of a fourth power station, the Musselroe Wind Farm with a generating capacity of 168 MW was completed in 2013.

It was argued in support of the privatization of Hydro Tasmania that it would result in an increase in revenue and an improvement in company efficiency. The Liberals supported privatisation in the 1990s but failed to convince the public of its merits. They have now reversed this policy. The Labor Party and the Tasmanian Greens have never openly supported privatisation; however many speculate that the Labor Party will support this move in the future. Some evidence of this first arose in late 2003 when a Labor government allowed Hydro Tasmania to sell its subsidiary software business, Hydstra, to a German competitor and again in 2005 when it allowed the sale of part of its financial interests in wind farm company, Roaring 40s to a Hong Kong-based company CLP Power Asia. However, the present policy of all three major political parties is against privatisation, and community opinion mostly supports public ownership.

Hydro Tasmania in the 2000s saw the loss of the old dam building generation. The Anthony Power Development, was considered to be part of the last hydro-electric power development in Tasmania. In 2008, the &quot;1,000 GWH Project&quot; saw upgrades to parts of existing structures operated by the Hydro, and on-going progress towards being a carbon neutral operation. In 2020, Tasmania has an annual renewable electricity capacity of 10 TWh, equivalent to its average annual electricity consumption.

==2016 crisis==
In early 2016, as Tasmania was reaching the lowest water levels ever encountered, there was a fault in Basslink which led to the shutdown of the link to the mainland for about 6 months creating the 2016 power crisis. After Basslink came operational in 2006, the Bell Bay Power Station was decommissioned in 2009, resulting in a reduction of electricity generation capacity of , and leaving only Tamar Valley Power Station as a non-hydro power station. That plant had been mothballed and was to be sold when the crisis took place. The plant was recommissioned because of the crisis restoring a capacity of about and diesel generators were brought in from the mainland with a generating capacity of .

<doc id="814723" wikidata="Q170334" url="?curid=814723" title="Srebrenica massacre">
<text>The Srebrenica massacre, also known as the Srebrenica genocide, was the July 1995 genocidal killing of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys in and around the town of Srebrenica during the Bosnian War. It was mainly perpetrated by units of the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska under Ratko Mladić, though the Serb paramilitary unit Scorpions also participated. The massacre was the first legally recognised genocide in Europe since the end of World War II.

Before the massacre, the United Nations (UN) had declared the besieged enclave of Srebrenica a &quot;safe area&quot; under its protection. A UN Protection Force contingent of 370 lightly armed Dutch soldiers failed to deter the town&#x27;s capture and subsequent massacre. A list of people missing or killed during the massacre contains 8,372 names. , 6,838 genocide victims had been identified through DNA analysis of body parts recovered from mass graves; , 6,671 bodies had been buried at the Memorial Centre of Potočari, while another 236 had been buried elsewhere. Some Serbs have claimed the massacre was retaliation for civilian casualties inflicted on Bosnian Serbs by Bosniak soldiers from Srebrenica under the command of Naser Orić. These &#x27;revenge&#x27; claims have been rejected and condemned by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the UN.

In 2004, in a unanimous ruling on the case of &quot;Prosecutor v. Krstić&quot;, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY ruled the massacre of the enclave&#x27;s male inhabitants constituted genocide, a crime under international law. The ruling was also upheld by the International Court of Justice in 2007. The forcible transfer and abuse of between 25,000 and 30,000 Bosniak Muslim women, children and elderly, when accompanied by the massacre of the men, was found to constitute genocide. In 2002, the government of the Netherlands resigned, citing its inability to prevent the massacre. In 2013, 2014 and 2019, the Dutch state was found liable by its supreme court and the Hague district court, of failing to prevent more than 300 deaths. In 2013, Serbian president Tomislav Nikolić apologised for &quot;the crime&quot; of Srebrenica but refused to call it genocide.

In 2005, then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the massacre as &quot;a terrible crime – the worst on European soil since the Second World War&quot;, and in May 2024, the UN designated July 11 as the annual &quot;International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica&quot;.

== Background ==
=== Conflict in Eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
The Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was inhabited by mainly Muslim Bosniaks (44%), Orthodox Serbs (31%) and Catholic Croats (17%). As the former Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, the region declared national sovereignty in 1991 and held a referendum for independence in February 1992. The result, which favoured independence, was opposed by Bosnian Serb political representatives, who boycotted the referendum. The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formally recognised by the European Community in April 1992 and the UN in May 1992.

Following the declaration of independence, Bosnian Serb forces, supported by the Serbian government of Slobodan Milošević and the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA), attacked Bosnia and Herzegovina, to secure and unify the territory under Serb control, and create an ethnically homogenous Serb state of Republika Srpska. In the struggle for territorial control, the non-Serb populations from areas under Serbian control, especially the Bosniak population in East Bosnia, near the Serbian borders, were subject to ethnic cleansing.

=== Ethnic cleansing ===

Srebrenica, and the surrounding Central Podrinje region, had immense strategic importance to the Bosnian Serb leadership. It was the bridge to disconnected parts of the envisioned ethnic state of Republika Srpska. Capturing Srebrenica and eliminating its Muslim population would also undermine the viability of the Bosnian Muslim state.

In 1991, 73% of the population in Srebrenica were Bosnian Muslims and 25% Bosnian Serbs. Tension between Muslims and Serbs intensified in the early 1990s, as the local Serb population were provided with weapons and military equipment distributed by Serb paramilitary groups, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Jugoslovenska&quot; &quot;Narodna Armija&quot;, JNA) and the Serb Democratic Party (&quot;Srpska Demokratska Stranka&quot;, SDS).

By April 1992, Srebrenica had become isolated by Serb forces. On 17 April, the Bosnian Muslim population was given a 24-hour ultimatum to surrender all weapons and leave town. Srebrenica was briefly captured by the Bosnian Serbs and retaken by Bosnian Muslims on 8 May 1992. Nonetheless, the Bosnian Muslims remained surrounded by Serb forces, and cut off from outlying areas. The Naser Orić trial judgment described the situation:

Between April and June 1992 Bosnian Serb forces, with support from the JNA, destroyed 296 predominantly Bosniak villages around Srebrenica, forcibly uprooted 70,000 Bosniaks from their homes and systematically massacred at least 3,166 Bosniaks, including women, children and elderly. In neighbouring Bratunac, Bosniaks were either killed or forced to flee to Srebrenica, resulting in 1,156 deaths. Thousands of Bosniaks were killed in Foča, Zvornik, Cerska and Snagovo.

=== 1992–1993: Struggle for Srebrenica ===
Over the remainder of 1992, offensives by Bosnian government forces from Srebrenica increased the area under their control, and by January 1993 they had linked with Bosniak-held Žepa to the south and Cerska to the west. The Srebrenica enclave had reached its peak size of , though it was never linked to the main area of Bosnian-government controlled land in the west and remained &quot;a vulnerable island amid Serb-controlled territory&quot;. Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) forces under Naser Orić used Srebrenica as a staging ground to attack neighboring Serb villages inflicting many casualties. In 1993, the militarized Serb village of Kravica was attacked by ARBiH, which resulted in Serb civilian casualties. The resistance to the Serb siege of Srebrenica by the ARBiH, under Orić was seen as a catalyst for the massacre.

Serbs started persecuting Bosniaks in 1992. Serbian propaganda deemed Bosniak resistance to Serb attacks as a ground for revenge. According to French General Philippe Morillon, Commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), in testimony at the ICTY in 2004:
 
Over the next few months, the Serb military captured the villages of Konjević Polje and Cerska, severing the link between Srebrenica and Žepa, and reducing the Srebrenica enclave to 150 square kilometres. Bosniak residents of the outlying areas converged on Srebrenica and its population swelled to between 50,000 and 60,000, about ten times the pre-war population. General Morillon visited Srebrenica in March 1993. The town was overcrowded and siege conditions prevailed. There was almost no running water as the advancing Serb forces had destroyed water supplies; people relied on makeshift generators for electricity. Food, medicine and other essentials were scarce. The conditions rendered Srebrenica a slow death camp. Morillon told panicked residents at a public gathering that the town was under the protection of the UN, and he would never abandon them. During March and April 1993 several thousand Bosniaks were evacuated, under the auspices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The evacuations were opposed by the Bosnian government in Sarajevo, as contributing to the ethnic cleansing of predominantly Bosniak territory.

The Serb authorities remained intent on capturing the enclave. On 13 April 1993, the Serbs told the UNHCR representatives that they would attack the town within two days unless the Bosniaks surrendered and agreed to be evacuated.

====Starvation====
With the failure to demilitarize and the shortage of supplies getting in, Orić consolidated his power and controlled the black market. Orić&#x27;s men began hoarding food, fuel, cigarettes and embezzled money sent by aid agencies to support Muslim orphans. Basic necessities were out of reach for many in Srebrenica due to Orić&#x27;s actions. UN officials were beginning to lose patience with the ARBiH in Srebrenica and saw them as &quot;criminal gang leaders, pimps and black marketeers&quot;.

A former Serb soldier of the &quot;Red Berets&quot; unit described the tactics used to starve and kill the besieged population:

When British journalist Tony Birtley visited Srebrenica in March 1993, he took footage of civilians starving to death. The Hague Tribunal in the case of Orić concluded:

=== 1993–1995: Srebrenica &quot;safe area&quot; ===
==== UN Security Council declares Srebrenica a &quot;safe area&quot; ====
On 16 April 1993, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 819, which demanded &quot;all parties ... treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a safe area which should be free from any armed attack or ... hostile act&quot;. On 18 April, the first group of UNPROFOR troops arrived in Srebrenica. UNPROFOR deployed Canadian troops to protect it as one of five newly established UN &quot;safe areas&quot;. UNPROFOR&#x27;s presence prevented an all-out assault, though skirmishes and mortar attacks continued.

On 8 May 1993 agreement was reached for demilitarization of Srebrenica. According to a UN report, General [Sefer] Halilović and General Mladić agreed on measures covering the whole of the Srebrenica enclave and ... Žepa. ... Bosniac forces ... would hand over their weapons, ammunition and mines to UNPROFOR, after which Serb &#x27;heavy weapons and units that constitute a menace to the demilitarised zones ... will be withdrawn.&#x27; Unlike the earlier agreement, it stated specifically that Srebrenica was to be considered a &#x27;demilitarised zone&#x27;, as referred to in the ... Geneva Conventions. Both parties violated the agreement, though two years of relative stability followed the establishment of the enclave. Lieutenant colonel Thom Karremans (the Dutchbat Commander) testified that his personnel were prevented from returning to the enclave by Serb forces, and that equipment and ammunition were prevented from getting in. Bosniaks in Srebrenica complained of attacks by Serb soldiers, while to the Serbs it appeared Bosnian forces were using the &quot;safe area&quot;, as a convenient base to launch counter-offensives and UNPROFOR was failing to prevent it. General Sefer Halilović admitted ARBiH helicopters had flown in violation of the no-fly zone and he had dispatched eight helicopters with ammunition for the 28th Division.

Between 1,000 and 2,000 soldiers from the VRS Drina Corps Brigades were deployed around the enclave, equipped with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and mortars. The 28th Mountain Division of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) in the enclave was neither well organised nor equipped, and lacked a firm command structure and communications system. Some of its soldiers carried old hunting rifles or no weapons, few had proper uniforms.

==== UN failure to demilitarise ====
A Security Council mission led by Diego Arria arrived on 25 April 1993 and, in their report to the UN, condemned the Serbs for perpetrating &quot;a slow-motion process of genocide&quot;. The mission stated &quot;Serb forces must withdraw to points from which they cannot attack, harass or terrorise the town.&quot; Specific instructions from UN Headquarters in New York stated UNPROFOR should not be too zealous in searching for Bosniak weapons and the Serbs should withdraw their heavy weapons before the Bosniaks disarmed, which the Serbs never did.

Attempts to demilitarise the ARBiH and force withdrawal of the VRS proved futile. The ARBiH hid most of their heavy weapons, modern equipment and ammunition in the surrounding forest and only handed over disused and old weaponry. The VRS refused to withdraw from the front lines due to intelligence they received regarding ARBiH&#x27;s hidden weaponry.

In March 1994, UNPROFOR sent 600 Dutch soldiers (&quot;Dutchbat&quot;) to replace the Canadians. By March 1995, Serb forces controlled all territory surrounding Srebrenica, preventing even UN access to the supply road. Humanitarian aid decreased and living conditions quickly deteriorated. UNPROFOR presence prevented all-out assault on the safe area, though skirmishes and mortar attacks continued. The Dutchbat alerted UNPROFOR command to the dire conditions, but UNPROFOR declined to send humanitarian relief or military support.

====Organisation of UNPROFOR and UNPF====
In April 1995, UNPROFOR became the name used for the Bosnia and Herzegovina regional command of the now-renamed United Nations Peace Forces (UNPF), with &quot;12,500 British, French and Dutch troops equipped with tanks and high calibre artillery to increase the effectiveness and the credibility of the peacekeeping operation&quot;. The report states:

==== Situation deteriorates ====
By early 1995, fewer and fewer supply convoys were making it through to the enclave. The situation in Srebrenica and other enclaves had deteriorated into lawless violence as prostitution among young Muslim girls, theft and black marketeering proliferated. Already meager resources dwindled further, and even the UN forces started running dangerously low on food, medicine, ammunition and fuel, eventually being forced to start patrolling on foot. Dutch soldiers who left on leave were not allowed to return, and their number dropped from 600 to 400 men. In March and April, the Dutch soldiers noticed a build-up of Serb forces.

In March 1995, Radovan Karadžić, President of the Republika Srpska (RS), despite pressure from the international community to end the war and efforts to negotiate peace, issued a directive to the VRS concerning long-term strategy in the enclave. The directive, known as &quot;Directive 7&quot;, specified the VRS was to:

By mid-1995, the humanitarian situation in the enclave was catastrophic. In May, following orders, Orić and his staff left the enclave, leaving senior officers in command of the 28th Division. In late June and early July, the 28th Division issued reports including urgent pleas for the humanitarian corridor to be reopened. When this failed, Bosniak civilians began dying from starvation. On 7 July the mayor reported eight residents had died. On 4 June, UNPROFOR commander Bernard Janvier, a Frenchman, secretly met with Mladić to obtain the release of hostages, many of whom were French. Mladić demanded of Janvier that there would be no more airstrikes.

In the weeks leading up to the assault on Srebrenica by the VRS, ARBiH forces were ordered to carry out diversion and disruption attacks on the VRS by the high command. On one occasion on 25 June, ARBiH forces attacked VRS units on the Sarajevo–Zvornik road, inflicting high casualties and looting VRS stockpiles.

==== 6–11 July 1995: Serb takeover ====
The Serb offensive against Srebrenica began in earnest on 6 July. The VRS, with 2,000 soldiers, were outnumbered by the defenders and did not expect the assault to be an easy victory. Five UNPROFOR observation posts in the south of the enclave fell in the face of the Bosnian Serb advance. Some Dutch soldiers retreated into the enclave after their posts were attacked, the crews of the other observation posts surrendered into Serb custody. The defending Bosnian forces numbering 6,000 came under fire and were pushed back towards the town. Once the southern perimeter began to collapse, about 4,000 Bosniak residents, who had been living in a Swedish housing complex for refugees nearby, fled north into Srebrenica. Dutch soldiers reported the advancing Serbs were &quot;cleansing&quot; the houses in the south of the enclave.

On 8 July, a Dutch YPR-765 armoured vehicle took fire from the Serbs and withdrew. A group of Bosniaks demanded the vehicle stay to defend them, and established a makeshift barricade to prevent its retreat. As the vehicle withdrew, a Bosniak farmer manning the barricade threw a grenade onto it and killed Dutch soldier Raviv van Renssen. On 9 July, emboldened by success, little resistance from the demilitarised Bosniaks and lack of reaction from the international community, President Karadžić issued a new order authorising the 1,500-strong VRS Drina Corps to capture Srebrenica.

The following morning, 10 July, Lieutenant Colonel Karremans made urgent requests for air support from NATO to defend Srebrenica as crowds filled the streets, some of whom carried weapons. VRS tanks were approaching, and NATO airstrikes on these began on 11 July. NATO bombers attempted to attack VRS artillery locations outside the town, but poor visibility forced NATO to cancel this. Further air attacks were cancelled after VRS threats to bomb the UN&#x27;s Potočari compound, kill Dutch and French military hostages and attack surrounding locations where 20,000 to 30,000 civilian refugees were situated. 30 Dutchbat were taken hostage by Mladic&#x27;s troops.

Late in the afternoon of 11 July, General Mladić, accompanied by General Živanović (Commander of the Drina Corps), General Krstić (Deputy Commander of the Drina Corps) and other VRS officers, took a triumphant walk through the deserted streets of Srebrenica. In the evening, Lieutenant Colonel Karremans was filmed drinking a toast with Mladić during the bungled negotiations on the fate of the civilian population grouped in Potočari.

== Massacre ==
The two highest-ranking Serb politicians from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Karadžić and Momčilo Krajišnik, both indicted for genocide, were warned by VRS commander Mladić (found guilty of genocide in 2017) that their plans could not be realized without committing genocide. Mladić said at a parliamentary session of 12 May 1992:

=== Increasing concentration of refugees in Potočari ===
By the evening of 11 July, approximately 20,000–25,000 Bosniak refugees from Srebrenica were gathered in Potočari, seeking protection within the UNPROFOR Dutchbat headquarters. Several thousand had pressed inside the compound, while the rest were spread throughout neighbouring factories and fields. Though most were women, children, elderly or disabled, 63 witnesses estimated there were at least 300 men inside the compound and between 600 and 900 in the crowd outside.

Conditions included &quot;little food or water&quot; and sweltering heat. A UNPROFOR Dutchbat officer described the scene:

On 12 July, the UN Security Council, in Resolution 1004, expressed concern at the humanitarian situation in Potočari, condemned the offensive by Bosnian Serb forces and demanded immediate withdrawal. On 13 July, the Dutch forces expelled 5 Bosniak refugees from the compound despite knowing men outside were being killed.

=== Crimes committed in Potočari ===
On 12 July the refugees in the compound could see VRS members setting houses and haystacks on fire. Throughout the afternoon, Serb soldiers mingled in the crowd and summary executions of men occurred. In the morning of 12 July, a witness saw a pile of 20–30 bodies heaped up behind the Transport Building, alongside a tractor-like machine. Another testified he saw a soldier slay a child with a knife, in the middle of a crowd of expellees. He said he saw Serb soldiers execute more than a hundred Bosniak Muslim men behind the Zinc Factory, then load their bodies onto a truck, though the number and nature of the murders contrasted with other evidence in the Trial Record, which indicated killings in Potočari were sporadic in nature. Soldiers were picking people out of the crowd and taking them away. A witness recounted how three brothers – one merely a child, the others in their teens – were taken out in the night. When the boys&#x27; mother went looking for them, she found them stark naked and with their throats slit.

That night, a Dutchbat medical orderly witnessed two Serb soldiers raping a woman. A survivor, Zarfa Turković, described the horrors: &quot;Two [Serb soldiers] took her legs and raised them in the air, while the third began raping her. Four of them were taking turns on her. People were silent, and no one moved. She was screaming and yelling and begging them to stop. They put a rag into her mouth, and then we just heard silent sobs.&quot;

==== Murder of Bosniak men and boys in Potočari ====
From the morning of July 12, Serb forces began gathering men and boys from the refugee population in Potočari and holding them in separate locations, and as the refugees began boarding the buses headed north towards Bosniak-held territory, Serb soldiers separated men of military age who were trying to clamber aboard. Occasionally, younger and older men were stopped as well (some as young as 14). These men were taken to a building referred to as the &quot;White House&quot;. By the evening of 12 July, Major Franken of Dutchbat heard that no men were arriving with the women and children, at their destination in Kladanj. The UNHCR Director of Operations, Peter Walsh, was dispatched to Srebrenica by Chief of Mission, Damaso Feci, to evaluate what emergency aid could be provided rapidly. Walsh and his team arrived at Gostilj, just outside Srebrenica, in the afternoon only to be turned away by VRS forces. Despite claiming freedom of movement rights, the UNHCR team was not allowed to proceed and forced to head back north to Bijelina. Throughout, Walsh relayed reports back to UNHCR in Zagreb about the unfolding situation, including witnessing the enforced movement and abuse of Muslim men and boys, and the sound of executions taking place.

On July 13, Dutchbat troops witnessed definite signs Serb soldiers were murdering Bosniak men who had been separated. Corporal Vaasen saw two soldiers take a man behind the &quot;White House&quot;, heard a shot and saw the two soldiers reappear alone. Another Dutchbat officer saw Serb soldiers murder an unarmed man with a gunshot to the head, and heard gunshots 20–40 times an hour throughout the afternoon. When the Dutchbat soldiers told Colonel Joseph Kingori, a United Nations Military Observer (UNMO) in the Srebrenica area, that men were being taken behind the &quot;White House&quot; and not coming back, Kingori went to investigate. He heard gunshots as he approached, but was stopped by Serb soldiers before he could find out what was going on.

Some executions were carried out at night under arc lights, and bulldozers then pushed the bodies into mass graves. According to evidence collected from Bosniaks by French policeman Jean-René Ruez, some were buried alive; he heard testimony describing Serb forces killing and torturing refugees, streets littered with corpses, people committing suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, and adults being forced to watch soldiers kill their children.

==== Rape and abuse of civilians ====
Thousands of women and girls suffered rape and sexual abuse and other forms of torture. According to the testimony of Zumra Šehomerovic:

Testimony of Ramiza Gurdić:

Testimony of Kada Hotić:

That night, a Dutchbat medical orderly came across two Serb soldiers raping a young woman:

==== Deportation of women ====
As a result of exhaustive UN negotiations with Serb troops, around 25,000 Srebrenica women were forcibly transferred to Bosniak-controlled territory. Some buses apparently never reached safety. According to a witness account by Kadir Habibović, who hid himself on one of the first buses from the base in Potočari to Kladanj, he saw at least one vehicle full of Bosniak women being driven away from Bosnian government-held territory.

=== Column of Bosniak men ===
On the evening of 11 July, word spread that able-bodied men should take to the woods, form a column with the ARBiH&#x27;s 28th Division and attempt a breakthrough towards Bosnian government-held territory in the north. They believed they stood a better chance of surviving by trying to escape, than if they fell into Serb hands. Around 10 pm on 11 July the Division command, with the municipal authorities, took the decision to form a column and attempt to reach government territory around Tuzla.
Dehydration, along with lack of sleep and exhaustion were further problems; there was little cohesion or common purpose. Along the way, the column was shelled and ambushed. In severe mental distress, some refugees killed themselves. Others were induced to surrender. Survivors claimed they were attacked with a chemical agent that caused hallucinations, disorientation and strange behaviour. Infiltrators in civilian clothing confused, attacked and killed refugees. Many taken prisoner were killed on the spot. Others were collected and taken to remote locations, for execution.

The attacks broke the column into smaller segments. Only about one third succeeded in crossing the asphalt road between Konjević Polje and Nova Kasaba. This group reached Bosnian government territory on and after 16 July. A second, smaller group (700–800) attempted to escape into Serbia. It is not known how many were intercepted and killed. A third group headed for Žepa; estimates of how many vary between 300 and 850. Pockets of resistance apparently remained behind and engaged Serb forces.

==== Tuzla column departs ====
Almost all the 28th Division, 5,500 to 6,000 soldiers, not all armed, gathered in Šušnjari, in the hills north of Srebrenica, along with about 7,000 civilians. They included a few women. Others assembled in the nearby village of Jaglići.

Around midnight, the column started moving along the axis between Konjević Polje and Bratunac. It was preceded by four scouts, 5 km ahead. Members walked one behind the other, following the paper trail laid by a demining unit.

The column was led by 50–100 of the best soldiers from each brigade, carrying the best equipment. Elements of the 284th Brigade were followed by the 280th Brigade. Civilians accompanied by other soldiers followed, and at the back was the independent battalion. The command and armed men were at the front, following the deminer unit. Others included political leaders of the enclave, medical staff and families of prominent Srebrenicans. A few women, children and elderly travelled with the column in the woods. The column was 12-15km long, two and a half hours separating head from tail.

The attempt to reach Tuzla surprised the VRS and caused confusion, as the VRS had expected the men to go to Potočari. Serb general Milan Gvero, in a briefing, referred to the column as &quot;hardened and violent criminals who will stop at nothing to prevent being taken prisoner&quot;. The Drina The VRS Main Staff ordered all available manpower to find any Muslim groups observed, prevent them crossing into Muslim territory, take them prisoner and hold them in buildings that could be secured by small forces.

==== Ambush at Kamenica Hill ====
During the night, poor visibility, fear of mines and panic induced by artillery fire split the column in two. On the afternoon of 12 July, the front section emerged from the woods and crossed the asphalt road from Konjević Polje and Nova Kasaba. Around 6pm, the VRS Army located the main part of the column around Kamenica. Around 8pm this part, led by the municipal authorities and wounded, started descending Kamenica Hill towards the road. After about 40 men had crossed, soldiers of the VRS arrived from the direction of Kravica in trucks and armoured vehicles, including a white vehicle with UNPROFOR symbols, calling over the loudspeaker, to surrender.

Yellow smoke was observed, followed by strange behaviour, including suicides, hallucinations and column members attacking one another. Survivors claimed they were attacked with a chemical agent that caused hallucinations and disorientation. General Tolimir was an advocate of the use of chemical weapons against the ArBiH. Shooting and shelling began, which continued into the night. Armed members of the column returned fire and all scattered. Survivors at least 1,000 engaged at close range by small arms. Hundreds appear to have been killed as they fled the open area and some were said to have killed themselves to escape capture.

VRS and Ministry of Interior personnel persuaded column members to surrender, by promising them safe transportation towards Tuzla, under UNPROFOR and Red Cross supervision. Appropriated UN and Red Cross equipment was used to deceive them. Belongings were confiscated and some executed on the spot.

The rear of the column lost contact and panic broke out. Many remained in the Kamenica Hill area for days, with the escape route blocked by Serb forces. Thousands of Bosniaks surrendered or were captured. Some were ordered to summon friends and family from the woods. There were reports of Serb forces using megaphones to call on the marchers to surrender, telling them they would be exchanged for Serb soldiers. It was at Kamenica that VRS personnel in civilian dress were reported to have infiltrated the column. Men who survived described it as a manhunt.

==== Sandići massacre ====
Close to Sandići, on the main road from Bratunac to Konjević Polje, a witness described the Serbs forcing a Bosniak man to call other Bosniaks down from the mountains. 200–300 men, including the witness&#x27; brother, descended to meet the VRS, presumably expecting an exchange of prisoners. The witness hid behind a tree and watched as the men were lined up in seven ranks, each 40 m long, with hands behind their heads; they were then mowed down by machine guns.

Some women, children and elderly people who had been part of the column, were allowed to join buses evacuating women and children from Potočari.

==== Trek to Mount Udrč ====
The central section of the column managed to escape the shooting, reached Kamenica around 11am and waited for the wounded. Captain Golić and the Independent Battalion turned back towards Hajdučko Groblje, to help the casualties. Survivors from the rear, crossed the asphalt roads to the north or the west, and joined the central section. The front third of the column, which had left Kamenica Hill by the time the ambush occurred, headed for Mount Udrč (); crossing the main asphalt road. They reached the base of the mountain on Thursday 13 July and regrouped. At first, it was decided to send 300 ARBiH soldiers back to break through the blockades. When reports came that the central section had crossed the road at Konjević Polje, this plan was abandoned. Approximately 1,000 additional men managed to reach Udrč that night.

==== Snagovo ambush ====
From Udrč, the marchers moved toward the River Drinjača and Mount Velja Glava. Finding Serbs at Mount Velja Glava, on Friday, 14 July, the column skirted the mountain and waited on its slopes, before moving toward Liplje and Marčići. Arriving at Marčići in the evening of 14 July, they were ambushed again near Snagovo by forces equipped with anti-aircraft guns, artillery, and tanks. The column broke through and captured a VRS officer, providing them with a bargaining counter. This prompted an attempt at negotiating a ceasefire, but this failed.

==== Approaching the frontline ====
The evening of 15 July saw the first radio contact between the 2nd Corps and the 28th Division. The Šabić brothers were able to identify each other as they stood on either side of the VRS lines. Early in the morning, the column crossed the road linking Zvornik with Caparde and headed towards Planinci, leaving 100–200 armed marchers behind to wait for stragglers. The column reached Križevići later that day, and remained while an attempt was made to negotiate with Serb forces, for safe passage. They were advised to stay where they were, and allow Serb forces to arrange safe passage. It became apparent, that the small Serb force was only trying to gain time to organise another attack. In the area of Marčići – Crni Vrh, VRS armed forces deployed 500 soldiers and policemen to stop the split part of the column, about 2,500 people, which was moving from Glodi towards Marčići. The column&#x27;s leaders decided to form small groups of 100–200 and send these to reconnoitre ahead. The 2nd Corps and 28th Division of the ARBiH met each other in Potočani.

==== Breakthrough at Baljkovica ====
The hillside at Baljkovica () formed the last VRS line separating the column from Bosnian-held territory. The VRS cordon consisted of two lines, the first of which presented a front on the Tuzla side, against the 2nd Corps and the other a front against the approaching 28th Division.

On the evening of 15 July a hailstorm caused Serb forces to take cover. The column&#x27;s advance group took advantage to attack the Serb rear lines at Baljkovica. The main body of what remained of the column began to move from Krizevici. It reached the area of fighting around 3 am on Sunday, 16 July. At approximately 5am, the 2nd Corps made its first attempt to break through the VRS cordon. The objective was to breakthrough close to the hamlets of Parlog and Resnik. They were joined by Orić and some of his men. Around 8 am, parts of the 28th Division, with the 2nd Corps of the RBiH Army from Tuzla providing artillery support, attacked and breached VRS lines. There was fierce fighting across Baljkovica. The column finally succeeded in breaking through to Bosnian government-controlled territory, between 1 and 2 pm.

==== Baljkovica corridor ====
Following radio negotiations between the 2nd Corps and Zvornik Brigade, Brigade Command agreed to open a corridor to allow &quot;evacuation&quot; of the column in return for the release of captured policemen and soldiers. The corridor was open 2–5pm. After the corridor was closed between 5 and 6 pm, the Zvornik Brigade Command reported that around 5000 civilians, with probably &quot;a certain number of soldiers&quot; with them had been let through, but &quot;all those who passed were unarmed&quot;.
By about 4 August, the ArBiH determined that 3,175 members of the 28th Division had managed to get through to Tuzla. 2,628 members of the Division, soldiers and officers, were considered certain to have been killed. Column members killed was between 8,300 and 9,722.

==== After closure of the corridor ====
Once the corridor had closed, Serb forces recommenced hunting down parts of the column. Around 2,000 refugees were reported to be hiding in the woods in the area of Pobuđe. On 17 July, four children aged between 8 and 14 captured by the Bratunac Brigade were taken to the military barracks in Bratunac. Brigade Commander Blagojević suggested the Drina Corps&#x27; press unit record this testimony on video.

On 18 July, after a soldier was killed &quot;trying to capture some persons during the search operation&quot;, the Zvornik Brigade Command issued an order to execute prisoners, to avoid any risks associated with their capture. The order was presumed to have remained effective until countermanded on 21 July.

====Impact on survivors====
According to a 1998 qualitative study involving survivors, many column members exhibited symptoms of hallucinations to varying degrees. Several times, Bosniak men attacked one another, in fear the other was a Serb soldier. Survivors reported seeing people speaking incoherently, running towards VRS lines in a rage and committing suicide using firearms and hand grenades. Although there was no evidence to suggest what exactly caused the behaviour, the study suggested fatigue and stress may have induced this.

=== A plan to execute the men ===
Although Serb forces had long been blamed for the massacre, it was not until 2004—following the Srebrenica Commission&#x27;s report—that Serb officials acknowledged their forces carried out the mass killing. Their report acknowledged the mass murder of the men and boys was planned, and more than 7,800 were killed.

A concerted effort was made to capture all Bosniak men of military age. In fact, those captured included many boys well below that age, and men years above that age, who remained in the enclave following the take-over of Srebrenica. These men and boys were targeted, regardless of whether they chose to flee to Potočari or join the column. The operation to capture and detain the men was well-organised and comprehensive. The buses which transported women and children, were systematically searched for men.

=== Mass executions ===
The amount of planning and high-level coordination invested in killing thousands in a few days, is apparent from the scale and methodical nature in which the executions were carried out.

The Army of Republika Srpska took the largest number of prisoners on 13 July, along the Bratunac-Konjević Polje road. Witnesses describe the assembly points, such as the field at Sandići, agricultural warehouses in Kravica, the school in Konjević Polje, the football pitch in Nova Kasaba, Lolići and Luke school. Several thousand people were herded in the field near Sandići and on the Nova Kasaba pitch, where they were searched and put into smaller groups. In a video by journalist Zoran Petrović, a Serb soldier states that at least 3,000–4,000 men gave themselves up on the road. By the late afternoon of 13 July, the total had risen to 6,000 according to intercepted radio communication; the following day, Major Franken of Dutchbat was given the same figure by Colonel Radislav Janković of the Serb army. Many prisoners had been seen in the locations described, by passing convoys taking women and children to Kladanj by bus, while aerial photos provided evidence to confirm this.

One hour after the evacuation of women from Potočari was complete, the Drina Corps staff diverted the buses to the areas in which the men were being held. Colonel Krsmanović, who on 12 July had arranged the buses for the evacuation, ordered the 700 men in Sandići to be collected, and the soldiers guarding them, made them throw their possessions on a heap and hand over valuables. During the afternoon, the group in Sandići was visited by Mladić who told them they would come to no harm, be treated as prisoners of war, exchanged for other prisoners and their families had been escorted to Tuzla in safety. Some men were placed on transports to Bratunac and other locations, while some were marched to warehouses in Kravica. The men gathered on the pitch at Nova Kasaba were forced to hand over belongings. They too received a visit from Mladić during the afternoon of 13 July; on this occasion, he announced that the Bosnian authorities in Tuzla did not want them and so they were to be taken elsewhere. The men in Nova Kasaba were loaded onto buses and trucks and taken to Bratunac, or other locations.

The Bosnian men who had been separated from the women, children and elderly in Potočari, numbering approximately 1,000, were transported to Bratunac and joined by Bosnian men captured from the column. Almost without exception, the thousands of prisoners captured after the take-over were executed. Some were killed individually, or in small groups, by the soldiers who captured them. Most were killed in carefully orchestrated mass executions, commencing on 13 July, just north of Srebrenica.

The mass executions followed a well-established pattern. The men were taken to empty schools or warehouses. After being detained for hours, they were loaded onto buses or trucks and taken to another site, usually in an isolated location. They were unarmed and often steps were taken to minimise resistance, such as blindfolding, binding their wrists behind their backs with ligatures, or removing their shoes. Once at the killing fields, the men were taken off the trucks in small groups, lined up and shot. Those who survived the initial shooting were shot with an extra round, though sometimes only after they had been left to suffer.

==== Morning of 13 July: Jadar River ====
Prior to midday on 13 July, seventeen men were transported by bus a short distance to a spot on the banks of the Jadar River where they were lined up and shot. One man, after being hit in the hip by a bullet, jumped into the river and managed to escape.

==== Early afternoon of 13 July: Cerska Valley ====

The first mass executions began on 13 July in the valley of the River Cerska, to the west of Konjević Polje. One witness, hidden among trees, saw two or three trucks, followed by an armoured vehicle and earthmoving machine proceeding towards Cerska. He heard gunshots for half an hour and then saw the armoured vehicle going in the opposite direction, but not the earthmoving machine. Other witnesses report seeing a pool of blood alongside the road to Cerska. Muhamed Duraković, a UN translator, probably passed this execution site later that day. He reports seeing bodies tossed into a ditch alongside the road, with some men still alive.

Aerial photos, and excavations, confirmed the presence of a mass grave near this location. Bullet cartridges, found at the scene, showed that the victims were first lined up on one side of the road, whereupon their executioners shot from the other. The 150 bodies were covered with earth where they lay. It was later established they had been killed by gunfire. All were men, aged 14–50, and all but three was wearing civilian clothes. Many had their hands tied behind their backs. Nine were later identified on the Srebrenica missing persons list.

==== Late afternoon of 13 July: Kravica ====
Later on 13 July executions were conducted in the largest of four farm sheds, owned by the Agricultural Cooperative in Kravica. Between 1,000 and 1,500 men had been captured in fields near Sandići and detained in Sandići Meadow. They were brought to Kravica, either by bus or on foot, the distance being approximately 1km. A witness recalls seeing around 200 men, stripped to the waist and with their hands in the air, being forced to run in the direction of Kravica. An aerial photo taken at 2pm shows two buses standing in front of the sheds.

At around 6pm, when the men were all held in the warehouse, VRS soldiers threw in hand grenades and fired weapons, including rocket propelled grenades. This mass murder seemed &quot;well organised and involved a substantial amount of planning, requiring the participation of the Drina Corps Command&quot;.

Supposedly, there was more killing in and around Kravica and Sandići. Even before the murders in the warehouse, some 200 or 300 men were formed up in ranks near Sandići, then executed en masse with concentrated machine gun fire. At Kravica, it was claimed some local men assisted the killings. Some victims were mutilated and killed with knives. The bodies were taken to Bratunac, or simply dumped in the river that runs alongside the road. One witness stated this all took place on 14 July. There were three survivors of the mass murder in the farm sheds at Kravica.

Armed guards shot at the men who tried to climb out the windows to escape the massacre. When the shooting stopped, the shed was full of bodies. Another survivor, who was only slightly wounded, reports:

When this witness climbed out of a window, he was seen by a guard who shot at him. He pretended to be dead and managed to escape the following morning. The other witness quoted above spent the night under a heap of bodies; the next morning, he watched as the soldiers examined the corpses for signs of life. The few survivors were forced to sing Serbian songs and were then shot. Once the final victim had been killed, an excavator was driven in to shunt the bodies out of the shed; the asphalt outside was then hosed down with water. In September 1996, however, it was still possible to find the evidence.

Analyses of hair, blood and explosives residue collected at the Kravica Warehouse provide strong evidence of the killings. Experts determined the presence of bullet strikes, explosives residue, bullets and shell cases, as well as human blood, bones and tissue adhering to the walls and floors of the building. Forensic evidence presented by the ICTY Prosecutor established a link between the executions in Kravica and the &#x27;primary&#x27; mass grave known as Glogova 2, in which the remains of 139 people were found. In the &#x27;secondary&#x27; grave known as Zeleni Jadar 5, there were 145 bodies, several were charred. Pieces of brick and window frame found in the Glogova 1 grave that was opened later, also established a link with Kravica. Here, the remains of 191 victims were found.

==== 13–14 July: Tišća ====

As the buses crowded with Bosnian women, children and elderly made their way from Potočari to Kladanj, they were stopped at Tišća village, searched, and the Bosnian men and boys found on board were removed. The evidence reveals a well-organised operation in Tišća.

From the checkpoint, an officer directed the soldier escorting the witness towards a nearby school where many other prisoners were being held. At the school, a soldier on a field telephone appeared to be transmitting and receiving orders. Around midnight, the witness was loaded onto a truck with 22 other men with their hands tied behind their backs. At one point the truck stopped and a soldier said: &quot;Not here. Take them up there, where they took people before.&quot; The truck reached another stopping point and the soldiers came to the back of the truck and started shooting the prisoners. The survivor escaped by running away from the truck and hiding in a forest.

==== 14 July: Grbavci and Orahovac ====
A large group of prisoners held overnight in Bratunac were bussed in a convoy of 30 vehicles to the Grbavci school in Orahovica, early on 14 July. When they arrived, the gym was already half-full with prisoners and within a few hours, the building was full. Survivors estimated there were about 2,000 men, some very young, others elderly, although the ICTY Prosecution suggested this maybe an overestimation, with the number closer to 1,000. Some prisoners were taken outside and killed. At some point, a witness recalled, General Mladić arrived and told the men: &quot;Well, your government does not want you and I have to take care of you.&quot;

After being held in the gym for hours, the men were led out in small groups to the execution fields that afternoon. Each prisoner was blindfolded and given water as he left. The prisoners were taken in trucks to the fields less than 1km away. The men were lined up and shot in the back; those who survived were killed with an extra shot. Two adjacent meadows were used; once one was full of bodies, the executioners moved to the other. While the executions were in progress, the survivors said earth-moving equipment dug the graves. A witness reported that Mladić watched some of the executions.

The forensic evidence supports crucial aspects of the testimony. Aerial photos show the ground in Orahovac was disturbed between 5 and 27 July and between 7 and 27 September. Two primary mass graves were uncovered in the area and named Lazete 1 and Lazete 2 by investigators. Lazete 1 was exhumed by the ICTY in 2000. All of the 130 individuals uncovered, for whom sex could be determined, were male; 138 blindfolds were found. Identification material for 23 persons, listed as missing following the fall of Srebrenica, was located during the exhumations. Lazete 2 was partly exhumed by a joint team, from the Office of the Prosecutor and Physicians for Human Rights, in 1996 and completed in 2000. All of the 243 victims associated with Lazete 2 were male, and experts determined most died of gunshot injuries. 147 blindfolds were located. Forensic analysis of soil/pollen samples, blindfolds, ligatures, shell cases and aerial images of creation/disturbance dates, further revealed that bodies, from Lazete 1 and 2, were reburied at secondary graves named Hodžići Road 3, 4 and 5. Aerial images show these secondary gravesites were begun in early September 1995 and all were exhumed in 1998.

==== 14–15 July: Petkovići ====

On 14 and 15 July 1995, another group of prisoners numbering 1,500 to 2,000 were taken from Bratunac to the school in Petkovići. The conditions at the Petkovići school were even worse than Grbavci. It was hot, and overcrowded and there was no food or water. In the absence of anything else, some prisoners chose to drink their urine. Now and then, soldiers would enter the room and physically abuse prisoners or call them outside. A few contemplated an escape attempt, but others said it would be better to stay since the International Red Cross would be sure to monitor the situation and they could not all be killed.

The men were called outside in small groups. They were ordered to strip to the waist and remove their shoes, whereupon their hands were tied behind their backs. During the night of 14 July, the men were taken by truck to the dam at Petkovići. Those who arrived later could see immediately what was happening. Bodies were strewn on the ground, hands tied behind their backs. Small groups of five to ten men were taken out of the trucks, lined up and shot. Some begged for water but their pleas were ignored. A survivor described his feelings of fear combined with thirst:

After the soldiers had left, two survivors helped each other to untie their hands and crawled over the bodies towards the woods, where they intended to hide. As dawn arrived, they could see the execution site where bulldozers were collecting the bodies. On the way to the execution site, one survivor peeked out from under his blindfold and saw Mladić on his way to the scene.

Aerial photos confirmed the earth near the Petkovići dam had been disturbed and it was disturbed again in late September 1995. When the grave was opened in April 1998, there seemed to be many bodies missing. Their removal had been accomplished with mechanical apparatus, causing considerable disturbance. The grave contained the remains of no more than 43 persons. Other bodies had been removed to a secondary grave, Liplje 2, before 2 October. Here, the remains of at least 191 individuals were discovered.

==== 14–16 July: Branjevo ====
On 14 July, more prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to a school in Pilica. As at other detention facilities, there was no food or water and several died from heat and dehydration. The men were held at the school for two nights. On 16 July, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs, driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot.

Dražen Erdemović—who confessed to killing at least 70 Bosniaks—was a member of the VRS 10th Sabotage Detachment. Erdemović appeared as a prosecution witness and testified: &quot;The men in front of us were ordered to turn their backs ... we shot at them. We were given orders to shoot.&quot; On this point, a survivor recalls:

Erdemović said nearly all the victims wore civilian clothes and, except for one person who tried to escape, offered no resistance. Sometimes the executioners were particularly cruel. When some soldiers recognised acquaintances, they beat and humiliated them, before killing them. Erdemović had to persuade fellow soldiers to stop using machine guns; while it mortally wounded the prisoners, it did not cause death immediately and prolonged their suffering.
Between 1,000 and 1,200 men were killed in that day at this execution site.

Aerial photos, taken on 17 July of an area around the Branjevo Military Farm, show many bodies lying in a field, as well as traces of the excavator that collected the bodies. Erdemović testified that, at around 3pm on 16 July, after he and fellow soldiers from the 10th Sabotage Detachment had finished executing prisoners at the Farm, they were told there was a group of 500 Bosnian prisoners from Srebrenica, trying to break out of a Dom Kultura club. Erdemović and other members of his unit refused to carry out more killings. They were told to meet with a Lieutenant Colonel at a café in Pilica. Erdemović and his fellow soldiers travelled to the café and, as they waited, could hear shots and grenades being detonated. The sounds lasted 15–20 minutes after which a soldier entered the café to inform them &quot;everything was over&quot;.

There were no survivors to explain exactly what happened in the Dom Kultura. The executions there were remarkable as this was not remote, but a town centre on the main road from Zvornik to Bijeljina. Over a year later, it was still possible to find physical evidence of this crime. As in Kravica, many traces of blood, hair and body tissue were found in the building, with cartridges and shells littered throughout the two storeys. It could be established that explosives and machine guns had been used. Human remains and personal possessions were found under the stage, where blood had dripped down through the floorboards.

Two of the three survivors of the executions at the Branjevo Military Farm, were arrested by Bosnian Serb police on 25 July and sent to the prisoner of war compound at Batkovici. One had been a member of the group separated from the women in Potočari on 13 July. The prisoners who were taken to Batkovici survived and testified before the Tribunal.

Čančari Road 12 was the site of the reinterment of at least 174 bodies, moved from the mass grave at the Branjevo Military Farm. Only 43 were complete sets of remains, most of which established that death was due to rifle fire. Of the 313 body parts found, 145 displayed gunshot wounds of a severity likely to prove fatal.

==== 14–17 July: Kozluk ====

The exact date of the executions at Kozluk is unknown, though most probably 15–16 July, partly due to its location, between Petkovići Dam and the Branjevo Military Farm. It falls within the pattern of ever more northerly execution sites: Orahovac on 14 July, Petkovići Dam on 15 July, the Branjevo Military Farm and Pilica Dom Kultura on 16 July. Another indication is that a Zvornik Brigade excavator spent eight hours in Kozluk on 16 July and a truck belonging to the same brigade made two journeys between Orahovac and Kozluk that day. A bulldozer is known to have been active in Kozluk on 18 and 19 July.

Among Bosnian refugees in Germany, there were rumours of executions in Kozluk, during which 500 or so prisoners were forced to sing Serbian songs as they were being transported to the execution site. Though no survivors have come forward, investigations in 1999 led to the discovery of a mass grave near Kozluk. This proved to be the location of execution as well, and lay alongside the Drina accessible only by driving through the barracks occupied by the Drina Wolves, a police unit of Republika Srpska. The grave was not dug specifically for the purpose: it had previously been a quarry and landfill site. Investigators found many shards of glass which the nearby &#x27;Vitinka&#x27; bottling plant had dumped there. This facilitated the process of establishing links with the secondary graves along Čančari Road. The grave at Kozluk had been partly cleared before 27 September 1995, but no fewer than 340 bodies were found there. In 237 cases, it was clear they had died as the result of rifle fire: 83 by a single shot to the head, 76 by one shot through the torso region, 72 by multiple bullet wounds, five by wounds to the legs and one by bullet wounds to the arm. Their ages were between 8 and 85. Some had been physically disabled, occasionally as the result of amputation. Many had been tied and bound using strips of clothing or nylon thread.

Along the Čančari Road are twelve known mass graves, of which only two—Čančari Road 3 and 12—have been investigated in detail (). Čančari Road 3 is known to have been a secondary grave linked to Kozluk, as shown by the glass fragments and labels from the Vitinka factory. The remains of 158 victims were found here, of which 35 bodies were more or less intact and indicated most had been killed by gunfire.

==== 13–18 July: Bratunac-Konjević Polje road ====
On 13 July, near Konjević Polje, Serb soldiers summarily executed hundreds of Bosniaks, including women and children. The men found attempting to escape by the Bratunac-Konjević Polje road were told the Geneva Convention would be observed if they gave themselves up. In Bratunac, men were told there were Serbian personnel standing by to escort them to Zagreb for a prisoner exchange. The visible presence of UN uniforms and vehicles, stolen from Dutchbat, were intended to contribute to the feeling of reassurance. On 17 to 18 July, Serb soldiers captured about 150–200 Bosnians in the vicinity of Konjevic Polje and summarily executed about one-half.

==== 18–19 July: Nezuk–Baljkovica frontline ====
After the closure of the corridor at Baljkovica, groups of stragglers nevertheless attempted to escape into Bosnian territory. Most were captured by VRS troops in the Nezuk–Baljkovica area and killed on the spot. In the vicinity of Nezuk, about 20 small groups surrendered to Bosnian Serb military forces. After the men surrendered, soldiers ordered them to line up and summarily executed them.

On 19 July, for example, a group of approximately 11 men was killed at Nezuk itself by units of the 16th Krajina Brigade, then operating under the direct command of the Zvornik Brigade. Reports reveal a further 13 men, all ARBiH soldiers, were killed at Nezuk on 19 July. The report of the march to Tuzla includes the account of an ARBiH soldier who witnessed executions carried out by police. He survived because 30 ARBiH soldiers were needed for an exchange of prisoners following the ARBiH&#x27;s capture of a VRS officer at Baljkovica. The soldier was exchanged in late 1995; at that time, there were still 229 men from Srebrenica in the Batkovici prisoner of war camp, including two who had been taken prisoner in 1994.

RS Ministry of the Interior forces searching the terrain from Kamenica as far as Snagovo killed eight Bosniaks. Around 200 Muslims armed with automatic and hunting rifles were reported to be hiding near the old road near Snagovo. During the morning, about 50 Bosniaks attacked the Zvornik Brigade line in the area of Pandurica, attempting to break through to Bosnian government territory. The Zvornik Public Security Centre planned to surround and destroy these two groups the following day using all available forces.

==== 20–22 July: Meces area ====
According to ICTY indictments of Karadžić and Mladić, on 20 to 21 July near Meces, VRS personnel, using megaphones, urged Bosniak men who had fled Srebrenica to surrender and assured them they would be safe. Approximately 350 men responded to these entreaties and surrendered. The soldiers then took approximately 150, instructed them to dig their graves and executed them.

=== After the massacre ===
During the days following the massacre, US spy planes overflew Srebrenica and took photos showing the ground in vast areas around the town had been removed, a sign of mass burials.

On 22 July, the commanding officer of the Zvornik Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Vinko Pandurević, requested the Drina Corps set up a committee to oversee the exchange of prisoners. He asked for instructions on where the prisoners of war his unit had already captured should be taken and to whom they should be handed over. Approximately 50 wounded captives were taken to the Bratunac hospital. Another group was taken to the Batkovići camp, and these were mostly exchanged later. On 25 July, the Zvornik Brigade captured 25 more ARBiH soldiers who were taken directly to the camp at Batkovići, as were 34 ARBiH men captured the following day. Zvornik Brigade reports up until 31 July continue to describe the search for refugees and the capture of small groups of Bosniaks.

Several Bosniaks managed to cross over the River Drina into Serbia at Ljubovija and Bajina Bašta. 38 were returned to RS. Some were taken to the Batkovići camp, where they were exchanged. The fate of the majority has not been established. Some attempting to cross the Drina drowned.

By 17 July, 201 Bosniak soldiers had arrived in Žepa, exhausted and many with light wounds. By 28 July another 500 had arrived in Žepa from Srebrenica. After 19 July, small Bosniak groups were hiding in the woods for days and months, trying to reach Tuzla. Numerous refugees found themselves cut off in the area around Mount Udrc. They did not know what to do next or where to go; they managed to stay alive by eating vegetables and snails. The MT Udrc had become a place for ambushing marchers, and the Bosnian Serbs swept through and, according to one survivor, killed many people there.

Meanwhile, the VRS had commenced the process of clearing the bodies from around Srebrenica, Žepa, Kamenica and Snagovo. Work parties and municipal services were deployed to help. In Srebrenica, the refuse that had littered the streets since the departure of the people was collected and burnt, the town disinfected and deloused.

==== Wanderers ====
Many people in the part of the column which had not succeeded in passing Kamenica, did not wish to give themselves up and decided to turn back towards Žepa. Others remained where they were, splitting up into smaller groups of no more than ten. Some wandered around for months, either alone or groups of two, four or six men. Once Žepa had succumbed to the Serb pressure, they had to move on once more, either trying to reach Tuzla or crossing the River Drina into Serbia.

=====Zvornik 7=====

The most famous group of seven men wandered about in occupied territory for the entire winter. On 10 May 1996, after nine months on the run and over six months after the end of the war, they were discovered in a quarry by American IFOR soldiers. They immediately turned over to the patrol; they were searched and their weapons were confiscated. The men said they had been in hiding near Srebrenica since its fall. They did not look like soldiers and the Americans decided this was a matter for the police. The operations officer of the American unit ordered that a Serb patrol should be escorted into the quarry whereupon the men would be handed over to the Serbs.

The prisoners said they were initially tortured after the transfer, but later treated relatively well. In April 1997 the local court in Republika Srpska convicted the group, known as the Zvornik 7, for illegal possession of firearms and three of them for the murder of four Serbian woodsmen. When announcing the verdict the presenter of the TV of Republika Srpska described them as &quot;the group of Muslim terrorists from Srebrenica who last year massacred Serb civilians&quot;. The trial was condemned by the international community as &quot;a flagrant miscarriage of justice&quot;, and the conviction quashed for &#x27;procedural reasons&#x27; following international pressure. In 1999, the three remaining defendants in the Zvornik 7 case were swapped for three Serbs serving 15 years each in a Bosnian prison.

==== Reburials in the secondary mass graves ====

From August to October 1995, there was organised effort to remove the bodies from primary gravesites and transport them to secondary and tertiary gravesites. In the ICTY court case &quot;Prosecutor v. Blagojević and Jokić&quot;, the trial chamber found that this reburial effort was an attempt to conceal evidence of the mass murders. The trial chamber found that the cover-up operation was ordered by the VRS Main Staff and carried out by members of the Bratunac and Zvornik Brigades.

The cover-up had a direct impact on the recovery and identification of the remains. The removal and reburial of the bodies caused them to become dismembered and co-mingled, making it difficult for forensic investigators to positively identify the remains. In one case, the remains of a single person were found in two locations, 30 km apart. In addition to the ligatures and blindfolds found, the effort to hide the bodies has been seen as evidence of the organised nature of the massacres and the non-combatant status of the victims.

=== Greek Volunteers controversy ===

10 Greek volunteers fought alongside the Serbs in the fall of Srebrenica. They were members of the Greek Volunteer Guard, a contingent of paramilitaries requested by Mladić, as an integral part of the Drina Corps. The volunteers were motivated to support their &quot;Orthodox brothers&quot; in battle. They raised the Greek flag at Srebrenica, at Mladić&#x27;s request, to honour &quot;the brave Greeks fighting on our side&quot; and Karadžić decorated four. In 2005, Greek deputy Andrianopoulos called for an investigation, Justice Minister Papaligouras commissioned an inquiry and in 2011, a judge said there was insufficient evidence to proceed. In 2009, Stavros Vitalis announced the volunteers were suing Takis Michas for libel over allegations in his book &quot;Unholy Alliance&quot;, which described Greece&#x27;s support for the Serbs during the war. Insisting the volunteers had simply taken part in the &quot;re-occupation&quot; of Srebrenica, Vitalis was present with Serb officers in &quot;all military operations&quot;.

== Post-war developments ==
=== 1995–2000: Indictments and UN Secretary-General&#x27;s report ===
In November 1995 Karadžić and Mladić were indicted by the ICTY for their alleged direct responsibility for the war crimes committed against the Bosnian Muslim population of Srebrenica. In 1999, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted his report on the Fall of Srebrenica. He acknowledged the international community as a whole had to accept its share of responsibility, for its response to the ethnic cleansing that culminated in the murder of 7,000 unarmed civilians from the town designated by the Security Council as a &quot;safe area&quot;.

=== 2002: Dutch government report ===
The failure of Dutchbat to protect the enclave became a national trauma in the Netherlands and led to long-running discussions. In 1996, the Dutch government asked the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies to research the events. The report was published in 2002—&quot;Srebrenica: a &#x27;safe&#x27; area&quot;. It concluded the Dutchbat mission was not well considered and well-nigh impossible. The report is often cited, however, the Institute for War and Peace Reporting labelled it &quot;controversial&quot;, as &quot;the sheer abundance of information makes it possible for anyone to pluck from it whatever they need to make their point&quot;. One author claimed some sources were &quot;unreliable&quot;, and only used to support another author&#x27;s argument. Responding to the report, the Dutch government accepted partial political responsibility for the circumstances in which the massacre happened and the Second Kok cabinet resigned.

===2002: First Republika Srpska report===
In September 2002, the Republika Srpska Office of Relations with the ICTY issued the &quot;Report about Case Srebrenica&quot;. The document, by Darko Trifunović, was endorsed by leading Bosnian Serb politicians. It concluded that 1,800 Bosnian Muslim soldiers died during fighting and a 100 more from exhaustion. &quot;The number of Muslim soldiers killed by Bosnian Serbs out of personal revenge or lack of knowledge of international law is probably about 100 ... It is important to uncover the names of the perpetrators to accurately and unequivocally establish whether or not these were isolated instances.&quot; The report examined the mass graves, claiming they were made for hygiene reasons, questioning the legitimacy of the missing person lists and undermining a key witness&#x27; mental health and military history. The International Crisis Group and UN condemned the manipulation of their statements.

=== 2003: Srebrenica Genocide Memorial ===
In September 2003, former US President Bill Clinton officially opened the Srebrenica Genocide Memorial to honour the victims of the genocide. The total cost was around $6 million. &quot;We must pay tribute to the innocent lives, many of them children who were snuffed out in what must be called genocidal madness&quot;, Clinton said.

=== 2004: Second Republika Srpska report and apology ===
In March 2003, the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision which ordered the Republika Srpska (RS) to conduct a full investigation into the Srebrenica events, and disclose the results by September. The Chamber had no coercive power to implement the decision, especially as dissolved in late 2003. The RS then published reports, in September 2003, which the Human Rights Chamber concluded did not fulfil the RS&#x27; obligations. In October 2003, The High Representative, Paddy Ashdown, lamented that &quot;getting the truth from the [Bosnian Serb] government is like extracting rotten teeth&quot;. He did, however, welcome a recommendation to form an independent commission to investigate Srebrenica and issue a report within six months.

The Srebrenica commission, officially titled the &quot;Commission for Investigation of the Events in and around Srebrenica between 10 and 19 July 1995&quot;, was established in December 2003, and submitted its final report on 4 June 2004, and then an addendum in October 2004 after delayed information was supplied. The report acknowledged men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serbs, citing a provisional figure of 7,800. Because of &quot;limited time&quot; and to &quot;maximize resources&quot;, the commission &quot;accepted the historical background and the facts stated in the second-instance judgment &#x27;Prosecutor vs. Radislav Krstić&#x27;, when the ICTY convicted him for &#x27;assisting and supporting genocide&#x27; in Srebrenica&quot;.

The findings remain disputed by Serb nationalists, who claim it was pressured by the High Representative, given the earlier RS government report which exonerated the Serbs was dismissed. Nevertheless, Dragan Čavić, the president of Republika Srpska, acknowledged in a televised address that Serb forces killed several thousand civilians in violation of international law, and asserted that Srebrenica was a dark chapter in Serb history. On 10 November 2004, the government of Republika Srpska issued an official apology. The statement came after a government review of the report. &quot;The report makes it clear that enormous crimes were committed in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995. The Bosnian Serb Government shares the pain of the families of the Srebrenica victims, is truly sorry and apologises for the tragedy&quot;, the Bosnian Serb government said.

==== Republika Srpska Srebrenica Working Group ====
After a request by Ashdown, the RS established a working group to implement the recommendations of the report by the Srebrenica Commission. The group was to analyze the documentation in the report&#x27;s confidential annexes and identify all possible perpetrators who were officials in RS institutions. A report on 1 April 2005 identified 892 such persons still employed by the RS, and the information was provided to the State Prosecutor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the understanding names would not be made public until official proceedings opened. On 4 October 2005, the working group said they had identified 25,083 people who were involved in the massacre, including 19,473 members of Bosnian Serb armed forces that actively gave orders or directly took part.

=== 2005: Release of Scorpions massacre video ===

On 1 June 2005, video evidence was introduced at the Slobodan Milošević trial to testify to the involvement of police from Serbia in the massacre. The video, the only undestroyed copy of 20 and previously available for rental in the Serbian town of Šid, was obtained and submitted to the ICTY by Nataša Kandić, director of the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center.

The video shows an Orthodox priest blessing members of a Serbian unit known as the &quot;Scorpions&quot;. Later these soldiers are shown physically abusing civilians. They were later identified as four minors as young as 16 and two men in their early twenties. The footage shows the execution of four of the civilians and them lying dead in a field. The cameraman expresses disappointment the battery is almost out. The soldiers then ordered the two remaining captives to take the dead bodies into a nearby barn, where they were also killed upon completing this.

The video caused outrage in Serbia. Following its showing, the Serbian government arrested some former soldiers identified on it. The event was covered by the &quot;Danas&quot; newspaper, and radio and television station B92. Nura Alispahić, mother of 16-year-old Azmir Alispahić, saw her son&#x27;s execution on television. She said she was already aware of his death and had been told his body was burned following the execution; his remains were among those buried in Potočari in 2003. The executions took place on 16/17 July, in Trnovo, about 30 minutes from the Scorpions&#x27; base near Sarajevo.

On 10 April 2007, a special war crimes court in Belgrade convicted four former members of the &quot;Scorpions&quot; of war crimes, treating the killings as an isolated war crime unrelated to the Srebrenica genocide and ignoring allegations the Scorpions were acting under the authority of the Serbian Interior Ministry, MUP.

===2005: 10th anniversary===
In June 2005, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution commemorating the 10th anniversary, by 370 to 1 (Ron Paul). It stated the &quot;innocent people executed at Srebrenica ... should be solemnly remembered and honored; the policies ... implemented by Serb forces ... meet the terms ... in ... the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.&quot; Missouri passed a resolution recognising the genocide and St. Louis issued a proclamation declaring 11 July Srebrenica Remembrance Day.

In his message to the commemoration, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan paid tribute to the victims of &quot;a terrible crime – the worst on European soil since the Second World War&quot;, on a date &quot;marked as a grim reminder of man&#x27;s inhumanity to man&quot;. He said the &quot;first duty of the international community was to uncover and confront the full truth about what happened, a hard truth for those who serve the UN because great nations failed to respond adequately. There should have been stronger military forces in place, and a stronger will to use them&quot;. Annan added that the UN bore its share of responsibility, having made serious errors of judgement, &quot;rooted in a philosophy of impartiality and non-violence which, however admirable, was unsuited to the conflict in Bosnia; because of that the tragedy of Srebrenica would haunt the UN&#x27;s history forever&quot;. Bosnian Serb police found bombs at the memorial site, just days before the ceremony, when more than 50,000 people, including international politicians, were to attend. The bombs would have caused widespread loss of life.

=== 2006: Further mass graves and list of participants ===
By 2006, 42 mass graves had been uncovered. 2,070 victims had been identified, while body parts in 7,000 bags awaited identification. In August 2006 over 1,000 body parts were exhumed from a mass grave in Kamenica.

In August 2006, Sarajevo newspaper Oslobođenje published a list of 892 Bosnian Serbs who had allegedly participated in the massacre and believed to still be employed by state institutions. They were listed among 28,000 Bosnian Serbs reported to have taken part by a Republika Srpska report. The list had been withheld from publication with the report, by the chief prosecutor of the Bosnian War Crimes Chamber, Marinko Jurčević who claimed &quot;publishing this information might jeopardise the ongoing investigations&quot;.

In December 2006, the Dutch government awarded the Dutch UN peacekeepers an insignia because they believed they &quot;deserved recognition for their behaviour in difficult circumstances&quot;, noting the limited mandate and ill-equipped mission. However, survivors and relatives called it a &quot;humiliating decision&quot; and responded with protest rallies in The Hague, Assen and Sarajevo.

=== 2007–08: Arrests of Tolimir and Karadžić===
In May 2007, former Bosnian Serb general Zdravko Tolimir was apprehended by police from Serbia and the Bosnian Serb republic. He was turned over to NATO forces at the Banja Luka airport where he was read the ICTY indictment and arrested. Mladić&#x27;s deputy in charge of intelligence and security, and a key commander, Tolimir is believed to have been an organiser of the network protecting Mladić, helping him elude justice. Tolimir—&quot;Chemical Zdravko&quot;—is infamous for requesting the use of chemical weapons and proposing military strikes against refugees at Zepa. In June 2007, he was turned over to the ICTY. Radovan Karadžić, with similar charges, was arrested in Belgrade in 2008, after 13 years on the run, and brought before Belgrade&#x27;s War Crimes Court.

=== 2009: EU Parliament resolution ===
On 15 January 2009, the European Parliament voted in favour of a resolution calling for recognition of 11 July as a day for EU commemoration of the genocide. Bosnian Serb politicians rejected it, stating such a commemoration is unacceptable to the Republika Srpska.

=== 2010 and 2013: Serbia&#x27;s official apologies ===
In 2010, the Serbian Parliament passed a resolution condemning the massacre, and apologizing for Serbia not doing more to prevent it. The motion was passed narrowly with 127 out of 250 MPs voting in favour, with 173 legislators present. The Socialist Party of Serbia, formerly under Slobodan Milošević and under new leadership, voted for. Opposition parties claimed the text was &quot;shameful&quot;, either stating the wording was too strong or too weak. Some victims&#x27; relatives were unhappy with the apology, as it did not use the word &#x27;genocide&#x27;, but rather pointed at the Bosnian genocide case ruling. President Boris Tadić said the declaration is the highest expression of patriotism and it represents distancing from the crimes. Sulejman Tihić, former Bosniak member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina must adopt a similar resolution condemning crimes against Serbs and Croats. In April 2013, President Tomislav Nikolić stated: &quot;I kneel and ask for forgiveness for Serbia for the crime committed in Srebrenica. I apologise for the crimes committed by any individual in the name of our state and our people.&quot;

=== 2010: Second Republika Srpska report revision ===
On 21 April 2010, the government of Milorad Dodik, the prime minister of Republika Srpska, initiated a revision of the 2004 report saying the numbers killed were exaggerated and the report was manipulated by a former peace envoy. The Office of the High Representative responded by saying: &quot;The Republika Srpska government should reconsider its conclusions and align itself with the facts and legal requirements and act accordingly, rather than inflicting emotional distress on the survivors, torture history and denigrate the public image of the country&quot;. On 12 July 2010, at the 15th anniversary, Milorad Dodik said he acknowledged the killings, but did not regard what happened as genocide.

=== 2011: Arrest of Mladić ===
In May 2011, Mladić was arrested in Lazarevo, Serbia after remaining at large for 16 years, sheltered by Serbian and Bosnian Serb security forces and family. His capture was considered to be a pre-condition for Serbia obtaining candidate status for EU membership. See Legal proceedings for his trial.

=== 2015: Russia vetoes UN resolution ===
In July 2015, Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have condemned the massacre as a genocide. It was intended to mark the 20th anniversary. China, Nigeria, Angola and Venezuela abstained and the remaining 10 members voted in favour. The veto was praised by Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić who said Russia had &quot;prevented an attempt of smearing the entire Serbian nation as genocidal&quot; and proven itself as a true and honest friend.

=== 2024: International Day of Commemoration ===
In May 2024, July 11 was designated as the annual &quot;International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica&quot; by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 78/282.

The U.N. resolution, which was sponsored by Germany and Rwanda, was passed with 84 countries voting for the resolution, 68 abstaining, and 19 voting against. Politico described Serbia launching a ″full-blown diplomatic offensive″ to block the initiative, with Serbian leaders staging multiple press conferences and visiting the U.N. headquarters to meet with key stakeholders to try to sway the vote.

== Victims ==
&quot;The Bosnian Book of the Dead&quot; documented 8,331 victims killed in the massacre. The figure includes civilians and 1,416 soldiers who were taken as prisoners of war. Of the 8,331, 5,113 were from Srebrenica, 1,766 from Bratunac, 900 from Vlasenica, 437 from Zvornik and 115 from Rogatica/Žepa.

 the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) had identified 6,993 persons missing from the fall of Srebrenica, mostly through analysing DNA profiles extracted from exhumed remains and matching them to profiles of relatives of the missing. The ICMP estimates total deaths was just over 8,000.

== Legal proceedings ==
=== International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ===
In 1993, the UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to try those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law, including genocide.

General Radislav Krstić, who led the assault alongside Mladić, was convicted in 2001 of aiding and abetting genocide and received a sentence of 35 years. Colonel Vidoje Blagojević received 18 years for crimes against humanity. Krstić was the first European to be convicted of genocide since the Nuremberg trials, and only the third person convicted under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The ICTY&#x27;s final ruling against Krstić, judicially recognized the Srebrenica massacre, as an act of genocide:
Milošević was accused of genocide, or complicity in genocide, including in Srebrenica, but died in 2006 during his trial. In June 2010, seven senior Serb military and police officers, Vujadin Popović, Ljubiša Beara, Drago Nikolić, Ljubomir Borovčanin, Vinko Pandurević, Radivoje Miletić and Milan Gvero, were found guilty of various crimes, including genocide. The former chief of the general staff of the Yugoslav Army, Momčilo Perišić, was sentenced to 27 years for aiding and abetting murder, because he provided salaries, ammunition, staff and fuel to the VRS officers. However, the evidence proved Perišić&#x27;s inability to impose binding orders on Mladić. Zdravko Tolimir, a former general in the Army of the Republika Srpska, was accused of participating in the &quot;criminal enterprise to remove the Muslim population&quot; from Srebrenica and Zepa. He was convicted of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2012.

Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić were indicted for genocide, and complicity in genocide, including in Srebrenica. The trial of Radovan Karadžić began in 2010, and in 2016 he was convicted of genocide in Srebrenica and other crimes; he was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2017, the ICTY found Mladić guilty on 10 counts of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and sentenced him to life in prison. As the top military officer with command responsibility, Mladić was deemed responsible for the Srebrenica massacre.

In 2023, the follow-up International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals sentenced Serbian State Security officers Jovica Stanišić and Franko Simatović for aiding and abetting murder and persecution of six Bosniak men in Trnovo in 1995, through their control of Serb paramilitary, Scorpions, and sentenced each to 15 years. The Tribunal concluded:
=== International Court of Justice ===

The Srebrenica genocide was the core issue of the landmark Bosnian genocide case at the International Court of Justice through which Bosnia and Herzegovina accused Serbia and Montenegro of genocide. The ICJ presented its judgement in February 2007, which concurred with ICTY&#x27;s recognition of the Srebrenica massacre as genocide. It cleared Serbia of direct involvement, but ruled that Belgrade breached international law by failing to prevent the genocide, and failing to try or transfer the persons accused to the ICTY, under its obligations in the Genocide Convention, particularly in respect of Mladić. Citing national security, Serbia obtained permission from the ICTY to keep parts of its military archives out of the public eye during Milošević&#x27;s trial. This may have decisively affected the ICJ&#x27;s judgement in the lawsuit against Serbia, as the archives were not on the ICTY&#x27;s public record – although the ICJ could have, but did not, subpoena the documents. The Chief prosecutor&#x27;s office, rejected allegations there was a deal with Belgrade to conceal documents from the ICJ case.

=== National courts ===

==== Netherlands ====
Survivors and victims&#x27; relatives sought to establish the responsibility of the Netherlands and UN, in Dutch courts. In one case, 11 plaintiffs including &quot;Mothers of Srebrenica&quot;, asked the court to rule that the Netherlands and UN breached their obligation to prevent genocide and hold them jointly liable to pay compensation. In July 2008, the court ruled it had no jurisdiction against the UN; the plaintiffs appealed this ruling in relation to UN immunity.

Another action was brought by a former UN interpreter Hasan Nuhanović and the family of Rizo Mustafić, an electrician employed by the UN at Srebrenica. They claimed Dutch troops, responsible for security in the UN-protected zone, allowed VRS troops to kill Nuhanović&#x27;s relatives and Mustafić. They argued the Dutch Government had &quot;de facto&quot; operational command, in accordance with the Dutch Constitution, which grants the government superior command over military forces. In September 2008, the district court dismissed these claims and held that the Netherlands could not be held responsible, because the Dutchbat peacekeepers were operating in Bosnia under a UN mandate and operational command had been transferred to the UN. In July 2011, the Dutch court of appeal reversed this and held that the state was responsible for, and indeed actively coordinated the evacuation once Srebrenica fell, and therefore responsible for the decision to dismiss Nuhanović&#x27;s brother and Mustafić from the compound. The court held that this decision was wrong, because the Dutch soldiers should have known they were in great danger of being tortured or killed. Both claimants were therefore eligible for compensation. In September 2013, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands dismissed a government appeal, a judgment the government accepted. The court found it was the government which had &quot;effective control&quot; over its troops. The ruling meant relatives could pursue the government for compensation.

On 16 July 2014, a Dutch court held the Netherlands liable for the killings of more than 300 Bosniaks, who had been expelled from the compound and the state was not liable for other deaths. The decision was upheld by The Hague appeals court in 2017. On 19 July 2019 the Supreme Court ruled the Dutch state was liable for 10%, for the 350 Bosnian men expelled from the compound. The 10% liability was the court&#x27;s assessment of the likelihood the soldiers could have prevented the killings.

== Analyses ==
=== Role of Bosnian forces ===
In response to the suggestion Bosniak forces in Srebrenica made no adequate attempt to defend the town, a report by the UN Secretary-General delivered to the United Nations General Assembly in 1999 states:

=== Disputed Serb casualties ===
Serbs suffered casualties during military forays led by Naser Orić. The controversy over the nature and number of casualties came to a head in 2005. According to Human Rights Watch, the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party &quot;launched an aggressive campaign to prove that Muslims had committed crimes against thousands of Serbs in the area&quot; which &quot;was intended to diminish the significance of the July 1995 crime.&quot; A briefing by the ICTY Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) from July 2005 noted Serb deaths in the region alleged by Serbian authorities had increased from 1,400 to 3,500, a figure the OTP stated does, &quot;not reflect the reality.&quot; The briefing cited previous accounts:
* The Republika Srpska&#x27;s Commission for War Crimes gave the number of Serb victims as 995; 520 in Bratunac and 475 in Srebrenica.
* &quot;The Chronicle of Our Graves&quot; by Milivoje Ivanišević, president of the Belgrade Centre for Investigating Crimes Committed against the Serbs, estimated around 1,200.
* &quot;For the Honourable Cross and Golden Freedom&quot;, a book published by the RS Ministry of Interior, referred to 641 Serb victims

The accuracy of these numbers is challenged: the OTP noted that although Ivanišević&#x27;s book estimated around 1,200 Serbs were killed, personal details were only available for 624. The validity of labeling some casualties as &quot;victims&quot; is also challenged: studies have found a significant majority of military, compared to civilian casualties. This is in line with the nature of the conflict—Serb casualties died in raids by Bosniak forces on outlying villages used as military outposts for attacks on Srebrenica. For example, Kravica was attacked by Bosniak forces on Orthodox Christmas Day, 7 January 1993. Some Serb sources, such as Ivanišević, allege the village&#x27;s 353 inhabitants were &quot;virtually completely destroyed&quot;. In fact, VRS&#x27; own records state 46 Serbs died, while the OTP&#x27;s investigation also found 43 people were killed. Nevertheless, the event continues to be cited by Serb sources as the key example of crimes committed by Bosniak forces around Srebrenica. As for casualties in Kravica, Šiljković, Bjelovac, Fakovići and Sikirić, the judgement states that the prosecution failed to present convincing evidence the Bosnian forces were responsible, because the Serb forces used artillery in the fighting in those villages. In the case of Bjelovac, Serbs even used warplanes. Another analysis was by the Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo, a non-partisan institution, whose data have been evaluated by international experts. Its review found Serb casualties in the Bratunac municipality amounted to 119 civilians and 424 soldiers. It established that, although the 383 Serb victims buried in the Bratunac military cemetery are presented as casualties of ARBiH units from Srebrenica, 139, about a third, had fought and died elsewhere.

Serb sources maintain that casualties prior to the creation of the safe area gave rise to Serb demands for revenge against the Bosniaks based in Srebrenica. The ARBiH raids are presented as a key motivating factor for the genocide. This view is echoed by international sources, including the 2002 report commissioned by the Netherlands. Paul Mojzes notes much animosity towards the men of Srebrenica stems from May 1992 to January 1993, where forces under Orić&#x27;s leadership attacked and destroyed scores of Serbian villages. Evidence indicated Serbs had been tortured, mutilated and others burned alive, when their houses were torched.

The efforts to explain the massacre as motivated by revenge have been dismissed as bad faith attempts to justify the genocide. The ICTY Outreach Programme notes that the claim Bosnian Serb forces killed the prisoners, in revenge for crimes by Bosnian Muslims, provides no defence under law. Experienced officers would be aware of this. The programme stated that to offer revenge as a justification is to attack the rule of law, and civilization itself, and that revenge does not provide moral justification for killing people, simply because they share the ethnicity of others who perpetrated crimes. The planning and mobilization of substantial resources required orders to be given at a high command level.

===Lack of military logic===
During Radislav Krstić&#x27;s trial, the prosecution&#x27;s military advisor, Richard Butler, pointed out that by carrying out a mass execution, the Serb Army deprived themselves of an extremely valuable bargaining counter. Butler suggested that they would have had far more to gain had they taken the men in Potočari as prisoners of war, under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN troops. It might then have been possible to enter into an exchange deal or they might have been able to force political concessions. Based on this reasoning, the ensuing mass murder defied military explanation.

===Dutchbat===
Brigadier General Hagrup Haukland was UNPROFOR&#x27;s commander of the sector in which the killings started on 11 July, when he was on vacation. His subordinate, Colonel Brantz, phoned Haukland twice on 9 July about the crisis. Confusion within Haukland&#x27;s staff has been attributed in part, to his being slow to return to his place of work. The 2002 report &quot;Srebrenica: a &#x27;safe&#x27; area&quot;, and a military advisor, said &quot;The cadres consisted of clans of Norwegian, Pakistani and Dutch military that were incapable of adequate mutual cooperation.&quot; The report did not assign any blame to Haukland for the massacre. In 2005 an unnamed officer on Haukland&#x27;s staff, disputed the claim by Haukland and Norway&#x27;s Chief of Defence, Arne Solli, that the attack was a surprise. The officer said &quot;We knew early on that the Serbs were amassing their forces around Srebrenica. At the end of June, Haukland informed the headquarters at Sarajevo again and again...&quot;. In 2006 it was reported Haukland regularly informed Sollie about...Haukland&#x27;s sector, and when Haukland departed Bosnia on his vacation to Norway, they travelled on the same plane.

In 2010, John Sheehan, NATO&#x27;s Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (1994–97), told the US Senate that the Dutch had &quot;made a conscious effort to socialise their military...it includes open homosexuality&quot;, claiming gay soldiers could result in events like Srebrenica. He claimed his opinion was shared by Dutch military leadership, mentioning &quot;Hankman Berman&quot;, who Sheehan said had told him the presence of gay soldiers had sapped morale and contributed to the disaster. General Henk van den Breemen denied saying this and called Sheehan&#x27;s comments &quot;total nonsense&quot;; the Dutch authorities described them as &quot;disgraceful&quot; and &quot;unworthy of a soldier&quot;. Sheehan apologised to Dutch military officials and blamed instead &quot;the rules of engagement...developed by a political system with conflicting priorities and an ambivalent understanding of how to use the military.&quot;

===Criticism of the UN Special Representative===
The Dutch government report from 2002, &quot;Srebrenica: a &#x27;safe&#x27; area&quot;, criticised the choice of Stoltenberg as a mediator. In 2005, Professor Arne Johan Vetlesen said, &quot;Thorvald Stoltenberg&#x27;s co-responsibility in Srebrenica boils down to the fact that, over three years as a top mediator, he helped to create a climate—diplomatically, politically and indirectly militarily—that was such that Mladic calculated correctly, when he figured he could do exactly as he wanted with Srebrenica&#x27;s Muslim population&quot;.

== Denial ==

Scepticism has ranged from challenging judicial recognition of the killings as genocide, to the denial of a massacre having taken place. The finding of genocide by the ICJ and ICTY, has been disputed on evidential and theoretical grounds. The number of the dead has been questioned as has the nature of their deaths. It has been alleged that considerably fewer than 8,000 were killed and/or that most died in battle, rather than execution. It has been claimed the interpretation of &quot;genocide&quot; is refuted by the survival of the women and children.

During the war, Milošević had effective control of most Serbian media. Following its end, denial of Serbian responsibility for the killings was widespread among Serbians. Sonja Biserko and Edina Bečirević, have pointed to a culture of denial of the genocide in Serbian society, taking many forms and present in political discourse, the media, the law and the educational system.

<doc id="814724" wikidata="Q217194" url="?curid=814724" title="Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah">
<text>Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah (29 June 1926 – 15 January 2006) (), also known as Jaber III, was Emir of Kuwait from 31 December 1977 until his death in 2006.

The third monarch to rule Kuwait since its independence from Britain, Jaber had previously served as minister of finance and economy from 1962 to 1965 when he was appointed prime minister prior to becoming Kuwait&#x27;s ruler. He was the 13th ruler in the family dynasty.

== Early life and education ==
Jaber was born on 29 June 1926 in Kuwait City. He was the third son of Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.

Jaber received his early education at Al-Mubarakiya School, Al-Ahmediya School, and Al-Sharqiya School, and was subsequently tutored privately in English, Arabic, religion and the sciences.

His brother Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was killed in 1990 in the Gulf War in front of Dasman Palace.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===

In 1962, he was appointed Kuwait&#x27;s minister of finance when the ministry was established. In this position, Jaber was tasked with putting the new Kuwaiti dinar into circulation and establishing the Kuwaiti Currency Board, of which he was the chair. As minister, Jaber adopted, and was the first chairman of, the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development from 1962 to 1964. The Fund provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries. The country&#x27;s oil revenues transformed it from a largely rural seafaring society to a modern state. During this time, the Fund expanded to aid five countries and gave loans to another eight. The money going into the fund came from oil earnings.

After Iraq claimed sovereignty over Kuwait in 1961, following independence from Great Britain, Al-Sabah led a delegation to the Arab League to resolve the issue. The United Kingdom informed Iraqi Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim that it would militarily assist Kuwait in the event of military action, leading to Operation Vantage. Iraq recognised Kuwait&#x27;s independence in 1963, though it disputed the borders.

=== Iran–Iraq War ===
Kuwait found itself geographically in the middle of the Iran–Iraq War that took place from 1980 to 1988. Throughout the war, the country suffered from many security threats, including a series of bombings. In 1986, one year after an attack on Jaber&#x27;s motorcade, there was an attack on an oil installation, which almost caused the shutdown of Kuwait&#x27;s oil industry.

=== Gulf War ===
Some sources claim that the task of the invading Iraqi forces was to capture or kill Jaber. However, such a claimed plan was not possible with the exile of Jaber and his government to Saudi Arabia within hours of the invasion where they ran the Kuwaiti exiled government from a hotel in Ta&#x27;if, Saudi Arabia.

From Ta&#x27;if, Jaber set up his government so that its ministers were in communication with the people still in Kuwait. The government was able to direct an underground armed resistance made up of both military and civilian forces and was able to provide public services to the Kuwaiti people who remained, such as emergency care through the funds that it had saved from oil revenues. In the meantime, Jaber and his government lobbied to receive military support action against Iraq before and during the Gulf War. When the war ended on 28 February 1991, Jaber remained in Saudi Arabia while declaring three months of martial law, causing the accusation that he was trying to monopolize too much power for the small constitutional monarchy. He returned to Kuwait in March 1991, after American-led efforts to restore his rule and remove the Iraqi army. By imposing martial law, government officials were able to ensure that there were no Iraqis still in Kuwait who may have attempted to once again overthrow the government. They were also tasked with making sure that the country was safe enough for Jaber and his government to return, which they eventually did on 15 March 1991.

On 15 March 1991, Jaber returned to Kuwait, staying at the private home of a wealthy Kuwaiti as his own palace had been destroyed. He was met with a symbolic arrival with several dozens cars filled with people honking their car horns and waving Kuwaiti flags who tried to follow the Emir&#x27;s convoy.

=== 2003 US invasion of Iraq ===
During the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, and unlike the ruling family of Saudi Arabia, Jaber openly allowed the United States to use Kuwait as a base.

== Personal life and death ==
Al-Sabah had at least 4 wives by 1997, and 7 children.

In September 2001, Jaber suffered from a stroke and went to the United Kingdom for treatment. He died on 15 January 2006, aged 79, from the cerebral hemorrhage that he had suffered in 2001 and was succeeded by the Crown Prince Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah. The government announced a 40-day period of mourning and closed office for three days. Bahrain has declared forty days of mourning; Jordan announced seven days of mourning; Yemen, Egypt, Iraq, Algeria, Oman, Syria, Pakistan, Mauritius and the State of Palestine all declared three days of mourning; India declared one day of mourning. He was buried at Sulaibikhat Cemetery alongside his kin.

<text>The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR; also known by its French acronym FORPRONU: &quot;Force de Protection des Nations Unies&quot;) was the first United Nations peacekeeping force in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Yugoslav Wars. The force was formed in February 1992 and its mandate ended in March 1995, with the peacekeeping mission restructuring into three other forces (the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in the Republic of Macedonia, and the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) in Croatia, with restructured UNPROFOR operations ongoing in Bosnia and Herzegovina until their replacement by NATO and EU missions in December 1995).

==Personnel== 
UNPROFOR was composed of nearly 25,000 personnel. It consisted of troops from Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. According to the UN, there were 167 fatalities amongst UNPROFOR personnel during the course of the force&#x27;s mandate. Of those who died, three were military observers, 159 were other military personnel, one was a member of the civilian police, two were international civilian staff and two were local staff.

The commanders of UNPROFOR were:

Prominent officers :
*Major-General Lewis MacKenzie (Canada) Sector Sarajevo 1992
*General Philippe Morillon (France) from October 1992 to July 1993
*Lieutenant-General Francis Briquemont (Belgium) 12 July 1993 to 24 January 1994
*Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose (United Kingdom) from 24 January 1994 to 25 February 1995
*Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith (United Kingdom) from 25 February 1995

==Mandate==

===Croatia===
UNPROFOR was created by UN Security Council Resolution 743 on 21 February 1992 during the Croatian War of Independence. The initial mandate of UNPROFOR was to ensure stable conditions for peace talks, and security in three demilitarized &quot;safe-haven&quot; enclaves designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs). These were located in various regions before the Republic of Croatia received full membership status in the United Nations (UN), but were controlled by the self-styled Republic of Serbian Krajina.

In 1992, the mandate was extended to so-called &quot;pink zones&quot; controlling access to the UNPAs (UNSC Resolution 762), some border control and monitoring of civilian access to the Pink Zones (UNSC Resolution 769), and control of the demilitarisation of the Prevlaka peninsula near Dubrovnik (UNSC Resolution 779).

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
In contrast to that of Croatia, the UNPROFOR mandate for Bosnia and Herzegovina was not to monitor a preexisting cease-fire. The mandate can essentially be divided into four phases:

*Phase 1: Aid to Sarajevo - Beginning on 5 June 1992, UNPROFOR was responsible for the protection of Sarajevo airport as mandated by Resolution 758 for humanitarian purposes. UNPROFOR would run a security corridor for aid convoys between the airport and the city.
*Phase 2: Escort of Humanitarian Aid - On 14 September 1992, UNPROFOR was given a mandate (United Nations Security Council Resolution 776) by the United Nations Security Council to provide protection to humanitarian organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other activities as requested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees such as scheduling convoys and negotiating safe passage. The Force would also be permitted to use self-defence if armed persons attempted to prevent it from carrying out its mandate.
*Phase 3: The Protection of Safe Areas - The next expansion of the mandate was on 16 April 1993 with United Nations Security Council Resolution 819 declaring the town of Srebrenica a &quot;safe area&quot; free &quot;from armed attack or any other hostile act.&quot; In May 1993, Bihać, Sarajevo, Goražde, Žepa and Tuzla were also added as &quot;safe areas&quot;.
*Phase 4: Monitoring the Muslim-Croat Federation and Weapons Exclusion Zones - Eventually, UNPROFOR monitored a US-brokered cease-fires in Bosnia in February 1994, creating the Muslim-Croat Federation. UNPROFOR was responsible for monitoring the zones of separation and weapons control points. In addition, the UNSC increased UNPROFOR&#x27;s authorized strength to monitor weapons exclusion zones, but never actually altered the operation&#x27;s mandate.

On 31 March 1995, UNPROFOR was restructured into three coordinated peace operations. On 20 December 1995, the forces of UNPROFOR were reflagged under the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), whose task was to implement the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (GFAP – otherwise known as the Dayton Accords or Dayton Agreement).

==Course of action==

===February 1992 – March 1993===
Cedric Thornberry was director of UNPROFOR Civil Affairs at the beginning of the mission in February 1992. By the end of its first mandate in March 1993, UNPROFOR had some success in restoring peace in Croatia, notably obtaining the removal of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) in May 1992. However, civil unrest was such that terror, discrimination and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; were still present. Local Serb forces managed to complete their cleansing of the UNPA areas, started in 1991, that left only 279 Croats there out of a pre-war population of 102,000.

The situation was problematic, mostly due to non-cooperation by local Serb authorities, and because of later major Croat military offensives. Additionally, the situation for which UNPROFOR had been designed and anticipated for had significantly changed. The Croat side now refused to negotiate its sovereignty on the UNPAs and Pink Zones, which the Serb part would not accept. Establishment of the &quot;Republic of Serbian Krajina&quot; further complicated the situation.

The Opening of the Sarajevo Airport was conducted by the Canadian Operational Force, which moved within the Theater of Operations from Croatia (Surac) to the combat zone of Sarajevo. The Canadian Force included the French-speaking Royal 22e Régiment, with the attachment of N Company of the English-speaking 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment. The Canadian Contingent was deployed by train from Canadian Forces Base Baden-Soellingen and CFB Lahr, Germany.

In spite of hostile actions, Sarajevo international airport had successfully remained open. In the period from 3 July 1992 to 31 January 1993, the humanitarian airlift organised by UNHCR under UNPROFOR protection brought in 2,476 aircraft carrying 27,460 tons of food, medicines and other relief goods.

Distribution of humanitarian aid was disrupted due to non-cooperation and even hostile actions (mines, small arms fire, RPG) of the parties in the field, especially from the Bosnian Serb forces. Nonetheless, from November 1992 to January 1993, a total of some 34,600 tons of relief supplies had been delivered to an estimated 800,000 beneficiaries in 110 locations throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===March 1993 – February 1994===
====Croat incursions====

On 6 July 1993, new tensions arose following the Croatian government&#x27;s decision to re-open the strategic Maslenica bridge on 18 July – Croatia was cut in half while the bridge was in Serb hands. The UNPROFOR forces who were mandated to monitor the Croat forces&#x27; withdrawal from the area had been unable to deploy, due to the refusal of access by Croat authorities. The Serbs shelled the bridge, partially destroying it on 2 August. On 12 August, negotiations for a cease-fire began in Geneva, but were unsuccessful. Eventually, Croat forces retreated to their positions previously occupied before the incursion.

====Operation &quot;Deny Flight&quot;====
In mid-March, unidentified airplanes dropped bombs onto villages in the vicinity of Srebrenica, violating the &quot;No-Flight zones&quot; for the first time. The Bosnian Serbs were accused of the bombing but denied responsibility. On 31 March, a resolution was voted authorising the nations contributing to UNPROFOR to take &quot;all necessary measures&quot; to prevent military flights from the belligerents in the no-flight zones (&quot;Operation Deny Flight&quot;). French, Dutch, and American airplanes were deployed to enforce the resolution. In total, until 1 December 1994, 3317 violations were observed. On 28 February 1994, four military aircraft were shot down by NATO fighter jets over Bosnia and Herzegovina.

====Safe areas====

From March 1993, Serb paramilitary units killed a great number of civilians, destroyed habitations, prevented the UNHCR from delivering humanitarian aid, and forced thousands of Bosnian refugees to flee to the town of Srebrenica. As many as 30 to 40 persons per day were dying from military action, starvation, exposure to cold or lack of medical treatment. Resolution 819 attempted to address this issue by declaring Srebrenica a &quot;Safe Area&quot;. Resolution 836 authorized UNPROFOR &quot;acting in self-defense, to take the necessary measures, including the use of force, in reply to bombardments against the safe areas by any of the parties or to armed incursion into them or in the event of any deliberate obstruction in or around those areas to the freedom of movement of UNPROFOR, or of protected humanitarian convoys&quot; . To implement the deterrence, around 7,600 reinforcements were sent and air support was organised in coordination with NATO.

====War in Bosnia====
In May 1993, intense fighting broke out in Central Bosnia between Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats. Croat paramilitary forces committed atrocities against Serbs and Bosnians, such as the massacre in the village of Ahmići, on 16 April 1993. Tihomir Blaškić, an officer of the Croat HVO army formation, was tried and convicted at the ICTY over his responsibility for this massacre. Blaškić served almost nine years in prison before the appeals panel acquitted him of most of the charges in July 2004. The defence proved he did not command all the HVO units in the area or any paramilitary units.

On 24 September, the Security Council was informed by the Croatian Government that if the mandate of UNPROFOR was not amended to promote energetic implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, Croatia would be forced to request UNPROFOR to leave the country no later than 30 November 1993. Subsequent redefinition of the mandate occurred.
At the end of the year, the warring parties attempted to come to a cease-fire. The truce was implemented between Croat and Serb forces, but fighting went on in Bosnia between Bosniaks and Croats, and the humanitarian situation continued to deteriorate. Notably, Sarajevo continued to be bombarded by Bosnian Serb forces. It was also reported that regular Croat army units were supporting Bosnian Croat forces with heavy equipment and men, removing their insignias. This led to further protests from the UN. Use of force began to be discussed at a NATO summit held in Brussels on 10 and 11 January 1994. The Bosnian Serbs, following talks with high-ranking officials of the Russian Federation in Moscow, agreed to open the Tuzla airport for humanitarian purposes. At the same time, the relieving of UN troops in Srebrenica was allowed and the Canadian contingent was replaced by a Dutch contingent.

The situation in Sarajevo, however, remained extremely tense, with Bosnian Serb sniper fire deliberately aimed at civilians, and artillery and heavy mortar fire aimed at population areas. This strongly shaped Western public opinion, as a number of journalists were operating in Sarajevo, and murdered civilians were seen on the evening news on a regular basis. On 4 February 1994, a mortar shell struck a suburb of Sarajevo, killing 10 people and wounding 18. The next day, 5 February 1994, a mortar exploded in Sarajevo&#x27;s Markale market, leaving 68 dead and 200 injured in what was so far the bloodiest incident in Sarajevo in 22 months of fighting. Exasperation at these provocations grew to the point where an ultimatum was sent, requiring the removal or surrender to UNPROFOR of all heavy guns 20 km from Sarajevo (Bosnian and Bosnian Serb, with an exception for Pale) within ten days. The ultimatum was satisfied on 17 February, with the heavy weapons that were not removed being regrouped in seven UNPROFOR-controlled spots.

On 23 February 1994, the cease-fire was brokered between Croat and Bosnian forces – the Washington Agreement – which ended their one-year-long war and united the sides as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. UNPROFOR&#x27;s role in this was to monitor the cease-fire, help rebuild local infrastructure, and staff checkpoints within the federation area.

===March 1994 – November 1994===

====Positive developments and extension of mandate====
On 24 March 1994, a plan for the re-opening of the Tuzla airport, for UNPROFOR and humanitarian use only, was published.

On 29 March 1994, in Zagreb, representatives of the Government of Croatia and the local Serb authorities in UNPAs concluded a cease-fire agreement aiming to achieve a lasting cessation of hostilities.

Concurrently, the mandate of UNPROFOR was extended for another six months, and reinforcements were sent, amounting to 10,000 troops, a few hundred policemen, and observers.

During 1994, UNPROFOR troops in Bosnia came under increased military attacks, resulting in several clashes (Operation Bøllebank, Operation Amanda) with Bosnian Serb forces.

====Assault against safe areas====
Shortly after the cease-fire between Croat and Serb forces, the Bosnian Serbs launched an assault against the Safe area of Goražde, heavily shelling the town and surrounding villages. Protests and exhortations from the UN Security Council turned out to be ineffective, and on 10 and 11 April 1994, NATO launched airstrikes against Bosnian Serb positions. In retaliation, Bosnian Serb forces captured many UN personnel, using them as human shields at sites expected to be bombed. The bombings turned out to be much less effective than the recent Gulf War, which had conditioned the public&#x27;s understanding of airstrikes. In spite of NATO&#x27;s demonstration of air power, and protests of good faith from the Serbs, the shelling continued. In a similar situation to what had happened in Sarajevo, an ultimatum was issued, and by the 24 April, most of the Serb troops had complied. These incidents led to another reflection about the status of the Safe Areas.

====Attempts at peace====
Several Peace Plans had been rejected (the Carrington-Cutiliero plan, the Vance-Owen plan, the &quot;HMS Invincible&quot; package, the Owen-Stoltenburg plan, and the European Union Action Plan). At the end of July, a blueprint was designed by the Contact Group, which consisted of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Russia, and was subsequently accepted by the Croat, Serb and Bosnian parties. The Bosnian Serbs, however, refused to accept the plan. In early August, in an attempt to coerce the Bosnian Serbs into accepting the plan, the Serbian government cut political and economic relationships with the Bosnian Serb leaders - a decision welcomed by the UN Security Council. On 23 September, the UN Security Council officially welcomed the agreement of the warring parties to the peace plan, condemned the Bosnian Serb refusal, and strengthened the sanctions against the Bosnian Serb entity.

====Bosnian Serb Isolation====
On 23 September 1994, in retaliation to the Bosnian Serb obstruction to the Peace Plan, the UN Security Council, adopted Resolution 942, severed all commercial and monetary links to the Bosnian Serb entity. Notably, this cut the flow of fuel to the Bosnian Serbs, which was a critical blow against their strategic military assets.

Due to the extreme position taken by the Bosnian Serb government, the Yugoslav Federation (Serbia and Montenegro) itself had to take a strong stance against the Bosnian Serb entity. This led to the quasi-complete diplomatic isolation of the Bosnian Serb entity.

====Deterioration in security====
In August 1994, the situation deteriorated again, as a result of sniper activity, despite the anti-sniper agreements. Sarajevo&#x27;s &quot;Sniper Alley&quot; became infamous; deliberate attacks against UNPROFOR personnel or aircraft became frequent.

In October, the Bosnian Muslim forces, trapped in the Bihać pocket, attacked the Bosnian Serb forces in an attempt to end the siege of the city. The attack and the ensuing counter-attack by the Bosnian Serbs terrorized the local population, causing another massive exodus of refugees. Bosnian Serb airplanes attacked the Bihać area with cluster bombs and napalm, deliberately violating the &quot;Safe Area&quot; status of Bihać and the &quot;No-flight&quot; zones.

In reaction to this threat, on 21 November, NATO warplanes destroyed the Udbina airstrip, located in the UNPA Sector South in Croatia. The following days, NATO airplanes struck Bosnian Serb anti-air missiles sites that had previously fired upon British jets. NATO also carried out airstrikes against artillery sites which shelled Bihać. Instead of lowering their profile, the Bosnian Serbs retaliated by taking UN personnel hostage and restraining humanitarian aid transit.

On the diplomatic scene, all efforts to reach and implement a cease-fire fell short due to Bosnian Serb obstruction—Dr. Karadžić declined the invitation of the UN Secretary-General.

===United Nations hostages and the Vrbanja bridge===

On 12 March 1995, UNPROFOR made its first request for NATO air support, but close air support was not deployed, owing to a number of delays associated with the approval process. 

On 10 and 11 April 1995, UNPROFOR called in air strikes to protect the Goražde safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two U.S. General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter aircraft. This was the first time in NATO&#x27;s history it had attacked ground targets with aircraft. Subsequently, Bosnian Serbs entered the Gorazde safe area. Serbian Army soldiers took 150 UN personnel hostage on 14 April. A British Sea Harrier was sent to scout the situation and potentially attack Serbian positions, but the Serbs were prepared. On 16 April 1995, a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Bosnian Serb forces.

On 26 May 1995, following NATO air raids on Pale as the Bosnian Serbs defied another UN ultimatum on heavy weapons, around 400 Blue Helmets were taken hostage in different parts of Bosnia, brought to strategic points as human shields, and shown in chains on Serbian TV.

On 27 May 1995, General Mladić along with General Nuhić launched an assault against the UN observation point of the Vrbanja bridge. At 5 in the morning, the French captain commanding the position lost contact with the 12 men and went to investigate. A Serb dressed with a blue helmet, French body armour and uniform attempted to take him hostage, but was deterred by the UN escort, and the officer managed to escape. In the following hours, after intense shelling by ERC 90 Sagaie armoured vehicles, the French stormed the post, killing four Serbs and capturing four others. Two French soldiers were killed and 17 were wounded.

At 12 o&#x27;clock, the Bosnian Serb radio broadcast that General Mladić had ordered to

On the 30 May, Ratko Mladić phoned Rupert Smith and agreed to not place Blue Helmets hostages in chains, but to merely &quot;bring&quot; them to strategic sites. He also demanded apologies for the death of the four Serbian soldiers killed by the French at Vrbanja bridge, threatening to &quot;be unable to guarantee the safety&quot; of the UN forces in Goražde.

===The fall of Srebrenica===
On 12 July 1995 UNPROFOR failed to deter the Bosnian Serb attack on Srebrenica because they were not able to sufficiently reinforce the Dutch battalion in place, and the city was subsequently overrun. When the dual key practices effectively prevented any serious air support from materialising, the Dutch began evacuating women and children. The Serbs held the Muslim men and massacred thousands of them. The safe area of Zepa also fell to Bosnian Serbs on 25 July. The events in Srebrenica led to the Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit (PBPU) report.

NATO initiated &quot;Operation Deliberate Force&quot; on 30 August 1995 in response to further provocations by Serb forces. At this point, UNPROFOR had become &quot;militarily engaged&quot; with NATO against the Bosnian Serb Army. NATO and UNPROFOR were increasingly difficult to separate by autumn 1995, both in terms of policy and actions taken on the ground.

In retaliation for the NATO bombings, the Serbs proceeded to retrieve their confiscated heavy weapons from the UN-controlled concentration points by force. The peace-keepers, massively outnumbered, were forced to surrender after brief, symbolic firefights. In several instances, Blue Helmets were surrounded in weapon storage areas by numerically superior Serbian forces. General Hervé Gobillard, commanding officer for UN troops in Sarajevo, stated that the peacekeepers were &quot;merely limited in their movements, yet [had] arms, ammunition, food for many days, and strict orders to defend their positions&quot;, but in the light of the hostage-takings, concerns were raised and the UN-led bombing stopped. Also, Serbian retaliations against civilians stemming from the bombings caused 70 dead and 150 wounded in Tuzla, and 5 dead in Goražde.

Later, on a winter day, British UN troops carrying sidearms were confronted by General Mladić skiing down the piste at Sarajevo&#x27;s former Olympic skiing resort but made no move for their weapons. Mladić was accompanied by four bodyguards. Despite an active warrant for his arrest issued by the Hague, they decided to carry on skiing. NATO later sent commandos to arrest suspected war criminals, but Mladić went underground. No amount of NATO action or UN demands, or even a $5 million bounty announced by Washington, resulted in his apprehension. However, in May 2011, Mladić was finally arrested and sent to the ICTY.

===Operation Storm and Dayton Agreement===
The above actions and operations by Croat Forces in Krajina during Operation Storm in August 1995 altered the political geography of BiH. Collectively, these ultimately led to the Dayton Agreement and the deployment of the NATO-led IFOR on 20 December 1995 to ensure the adherence of the Former Warring Factions (FWF) to the Military Annexes of The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some of the UNPROFOR troops were folded into the new IFOR forces, but for all intents and purposes, UNPROFOR no longer operated in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Perception in participating countries==

The situation of the field was complex, due to the fact that there were three warring parties, and numerous paramilitary units, responsible for most of the atrocities. These elements were outside of the regular chain of command. Most of the parties used ambiguous tactics to mask their culpability. Their actions included, but were not limited to: 
*The Bosnian Serbs, as part of their &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;, would heavily shell villages while alleging their good faith.
*General Mladić had ordered the shelling of a sector near the Sarajevo airport, while he was on official visit, on the express purposes of appearing heroic in front of the French Blue helmets and to cast doubts as to who was responsible for the bombardment.
*The Bosnian party would take advantage of Safe Areas in order to storm Serb positions or villages.
*In numerous occasions, small groups of one of the warring parties would advance themselves between enemy positions and UN positions, opening fire on UN forces in the hopes of triggering a response from the UN troops.
*In the event of the Srebrenica massacre, which triggered a number of investigations to determine why UN forces failed to deter Serbian forces from storming the town, accusations have been made, notably by General Morillon, that the Serbs actually fell in a propaganda trap used by the Bosnians to reinforce their image of victims and blur their use of Safe Areas as bases. Morillon thought the Serbs&#x27; hatred of the population of Srebrenica had been largely underestimated by all parties, and the massacre could be explained as a loss of control of the Serbian hierarchy over some of its troops. Morillon&#x27;s speculations about &quot;loss of control&quot; were rendered irrelevant by the verdicts of genocide handed down by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. 
Furthermore, the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian civilians by Serbian forces, in an effort to change the demographics, had begun at the start of the war in 1992, in eastern Bosnia.

A great deal of resentment and frustration arose in the participating countries, especially in those whose troops had been in contact with the most dramatic situations, for instance (and not exclusively): 
*The involvement of the British battalion, especially concerning the Ahmići massacre, inspired the TV series &quot;Warriors&quot; by the BBC.
*The involvement of the Dutch battalion (DutchBat) in Srebrenica inspired &quot;The Enclave&quot;.
*The involvement of the Canadian battalion (CanBat) in Krajina inspiredthe film &quot;The Peacekeepers&quot;.
*The general situation in Sarajevo inspired the 1995 comic &quot;Sarajevo Tango&quot;, by Hermann. 
*The attack against French Blue Helmets by Serb forces disguised as French U.N. troops on the bridge of Vrbanja.
*Bosnian Serb forces, in the process of retrieving their heavy weapons from UN-controlled collection points by force, took UN peacekeeping personnel hostage. 
*Particularly dramatic and sensational episodes, such as the &quot;Sarajevo&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet&quot;, inevitable in any conflict, but abundantly mediatised. The &quot;Sarajevo&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet&quot; incident inspired the documentary &quot;Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo&quot;.
*In French, the word &quot;sniper&quot; entered common vocabulary after the phrase &quot;Sniper Alley&quot; became famous. It supplanted the usual words &quot;tireur d&#x27;élite&quot;, &quot;tireur embusqué&quot; or &quot;franc-tireur&quot;.

<text>Non-philosophy () is a concept popularized by French philosopher François Laruelle.

==Precursors==
German philosopher Adam Karl August von Eschenmayer developed an early approach to philosophy called non-philosophy (). He defined it as a kind of mystical illumination by which was obtained a belief in God that could not be reached by mere intellectual effort. He carried this tendency to mysticism into his physical researches, and was led by it to take a deep interest in the phenomena of animal magnetism. He ultimately became a devout believer in demoniacal and spiritual possession; and his later writings are all strongly impregnated with supernaturalism. Laruelle sees Eschenmayer&#x27;s doctrine as a &quot;break with philosophy and its systematic aspect in the name of passion, faith, and feeling&quot;.

Japanese Kyoto school philosopher Hajime Tanabe advanced another early notion on non-philosophy in his 1945 tome &quot;Philosophy as Metanoetics&quot;. Drawing on his earlier studies of Western philosophy, Hajime took inspiration from Shin Buddhism to conceive of &quot;a philosophy that is not a philosophy&quot; in which the limitations of speculative reason would be recognized and transcended, avoiding both idealism and materialism. Hajime emphasized this non-philosophy (&quot;metanoetics&quot;) as defined not by the &quot;self-power&quot; of the philosopher but by a mediating &quot;Other-power&quot; (or &quot;absolute nothingness&quot;) through which philosophizing could be newly possible.

==Non-philosophy according to Laruelle==
Laruelle argues that all forms of philosophy (from ancient philosophy to analytic philosophy to deconstruction and so on) are structured around a prior decision, and remain constitutively blind to this decision. The &#x27;decision&#x27; that Laruelle is concerned with here is the dialectical splitting of the world in order to grasp the world philosophically. Examples from the history of philosophy include Immanuel Kant&#x27;s distinction between the synthesis of manifold impressions and the faculties of the understanding; Martin Heidegger&#x27;s split between the ontic and the ontological; and Jacques Derrida&#x27;s notion of différance/presence. The reason Laruelle finds this decision interesting and problematic is because the decision itself cannot be grasped (philosophically grasped, that is) without introducing some further scission.

Laruelle further argues that the decisional structure of philosophy can only be grasped non-philosophically. In this sense, non-philosophy is a science of philosophy. Non-philosophy is not metaphilosophy because, as Laruelle scholar Ray Brassier notes, &quot;philosophy is already metaphilosophical through its constitutive reflexivity&quot;. Brassier also defines non-philosophy as the &quot;theoretical practice of philosophy proceeding by way of transcendental axioms and producing theorems which are philosophically uninterpretable&quot;. The reason why the axioms and theorems of non-philosophy are philosophically uninterpretable is because, as explained, philosophy cannot grasp its decisional structure in the way that non-philosophy can.

Laruelle&#x27;s non-philosophy, he claims, should be considered to philosophy what non-Euclidean geometry is to the work of Euclid. It stands in particular opposition to philosophical heirs of Jacques Lacan such as Alain Badiou.

Laruelle scholar Ekin Erkan, elucidating on Laruelle&#x27;s system, notes that &quot;&#x27;non-philosophy&#x27; [...] withdraws from the metaphysical precept of separating the world into binarisms, perhaps epitomized by the formative division between &#x27;universals” and “particulars&#x27; in Kant’s Transcendental Deduction. Laruelle’s method also rejects the &#x27;evental&#x27; nature of Being described by Heiddegger [...] Laruelle&#x27;s &#x27;One&#x27; is understood as generic identity - an identity/commonality that reverses the classical metaphysics found in philosophy’s bastion thinkers (a lineage that runs from Plato to Badiou), where the transcendental is upheld as a necessary precondition for grounding reality.&quot;&quot;

===Role of the subject===
The decisional structure of philosophy is grasped by the subject of non-philosophy. Laruelle&#x27;s concept of &quot;the subject&quot; here is not the same as the subject-matter, nor does it have anything to do with the traditional philosophical notion of subjectivity. It is, instead, a function along the same lines as a mathematical function.

The concept of performativity (taken from speech act theory) is central to the idea of the subject of non-philosophy. Laruelle believes that both philosophy and non-philosophy are performative. However, philosophy merely performatively legitimates the decisional structure which, as already noted, it is unable to fully grasp, in contrast to non-philosophy which collapses the distinction (present in philosophy) between theory and action. In this sense, non-philosophy is radically performative because the theorems deployed in accordance with its method constitute fully-fledged scientific actions. Non-philosophy, then, is conceived as a rigorous and scholarly discipline.

The role of the subject is a critical facet of Laruelle&#x27;s non-ethics and Laruelle&#x27;s political system. &quot;By problematizing what he terms &#x27;The Statist Ideal,&#x27; or the &#x27;Unitary Illusion&#x27; - be it negative (Hegel) or positive (Nietzsche) - Laruelle interrogates the &#x27;scission&#x27; of the minority subject, which he contends is a “symptom” of the Western dialectic practice. In opposition to the Kantian first principles upon which both Continental and Analytic philosophy rest, Laruelle attempts to sketch a &#x27;real Critique of Reason&#x27; that is determined in itself and through itself; insofar as this involves Laruellean &#x27;non-ethics,&#x27; this involves breaking from the long-situated practice of studying the State from the paralogism of the State view, itself.&quot;

===Radical immanence===
The radically performative character of the subject of non-philosophy would be meaningless without the concept of radical immanence. The philosophical doctrine of immanence is generally defined as any philosophical belief or argument which resists transcendent separation between the world and some other principle or force (such as a creator deity). According to Laruelle, the decisional character of philosophy makes immanence impossible for it, as some ungraspable splitting is always taking place within. By contrast, non-philosophy axiomatically deploys immanence as being endlessly conceptualizable by the subject of non-philosophy. This is what Laruelle means by &quot;radical immanence&quot;. The actual work of the subject of non-philosophy is to apply its methods to the decisional resistance to radical immanence which is found in philosophy.

=== &quot;Sans-philosophie&quot; ===
In &quot;A New Presentation of Non-Philosophy&quot; (2004), François Laruelle states:


Numbered amongst the early members or sympathizers of &quot;sans-philosophie&quot; (&quot;without philosophy&quot;) are those included in a collection published in 2005 by L’Harmattan: François Laruelle, Jason Barker, Ray Brassier, Laurent Carraz, Hugues Choplin, Jacques Colette, Nathalie Depraz, Oliver Feltham, Gilles Grelet, Jean-Pierre Faye, Gilbert Hottois, Jean-Luc Rannou, Pierre A. Riffard, Sandrine Roux and Jordanco Sekulovski. Since then, a slew of translations and new introductions have appeared from John Ó Maoilearca (Mullarkey), Anthony Paul Smith, Rocco Gangle, Katerina Kolozova, and Alexander Galloway.
