<text>Theophilus Shickel Painter (August 22, 1889 – October 5, 1969) was an American zoologist best known for his work on the structure and function of chromosomes, especially the sex-determination genes X and Y in humans. He was the first to discover that human sex was determined by an X/Y heteromorphic chromosomal pair mechanism.
He also carried out work in identifying genes in fruit flies (&quot;Drosophila&quot;). His work exploited the giant polytene chromosomes in the salivary glands of &quot;Drosophila&quot; and other Dipteran larvae. Painter was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1938 and the American Philosophical Society in 1939.

==Academic administration==
Painter joined the faculty at the University of Texas in 1916 and, except for military duty during World War I, stayed there his whole career. He was, in succession, associate professor, professor and distinguished professor of zoology. He served as acting president (1944–1946) and president (1946–1952) of the University of Texas and retired from active teaching in 1966.

==Racial segregation==
Painter was president of the University of Texas when Texas resident Heman Marion Sweatt applied for and was denied admission due to his race. Painter spoke out against integration, and voiced his disapproval of Sweatt&#x27;s admittance. &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, 339 U.S.629 (1950), which proved an integral stepping stone in the landmark case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot; that held that &quot;separate is inherently unequal&quot; and led to the integration of America&#x27;s public schools.

==Gender research==
Painter is also known for his early study of human chromosomes. In a paper published in 1923, he first gave the number 24 for the count of human meiotic chromosomes. He had tried to count the tangled mass of chromosomes he could see under a microscope in spermatocytes in slices of testicle and arrived at the figure of 24. Others later repeated his experiment in other ways and agreed upon the number of 24. Popular thinking held that if there were 24 chromosomes in spermatocytes, there must be an equal number contributed by the female and the human chromosome number must be 48, which was undisputed for more than 30 years. Then in 1955, Joe Hin Tjio and Albert Levan, using more advanced techniques, looked at the chromosomes in human somatic cells and found 46 chromosomes and the human chromosome number was finally revised.

In 1934 Painter was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.

<text>Chaka Fattah (born Arthur Wesley Davenport; November 21, 1956) is an American politician who served as a Democratic member of the U.S. House for from 1995 to 2016. The district included portions of North Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia along with Lower Merion Township in Montgomery County. He previously served in the Pennsylvania Senate and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

On July 29, 2015, Fattah and a group of associates were indicted on federal charges related to their alleged roles in a racketeering and influence peddling conspiracy. He was convicted on 23 counts of racketeering, fraud, and other corruption charges on June 21, 2016, and resigned two days later. On December 12, 2016, Fattah was sentenced to 10 years in prison. On August 9, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia overturned Fattah&#x27;s bribery convictions. On July 12, 2019, a Philadelphia judge sentenced Fattah to 10 years in federal prison for public corruption. He was released from prison in the summer of 2020.

==Early life and education==
Arthur Davenport was born and raised in Philadelphia, to Russell and Frances Davenport as the fourth of six sons. His father was a sergeant in the United States Army and his mother was an editor for the &quot;Philadelphia Tribune&quot;. His parents divorced when he was young, and his mother soon remarried to a man she met at a national conference on black power in 1968. Following this conference, his mother and her new husband decided to change their family name to Fattah. They would change Arthur&#x27;s name to Chaka, after a Zulu king. His mother and stepfather&#x27;s social activism strongly influenced Fattah&#x27;s political development.

His adoptive father, David Fattah, and mother, Falaka Fattah (born Frances Brown, also known as &quot;Queen Mother&quot; Falaka Fattah), are community activists in West Philadelphia, where they are building an &quot;urban Boys&#x27; Town&quot; through their organization, the House of Umoja. He has five brothers.

Fattah attended Overbrook High School and the Community College of Philadelphia. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in business and economics from the University of Pennsylvania. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 1984, Fattah completed the Program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government. In May 1986, he received his master&#x27;s degree in governmental administration from the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Fels Institute of Government.

Fattah was the recipient of numerous honors and awards including 10 honorary doctorates and the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Fels Institute of Government Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Fattah one of the 50 most promising leaders in the country.

==Pennsylvania State Legislature==
Fattah served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 192nd district from 1983 to 1988, and as a State Senator for the 7th district from 1988 to 1994.

In 1987, Fattah founded the Graduate Opportunity Initiative Conference, an annual three-day informational and scholarship conference which aims to significantly increase the enrollment of under-represented graduate students studying Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM fields). The conference was designed to encourage minority students’ interest in STEM graduate and professional schools.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1991, State Senator Fattah decided to run for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the special election that was held after Democratic U.S. Congressman William Gray decided to resign. On November 5, 1991, City Councilman Lucien Edward Blackwell won the election with a plurality of 39% of the vote defeating Fattah (28%), John F. White (28%), and Nadine Smith-Bulford (5%).

In 1994, Fattah decided to challenge Blackwell in the Democratic primary. He defeated the incumbent 58%–42%. He won the general election with 86% of the vote. After that, he was re-elected every two years with at least 86% of the vote. He was never challenged in the Democratic primary until 2016, when he lost to Dwight E. Evans.

===Tenure===
Fattah represented the 2nd district in Pennsylvania, an overwhelmingly Democratic district, in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2016. Fattah endorsed Barack Obama for president in 2008.

====GEAR Up and education====

He is the architect of the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs.

In his first years in the U.S. House of Representatives, Fattah introduced and passed into law Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), a college awareness and preparedness program. Since its inception, more than $4 billion in federal funds have been distributed to assist 12million students in 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Fattah sponsored H.R. 4207, American Dream Accounts Act which would authorize the Department of Education to award three-year competitive grants to support partnerships that provide financial support and preparation for low-income students as they plan for their college education. The bill is co-sponsored in the U. S. Senate by Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. Specifically the legislation creates personal online accounts for students that monitor higher education readiness and includes a college savings account. The accounts follow students from school to school and through college. Parents can grant vested stakeholders (including counselors, teachers, coaches, mentors, and others) access to the account to update student information, monitor progress, and provide college preparatory support.

Fattah has introduced a few bills targeting the equity of resource allocation within and between school districts. In 2002, he introduced the &quot;Student Bill of Rights&quot;, H.R. 2451. The measure calls for States to provide highly effective teachers, early childhood education, college prep curricula and equitable instructional resources to all students who attend public schools. Current law requires that schools within the same district provide comparable educational services; this bill would extend that basic protection to the State level by requiring comparability across school districts.
 
The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act, H.R. 5071 – amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to requires school districts to equalize the real dollars spent among all schools within its jurisdiction – with the imperative to raise the resources allotted to schools in the poorest neighborhoods to meet those in well-off schools – before receiving federal aid.

Fattah introduced &quot;Communities Committed to College&quot;, H.R. 1579. The legislation provides a 50% tax credit to donors who contribute to qualifying scholarship trusts that are recognized and registered with the Secretary of the Treasury. 
He also wrote the legislation for the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). The tax credit assists any full-time college or university student or their families that claim the credit. Since 2011, it has assisted 4.5million students and their families. AOTC provides up to $2500 tax credit for families to assist them with the cost of college. The credit is unique in that families under a set income without a tax liability are eligible for a tax rebate. President Obama has called for making the tax credit permanent.
Outside of legislative work Fattah has created a few local education initiatives for Philadelphia and Pennsylvania families as a state legislator and in cooperation with state and municipal governments, including the CORE scholars program and the annual Grad Conference.

College Opportunity Resources for Education (CORE) is an initiative providing almost $27 million in last-dollar scholarships to over 18,000 students. The program encourages the students to participate in service to the local community and provides technical assistance to the families of program participants ensuring that they apply for educational assistance programs (Pell Grants, PHEAA grants, etc.) offered by the state and federal government.
A report issued by the National Student Clearinghouse concludes that participants in CORE are more likely than their fellow non-CORE classmates to complete their college education in four years.

====Youth mentoring====
Fattah was the lead Democrat responsible for the funding of the United States Department of Justice and the United States Attorney General. Since 2011, the Congressman was able to negotiate an increase of $30M to investment in DOJ programs that fund groups including the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.

In 2012, Fattah negotiated a partnership between FIRST and Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America to provide robotics programs to 4million youth by 2015.

====Neuroscience====
Fattah was the lead Democrat responsible for funding some of the largest science agencies in the federal system (NASA, NSF, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). In December 2011, Fattah through his role on the Appropriations Committee, directed the OSTP to establish an Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience (IWGN). Housed within the White House and chartered on June 20, 2012, the IWGN convenes representatives across the Federal government to make recommendations about the future of neuroscience research.
 
The Fattah Neuroscience Initiative is a policy initiative designed to make major progress understanding the human brain by intensifying, in a collaborative fashion, federal research efforts across brain disease, disorder, injury, cognition and development. The initiative aims to coordinate Federal research across agencies and draw upon public-private partnerships and the world of academia. The initiative promotes research and discovery across brain cognition, development, disease and injury.

====Manufacturing====
Fattah states that his priority is ensuring that small and medium businesses have the tools they need to prosper in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. He is the lead Democrat responsible for funding the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. In his role on the Appropriations Committee, Fattah has advocated to $128 million in funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a program that assists small and mid-sized manufacturers create and retain jobs, increase profits, and save time and money. He is also an advocate for the SelectUSA program, an initiative that encourages U.S. businesses operating off-shore to return to the U.S. and promote the U.S. marketplace.

====Cooperative development====
Fattah was considered a “true champion” of the co-op movement by the American Co-op Association.

In May 2013, Fattah introduced the Creating Jobs through Cooperatives Act (HR 2437). This legislation will provide means to catalyze cooperative development, provide tools to entrepreneurs to bring cooperative to their communities, partner with financial institutions to provide grants a loans to developing businesses, offer technical training and professional development. His bill calls for $25million federal investment and technical assistance to cooperatives through a new National Cooperative Development Center. The bill has national support from co-op and EOB advocates and members. Co-ops have a broad base and connection to community in the Philadelphia area.

In November 2013, Fattah was invited to attend as Keynote speaker at the Annual Cooperatives Conference, hosted by the NCBA. The conference brought together national leaders in cooperative development to share best practices to create powerful change for their organizations.

===Sponsored legislation===
As a member of Pennsylvania&#x27;s state House Fattah wrote and passed into law Pennsylvania&#x27;s Homeowners Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program (HEMAP). HEMAP is a loan program designed to protect Pennsylvanians who, through no fault of their own, are financially unable to make their mortgage payments and are in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. Started in 1983 by Pennsylvania&#x27;s Act 91 of 1983, it was only one of its kind until 2010 when Fattah added language to the Dodd Frank bill to provide similar assistance, to homeowners nationwide. The Emergency Homeowners Loan Program provides up to 24 months of assistance, through bridge loans, for distressed homeowners and is a scaled-up version of the HEMAP program.

In 2013, Fattah served as a vice chair on the House Gun and Violence Taskforce, a taskforce created under the direction of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. The taskforce included both liberal and conservative Democrats, gun owners and Representatives from various cities. Fattah received an F rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund and an A+ rating from the Coalition on Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence for his positions on gun control.

Since 2006, Fattah has &quot;pioneered gun-buyback programs&quot; in Philadelphia with the Philadelphia Police. The program offers Philadelphians the chance to exchange firearms for vouchers for groceries or other goods.

In 2004, Fattah introduced a bill titled the &quot;Transform America Transaction Fee&quot;, (H.R. 3759) which proposed to have the U.S. Treasury conduct a one-year feasibility study of a 1 percent transaction fee imposed on transactions made at any financial institution. He touted the possibility that such a system would bring in so much money it would allow for greatly increased federal spending, saying the &quot;excess funds&quot; would &quot;provide universal health care, support an equitable public school finance system, and fund economic development in urban and rural areas&quot;, in addition to extinguishing the national debt and eliminating all other federal taxes. The bill died without attracting any co-sponsor. In 2005, Fattah introduced the bill again with H.R. 1601, and again in 2007 with H.R. 2130 which had a single cosponsor, Democratic Rep. Brian Baird of Washington. Both bills died without any action being taken. In 2009, Fattah introduced a fourth bill to require having a study conducted, H.R. 1703, which attracted no cosponsors. On February 23, 2010, Fattah reintroduced the bill as the &quot;Debt Free America Act&quot;, (H.R. 4646) which proposed to repeal the federal income tax and replace it with a 1 percent &quot;transaction tax&quot; on every financial transaction – whether paid by cash, credit card or any form of financial transfer, the only exception being transactions involving the purchase or sale of stock. The latest bill places more focus on eliminating the federal debt. Fattah has also added a 1 percent tax credit designed to eliminate the impact of the measure on couples making less than $250,000 a year. As of September 5, 2010, none of the House committees have scheduled any action on the latest bill.

In 2005, Fattah opposed the War in Iraq and supported Congressman John Murtha&#x27;s call for troop withdrawal. He publicly supported the &quot;Bring Our Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Act&quot; a bill that called for bringing the troops home within six months and transitioning the Iraqis to self-government.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development

== Later career ==

=== 2007 mayoral election ===
In November 2006, he declared his candidacy for Mayor of Philadelphia, where two-term incumbent Mayor John F. Street was barred from re-election by term limits, amid pressure from Democratic voters to keep his Congressional seat to maintain a Philadelphia representative on the powerful Appropriations Committee in the House. His candidacy announcement took place next to the recently completed Microsoft School of the Future in the city&#x27;s Parkside neighborhood to emphasize his campaign platform of better educational opportunities for city youth.

After emerging as a mayoral candidate, Fattah came under fire from the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police for his repeated calls to grant a new trial to Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of murdering police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981; he also was criticized for possibly unethical campaign spending, based on new campaign finance rules adopted by the city of Philadelphia. The Fattah campaign defended itself, claiming that it had followed less restrictive federal rules in spending the money, but eventually returned a portion of the excess contributions to the exploratory committee following a settlement with the city&#x27;s Board of Ethics. Fattah eventually came in fourth in the Democratic primary, close behind fellow Congressman Bob Brady but well behind former city councilman Michael Nutter, who went on to win the fall general election handily.

===2016 indictment and conviction===

In August 2014, Fattah&#x27;s longtime aide and close confidant Gregory Naylor pled guilty to federal charges in a complex money laundering scheme used to hide an illegal million-dollar loan that a candidate, unnamed in that indictment, received for his failed mayoral campaign in 2007. The loan was paid back using federal grant money intended for nonprofit organizations affiliated with Fattah. A subsequent Philadelphia Daily News investigation revealed that nonprofits receiving federal funding and connected to Fattah paid out over $5.8 million to Fattah allies and alleged that many of these payments were ethically dubious.

On July 29, 2015, Fattah and four of his associates, Bonnie Bowser, Karen Nicholas, Herbert Verderman and Robert Brand were indicted for their alleged roles in a racketeering conspiracy involving several schemes that were intended to further the political and financial interests of the defendants and others by, among other tactics, misappropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars of federal, charitable and campaign funds. The FBI further alleged that Fattah accepted an $18,000 bribe from a man seeking an ambassadorship.

The trial was originally scheduled for May 2, 2016, but in April a judge had the date pushed back to May 16 to give the defendants time to review the excess of more than 100,000 documents accrued by the prosecution.

On June 21, 2016, Fattah was convicted of all charges, including racketeering conspiracy, bribery, bank fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements to a financial institution, and falsification of records. Initially, he stated he would not leave office until October when he was due to be sentenced, but subsequently announced his immediate resignation from Congress two days later on June 23. Just days later, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in &quot;McDonnell v. United States&quot; which altered the legal definition of bribery to exclude &quot;pay for access&quot;. On the basis of this ruling, Fattah appealed his conviction in October 2016, placing his sentencing on hold.

On December 12, 2016, Fattah was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He reported for prison at Federal Correctional Institution, McKean near Lewis Run, Pennsylvania on January 25, 2017.

On August 9, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia overturned Fattah&#x27;s bribery convictions.

The Court of Appeals remanded for a new trial as to certain bribery and money laundering counts, concluding that the jury had not been properly instructed regarding &quot;official acts&quot; in a bribery context.  (The government thereafter announced its intention not to retry those counts.)  With regard to the government&#x27;s cross-appeal, the Court of Appeals reinstated certain counts that had been dismissed by the District Court post-trial. The case was then remanded for resentencing.  

For these additional counts, Fattah was again sentenced to 10 years of incarceration on July 12, 2019.

Fattah was released from prison on June 8, 2020.

===Fattah Neuroscience Global Advisors===
In December 2016, Fattah founded the consulting firm, Fattah Neuroscience Global Advisors (FNGA). FNGA&#x27;s mission is to work with universities, non-profits and private corporations to advance brain science and research throughout the globe. According to Fattah, he founded FNGA because &quot;I still have to provide for my family. I could just go give speeches, but talking about things is different than going out and doing them.&quot; Fattah, who is the longest serving African-American in Congress from Pennsylvania and the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, was known for having a particular legislative focus on advancing neuroscience research. He served as the Ranking Member of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. Fattah championed the Fattah Neuroscience Initiative, a component of H.R. 933, which directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to &quot;work with all relevant stakeholders to consider how incentives could hasten the development of new prevention and treatment options for neurological diseases and disorders, and to recommend options for such incentives.&quot;

FNGA announced a five-year partnership with the Brain Wellness Initiative of Africa in January 2022. Together, the two organizations will work to improve and advance brain research on the continent of Africa. In addition, they aim to advance the research of African brain scientists throughout the globe. Since 2021, FNGA has hosted virtual forums on brain research.

Fattah also serves as Chairman of the National Brain Council, an advocacy project with the goal of increasing federal funding towards brain research by 100%.

<text>Jimmie Randolph Hall (born March 17, 1938) is an American former Major League Baseball outfielder and left-handed batter who played eight seasons in the big leagues. A two-time All-Star, Hall made his debut with the Minnesota Twins (1963–66), followed by stints with the California Angels (1967–68), Cleveland Indians (1968–69), New York Yankees (1969), Chicago Cubs (1969–70) and Atlanta Braves (1970).

== Early life ==
Hall was born on March 17, 1938, in Mount Holly, North Carolina. At six years old, he was doing farmwork behind a plough. He was a star baseball player at Belmont High School, and in American Legion baseball under coach Lawrence &quot;Crash&quot; Davis. In 1954, his American Legion team was runner up in the American Legion World Series. His father, James Hall, convinced Hall to pursue a baseball career. 

==Baseball career==
===Minor league===
Hall was signed as an amateur free agent by the Washington Senators on June 21, 1956 following his high school graduation, who had outbid the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, and Pittsburgh Pirates for Hall&#x27;s services. After signing, Hall was assigned to the Superior Senators in the D-level Nebraska State League where he made an immediate impression-hitting .385 with 15 home runs, 6 triples, and 11 doubles in only 58 games. However, he would fail to build on, or even equal, this level of production at the plate and would languish for the next six full seasons in the minors before seeing the major leagues. 

Promoted to the Kinston Eagles in the B-level Carolina League in 1957 on the strength of his debut season, Hall would regress in his sophomore season and only hit .233 with 6 home runs in 133 games. Forced to repeat the same level in 1958, Hall regained some of his power stroke, belting 17 home runs and 14 doubles to go along with a .267 batting average in 75 games for the Fox Cities Foxes in the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League before being promoted to Single-A Charlotte Hornets in the South Atlantic League for the final 9 games of their season.

In 1959, Hall was promoted to the AA Southern Association and spent the entire seasons with the Chattanooga Lookouts. However, he continued to be unimpressive at the plate, hitting .245 with 11 home runs and 57 runs batted in (RBI) in 133 games. Hall also was given an extended tryout at shortstop (with the Senators typically only having all-field, no-hit options on the major league roster), but he would struggle in the field at this new position and commit 24 errors in only 78 games. Although Hall would be promoted to the AAA Charleston Senators in 1960, he would hit only .227 with 9 home runs and 30 RBI in 110 games, in which he would see double digit starts at second, third, shortstop, and the outfield. The 1961 and 1962 seasons saw Hall appear in only 54 total games spread over three AAA teams, the Syracuse Chiefs, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Vancouver Mounties, hitting a combined .232. The only bright spot would be that the Senators gave up trying to convert Hall into a utility infielder and he saw all his playing time in the outfield. Maybe coincidentally, Hall would hit .313 with 3 home runs and 18 RBI in 24 games with Vancouver in 1962.

===Major league===
====1963====
After not spending a day in the major leagues, Hall went north with the Twins in 1963 as a reserve outfielder behind future Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew in left field, All-Star and former Rookie of the Year Bob Allison in right, and veteran Lenny Green in center. Hall would get off to an inauspicious start, hitting only .185 through the first 48 games, but a mid-June injury to Green would give Hall the chance to showcase himself for an extended period of time and he never looked back. Hall started 125 games of the 143 games he played in, ultimately replacing Green.

Starting on June 8, Hall would be the starting centerfielder and he&#x27;d sparkle, hitting .276 with 31 of his 33 home runs, 72 of his 80 RBI, and 72 of his 88 runs over the Twins&#x27; final 116 games. Hall&#x27;s home run total would set a career high, rank fourth in the AL in 1963 (and stood for more than 50 years as the AL record for home runs by a first-year player with not even a game of prior major league experience until broken by Jose Abreu in 2014), topping Ted Williams&#x27; 31 homers in 1939. He is one of only two players in the modern era of major league baseball history, along with Dodgers outfielder Joc Pederson (2015), to have two streaks of home runs in four consecutive games or more in their rookie season.

At the end of the season, he would finish third in the Rookie of the Year voting behind a pair of Chicago White Sox, third baseman Pete Ward and starting pitcher Gary Peters. Hall&#x27;s breakout rookie season was more than enough for him to supplant Green as the Twins&#x27; center fielder going forward and Green would be traded early in the 1964 season to the Los Angeles Angels as part of a three-team trade with the Baltimore Orioles with the Twins receiving utilityman Frank Kostro and infielder Jerry Kindall in return.

====1964====
Handed the center fielder job to start the 1964 season, Hall had a decent sophomore season but did not quite reproduce his 1963 production. Although he would raise his batting average to .282, his power would fall off somewhat with a 24% drop in home runs (from 33 to 25) and a 40% drop in triples (5 to 3). The Twins would also see a drop off, going from a 91 win, third-place finish in 1963 to 79 wins and sixth in the 10-team AL. However, Hall would be named to his first All-Star game in 1964, along with teammates Killebrew, Allison, Tony Oliva, and Camilo Pascual, and would be a 9th inning defensive replacement for the AL starter in centerfield, Mickey Mantle. On May 2, 1964, Minnesota became the third club in the MLB history to hit four consecutive home runs in the same inning, as Oliva, Allison, Hall, and Killebrew all connected in the top of the 11th inning in a 3–3 tie game. With 3 home runs off Kansas City Athletics reliever Dan Pfister and Killebrew&#x27;s off his replacement, Vern Handrahan, the Twins would pull out a 7–3 victory. 

On May 27 versus the Los Angeles Angels, he led off the fifth inning and was hit on the cheek by a pitch from fire-balling southpaw Bo Belinsky. Hall immediately exited the game, but returned to the starting lineup about a week later and then played well for the remainder of the season while wearing a special protective flap on his batting helmet. However, this beaning and his already feeble showing against left-handed pitchers - hitting .187 with only 4 of his 121 career home runs off them - contributed to his being timid and ineffective versus southpaws, and could contribute to why he ended up finished as a productive player by his sixth season. This theory has been called into question. In 1963, before the beaning, he hit .235 with one home run in 68 at-bats against left-handed pitching, while hitting .263 with 32 home runs against right-handers. In the year after Belinsky hit him, 1965, Hall had a .240 average against lefthanders with one home run in 96 at-bats, while hitting .296 with 19 home runs against right handers. In 1966 and 1967, his average against left-handers fell to .163 and .098 respectively, with only 1 home run combined in 84 total at-bats those two years.

====1965====
Hall was almost traded to the Mets before the 1965 season, but the deal fell through. His 1965 would basically be a carbon copy of the previous season and would see him hit career highs in average (.285), RBI (86), doubles (25), and stolen bases (14), but would also see another drop in home runs to 20. Showcasing both his power and speed, Hall not only hit 20 home runs in 1965 but also beat out 20 infield singles. He would be named to his last all-star team in the July 13 game that was played at Minnesota&#x27;s Metropolitan Stadium, along with five fellow Twins (first baseman Harmon Killebrew, catcher Earl Battey, pitcher Mudcat Grant, shortstop Zoilo Versalles and Tony Oliva), and went hitless with a walk and a run in two plate appearances after pinch hitting for pitcher Pete Richert in the bottom of the fifth inning and moving over to center field in place of starter Vic Davalillo to begin the sixth. Hall&#x27;s struggles against lefties in 1965 (a .240 batting average) continued in that year&#x27;s World Series against the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers. With five of the seven games started by southpaws Sandy Koufax, the 1965 Cy Young Award winner, and Claude Osteen, Hall would only play in the two games started by right hander Don Drysdale (in which he would strike out five times with one hit and one walk in 7 plate appearances). With no help from Hall&#x27;s righthanded substitute the Twins would lose the Series four games to three.

====1966====
Hall would see a big drop in playing time in 1966 (from 148 games to 120) as the Twins would more often sit him against tough lefties. Rookie left hander Ted Uhlaender would be given significant playing time in center as Hall would play all three outfield positions, with most of his time being in left in place of ailing slugger Allison. With reduced playing time, Hall saw an across-the-board drop in all statistical categories, hitting only .239 with 20 home runs, 47 RBI, and 7 doubles (falling off a cliff from 1965&#x27;s 25 doubles), but would still slug at least 20 home runs for the fourth season in a row. Deciding to employ the light-hitting Uhlaender full-time in center, the Twins traded Hall on December 2 to the Angels along with reliever Pete Cimino and first baseman Don Mincher for starter Dean Chance and a player to be named (which would become infielder Jackie Hernandez on April 10, 1967).

====1967====
Employed similarly in 1967, Hall would share time in a lefty/righty platoon with Bubba Morton, getting only 41 at-bats against left handers in 129 games (hitting a pathetic .098 with one extra base hit), and would put up similar numbers to 1966 (.249, 16 HRs and 55 RBI) and reaching double figures in home runs for the fifth consecutive season. However, he would be finished as a full-time player.

====1968====
Hall was batting .214 with one homer and eight RBI in 46 games when he was traded from the Angels to the Cleveland Indians for Vic Davalillo before the trade deadline on June 15, 1968. The change of scenery would not help Hall as he would hit only .198 in 53 games.

====1969====
Hall started 1969 with the Indians but ended up with the New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs before the season was out.

====1970====
Hall started 1970 with the Cubs but ended it with the Atlanta Braves. He retired after the 1970 season.

====Career totals====
In eight seasons, Hall batted .254 with 121 home runs, 391 RBI, 387 runs, 100 doubles, 24 triples, 38 stolen bases and 287 walks in 963 games. Defensively, Hall recorded a .981 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions and first base.

==Personal life==
During the 1967-68 offseason, Hall worked as a furniture salesman in Denver, North Carolina. and as a sports announcer at radio station WCGC. He had a sports talk radio show, and called the play-by-play for Gaston College&#x27;s basketball games. After retiring, he worked for Carolina Freight.

In 2008, Hall was inducted into the Gaston County Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Scott O&#x27;Dell (May 23, 1898 – October 15, 1989) was an American writer of 26 novels for young people, along with three novels for adults and four nonfiction books. He wrote historical fiction, primarily, including several children&#x27;s novels about historical California and Mexico. For his contribution as a children&#x27;s writer he received the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1972, the highest recognition available to creators of children&#x27;s books. He received The University of Southern Mississippi Medallion in 1976 and the Catholic Libraries Association Regina Medal in 1978.

O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s best known work is the historical novel &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; (1960), which won the 1961 Newbery Medal and the 1963 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in its German translation. It was also named to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list. He was one of the annual Newbery runners-up for three other books: &quot;The King&#x27;s Fifth&quot; (1966), &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; (1967), and &quot;Sing Down the Moon&quot; (1970).
Scott O&#x27;Dell was born on May 23,1898 as &quot;O&#x27;Dell Gabriel Scott&quot;&quot;&#x27;, but after his name was incorrectly published on a book as &quot;Scott O&#x27;Dell&quot;, he decided to keep the name. He was born on Terminal Island in Los Angeles, California, to parents May Elizabeth Gabriel and Bennett Mason Scott. He attended multiple colleges, including Occidental College in 1919, the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1920, Stanford University in 1921, and the Sapienza University of Rome in 1925. During World War II, he served in the United States Army Air Forces. Before becoming a full-time writer, he was employed as a cameraman and technical director, as a book columnist for the &quot;Los Angeles Mirror&quot;, and as book review editor for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;. He was married two times. His wives were Jane Dorsa Rattenbury, and Elizabeth Hall.

In 1934, O&#x27;Dell began writing articles as well as fiction and nonfiction books for adults. In the late 1950s, he began writing children&#x27;s books. His first children&#x27;s book was &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot;.

In 1984, he established the Scott O&#x27;Dell Award for Historical Fiction, an award of $5,000 that recognizes outstanding works of historical fiction. The winners must be published in English by a U.S. publisher and be set in the New World (North, Central, and South America). In 1986, &quot;The Bulletin of the Center for Children&#x27;s Books&quot; awarded O&#x27;Dell this same award.

Scott O&#x27;Dell died of prostate cancer on October 15, 1989, at the age of 91. His ashes were sprinkled into the Pacific Ocean off La Jolla.

==Film adaptations==
There have been several film adaptations of O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s work. &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; has been translated into a number of languages and was made into a movie in 1964, starring Celia Kaye, Larry Domasin, Ann Daniel, and George Kennedy. In 1978, Saul Swimmer produced and directed a film version of &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; with Gilbert Roland and Mario Custodio. &quot;The King&#x27;s Fifth&quot; served as inspiration for the 1982 anime television series &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold,&quot; a Japan-France co-production that was aired in several different countries.

<doc id="814805" wikidata="Q15524746" url="?curid=814805" title="Ersel Hickey">
<text>Ersel Hickey (born Ersel O&#x27;Hickey, June 27, 1934 – July 12, 2004) was an American rockabilly singer best known for his hit song &quot;Bluebirds over the Mountain&quot;.

==Early life==
Hickey was born in Brighton, New York, and was named after the family doctor, Dr. Ersel. His mother was from Kingston, Ontario; his father, who was Irish, died when Hickey was four. He was one of eight children. One brother&#x27;s name was Allen and another brother&#x27;s name was William. His mother had a nervous breakdown and was put into a mental hospital, causing Hickey to be placed in successive foster homes. He would frequently run away, living in different parts of New York State.

When Hickey was 15, he started traveling with his sister Chicky Evans, an exotic dancer. She was very popular in the carnival circuits and together they traveled for about a year. He decided to go on his own and travel with the carnival, then left and began living in Columbus, Ohio. From there he was sent to a &quot;tough kids&quot; home, where he became familiar with the main rhythm and blues groups and started singing with the gospel group there.

==Career==
In 1954, Hickey heard Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care if the Sun Don&#x27;t Shine&quot; and became a devoted fan of rock and roll. He played a few venues in Rochester, New York that his brother booked him in, and was successfully drawing audiences. It was around this time that he made his first record on Fine Records. One side was &quot;Then I&#x27;ll Be Happy&quot;, an old song; the other side was &quot;Baby You&#x27;re No Good&quot;, a song he had written. The single was released locally, but not much happened with it.

While visiting Rochester in 1957, Phil Everly told Hickey he should write his own material. That night Hickey wrote &quot;Bluebirds Over the Mountain&quot;, which he subsequently recorded and charted at No. 75 in the United States and No. 8 in Canada. The song was later recorded by Ritchie Valens in 1958 and was a top 100 hit for The Beach Boys in the United States and the United Kingdom in 1968.

Hickey also wrote songs for other artists, including &quot;The Millionaire&quot; for Jackie Wilson, &quot;A Little Bird Told Me So&quot; for LaVern Baker, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Rain Come Down&quot;, which was a US top ten hit for the Serendipity Singers.

Hickey&#x27;s contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

In 1957, Hickey was staying with his aunt in Buffalo, New York when he arranged to have publicity pictures taken at a local photography studio, Gene Laverne&#x27;s &quot;Studio of the Stars&quot;. The pose—Hickey with his knees bent and pointing his guitar like a machine gun—was the idea of Laverne, an exotic dancer and female impersonator. The photograph appeared in 1976 on the opening page of The &quot;Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

==Influence==
Actor Ron Thompson based many of his dance moves on Hickey&#x27;s, who was Thompson&#x27;s mentor and friend, for his performance in the film &quot;American Pop&quot;.

==Death==
Hickey died at age 70 in July 2004 after surgery to remove his gallbladder at New York University Medical Center.

<doc id="814816" wikidata="Q4328383" url="?curid=814816" title="Newtonian potential">
<text>In mathematics, the Newtonian potential or Newton potential is an operator in vector calculus that acts as the inverse to the negative Laplacian, on functions that are smooth and decay rapidly enough at infinity. As such, it is a fundamental object of study in potential theory. In its general nature, it is a singular integral operator, defined by convolution with a function having a mathematical singularity at the origin, the Newtonian kernel formula_1 which is the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation. It is named for Isaac Newton, who first discovered it and proved that it was a harmonic function in the special case of three variables, where it served as the fundamental gravitational potential in Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. In modern potential theory, the Newtonian potential is instead thought of as an electrostatic potential.

The Newtonian potential of a compactly supported integrable function formula_2 is defined as the convolution
formula_3
where the Newtonian kernel formula_1 in dimension formula_5 is defined by
formula_6

Here &quot;ω&quot;&quot;d&quot; is the volume of the unit &quot;d&quot;-ball (sometimes sign conventions may vary; compare and ). For example, for formula_7 we have formula_8

The Newtonian potential &quot;w&quot; of &quot;f&quot; is a solution of the Poisson equation
formula_9
which is to say that the operation of taking the Newtonian potential of a function is a partial inverse to the Laplace operator. Then &quot;w&quot; will be a classical solution, that is twice differentiable, if &quot;f&quot; is bounded and locally Hölder continuous as shown by Otto Hölder. It was an open question whether continuity alone is also sufficient. This was shown to be wrong by Henrik Petrini who gave an example of a continuous &quot;f&quot; for which &quot;w&quot; is not twice differentiable.
The solution is not unique, since addition of any harmonic function to &quot;w&quot; will not affect the equation. This fact can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the Poisson equation in suitably regular domains, and for suitably well-behaved functions &quot;f&quot;: one first applies a Newtonian potential to obtain a solution, and then adjusts by adding a harmonic function to get the correct boundary data.

The Newtonian potential is defined more broadly as the convolution
formula_10
when &quot;μ&quot; is a compactly supported Radon measure. It satisfies the Poisson equation
formula_11
in the sense of distributions. Moreover, when the measure is positive, the Newtonian potential is subharmonic on R&quot;d&quot;.

If &quot;f&quot; is a compactly supported continuous function (or, more generally, a finite measure) that is rotationally invariant, then the convolution of &quot;f&quot; with satisfies for &quot;x&quot; outside the support of &quot;f&quot;
formula_12

In dimension &quot;d&quot; = 3, this reduces to Newton&#x27;s theorem that the potential energy of a small mass outside a much larger spherically symmetric mass distribution is the same as if all of the mass of the larger object were concentrated at its center.

When the measure &quot;μ&quot; is associated to a mass distribution on a sufficiently smooth hypersurface &quot;S&quot; (a Lyapunov surface of Hölder class &quot;C&quot;1,α) that divides R&quot;d&quot; into two regions &quot;D&quot;+ and &quot;D&quot;−, then the Newtonian potential of &quot;μ&quot; is referred to as a simple layer potential. Simple layer potentials are continuous and solve the Laplace equation except on &quot;S&quot;. They appear naturally in the study of electrostatics in the context of the electrostatic potential associated to a charge distribution on a closed surface. If is the product of a continuous function on &quot;S&quot; with the (&quot;d&quot; − 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure, then at a point &quot;y&quot; of &quot;S&quot;, the normal derivative undergoes a jump discontinuity &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) when crossing the layer. Furthermore, the normal derivative of &quot;w&quot; is a well-defined continuous function on &quot;S&quot;. This makes simple layers particularly suited to the study of the Neumann problem for the Laplace equation.

<text>Dr. Manuel Antonio Alonso Pacheco (October 6, 1822 – November 4, 1889) was a Puerto Rican writer, poet, journalist and physician. He is considered to be the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance.

==Early years==
Alonso was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His father Juan Francisco Alonso was a Galician soldier and his mother María de África de Pacheco was a native of Ceuta of Spanish origin. He received his primary education in Caguas and in the Ildefonso Seminary in San Juan. Alonso then went to the City of Barcelona, Spain where he enrolled in the University of Barcelona to study medicine. He finished his medical studies in 1844 and practiced his profession in Barcelona.

==Works ==

In 1845, he published a book called &quot;El Gíbaro&quot; (&quot;The Jíbaro&quot;). &quot;El Gíbaro&quot; was a collection of verses whose main themes were the humble Puerto Rican subsistence farmer and the customs of Puerto Rico.

==Return to Puerto Rico==
In 1848, Alonso returned to Puerto Rico and set up his medical office in the City of Caguas. He also became the director of the House of Benefit of San Juan, until the day of his death. In collaboration with other notable writers of the day, he published the &quot;Album Puertorriqueño&quot; (Puerto Rican Album), which was the second anthology of poems to be published in the island. Alonso died in the City of San Juan on November 4, 1889. He was buried at Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan.

==Poet and journalist==
As a writer, poet and journalist he derived his inspiration from anything that had to do with love and his country. Alonso cultivated his verses and gave them a touch festivality. Alonso was also a member of the Liberal Reform movement in Puerto Rico and directed that organizations publication, (The Agent).

Among his poems are:
* &quot;&quot;, about  Antonio de los Reyes Correa
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

==Short stories==
Some of the short stories Alonso wrote include:
*
*
*
*

Puerto Rico has honored his memory by naming schools and public buildings after him.

<text>New York Crew was a 7-inch EP released by the New York City hardcore band Judge. The record was released on guitarist John Porcelly&#x27;s record label, Schism Records, in 1988. The record was then later repressed by Revelation Records.

At the time of recording and release, Judge was a two-man project, featuring both John &quot;Porcell&quot; Porcelly (at the time of Youth Of Today) and former Death Before Dishonor drummer Mike &quot;Judge&quot; Ferraro. Porcell played the guitar and bass tracks on the record, whilst Mike played drums as well as doing the vocal tracks (not both at the same time). The EP only took about five hours to complete, including the mixing.

The following year, in 1989, as well as re-pressing the EP onto vinyl, the tracks also appeared as bonus tracks on the end of CD version of the band&#x27;s LP, &quot;Bringin&#x27; It Down&quot;, released by Revelation Records. In 2005, Revelation Records re-released the tracks again, this time as part of the band&#x27;s discography, entitled &quot;What It Meant: The Complete Discography&quot;.

== Track listing ==

# Fed Up
# In My Way
# I&#x27;ve Lost...
# New York Crew
# Warriors (originally by Blitz)

== Band members ==
At time of release

* John &quot;Porcell&quot; Porcelly: Guitar/Bass
* Mike &quot;Judge&quot; Ferraro: Vocals/Drums

== Pressing information ==
=== Schism Records ===
 Schism Records #2 - 1988
* 1988 - 1st Press:
** 1000 black vinyl, white labels and printed inner sleeve.
* 1988 - 2nd Press:
** 1000 black vinyl, yellow labels and printed inner sleeve.
* 1988 - 3rd Press:
** 1000 black vinyl, yellow labels and separate lyric sheet.

==== Difference between pressings ====

Both the 1st and 2nd presses feature the gang vocals &quot;You Lost My Respect&quot; as the song In My Way opens, the 3rd press does not have this as a different mix was used due to the original being lost when the pressing plant went out of business.

Also the matrix changed from &quot;82 and on&quot; to &quot;We Miss Kellogs&quot;. This version was later used on the first presses of the Revelation Records release.

=== Revelation Records ===
Revelation Records #14 - 1989 - n/a
* 1989 - 1st Press:
** 1000 blue vinyl, orange sleeve, orange lyric sheet
** 4000 black vinyl, orange sleeve, orange lyric sheet
* Later Presses:
** black vinyl, yellow paper sleeve, white lyric sheet
** black vinyl, yellow glossy sleeve, white lyric sheet

==== Difference between pressings ====

The 1st and several later presses used the same plate used on the 3rd press of the original Schism Records release. This is evident as the matrix is exactly the same, reading &quot;Schism-2 A&quot; and &quot;Schism-2 B&quot; on respective sides as well as &quot;We Miss Kellogs&quot;.

The colour of the sleeve in which the record was packaged changed from orange to yellow between the early and later presses.

Also at some point between presses, Revelation Records moved from New Haven, Connecticut to Huntington Beach, California. The earlier presses feature the New Haven address while later presses have the Huntington Beach address.

<text>Rudolph A. LaRusso (November 11, 1937 – July 9, 2004) was an American professional basketball player who was a five-time All-Star in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was nicknamed &quot;Roughhouse Rudy.&quot;

==Early life==
LaRusso was Jewish, and was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn. LaRusso, whose mother was Jewish and father was Italian, won All-City honors and was later inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame. He attended and graduated from Dartmouth College. In 1959, playing for Dartmouth, he grabbed 32 rebounds in a game against Columbia, tying an Ivy League record. He also set Dartmouth records for rebounds in a season (503) and career (1,239), and was twice named All-Ivy League.

==Professional career==

===Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers (1960–1967)===
He was taken by the Minneapolis Lakers in the second round of the 1959 NBA draft out of Dartmouth College, and played eight years with them and two for the San Francisco Warriors. On November 26, 1959, he scored 15 points and 20 rebounds in a 95–114 loss to the Cincinnati Royals. He became the second Lakers rookie to have grabbed at least 20 rebounds in a single game, joining teammate Elgin Baylor. On February 24, 1960, he scored a season-high 27 points in a 110–131 loss to the Boston Celtics.

In his second year, LaRusso slightly improved his statistics from his rookie season. In his second game of the season, LaRusso recorded a career-high 28 points in a 96–112 loss to the St. Louis Hawks.

In 1962, he scored 50 points, at that point the most ever by a Jewish NBA basketball player, in a game for the Lakers against the St. Louis Hawks. In 1967–68, he finished seventh in the league with a career-best average of 21.8 ppg.

===San Francisco Warriors (1968–1969)===

==Player profile==
He was a five-time All-Star and was known for his rebounding, tight defense, toughness, and presence.

==Personal life==
LaRusso had a small cameo role in the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; third-season episode &quot;Bang! Bang! Bang!&quot; as &#x27;Agent Michaels&#x27;.

He died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2004. He has a son, Corey LaRusso, and a daughter from another marriage, Christine Larusso, a Los Angeles-based poet.

<text>Bringin&#x27; It Down is an LP released by the New York hardcore band Judge. It was released on Revelation Records in 1989. The original recording of the album was released under the title &quot;Chung King Can Suck It&quot; (with two additional tracks that did not make it onto &quot;Bringin&#x27; It Down&quot;). This recording, which had been made at Chung King Studios, was rejected by the band after thousands of dollars had been spent on it. Since there had been substantial pre-orders of &quot;Bringin&#x27; It Down&quot; the label printed 110 copies of the rejected recording under its alternate title, to satisfy demand until the band could re-record it at a different studio. The popularity of Judge in the hardcore straight edge scene, and the severely limited release, has made &quot;Chung King Can Suck It&quot; likely the most sought after and expensive hardcore record ever (though Revelation Records never profited from it). Copies, when they are sold, sell for over a thousand dollars.

<text>The channel-billed toucan (Ramphastos vitellinus) is a near-passerine bird in the family Ramphastidae found on the Caribbean island of Trinidad and in tropical South America as far south as southern Brazil and central Bolivia.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
=== Subspecies ===
Three subspecies are recognized:
These subspecies were previously considered separate species, but all three, along with the citron-throated toucan, will interbreed freely wherever they meet. However, the subspecies &quot;R. v. ariel&quot; is closer to &quot;R. v. culminatus&quot; than to the nominate, and are by some already considered close to distinct species status. As &quot;R. v. ariel&quot; was described before &quot;R. v. culminatus&quot;, if separated they would become &quot;Ramphastos ariel ariel&quot; and &quot;R. a. culminatus&quot;. There also exists an isolated population in eastern Brazil. It looks very similar to, and has traditionally been considered part of, &quot;R. v. ariel&quot;, but molecular analysis suggests that it has been isolated for a long time and is a yet-undescribed separate subspecies or possibly even species (Weckstein, 2005).

==Description==

Like other toucans, the channel-billed is brightly marked and has a huge bill. It is typically long with a 9–14 cm (3½-5½ in) bill. It weighs 

* Nominate race (&quot;R. v. vitellinus&quot;): Its upperparts, belly, tail and most of the bill are black, and the uppertail and undertail coverts are red. The bare eye-patch and bill base are blue, the throat is white, most of the central breast is yellow-orange fading to white laterally and the lower breast sharply contrasts with a broad transverse red band. The iris is dark brownish. It is found in the north-eastern part of this species&#x27; range.
* Race &quot;culminatus&quot;: It resembles the nominate, but has a yellow base of the upper mandible and ridge to its bill, orange-yellow uppertail coverts and the throat and breast are white (occasionally tinged yellow), with just a narrow red band separating the latter from the black belly. It occurs in the eastern and south-central part of this species&#x27; range. It is very similar to, and easily confused with, Cuvier&#x27;s toucan (&quot;Ramphastos tucanus cuvieri&quot;).
* Race &quot;ariel&quot;: It resembles the nominate, but the base of its bill is yellow, the skin around the pale blue eye is red and the entire throat and chest are orange. It occurs in the south-east Amazon. The unnamed population from the coastal regions of eastern Brazil is virtually identical.
* Race &quot;citreolaemus&quot;. It resembles &quot;culminatus&quot;, but with a clear yellow tinge to the throat, a green tinge to the otherwise yellow culmen, a yellow-orange patch at the very base of the bill, and a pale bluish iris. It occurs in northern Colombia and north-western Venezuela.

Wherever the distributions of the subspecies meet, individuals with features that are intermediate compared to above described races are common due to hybridization. Some of these intermediate populations have sometimes been awarded subspecies status, e.g. &quot;theresae&quot; for the population in north-eastern Brazil and &quot;pintoi&quot; for populations in south-central Brazil (both are &quot;culminatus&quot;-&quot;ariel&quot; intergrades).

==Habitat==
Found in forest and woodland. Prefers humid regions, but locally extends into drier regions (esp. along rivers). Mainly in lowlands, but locally to an altitude of .

==Behavior==
This species is an arboreal fruit-eater but will take insects, small reptiles, eggs and frogs. Typically consumed are lipid-rich fruits such as &quot;Virola&quot; and &quot;Euterpe&quot; palm fruits. Other fruits which the channel-billed toucan feeds upon are those borne by &quot;Cecropia&quot;, &quot;Ficus&quot;, &quot;Hevea&quot;, &quot;Nectandra&quot;, &quot;Oenocarpus&quot;, &quot;Pourouma&quot; and &quot;Pouteria&quot;. They will also consume papaya, mangoes, avocados and peppers if human intrusions into their habitat occur. The call is a croaking &quot;cree-op cree-op cree-op&quot;.

The parents are both active in raising the young. The white eggs are laid in a high unlined tree cavity. There is a gestation period of 18 days, and the parents both incubate for 15 to 16 days. However, they can be impatient sitters, often leaving their eggs uncovered for hours at a time. Newborn toucans remain in the nest after hatching. They are blind and naked at birth, and their eyes open after about 3 weeks. They have short bills and specialized pads on their heels to protect them from the rough floor of the nest. The feathers do not begin to expand until they are nearly 4 weeks old. They are helpless and unable to leave the nest for about 8 weeks, dependent upon both parents to feed them. After this, the young can care for themselves. They begin to leave the nest after 40 to 50 days, depending on size.

<doc id="815012" wikidata="Q3492086" url="?curid=815012" title="Rear Window Captioning System">
<text>The Rear Window Captioning System (RWC) is a method for presenting, through captions, a transcript of the audio portion of a film in theatres for deaf and hard-of-hearing people. The system was co-developed by WGBH and Rufus Butler Seder.

On the way into the theatre, viewers pick up a reflective plastic panel mounted on a flexible stalk. The panel sits in a seat cupholder or on the floor adjacent to the seat. A large LED display is mounted on a rear wall that displays caption characters in mirror image. Viewers move the panels into position (usually below the movie screen) so they can read the reflected captions and watch the movie. It is sometimes necessary to sit in a certain area of the theater to obtain the best angle for reflecting the backward text emitted from the back of the theater on the panel while also being able to view the movie at the same time.

Through this method, all screenings of a film can be accessible to caption viewers. Others seated alongside do not watch, or usually even see, the captions.

Rear Window captioning is an alternative to open captioning, in which text is permanently visible. Open captioning has been little-used due to the fear that it was too intrusive and noticeable to hearing viewers. However, no studies have been conducted to elicit hearing people&#x27;s opinions on how they will adapt to reading captions on screen. Rear Window captioning is a form of closed captioning because the viewer must choose to view the captions.
Few movie exhibitors or theater chains choose to provide Rear Window captioning. One of the reasons often stated for not providing Rear Window captioning is the cost of the hardware (as of 2011, approximately US $4,500 per screen for a single installation, less for multiple installations in a multiplex). The cost of captioning a film is on the order of US$4,000 (about $40 per minute).

For blind viewers, audio description (Descriptive Video Service, DVS) can be and usually is transmitted along with captions. Viewers listen to the descriptions via wireless headsets.

In the Rear Window system, the film print is unaffected. With the transition to Digital Cinema, closed captions are included in many digital cinema packages.

In many movie advertisements by a specific cinema, the &quot;RWC&quot; acronym is often used, much like the CC acronym is used to indicate the availability of closed captions on television shows. Often, &quot;RWC/DVS&quot; notation is used, indicating the availability of both Rear Window Captioning and Descriptive Video Service.

<doc id="815042" wikidata="Q5196401" url="?curid=815042" title="Custom Robo">
<text>is an action role-playing video game series developed by Noise and published by Nintendo.

The series spans five games, and has titles on the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and Nintendo DS. Only the two most recent titles have seen a release outside of Japan. &quot;Custom Robo Arena&quot; was first released in Japan on October 19, 2006, later seeing international release in 2007.

==International release==
Beginning in 1999, the &quot;Custom Robo&quot; series has largely been exclusive to Japan. In 2001, however, Nintendo released &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, a fighting game containing characters from throughout the company&#x27;s history, worldwide. In the title&#x27;s trophy room, three custom robos from &quot;Custom Robo V2&quot; appeared as trophies: &quot;Ray Mk II&quot;, &quot;Bayonette&quot;, and &quot;Annie&quot;.

Stated by several issues of Nintendo Power, an international release of &quot;Custom Robo GX&quot;, the third title in the series, was planned but later canceled. The fourth title in the series, &quot;Custom Robo: Battle Revolution&quot;, would later be released in 2004, the first title in the series to receive and release outside of Japan. The fifth title of the series, &quot;Custom Robo Arena&quot;, would become the first and only &quot;Custom Robo&quot; title released globally.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Custom Robo&quot; is an arena fighting game that makes use of a mix and match gear loadout system similar to games such as &quot;Robotrek&quot; or &quot;Front Mission&quot;, but with frantic action battles in confined 3D arenas (2D arenas in &quot;Custom Robo GX&quot;), similar to &quot;Virtual On&quot;.

In &quot;Custom Robo&quot;, the object is to reduce the opponent&#x27;s hit points from 1000 to 0 by mixing together different Robos (bodies), guns, bombs and pods, usually by pressuring opponents into taking damage through various trap tactics allowed by a Robo&#x27;s customized loadout. Custom Robos are arranged in groups that are similar to their abilities. The endurance bar is located above the player&#x27;s hitbox; once it runs out, the Custom Robo gets &quot;downed&quot; which means that it stays fallen for a couple seconds. After the Robo gets up, it goes into &quot;rebirth&quot; mode, a temporary state of invincibility lasting 3 seconds. Should the player repeatedly lose the same battle, the game will offer the option of reducing the opponent&#x27;s initial health, in order to make the battle easier. If players continue to lose several times, the degree of handicap offered increases up to 75%, giving the opponent a starting HP of 250, rather than 1000.

In each game&#x27;s story mode, contextualized as a role-playing game, players slip into the role of a nameable protagonist just beginning to learn about Custom Robo. In each game, the first Robo players obtain is always the latest model of the &quot;Ray&quot; series. The goal for players is to improve their skills and collect different Custom Robo body kits and gear in order to defeat everyone, including champion Custom Robo users. The main objective of the game is to finish the storyline by collecting every Custom Robo and battle part, while winning every battle that moves players along through the story arc.

==Games==
The following is a list of games released in the series:

:Games predating &quot;Battle Revolution&quot; were released only in Japan (except the first one, which was also released in China for the iQue Player). Due to this, there are no official titles for North American or European releases of these games. Such a title may be given if Nintendo divisions outside Japan elects to localize any of these games to their regions.

A sequel to &quot;Custom Robo GX&quot; was originally planned for release on the Game Boy Advance, but the project was discontinued. It was planned for release in late 2005 in Japan.

<doc id="815049" wikidata="Q3282474" url="?curid=815049" title="Pac-Man Vs.">
<text>is a 2003 maze video game developed by Nintendo and published by Namco for the GameCube. In the game, one player takes control of Pac-Man, who must eat all of the pellets in the maze, while the others control the ghosts to try to catch them. The objective is to be the first to reach a set number of points, selected before the game begins. The player controlling Pac-Man uses the Game Boy Advance to play, while the others use the television to control the ghosts. The game requires the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable in order to play.

&quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot; was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo EAD, created as a tech demo to show off the capabilities of the GCN link cable. First shown at the Games Convention in Germany, under the working title &quot;Pac-Man for Nintendo GameCube&quot;, it was then presented to Namco, who took interest and agreed to publish it as a full game. &quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its interesting concept, multiplayer and addictive gameplay. Criticism was directed towards its small amount of content and lack of memory card support. It was ported to the Nintendo DS through &quot;Namco Museum DS&quot; (2007) and the Nintendo Switch through &quot;Namco Museum&quot; (2017).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot; is a maze video game. The game requires a Game Boy Advance, the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable peripheral, and one to three GameCube controllers to play. Before the game begins, a predetermined score value can be set to either 7,000, 10,000 or 15,000 points; the first player to reach this score wins. One of the players will be assigned as Pac-Man, the others being the ghosts. The player controlling Pac-Man uses the Game Boy Advance to play, the objective being to eat all the dots in the maze without being caught by a ghost. Eating large flashing &quot;Power Pellets&quot; will cause the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them to steal points and send them back to the regeneration box in the middle of the maze. If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, the person that caught him will become Pac-Man in the next round. Eating a certain amount of pellets will cause a fruit to appear underneath the regeneration box, which Pac-Man or the ghosts can eat for bonus points.

The remaining players will take control of the ghosts on the television screen, who must catch Pac-Man before he eats all of the pellets in the maze. If Pac-Man consumes a Power Pellet, the ghosts will turn blue and become slower, and must avoid contact with Pac-Man. The ghosts have a limited field of vision, which can be increased for a limited period of time by eating fruit that appears in the middle of the stage. If there are fewer than four players in the game, uncontrolled ghosts will become gray-colored CPUs that are harmless to Pac-Man — however, a ghost can touch him to tag it with his or her color, which can kill Pac-Man and count towards that player&#x27;s score.

Pac-Man can earn points by eating pellets, vulnerable ghosts and fruit, while ghosts can earn them by eating fruit and catching Pac-Man. Should Pac-Man clear the stage of pellets, the person controlling him will earn 1,600 point bonus and will continue to play as him in the next stage, however Pac-Man will also lose that same amount to a ghost who catches him. Mario (voiced by Charles Martinet) appears as an announcer and will commentate on the game, such as when Pac-Man eats a Power Pellet or when a fruit appears in the stage. Six different mazes can be selected, each having different layouts and music.

==Development==
&quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot; was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development (EAD) for the GameCube. A fan of the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot; arcade game, Miyamoto designed a tech demo to show off the capabilities of the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable peripheral, where one player controlled Pac-Man and three others controlled the ghosts. A short demo was shown off at the Games Convention in Germany, simply titled &quot;Pac-Man for Nintendo GameCube&quot;, where it gained a sizable amount of attention. The game took a month to complete, where it was then shown to Namco, who took interest and agreed to publish it as a full game. It was presented at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), with &quot;Pac-Man&quot; creator Toru Iwatani invited to the presentation as a guest. The game was released in Japan on November 27, 2003, in North America on December 2, 2003, and in PAL regions on April 2, 2004.

In Japan, the game was released as a prize for members of Club Nintendo. In North America, the game was released as a pre-order extra with the GameCube versions of &quot;I-Ninja&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and bundled with the player&#x27;s choice re-release of &quot;Pac-Man World 2&quot;. In Europe, the game was bundled with &quot;R Racing&quot;, with the game&#x27;s distributor Electronic Arts announcing this in February 2004.

A remake of the game was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007 as part of &quot;Namco Museum DS&quot;, using the system&#x27;s Download Play function for multiplayer. A version for mobile phones was also released that utilized Bluetooth for multiplayer. A high-definition remake of the GameCube version was released in 2017 for the Nintendo Switch &quot;Namco Museum&quot; compilation, requiring two systems to play (one must have the full game while the other must also own either the full game or a free Pac Man VS download app). A single-console mode is also included, where players controlled the ghosts to catch a computer-controlled Pac-Man. The multiplayer aspect of the original GameCube release was re-used for the online battle mode in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass&quot; (2007).

==Reception==

&quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its clever take on the core gameplay, multiplayer and replay value. It holds a 78/100 on Metacritic.

&quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; called it &quot;a must-have for parties&quot;, while &quot;GamePro&quot; said it was worth owning for its &quot;posterity&quot; alone. &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Nintendojo&quot; praised the game&#x27;s interesting take on the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; gameplay, with &quot;IGN&quot; in particular noting that it is &quot;intuitive for anyone regardless of their gaming skill levels&quot;. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; highly praised the game&#x27;s multiplayer aspect for keeping the gameplay frantic and fast-paced. A similar response was echoed by &quot;IGN&quot;, who called it &quot;incredibly fun&quot; and said it added to the overall experience. In their review for &quot;Namco Museum DS&quot;, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine said the package was worth it for &quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot; alone, praising its addictive gameplay and multiplayer focus. &quot;Polygon&quot; called it one of the best &quot;Pac-Man&quot; games.

Despite its praise, the game was criticized for its small amount of content and lack of memory card support. &quot;Nintendojo&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s lack of depth and for not being able to save high scores to a memory card. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; had a similar response, also criticizing its limited availability to consumers. While &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; found the commentary from Mario to be annoying, &quot;Nintendojo&quot; said that it was helpful for when something happens outside the player&#x27;s vision, although commented that it was largely unnecessary. &quot;GamePro&quot; disliked Pac-Man&#x27;s slow movement and controls. Several critics would argue that the game being a free extra dismissed much of its criticism, with &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; even saying that there is &quot;not much reason to be disappointed with a lack of features&quot;.

<doc id="815053" wikidata="Q685808" url="?curid=815053" title="Asadabad, Afghanistan">
<text>Asadabad (), also called Chaghasarai (), is the capital city of Kunar Province in Afghanistan. It is located in the eastern-northeastern portion of the country. The city is located within a valley at the confluence of the Pech River and Kunar River between two mountain ridgelines running along both sides of the valley from Northeast to Southwest.

Asadabad is in a mountainous region of the Hindu Kush mountains about 13 km (eight miles) northwest of the Pakistani border and northeast of Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Asadabad deals with a moderate amount of trade goods. Nawa Pass, that lies about south of Asadabad, is the next major border crossing point north of the Khyber Pass for the region. The pass is under constant observation due to its relative ease to cross for commerce and its potential usage for smuggling and Taliban insurgents.

On 14 August 2021, Asadabad was seized by Taliban fighters, becoming the twenty-first provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive.

== History ==

The surrounding Kunar Province lies near the historic routes connecting Central Asia, India, and Iran, such as the Silk Road and the Grand Trunk Road through the Khyber Pass, as well as routes through the Hindu Kush mountains. Asadabad lies at the confluence of the two major rivers of the area, the Kunar and the Pech. The region would have come under the borders of various empires of the ages, including the Achaemenid Persians, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, the Yousufzai Tribe, and many more. It was very close to the paths Alexander the Great passed by on his way from conquering Persia to invading India. Asadabad is also on the eastern boundary of what was Kafiristan - part of Afghanistan not converted to Islam until the 1890s. One testament to this is the Waigali name of nearby Dam Kelay, &quot;Dam Kil&quot;.

In the past, the area near Asadabad was called &quot;Chagha Sarai&quot;, with various spellings (Chaga Serai, Chagasaray, Chigur Serai, Chughansuraee).

Emperor Babur (late 15th century/early 16th century) claims to have taken over the town as part of his military campaigns in the area. He describes it very briefly in his book, Baburnama. He also mentions relations with the Kaffirs, whom he claims helped defend the town against him.

In the late 19th century/early 20th century the capital of the region was moved from Pushoot/Pasat/Pasad to the present Asadabad location. Over the 20th century, various technical improvements were made such as roads, a shopping area, schools, a bridge, a gas station, etc.

===Soviet Afghan war===
In the opening times of the Soviet Afghan war (1979–1988), Kunar province saw some of the first rebellions against the communist People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan. As punishment, PDPA troops with Soviet advisors massacred the males of the nearby village of Kerala, burying their bodies in a field near the Pech river. Asadabad was later linked to a Soviet military base during the war, which included Spetsnaz. Several Russian websites, like http://asadabad.ru , contain discussions and photos regarding this era.

In January 1979, a large guerrilla force, reported by the contemporary press - estimated - at 5,000 strong, attempted to capture the town, which was the headquarters of the Afghan Army&#x27;s 9th Division.

In 1985, in the Battle of Maravar Pass the Afghan Mujahideen killed 31 Soviet troops in an ambush.

===Mujahideen control===
The rebel Mujahideen later took over the town from the Soviets. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hizb-e-Islami, one of the Peshawar Seven groups, had heavy influence in the area. Osama bin Laden also spent time in Asadabad.

On 20 April 1991, the marketplace of Asadabad was hit by two Scud missiles, that killed 300 and wounded 500 inhabitants. Though the exact toll is unknown, these attacks resulted in heavy civilian casualties. The explosions destroyed the headquarters of Islamic leader Jamil al-Rahman, and killed a number of his followers.

===2001-2021 war===
In 2001 the War on Terror began with the invasion of Afghanistan, including Kunar Province. Forward Operating Base Camp Wright was set up a few kilometres south of Asadabad. According to an Army article, the camp was originally built by the Soviets.
The city was captured by the Taliban on 14 August 2021, as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive.

==Climate==
Asadabad has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification system. The average annual temperature in Asadabad is . About of precipitation falls annually.

== Economy ==

About 10% - 15% of the valley surrounding Asadabad is used for agriculture by using an ancient land development technique called terracing. However, flooding and erosion have been an issue in the past. The primary crops are wheat, rice, sugarcane and vegetables. Multiple international agencies are assisting with these issues and other issues throughout the province.

As of January 2009, growth around Asadabad has been substantial. Examples of development are:
* Kunar province&#x27;s main marketplace now has more than 600 stores, up from 100 just three years ago.
* Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) have constructed 16 schools, 20 medical clinics, and 8 district centers.
* PRTs completed construction on 13 roads and 11 bridges.
* Agribusiness Developmental Teams (ADTs) have several evolving projects and over 10 demonstration farms.
* Jalalabad-Asmar and Pech River roads have cut travel times in half and connected Asadabad centers of commerce with Jalalabad.

==Law enforcement==

The Afghan National Police provide security for the city and district. There is also the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), led by the United States armed forces. It is not only helping the Afghan government to develop the area but is also training the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), including the Afghan Border Police and the Afghan Armed Forces.

==Sport==
The Kunar Cricket Ground opened in 2018 and has played host to first-class cricket matches in the Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament and the Mirwais Nika Provincial 3-Day Tournament. The ground is most notable for a match between Kabul Region and Boost Region in the 2018 Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament, when Kabul batsman Shafiqullah scored the fastest double century in first-class cricket. He scored 200 not out from 89 balls, and also scored the most sixes in a first-class match, with 24.

==Notable residents and incidents==
*U.S. Navy Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during Operation Red Wings, which took place in the mountainous terrain near Asadabad from June to July 2005.
*US Operations: &quot;Big East Wind&quot; and Operation Mountain Lion
*A man named Abdul Wali was tortured to death by CIA contractor David Passaro at the nearby US military base in 2003. Wali had brought himself in for questioning regarding the rocket attacks on the base, at the suggestion of the provincial governor, who told him he wouldn&#x27;t be harmed. Passaro was later convicted of assault after 82nd Airborne Division troops testified against him. He received 8+ years in prison.

<doc id="815085" wikidata="Q2181182" url="?curid=815085" title="Kirby Air Ride">
<text>Kirby Air Ride is a 2003 racing video game starring Kirby, developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the GameCube.

&quot;Kirby Air Ride has&quot; the players and computer-controlled racers ride on Air Ride Machines. The game supports up to four players, and was the first GameCube title to support LAN play using broadband adapters and up to four GameCube systems. It was the final &quot;Kirby&quot; game directed by series creator Masahiro Sakurai.

The game had a convoluted development cycle, starting as one of the first wave of Nintendo 64 games before undergoing numerous revisions to the basic concept and being cancelled for a time. Upon its eventual release for the GameCube it saw a mixed reception from critics, who criticized its simplicity, but was a commercial success, selling over 1.2 million copies worldwide. The game has developed a cult following since then, with dedicated fans praising the game&#x27;s battle royale multiplayer for being ahead of its time, and continuing to play the game through emulator online play.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot; is played primarily through use of a vehicle, many of which are taken from the previous &quot;Kirby&quot; games, such as the Warpstar. Players take control of Kirby or any of his multicolored counterparts to compete in races or other minigames.

The simple controls are a defining feature of &quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot;. Unlike most racers, no input is necessary for the craft to move forward. Other than the use of the Control Stick to steer, the A button performs all the other actions in the game, including braking, charging up for a boost, sucking in nearby enemies and thereafter using the powers absorbed from them. Gliding is also a definitive feature of the game, as the player can control the crafts&#x27; altitude when they go airborne.

Each of the three modes of the game has a &quot;checklist&quot; associated with it. These are 12x10 grids which contain 120 squares, all of which are initially blank. Each square has a hidden goal contained inside it, and certain goals also have unlockable content attached to them, such as alternate machines, new items and courses, new characters, and music tracks for the sound test. When a goal is completed, the squares fill to reveal completed goals. In practice, this system of discovering unknown goals is balanced out by several goals which are relatively easy to obtain, such as &quot;finish a race three times&quot; or &quot;race on every course,&quot; and various other goals which only require the accrual of play time; these, in turn, make it easier to find out what other, more specific goals are, since each goal unlocked will open up the objective of the goals touching the goal completed.

Kirby is the only playable character available from the start of the game, and the only one who can ride different machines and suck up enemies to copy their abilities. Multiple players are represented by different colors of Kirby. Meta Knight, Kirby&#x27;s rival, is an unlockable character. He doesn&#x27;t ride machines, but instead uses his wings to float above the ground. He controls like a combination of Wing Kirby and Sword Kirby, as he uses sword attacks automatically when he approaches enemies or other players. Because he has high speed and acceleration in the game, he cannot charge. King Dedede is also unlockable. Controlling him is almost exactly like using the Wheelie Bike, except he can attack automatically with his hammer, similar to Meta Knight&#x27;s attack.

===Modes of play===
;Air Ride
Air Ride is a basic, back-view racing mode. The player chooses a racing machine and races against up to three other human or computer players via split-screen or LAN to get to the finish before anyone else. There are two ways to play a typical Air Ride race:
*Laps: Laps is the default mode, where the player finishes the race by completing a set number of laps around the course. The number of laps can be custom set from 1 to 99, or kept at the track&#x27;s default. The default number of laps may depend on the current course.
*Time: In Time mode, players race for a set amount of time, and the player that goes the farthest down the track wins the match.
In both modes, the Kirbys may swallow and acquire the abilities of enemies strewn along the track and use those powers against their rivals. Doing so will slow Kirby&#x27;s enemies down and potentially do damage to them (if the Health Bar is activated for the race.) In addition to the racing mode, Air Ride also has the option of Time Attack mode, where a single-player races around a track for three laps. Lastly, a single player can also race Free Run mode, an endless race with the sole purpose of reaching the fastest possible Lap Time.

;Top Ride
Top Ride is a racing mode on smaller, simpler tracks, and is viewed from above the track. Due to the decreased track size, the default number of laps is increased per track. Top Ride has only two vehicles to choose from; the red Free Star moves in the direction the Control Stick is tilted, while the blue Steer Star rotates clockwise or counterclockwise based on tilting the Control Stick right or left. Like Air Ride, Top Ride also has Time Attack and Free Run modes. There are seven courses total, based on seven different themes: Grass, Sand, Sky, Fire, Light, Water, and Metal.

;City Trial
City Trial is a larger mode where players must navigate a city, along with several more sections such as a forest, cave, and volcano, while grabbing Air Ride machine upgrade items, such as boosts, top speeds, charges, offense, defense, and more. Various Air Ride vehicles are randomly scattered throughout the city, allowing the player to switch vehicles at any time in the game. Players can even collect rare machine pieces to fuse together into a &quot;Legendary Air Ride Machine,&quot; either the Dragoon or the Hydra. This mode also features random events such as falling meteors, UFOs, Dyna Blade, rail station fires, bouncing items, fake power-ups, a strange pillar, a thief, all the boxes containing the same items, dense fog, and more. When time expires, players face off in a small competition that tests how well your machine ended up, which can vary between a drag race, a brawl, a contest to destroy the most enemies, a gliding game, and even a lap on one of the Air Ride courses.

==Development== 
&quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot; was initially known interchangeably as Kirby Bowl 64 or Kirby Ball 64 (&quot;Kirby Ball&quot; is the Japanese name for &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course&quot;), and later as Kirby&#x27;s Air Ride. It began development during the early days of the Nintendo 64 video game console. Much of the development was spearheaded by Masahiro Sakurai, the creator of Kirby. It was one of only two playable demos shown at the Nintendo 64&#x27;s unveiling at the 1995 Shoshinkai show (the other being &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;). At this point the game consisted of two sub-games. One was somewhat similar to &quot;Marble Madness&quot;, as players would control a ball-shaped Kirby to either race across an obstacle course (in single player) or knock competing players off the playing field (in multiplayer), similar to &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course&quot;. The other more closely resembled the final game: a snowboarding race in which Kirby collects stars for points. It went through many changes during its elongated development period (the version shown at the 1996 E3 resembled a skateboarding sim) before eventually being canceled. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto said in an early 1998 interview that the project had been temporarily halted so that Nintendo could focus efforts on finishing &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; and rework the &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Air Ride&quot; concept.

The game resurfaced on the GameCube in the form of a short video preview in March 2003 at the annual DICE summit in Las Vegas, at which point it received its final title. This preview received a mainly negative reception due to slow speeds and poor graphics, factors which the Nintendo 64 prototype had also been criticized for.

&quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot; was first seen in playable form at E3 in May later that year. The demo contained five playable tracks and three different game modes. The reception to this playable demo was more positive than the video preview.

Masahiro Sakurai, the game designer behind most of the early games in the &quot;Kirby&quot; series, resigned from his position at HAL Laboratory shortly after the game&#x27;s release, citing that he was tiring of the constant pressure from the industry to keep creating sequels.

===Music===
The soundtrack was composed by Jun Ishikawa, Shogo Sakai, Hirokazu Ando, and Tadashi Ikegami. The latter three of those composers also worked on &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, while Ishikawa has been a regular composer for the &quot;Kirby&quot; series since its debut.

&quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot; also features songs from the Japanese version of &quot;&quot;, composed by Akira Miyagawa; the game was advertised at the end of some episodes, and a two-part special featuring vehicles from the game aired alongside the game&#x27;s launch.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot; sold 422,311 copies in Japan and 750,000 in the United States. Upon its release, the game received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Most websites and magazines praised its clean presentation, music, and the originality of the City Trial mode while criticizing its gameplay as being overly simple. &quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot;″s similarity to other titles released for the GameCube around the same time (most notably &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot;, both of which were also made by Nintendo) resulted in it being categorized as a rather throwaway title. In Japan, four critics from &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game a total score of 34 out of 40.

<doc id="815100" wikidata="Q3278786" url="?curid=815100" title="Mega Man Anniversary Collection">
<text>Mega Man Anniversary Collection is a compilation of video games developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and published by Capcom. It was released in North America on June 23, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube and on March 15, 2005 for the Xbox. The &quot;Anniversary Collection&quot; contains the first eight games in the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, which debuted on the NES with the first six games, moved to the Super NES with the seventh game, and moved to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with the eighth game, plus two bonus arcade games. The plot follows the robotic protagonist Mega Man in his continuing adventures battling the evil Dr. Wily and his army of Robot Masters. A similar set of compilations, &quot;Mega Man Legacy Collection&quot; and &quot;Mega Man Legacy Collection 2&quot;, were released in 2015 and 2017 respectively.

==Overview==

Each game has a similar structure in which the player traverses a series of themed stages to face off against boss robots, gain new weapons and abilities, then defeat Dr. Wily in a final confrontation. For the first six titles, an extra feature is the &quot;Navi Mode&quot;, originally introduced in the PlayStation (&quot;Rockman Complete Works&quot;) re-releases of the first six &quot;Mega Man&quot; games. Navi Mode adds helpers that provide game hints if the player is in need of help, revises the appearance of the health and weapon energy meters, and revises the weapon subscreens for the first three games. In addition to these eight games, the &quot;Anniversary Collection&quot; includes two unlockable arcade fighting games (&quot;Mega Man: The Power Battle&quot; and &quot;Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters&quot;), which had a limited release outside Japan. These two titles are similar in gameplay but a bit more streamlined. The battles cut straight to the bosses, who get progressively more difficult with each one defeated. 

Some of the games in the collection have minor differences compared to their original releases. Several of the NES games have remixed sound. In Mega Man 3 an misspelling of Dr. Willy&#x27;s name has been corrected. In &quot;Mega Man 6&quot;, the arranged music is incorrectly mastered and suffers from extensive peaking. The typo in Mr. X&#x27;s dialogue given upon defeating him has been corrected. In &quot;Mega Man 7&quot;, an instance of the word &quot;damn&quot; was changed to &quot;darn&quot; in order to maintain an all-ages rating. In addition, the graphics of Mega Man walking away from Wily&#x27;s Castle are absent from the credits sequence, as the developers were unable to port certain SNES graphical effects. In the compilation&#x27;s version of &quot;Mega Man 8&quot;, some of the Robot Masters&#x27; voice clips play at incorrect pitches. The PlayStation version of &quot;Mega Man 8&quot; is used, as opposed to the Sega Saturn version which included bonus features and additional boss battles.

Other unlockable elements in the &quot;Anniversary Collection&quot; include original art, remixed music, and bonus videos: The PS2 version features the pilot episode of the Ruby-Spears &quot;Mega Man&quot; TV series, while the GameCube and Xbox versions feature the &quot;Mega Man&quot; episode of G4&#x27;s &quot;Icons&quot;. The Xbox version also includes the first episode of &quot;Mega Man NT Warrior&quot; (based on the &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; game series) and the ability to change the control scheme. The PS2 and Xbox versions include some arranged music for the first six games, also originally present in the &quot;Complete Works&quot; versions.

==Development==
&quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot; shares qualities with &quot;Rockman Complete Works&quot;, a lineup of remakes of the first six games in the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, released for the PlayStation in Japan in late 1999. The six games were released individually, each disc containing a port of the original Famicom version as the game&#x27;s &quot;Original Mode&quot; and several extras. A &quot;Navi Mode&quot; was included, featuring a hint system in which a supporting character in each title gives tips to the player via a communicator, as well an updated HUD, an arranged soundtrack, and other optional game modes.

A Game Boy Advance version of &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot; was also in development and was originally due to be released concurrently with the PS2, GameCube, and Xbox incarnations. The game, originally announced as Mega Man Mania, was to feature color versions of the five original Game Boy &quot;Mega Man&quot; games, as well as a history section and artwork gallery. The game had its release date pushed back several times, with the delay rumored to be caused by Capcom lacking the games&#x27; original source code. In January 2006, gamers contacting Capcom were told that the game had been placed on &quot;indefinite hold&quot;. Capcom also began issuing refund checks to those who had ordered the game directly through their online store. Around the same time, several retailers, such as GameStop, declared the game &quot;cancelled&quot; and issued refunds or store credits.

==Reception==

The collection received mostly positive reviews. The collection was slightly criticized for lacking somewhat in the extras department, and the GameCube version was criticized slightly more for not including the remixed audio for &quot;Mega Man 1&quot;-&quot;6&quot;. More controversial was the change in the GameCube edition&#x27;s controls, which saw its fire and jumping buttons reversed from their original NES configuration with no option to arrange them back making level progression much trickier as a result. Conversely, the exclusive extra in the PS2 and GameCube versions were both praised, with the GameCube version&#x27;s interview being favored. The Xbox version rated slightly better than the other two versions, because of its added exclusive content as well as the exclusive bonuses from the PS2 and GameCube versions. However, it was given a score of 8.0 (versus 8.5 for the other two versions) from IGN for arriving late, in addition to occasional graphical glitches depending on screen settings, which become more apparent when played on an Xbox 360.

&quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot; was a financial success. The PS2 and GameCube versions of &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot; sold a combined total of over 500,000 copies in less than six months of release. Due to the popularity of &quot;Anniversary Collection&quot; among fans of the series, Capcom followed up with &quot;Mega Man X Collection&quot;, a similar compilation consisting of games in the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series which was exclusively released in North America on January 10, 2006. Once again, Capcom followed up with &quot;Mega Man Zero Collection&quot;, a compilation of all the games from the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; series that was released in 2010 for the Nintendo DS. In 2015, Capcom released &quot;Mega Man Legacy Collection&quot;, which featured the 6 original games on the NES with bonus features and improved quality. In 2017, &quot;Mega Man Legacy Collection 2&quot; was released and featured &quot;7&quot; and &quot;8&quot;, plus &quot;9&quot; and &quot;10&quot;.

<doc id="815120" wikidata="Q891276" url="?curid=815120" title="Bold (band)">
<text>Bold (originally named Crippled Youth) is an American late 1980s youth crew hardcore band from Westchester County, New York, which, along with bands like Youth of Today and Side by Side, were a part of the Youth Crew and an influence in the late 80s straight edge hardcore scene. The band progressed to a more rock-oriented sound in its later years.

== History ==
=== 1985–1993: Original run ===
Originally called Crippled Youth, the band was formed in Katonah, New York, by Matt Warnke (vocals), Tim Brooks (bass) and Drew Thomas (drums). After a couple of shows with Matt singing and playing guitar, they recruited John &#x27;Zulu&#x27; Zuluaga on guitar, and Matt switched to just singing. They released a 7-inch EP entitled &quot;&#x27;Join The Fight&#x27;&quot; on the California label New Beginning in 1986 before switching to the name &quot;Bold&quot;. It was under this name that they recorded the 11-song LP &quot;Speak Out&quot;. The record was supposed to be released on California&#x27;s WishingWell Records, but was eventually released in 1988 on Revelation Records.

The band later recruited Tom Capone (Beyond/Shelter/Quicksand/etc.) on second guitar, and recorded a self-titled 3-song 7-inch in 1989, also on Revelation Records. The 7-inch is considered by many their best material, adding more melody to their straightforward hardcore sound. The 7-inch EP was re-issued on a 12-inch entitled &quot;&#x27;Looking Back&#x27;&quot; in 1993, with 2 bonus tracks.

=== 1996: Faux reunion ===
In 1996, Warnke formed a post-hardcore band with bassist Eddie McNamara, drummer Mark Shutdown and guitarist Chris Daley inspired by the Clash and Fugazi. Despite the band members believing it to be an entirely separate group from Bold, their debut headline show saw them billed as Bold and cover multiple Bold songs. According to McNamara in an article for NoEcho, this led to significant confusion and the members of the band clarifying during their performance they were not, in fact, Bold.

=== 2005–present: Reunion ===
Bold re-united in 2005 with Warnke on vocals, Capone on guitar, Brooks on bass and Vinny Panza on drums. John Porcelly, who periodically played with the band in the 1980s, later joined on second guitar. To coincide with the re-union, Revelation released the retrospective CD &quot;The Search: 1985–1989&quot;, which contains the band&#x27;s entire recorded output.

Warnke and Porcelly left in 2006, effectively breaking up the band. The band&#x27;s recordings from the period after they got back together, although allegedly completed, have yet to surface. A European tour with replacement members was planned for Summer 2007, but did not happen.

In June 2012, Bold played the EPIC Revelation Records 25 Year Anniversary shows at The Glasshouse in Pomona, California. Also on the bill were Youth of Today, Gorilla Biscuits, Sick of It All, Shai Hulud, No for an Answer, Statue and Underdog. During October of that same year, Bold took part in Revelation&#x27;s 25th Anniversary East Coast shows at Irving Plaza.

This Is Hardcore Fest 2014 was Bold&#x27;s most recent performance.

== Band-member notes ==

* Matt Warnke sang for a band called One-Sided War with Patrick from Citizens Arrest in the late 90s before forming Running Like Thieves (named after a Bold song) with John Biviano and Andy Guida of Supertouch, which put out two EPs on New Jersey&#x27;s LiveWire Records. Tim Brooks and Rhys Williams performed on the &quot;Same Time Next Year&quot; release. Matt has since quit the band and is currently fronting the re-united Bold.
* Drew Thomas formed Into Another with ex-Underdog singer Richie Birkenhead in 1990. They put out several records throughout the 90s, but have now broken up.

<text>John Jeremy Doyle, (born 4 January 1945), Australian jurist, was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia, the highest ranking court in the Australian State of South Australia, between 1995 and 2012.

==Early life and education==
Doyle was educated at Saint Ignatius College, South Australia, and was dux of the college in 1962. He went on to graduate in law from the University of Adelaide in 1966 and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1967, completing his studies in law at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1969.

==Career==
In the following year he was admitted to the bar in South Australia.

Before being elevated to the position of chief justice in 1995, Doyle served as the Solicitor-General of South Australia from 1986 to 1995, where he was highly regarded for his skills as an advocate, particularly in complex constitutional cases. On a number of occasions, most recently in 1998, speculation surfaced that he may become the first South Australian to be appointed to the High Court of Australia; however, an appointment never eventuated. He was a founding member of Hanson Chambers and, immediately prior to his move to the independent bar, was a partner at Adelaide law firm, Kelly &amp; Co. 

Doyle is a fervent supporter of the Norwood Football Club in the South Australian National Football League.

During his time as Chief Justice, Doyle was appointed as an Acting Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in 2000 to hear an appeal concerning the appointment of the then Northern Territory Chief Magistrate Hugh Bradley.

On 30 April 2012, Doyle announced his retirement as Chief Justice, which took effect on 22 June 2012. He was succeeded as Chief Justice by Chris Kourakis.

<doc id="815148" wikidata="Q1072125" url="?curid=815148" title="Chichijima">
<text>is the largest and most populous island in the Japanese archipelago of Bonin or Ogasawara Islands. Chichijima is about north of Iwo Jima. in size, the island is home to about 2,120 people . Connected to the mainland only by a day-long ferry that runs a few times a month, the island is nonetheless organized administratively as the seat of Ogasawara Village in the coterminous Ogasawara Subprefecture of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Together with the Volcano and Izu Islands, it makes up Japan&#x27;s Nanpō Islands.

Some Micronesian tools and carvings have been found elsewhere in the Bonins, but Chichijima was long uninhabited when it was rediscovered. Ignored by the Spanish, Dutch, and Japanese Empires for centuries, it was finally claimed by a passing British captain in 1828 and settled by an international group from the Kingdom of Hawaii two years later, the original nucleus of the Ōbeikei ethnic group. Britain subsequently yielded to Japanese claims and colonization of the island, which established two villages at Ōmura () and Ōgimura-Fukurosawa (). These were formally incorporated in 1940, just before the civilian population was forcibly evacuated to Honshu in 1944 during the end of the Second World War. After the Surrender of Japan, the United States Armed Forces occupied the islands for two decades, destroying Japanese homes and businesses and only allowing resettlement by the Ōbeikei. Following the resumption of Japanese control in 1968, Home Island Japanese rapidly became the majority again.

== Names ==
The Japanese names of the Bonin Islands are mostly based on family relationships, established by the 1675 expedition under Shimaya Ichizaemon and fully adopted in the 1870s after the onset of Japanese colonization. As the largest island in the chain, Chichijima () means &quot;Father Island&quot;. It is sometimes written Chichi Jima or Chichi-jima and is also sometimes incorrectly read as Chichishima or Chichitō, based on other pronunciations of the character for &quot;island&quot;.

Historically, Chichijima has also been known as Gracht, Graght, or Graft Island (, , or ) after a Dutch ship named for the Netherlands&#x27; urban canals; Peel Island after the British home secretary Robert Peel, later prime minister; and the Main Island (and by extension Bonin Island, Bonin Sima, etc.).

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Some Micronesian tools and carvings have been found on North Iwo Jima and elsewhere in the Bonins, but Chichijima was long uninhabited when it was rediscovered. The Japanese accounts of a discovery by a member of the Ogasawara clan of samuraithe source of the Bonin&#x27;s Japanese nameare now known to be false. Similarly, accounts that Chichijima was discovered by the Spanish explorer Bernardo de la Torre during his failed 1543 voyage are incorrect, De la Torre having at most seen a single island from the Hahajima group at the southern end of the Bonin chain and most likely not even that. Despite the Bonins lying near the northern return route used by the Spanish after , none are recorded landing or charting the islands with any certainty.

===Early history===
The first certain sighting of Chichijima was by the failed 1639 Dutch expedition sent in search of the phantom Islands of Gold and Silver under Matthijs Quast and his lieutenant Abel Tasman.

A Japanese merchant ship carrying mikan (a kind of tangerine) from Arida was blown off course around 10 December 1669 and shipwrecked on Hahajima 72 days later, about 20 February 1670. The captain dead, the remaining six crew rested, explored, and rebuilt their ship for 52 days and then left (around April 13) for Chichijima. They stayed there five or six days, visited Mukojima for a few days, and then reached Hachijojima in the Izu Islands eight days after that. Once back on Honshu at Shimoda, they reported their (re)discovery in detail to the bakufu. The shipwrights at Nagasaki were then specially permitted to build an ocean-going junk of the &quot;Chinese type&quot;, the &quot;Fukkokuju Maru&quot;. Shimaya Ichizaemon was allowed to use it to trade between Nagasaki and Tokyo for four years before being directed to undertake a secret mission to explore and chart the islands with a crew of about 30 in May 1674. The attempts in June 1674 and February 1675 both failed but after repairs and waiting for more favorable winds the reached the Bonins on April 29. After erecting a shrine and mapping the chain including Chichijima, Shimaya departed on June 5, reaching Tokyo with his maps and samples of the soil, plants, and animals that he had found. After notionally placing the islands under the jurisdiction of Izu, the sakoku isolationist policy was resumed: the crew was disbanded, the junk broken up, and no further activity was taken or allowed with the islands. (It remained uninhabited until 1830.)

Western explorers visited the island on at least two occasions in the early 19th century. Frederick William Beechey&#x27;s Pacific expedition on HMS &quot;Blossom&quot; in 1827, and Heinrich von Kittlitz in 1828 with the Russian &quot;Senjawin&quot; expedition, led by Captain Fyodor Petrovich Litke. Two shipwrecked sailors who were picked up by Beechey suggested that the island would make a good stopover station for whalers due to natural springs found on the island.

The first settlement was established in May 1830, by a group formed in Hawaii (which was officially an independent kingdom at the time). The settlers were initially led by Matteo Mazzaro, an Italian-born British subject, included 13 indigenous Hawaiians (from Oahu), another Briton, two US citizens, and a Dane. The UK consul in Hawaii, Richard Charlton, accompanied the group to &quot;Peel Island&quot;, and returned immediately to Hawaii; no evidence has been found that the settlement was officially gazetted as an official UK territory. By 1840, following a power struggle between Mazzaro and Nathaniel Savory, a mariner from Massachusetts, de facto leadership of the settlers passed to Savory. The original settlers were gradually joined by other Americans, Europeans and Pacific Islanders.

Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s flagship USS &quot;Susquehanna&quot; anchored for three days in Chichijima&#x27;s harbor on 15 June 1853, on the way to his historic visit to Tokyo Bay to open up the country to western trade. Perry also laid claim to the island for the United States for a coaling station for steamships, appointing Nathaniel Savory as an official agent of the US Navy and formed a governing council with Savory as the leader. On behalf of the US government, Perry &quot;purchased&quot; from Savory.

In 1854, naturalist William Stimpson of the Rodgers-Ringgold North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition visited.

=== 1862 – 1941 ===
On 17 January 1862, at Chichijima, Japanese sovereignty over the Ogasawara Islands was proclaimed, following the arrival of an official party from the Tokugawa Shogunate. The existing inhabitants were allowed to remain, and Savory&#x27;s authority was acknowledged,

Ethnic Japanese gradually outnumbered descendants of the first wave of settlers, whom they referred to as &quot;Oubeikei&quot; (or &quot;Ōbeikei&quot;; literally &quot;Westerners&quot;). A unique mixed language, Bonin English, emerged on Chichijima, combining elements of Japanese with English and Hawaiian.

Following the Meiji restoration, a group of 37 Japanese colonists arrived on the island under the sponsorship of the Japanese Home Ministry in March 1876. The island was officially administered by Tokyo Metropolis on 28 October 1880.

A small naval base was established on Chichijima in 1914. Emperor Hirohito made an official visit in 1927, aboard the battleship .

=== World War II ===

The island was the primary site of long range Japanese radio stations during World War II, as well as being the central base of supply and communication between Japan and the Ogasawara Islands. It had the heaviest garrison in the Nanpō Shotō. According to one source: &quot;At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, an Army force of about 3,700-3,800 men garrisoned Chichi Jima. In addition, about 1,200 naval personnel manned the Chichi Jima Naval Base, a small seaplane base, the radio and weather station, and various gunboat, subchaser, and minesweeping units.&quot; The garrison also included a heavy artillery fortress regiment.

During the war, the &quot;Oubeikei&quot; were viewed with suspicion by the Japanese authorities, which saw them as potential spies. They were reportedly forced to take Japanese names. In 1944, all of the 6,886 civilian inhabitants were ordered to evacuate from the Ogasawara islands to the Home Islands, including the &quot;Oubeikei&quot;. (However, at least two US citizens of Japanese descent served in the Japanese military on Chichijima during the war, including Nobuaki &quot;Warren&quot; Iwatake, a Japanese-American from Hawaii who was drafted into the Japanese Imperial Army while living with his family in Hiroshima.)

Chichijima was a frequent target of US Navy air attacks. The future President George H. W. Bush was shot down while on one of these raids, and rescued from the sea. In the Chichijima incident of February 1945, US aviators who had been captured, were tortured, executed, and in cases, partially eaten. (The air raids became the subject of a book by James Bradley entitled &quot;&quot;.)

Japanese troops and resources from Chichijima were used in reinforcing the strategic point of Iwo Jima before the historic battle that took place there from 19 February to 24 March 1945. The island also served as a major point for Japanese radio relay communication and surveillance operations in the Pacific, with two radio stations atop its two mountains being the primary goal of multiple bombing attempts by the US Navy.

The island was never captured, and at the end of World War II, some 25,000 troops in the island chain surrendered. Thirty Japanese soldiers were court-martialled for class &quot;B&quot; war crimes, primarily in connection with the Chichijima incident and four officers (Major Matoba, General Tachibana, Admiral Mori, and Captain Yoshii) were found guilty and hanged. All enlisted men and Probationary Medical Officer Tadashi Teraki were released within eight years.

===United States occupation===
The United States maintained the former Japanese naval base and attached seaplane base after the war.

A majority of the pre-war civilian population was initially barred from returning by the SCAP, which allowed only 129 &quot;Oubeikei&quot; to return, in recognition of their mistreatment by the wartime Japanese authorities. Other houses on the island were destroyed.

Several occupied islands, including Chichijima, were used by the United States in the 1950s to store nuclear arms, according to Robert S. Norris, William M. Arkin, and William Burr, writing for the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; (in 2000). This was despite the Japanese Constitution being explicitly anti-war. Japan holds Three Non-Nuclear Principles.

In 1960, the harbor facilities were devastated by tsunami after the Great Chilean earthquake.

===Since 1968===
The island was returned to Japanese civilian control in 1968. At that time, the &quot;Oubeikei&quot; were allowed to choose either US or Japanese citizenship. Many of those who chose to move to the US continued to regularly return to the island, where some ran businesses during the summer tourist season.

By the early 21st century, almost 200 residents identifying as &quot;Americans&quot; and/or &quot;Oubeikei&quot; remained on the island.

==Topography and climate==
Chichijima is located at . Currently, around 2,000 people live on the island, and the island&#x27;s area is about .

On English maps from the early 19th century, the island chain was known as the Bonin Islands. The name Bonin comes from a French cartographer&#x27;s corruption of the old Japanese word &#x27;munin&#x27;, which means &#x27;no man&#x27;, and the English translated it to &quot;No mans land&quot; islands.

The climate of Chichijima is on the boundary between a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;), a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;), and a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). Temperatures are warm to hot and humid all year round, and have certainly remained between owing to the warm currents from the North Pacific gyre that surround the island. Rainfall is, however, less heavy than in most parts of mainland Japan, since the island is too far south to be influenced by the Aleutian Low and too far from mainland Asia to receive monsoonal rainfall or orographic precipitation on the equatorward side of the Siberian High. Occasionally, very heavy cyclonic rain falls, as on 7 November 1997, when the island received its record daily rainfall of and monthly rainfall of .

==Island development==
===Astronomy and telemetry stations===
The Japanese National Institute of Natural Sciences (NINS) is the umbrella agency maintaining a radio astronomy facility on Chichijima. Since 2004, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) has been a division of NINS. The NINS/NAQJ research is on-going using a VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy (VERA) radio telescope. The dual-beam VERA array consists of four coordinated radio telescope stations located at Mizusawa, Iriki, Ishigakijima, and Ogasawara. The combined signals of the four-part array produce a correlated image which is used for deep space study.

Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency also maintains a facility on Chichijima. The Ogasawara Downrange Station at Kuwanokiyama was established in 1975 as a National Space Development Agency of Japan facility. The station is equipped with radar (rocket telemeter antenna and precision radar antenna) to check the flight trajectories, status, and safety of rockets launched from the Tanegashima Space Center.

===JMSDF facilities===
From 1968, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) has operated the Chichijima Naval Base, along with the associated Chichijima Airfield, the latter including a heliport originally built during the American occupation, as well as seaplane facilities.

==Wildlife==
===Birds===
Possibly as a result of the introduction of nonindigenous animals, at least three species of birds became extinct: the Bonin nankeen night heron, the Bonin grosbeak (a finch), and the Bonin thrush. The island was the only known home of the thrush and probably the finch, although the heron was found on Nakōdo-jima (also &quot;Nakoudo-&quot; or &quot;Nakondo-&quot;), as well. The existence of the birds was documented by von Kittlitz in 1828, and five stuffed thrushes are in European museums. The Bonin wood-pigeon died out in the late 19th century, apparently as the result of the introduction of alien mammals. The species is known to have existed only on Chichijima and another island, Nakōdo-jima. Chichijima, together with neighbouring Anijima and Ototojima, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Japanese wood pigeons and Bonin white-eyes.

===Green turtle consumption and preservation===

The inhabitants of the island traditionally have caught and consumed green turtles as a source of protein. Local restaurants serve turtle soup and sashimi in dishes. In the early 20th century, some 1000 turtles were captured per year and the population of turtles decreased. Today in Chichijima, only one fisherman is allowed to catch turtles and the number taken is restricted to at most 135 per season.

The Fisheries Agency and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government operate a conservation facility on the edge of Futami Harbor. Eggs are carefully planted in the shore and infant turtles are raised at the facility until they have reached a certain size, at which point they are released into the wild with an identification tag. Today, the number of green turtles has been stabilized and is increasing slowly.

==Demographics==
The original settlers were of Western and Polynesian origin. Their descendants are now known as &quot;Obeikei&quot; and have Western and Japanese names; they were required to have the latter since World War II. , most residents were of Yamato Japanese who came to the island after Japan took back control from the US in the 1970s.

==Education==

Ogasawara Village operates the island&#x27;s public elementary and junior high schools.
* Ogasawara Municipal Ogasawara Junior High School (小笠原村立小笠原中学校)
* Ogasawara Elementary School (小笠原小学校)

Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education operates Ogasawara High School on Chichijima.

<text>The Akbash () is a traditional Turkish breed or type of flock guardian dog from western Anatolia. The word means &#x27;white head&#x27;, and thus distinguishes this dog from the Karabaş, or &#x27;black head&#x27;. It was recognised by the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in 2006; it is under the tutelage of the , the Turkish dog breed society, but is not recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

== History ==

The Akbash is a traditional breed of livestock guardian dog, used to protect flocks from predators in the rugged terrain of western Anatolia. It is distributed mainly in the provinces of Afyon, Ankara, Eskişehir and Manisa; some are present in the provinces of Ağrı, Konya, Sivas and Tunceli.

A standard was published by the Turkish Standards Institution in 2002, and in 2006 the Akbash was recognised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs; it was added to the list of recognised native breeds and types, and the breed standard was published in the &quot;Resmi Gazete&quot;, the official government gazette.

== Characteristics ==

The Akbash is a flock guardian dog, providing protection from predators to shepherds and to their sheep; it does not have any herding ability. It is a large and powerful dog: mean body weight is approximately , and mean height at the withers just over .

The coat may be either long or of medium length; it is always double, and is usually white, though there may be some shading towards a biscuit colour. As with other white-coated flock guardian dogs, the white coat makes it easy for the shepherd to distinguish between the dog and a predator, even in the dark. There is considerable feathering behind the legs, and the tail is heavily feathered.

<text>Walldorf (; South Franconian: &quot;Walldoaf&quot;) is a town in the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis district in the state of Baden-Württemberg in Germany.

In the eighteenth century, Walldorf was the birthplace of John Jacob Astor, who emigrated and became a prominent fur trader in the newly independent United States, establishing a monopoly in North America. Concentrating on real estate acquisition and investment, and based in New York City, he grew even wealthier and was the patriarch of the wealthy and influential Astor family.

Walldorf is home to the world&#x27;s fifth largest software company, SAP.

==Geography==
The neighbouring town to the southeast is Wiesloch. The towns are strongly linked economically. Adjacent municipalities are Sandhausen, Leimen, Nußloch, St. Leon-Rot and Reilingen. The train station, named &quot;Wiesloch-Walldorf&quot;, is located between the two towns.

==History==
Hallstatt-culture barrows are preserved in the Hochholz woods, near the offices of SAP Deutschland. The earliest documentary mention of the settlement occurs as Waltorf in a 770 deed issued by the Abbey of Lorsch. The Electorate of the Palatinate received Walldorf as an Imperial fief in 1230. The town suffered much during the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618–1648, and in 1689 was completely destroyed in the course of the French invasion during Nine Years&#x27; War. The area was settled anew by religious refugees, among them the predecessors of John Jacob Astor, Waldensians from Piedmont.

During the German Mediatisation, Walldorf fell to Baden. In 1843 the Rheintalbahn was built: this railway decisively promoted economic development. In 1901 Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden granted Walldorf town privileges. After World War II the companies Heidelberger Druckmaschinen (founded 1850) and SAP (founded 1972; moved to Walldorf in 1977) were established in Walldorf.

==Politics==

Seats in the municipal assembly (&quot;Gemeinderat&quot;) as of 2024 elections:

* CDU (Christian Democratic Union): 7 (31,61%)
* SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany): 5 (22,70%)
* FDP (Free Democratic Party): 5 (21,98%)
* Grüne (Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens): 4 (18,79%)
* Zusammen für Walldorf (Together for Walldorf): 1 (4,91%)

==Economy==

SAP SE has had its headquarters in the city since 1977. It is Europe&#x27;s most valuable brand, as well as the largest non-American software enterprise by revenue.

== Twin cities ==
* Astoria, Oregon, United States, since 1963
* Kırklareli, Turkey, since 1970
* Saint-Max, France, since 1985
* Waldorf, Maryland, United States, since 2002
* Freeport, New York, United States, since 2003

==Sights==
The &quot;Astorhaus&quot; was built in 1854, from a pecuniary legacy of the deceased John Jacob Astor to his hometown. For decades, it served as an almshouse, and now hosts the register office and a museum.

The 19th-century synagogue was devastated in the 1938 &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; attacks and most of the congregation was killed in the Holocaust. The building is now used as a New Apostolic Church.

Walldorf is known for cultivating white asparagus, which is available in the months of April through June.

<text>The Guardian Angels is a non-profit international volunteer organization with the goal of unarmed crime prevention. The Guardian Angels organization was founded on February 14, 1979, in New York City, by Curtis Sliwa. Since then, it has expanded to more than 130 cities and 14 countries worldwide.

Sliwa originally created the Guardian Angels to combat widespread violence and crime on the New York City Subway system. The organization originally trained members to make citizen&#x27;s arrests for violent crimes. They patrolled streets and neighborhoods without involving police or any outside authority, but also provided educational programs for schools and businesses.

==History==

In the beginning, New York City Mayor Ed Koch publicly opposed the group. Over the years, the controversy has diminished. As citizen involvement and outreach have increased, there has been less public opposition to the group by administration officials. Koch later reversed his stance on the organization, and former New York City Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg have publicly supported the group.

==Rules and activities==
The original and main Guardian Angels activity is &quot;safety patrol&quot; in which members walk the streets or ride transit. Guardian Angels must be in uniform to represent the organization. They can be identified by their red berets and red jackets, or white T-shirts with the red Guardian Angels logo of an eye inside a pyramid on a winged shield.

Chapters operate similarly to franchise networks, by supporting one another regionally under standard rules, regulations, and training. The Guardian Angels state that it is an equal opportunity organization that encourages diversity.

The organization accepts volunteers who have no recent or serious criminal record and are not members of a gang or racial-hate group. To join the safety patrol program, members must be at least 16 years old; youth programs for younger applicants are offered. Safety Patrol members are prohibited from carrying weapons and are physically searched by each other before patrolling. They are trained in first aid, CPR, law, conflict resolution, communication, and basic martial arts. Members are paired up and follow the directions of a patrol leader. If their own or other citizens&#x27; lives or health are endangered, they are allowed to do whatever is lawful and necessary.

The Guardian Angels have also begun to include youth programs, teacher programs, disaster response, an Internet safety program called the CyberAngels, and self-defense courses, as well as community outreach program to address issues beyond crime.

The Guardian Angels do not demand or ask for money on the subway.

In the 1980s when they were often seen on the subways, imitators would dress in clothing similar to the Guardian Angels&#x27; characteristic dress (including red berets) to impersonate them and solicit money.

===CyberAngels===
CyberAngels was founded in 1995 by Colin Gabriel Hatcher as an online &quot;neighborhood watch.&quot; Originally, the group monitored chat rooms directly with the intent of apprehending sexual predators. Later, the group took what it had learned and changed its focus to educating police, schools, and families about online abuse and cybercrime. In 1998, CyberAngels received a Presidential Service Award. MacSupport.com founder Tony Ricciardi was an early member of the group.

==Chapters==

Outside of New York City, the Guardian Angels first established chapters in Washington, D.C., New Orleans, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Fresno, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Denver, London, Toronto, Dallas, Tokyo, Houston, Cape Town, Auckland, Savannah, Seattle, and York. Subsequently, the organization established chapters in smaller cities, such as the cities of Springfield and Brockton, Massachusetts; Sacramento and Stockton, California; and Portland, Maine. In May 2011, a chapter was organized in Indianapolis. The Los Angeles, York, Pennsylvania, and Sacramento Chapters worked with official law enforcement officers and agencies.

The Tampa Bay region of Florida has had two Guardian Angels chapters. The first Tampa chapter was established in 1984 and lasted until 1992. A second chapter was established in 1999. In 2017, when the Seminole Heights serial killer was active, the Tampa Bay chapter patrolled the streets of the Seminole Heights neighborhood.

The Guardian Angels have been active in Orlando, Florida, due to the increase in murder and crime rates.

In 2016, the Washington, D.C. chapter announced they would increase their presence on the Washington Metro following an increase in violent crime.

==Outside the United States==
===Australia===

A Guardian Angels chapter actively patrolled in Sydney in the early nineties but disbanded shortly.

A chapter was formed in Canberra, the capital city of Australia in 2008. Some school and internet-safety programs were conducted before the chapter was closed.

In 2017, a branch was formed in the city of Logan in Queensland. They started patrolling local parks but have since been patrolling the streets and other public places. In 2019, Guardian Angels began patrols in Melbourne and closed 12 months later in 2020.

===Canada===

A Toronto chapter was originally formed in 1982 and ran until 1984. A smaller chapter ran briefly in the Parkdale area of Toronto in 1992–1993 but disbanded. The 2005 Boxing Day shooting resulted in the death of teenager Jane Creba on a busy downtown street and provoked renewed attention to law-and-order issues in Canada. Curtis Sliwa stated that he had been contacted by many Torontonians interested in having a local chapter. On July 13, 2006, a new chapter of the Guardian Angels Canada was formed in Toronto. However, both mayor David Miller and police chief Bill Blair stated they were not interested in trying what had not worked twice before. When Sliwa arrived with three other Angels, Miller declined to meet with them, stating that police work was best left to the police. Despite the opposition of the mayor, community groups, and the police chief, the Toronto Chapter moved ahead. 2006 mayoral candidate Jane Pitfield expressed her support for the Guardian Angels, as did former television anchor Peter Kent and former professional boxer (and now radio talk show host) Spider Jones. Toronto&#x27;s first group of Guardian Angels hit the streets Thursday, July 13 for their inaugural patrol in the city&#x27;s downtown core. The group&#x27;s official launch in Toronto came just two days after members were forced to move their graduation ceremony from a seniors residence on Dundas Street.

A Vancouver chapter was in operation as of November 2006. There was a chapter there in the early 1980s. Some of the alumni from that group are assisting with the new chapter.

An attempt to organize a chapter in Ottawa failed due to police and city refusing to cooperate, as well as a negative reaction and lack of interest from the majority of its population.

A Calgary chapter was set up, with the first group finishing its training in March 2007.

A Halifax chapter is in operation as of May 2008. Recent outbreaks of violent crime in Halifax had prompted citizens to contact the Guardian Angels, urging them to start a chapter.

As of 2024, there is no record of active chapters in Canada.

===Germany===
In 1993, local Guardian Angels were founded in several German cities like Berlin and Hamburg to patrol the local S-Bahn and U-Bahn facilities. Currently, the Guardian Angels are still active in Hanover and have been renamed &quot;Schutzengel&quot;, which is the German translation of the English denomination.

===Japan===
A local organization of the Guardian Angels was formed in Japan in 1996. The Guardian Angels Japan has chapters in most of the major cities and is second only to America in membership and activities. Keiji Oda, the founder and president of the Guardian Angels Japan, joined the Boston and New York City chapters in the 1980s. The Guardian Angels concept faced opposition in Japan, but Oda succeeded in convincing Japanese officials that the organization would be run by Japanese members for the Japanese people, and the principles of the organization were not just American but universal. Official acceptance culminated with a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in 2005. The Guardian Angels were the first community organization in Japan to be awarded non-profit status.

===Mexico===
In 2007, a chapter formed in Mexico City led by the Canadian professional wrestler Vampiro.

===New Zealand===

In January 2006, the Guardian Angels opened its New Zealand Headquarters in Henderson, a suburb of West Auckland, New Zealand. The New Zealand National Director was Andy &quot;Chieftain&quot; Cawston.

New Zealand&#x27;s inaugural Guardian Angels Patrol was held on January 13, 2006. The Guardian Angels were active in South Auckland for a short while.

On August 30, 2007, Curtis Sliwa graduated from the Auckland CBD Chapter, led by Anna &quot;Kimodo&quot; Cruse. This Chapter&#x27;s first official patrol was the following evening.

Members of the Wellington Chapter held their inaugural training and orientation Patrol on October 6, 2006, in the Auckland CBD.

Within New Zealand, The International Alliance of Guardian Angels was recognized and registered as a Charitable Trust for tax purposes. Their headquarters were in the Waitakere Community Center, Ratanui Street, Henderson. In 2016 the New Zealand chapters disbanded.

===The Philippines===

Cybertanod, Role Model Cop, and the Barangay PeaceKeeping Action Team (BPAT) program of The Philippine National Police are some of the contributions of The Guardian Angels Philippines Chapter in Police organization. Joint police programs of the Guardian Angels resulted in national awards for officers and local police stations where the Guardian Angels work. The chapter covered Southern Mindanao and recently expanded into Northern Luzon. Today, the Philippines Chapter aims to spread the program in the Southeast Asia region and is currently developing an independent Citizen Police Organization concept for the region. The local chapter gathers support to host the 1st Joint Police and Guardian Angels Annual International Citizen Safety Patrol as its beyond border initiatives on Guardian Angels violence prevention — Global Public Safety awareness campaign. The effort in Southeast Asia is under the watch of Mike Zarate as National Director for Philippines.

===South Africa===
The Guardian Angels South African Chapter was started by Carl Viljoen in 2004 in Cape Town. Other chapters are in Kuilsrivier in the Western Cape and Potchefstroom, North West Province.

===United Kingdom===

In London, the Guardian Angels are an independent, non-profit, non-political voluntary organization whose main purpose is to tackle violent crime, act as positive role models for young people, and serve communities in the UK since its formation on May 14, 1989. By 2007, their main numbers had dwindled to almost zero. In the United Kingdom, the law requires that people use only &quot;reasonable force&quot; as appropriate to the situation, which leads Guardian Angel training to focus on using the minimum possible force and only to use force to prevent a dangerous situation from escalating. All violent crimes are reported to the police, and intervention leading to citizens&#x27; arrests (legal in Britain) or use of force is only employed in extreme cases. Guardian Angels in the UK are unarmed but all fully trained in self-defence, first aid, and law for personal and community protection.

The London Chapter seemed dormant for several years.

==Controversies==
In 1992, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa issued a public apology for faking several subway rescues in the 1980s in order to get publicity for the group.

In October 2020, various individuals running for the New York City Council expressed concerns that the presence of the Guardian Angels might bring tensions to their neighborhoods.

In February 2021, Patrick Bobilin, a candidate for the New York State Assembly, posted a video to Twitter showing members of the Guardian Angels allegedly harassing and attacking protesters, including Bobilin, as they returned from a Stonewall Inn protest.

In February 2024, several members of the Guardian Angels shoved a man to the sidewalk and put him in a headlock during a live interview with Sliwa at Times Square. During the interview, which came a week after a widely publicized brawl between several migrants and NYPD officers, Sliwa stated that the man was a migrant. He also stated that the man had been caught shoplifting. In a later segment, he added &quot;[...] Let&#x27;s just say we gave him a little pain compliance, his mother back in Venezuela felt the vibrations. He&#x27;s sucking concrete, the cops scraped him off the asphalt[...]&quot; The NYPD later said the man was actually from the Bronx, and they did not provide evidence of the man shoplifting. Sliwa told The Associated Press he believed the man was a migrant because he spoke Spanish and had been encountered with other Spanish speakers on patrols. The man was issued a summons for disorderly conduct.

<text>The Automobile Club of Southern California is the Southern California affiliate of the American Automobile Association (AAA) federation of motor clubs. The Auto Club was founded on December 13, 1900, in Los Angeles as one of the nation&#x27;s first motor clubs dedicated to improving roads, proposing traffic laws, and improvement of overall driving conditions. Today, it is the single largest member of the AAA federation, with almost 8 million members in its home territory of Southern California, more than 16 million members across all subsidiaries in 21 states, and an annual budget in excess of $2 billion.

==History==

===Early years===

The Auto Club was an early advocate for the construction of the Ridge Route, the first highway through the Tehachapi Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains, which directly linked Los Angeles to Bakersfield and the Central Valley. The completion of the Ridge Route greatly facilitated automobile travel through this significant mountain barrier.

Starting around 1910, the Auto Club sent teams of cartographers to survey the state&#x27;s roads for the production of maps and to create a uniform signing system. The Auto Club posted thousands of porcelain-on-steel traffic signs throughout the state and continued to do so until the State of California took over the task in the mid-1950s. The signs were produced by a local company that manufactured porcelain-on-steel bathtubs. A few of these signs remain in service today, though they are extremely rare.

In 1923, the Auto Club&#x27;s main office on the corner of Figueroa Street and Adams Boulevard in the West Adams district was completed. Architects Sumner P. Hunt and Silas R. Burns designed a building of &quot;attractive Spanish design&quot; that was a &quot;distinctive structure for the West Adams district&quot;. On February 3, 1971, the building became Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #71. The building now serves as the Los Angeles branch office. The club&#x27;s headquarters are still in Los Angeles but its administrative offices are in Costa Mesa.

From 1934 through 1941, the building&#x27;s courtyard served as the site of the Auto Club&#x27;s annual &quot;Outing Show,&quot; which promoted motor vacations and camping. These events were halted after the start of the war and were never revived. During the course of the war, the Auto Club played a leadership role in scrap rubber and metal drives and printed numerous posters for the war effort, including the &quot;Give Them a Lift&quot; campaign, which encouraged motorists to give rides to hitchhiking servicemen.

The Auto Club has also experienced its share of scandals. In 1970, the Auto Club incurred the wrath of Los Angeles city councilman Marvin Braude when it opposed an initiative that would have authorized diversion of state fuel tax revenues away from road construction to reducing smog and expanding mass transit. Braude ran for the Auto Club&#x27;s board the next year and lost, then promptly sued the Auto Club over alleged unfairness in its election procedures that enabled the incumbent board to make itself self-perpetuating. His lawsuit dragged on for over 15 years and involved three trials and three appeals, all of which Braude ultimately won. In the end, the Auto Club was forced to revise its election procedures to give board outsiders a better chance of actually winning seats, and it was ordered to pay Braude&#x27;s attorney&#x27;s fees. Furthermore, the &quot;Braude&quot; case revealed that the Auto Club had been exploiting several loopholes in California corporate law, which caused the state Legislature to enact a comprehensive revision of the California Nonprofit Corporation Law in 1978.

===Recent years===
Today, the Automobile Club of Southern California&#x27;s affiliated insurance company, the Interinsurance Exchange of the Auto Club, is one of California&#x27;s largest insurers. It provides coverage for automobiles, homes, recreational vehicles, motorcycles and watercraft. It also provides umbrella (liability) insurance. It is organized as a reciprocal inter-insurance exchange rather than as a conventional insurance company.

The Auto Club is the largest member of the AAA federation. The Auto Club is still a membership organization, and provides as a member benefit maps, travel planning, emergency roadside service, and DMV services. Members also receive &quot;Westways,&quot; a magazine devoted to travel and automotive subjects. Branch offices stretch from Chula Vista, near the international border with Mexico, to the small town of Bishop, in California&#x27;s eastern Sierra mountains.

====AAA expansion program====
In 1996, the Auto Club began an expansion program that involved the purchase of or affiliation with several other AAA motor clubs across the country by acquiring AAA Hawaii, AAA New Mexico, and AAA Texas. It went on to affiliate with AAA Northern New England (serving New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine) in 2003 and AAA Missouri (serving Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and portions of Illinois and Indiana) in 2006. AAA Alabama was acquired in 2007. The Auto Club later affiliated with AAA East Central (serving portions of Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia); it affiliated with AAA Tidewater in 2012.

====Other affiliated programs====
From Central California northward, the California State Automobile Association, now called AAA Northern California, Nevada &amp; Utah, provides services to ACSC members who travel north. AAA Northern California and ACSC are both members of the AAA federation of motor clubs. While membership is not interchangeable among AAA clubs, each club provides certain services to all AAA members on a reciprocal basis, notably roadside assistance.

In recent years, the Auto Club has returned to its roots with involvement in auto racing, sponsoring the annual Auto Club 400 NASCAR Cup Series race in Fontana and NHRA Auto Club Finals in Pomona. The tracks where both events are held (Auto Club Speedway and Auto Club Raceway at Pomona, respectively), along with a drag strip in Bakersfield (Auto Club Famoso Raceway), all had naming rights held by the Auto Club.

The Auto Club sponsors Team Penske driver Joey Logano&#x27;s No. 22 Ford at the NASCAR Cup Series race in Fontana. The Auto Club also sponsors the NHRA funny car team John Force Racing and its driver Robert Hight. When the IndyCar Series ran at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, Hélio Castroneves ran an Auto Club livery from 2012 to 2015. Castroneves is also a Team Penske driver.

<doc id="815227" wikidata="Q15524743" url="?curid=815227" title="Hargrave Jennings">
<text>Hargrave Jennings (1817–1890) was a British Freemason, Rosicrucian, author on occultism and esotericism, and amateur student of comparative religion.

Jennings was a member of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and was involved with a Pagan group inspired by &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;.

==Phallism and phallicism==

In several voluminous works, Jennings developed the theory that the origin of all religion is to be sought in phallic worship of the Sun and fire, which he described as &quot;phallism.&quot;

In addition to the works to which he affixed his own name, Jennings is thought by some researchers to have written a number of anonymous volumes in the privately printed &quot;Nature Worship and Mystical Series&quot; series, and possibly also to have written under the pseudonym &quot;Sha Rocco.&quot;

As Jennings made clear in several of his books, he used the word &quot;phallic&quot; in its non-gendered sense, meaning &quot;having to do with the sexual organs&quot;; thus he included worship of the female genitalia under the heading of &quot;phallic.&quot; In later editions he reluctantly acceded to popular (although incorrect) usage and called his subject &quot;phallicism.&quot;

== Criticism == 
Madame Blavatsky disagreed with Jennings&#x27; thesis of phallicism being the origin of all religion.

Blavatsky writes, 
She suggests her own thesis of the birth of phallicism. However she also praised highly his earlier book The Rosicrucians, as well as paying him due credit with such quotes as:

==Works==
* &quot;Indian Religions, or Results of the Mysterious Buddhism&quot; (1858)
* &quot;Curious Things of the Outside World: Last Fire&quot; (1861)
* &quot;The Rosicrucians: Their Rites and Mysteries&quot; (1870)
* &quot;Live Lights and Dead Lights (1873), One of the Thirty, a Strange History&quot; (1873)
* &quot;The Obelisk: Notices of the Origin, Purpose and History of Obelisks&quot; (1877)
* &quot;Childishness and Brutality of the Time&quot; (1883)
* &quot;Phallicism, Celestial and Terrestrial, Heathen and Christian&quot; (1884)
* &quot;Charon: Sermons from the Styx: a Posthumous Work by Frederick the Great&quot; (1886)
* &quot;Phallic Objects, Monuments and Remains&quot; (1889)

===As Sha Rocco===
* &quot;The Masculine Cross and Ancient Sex Worship&quot; 1874; reprinted in the &quot;Nature Worship and Mystical Series&quot; 1890
* &quot;Sex Mythology&quot; 1898 (This was published after Jennings&#x27; death, but may be a reprint of earlier writings.)

===Anonymous &quot;Nature Worship and Mystical Series&quot;===
* &quot;Phallic Worship&quot; (1880)
* &quot;Phallism: A Description of the Worship of Lingam-Yoni&quot; (1889) Reprinted as &quot;Phallicism&quot; (ca. 1890-91)
* &quot;Ophiolatreia: An Account of the Rites and Mysteries Connected with the Origin, Rise, and Development of Serpent Worship&quot; (1889)
* &quot;Phallic Objects, Monuments, and Remains&quot; (1889)
* &quot;Cultus Arborum: A Descriptive Account of Phallic Tree Worship&quot; (1890)
* &quot;Fishes, Flowers, and Fire as Elements and Deities in the Phallic Faiths and Worship&quot; (1890)
* &quot;Archaic Rock Inscriptions: an Account of the Cup and Ring Marking&quot; (1890)
* &quot;Nature Worship: An Account of Phallic Faiths and Practices&quot; (1891)
* &quot;Phallic Miscellanies: Facts and Phases of Ancient and Modern Sex Worship, as Explained Chiefly in the Religions of India&quot; (1891)
* &quot;Mysteries of the Rosie Cross, or the History of that Curious Sect of the Middle Ages, known as the Rosicrucians&quot; (1891)

<text>Kolding () is a Danish seaport located at the head of Kolding Fjord in the Region of Southern Denmark. It is the seat of Kolding Municipality. It is a transportation, commercial, and manufacturing centre and has numerous industrial companies, principally geared towards shipbuilding. The manufacturing of machinery and textiles and livestock export are other economically significant activities.

With a population of 94,932 (1 January 2024), the Kolding municipality is the eleventh most populous in Denmark. The city itself has a population of 62,444 (1 January 2024) and is the eighth largest city in Denmark.

The city is part of the Triangle Region, which includes the neighbouring cities of Fredericia and Vejle.

==History==
Koldinghus would be besieged and presumably occupied by Holstein in 1369.

In the Battle of Kolding, fought on 25 December 1658, the allied Polish and Danish forces under hetman Stefan Czarniecki defeated the Swedish forces of Charles X Gustav of Sweden.

A battle between German and Danish forces took place near the town on 23 April 1849 during the First War of Schleswig.

On 9 September, 1955, Kolding was impacted by a high-end F2/T5 Tornado that displaced a car 20 meters into a yard.

On 3 November 2004, the N. P. Johnsen&#x27;s Fireworks Factory in the suburb of Seest exploded. One firefighter died, 85 people were injured, around 2,000 people were evacuated, and some of them lost their homes during this disaster.

==Overview==
Located in Kolding is the former royal castle of Koldinghus. This was built in the 13th century by King Eric Klipping and is a museum with certain parts of the castle, including its chapel and hall, being used for governmental ceremonial events. It was the last royal residence in Jutland. Another notable site is the 13th century stone Church of Saint Nicholas (), which is one of the oldest in Denmark.

===Main sights===
The municipal museum, the Museet på Koldinghus, is located in the castle and former royal palace. It has a collection of Danish art from the late Middle Ages to the 1940s, miscellaneous artefacts of local interest, and an extensive collection of items in gold and silver.

The Trapholt art museum features many pieces primarily by Danish artists in its collections of arts from 1900 onwards and a smaller number of non-Danish exhibits. It also features a large collection of chairs.

Botanical garden Geografisk Have is a 14 hectares large park with more than 2,000 different trees, bushes, and plants organised in geographical areas.

Also Kolding houses the Danish Museum of Nurses (), which is situated in the reception building of the former tuberculosis sanatorium for children. The exhibition also include this past of the buildings. The main part of the sanatorium is now a hotel, situated in a minor forest and overlooking the water. The building itself is very beautiful and built to resemble a palace.
==Education ==
A branch of University College South () can be found in Kolding.

A branch campus of University of Southern Denmark () is located in the former hospital which was closed in 1975. The new &quot;Campus Kolding&quot; opened downtown in 2014. The new building of University of Southern Denmark will be built further to the east at Grønborggrunden in central Kolding.

Kolding is also home to Design School Kolding (&quot;Designskolen Kolding&quot;), a university design school, which was established in 1967 to provide undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the areas of fashion, graphic design and textiles.

<doc id="815253" wikidata="Q7692967" url="?curid=815253" title="Ted Arnott">
<text>Theodore Calvin Arnott (born April 8, 1963) is a Canadian politician who was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on September 6, 1990, representing the Riding of Wellington. He is a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario and represented the Riding of Wellington—Halton Hills in the Ontario Legislature. Arnott served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario during the 42nd and 43rd Parliaments of Ontario.

In 2022, Arnott became the longest-serving member of the Ontario Legislature following the retirement of Jim Wilson and the defeat of Gilles Bisson. He is only member of the legislature who has continuously served since the 1990 Ontario general election and the premiership of Bob Rae. He retired in 2025.

==Background==
Ted Arnott was born in 1963 in Fergus, Ontario. He grew up in Arthur, Ontario, where his family was in the engineering construction business. While attending school, he had a newspaper delivery route at the age of 9, and later worked part time as a retail store clerk, a construction labourer, and a factory worker. He also played minor hockey, lacrosse, and later tennis.

In 1979, he received recognition from the Order of St. John of Jerusalem for rendering &quot;assistance which was instrumental in saving the life of a drowning man&quot; at the Rockwood Conservation Area on August 20, 1978, receiving the honour from the Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police, Harold H. Graham.

After graduating from Arthur District High School, he attended Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree, with a major in political science, and later receiving a Diploma in Business Administration. From 1987 to 1990, he was Executive Assistant to Jack Johnson, MPP for the Riding of Wellington and Chair of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Caucus.

Married in 1990, he and his wife Lisa live in Fergus, Ontario, and are the parents of three sons.

==Politics==
===1990s===
Arnott first ran in the 1990 provincial election as the Progressive Conservative (PC) candidate in the Riding of Wellington at the age of 27; he was elected by a margin of 1,304 votes. At the time of his election, Arnott was the youngest MPP in the Ontario Progressive Conservative Caucus. Between 1990 and 1995, he served as PC Critic to the Minister of Transportation, and later as Critic to the Minister of Culture, Tourism, and Recreation, and as vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Estimates.

In the 1995 provincial election, Arnott was re-elected in Wellington, receiving 67% of the votes cast, as part of a majority Progressive Conservative Government led by Mike Harris.

While supporting the overall objectives of the Common Sense Revolution, the party&#x27;s electoral platform, during the campaign he refused to sign the Taxpayers&#x27; Protection Pledge being circulated by the Ontario Taxpayers&#x27; Federation. Despite pressure from his party, he explained at the time that he was not willing to make promises that he could not be certain of keeping. He was the only member of the PC caucus not to sign the pledge.

During the 1995–1999 term of office, he served as Chair of the Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly, and later as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Economic Development and Trade, with responsibilities for supporting small business.

Re-elected in the provincial election of 1999 in the newly created Riding of Waterloo—Wellington, he served as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Economic Development and later to the Minister of the Environment and then the Deputy Premier and Minister of Education. When Ernie Eves was elected Premier in 2002, Arnott asked not to be considered for a Cabinet position, saying the absences from home required of a Cabinet Minister would not allow him to spend sufficient time with his young family.

===2000s===
In the 2003 provincial election as Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s Liberals were given a majority, Arnott was re-elected in Waterloo-Wellington by a margin of 5,206 votes. This was despite a poll published by the Kitchener-Waterloo Record the week before the election predicting his defeat and claiming he was 18 percentage points behind his Liberal challenger.

Returning again to the role of Opposition, Arnott was appointed by the Legislature as First Deputy Chair of the Committee of the Whole House, a Presiding Officer role assisting the Speaker of the House.

In the 2007 provincial election, despite the re-election of a majority Liberal Government, Arnott was re-elected to the Legislature in the new Riding of Wellington—Halton Hills, becoming a GTA MPP for the first time. He was again appointed First Deputy Chair of the Committee of the Whole House, serving in this role until 2009. After Tim Hudak&#x27;s election as PC Leader, Arnott became vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Later his knowledge of House procedure was recognized with his appointment as Deputy House Leader of the Official Opposition.

===2010s===
Arnott was again re-elected in the 2011 provincial election, which saw the McGuinty Liberals return with a minority Government. He was again appointed as First Deputy Chair of the Committee of the Whole House.

After New Democratic Party Leader Andrea Horwath announced her party would vote against the 2014 Liberal Budget, the new Liberal leader, Kathleen Wynne, called a provincial election for June 12, 2014. Even though the PC Party ran a poor campaign province-wide, Arnott was re-elected in Wellington-Halton Hills by a comfortable margin. Once again, he was appointed First Deputy Chair of the Committee of the Whole House. He was named PC Critic to the Minister of Economic Development, Employment, and Infrastructure, and also served as PC Critic to the Minister of Labour. In February 2017, he was named PC Critic to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change.

Over the years, he has introduced many Private Member&#x27;s Bills and Resolutions which have been passed by the Legislature or been adopted as Government Policy.

A partial list of his legislative accomplishments includes his amendment to the Highway Traffic Act allowing volunteer firefighters to use a flashing green light on their personal vehicles when responding to an emergency. His resolution highlighting the Healthy Babies, Healthy Children program led to a 500 percent increase in its budget, allowing &quot;at risk&quot; children to be identified and receive the needed supports to reach their full potential. His amendment to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board Act to allow municipalities to purchase the highest level of coverage for their volunteer firefighters was adopted as a Government bill and was passed into law. His resolution calling attention to the diminishing contribution by the Government of Canada to Ontario&#x27;s health care costs was passed by the House, leading to a new health funding agreement. His controversial bill supporting &quot;double hatter&quot; firefighters received more hours of debate at 3rd Reading than any other Private Member&#x27;s Bill in the history of the Legislature. Working with a Liberal MPP, he introduced the very first bill in the history of the Ontario Legislature co-sponsored by Members from different parties. That bill established August 1 as Emancipation Day in Ontario, recognizing the day when slavery was abolished in the British Empire in 1834, and was passed into law. Another amendment he proposed to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board Act, to ensure volunteer firefighters were covered under &quot;presumptive legislation&quot; in the same manner as full-time firefighters, was adopted as Government policy. Another bill he introduced, co-sponsored by Liberal and NDP MPPs was passed recognizing January 21 as &quot;Lincoln Alexander Day&quot; in Ontario. Later a similar bill was passed by the Parliament of Canada. His resolution proposing a massive expansion of volunteer tree-planting efforts in Ontario for the province&#x27;s 150th anniversary in Confederation was passed by the House, leading to the announcement of &quot;Ontario&#x27;s Green Leaf Challenge&quot; program.

In recent years, he has worked with local partners and advocated for infrastructure projects, including a new Groves Memorial Community Hospital, supporting renovations and improvements to the Georgetown Hospital, the Highway 6 Morriston bypass project, a new Wilfrid Laurier University campus in Halton, and a new Halton Courthouse.

In November 2016, Arnott announced his intention to run in the 2018 provincial election. On June 7, 2018, he was re-elected to the Ontario Legislature representing Wellington-Halton Hills, receiving 31,659 votes or 54% of the ballots cast by voters. Across the province, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario won the election.

On July 11, 2018, Arnott was elected as Speaker of the Ontario Legislature on the first ballot.

In the early months of the 42nd Provincial Parliament, Arnott struggled visibly in his new role. With a large number of newly elected MPPs routinely trading insults across the floor, his efforts to gain control of the raucous House were often drowned out by the noise.

In July 2019, the Office of the Speaker released “Rules of Respect and Courtesy in the Chamber.” In it, Arnott urged MPPs to set a higher standard of behaviour in their day-to-day activities in the Legislature&#x27;s Chamber. He continued to encourage MPPs to do better, and over time the debates in the House became more respectful and issue-focused, and somewhat less divisive.

===2020s===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Arnott was empowered by the House to implement safe entry protocols which applied to everyone entering the Assembly precinct. The protocols required people to present proof of being vaccinated against COVID-19, or proof of recent, negative rapid antigen test before being admitted to the House. On December 7, 2021, Independent Cambridge MPP Belinda Karahalios was ejected from the Legislature, having refused to divulge her vaccine status to the Legislature&#x27;s staff, but seeking entry to the House by presenting a negative rapid antigen test. Because she had recently tested positive for COVID-19, Arnott declared the test result to be unreliable, citing current public health advice, and expelled her from the House.

On September 26, 2020, Arnott was nominated as the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s candidate in Wellington-Halton Hills for the 2022 provincial election. He was re-elected to the Assembly for a ninth term. On August 8, 2022, he was re-elected Speaker for the 43rd Provincial Parliament.

On April 17, 2024, in response to the situation in Palestine and Israel, Arnott prohibited Palestinian kaffiyehs from being worn by anyone — MPPs or guests — in the Ontario legislature over concerns the scarves make “an overt political statement.&quot; Ontario Premier Doug Ford immediately urged a reversal of Arnott&#x27;s ban.

==Honours and recognition==

Arnott is an Honorary Member of the Firefighters&#x27; Association of Ontario and the Ontario Association of Road Supervisors, in recognition of his work with those organizations.

In 2004, Wilfrid Laurier University named Arnott one of their graduates who are &quot;making a difference around the world.&quot;

<text>Stefan Weber (8 November 1946 – 7 June 2018) was an Austrian art teacher and the lead singer and &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; of the Viennese band Drahdiwaberl.

Weber founded the band in 1969 in the wake of the events of 1968. Drahdiwaberl are infamous for their elaborate stage shows which often include bizarre and, as some claim, disgusting elements. For example, in 2003 Weber was charged with illegal possession of firearms after using a pistol on stage. They also presented considerably controversial material, such as the song called &quot;Ganz Wien (ist heut&#x27; auf Heroin)&quot; (&quot;All Vienna [is hooked on heroin today]&quot;), which was subsequently banned by the authorities.

Their only hit record in Austria was the song &quot;Lonely&quot; produced with Lukas Resetarits which peaked at number four on the charts. in the Austrian Single charts.
In 1985 the band was able to return into the Austrian charts with the Song &quot;Mulatschag&quot;. Due to its moderate success it has been one of the last single released so far.

The three albums &quot;Psychoterror&quot;, &quot;MC Ronalds Massaker&quot; and &quot;Werwolfromantik&quot; peaked in the Austrian Top-Ten album charts and every album sold more than 30.000 copies. &quot;Psychoterror&quot; was certified with Gold in Austria.

As a former high school teacher, Weber had a natural talent of appealing to people in their late teens and early twenties, who are among his most dedicated fans. Early in his career, Falco played bass for Drahdiwaberl. After his leaving in 1983, he and the band produced the single &quot;Die Galeere&quot;.

He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering, where also his ashes are buried.

Drahdiwaberl have been announcing their final concert on a regular basis for many years now.

<doc id="815306" wikidata="Q7811767" url="?curid=815306" title="Toby Barrett">
<text>Theobald Butler &quot;Toby&quot; Barrett is a former Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the district of Haldimand—Norfolk for the Progressive Conservative Party from 1995 until 2022.

==Background==
Barrett was born in Port Dover, Ontario in 1945. His grandfather was Theobald Butler Barrett, Member of the Canadian Parliament for Norfolk from 1945 to 1949. Barrett received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Guelph in 1968, and a Master of Science degree from the Ontario Agricultural College in 1974. He later worked as a teacher of High School agriculture, and has been a partner in Farmleigh Farms since 1980. He is a past president of the Norfolk Farm Safety Association, and a member of the Norfolk Federation of Agriculture.

==Politics==
He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Rudy Stickl and incumbent New Democrat Norm Jamison in the riding of Norfolk. He was re-elected in 1999 in the redistributed riding of Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant. In 2003 he was re-elected again defeating Liberal candidate Rob Esselment by about 3,000 votes.

Barrett supported Jim Flaherty&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to succeed Ernie Eves as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in 2004.

In the 2007 Ontario general election, Barrett was easily re-elected, defeating Liberal candidate Lorraine Bergstrand by 26,100 votes to 9,500 votes in the newly redrawn riding of Haldimand-Norfolk. He was re-elected in the 2011 and 2014 elections.

Barrett served as the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry under Premier Doug Ford.

Barrett did not run in the 2022 election. When he announced his retirement, his longtime executive assistant Bobbi Ann Brady planned to run for the nomination to replace him as the PC candidate, but after the party&#x27;s central office directly appointed Haldimand County mayor Ken Hewitt as its new candidate without consulting the local electoral district association, Brady opted to run against Hewitt as an independent, with Barrett&#x27;s endorsement and participation in her campaign. Brady ultimately won the election, and was the only independent to win a seat.

<text>Theodore Preston Hill (born December 28, 1943), professor emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is an American mathematician specializing mainly in probability theory. He is an Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute (1993), and an Elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (1999).

==Contributions==
Hill discovered what many consider to be the definitive proof of Benford&#x27;s law. He is also known for his research in the theories of optimal stopping (including secretary problems and prophet inequality problems) and of fair division, in particular the Hill-Beck land division problem.

Hill has attracted widespread attention for a paper on the variability hypothesis, the theory that men exhibit greater variability than women in genetically controlled traits that he wrote with Sergei Tabachnikov. It was accepted but not published by &quot;The Mathematical Intelligencer&quot;; a later version authored by Hill alone was peer reviewed and accepted by &quot;The New York Journal of Mathematics&quot; and retracted after publication. A revised version, again authored by Hill alone, was subsequently peer reviewed again and published in the &quot;Journal of Interdisciplinary Mathematics&quot;.

==Education and career==
Born in Flatbush, New York, he studied at the United States Military Academy at West Point (Distinguished Graduate of the Class of 1966), and Stanford University (M.S. in Operations Research). After graduating from the U.S. Army Ranger School and serving as an Army Captain in the Combat Engineers of the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam, he returned to study mathematics at the University of Göttingen (Fulbright Scholar), the University of California at Berkeley (M.A., Ph.D. under advisor Lester Dubins), and as NATO/NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Leiden University.

He spent most of his career as a professor in the School of Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, with temporary appointments at Washington University in St. Louis, Tel Aviv University, the University of Hawaii, the University of Göttingen (Fulbright Professor), the University of Costa Rica, the Free University of Amsterdam, the Mexican Centre for Mathematical Research (CIMAT), and as Gauss Professor in the Göttingen Academy of Sciences. Hill has given invited mathematics research lectures in English, German, Spanish and Dutch.

<doc id="815347" wikidata="Q3915274" url="?curid=815347" title="Rick Bartolucci">
<text>Rick Bartolucci (born October 10, 1943) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2014. He represented the riding of Sudbury and was a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Bartolucci was born in Sudbury, has degrees from Laurentian University and the North Bay Teacher&#x27;s College, and worked as a teacher and school principal for thirty years before becoming an MPP.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
He was a Sudbury alderman and regional councillor from 1979 to 1982 and again from 1985 to 1991, and served as the city&#x27;s deputy mayor for a time.

===Provincial===
Bartolucci was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating New Democratic Party incumbent Sharon Murdock. The Progressive Conservative Party of Mike Harris won a majority government in this election, and Bartolucci entered the legislature as a member of the Official Opposition. He was appointed as his party&#x27;s critic for Northern Development and Culture and Communications. In December 1995, he helped organize a meeting at Queen&#x27;s Park where artists and cultural workers criticized the Harris government&#x27;s cuts to the arts sector. He later criticized the Harris government&#x27;s decision to close two of Sudbury&#x27;s three hospitals, arguing that it would compromise patient care.

Bartolucci was one of the three MPPs prevented from attending the Harris government&#x27;s first Speech from the Throne in September 1995, when police officers contracted by the government to guard against protesters refused them entry into the legislature. The other MPPs were veteran opposition member Sean Conway and cabinet minister Cam Jackson. Many opposition legislators and journalists later described the police presence as excessive. A similar incident took place in March 1996, when riot police contracted by the Harris government burst into Bartolucci&#x27;s legislative office without any warning or explanation, just before a melee with protesting public service workers. The police actions were widely criticized on this occasion as well.

Bartolucci was a co-manager of Dwight Duncan&#x27;s bid to lead the Ontario Liberal Party in 1996, and moved to the camp of Gerard Kennedy when Duncan was eliminated on the third ballot of the party&#x27;s leadership convention. Kennedy was defeated on the final ballot by Dalton McGuinty.

Bartolucci introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill in early 1997 to limit class sizes in Ontario&#x27;s public and separate schools. The government dropped this bill from the legislative agenda in January 1998. He later introduced a bill giving police the power to apprehend any person under eighteen who was involved in prostitution, and take that person to a safe house. The government introduced legislation modeled on Bartolucci&#x27;s proposal in 2000, and passed it into law in June 2002. Fourteen months later, Bartolucci complained that the law had not yet been enacted.

Bartolucci was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1999 provincial election, as the Progressive Conservatives won a second majority government. He was appointed to the Liberal Party&#x27;s election committee after the campaign, and later served as Chief Opposition Whip. In 2000, he criticized the provincial government for requiring that cancer patients in Northern Ontario pay most of their transportation costs to and from treatment in other areas, while patients referred from Toronto to Sudbury were provided with free transportation and lodging. Bartolucci indicated that he was exploring the possibility of a class-action lawsuit on the matter.

Bartolucci made frequent calls for Highway 69 to be twinned between Sudbury and Parry Sound, citing a growing number of fatal accidents in the area. He also chaired the JoeMac committee, which undertook a national campaign to have the killers of Sudbury police officer Joe MacDonald moved to a maximum security prison. The group also opposed what it described as lenient treatment for federal offenders.

===Cabinet minister===

===Minister of Northern Development and Mines===
Bartolucci was re-elected in 2003 as the Liberals won a majority government across the province. Bartolucci was endorsed by the Sudbury Police Association in the 2003 provincial election. On October 23, 2003, he was appointed as Minister of Northern Development and Mines in the newly formed government of Dalton McGuinty.

In early 2004, Bartolucci re-designated the Muskoka District as a part of southern rather than northern Ontario. The area had been a part of southern Ontario before 2000, when the Harris government chose to include it as part of the north. Bartolucci had criticized this decision at the time, arguing that it would allow wealthy cottage communities to access funds earmarked for northern development. Bartolucci declined to intervene when Inco announced the closure of its Copper Cliff copper refinery in May 2005, saying that he would not compel a company to keep open a financially troubled entity. The United Steelworkers of America protested this decision.

Bartolucci announced in March 2004 that he would end the previous government&#x27;s efforts to privatize the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission. He also called for the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund to re-focus its attention on job creation, with support from the private sector. The North Bay Chamber of Commerce and the union representing Ontario Northland Transportation Commission workers demanded the resignation or retirement of Bartolucci, claiming a negative impact on the economy of northern Ontario.

In June 2005, Bartolucci announced a twelve-year project for the expansion of Highway 69. In March 2006 he brought forward a new provincial mining strategy. The journal &quot;Mineweb&quot; called the plan a way to promote long-term sustainability and global competitiveness.

Bartolucci presided over the opening of Ontario&#x27;s first diamond mine in June 2006, and spoke of &quot;limitless&quot; potential for growth in the field. The McGuinty government later proposed a new tax on diamond mining. After criticism by groups such as DeBeers Canada, Bartolucci modified the tax to include deductions for new mining construction, and for expenditures made through agreements with aboriginal communities.

Bartolucci criticized the federal government of Stephen Harper in April 2006, arguing that its proposed settlement of a softwood lumber dispute with the United States would amount to &quot;selling out Ontario&quot;.

In August 2006, Justice Patrick Smith of the Ontario Superior Court issued a ruling against the mining exploration company Platinex Inc. in its ongoing battle with the remote Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug aboriginal community. Platinex was ordered not to work at the site for five months, and was ordered to participate in a consultation process involving the province. Bartolucci argued that this decision would not &quot;impact the legitimacy of other mining claims in Ontario&quot;. Others disputed his interpretation.

In mid-2007, the Ardoch Algonquin and Shabot Obaadjiwan First Nations began a protest against proposed uranium mining in the Sharbot Lake area. The protesters, who were supported by several members of the local non-aboriginal community, noted that they had not been consulted by the province before the company Frontenac Ventures began prospecting in the area. A spokesperson for Bartolucci&#x27;s office confirmed that the province had a legal obligation to consult with First Nations communities before allowing exploration, and said that the province was attempting to &quot;establish better processes&quot; in dealing with such matters.

===Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services===
Bartolucci was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election, in which the McGuinty government was re-elected with a second majority. On October 30, 2007, he was appointed as Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services.

Bartolucci amended the province&#x27;s sex offender registry in December 2007, after the provincial Auditor General reported that prisoners released from federal institutions had been omitted from the list.

Bartolucci introduced new animal protection legislation in April 2008 and the province&#x27;s new Animal Welfare Act was officially proclaimed in March 2009. The law requires that veterinarians report suspected cases of animal abuse, gives legal protection for veterinarians who make good faith reports, and increases penalties for animal abuse.

Bartolucci rejected calls for a moratorium on taser use in June 2008, when an Ontario resident died after being tasered in a confrontation with police. Amnesty International was among the groups calling for a moratorium on taser use. In 2009, he rejected a request that Ontario ban taser use on minors.

Bartolucci and Attorney General Chris Bentley appealed to the federal government to introduce stricter gun control legislation in March 2008, including a ban on handguns. They also criticized the federal government for extending an amnesty to gun owners who refuse to register their firearms. In April 2009, Bartolucci requested that the federal government reconsider its plans to weaken the provisions of the Canadian Firearms Registry.

Bartolucci announced in October 2008 that the McGuinty government would overhaul Ontario&#x27;s forensic pathology system and provide compensation for past miscarriages of justice, after receiving a report from Justice Stephen Goudge. This report confirmed previous media revelations that several people had been wrongly convicted of serious crimes due to errors made by discredited pathologist Charles Randal Smith. Bartolucci personally apologized on behalf of the government to those who suffered as a result of these errors and later announced that the McGuinty government would adopt all of the Goudge Report&#x27;s recommendations into law. Among other things, the report called for the creation of an oversight council to monitor Ontario&#x27;s chief coroner and chief forensic pathologist, the creation of a public complaints committee, and a provincial registry of pathologists.

Bartolucci rejected calls for a provincial inquiry into a native land dispute at Caledonia. He argued that this dispute was a federal issue.

In October 2009, Bartolucci faced some criticism from his constituents for avoiding a vote on Peter Kormos&#x27; private member&#x27;s bill to ban the use of replacement workers during a strike. With Vale Inco workers in Sudbury on strike, Bartolucci chose to remain neutral on the legislation in the hope that his position would encourage the company and the striking workers to return to the bargaining table.

He announced on February 7, 2013, that he would not run for re-election in the 41st Ontario general election.

<doc id="815373" wikidata="Q5111942" url="?curid=815373" title="Chris Bentley (politician)">
<text>Christopher Bentley (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2013. He represented the riding of London West and was a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Bentley received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, and obtained a law degree from the University of Toronto in 1979. Two years later, he obtained a Master&#x27;s degree from Cambridge University in England. Bentley has practiced criminal and labour law, with the firm of &quot;Bentley &amp; LeRoy LLP&quot;. In 1985, he was a founder and first chairperson of &quot;Neighbourhood Legal Services London &amp; Middlesex&quot;, a legal clinic intended to assist low-income clients.

Since 1992, Bentley has worked as a part-time professor at Western. He helped establish the university&#x27;s Law School Careers Office, and has lectured at various continuing education courses. In 2000, he published a book entitled &quot;Criminal practice manual: A practical guide to handling criminal cases&quot;.

==Politics==
Bentley ran for the provincial legislature in the 2003 general election, contesting the riding of London West as a Liberal. He was successful, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Bob Wood by over 10,000 votes. The Liberals won the election, and Bentley was appointed Minister of Labour on October 23, 2003. After a cabinet shuffle on June 29, 2005, he was named Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.

Bentley was re-elected in the 2007 election and was named Attorney General of Ontario shortly thereafter. In January 2010 he was assigned the additional portfolio of Minister of Aboriginal Affairs.

He retained his seat in the October 2011 provincial election, and was named Minister of Energy. Bentley was soon mired in controversy over the government&#x27;s decision made during the election campaign to scrap unpopular gas plants being constructed in Mississauga and Oakville - the move was seen as a politically expedient one made to improve the Liberal Party&#x27;s chances of retaining the 5 ridings it held in the area. The election returned a minority government and the emboldened opposition demanded that Bentley&#x27;s ministry release all documents related to the decision. Bentley delayed releasing 36,000 pages in September and insisted that all documents had been released. After it became known that there were an additional 20,000 documents Bentley was cited by a rare contempt motion by a legislative committee and was facing a contempt motion of the legislature when McGuinty unexpectedly ended the legislative session by proroguing the legislature on October 15.

Previously, Bentley had widely been seen as Premier Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s apparent heir but on October 25, 2012, ten days after McGuinty announced his resignation, Bentley announced that he would not be a candidate in the Liberal Party leadership convention being held to choose McGuinty&#x27;s successor and that he too would be leaving politics. Bentley resigned his seat in the legislature effective February 14, 2013.

<text>Montgomery Bell Academy (MBA) is a preparatory day school for boys in grades 7 through 12 in Nashville, Tennessee. The school is located in the Whitland Area Neighborhood.

==History==

MBA was established in 1867 in the aftermath of the American Civil War. It is the successor to two schools: the Western Military Institute, which Sam Davis, the &quot;Boy Hero of the Confederacy&quot;, attended, and the former University of Nashville. The school&#x27;s board operates under the corporate title, &quot;Board of Trustees of the University of Nashville&quot;, although the university was disbanded in 1909.

From 1870 to 1875, former Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith was the chancellor of the University of Nashville, which comprised both a two-year college operating as the University of Nashville, and MBA, the preparatory high school and grammar school. In 1875, a financial crisis and a donation from the Peabody Fund caused an organizational separation of the university and the preparatory school. The university used the proceeds of the Peabody Fund and was operated under a new board of trustees under the name of Peabody Normal College, later called the George Peabody College for Teachers. The board of trustees of the University of Nashville continued to operate MBA as a preparatory school.

From about 1880 until 1915, the school operated across University Street from the campus of the former University of Nashville. In 1915, the school bought a West End Avenue estate known as Totomoi from the Tinsley family, and the campus moved soon after. 

The military nature of one of the predecessors notwithstanding, under its current name it has always operated as a civilian institution, and as a day school rather than a boarding school. The school is named in honor of Montgomery Bell, a Pennsylvania native who made his fortune as the early 19th century &quot;ironmaster&quot; of Middle Tennessee and whose will endowed it, with the stipulation that it forever be an all-male institution.

In the 1970s, the school&#x27;s enrollment surged as white parents withdrew their children from racially integrated public schools. In 1980, the headmaster Michael Drake told a newspaper &quot;Every time the court rules in the Metro desegregation case, our enrollment goes way up.&quot;

==Campus and resources==

Montgomery Bell Academy&#x27;s campus consists of eight academic and administrative buildings, a gymnasium, and numerous on-campus athletic facilities.

Montgomery Bell Academy also owns and operates a 24&#x27; telescope in McMinnville, Tennessee at Long Mountain. This site is noted for having the least ambient light in the Southeastern United States, making conditions favorable for astrophotography. Annually, the Montgomery Bell Academy faculty and student body journey to the facility to hold the school&#x27;s annual Leadership Retreat. On the facility grounds, there are two football fields, a lake, a high ropes course, and a low ropes course. The main feature of the campus (besides the observatory) is the large cliff to the west of the building. Students are challenged each year to rappel down the cliff and climb up the cliff as well. On occasion, the school&#x27;s climbing club comes to the facility to practice all-natural rock climbing.

In 2011, Montgomery Bell Academy added the new Lowry Building in late December. In 2012, the school&#x27;s new building, the Wallace Building, was completed. In addition to these new structures, a geothermal heating and cooling system was added. The school has also constructed new, porous parking lots to facilitate the new irrigation system.

Montgomery Bell Academy also has exchange links with other boys&#x27; schools throughout the English-speaking world; these include Eton College and Winchester College in England, Kearsney College and Michaelhouse in South Africa, and The Southport School, The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta and, most recently, Melbourne Grammar School in Australia, Christ&#x27;s College, Christchurch in New Zealand and The Raffles Institution in Singapore. Winchester College and Eton College are similar to MBA through discipline, dress code, and having an all-male student body.

Notable individuals who have spoken to the student body include Michael Crichton, Ted Turner, Peyton Manning, Charles Townes, and Robert Orr, Jr.

A statue of Sam Davis was installed on the school grounds, until 2020.

In 2021, MBA completed construction of a new 200,000-square-foot athletic and wellness center, the Burkholder Wellness Center. The project also included a new football stadium and lacrosse field.

==Athletics==
Montgomery Bell Academy&#x27;s sports offerings include football, basketball, baseball, soccer, lacrosse, and more.

The school has won the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association&#x27;s football championship fourteen times, from 1915 to 2014.

The school has also gained recognition for its Cross Country team. Since its inception in 1995, the team has claimed a total of thirteen state championships. Most notably, the team claimed a perfect sweep in the state championship of 2010, in which all top five places were claimed by the school&#x27;s runners.

The school&#x27;s tennis team was able to claim the state title of 2013 over the Gulliver Preparatory School by a margin of 5-to-4. The team also hosts a spring tennis tournament, entitled the Francis Carter Invitational. 

The MBA Soccer Program is led by the former Coach of Waterford United (Irish Premier League), Giles Cheevers. MBA Soccer captured the 2015 TSSAA Tennessee State Soccer Championship (DII-AA) with a 3-0 win over Christian Brothers High School (CBHS).

==Debate and forensics==
In addition to its academics programs, Montgomery Bell Academy has a separate debate and forensics program. The school offers Policy Debate to its students.

Annually, Montgomery Bell Academy hosts its speech and debate tournament, the Southern Bell Forum. The tournament has a unique ranking system, where speaker points are accounted for in the final ranking system.

==Visual and performing arts==

The Montgomery Bell Academy theater program has won awards at the Tennessee Theater Association. The school also performs its annual student-directed one-acts in April and May, where it invites the students to write and direct their original scripts. MBA also performs its annual musical with students from the Harpeth Hall School. The high school orchestra is known as the MBA Sinfonia.

==In popular culture==
Montgomery Bell Academy graduate Thomas Schulman, class of 1968, wrote the screenplay for the 1989 motion picture &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, which depicts a fictional school patterned after Montgomery Bell Academy. Robin Williams portrayed a character based on Sam Pickering, one of Schulman&#x27;s teachers during his years at Montgomery Bell Academy.

<text>The Ravi River is a transboundary river in South Asia, flowing through northwestern India and eastern Pakistan, and is one of five major rivers of the Punjab region.

Under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the waters of the Ravi and two other rivers of the Punjab (Sutlej and Beas River) were allocated to India. Subsequently, the Indus Basin Project was developed in Pakistan, which transfers waters from western rivers of the Indus system to replenish the portion of the Ravi River lying in that country. Many inter-basin water transfers, irrigation, hydropower and multipurpose projects have been built in India.

==History==
According to ancient history traced to Vedas, the Ravi River was known as ().
The Ravi was known as Purushni or Irawati to Indians in Vedic times and as Hydraotes () and Hyarotis (Ὑαρῶτις) to the Ancient Greeks.

Part of the Battle of the Ten Kings was fought on a river, which according to Yaska (Nirukta 9.26) refers to the Ravi river at Punjab.

==Geography==
The Ravi River, a transboundary river of India and Pakistan, is an integral part of the Indus River Basin and forms the headwaters of the Indus basin. The waters of the Ravi River drain into the Arabian Sea (Indian Ocean) through the Indus River in Pakistan. The river rises in the Bara Bhangal, Kangra District in Himachal Pradesh, India. The river drains a total catchment area of in India after flowing for a length of . Flowing westward, it is hemmed by the Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges, forming a triangular zone.

===River course===
;Source reach
The Ravi River originates in the Himalayas in the Multhan tehsil of Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. It follows a north-westerly course and is a perennial river. It is the smallest of the five Punjab rivers that rise from glacier fields at an elevation of , on the southern side of the Mid Himalayas. It flows through Barabhangal, Bara Bansu, and Chamba districts. It flows in rapids in its initial reaches with boulders seen scattered in the bed of the river. The Ravi River in this reach flows in a gorge with a river bed slope of and is mostly fed by snowmelt, as this region lies in a rain shadow. Two of its major tributaries, the Budhil and Nai or Dhona join downstream from its source. The Budhil River rises in Lahul range of hills and is sourced from the Manimahesh Kailash Peak and the Manimahesh Lake, at an elevation of , and both are Hindu pilgrimage sites. The entire length of Budhil is where it has a bed slope of . It flows through the ancient capital of Bharmwar, now known as Bharmour in Himachal Pradesh. During 1858–1860, the Raja of Bharmour had considered the Budhil valley as an excellent source of Deodar trees for supply to the British Raj. However, a part of the forest surrounding the temple was considered sacred and declared a reserved area. The second tributary, the Nai, rises at Kali Debi pass, and flows for , with a bed slope of , from its source at Trilokinath to its confluence with the Ravi. This valley was also exploited for its forest wealth during the English period.

Another major tributary that joins the Ravi River, just below Bharmour, the old capital of Chamba, is the Seul River from the northern direction. The valley formed by the river was also exploited for its rich timber trees. However, the valley has large terraces, which are very fertile and known as &quot;the garden of Chamba&quot;. Crops grown here supply grains to the capital region and to Dalhousie town and its surrounding areas. One more major tributary that joins the Ravi River near Basohli (J&amp;K) is the Seva. This river was also exploited for its forest resources, (controlled by the then Raja of Chamba) originating from the Jammu region. The valley is also formed by another major tributary that joins the Seul River, the Baira-Nalla. Its sub-basin is in the Chamba district, located above Tissa. Baira drains the southern slopes of the Pir Panjal Range. The valley has an elevation variation between .

Tant Gari is another small tributary that rises from the subsidiary hill ranges of the Pir Panjal Range east of Bharmour. The valley formed by this stream is U-shaped with a river bed scattered with boulders and glacial morainic deposits.
;Main Ravi River

The main Ravi River flows through the base of Dalhousie hill, past the Chamba town. It is at an elevation of (where a long wooden bridge existed to cross the Ravi River). It flows into the south-west, near Dalhousie, and then cuts a gorge in the Dhauladhar Range, before entering the Punjab plain near Madhopur and Pathankot. It then flows along the Indo–Pak border for before entering Pakistan and joining the Chenab River. The total length of the river is about .

The Ujh River is another major tributary of the Ravi River. Its source is in the Kailash mountains at an elevation of , close to the Bhaderwah Mountains in the Jammu district. After flowing for , it joins Ravi at Nainkot in Pakistan.

As the Ravi flows past Lahore in Pakistan ( below Amritsar in India) it is called &quot;The river of Lahore&quot; since that city is on its eastern bank. After passing through Lahore the river takes a turn at Kamalia and then debouches into the Chenab River, south of the town of Ahmadpur Sial. On its western bank is the town of Shahdara Bagh with the Tomb of Jahangir and the Tomb of Noor Jahan.

; Change of river course
According to satellite imagery studies carried out over a period of 20 years (between 1972–1973 and 1991–1993), the river coursing along the India–Pakistan border meanders substantially in the alluvial plains of the Amritsar, Pathankot, and Gurdaspur districts of Punjab. This has resulted in successive damage in India as a result of the river changing its course towards India. The reason attributed to this change in the course of the river is massive river training structures/bunds constructed by Pakistan in its part of the river, close to the old course of the river. The shift in the course of the river is reported to be towards India.

; River water pollution

In the transboundary Ravi River flowing from India to Pakistan, in urban areas of Lahore the pollution levels in the river discharge are reportedly very high, which is attributed to careless disposal of large amount of industrial and agricultural wastewater and faulty drainage systems in both countries. A stretch of the Ravi River from Lahore Siphon to Baloki headworks indicates heavy contamination of the water and sediment with Cd, Cr, Pt, and Cu. Recent reports suggest that the river stands as the most contaminated globally, with pharmaceutical residues such as paracetamol, nicotine, caffeine, and medications for epilepsy and diabetes detected in its waters. The river sediments are highly contaminated and have become a secondary source for pollution of the river water, even though some control over unauthorised discharges into the river have been checked. Hence, measures to check metal re-mobilization from sediments into the river flows need attention. The worst affected drainage is the Hadharaam drain, a tributary of the Ravi River. It is also a trans-border problem involving both India and Pakistan. A UNDP funded special programme was launched in 2006 to address the issue in both countries.

==Vegetation==
The northern portion surrounding the Ravi is the lifeline of many different flora, notably deodar, walnut, holly oak, mulberry, alder, edible pine, Himalayan cypress, chinar, &quot;Daphne papyracea&quot;, north Indian rosewood, olive, and &quot;Toxicodendron acuminatum&quot;.

==Hydrology==

The waters of the Ravi River are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty, signed by India and Pakistan. Within India, the river is under the jurisdiction of the riparian states of Punjab, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and Himachal, and non-riparian states of Haryana, and Rajasthan, but the management is presided by the Supreme Court of India and the Ravi Beas Tribunal, set up in 1986 for the purpose. The annual flow in India up to the final crossing point in Pakistan is (MAF) out of which 6.971 MAF is available upstream of Madhopur headworks. Most of the water generated below the Madhopur headworks (4.549 MAF) is flowing into Pakistan from India.

===Pre-partition utilisation===

On the Ravi River, the earliest project built was the Madhopur Headworks, in 1902. It is a run-of-the river project (no storage envisaged) to divert flows through the Upper Bari Doab Canal (also known as Central Bari Doab Canal) to provide irrigation in the command area of the then unified India. Government of India has assessed the pre-partition use in India (Punjab) at . Prior to partition, it irrigated 335,000 hectares of land in Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Lahore districts.

===Hydropower===
The hydropower potential of the Ravi River system has been assessed at 2294 MW, of which only 1638 MW has been harnessed cumulatively, thus leaving 656 MW wasted opportunity. The hydropower potential developed since the 1980s is through the installation of the Baira Suil Hydroelectric Power Project of 198 MW capacity, the Chamera-I of 540 MW capacity commissioned in 1994, the Ranjitsagar Multipurpose Project of 600 MW capacity completed in 1999 and the Chamera-II of 300 MW capacity in the upstream of Chamera-I commissioned in 2004.

===Multipurpose development===

The major multipurpose project (irrigation, hydropower, flood control, development of fisheries, tourism and so forth) built on the river is the Ranjit Sagar Dam (also known as Thein dam as it is in Thein village). The left bank is in Punjab and the right bank is in Jammu and Kashmir. It is located on the main stem of the Ravi River, about upstream of Madhopur Headworks (built during pre-partition time). The project is an outcome of the development plan conceived for the use of the waters of three eastern rivers allocated to India under the Indus Treaty, namely the Sutlej, the Beas and the Ravi, for irrigation, hydropower generation and other consumptive uses.

A proposal for building a storage dam on the Ravi River was initially planned in 1912, envisaging a high dam. A committee later conducted a survey of the area, but it was not until 1954 that geologists fully inspected the project area. In 1957, a storage Dam was proposed on the Ravi River for irrigation purposes only. The power generation aspect was not considered then. It was only in 1964 that the project was conceived for multipurpose development and submitted to Government of India for approval. Finally, in April 1982, the project was approved for construction by the Government of India.

The project, as built now, has a high earth gravel shell dam with a gross irrigation potential of of land and power generation of 600 MW (4 units of 150 MW capacity each).

The geomorpohological setting of the river basin, which has a large number of terraces between Dhauladhar and Pir Panjal ranges, is attributed to the truly Himalayan characteristics of the river reflecting the &quot;cis-Himalayan tectonic; structural, lithological and climatic conditions. Obviously it is different from the Indus and Sutlej&quot;.

==International water-sharing treaty==
The upper reaches of the main Indus River and its tributaries lie in India whereas the lower reaches are in Pakistan. Following the partition of India in August 1947, a dispute arose between India and Pakistan on sharing of the waters of the Indus River Basin. The dispute was resolved with the intervention of the World Bank and a treaty was signed in 1960 on sharing of the Indus waters between India and Pakistan.

The Indus system of rivers comprises the three Western rivers in the Indus, the Jhelum and Chenab together with three eastern rivers: the Sutlej, the Beas, and the Ravi. To establish the ownership of these waters, Indus Water Treaty was signed between India and Pakistan on 1 April 1960, under the monitoring of the World Bank. The treaty, under Article 5.1, envisages the sharing of waters of the rivers Ravi, Beas, Sutlej, Jhelum, and Chenab which join the Indus River on its left bank (eastern side) in Pakistan. According to this treaty, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej, which constitute the eastern rivers, are allocated for exclusive use by India before they enter Pakistan. However, a transition period of 10 years was permitted in which India was bound to supply water to Pakistan from these rivers until Pakistan was able to build the canal system for utilisation of waters of Jhelum, Chenab, and the Indus itself, allocated to it under the treaty. Similarly, Pakistan has exclusive use of the western rivers Jhelum, Chenab, and Indus but with some stipulations for the development of projects on these rivers in India. Pakistan also received one-time financial compensation for the loss of water from the eastern rivers. Since 31 March 1970, after the 10-year moratorium, India has secured full rights for use of the waters of the three rivers allocated to it. The treaty resulted in partitioning of the rivers rather than sharing of their waters.

Under this treaty, the two countries also agreed to exchange data and co-operate in matters related to the treaty. For this purpose, the treaty envisaged the creation of the Permanent Indus Commission, with a commissioner appointed by each country. The Indus Waters Treaty is the only international treaty that has been implemented over the last 60 years with due diligence and sincerity by both India and Pakistan, in spite of many wars fought between the two countries (the treaty was not revoked either by India or Pakistan during the 1965 or the 1971 war).

==Interstate water dispute==
Even prior to the partition of India in August 1947, India had developed projects on the river Ravi and Beas River system. When the treaty was under debate, India had taken advance action to develop the three rivers, which were eventually allocated to it under the treaty. According to a directive of the Government of India, planning for the development of the Ravi and Beas rivers was initiated concurrently with the treaty negotiations, which involved four riparian states of Punjab, PEPSU (this was merged with Punjab and subsequently Punjab was divided, and additionally the Haryana state was created), Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) within the ambit of the already developed Bhakra Nangal Dam project on the Sutlej River. A review of the flows in the two river systems revealed that prior to the partition of the country and up to the time of the signing of the Indus Treaty, of water was used by major irrigation systems such as the Upper Bari Doab Canal System (1959) and the Lower Bari Doab Canal System (1915). The unused flow in the two river systems was assessed at , which was planned to be developed by the four states of J&amp;K, PEPSU, Punjab and Rajasthan. However, with the merger of PEPSU with Punjab and subsequent bifurcation of Punjab into two states, a dispute arose on the allocation of Ravi and Beas waters for which a tribunal was set up under the Interstate River Water Disputes Act.

As a counterclaim to the exclusive claims of Punjab, Haryana claims that a small part of Haryana state lying north in Panchkula district is part of the Sutlej river basin area in addition to Punjab and Himachal Pradesh in India. Thus Haryana claims to be a riparian state of the Indus river basin.

Following the reorganisation of the state of Punjab in 1966, Haryana State was created. This was followed by a notification by the Government of India dated 24 March 1976 allocating the surplus waters between Punjab and Haryana in due consideration of the powers conferred by Sub Section (I) of Section 78 of the Punjab Reorganization Act, 1966 (31 of 1966). The allocation was challenged in the Supreme Court by Haryana. A tripartite agreement followed on 31 December 1981, based on the revised mean annual flows from the flow series of 1921–60 assessed as —including preparation use of and transit losses in the Madhopur Beas Link of —vis-a-vis the figure of assessed in earlier allocation, which was based on the flow series of 1921–45. The revised assessed surplus supplies of (from flow and storage) was allocated as:

However, the legality of this agreement was challenged by Punjab. This was followed by the Punjab accord signed by the then Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi and Sant Harchand Singh Longowal, President of the Shiromani Akali Dal, on 24 July 1985. This accord stipulated that 

Following the above accord, Ravi &amp; Beas Waters Tribunal (RBWT) came to be set up in April 1986, in pursuance of paragraphs 9.1 &amp; 9.2 of Punjab Settlement (Rajiv-Longowal Accord, 1985) inter-alia to adjudicate the claims of Punjab and Haryana in Ravi-Beas waters. The Terms of Reference were set and also the time for submission of the report. The Tribunal submitted its report on 30 January 1987. However, the report was contested as Rajasthan also moved an application &quot;seeking explanation and guidance regarding the report of this Ravi Beas waters Tribunal, 1987&quot;. The Tribunal is further examining the matter. It is yet to submit its further report to the Government on the pleas submitted by the party States and the Central Government also seeking explanation/guidance on its earlier report. In the meantime, a Presidential reference on Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004 is pending before the Honorable Supreme Court. Hence, the further hearings of the Tribunal and its final report are now enjoined on the outcome of the Supreme Court hearing of the Presidential reference. The presently incomplete SYL link canal, to connect the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers to transfer Haryana&#x27;s share of water, is now stuck in a dispute in the Supreme Court of India due to objections by Punjab.

Punjab is contemplating to construct 206 MW Shahpurkandi dam project hydro electric project on the Ravi River between Ranjitsagar dam and Madhopur head works. This stretch of the river is forming boundary between J &amp; K state and Punjab state. Since Punjab had unilaterally exited from the earlier water sharing agreements, J &amp; K state refused the project construction. Also J &amp; K state is going ahead with the construction of Ravi canal originating from Basantpur to irrigate of land in Jammu region. This canal would draw river water by pumping the water released downstream from the Rangitsagar reservoir for which J &amp; K state is not required to take consent from Punjab as it is not bound by earlier river water sharing agreements.

==Interbasin water transfer==
Transfer of surplus water from one basin to another, termed as interbasin water transfer has been effectively implemented on the Ravi River. The surplus waters of the Ravi River have been transferred directly first to the Beas River through the Ravi-Beas Link. A further link from the Beas River to the Sutlej River by the Beas Sutlej Link augments storage of the Bhakra reservoir in India.

<text>&quot;Ulalume&quot; () is a poem written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1847. Much like a few of Poe&#x27;s other poems (such as &quot;The Raven&quot;, &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;, and &quot;Lenore&quot;), &quot;Ulalume&quot; focuses on the narrator&#x27;s loss of his beloved due to her death. Poe originally wrote the poem as an elocution piece and, as such, the poem is known for its focus on sound. Additionally, it makes many allusions, especially to mythology, and the identity of Ulalume herself, if a real person, has been a subject of debate.

==Overview==

The poem takes place on a night in the &quot;lonesome October&quot; with a gray sky as the leaves are withering for the autumn season. In the region of Weir, by the lake of Auber, the narrator roams with a &quot;volcanic&quot; heart. He has a &quot;serious and sober&quot; talk with his soul, though he does not realize it is October or where his roaming is leading him. He remarks on the stars as night fades away, remarking on the brightest one, and wonders if it knows that the tears on his cheeks have not yet dried. His soul, however, mistrusts the star and where it is leading them. Just as the narrator calms his soul, he realizes he has unconsciously walked to the vault of his &quot;lost Ulalume&quot; on the very night he had buried her a year before.

==Analysis==
Unlike Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;, this poem presents a narrator who is not conscious of his return to the grave of his lost love. This reveals the speaker&#x27;s dependence on Ulalume and her love; his losing her leaves him not only sad but absolutely devastated and, by visiting her grave, he unconsciously subjects himself to further self-inflicted anguish. The poem has a heavy focus on decay and deterioration: the leaves are &quot;withering&quot; and the narrator&#x27;s thoughts are &quot;palsied&quot;. Like many of Poe&#x27;s later poems, &quot;Ulalume&quot; has a strong sense of rhythm and musicality. The verses are purposefully sonorous, built around sound to create feelings of sadness and anguish. The poem employs Poe&#x27;s typical theme of the &quot;death of a beautiful woman&quot;, which he considered &quot;the most poetical topic in the world&quot;. Biographers and critics have often suggested that Poe&#x27;s obsession with this theme stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his mother Eliza Poe, his wife, and his foster mother Frances Allan.

The identity of Ulalume in the poem is uncertain. Poe scholar and distant relative Harry Lee Poe says it is autobiographical and shows Poe&#x27;s grief over the recent death of his wife Virginia. Scholar Scott Peeples notes that &quot;Ulalume&quot; serves as a sequel to &quot;The Raven&quot;. Poetically, the name Ulalume emphasizes the letter &quot;L&quot;, a frequent device in Poe&#x27;s female characters such as &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;, &quot;Eulalie&quot;, and &quot;Lenore&quot;. If it really stands for a deceased love, Poe&#x27;s choosing to refer to Ulalume as &quot;the thing&quot; and &quot;the secret&quot; do not seem endearing terms. In one possible view, Ulalume may be representative of death itself.

===Allusions===

Much work has been done by scholars to identify all of Poe&#x27;s allusions, most notably by Thomas Ollive Mabbott, though other scholars suggest that the names throughout the poem should be valued only because of their poetic sounds. The title itself suggests wailing (from the Latin &quot;ululare&quot;). The name may also allude to the Latin &quot;lumen&quot;, a light symbolizing sorrow. The narrator personifies his soul as the ancient Greek Psyche, representing the irrational but careful part of his subconsciousness. It is Psyche who first feels concerned about where they are walking and makes the first recognition that they have reached Ulalume&#x27;s vault.

The bright star they see is Astarte, a goddess associated with Venus and connected with fertility and sexuality. The &quot;sinfully scintillant planet&quot; in the original final verse is another reference to Venus. Astarte may represent a sexual temptress or a vision of the ideal. Mount Yaanek, with its &quot;sulphurous currents&quot; in the &quot;ultimate climes of the pole&quot;, has been associated with Mount Erebus, a volcano in Antarctica first sighted in 1841, although Yaanek&#x27;s location is specified as being in &quot;the realms of the pole&quot;, indicating an Arctic location rather than an Antarctic one for the fictional counterpart. The Auber and Weir references in the poem may be to two contemporaries of Poe: Daniel François Esprit Auber, a composer of sad operatic tunes, and Robert Walter Weir, a painter of the Hudson River School famous for his landscapes.

==Publication history==

Poe wrote the poem on the request of Reverend Cotesworth Bronson, who had asked Poe for a poem he could read at one of his lectures on public speaking. He asked Poe for something with &quot;vocal variety and expression&quot;. Bronson decided not to use the poem Poe sent him, &quot;Ulalume&quot;. Poe then submitted the poem to &quot;Sartain&#x27;s Union Magazine&quot;, which rejected it as too dense. Poe probably saw Bronson&#x27;s request as a personal challenge as well as an opportunity to enhance his renown, especially after his previous poem &quot;The Raven&quot; had also been demonstrated for its elocution style.

&quot;Ulalume - A Ballad&quot; was finally published, albeit anonymously, in the &quot;American Whig Review&quot; in December, 1847. Originally, Poe had sold his essay &quot;&quot;, then unpublished, to the &quot;Review&quot;&#x27;s editor George Hooker Colton. Colton did not immediately print the manuscript, so Poe exchanged it for &quot;Ulalume&quot;.

It was reprinted by Nathaniel Parker Willis, still anonymously, in the &quot;Home Journal&quot; with a note asking who the author was, on Poe&#x27;s request, to stir up interest. Some, including Evert Augustus Duyckinck, presumed that the poem&#x27;s author was Willis. The initial publication had 10 stanzas. Poe&#x27;s literary executor Rufus Wilmot Griswold was the first to print &quot;Ulalume&quot; without its final stanza, now the standard version. Poe himself once recited the poem with the final stanza, but admitted it was not intelligible and that it was scarcely clear to himself.

==Critical response==
Aldous Huxley, in his essay &quot;Vulgarity in Literature&quot;, calls &quot;Ulalume&quot; &quot;a carapace of jewelled sound&quot;, implying it lacks substance. Huxley uses the poem as an example of Poe&#x27;s poetry being &quot;too poetical&quot;, equivalent to wearing a diamond ring on every finger. Poet Daniel Hoffman says the reader must &quot;surrender his own will&quot; to the &quot;hypnotic spell&quot; of the poem and its &quot;meter of mechanical precision&quot;. &quot;Reading &#x27;Ulalume&#x27; is like making a meal of marzipan&quot;, he says. &quot;There may be nourishment in it but the senses are deadened by the taste, and the aftertaste gives one a pain in the stomach&quot;.

The poem did, however, receive some praise. An early 20th-century edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; noted how the sound in &quot;Ulalume&quot; was successful. It said the &quot;monotonous reiterations [of] &#x27;Ulalume&#x27; properly intoned would produce something like the same effect upon a listener knowing no word of English that it produces on us.&quot; George Gilfillan remarked in the &quot;London Critic&quot;:
After Poe&#x27;s death, Thomas Holley Chivers claimed &quot;Ulalume&quot; was plagiarized from one of his poems. Chivers made several similar unfounded accusations against Poe. Even so, he said the poem was &quot;nector mixed with ambrosia&quot;. Another friend of Poe, Henry B. Hirst, suggested in the January 22, 1848, issue of the &quot;Saturday Courier&quot; that Poe had found the &quot;leading idea&quot; of the poem in a work by Thomas Buchanan Read.

Bret Harte composed a parody of the poem entitled &quot;The Willows&quot; featuring the narrator, in the company of a woman called Mary, running out of credit at a bar:

:And I said &#x27;What is written, sweet sister,
:At the opposite side of the room?&#x27;
:She sobbed, as she answered, &#x27;All liquors
:Must be paid for ere leaving the room.&#x27;

==In other media==
* In F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s debut novel &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, the protagonist Amory Blaine recites &quot;Ulalume&quot; while wandering through the countryside. Another character, Eleanor Savage, calls Blaine &quot;the auburn-haired boy who likes &#x27;Ulalume.&#x27;&quot; When the two are caught in a thunderstorm, Savage volunteers to play the role of Psyche while Blaine recites the poem. 
* In H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s novella &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, a character refers to the poem. While looking at Mount Erebus, a character suggests &quot;this mountain, discovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of Poe&#x27;s image when he wrote seven years later&quot;, followed by a few lines of &quot;Ulalume&quot;. Lovecraft&#x27;s famous early poem &quot;Nemesis&quot; (1917) was also influenced by a combination of &quot;Ulalume&quot; and Algernon Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Hertha&quot;. 
* Roger Zelazny&#x27;s 1993 novel, &quot;A Night in the Lonesome October&quot; and Richard Laymon&#x27;s 2001 novel &quot;Night in the Lonesome October&quot;, each take their titles from this poem, though neither book seems to draw much else from Poe. 
* In the Tennessee Williams play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; the character Blanche DuBois likens the residence of her sister Stella to the &quot;ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir&quot;, a reference to &quot;Ulalume&quot;. 
* In Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962), Humbert Humbert (James Mason) reads a fragment of the poem to Lolita (Sue Lyon). 
* In his history of the Union Army, &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot;, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Bruce Catton places the American Civil War Battle of Chickamauga as occurring in a dark and frightening place evocative of Poe&#x27;s &quot;ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir&quot;. 
* The singer Jeff Buckley recorded a reading of this poem.
* In Lynn Cullen&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;Mrs. Poe&quot; (2014), the narrator and protagonist, Frances Sargent Osgood, uses the false name of Mrs. &quot;Ulalume&quot; when she and Edgar Allan Poe sneak off together to Boston. Later in the book, Cullen suggests that the &quot;Psyche&quot; referred to in the poem is actually Osgood, Poe&#x27;s lover in the book, and that &quot;Ulalume&quot; refers to a daughter born to them, who died in October 1847.
*Joseph Holbrooke&#x27;s Symphonic Poem Ulalume, Op. 35 is based on the poem.
*All three titles of TJ Klune&#x27;s post-apocalyptic duology &quot;Immemorial Year&quot;, consisting of the novels &quot;Withered + Sere&quot; and &quot;Crisped + Sere&quot;, can be found in the first stanza of the poem. The main character, grieving his dead wife and son, is given a copy of the poem, and it is quoted from throughout the novels.

<doc id="815511" wikidata="Q7260340" url="?curid=815511" title="Punjabi Suba movement">
<text>The Punjabi Suba movement was a political movement led by Punjabi-speakers (mainly Sikhs) from 1947 to 1966, demanding the creation of an autonomous &quot;Punjabi Suba&quot;, or Punjabi-speaking state, in the post-independence Indian state of East Punjab. It is regarded as the forerunner of the Khalistan movement.

Borrowing from the pre-independence demands for a Sikh country, this movement demanded a fundamental constitutional autonomous state within India. Led by the Akali Dal, it resulted in the formation of the state of Punjab. The state of Haryana and the Union Territory of Chandigarh were also created and some Pahari-majority parts of the East Punjab were also merged with Himachal Pradesh following the movement. The result of the movement failed to satisfy its leaders.

==Early years (1947-1949)==
===Partition===
Calls for the Punjabi Suba had been heard as far back as February 1947, and the demand for a Punjabi Suba as a policy position was first presented in April 1948 by Tara Singh of the Shiromani Akali Dal, a Sikh political party active mainly in Punjab. The movement was primarily conceived to secure a distinct Sikh political status as a safeguard for what was to be a small minority after independence; as Tara Singh wrote in 1945, &quot;there is not the least doubt that the Sikh religion will live only as long as the Sikh &quot;panth&quot; exists as an organized entity.&quot; The Akali Dal considered the continued existence of the Sikh religion as predicated on the community acting as a consolidated political unit, which could only be effective with its own territorial unit. Regarding Sikh political participation as an integral to Sikh theology itself, as the Khalsa had been established in 1699 to organize religious Sikhs into a political community, one of Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s signature contributions to Sikhism, the party received strong support from its base by offering this political organization rooted in religious tradition.

The Cabinet Mission Plan had recognized Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs as the three main communities. Both Congress and the Muslim League had offered allurements to woo the Sikhs to their respective nations. On 5 August 1944, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in an attempt to retain all of Punjab, had assured the Sikhs of full rights and addressal of claims; he and Liaqat Ali Khan had offered a Sikh state within Pakistan with its own military establishment. Countering this, Vallabhbhai Patel had reaffirmed on 24 August 1945, the Congress Resolution of 1929 and promised on 5 April 1946: &quot;Sikhistan issue will be considered in the Constituent Assembly after the transfer of power in the hands of the Indians.&quot; The Sikh leadership had opposed partition, but would opt for India based on the promises made by Hindu leaders like Nehru, Gandhi, and Patel in 1929, 1946 and 1947.

In 1946, the Akali Dal had submitted a memorandum to the British government in which it asserted that Pakistan should not be conceded to the Muslims without at the same time conceding a sovereign Sikh nation as well, a sentiment echoed until independence by Akali leaders, who adopted a resolution in favour of one in March 1946, variously referred to as Sikhistan or Khalistan. When Sikh statehood was rejected by the commission, sections of the Sikh community instead began to advocate for a homeland within the Indian Union.

===Independence===
Though it was commonly recognized at the time of independence that the Indian states were created not on a rational basis, but were the result of the exigencies of the progressive British conquest of the subcontinent, and Congress had been advocating the reorganization of provinces for over a quarter century prior, a commission that had been set up in 1948 by the Government of India, tasked with drawing up clean-cut states corresponding to demographic and linguistic boundaries, was not effective in the northern part of the country, as it reconsidered its position on the north. While states across the country were extensively redrawn on linguistic lines at the behest of linguistic groups, the only languages not considered for statehood were Punjabi, Sindhi and Urdu. Its jurisdiction was limited to the southern states, with northern India kept out of its purview, specifically to avoid problems like those of Punjab, in particular issues raised by the Sikhs.

====Ambedkar====
In January 1948, Akali Dal&#x27;s three-member delegation of leaders, Harcharan Singh Bajwa, Bhupinder Singh Mann, and Giani Kartar Singh, met the Minister of Law and Justice Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. Ambedkar suggested that the Akali delegation demand a Punjabi-speaking state (Punjabi Suba) as a Sikh state, since the central government had declared a commitment to a linguistic basis for the reorganization of the states.

===Akali platform===
The Sikh population, after the partition of Punjab, had become a majority population in a contiguous, strategic land area for the first time in its history, with a new socio-political position, This enabled the Akali Dal to focus on expressing unencumbered Sikh political needs, free from the politics of the former Muslim majority that had needed to be accommodated on its political platform prior to it, and provided the opportunity for Sikhs themselves to express a degree of autonomy from the sway of the Congress party and the central government, through the Akali Dal.

The Sikhs now constituted a majority in the northwestern seven districts of the thirteen districts of East Punjab state at the time: Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Firozpur, Ludhiana, and Ambala, along with Patiala and East Punjab States Union, or PEPSU, which had been formed as an administrative unit on 5 May 1948 including the six Sikh princely states, and with sizable populations in surrounding districts.

Meanwhile, Hindus formed a majority in the remaining six districts, including the southeastern districts between PEPSU and Delhi (Hisar, Karnal, Rohtak, and Gurgaon), and the eastern Kangra and Shimla divisions. In addition, while the Sikhs made up 35% of the province&#x27;s population, the demographic pattern of urban and rural settlement was such that the Hindu population, whose majority status was new, was largely clustered in urban areas. The seven Sikh-majority districts would be the suggested basis of the Punjabi Suba, for which Tara Singh campaigned vigorously between late 1948 and early 1949.

On 30 May 1948, a delegate session of the Akali Dal meeting at Amritsar had passed a resolution rejecting the party&#x27;s merger into the Congress, electing Tara Singh as president of the revived party. On 2 August 1948, at a press conference at Delhi, Tara Singh demanded the linguistic reorganisation of East Punjab, for the creation of a Punjabi-speaking state. On 25 August, he announced that the goals of the movement would also include Sikh recruitment to the Indian Army, safeguarding Sikh rights and interests in PEPSU, Punjabi as the language of institutions and the medium of education, and the allotment of land and property to Partition refugees equivalent to what they possessed before.

====PEPSU====
PEPSU was formally inaugurated on 15 July 1948 by Sardar Patel, who in his address described PEPSU, with a strong Sikh majority, as a &quot;homeland of the Sikhs&quot;. The interim government would be led by the Maharaja of Patiala, Yadvinder Singh, as &quot;rajpramukh&quot;, or appointed governor, and the Maharaja of Kapurthala Jagatjit Singh as deputy &quot;rajpramukh&quot;. A later 3-person caretaker government was formed with Gian Singh Rarewala as Premier, and Hindu ministers as Adviser (Sir Jai Lal) and Chief Secretary (B.R. Patel); this would be reworked following Akali protests for proportional administrative representation on 13 January 1949 with a ministry under Rarewala with 4 Sikh ministers and 3 Hindu ministers, sworn in on the 20th. However, it would be dissolved on 18 November that year when the Central Government took over administration, a move that was condemned by an Akali resolution on 28 November.

===Constitution===
The new platform of the Akali Dal mobilized strong support among Sikhs, and the Akali Dal passed a resolution in October 1948 in favor of continuing distinct representation of the Sikh minority through a Punjabi Suba, to protect against the aggressive communal mentality displayed by some in the majority if weightage or reservation for Sikhs in the Constituent Assembly was not possible, though a decision adopted by the Congress in its annual session held in December 1948 read, &quot;We are clearly of the opinion that no question of rectification of the boundaries in Northern India should be raised at the present moment whatever the merits of such a proposal.&quot;

The Congress leadership, including Nehru and Gandhi, had passed a resolution in its December 1929 annual Lahore session, stating that no national constitution framed after the transfer of power would be passed unless acceptable to the Sikhs, and Congress leader had reiterated their promise to provide maximal provincial autonomy in the new country as the Akalis would vote for partition on 23 June 1947, confident that aspirations would be satisfied through &quot;the goodwill of the Congress and the majority community,&quot; relinquishing their bargaining power to join the Indian Union in doing so. A July 1947 resolution for Partition that had been passed by Sikh and Hindu members of the Punjab Legislative Assembly stated that in the Indian portion of Punjab, &quot;special constitutional measures are imperative to meet just aspirations and rights of the Sikhs.&quot;

Nehru had been quoted in the 9 January 1930 edition of the &quot;Lahore Bulletin&quot; during the freedom struggle, and as late as July 1946 at the All India Congress Committee in Calcutta, that &quot;the brave Sikhs of Punjab are entitled to special considerations. I see nothing wrong in an area set up in the North of India wherein the Sikhs can also experience the glow of freedom,&quot; though afterwards telling the Sikhs after the British left that the &quot;circumstances had now changed.&quot; He had also strongly rejected the formation of Punjabi-speaking areas into a separate state when Lord Mountbatten had forwarded the suggestion from Baldev Singh and Giani Kartar Singh to him just prior to the Partition and population transfer.

====Rejection====
The Minority Committee formed by the Punjab Chief Minister made the case to the Assembly three weeks after the Akali resolution&#x27;s passing. The Assembly was against even proportional reservation as potentially yielding to the Sikhs more than their supposed fair share, even denying Sikh representatives of scheduled castes concessions given to Hindu scheduled castes, which would be rescinded upon converting out. In his autobiography, Tara Singh would write that when meeting with Nehru for equal concessions to scheduled castes, Nehru admitted that he was &quot;helpless&quot; before the communalism displayed by Parliament members. Tara Singh would also ascribe this to the domination of anti-Sikh communalists, particularly the Arya Samaj, in the &quot;Punjab Congress, the Punjab press, the Punjab Legislative Assembly and all other spheres of political power,&quot; considering them to be &quot;dup[ing]&quot; Hindus outside Punjab.

Tara Singh himself was arrested on 20 February 1949 and imprisoned for several months, during which time the agitation was continued under the leadership of Sardar Hukam Singh, who in early 1950 described the demand for a Punjabi-speaking state as both secular and democratic. The Working Committee of the Akali Dal passed a resolution in May supporting a state based on Punjabi language and culture.

Sikh members of the Assembly would refuse to sign the draft constitution to be enacted on 26 January 1950. In addition, the Akali delegation maintained that the measure of provincial autonomy afforded in the document did not match prior assurances, and the demarcation of provinces in the North was specifically delayed to deprive Sikhs of a political foothold in their own homeland of Punjab. On these grounds, the two Akali delegates in the Constitutional Assembly, Hukam Singh and Bhupinder Singh Mann, did not sign the constitution in 1950, stating that &quot;the Sikhs do not accept this constitution; the Sikhs reject this constitutional Act.&quot; Hukam Singh would state to the Assembly on 21 November 1949:

==Early efforts (1949-1955)==
===1949 Sachar Formula===
The Sachar Formula was introduced on 2 October 1949 under the government of Bhim Sen Sachar to forestall the growing agitation. Drafted by two Hindu members and two Sikh members of the Congress party, it proposed making Punjabi as the medium of instruction up to the matriculation stage in the &quot;Punjabi zone&quot; area, with Hindi taught as a compulsory subject from the end of the primary level onward, and vice versa for &quot;Hindi zone&quot; areas. The &quot;Punjabi zone&quot; consisted of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ferozpur, and Ludhiana districts, along with Hisar district north of the Ghaggar river, and the Ropar and Kharar tehsils of Ambala district. Its goal had been mutual bilingualism, but as it divided East Punjab into Punjabi and Hindi zones, it had the effect of sharpening the divide between the majority Sikh north and majority Hindu south.

====Opposition====
=====Arya Samaj=====
The Arya Samaj led the forces of Hindu communalism against the Akali Dal. While earlier in June 1948, both Punjabi and Hindi were both made official media of educational instruction, the Municipal Committee of Jalandhar in February 1949 resolved to make Devanagari Hindi the sole media in its schools, and the Senate of Panjab University, then Punjab&#x27;s only university, passed a resolution on 9 June refusing to use Punjabi in any script as a medium of instruction; both were strongholds of the Arya Samaj, which, supported by its Jan Sangh and Hindu Mahasabha allies, would never accept the formula or implement it in its schools. Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel, writing to Nehru on 17 July 1949, bolstered the opposition by stating that Punjabi was not a language but a dialect, with no willingness on the part of the people to adopt it.

After failed efforts to absorb the Sikhs, and with the slogan of &quot;Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan,&quot; Hindu organizations opted to spurn the language so that the Sikhs would be considered a linguistic minority as well as a religious minority, and thus prevent the formation of a state which would be Sikh-majority. To undercut the linguistic basis of the demand, the Arya Samaj embarked on a newspaper propaganda campaign to encourage the Hindus of even the Punjabi-speaking area to disown Punjabi entirely and select Hindi in censuses beginning in early 1951. Falsifications by census officials also led to clashes at several locations, prompting the Prime Minister to place a moratorium on linguistic data collection.

This repudiation of Punjabi would be repeated in the 1961 census ten years later, and half of the demographic would continue to select Hindi even after the movement in the 1971 census.

=====Akali Dal=====
While many Akalis leaders were initially receptive to the formula, and Tara Singh was released at its introduction in the hopes that the formula would be accepted by the party, Tara Singh turned it down, reminding the Congress of its commitment to forming linguistic states, and that a Punjabi-speaking region had already been demarcated for the purposes of the Sachar Formula itself. The Akali Dal would hold its first major protest demonstration in August 1950.

In response to the Hindi opposition, the Akali Dal mobilized the Sikhs of the region. This competition led to several clashes in Punjab, and heated electoral campaigns by the Akali Dal and Congress through to 1952; Congress would go on to win the election, but by forming and leading a coalition called the United Front with other opposition parties, the Akali Dal would go on to form the first non-Congress government of India in PEPSU in April 1952. Before the United Front could elect a new leader after Gian Singh Rarewala, Congress would dissolve the Assembly under President&#x27;s Rule, implementing changes in administration including the removal of the Sikh Chief Secretary and the two Sikh Deputy Commissioners, to avert any efforts toward a Punjabi state, opposed by Nehru

In August 1952, the Akali Dal would position itself as the premier representative for Sikh rights, broadcasting its victory in the subsequent annual elections and dislodging of the pro-Congress president of the Dal as a referendum for support for the Punjabi Suba among the Sikhs. The merging of PEPSU into the Punjabi-speaking region was also advocated in December by Tara Singh to further ensure Sikh territorial unity within the proposed Suba. The Akali Dal criticized Congress in its handling of PEPSU in relation to the designated Punjabi-speaking area, though the Congress announcement on 27 December 1953 of another States Reorganization Commission undercut accusations of division, and Congress retained control in the PEPSU elections in January 1954.

===1953 States Reorganisation Commission (SRC)===
Though the calls for a Punjabi Suba were initially disregarded by the central government, the problem did not subside, and another States Reorganization Commission was set up in 1953. Stemming from new nationwide momentum for linguistic states, it was charged with &quot;&#x27;investigat[ing] the conditions of the problem, the historical background, the existing situations and the bearing of all relevant important factors thereon.&quot;

Five days before the announcement, in the wake of President&#x27;s Rule, during the mid-term polls of 1953, Nehru had come to campaign to a Sikh congregation at Fatehgarh Sahib on the occasion of Saka Sirhind; due to his firm opposition to the Punjabi Suba, he was prevented from using the observance to electioneer, with a group lead by former MLA Atma Singh going on stage to prevent him from speaking. Considered a &quot;national insult&quot; by some Hindus, this would affect the composition of the SRC; while Punjabi statehood was the most controversial issue, no Sikhs were appointed for it.

The commission began its work in February 1954, and the Akali Dal submitted an 18-page memorandum on 14 May 1954, proposing the Punjabi Suba to include all of Punjab, PEPSU, and the Punjabi-speaking northern parts of Rajasthan, and to exclude the districts of Gurgaon and Rohtak, Panipat Tehsil in Karnal, and a few tehsils of Hisar district, which were to merge with Hindi-speaking regions. The Akalis drafted their case with care, strictly on the basis of language and using pre-1947 census figures, to present the proposed Punjabi-speaking state of an area over 35,000 square miles; they were supported in their effort by parties advocating rural interests, and complemented other linguistic state demands in the region. In a manifesto, the Akali Dal proposed that the establishment of a Punjabi state would enable education, administration, and cultural preservation in the language:
The Congress in Punjab, on the other hand, proposed the state integration of East Punjab, PEPSU, and Himachal Pradesh, which was similar to the submitted memoranda of the Arya Samaj and the Jan Sangh, which had proposed the amalgamation of not only these territories but even Delhi as well, and had both insisted paradoxically that citizens of India could &quot;choose&quot; their mother-tongue.

This prompted the Akalis to organize a forceful agitation in response. According to Tara Singh, the script, language, culture, religion, and existence of the Sikhs were under zealous attack by Arya Samaji fanatical elements in order to wipe out their identity and thereby subsume them, and that the only safeguard against this was a state in which Sikhs held effective political power. Earlier Sikh movements had achieved, in large part, significant demarcation from the Hindus, preserving themselves as a distinct religious and political entity. The Punjabi Suba was also seen as a means to prevent Sikh religious apathy, and resultant backsliding into Hinduism, on the basis of shared religious postulates and cultural kinship, after considerable repudiation of traditional beliefs during the 19th century formation of Hindu identity by reformist neo-Hindus like the Arya Samaj, including the rejection of polytheism, idol and &quot;avatar&quot; worship, temple offerings, pilgrimages, the widow remarriage prohibition, child marriage, sati, and Brahmin priestcraft. Such repudiations had often converged with the earlier ones of Sikhism, though instead leading to competition between the two factions in Punjab and consequently North India.

The Akali Dal entered the 1955 Punjab SGPC elections on this platform and won resoundingly, winning all 110 seats it contested against the Punjab Congress, which had contested under the banner of the &quot;Khalsa Dal,&quot; which had only won 3 out of 132 contested seats. The results proved a strong morale booster for the party, which had demonstrated strong Sikh support for its platform, and felt encouraged to start a movement for the Punjabi Suba. The opportunity presented itself when on 6 April 1955 the Punjab Congress banned the shouting of Punjabi Suba slogans; twenty days later the Akali Dal issued an ultimatum to rescind the ban by 10 May or face an agitation.

===1955 slogan agitation===
Following the slogan ban imposed by the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar, the Akalis commenced the Punjabi Suba slogan agitation of 1955. Large numbers of summoned volunteers congregated at the Darbar Sahib in Amritsar from demonstrations all over the province, thus reviving the protest methods of the Akali movement of the 1920s. The SGPC, which provided logistical and organizational support for Sikh politics, significantly bolstered the party&#x27;s effectiveness.

The Congress government did not lift the slogan ban, and the agitation began as promised on 10 May, with Tara Singh and ten companions being arrested for shouting Punjabi Suba slogans, as were successive groups of Akalis as they embarked from the temple doing the same. In the next five days more than 1,000 prominent Akali leaders were arrested; in nearly two months, 12,000 Sikhs had been arrested for the Slogan Agitation, and by the end of July as many as 21,000 Akalis were jailed in Congress efforts to quash the growing movement, which nevertheless continued steadily. In several towns there were instances of Hindu communal organizations throwing stones and brickbats at Sikh processions. Thousands of volunteers were arrested for defying the ban on the slogan &quot;Punjabi Suba Zindabad&quot; (&quot;long live Punjabi State&quot;). Attempted negotiations with Congress led the agitation to be adjourned twice, though Jawaharlal Nehru continued to reject the demand.

====1955 Golden Temple raid====
A flashpoint during the agitation occurred on 4 July 1955, when a group led by Fateh Singh, who had joined the movement, had arrived from Ganganagar a few days prior to take part in the protest movement. The police cordoned off the complex, with the entry of people into the complex and Amritsar was stopped.

At night, government police forces, led by DIG Ashwini Kumar, forced their entry into the temple premises and heavyhandedly took the entire group into custody, along with the head granthis of the Akal Takht and Golden Temple, volunteer protestors, and even cooks of the temple&#x27;s langar. The Guru Ram Das Serai and Shiromani Akali Dal offices were also raided, and batons used and tear gas and shells fired to disperse the protestors gathered on the periphery of the temple, damaging the periphery and sarovar, or pool, of the temple. Supplies to the complex were cut off, all pilgrims staying at its rest houses were arrested, and Manji Sahib, where volunteers were sent daily to court arrest, was occupied. The government stopped volunteers on the way to the Golden Temple, and troops were ordered to flag-march through the bazaars and streets surrounding the site in a show of strength, though this would backfire as tension in the city increased, driving more volunteers to manage to reach the complex to keep the agitation going.

Thousands were arrested and injured. According to former Akal Takht jathedar Lakhbir Singh Rode, &quot;fire was opened at Akal Takht and Golden Temple, and many Sikhs were killed&quot;. The Tribune newspaper would comment, &quot;What overshadows the entire situation is that every weapon in the armoury of the Government has been brought into play. A great tragedy is being enacted in the Punjab... The Punjab is facing the greatest crisis in its history.&quot;

=====Aftermath=====
The reaction from this event gave further momentum to the movement, opposite to the intention of the government, and proved to be so potentially destabilizing to the government, provoking disaffection among the Sikh masses and in the army, that on 12 July, the government under Sachar used the pretext of a &quot;triumphal return from peace mission abroad&quot; to lift the ban on Punjabi Suba slogans, appealing for peace. Sachar himself personal apologized at the Akal Takht. It also announced the release of Akali prisoners in installments, which proved slow to be implemented; Tara Singh was released on 8 September, and the last Akalis were not released until 18 October.

Sachar received heavy criticism from fellow Congress members for the apology and for not &quot;taming&quot; the Akalis; he would subsequently resign, succeeded by Pratap Singh Kairon in January 1956.

===1955 SRC verdict===
The States Reorganization Committee submitted its report to the Government of India on 10 September 1955 where it was considered and published on 10 October.

In its 1955 report, the Commission admitted that the demand for a Punjabi-speaking state was analogous to the demand for other linguistic states, but rejected the demand even on its intrinsic merit. The Commission tried to turn down the demand for Punjab state being advanced based on the argument that the formation of linguistic-based provinces would spur other demands for the separation of other linguistic groups elsewhere; such claims had already been advanced by Sikhs, Jats, and other groups. The reasons cited in its report were that it did not recognize Punjabi as a distinct language, and that the movement lacked enough support amongst the Hindus of the proposed Punjabi-speaking state setting aside the criterion of language in favor of religious sentiments. For many, the former was a larger setback. Hukum Singh wrote, &quot;while others got States for their languages, we lost even our language,&quot; seeing it as &quot;another deadlier blow to the Sikhs.&quot; Giani Kartar Singh remarked that out of the 14 national languages of the Constitution, only Punjabi was left without a state.

With the language being distinct in grammar and lexicon, the Akali Dal regarded this reasoning as a pretext that amounted to religious discrimination, and that the demand would have been accepted without hesitation if the Sikhs were not set to be the majority. The commission also recommended the integration of Sikh-majority PEPSU, as well as Himachal Pradesh, with the Punjab, which was rejected by the Akali Dal a day after the report&#x27;s release; a Commission member reportedly remarked that if the Hindi-speaking areas were removed from Punjab, it would yield a Sikh-majority area, prompting accusations of discrimination from the Akalis, who saw the verdict as another majoritarian maneuver to contain the Sikhs. Tara Singh regarded the verdict as a &quot;decree of Sikh annihilation,&quot; believing that if there were no Sikhs, a Punjabi state would have been granted like other linguistic states had been. To him, its refusal was tantamount to religious discrimination.

Resolving to start a passive resistance movement, he took the opportunity to exhibit Sikh unity and resolution on this point, summoning a representative convention of Sikhs of all parties and organizations at Amritsar on 16 October 1955; nearly 1,300 invitees attended.

===Amritsar Convention===
The Amritsar convention strongly rejected the commission&#x27;s proposal, castigating it for bias against Sikh claims, as the commission&#x27;s recommendation was fully in accord with the most extreme elements opposing the Punjabi Suba, and even the Sachar Resolution, acknowledged as never even having been adhered to by those elements, was eroded.

The resolution of the Amritsar Convention stated in part, &quot;this convention of the Sikhs view with alarm and great resentment the complete and callous resolution of the States Reorganisation Commission of the just and reasonable demand for a Punjabi-speaking state.&quot; The resolution called on the government to create the Punjabi Suba not only in the interest of the Sikhs but in the interest of the Hindi-speaking peoples of East Punjab; Tara Singh received authorization from the Amritsar Convention &quot;to take suitable steps to for conveying the views and sentiments of the Sikh community to Government of India and urging them to do their duty to the Sikhs;&quot; his first action was to arrange a conciliatory meeting with the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who had previously been a strong advocate of linguistic states.

The meeting was facilitated by Baldev Singh, a former cabinet minister, who presented Nehru with correspondence between Sikh leaders and the Muslim League, reminding him that the Sikhs had rejected the League&#x27;s overtures to side with India. Baldev Singh would act as a mediator between the Akali leaders and the government in their meetings.

==Compromises and countermovements (1956-1960)==
The first meeting took place on 24 October 1955 in Delhi between the government, represented by Nehru and two of his senior cabinet colleagues, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant, and the Sikhs, represented by Master Tara Singh, who would present opening statements, Bhai Jodh Singh, also a member of the Chief Khalsa Diwan, who would explain the language problem, Giani Kartar Singh and Sardar Hukam Singh, who were to meet the political points, and Sardar Gian Singh Rarewala; a second meeting followed on 23 November the same year.

Following the 1955 Golden Temple raid, Sachar had faced heavy internal criticism for apologising to the Akalis instead of &quot;taming&quot; them; following his resignation, Partap Singh Kairon would succeed him in January 1956.

Further meetings were put on hold in December due to the announcement of a general session of the Congress Party to be held on 11 February 1956 in Amritsar; the Shiromani Akali Dal&#x27;s announcement of its own parallel congress, the orderly five-hour-long procession of which dwarfed in size that of the Congress convention, provided another show of Sikh solidarity, with a large turnout of Sikhs from all over Punjab and beyond, with conservative estimates of over 100,000 marchers. Nehru biographer and contemporary observer Michael Brecher estimated the figure to be over double that, as many as half a million, with participants being old and young, men and women, with many of them wearing the traditional Akali symbols of the kirpan and the blue turban, and observed the processioners raising chants of &quot;Punjabi Suba Zindabad&quot; (&quot;Long live a Punjabi State&quot;) and &quot;Master Tara Singh Zindabad,&quot; with intermittent music. The success of the Akali march helped talks with the government to resume, after an invite from Nehru.

===1956 Regional Formula===
Eventually both parties managed to break the impasse with a preliminary compromise, based on a proposal first made in January 1956 by Hukam Singh and reached on the 22nd: while stopping short of a Punjabi Suba, the state would be split into two regions in what would be called the Regional Formula: Punjabi and Hindi, with each region having its own committee consisting of its own share of Punjabi legislators, with powers to deliberate on all matters except law and order, finance, and taxation. The region would remain bilingual, but Punjabi in Gurmukhi would be the &quot;regional&quot; language, and the official language of the &quot;Punjabi zone;&quot; additionally, the Punjab Government would set up a separate department for the development of Punjabi alongside the one for Hindi, the central government would finally encourage Punjabi like any other regional language, and only PEPSU, and not Himachal Pradesh, would be merged with Punjab.

Talks again stalled by 26 February 1956 after the Sikh delegation perceived a lack of action during the meetings, but were resumed after Joginder Singh, a Sikh parliamentarian from Uttar Pradesh, persuaded the Sikhs to rejoin the talks.

====Acceptance====
The Regional Formula was put to a vote at a general meeting of the Shiromani Akali Dal at Amritsar on 11 March 1956. There were critical voices raised, on grounds of constitutional propriety as well as the perceived inadequacy of the measure, and Giani Kartar Singh conceded that what was offered was not the Punjabi Suba of their conception. Nevertheless, leaders including him, Jodh Singh, and Sardar Ajit Singh advocated acceptance of it as the starting point, or tentative promise, of a Punjabi Suba. The Sikh-majority PEPSU was also merged with Punjab for the arrangement as per the States Reorganization Commission&#x27;s recommendation. Master Tara Singh, however, was apprehensive of accepting the measure, which would weaken the Akali negotiating position, though it would go into effect on 1 November 1956. In a resolution passed by the Akalis at their meeting of 30 September 1956:
On 23 September 1956 after approving the Regional Formula, the Akali Dal renounced its political programme, as part of its deal with Congress. Shifting its focus to the promotion of Sikh religious, educational, cultural, social and economic interests, and protecting Sikh fundamental rights, it was proposed that its large number of politically active members, including Giani Kartar Singh, be presented to Congress to further Akali political goals by joining and working through Congress. However, when the Congress assigned the Akali entrants 22 nominations for the Punjab Assembly and 3 for Parliament, Master Tara Singh, though now on good terms with Nehru, considered this as grossly inadequate, and considered the settlement void as far as he was concerned, though the Akali Dal continued to abide by it. Among the options left to him were to put up his own candidates against the Congress, which proved unsuccessful, and to politically reactivate the Shiromani Akali Dal, which he still controlled and set out to do.

====Opposition to the Formula====
While each regional committee, consisting of ministers and legislators, were to have special powers to advise the state government and assembly, this &quot;unworkable&quot; arrangement would collapse amidst conflicting interpretations of the extent of these powers, and mutual accusations of bad faith between the state government and the Akali Dal. As a result, it was never fully implemented by the state government.

Languages had been communalised far before independence, when Hindi was selected to be the symbol of Hindu nationalism, regardless of whose actual native language it was. The Arya Samaj had introduced Devanagari as the vehicle of Hindu education in Punjab in the late 19th century, along with an artificial, heavily Sanskritized Hindi &quot;divested as far as possible&quot; from the colloquial Punjabi of the masses. Hindi advocates would variably count non-Hindi languages as &quot;dialects&quot; to inflate the count of Hindi speakers as the national level, while trying to overpower such languages at the state level; the expansion and contraction of what was conveniently considered Hindi stemmed from its usage as a tool in political conflicts.

===1957 Hindi agitation===
Hindi language supporters of Punjab, including Punjabi Hindus opposing the formation of a Sikh-majority state, resisted the Regional Formula. The Arya Samaj regarded the Regional Formula as worse than the Sachar Formula they had ignored earlier, and led the campaign to have it annulled, as the Punjabi-speaking &quot;region&quot; did not retain the Hindi option in the area for parents who wished to &quot;choose&quot; it as their language, which would have impinged on the unilingual character of the Punjabi Zone. Its leadership and that of the Jan Sangh formed the Hindi Raksha Samiti (&quot;Save Hindi&quot; Committee), supported by Arya Samaji newspaper editors, educational board members, and others, as the Arya Samaj controlled a large number of educational institutions.

On 30 April 1957, Swami Atmanand Saraswati, the octogenarian leader of the agitation, launched it by sitting in indefinitely at the Secretariat at Chandigarh. According to him, the push to have Punjabi receive status in the Punjabi region was used to &quot;gain political power,&quot; while Hindi was being &quot;relegated to a secondary position,&quot; in an appeasing affront to what he called the &quot;national language.&quot; Founded by the Jan Sangh for the purposes of the agitation, the Hindi Raksha Samiti&#x27;s charter made five main demands: 
*the medium of instruction in the educational institutions should be left entirely to the choice of the parents (the main demand);
*no compulsion to teach either language as a second language at any particular stage; 
*Hindi should replace English at all levels of administration; 
*official notifications up to the district level should be in both Devanagari and Gurmukhi; and 
*there should be one language &quot;formula&quot; in the whole state of Punjab, as opposed to &quot;Punjabi zone&quot; and &quot;Hindi zone&quot; formulas.

The Government quickly conceded the demand for bilingual government notifications up to the district level to the Hindi movement. Such concessions to their communal demands compromised the strictly linguistic nature of the Regional Formula.

The Hindi agitation was opposed to the formation of either Punjabi or Hindi linguistic states carved out of East Punjab. Far from any linguistic basis, the goal was specifically to create a greater Punjab in order to maintain a Hindu majority, and thus contain Sikh influence in the state&#x27;s politics and assure Hindu dominance. The communal strategy also linked Hindi with Hindu demands, in order to draw support from other Hindu-oriented Hindi movements in other states.

The movement quickly spread all over the Hindi area of East Punjab, with neighboring Hindi-speaking states sending large numbers of volunteers. About 30,000 participants took part against the Punjab Congress government, with 6,000 arrested by November for violating law and order.

Explicitly anti-Sikh language was used by the communalists. The Hindi Rakshi Samiti, while in Punjab, would launch anti-Punjabi slogans like &quot;langri bhasha nahin parhenge, gandi bhasha nahin parhenge, jabri bhasha nahin parhenge&quot; (&quot;we won&#x27;t study a crippled language, we won&#x27;t study a dirty language, we won&#x27;t study a language made obligatory&quot;); at Ambala and Yamunanagar, &quot;Ura Aira nahin parhenge, gandi bhasha nahin parhenge&quot; (&quot;we shall not read the script of (Punjabi,) a filthy language&quot;); at Patiala by Swami Rameshwaranand, &quot;kainchi ustra karo tiar&quot; (&quot;Ready the scissors and razors&quot;); at Jagadhri, leader Sohan Lal Tiwari had uttered, &quot;If the Sikhs wish to live here, they shall have to shave off and take Hindu appearance.&quot; Such behavior from the Hindi agitation until the end of the movement would leave lasting bitterness in Punjab.

During the course of the seven-month-long movement, several Sikh gurdwaras had been desecrated. Cigarette packets had been thrown into the pool of the Golden Temple in early July, and again on 24 December containing a poster threatening Sikhs, into a Patiala gurdwara in on 10 August, and into a Hissar gurdwara on 13 September. Pages of the Guru Granth Sahib were torn and strewn on a road in Amritsar on 1 August. The new Congress government, which had commenced on 3 April 1957 and was headed by Partap Singh Kairon as Chief Minister and former Akalis and current cabinet members Giani Kartar Singh and Gian Singh Rarewala who served under him, dealt with it harshly.

Nevertheless, the Hindi agitation provided Kairon with a pretext for delaying implementation of the Regional Formula, after which the Hindi agitation was withdrawn on 23 December 1957.

====Akali response====
The Akali Dal Working Committee, during its 8 September 1957 meeting, described the Hindi agitation as violent, vulgar, and abusive &quot;hooliganism&quot; rather than a satyagraha, noting that its leader had threatened marches on gurdwaras if Congress youth sat in on Arya Samaj temples, agitators had assaulted the persons of Sikhs, gurdwaras and Sikh scriptures had been desecrated, and that the central government had done nothing until &quot;the Sikhs, giving up hopes of protection by the police and the Government, began to move and organise themselves for self-protection.&quot; Calling upon the government to stop yielding to and placating such hooliganism, he encouraged the Sikhs to stand firm.

Sikh sentiments remained hurt by the violent desecrations, the Sikh masses had not enthusiastically accepted the Regional Formula either, and though the post-independence intellectual and cultural context that had driven Punjabi advocacy and the initial drive toward the Formula did yield efforts for Punjabi University in 1956, the Formula was increasingly viewed as an inadequate solution to the Punjab problem, with neither the government or the political parties seeing potential in it.

The replacement of the Regional Formula became even more imperative for the central authorities with growing opposition to the usage of Punjabi and Gurmukhi among Punjabi Hindus even in the Punjabi zone, who &quot;frequently&quot; preferred Devanagari script alongside Hindi in place of what was regarded as an &quot;arrogant&quot; imposition. Many Sikhs would agree with Tara Singh&#x27;s sentiments however, that a unilingual Punjabi state was just and justifiable on the same linguistic basis recognized in the formation of other states, and was not being done due to what the Akalis regarded as the central government&#x27;s fundamental lack of trust in Sikhs. In a pamphlet, he expressed his view that:

An outcome of the Hindi agitation was the revival of the Punjabi Suba movement, amidst growing fears of Hindi and Hindu domination. While the Akali Dal supported the Formula until March 1958, Tara Singh stated in June that he would be compelled to restart the Punjabi Suba struggle if the Resolution was not implemented, holding a Punjabi Province conference in October. Language frontiers had become communal frontiers, and Master Tara Singh considered the Punjabi Suba as the only solution against rising Hindi fanaticism. He called a general meeting of the Shiromani Akali Dal at Patiala on 14 February 1959, which 299 out of 377 members attended. The convention strongly supported restoring the political operation of the Akali Dal.

====Aftermath====
The movement&#x27;s openly militant Hindu revivalist stance, its violent attitudes and methods, and heavy usage of Hindi speakers from outside Punjab as agitators was strongly criticized across the country. Observed by non-Hindi language movement leaders, one South Indian anti-Hindi leader remarked that all non-Hindi speakers &quot;&quot;should take a lesson from what is happening in Punjab;&quot; there had also been a struggle for cultural preservation in Tamil Nadu against Hindi imposition that same year.

Even after their withdrawal, Hindi-language activists in Punjab and Hindu nationalist leaders outside the state remained committed to mobilizing their marshalled resources in future movements. The movement had served a range of political interests, including for Hindu Congress leaders despite the movement having been against their party, one had been the demand for 50% political appointment share from the Hindi areas, leading to inter-Congress factionalism; instead of making such demands from their party, this &quot;Haryana faction&quot; used the movement to &quot;harass the [Congress] government&quot; to avenge their defeat within their own party.

=====Haryana Lok Samiti=====
One such future outgrowth, the Haryana Lok Samiti, characterized the struggle as a &quot;&quot;dharam yudh&quot;, a battle with Sikhs,&quot; and a &quot;war between &quot;dharam&quot; and &quot;adharam&quot; (righteousness and unrighteousness), between Hindi and Punjabi, between Haryana and Sikhistan,&quot; refused to learn Gurmukhi as Hindi was &quot;the national language,&quot; vowed to &quot;fight against Sikhs&quot; and &quot;finish Sikhs from Punjab,&quot; described 1.5 million Sikh refugees as &quot;thieves&quot; and &quot;worse than Muslims,&quot; boasted of their Arya Samaj affiliation, threatened &quot;adharmi&quot; Pratap Singh Kairon with assault even though he was also against a Punjabi Suba, and repeatedly chanted anti-Sikh and Hindu nationalist songs in Chandigarh meetings, which was &quot;highly provocative and created bitter feelings among Sikhs.&quot; According to the 1962 Election Commission, the &quot;real object&quot; of the Arya Samaj leaders who were the chief organizers of the 1957 agitation had been to &quot;promote feelings of enmity and hatred between the Sikhs and Hindus of Punjab on the grounds of religion and language,&quot; and then to exploit those divisions in future elections, as in 1962.

=====Golwalkar=====
Through 1960, in preparation for the 1961 linguistic census, the Jan Sangh and the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha continued to publish propaganda that again encouraged the state&#x27;s Hindus to register their mother tongue as Hindi, as in 1951. These efforts were undercut by RSS chief M. S. Golwalkar, who in a meeting in Jalandhar, Punjab in 1960 declared that &quot;Punjabi is the mother tongue of every Punjabi.&quot; Jan Sangh leadership would meet him in Ambala to urge him to amend of withdraw his statement, though he would not do so, which discouraged the delegation from pursuing another Hindi agitation with the same fervour.

During partition times, his fellow partisan V. N. Savarkar had supported the formation of &quot;a Sikhistan in the Punjab.&quot;

=====Kairon=====
Partap Singh Kairon, though himself an advocate of the Punjabi language and the eventual 1962 founding of the Punjabi University for the support and development of the language along with Giani Kartar Singh, opposed the formation of either a Punjabi state or a Hindi state, like the Hindi agitation had. His own father Nihal Singh had been a prominent figure in the Singh Sabha enlightenment, the influence of which his own cultural perceptions and affiliations to Punjab and Sikhism had been moulded; he would refer to his proud Singh Sabha upbringing both privately and publicly. He pressed for the establishment of the university, though he repressed Akali influence in favour of bringing Congress influence into rural Punjab; politically active Akalis were still working through Congress per their earlier agreement during this time, joining during his leadership. Congress controlled 120 seats in the legislature out of 164, with 58 Sikhs among them, with nearly 50 representing the Punjabi &quot;region,&quot; which had 71 seats total, though former Akali Sikhs were underrepresented compared to Congress Sikhs, and Tara Singh was not satisfied with the number of tickets given to former Akalis, regarding which he had not been consulted.

===Goodwill Committee===
Following the Hindi agitation, the Chief Minister appointed a &quot;Sidh Bhawna&quot; (&quot;Goodwill&quot;) Committee, ostensibly for &quot;promoting good relations between the communities,&quot; but rather taking upon itself the function of a language committee, centered on a single proposal for the language problem: making Punjabi digraphic with Gurmukhi and Devanagari, with its members specifically selected to support this foregone proposal.

While the Regional Formula had already delineated a Punjabi Zone with Gurmukhi as the language&#x27;s exclusive and historical script, the new strategy sought to fundamentally change the language. The Sikhs saw no grounds for this committee, as per the Regional Formula, any change in the existing arrangements was to be made only with the consent of the concerned parties, and they saw the attempt to graft another script on Punjabi as an attack on their religious and cultural identity. Even Nehru pushed back on this, stating:

A subsequent 26-member Language Committee assembled by the state government in 1960 and espousing the same solution, was, like the &quot;Sidh Bhawna&quot; Committee, appointed under threats from Hindi agitators. Both committees were seen by the Sikhs as attempts to negate the Sachar and Regional Formulas that were earlier agreed to.

An SGPC resolution in March 1960 boycotted the Language Committee, stating that &quot;the only solution of the linguistic trouble of Punjab is to bifurcate Punjab on the basis of Punjabi and Hindi.&quot;

==Renewed efforts (1960-61)==
The Punjab Government under Kairon remained as politically firm dealing with rival supporters of Punjabi as it had done over the supporters of Hindi, and the political rivalry between Congress and the Akali Dal resulted in the narrow loss of Master Tara Singh in the election for the office of president of the SGPC to another Akali candidate, Prem Singh Lalpura. Tara Singh reacted by arranging a Punjabi Suba conference in Chandigarh, at which he announced his intention of launching a mass movement. He was subsequently arrested, though a silent procession in Delhi on 15 March 1959 proceeded as arranged; the procession, with portraits of Tara Singh, ended in a religious &quot;divan&quot; at Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib, and Tara Singh was released from jail in under a week.

While in November 1958 Kairon narrowly dislodged Tara Singh from the SGPC presidency, his subsequent unconstitutional attempt to dilute the SGPC&#x27;s democracy under the action of accommodating PEPSU representatives in the SGPC earned strong opposition from non-Congress Sikhs, which Tara Singh capitalized on by announcing another SGPC bid on the platform of the Punjabi Suba, securing the presidency and 132 out of 139 seats for the Akali Dal. The 1960 election was another contest between Kairon&#x27;s Congress and Tara Singh&#x27;s Akalis. Congress Sikhs worked to defeat the Akalis; Giani Kartar Singh even resigned from his ministry to focus solely on campaigning, and with help from the state government created the Sadh Sangat Board to contest the elections.

===Reviving the movement===
Regardless, spurred by the electorate&#x27;s sentiment against the conduct of the 1957 Hindi agitation, the Akalis under Tara Singh swept back into power in the 1960 SGPC elections. Taking 136 seats to the Sadh Sangat Board&#x27;s four; following this, all the Akali members assembled at the Akal Takht on 24 January 1960 to pledge to resume the Punjabi Suba struggle. Following a 10 May announcement from Tara Singh echoing this, another Punjabi Suba convention was held on 22 May 1960, to which members of the Swatantra Party and Praja Socialist Party were invited. Presided over by Pandit Sundar Lal and former Congress member Saifuddin Kitchlew, the main resolution was moved by Sardar Gurnam Singh, calling upon the government &quot;not to delay any more the inevitable formation&quot; of a Punjabi-speaking state, especially when language-based states had been carved out in other parts of the country.

The attendance of Indian Muslim leaders from Delhi like Kitchlew led Darbara Singh, the President of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, to characterize the convention on 9 October 1960 as a conspiracy between Tara Singh and Pakistan to create trouble in the state, wildly alleging that Tara Singh and Ayub Khan planned to have Akalis trained in guerilla warfare in Pakistan. After the convention ended, the government began arresting Akali leaders. Tara Singh was arrested and detained in jail under the 1950 Preventive Detention Act on the night of 24 May and detained in Kangra, and the government cracked down heavy-handedly on the Akalis, with large-scale arrests made throughout the Punjab, including many other Akali leaders and legislators, and lines of arrests at Amritsar, at which the Golden Temple was the main center of mobilization, and Delhi. About 500 preemptive arrests were made, though several top Akalis, including Fateh Singh, Harcharan Singh Hudiara, and Jiwan Singh Umranangal, managed to make it to Amritsar.

With the movement again gaining momentum, another march was announced to commence on 29 May 1960, going through the Punjabi countryside to end at Delhi to join a Sikh procession on 12 June 1960, stopping at important Gurdwaras to make speeches to rally support for the Punjabi Suba. Starting from the Akal Takht as scheduled, the 12 June procession was arrested a few miles from Amritsar. Daily processions of 11 Sikhs from Amritsar from 30 May onward marched to court arrest, and a procession was planned from Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Delhi.

The central government banned the procession on 9 June, sealing Delhi&#x27;s borders to prevent their entry. A congregation of thousands of Delhi Sikhs at Gurdwara Sis Ganj was disrupted on 12 June by police, who used tear gas and batons in an attempt to disperse them. Nearly 18,000 Akalis courted arrest by July. Akali leaders made stirring speeches asserting the Sikhs’ right to self-determination, and the evening &quot;divans&quot;, or assemblies, at Manji Sahib attracted vast audiences. Nehru, recommending bilingualism for everyone in the province, continued to oppose its bifurcation, though Kairon would start to release some Akali protesters from jail to give the impression that they were easing their position. Four detainees would be killed in police fire while agitating for their release.

In its 21 July issue, the &quot;Statesman Calcutta&quot; warned, &quot;Eighteen thousand people in jails means a big drain on the state&#x27;s exchequer and a big loss of productive labour to the State&#x27;s economy. Nor does it mean present loss alone. Throttling of popular sentiment may generate explosive heat, which once it bursts can lay waste whole tracts.&quot; According to a 22 July &quot;Times of India&quot; editorial, &quot;The truth is that the situation in the State is far more serious than the government makes it out to be.&quot;

====Press suppression====
To suppress the spread of the movement, the government sealed and offices of two pro-Akali newspapers (the Punjabi-language &quot;Akali&quot; and the Urdu-language &quot;Parbhat&quot;) and detained their staff, though following objections of the All India Journalist Association against the curtailing of press freedom, were allowed to resume operation.

The government issued two measures to stifle the renascent movement: one banning newspapers from discussing Akali demands at the center of the movement, whether for or against them, and one setting heavy penalties against those evading arrest, or aiding or sheltering those who were.

====Punjabi University granted====
To undercut the agitation&#x27;s popular support, the Punjab Congress Government granted two concessions: declaring Punjabi in the Gurmukhi script as the official language of Punjab at district level effective 2 October 1960, and the appointment of a commission, headed by the Maharaja of Patiala and several academics, for the establishment of Punjabi University. Punjab Ekta Samiti, a Hindu communalist organization, protested on 23 September against these ordinances.

====Punjabi Suba Students Front====
On 22 September 1960, Inderjeet Singh, a 10-year-old boy from Moga visiting relatives in Karnal, would be beaten with batons, killed, and thrown in an irrigation well by policemen for raising slogans. The Akali Dal held a day in his honor on 24 September, and the killing spurred the formation of the Punjabi Suba Students Front on 26 September.

===Under Sant Fateh Singh===
With Tara Singh in jail, his second-in-command Sant Fateh Singh directed the movement from the Golden Temple in his absence, assisted by the Sikh Students Federation in delivering speeches drawing from Sikh history to garner support, in 1960.

A religious leader without a long political background, having been brought into politics by Tara Singh, Fateh Singh was nevertheless an effective leader, and presented the demand for the Punjabi Suba as based on linguistic considerations alone, bringing it in line with the country&#x27;s declared goals of democracy and secularism, and what was considered most important was the creation of a unit comprising all Punjabi-speaking areas, with Punjabi as the official language, over religious demography. He tactically stressed the linguistic basis of the demand, while downplaying its religious basis — a state where the distinct Sikh identity could be preserved, though, in regard to the additional significance of minority rights, stating, &quot;No status is given to the Punjabi language, because Sikhs speak it. If non-Sikhs had owned Punjabi as their mother tongue, then the rulers of India would have seen no objection in establishing a Punjabi State.&quot;

As a Jat Sikh, he held a strong constituency among, and furthered the shift in political power to, the rural peasantry and the gurdwaras. Rural Jatt Sikhs had felt politically disenfranchised from Akali leadership positions under Tara Singh during the three decades prior, which had been dominated by urban non-Jatts, as did Sikhs from the Malwa region in relation to those of Majha, as well as local Sikhs in relation to Partition refugee Sikhs.

The government resorted to rigorous measures to put down the agitation, but volunteers continued to join and the movement continued, even as thousands of Sikhs were put in jail.

===Bathinda Special Jail===
As the rate of volunteers courting arrest increased, government agents began infiltrating the jails in order to spread disinformation, demoralize the volunteers, and offer releases in exchange for solicited unconditional apologies. Jail officials misrepresented thumb marks signing apologies as for the purposes of railway passes; upon discovery of this, Akali prisoners began demanding notes stipulating that their releases were unconditional. Along with subpar conditions in the overcrowded Bathinda Special Jail, tensions in the prison increased, and on 9 October 1960, the use of signatures for apologies misrepresented as rail passes again came to light, and Akali prisoners refused to exit. Police, surrounding the jail, fired into the Akali mob, killing 4 protesters (Jaswant Singh, Chanchal Singh, Nazar Singh, and Ranjt Singh) and injuring 150.

The next day, a procession of 250 Sikhs from Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib, Patiala, protesting the Bathinda firing were themselves fired upon, killing two more (Dewan Singh, Hari Singh). The incidents lent to denunciations from several political parties of the state government&#x27;s tactics to suppress civil liberties, which threatened to worsen the political climate.

===Fateh Singh&#x27;s fast===
As for the central government, Nehru forcefully reiterated his position against the Punjabi Suba in a Delhi press conference on 21 October; on 17 November, while giving a speech at an agricultural college opening ceremony in Nainital, Sikh protesters released slogans for Punjabi Suba, at which he angrily stated that the Punjabi Suba had been left in Pakistan and taunted, &quot;go to your Punjabi Suba. Why are you here?&quot;

This outburst would harm his image further among Sikh circles, including the executive committee of the Chief Khalsa Diwan which reiterated the constitutional right to advocate for a unilingual state within the country without being called unpatriotic, Hukam Singh of the Akali leadership who denounced him forcefully as a &quot;Goebbelsian liar,&quot; and Fateh Singh, who on 29 October wrote that to Nehru that denying the Punjabi Suba closed all avenues for the legitimate demand, which left him no choice but to &quot;resort to fast unto death to prick [his] conscience,&quot; to begin on 9:00 a.m. on 18 December.

On 29 October 1960, Fateh Singh wrote to Jawaharlal Nehru saying that if the Sikhs’ democratic and constitutional demand for a Punjabi-speaking area was not accepted, he would go on a fast (a novelty in Sikh tradition), seeking to impress upon him the Sikhs’ sense of grievance and the repressiveness of the Congress-run Punjab Government, and arguing that it was necessary to give his life to save the country from &quot;dictatorial rule under the garb of democracy.&quot; Nehru did not intervene, and the fast commenced on 18 December 1960. Before entering his hut on the Golden Temple premises, he addressed a large gathering of Sikhs, instructing them to keep the movement peaceful, saying that damage to the country was damage to themselves. A roster of ten Sikhs was drafted to continue the movement in case Fateh Singh&#x27;s fast ended in death.

Indian leaders of diverse opinion attempted to intervene to persuade Fateh Singh to abandon the fast, though he would not withdraw from his resolution. As national concern grew over Fateh Singh&#x27;s life, as his possible death was feared to possibly lead to major Sikh estrangement from the government and further consequences, and more than 50,000 Sikhs had been jailed at this point, Nehru in a speech in Chandigarh on 20 December 1960 conceded that Punjabi was the dominant language of the Punjab and that it must be promoted in every way; this was repeated in a speech in Rajpura later in the day. On 23 December in a public address at Delhi, and again on 31 December, he made a personal appeal to Fateh Singh to stop the fast.

====Tara Singh&#x27;s release====
Chief Minister Partap Singh Kairon, under the advice of his old teacher and informal counsel Jodh Singh, set Tara Singh free on 4 January 1961, ostensibly to consult Fateh Singh, but in the hopes of reducing the chances of agreement between him and Nehru. Along with this strategic timing by Congress, a section of Sikhs pressured Tara Singh to have the fast ended, believing that he had incentive to delay any rapprochement, to bring about Fateh Singh&#x27;s death and consolidate his own leadership.

Similarly, some Sikh members of Congress were also under pressure; two Sikh MLAs resigned in solidarity with the fast, and former Defense Minister in the first Congress ministry, Baldev Singh, criticized the central government for backing out of their responsibility to implement the established compromise of the Regional Formula five years before, and that Tara Singh was being unfairly blamed now. Believing that the government was never sincere in implementing it then, at the state government&#x27;s renewed &quot;half-hearted&quot; attempts to implement it after 35,000-40,000 arrests at that point and in light of Fateh Singh&#x27;s potential death, he declared the Regional Formula &quot;dead&quot;, and that &quot;those very men who murdered the Regional Formula have now started shouting &quot;Long Live Regional Formula&quot;.

Tara Singh immediately called on Fateh Singh, severely weakened from his fast, then arranged to meet Nehru while he was in Bhavnagar, Gujarat for the annual Congress session. On a specially chartered flight from Delhi to Bhavnagar, he was accompanied by Harbans Singh Gujral, Lachhman Singh Gill, Hargurnad Singh, Harcharan Singh of Bathinda, and Seth Ram Nath, one Punjabi Hindu who openly espoused the cause for a Punjabi-speaking state. While in flight the group held mutual consultations and reduced their minimal demand in writing.

On 7 January 1961, Tara Singh held a two-hour meeting with Nehru, without result. While Nehru considered the Punjabi Suba as a communal demand in the garb of linguistic reorganization, Tara Singh countered that it was the opposition to the linguistic demand that was in fact being made on a communal basis.

The next day, Nehru added a postscript to what he had told Tara Singh, that the formation of forming linguistic states had not halted due to any discrimination against Punjab or distrust of the Sikhs, and that &quot;Punjab state is broadly speaking a Punjabi Suba with Punjabi as the dominant language,&quot; conveying consideration to making all of Punjab unilingual. He also expressed concern regarding Fateh Singh&#x27;s health and wished to see his fast ended. While there was no indication of any change in the government&#x27;s stance toward the Punjabi Suba, this reassured Tara Singh, who had a call made to Amritsar stating that the obligations of his vow had been fulfilled, and asking him to terminate his fast, a motion also adopted by the Working Committee of the Akali Dal, who on behalf of the Khalsa, told Fateh Singh that they were satisfied his pledge had been complied with and that he must end his fast.

====Conclusion====
Fateh Singh ended his 22-day fast with a glass of juice on 9 January 1961, marking the end of the seven-month-long &quot;morcha&quot;, or movement. According to official government figures, 30,000 Sikhs had been placed in jail over the course of the &quot;morcha&quot; which had taken place over the period of 1960–1961; they were released when Fateh Singh ended his fast.

Due to his role in having Fateh Singh&#x27;s fast ended without its objectives fulfilled, Tara Singh began to attract criticism among the masses and his leadership among them began to be questioned; during speeches over the next few days he was heckled and interrupted by congregations at Gurdwara Manji Sahib.

===Ascendance of Fateh Singh===
Political negotiations resumed between the Akalis and the government, with three meetings between Fateh Singh and Nehru on 8 February 1961, 1 March 1961, and 12 May 1961. While cordial, they did not yield solid results; Nehru offered to extend protection to the Punjabi language and look into Sikh grievances, but continued to oppose Punjabi-speaking areas forming a separate state, which was not accepted by Sikhs.

Nehru had invited Fateh Singh for the 8 February talks; the pending creation of Nagaland for &quot;the protection and preservation of Naga culture&quot; had given Sikhs new hope for the acceptance of the Punjabi Suba on similar grounds. Nehru reiterated his suspicion that a Sikh-majority state was the objective, and that Hindus being a minority there would engender harmful anti-Sikh sentiment in other states. Fateh Singh replied that it was Nehru&#x27;s responsibility to dispel, not encourage, those sentiments, to treat communities equally, and that as Sikhs were able to live safely in foreign countries, so they should be able to live in their own, demanding nothing but a unilingual state akin to others in the country. Nehru nevertheless continued to oppose the Punjabi Suba on religious demographic grounds in the following meetings. Gurbakhsh Singh, a deputy of Fateh Singh, stated that the maintenance of a Hindu majority could not be kept &quot;as a hanging sword over the Punjabi language.&quot;

The talks would end in failure; referring to Tara Singh, Nehru had said on 1 March, &quot;kya main taqat dushmanon ke haath men de dun?&quot; (&quot;How can I entrust power into the hands of the enemies?&quot;). Tara Singh in return wrote a letter of protest to Nehru, stating that if he was the root of Nehru&#x27;s suspicion and the main obstacle against the Punjabi Suba, he was willing to exile himself from public life and India itself if it meant the agreement to its formation.

====Tara Singh&#x27;s fast====
In addition to Nehru&#x27;s own view on the matter, political pressure on him and false propaganda from other communities began to depict Akalis as foreign agents, which the Akalis took offense at. To impress this point, Tara Singh himself embarked on a fast on 15 August 1961, during which notable Sikh mediators like Maharaja Yadavinder Singh of Patiala, and Hardit Singh Malik kept in touch with Nehru and Home Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri on one hand and Akali leaders on the other.

Rejecting Nehru&#x27;s 10 August appeal letter otherwise, Tara Singh&#x27;s fast, meant to draw national and international attention to the cause, again led to the Punjab Congress government&#x27;s suppression of pro-Akali newspapers (the Punjabi-language &quot;Jathedar&quot; and again &quot;Parbhat&quot;), the arrest of approximately 50 Akali leaders on 1 June, the withholding of funds to Khalsa College, Amritsar until its pro-Akali principal Dr. Harbans Singh was suspended in order to suppress student protests. Tara Singh has stated that the focus of the movement would shift from mass agitation to individual martyrdom; Harcharan Singh Hudiara declared that the deaths of Tara Singh and Fateh Singh would potentially prompt the Akali leadership to call for Punjab sovereignty.

Hardit Singh Malik had come to Amritsar as an emissary of Nehru, and Tara Singh ended his fast during his visit. Seeing this as a sign of an impending settlement between the Akalis and Congress, anti-Punjabi lobbies reacted strongly. Arya Samaj ideologue and news editor Lala Jagat Narain, who had resigned as minister in protest of the Regional Formula, warned on 6 October that &quot;the Hindus of Punjab would never accept the settlement.&quot;

====Tara Singh&#x27;s censure====
On 29 September, just before 30 September talks between Malik and Nehru implied compromise in the form of a commission, Nehru asked Tara Singh to end his fast, after the Akali Dal&#x27;s Working Committee approved the compromise. The commission was announced on 31 October after Tara Singh&#x27;s recovery and meeting with Nehru, though he and the Akali Dal would immediately take issue with the proposed appointees as neither being the ones proposed during the fast, nor politically neutral and unaligned with Nehru as promised. Malik would later disclose in a 26 August 1965 letter to the editor of the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; that Nehru had backed out of the agreement.

Having broken the fast without concrete progress on the issue after 48 days on 1 October 1961, criticism among Sikhs and damage to his reputation among them continued to grow, as the pledge solemnized at the Akal Takht was perceived to have been broken without achieving the stated target, and was thus seen as violating a religious vow. The responsibility for having Fateh Singh&#x27;s vow ended was also directed at Tara Singh.

A committee of five Sikh religious notables (&quot;Panj Pyare&quot; council), including religious scholars, jathedars of Kesgarh Sahib and the Akal Takht, and the head granthi of the Darbar Sahib, were selected and authorized on 24 November 1961 to investigate and determine the circumstances leading to the ending of the fast and determine penalties. Five days later, they pronounced Tara Singh guilty of breaking his word and blemishing the Sikh tradition of religious steadfastness and sacrifice, and he was ordered to perform additional prayers for a month and clean the shoes of the &quot;sangat&quot;, or congregation, and the dishes of the &quot;langar&quot;, or open community kitchen, for five days. Fateh Singh was also to recite extra prayers and wash &quot;langar&quot; dishes for five days for his own fast ending, though it was recognized that his fast had ended at Tara Singh&#x27;s request. Photographs of Tara Singh&#x27;s service were circulated widely in newspapers and served to somewhat rehabilitate his popular image and he was forgiven by the council of five, though his political reputation never fully recovered, and he had begun to be rejected by crowds at &quot;divans&quot; as far back as when after Fateh Singh&#x27;s fast had ended. As a result of developing differences over strategy and tactics among the Akali leadership, Fateh Singh would begin to eclipse him as the leader of the movement. By 1962, after a period of interparty schism, Fateh Singh would be elected president of the Akali Dal, and had the support of the majority faction, having formed a parallel Akali faction in 1963. Government media also presented Fateh Singh as the leader at the complete expense of Tara Singh, as a strategy to widen the divide.

Sikh votes, often divided among the Congress and Akali Dal, were consolidated for the Akalis in the 1962 elections; while Congress won with 90 out of 154 votes, Kairon only narrowly re-won his office, regarded by many as resulting from rigging. In the Punjabi-speaking region, over 70 percent of the over 2 million Sikh votes went for the Akalis, though while Tara Singh also won back his position on the SGPC, only 74 of the 160 voting members had voted, with the rest abstaining in protest due to the continued stigma of Tara Singh breaking his pledge, and he was condemned again in a July 1962 convention in Ludhiana; Fateh Singh would continue to lead the movement on a purely linguistic basis after Tara Singh was narrowly dislodged from his position in a no-confidence vote in October with 76 votes to 72, which created a brief rift among the Akalis when the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee broke with the SPGC in Amritsar in support of Tara Singh; another attempt by Tara Singh to dislodge Fateh Singh from the SGPC with a no-confidence vote in June 1963 failed.

Sant Fateh Singh&#x27;s style was seen as more tactful than Tara Singh&#x27;s, attracting back followers disillusioned with Tara Singh&#x27;s policies; in a letter to Nehru he maintained that &quot;We want a linguistic and only linguistic unit, where Punjabi language and culture are prevalent,&quot; regardless of religious demographics. He would hold a large rally to this end on 22 July 1962 at Mullanpur, and the political sidelining of Tara Singh amongst the Akalis would be assisted by Kairon, the Punjab Congress, and Communists, in a bid to take over the SGPC. Tara Singh and supporters including SGPC president Kirpal Singh Chak Sherwala and Akali Dal General Secretary Atma Singh would again be arrested on 17 August, with more arrest of supporters on 2 September.

===1962 Das Commission===
Meanwhile, following the pending settlement made up to that point, Nehru appointed a commission chaired by S. R. Das to address the question of Sikh grievances in December 1961. The Akali Dal did not agree with its composition or its scope, and did not present its case to it, though the commission carried on regardless, and rejected suggestions of anti-Sikh discrimination while denying the demand for a Punjabi-speaking state as a Sikh state.

It was boycotted by all Sikh organizations, except for a newly formed &quot;Nationalist Sikhs&quot; group, whose spokesman appeared at the behest of Kairon. Even he, however, would present instances of discrimination and those noted by others, including against the Punjabi language, the treatment of Sikh farmers in the Terai, and the lack of industrial development in Punjab. Characterizing the lack of a Punjabi Suba as discrimination against all Punjabis and not just Sikhs, he would assert that it was &quot;a travesty of facts to suggest that no cases of discrimination had been listed in this memorandum.&quot;

The few recommendations that were fielded by the Das commission included those by Arya Samaj editor Virendra, on behalf of the Hindi Raksha Samiti, who denied Punjabi as the mother tongue of the state&#x27;s Hindus, its separate status, and the legitimacy of Gurmukhi as anything more than a religious script, as well as that of Balraj Madhok of the Jan Sangh, who cited the Regional Formula and regional committees as the real sources of trouble to be scrapped, and also denied the legitimacy of Gurmukhi for Punjabi. Submitting its report in February 1962, which was accepted immediately by the central government in light of rapidly approaching elections, it relayed that the Regional Formula had been delayed but not blocked, and therefore no injustice had been done. It also deemed the Punjabi Suba as a continuation of Sikh demands for a state during Partition, and hence beyond the commission&#x27;s scope.

==Progress (1962-1965)==
===1962 wartime contributions===
With border tensions with China flaring up in 1962, the Akalis announced the suspension of further agitation in support of the war effort. The Punjabi contribution in soldiers and materiel matched that of the rest of India put together. 
In 1963, the Sikhs and the Punjab had contributed massive amounts of wealth to the war effort against China in 1962, with over 20 million rupees to the defense fund including 50,000 rupees directly from Fateh Singh to Nehru on 7 February, and gold double the weight of Nehru, encouraged by the Akalis who anti-Punjabi groups in Punjab had earlier attempted to portray as traitorous. The only region to give more in gold was Ganganagar district in Rajasthan, itself heavily populated with Sikh refugees from Partition.

Sikh soldiers took the brunt of Chinese reprisals, with Bhola Nath Mullik reporting, &quot;The Chinese perpetrated untold cruelties on the brave wounded Sikhs. Many of them were tied and then dragged and their brains were battered.&quot; Upon hearing such accounts, various concessions for Sikhs were offered from Chief Ministers across the country, including that of Madhya Pradesh announcing Punjabi in Gurmukhi script as a secondary school subject in his state while visiting Punjab, and large land grants for Punjabi soldiers from the CMs of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in their states following accounts from the North-East Frontier Agency and Ladakh.

On 24 December 1962, Sikh leaders met at Patiala, under the Maharaja of Patiala as the Chief Organizer, in order to continue national defense after the 1962 war, amidst a spate of anti-Sikh comments and incidents involving government officials through the following year.

Only following the change in Akali Dal leadership and the significant role of the Sikhs in the later Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, which generated strong support among the Sikh population, did the center begin to consider acceding to the long-standing Sikh demand.

====Punjab Raksha Dal====
During the 1962 war effort, Pratap Singh Kairon, who opposed the Punjabi Suba from the beginning, had undertaken efforts to raise a rural volunteer force called the Punjab Raksha Dal (&quot;Punjab Protection Army&quot;) for further reinforcement and manpower, and enlisted an American firm towards the construction of an air suspension factory in Punjab. Arya Samajists would nevertheless decry these efforts as a &quot;consolidation of Sikh strength&quot; and a steps towards a power seizure, and under such characterizations Kairon was told by the central government to merge the Punjab Raksha Dal with the Home Guard; factory plans were cancelled.

===Changes in leaderships (1964-1965)===
Amidst lingering suspicions among Congressites, Partap Singh Kairon&#x27;s administration had also been attracting corruption charges amidst ebbing support in 1963; he resigned on 14 June 1964, facing 33 charges compiled by Congress MLAs on 29 August 1963 and an enquiry on 22 October, with his detractors and opponents characterizing the American-educated Kairon&#x27;s political tactics, resulting in charges of corruption and nepotism, as the &quot;American technique.&quot; During his defense facing S. R. Das of the Das Commission, he reiterated his stance against the Punjabi Suba and on the national border. The leakage of Das&#x27; report would nevertheless prompt his preemptive resignation a week before its official release.

His legacy would include the founding of Punjabi University, helping Punjab&#x27;s agricultural peasantry with farming loans and techniques, electric power, infrastructure to attempt to draw the Jatts and other agriculturalists away from the Akalis, and the beginnings of Punjab&#x27;s Green Revolution, which would go on to have strong influence on Punjab&#x27;s political course in the coming decades, though Akali disagreement with Congress also alienated Sikh peasantry from Congress.

Jawaharlal Nehru would die shortly before on 27 May 1964, also remaining an opponent of the Punjabi Suba.

In January 1965, a close associate of Fateh Singh, Sant Channan Singh, was elected SGPC president, further consolidating Fateh Singh&#x27;s position when his faction defeated Tara Singh&#x27;s with ninety seats to 45 in the SGPC on 18 January. With the parallel factions remaining divided, Tara Singh withdrawing from the scene for six months for contemplation amid dwindling political fortunes, though his supporters remained active. Tara Singh would retire to Salogra, a small village in Himachal Pradesh, to enable Fateh Singh to lead the movement freely.

===1965 Nalwa Conference===
A subsequent spate of desecrations of Sikh scriptures in the following period led to another Sikh convention in Patiala on 29 April 1965. The &quot;Sikh Review Calcutta&quot; noted these and past incidents of forced shavings and police assaults on Sikhs, ongoing Arya Samaj newspaper attacks on Sikh gurus, and vandalisms and burnings of various gurdwaras, all without redress from state or central governments. Internationally, a Malaysian Sikh convention at Punjabi School Kuala Lumpur also noted the continued desecrations as &quot;a result of pre-meditated conspiracy by the people who are out to injure the religious susceptibilities of the Sikhs in order to create disorder in the country by such provocations.&quot;

Following a conference in Ludhiana beginning in May 1965, attention to the Punjabi Suba, the shared objective of both factions of the Akali Dal, was renewed on 4 July. Named the Nalwa Conference after famed Sikh general Hari Singh Nalwa of the Sikh Empire, the main Conference resolution was drawn up by eminent Sikh scholar and intellectual Kapur Singh, and moved by Gurnam Singh, then leader of the opposition in the Punjab Legislative Assembly, and seconded by Giani Bhupinder Singh, then president of Tara Singh&#x27;s faction of the Akali Dal. The resolution read as follows:
A similar statement of support was issued by the Chief Khalsa Diwan. While the demand of the Nalwa Conference had been for a self-determined status within the Union, the Hindi and Urdu presses interpreted this as a call for a sovereign Sikh state.

Later in an agreement in October 1968, a resolution which would reflect the ideas of Kapur Singh, who would become the senior vice president of the Akali Dal in 1969, would state that the Khalsa was &quot;a sovereign people by birthright,&quot; the command of Guru Gobind Singh, and by the course of Sikh history, advocating for autonomous status in a demarcated territory within India, and that the national Constitution &quot;should be on a correct federal basis and that the states should have greater autonomy,&quot; referring to the powers of all states of the country. This had been &quot;the Congress party in power has abused the Constitution to the detriment of the non-Congress Governments, and uses its power for its party interest.&quot;

===Tara Singh&#x27;s return===
On 24 July 1965, Tara Singh ended his self-exile from politics. On 2 August, he addressed a press conference in Delhi, applauded and pledged support for the Nalwa Conference resolution, calling for the Sikhs&#x27; &quot;place in the sun of free India&quot; in a statement. He further stated that:

* promises regarding self-determined Sikh political status were cynically repudiated soon after Independence, 
* A &quot;resurgence of militant Hinduism [had] since 1947 completely taken control of the scene in free India,&quot; characterized by &quot;an emphasis on ramming Sanskritised Hindi down the unwilling throats of non-Hindi speaking people, insistence on the performance of Hindu rituals at State functions&quot; to the complete exclusion of minority ceremonies, towards whom &quot;an aggressive attitude&quot; was directed, including various anti-Muslim riots and &quot;persistent and planned desecration of Sikh places of worship&quot; by &quot;communalist thugs&quot;, &quot;discontent in the Hill areas of Assam and Nagaland&quot; due to &quot;unfair treatment of Christians&quot;, and the continuous stifling of Kashmiri aspirations, with their leaders placed under detention, &quot;all while proselytising activities of the Hindus have been encouraged by the State&quot;, and that it was &quot;clear that the minorities in India, in particular the Muslims, the Christians and the Sikhs, stand in great jeopardy&quot;; and 
* that &quot;the Sikh people are makers of history, and the community&#x27;s identity cannot be wiped out in the name of national unity&quot; by &quot;these new rulers of India&quot; seeking to destroy or absorb it.

In response, the government would again try to boost Fateh Singh&#x27;s profile in relation to Tara Singh&#x27;s, following reaction and criticism to his statement among some Hindus characterizing it as treasonous. The new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri invited Fateh Singh to talks on 7 August, though Fateh Singh would also reiterate the demand for a Punjabi Suba in the wake of continued government indifference to desecrations of Sikh scriptures and disregard of Akali and Sikh contributions to national defense. On 14 August, his Akali faction&#x27;s Working Committee passed a resolution stating that &quot;the Government of India did not trust the Punjabis in general and the Sikhs in particular.&quot;

In a 10 August address speech, Fateh Singh eulogized Inderjit Singh, the Bathinda Special Jail deaths, and the scores of martyrs for the cause. He announced on 16 August that in order to secure the Punjabi Suba he would commence another fast on 10 September, and if it was unsuccessful, on the 25th he would self-immolate at the Akal Takht.

SGPC president Channan Singh, Gurcharan Singh Tohra, and Akali Dal vice president Harcharan Singh Hudiara went to Delhi on 8 September to attend a high-level meeting with prominent government leaders, including the Maharaja of Patiala Yadavinder Singh, the Defense Minister, The Minister of State for Home Affairs, and members of Parliament.

===1965 war===
Requesting Fateh Singh to defer the fast in light of the declaration of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965; some, including Yadavinder Singh, gave their assurance of support for the Punjabi Suba cause if the government continued to avoid the demand after normalcy was restored. This message was relayed to Fateh Singh on 9 September as Channan Singh and the Akali leaders returned to Amritsar. Fateh Singh accepted the request and appealed to the Sikhs in Punjab to support the war effort and the senior commanders, who were almost all Sikh. Pakistani radio would offer support to Fateh Singh and the Sikh soldiery and peasantry if Sikh nationhood was opted for, deploying paratroopers to aid expected widespread revolt, which never materialized and was strongly rejected. Tara Singh stated, &quot;We shall, of course, struggle and gain our freedom by our sacrifices and by the grace of our Great Guru, but shall never ask for support from Pakistan. Such a suicidal step can only help us in jumping from frying pan into fire,&quot; and Fateh Singh offered blood, &quot;as much as can be taken leaving a bare minimum for me to exist or for self immolation for the Punjabi Suba.&quot; The SGPC directed all 700 gurdwaras under its control to provide all aid to soldiers and their families.

The war ended 21 days later with a ceasefire on 22 September, with both sides claiming victory. More demonstrations of patriotism prompted the Indian government, who after Nehru&#x27;s death in 1964 had leadership that was more open to consider regional demands, to revisit the Punjabi Suba issue in light of the contributions in the war effort by Sikhs, who had previously been seen with mistrust and apprehension by the government. Stories of the bravery and patriotism of the Sikhs during the war had already been circulating, and on 6 September the Union Home Minister, Gulzarilal Nanda, had made a statement in the Lok Sabha that &quot;the whole question of formation of Punjabi-speaking state could be examined afresh with an open mind.&quot; Later on the 23rd he declared the formation of a committee of the Cabinet to pursue the matter further, with the stated hope that &quot;the efforts of this Cabinet Committee and of the Parliamentary Committee will lead to a satisfactory settlement of the question.&quot; The Punjab Congress Committee also debated the issue at length, with Zail Singh, General Mohan Singh, and Narain Singh Shahbazpuri lending their full support.

==Formation (1966)==
In the Parliament, the Home Minister sent a list of nominees from the Rajya Sabha to the chairman and a list of nominees from the Lok Sabha to the Speaker, Sardar Hukam Singh, who announced the final 22-person committee representing all sections of the House, including representatives from the Akali Dal, Congress, Jana Sangh, Swatantra Party, Communists, and independents.

===Parliamentary Consultative Committee===
The period for receiving memoranda from the various parties and individuals was set from October to 5 November 1965. Preliminary discussions were held from 26 November to 25 December 1965. On 10 January 1966, the SGPC&#x27;s general secretary Lachhman Singh Gill and executive member Rawel Singh met the committee and presented the case for a Punjabi-speaking state. On the 27th, Giani Kartar Singh and Harcharan Singh Brar appeared in the Punjab legislature on behalf of Congress, also arguing in favor of it. Of the memoranda submitted to the committee, nearly 2,200 supported the Punjabi Suba and 903 opposing. Hukam Singh was thus able to secure string support from the assembled committee for its creation. Morarji Desai, Ram Subhag Singh and Biju Patnaik were among those who voted against the resolution.

Amidst perceived attempts by Nanda and Indira Gandhi to limit the Committee&#x27;s purview, the Sikh Review Calcutta reiterated the constitutional and linguistic grounds for the Punjabi Suba; a memorandum submitted by Buta Singh on 5 November blamed &quot;Hindu communalists and their hirelings&quot; for creating the problem by renouncing Punjabi for Hindi, and Tara Singh reiterated the Sikh right to &quot;demand a self-determined political status for themselves within the Republic of the Union of India such as might enable them to preserve themselves and prosper freely.&quot;

The Parliamentary Committee&#x27;s report was handed in on 15 March 1966; the Congress Working Committee had already adopted a motion on the 6th recommending the government to carve out a Punjabi-speaking state out of the erstwhile East Punjab state. The report was made public on 18 March, and the demand was conceded on 23 April, with a commission appointed on 17 April to demarcate the new states of Punjab and Haryana, and transferring certain areas to Himachal Pradesh. The Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 was passed on 18 September in the Lok Sabha, and on 1 November 1966, a Punjabi-speaking state became a reality.

In total, 57,129 Sikhs would be placed in jail over the course of the movement.

====Jan Sangh immolations====
In reaction to the committee&#x27;s recommendation to the central government of a state with Punjabi as its official language on 9 March 1966, the Jan Sangh had started an agitation. There were strikes, arson and murders, including 3 Congressmen burnt alive in Panipat, including an old associate of Bhagat Singh, after which it was withdrawn on 18 March. Drawing widespread condemnation, and with 200 casualties, the agitation failed to receive popular support.

==Implementation==
The Akali Dal took issue with the conceived form of the state of Punjab as presented, the form in which it continues to exist currently. Akali Dal opposed the implementation of the Punjab Reorganisation Act on 1 November 1966 and Akali leaders protested against it. Several months before its inauguration, Fateh Singh expressed his dissatisfaction over several issues of contention, including genuinely Punjabi-speaking areas being left out of the new state and given to Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, namely adjoining areas of Ambala, Kalka, Pinjore, Chandigarh, Karnal, Una, Dalhousie, and parts of Ganganagar district, as well as Sirsa, parts of Nalagarh, Tohana and Guhla, Ratia block in Hissar, and Shahbad block in Kurukshetra. (as a result of the falsified linguistic returns of the 1961 census), Chandigarh was being turned into a Union Territory, the level of autonomy of the states, and power and irrigation projects were to be taken over by the central government, instead of the state retaining control of them.

Over the use of the 1961 census, Tara Singh boycotted the commission, Fateh Singh Akali faction passed a resolution stating that they had been done on religious and not linguistic lines, and the Chief Khalsa Diwan issued a press note:
===Chandigarh===
The trifurcation was to done by &quot;tehsil&quot;, rather than village, and would further skew the process. Two Commission members had proposed the exclusion of Kharar &quot;tehsil&quot; from Punjab, which, while unimplemented, had been the first sign that the adjacent Chandigarh was potentially not to go to Punjab state. The third member of the commission, Subimal Dutt, in his dissent noted that Kharar&#x27;s rural population was majority Punjabi speaking, and that &quot;the Hindu population in Chandigarh Capital project is purely migratory, having come from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan for labour only. Therefore, Kharar tehsil and Chandigarh cannot be considered to be Hindi-speaking.&quot;

Chandigarh had been the planned capital of Punjab, built to replace Lahore, the capital of erstwhile Punjab and of the Sikh Empire, which became part of Pakistan during the partition, Chandigarh was claimed by both Haryana and Punjab. Pending resolution of the dispute, it was declared as a separate Union Territory which would serve as the capital of both the states, while Haryana would ostensibly set up its own capital city.

Though the Union Government had decided to give Chandigarh to Punjab as solely its capital in 1970, per a formal communication issued by the Union government on 29 January 1970, and Haryana was granted five years and a proposed budget of 200 million rupees to set up its own capital, this has not been implemented, though Chandigarh had been conceived to be the capital of a single state. However, the 1970 decision to be implemented in 1975 was made contingent on the transfer of territory in Fazilka to Haryana, to be made accessible through a corridor, and the process again stalled.

The provision that Chandigarh&#x27;s civil employees would be drawn in a proportion of 60:40 from Punjab and Haryana respectively has gone unheeded, with the proportion of employees drawn from Punjab having plummeted. The city has instead created its own body of civil employees drawn from outside the state. The Punjabi language has no official status in the city despite its creation in Puadhi Punjabi-speaking territory and its dominant Punjabi presence. As it remains a Union territory, the central government remains in control of its entire executive process.

===Black Day===

A week after the implementation, Fateh Singh called for the continuation of the agitation, in order to have Chandigarh and adjoining Punjabi-speaking areas left in Haryana, as well as the control of the Bhakra Nangal Dam and other hydropower projects and headworks, returned to Punjab. Commencing on 16 November 1966, he began to send jathas of Akali leaders to the Punjabi countryside to rally support. 12 December was observed as a &quot;Black Day.&quot; The next day, Fateh Singh started his fast at the Akal Takht, announced that he would commit self-immolation on 27 December. The Union government was concerned at this announcement and continued negotiations on the demands. An hour before the scheduled time of 4 pm on 27 December for immolation, after Hukam Singh arrived in Amritsar and told a large congregation at the Golden Temple that Indira Gandhi, who had assumed power on 20 January 1966, had agreed to arbitrate on the outstanding issues and that Chandigarh belonged to Punjab, Fateh Singh called off his immolation bid under this understanding, though she would state on 8 January 1967 that no assurances had been made on Chandigarh, and talks were unsuccessful. He would fast again before the 1970 decision. He would continue to demand the inclusion of Chandigarh and other Punjabi-speaking areas left out of Punjab until his death in 1972.

===Darshan Singh Pheruman===
The demand was additionally advanced by &quot;jathedar&quot; Darshan Singh Pheruman, a veteran Akali leader with a long history of participating in Sikh political rights movements, from the Akali movement during which he was jailed for a year in 1921 and the Jaito Morcha of 1923–25 to reinstate Sikh leaders of Punjabi princely states removed by the British in which he was jailed again three years later. He went to the jail three times during the course of the Punjabi Suba movement. Believing that Sant Fateh Singh had reneged on his (&quot;ardas&quot;) before completing his objective of the return of Chandigarh and Punjabi-speaking areas by not following through on his vow of self-immolation, on 1 August, Pheruman announced his own fast to begin on 15 August 1969.

Declaring the country as free but the &quot;panth&quot; still in bondage without a Sikh homeland, the party&#x27;s Working Committee resolved to continue to struggle for the objectives of Fateh Singh&#x27;s fast, with nearly all Punjabi parties participating in a huge procession in Chandigarh to have it included. Pheruman was arrested and sent to jail, where he continued his fast-unto-death. He died on 27 October 1969, on the 74th day of his hunger strike.

===Unresolved issues===
Despite the success of the movement in the creation of the state of Punjab, its implementation failed to satisfy its leaders as it left many unresolved issues behind, including the allocation of the capital city of Chandigarh, which is the only state capital in the country to be shared with another state, adjustment of some of the territorial claims of Punjab, with many large Punjabi-speaking areas left out of the allocated state, and the distribution of river waters which remains unresolved. The national government&#x27;s centralizing impulses, as manifest in issues like wheat procurement, water resources, and power resources, generated further Sikh disaffection, strengthening the belief that New Delhi was trying to impose a &quot;political brake&quot; on the community&#x27;s economic and social advancement. This unresolved tension would lead to campaigns for more state autonomy throughout the 1970s. To this end, the Akali Dal would draft the Anandpur Sahib Resolution in the 1970s, and re-launch the movement in the form of the Dharam Yudh Morcha in 1982; by 1983 more than 40,000 Akali protestors had courted arrest, with thousands remaining in jail for months, and some for years. The Khalistan movement, which gained traction in the subsequent decades, would also stress the right of control over territory and water. These issues continue to figure prominently in Punjab politics and remain points of contention between the state and the central government.

<text>The Symphony No. 8 in G major, Op. 88, B. 163, is a symphony by Antonín Dvořák, composed in 1889 at Vysoká u Příbramě, Bohemia, on the occasion of his election to the Bohemian Academy of Science, Literature and Arts. Dvořák conducted the premiere in Prague on 2 February 1890. In contrast to other symphonies of both the composer and the period, the music is cheerful and optimistic. It was originally published as Symphony No. 4.

== History ==

Dvořák composed and orchestrated the symphony within the two-and-a-half-month period from 26 August to 8 November 1889 at his summer resort in Vysoká u Příbramě, Bohemia. The score was composed on the occasion of his admission to Prague Academy and dedicated &quot;To the Bohemian Academy of Emperor Franz Joseph for the Encouragement of Arts and Literature, in thanks for my election.&quot; Dvořák conducted the premiere in Prague on 2 February 1890.

Dvořák tried to achieve a marked difference to his Symphony No. 7, a stormy romantic work. No. 8 would be: &quot;different from the other symphonies, with individual thoughts worked out in a new way&quot;. The Eighth is cheery and lyrical and draws its inspiration more from the Bohemian folk music that Dvořák loved.

== Structure and scoring ==
Dvořák kept the typical format of a symphony in four movements, but structured them in an unusual way. All movements show a remarkable variety of themes, many of them based on Bohemian material. Occasionally the development of the themes seems like improvisation.

The work is scored for two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes (1st doubling cor anglais), two clarinets (in A and B), two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings.

The orchestration of piccolo and cor anglais is unusual in this symphony. The piccolo only sustains a long note in unison with the flute at the exposition of the first movement and the cor anglais only plays a short but exposed phrase during the second recapitulation of the main &quot;bird call&quot; theme, also in the first movement. In some editions, the second oboe doubles on cor anglais rather than the 1st oboe as indicated in most scores.

A typical performance of the symphony lasts about 36 minutes, making it one of Dvořák&#x27;s shorter symphonies.

&lt;/score&gt;

The first movement is a powerful and glowing exposition characterized by liberal use of timpani. It opens with a lyrical G minor theme in the cellos, horns, clarinets and first bassoon with trombones playing &quot;pianissimo&quot; accompaniment, and violas and double basses pizzicato. This gives way to a &quot;bird call&quot; flute melody, reaching the symphony&#x27;s key of G major. Writing about a performance by the National Symphony Orchestra, Peter Laki notes that the development section &quot;works up quite a storm.&quot; In the recapitulation, the second main theme is played by the English horn, two octaves lower than in the exposition. The movement ends with a &quot;short but very energetic coda&quot;.

=== Second movement ===

&lt;/score&gt;

Despite being marked Adagio, the second movement moves along at quite a reasonable speed. It begins with the strings playing the main theme of the movement and ending very softly, following with a similar motion in the oboes and flutes; the clarinets answer, and this conversation continues, including a strong interjection by the strings. The dialogue between the woodwinds dies down and leads into theme being stated by the first flute and oboe, over light clarinets, bassoons, and first horn, descending C major scales in the violins, pizzicato violas and cellos, and gentle quavers in the basses. A similar statement of the theme is echoed by a violin solo, which ends in cheerful and satisfying double stops. The orchestra then plays a variant of the theme boldly. Much of the movement is development of this same theme. Similar to Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral&quot; Symphony, the music is inspired by the tranquil landscapes, depicting a summer&#x27;s day, interrupted by a thunderstorm.

=== Third movement ===
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative{
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = &quot;cello&quot;
 \key bes \major
 \time 3/8
 \tempo \markup &quot;III. Scherzo&quot;

&lt;/score&gt;

Most of the third movement is a melancholy waltz in time. Near the end, the meter changes to , and the music ends in a manner not unlike that of the second movement. The first notes of the Trio section (G major) are used in the Coda in . The movement is not the typical minuet or scherzo, but an &quot;intermezzo&quot; akin to the third movements of the First and Second Symphony by Brahms. In contrast to the &quot;sweet and languid waltz&quot; of the first theme, the second, &quot;functioning as a &#x27;trio,&#x27; sounds more like a Bohemian folk dance&quot;.

=== Fourth movement ===

&lt;/score&gt;

The finale, formally a &quot;complex theme-and-variations&quot;, is the most turbulent movement. It begins with a fanfare of trumpets. Conductor Rafael Kubelik said in a rehearsal: &quot;Gentlemen, in Bohemia the trumpets never call to battle – they always call to the dance!&quot; The music progresses to a beautiful melody which is first played by the cellos. The tension is masterfully built and finally released at approximately two minutes into the piece, with a cascade of instruments triumphantly playing the initial theme at a somewhat faster pace. A central contrasting episode is derived from the main theme. From there the movement compellingly progresses through a tempestuous middle section, modulating from major to minor several times throughout. After a return to the slow, lyrical section, the piece ends on a chromatic coda, in which brass and timpani are greatly prominent. Laki summarises: &quot;Dvorák&#x27;s handling of form is indebted to Beethoven and Brahms, but he filled out the form with melodies of an unmistakably Czech flavor and a joviality few composers at the time possessed. The variations vary widely in character: some are slower and some are faster in tempo, some are soft (such as the virtuosic one for solo flute), and some are noisy; most are in the major mode, though the central one, reminiscent of a village band, is in the minor. The music is always cheerful and optimistic.&quot;

== Performances and publication ==

The composer conducted the orchestra of the National Theater in Prague in the first performance on 2 February 1890, as part of the concert &quot;13. Populäres Konzert der Künstlerressource&quot; (13th popular concert of the artists&#x27; resource). After the successful premiere, he conducted the work again on 7 November 1890 in a &quot;Museumskonzert&quot; in Frankfurt and the following year in Cambridge, on the night before his being awarded an honorary doctorate. The symphony was performed several times by the Royal Philharmonic Society during his sixth trip to the United Kingdom.

Hans Richter conducted the first performances in Vienna and London. He wrote after the concert in Vienna to the composer: &quot;An dieser Aufführung hätten Sie gewiß Freude gehabt. Wir alle haben gefühlt, daß es sich um ein herrliches Werk handelt: darum waren wir alle auch mit Enthusiasmus dabei. […] Der Beifall war warm und herzlich.&quot; (You would have enjoyed this performance very much. We all felt that it is a great work, therefore we all were enthusiastic. […] The applause was warm and cordial.)

Dvořák had the London firm of Vincent Novello publish the symphony in 1890, because he had disagreements with his regular publisher Fritz Simrock, who was more interested in shorter works as moneymakers. Simrock wanted to publish the movement titles and the composer&#x27;s name in German, which Dvořák refused as a &quot;proud Bohemian&quot;. Because of the country of its first publication, this symphony has occasionally been known as the &quot;English&quot; symphony, though &quot;it would be more correct to call it the &#x27;Czech&#x27;, at least in comparison with its predecessor in D minor which was modelled more on Brahms.&quot;

<text>Albert Hay Malotte (May 19, 1895 – November 16, 1964) was an American pianist, organist, composer and educator, best known for his musical setting of &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;.

==Biography and career==
Malotte was the son of Charles and Katherine (Donavon) Malotte. He was in Boy Scouts of America Troop 1, the first Boy Scout troop in Philadelphia. Malotte graduated from Tioga High School and sang at Saint James Episcopal Church in Philadelphia as a choir boy. He studied with Victor Herbert, W. S. Stansfield, and later in Paris with organist Georges Jacob. His career as an organist began in Chicago where he played for silent pictures, and he later concertized throughout the US and Europe.

During World War II he held the rank of captain in the Special Services for two years while he toured with the USO and entertained troops in New Guinea, Australia and Europe. At one point he sponsored his own troupe of entertainers that included Judith Anderson, Anne Triola and Helen McClure Preister. Malotte was an amateur pilot, avid golfer and even boxed with Jack Dempsey in Memphis, Tennessee. He spent most of his career as a composer in Hollywood.

Malotte married Marguerite Stevens Hester on August 23, 1946. His first wife, Elmina Todd, had died the previous year in Hollywood.

Malotte composed a number of film scores, including mostly uncredited music for animations from the Disney studios. Although two movies for which he composed scores won best Short Subject Academy Awards (&quot;Ferdinand the Bull&quot; in 1939 and &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; in 1940), he is best remembered for a setting of &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. Written in 1935, it was first recorded by baritone John Charles Thomas, and has remained popular in churches, concerts and recordings. Malotte composed a number of other religious pieces, including settings of the Beatitudes and of the Twenty-third Psalm which have also remained popular as solos. His secular songs, such as &quot;Ferdinand the Bull&quot; (from the Disney animated short of the same name), &quot;For my mother&quot; (a setting of a poem by 12-year-old Bobby Sutherland) and &quot;I am proud to be an American&quot; are less well remembered. Some of his works are collected in the library of the University of California Los Angeles and the Library of Congress.

In addition, Malotte wrote uncredited stock music for many other films in the 1930s and early 1940s, including twenty-two of Disney&#x27;s Silly Symphonies and other shorts, among them &quot;Little Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Ferdinand the Bull&quot;. He also composed cantatas, oratorios, musicals and ballets. Malotte owned Apple Valley Music.

One of his most odd compositions is &quot;Fiesta en Purchena&quot;, a piece for piano composed in 1938 and published by G. Schirmer. Malotte wrote in the first page of the score why he composed this piece based on a historical event called Moorish Games (in Spanish: Juegos Moriscos) which happened in 1569 in Purchena, a small Spanish town to which he had never gone. This is the explanation:

FIESTA EN PURCHENA was suggested to me by the following quotation from Eleanor Hague&#x27;s very interesting book &quot;Music in Ancient Arabia and Spain&quot;. In a chapter dealing with Moorish festivals, she relates that &quot;The Moors who most vitally maintained their tradition were those of the kingdom of Granada, the last stronghold of Islamism in the peninsula.&quot; The most vivid pictures of the music festivals celebrated in the kingdom are to be found in the works of Ginés Pérez de Hita. As an example I give the following, which shows the subtlety, orderliness, and elegance of their artistic contests: &quot;The plaza of Purchena was ready for the dances, with many carpets spread; all the important people were seated round about with Ibn Humeya on a dais, and lute and timbrel in place. Many Moorish youths, beautifully dressed, danced, one by one, marvelously well. Thereafter followed various cavaliers, dancing with lovely Moorish ladies.&quot;

There are no biographies or studies of Malotte&#x27;s life and compositions in English, but there is a short one in Spanish published by Purchena&#x27;s Town Council in 2013, with the institutional support of the United States Embassy in Spain, written by the musician Bartolomé Llorens Peset. This book, called &quot;Fiesta en Purchena: Los Juegos Moriscos de Aben Humeya en la obra del compositor estadounidense Albert Hay Malotte&quot;, also encloses a recording of &quot;Fiesta in Purchena&quot; performed by Tomeu Moll, a pianist from Valencia.

Malotte died of pneumonia in 1964 and is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.

<doc id="815538" wikidata="Q7743326" url="?curid=815538" title="The Jocks and the Geordies">
<text>The Jocks and the Geordies was a British comic strip which appeared in the magazine &quot;The Dandy&quot; and was drawn by Jimmy Hughes. It ran from 1975 to 1990, when artist Jimmy Hughes retired, with occasional appearances after that date.

==Concept==
The strip was about two groups of five schoolboys living in the village of Crosspatch, crossing the border of Scotland and England. As a result, they were in constant battles with one another, with each in turn getting their comeuppance for pranks which were often quite violent. Often both sets of boys would be in trouble from their teachers (Mr McAllistair and Mr Bigglesthwaite) at the end, both of whom despaired of the rivalry and would frequently administer the cane (the belt in the case of the Jocks). The Geordies generally got the upper hand as they tended to use cunning, whereas the Jocks relied entirely upon brute force.

The Jocks (Scottish boys) wore various tartan jumpers and tam o&#x27;shanter caps, which were so absurdly large that their wearers&#x27; eyes were rarely visible. Their names were Big Jock (the leader), Wee Eck, Hector, Angus and Sandy. The Geordies (North East England boys) wore tiny caps and almost identical dark school uniforms; some of their socks were ridiculously tight, making their shins look pencil thin. The names of the Geordies were not always consistent: the fifth Geordie was referred to as &#x27;Sidney&#x27; in the 1979 &quot;Dandy&quot; annual but this name was later given to the leader of the Geordies. The second and fourth Geordies have been referred to as Specky and Lofty respectively, but these names were not used regularly. In the late 1980s, the names of each character appeared under a &#x27;mugshot&#x27; and they were Sidney, Percy, Arnold, Cedric and Egbert.

<doc id="815557" wikidata="Q321441" url="?curid=815557" title="Roger Smith (executive)">
<text>Roger Bonham Smith (July 12, 1925 – November 29, 2007) was the chairman and CEO of General Motors Corporation from 1981 to 1990, and is widely known as the main subject of Michael Moore&#x27;s 1989 documentary film &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;.

Smith seemed to be the last of the old-line GM chairmen, a conservative anonymous bureaucrat, resisting change. However, propelled by industry and market conditions, Smith oversaw some of the most fundamental changes in GM&#x27;s history. When Smith took over GM, it was reeling from its first annual loss since the early 1920s. Its reputation had been tarnished by lawsuits, persistent quality problems, bad labor relations, public protests over the installation of Chevrolet engines in Oldsmobiles, and by a poorly designed diesel engine. GM was also losing market share to foreign automakers for the first time.

Deciding that GM needed to completely change its structure in order to be competitive, Smith instituted a sweeping transformation. Initiatives included divisional consolidation, forming strategic joint ventures with Japanese and Korean automakers, launching the Saturn division, investing heavily in technological automation and robotics, and attempting to rid the company of its risk-averse bureaucracy. However, Smith&#x27;s far-reaching goals proved too ambitious to be implemented effectively in the face of the company&#x27;s resistant corporate culture. Despite Smith&#x27;s vision, he was unable to successfully integrate GM&#x27;s major acquisitions and failed to tackle the root causes of GM&#x27;s fundamental problems.

A controversial figure widely associated with GM&#x27;s decline, Smith&#x27;s tenure is commonly viewed as a failure, as GM&#x27;s share of the U.S. market fell from 46% to 35% and the company lapsed close to bankruptcy during the early 1990s recession. Smith and his legacy remain subjects of considerable interest and debate among automotive writers and historians.

==Career==

===Beginnings with General Motors===
Smith spent virtually his entire professional career working for General Motors. He was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Besse Belle (Obetz) and E. Quimby Smith. Smith earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration at the University of Michigan in 1947, and his MBA at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Ross School of Business in 1953. He served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946.

Smith began his career at GM in 1949 as an accounting clerk, and had become the company&#x27;s treasurer by 1970, and vice president the following year. In 1974, Smith was elected executive vice president in charge of the financial, public relations, and government relations staffs. He ascended to GM&#x27;s chairmanship in 1981.

====Poletown plant controversy====
In 1981, mayor Coleman Young and the city of Detroit won a notorious landmark decision in the Michigan Supreme Court, &quot;Poletown Neighborhood Council v. City of Detroit&quot; that allowed the city to use its eminent domain power to raze an existing immigrant neighborhood in neighboring Hamtramck. In order to transfer the land to GM for the construction of a new factory, the city condemned the homes of 4,200 residents as well as numerous churches, schools, and businesses, including the original Dodge assembly plant opened in 1914 by John and Horace Dodge for their then new 1915 Dodge Brothers car (&quot;Dodge Main&quot;).

Although the deal predated Smith&#x27;s tenure as chairman, he subsequently used the construction of the new Poletown factory, along with plants on a greenfield site in Lake Orion Michigan, and one in Wentzville, Missouri (an identical twin to Orion) to showcase the technology he felt would lead GM into a new era. Unfortunately, the factories failed to live up to their promise and since they were duplicates of existing GM factories, unable to flexibly produce different models, were ultimately panned by critics as obsolete on the day they opened.

===Reorganizing General Motors===
Smith began the reorganization of GM that would define his chairmanship (see below), with the 1981 creation of the worldwide Truck and Bus Group, consolidating the design, manufacture, sales and service of all trucks, buses and vans under one umbrella. 1982 saw the creation of the Truck and Bus Manufacturing Division, which combined all truck manufacturing and assembly operations from their former divisions, but still a separate bureaucracy from that of the Truck and Bus Group.

In 1982 Smith negotiated contract concessions with the United Auto Workers and cut planned raises for white-collar workers. After unveiling a more generous bonus program for top executives that provoked an angry response from the union, Smith was forced to back-pedal. Relations with the UAW, management, and stockholders remained strained. Profits improved in 1983 and Smith began unveiling his vision for reorganization, diversification, and &quot;deindustrialization.&quot;

One of the most controversial decisions made during Smith&#x27;s tenure was the partial elimination of divisional autonomy in 1984. In the 1920s, chairman and CEO Alfred Sloan, Jr. had established semi-autonomous divisions within the corporation, each designing and marketing their own vehicles (Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac). This was considered a crucial factor propelling GM past market leader Ford in the 1930s. By the 1980s however, that autonomy (also including Fisher Body division producing the car bodies, and GM Assembly division building them) were seen as representing a dated business model that had led to needless large scale redundancy, infighting by the divisions, and a bloated internal bureaucracy.

====1984 reorganization====
Smith took on the massive GM bureaucracy with disastrous results. A sea change in how GM would market and build cars in the future, the 1984 reorganization was intended to streamline the process and create greater efficiencies; the reverse actually occurred. Combining the nameplate divisions, Fisher Body, and GM Assembly into two groups, C-P-C (Chevrolet, Pontiac, Canada) to build small cars and B-O-C (Buick, Oldsmobile, Cadillac) to build large cars, the effort was subsequently criticized for creating chaos within the company. Longstanding informal relationships which had greased the wheels of GM were severed, seemingly overnight, leading to confusion and slipping new product programs. The reorganization virtually stopped GM in its tracks for 18 months, and never really worked as intended, with the CPC division building Cadillacs and BOC building Pontiacs. The reorganization added costs and created more layers of bureaucracy when the new groups added management, marketing and engineering staff, duplicating existing staff at both the corporate and division levels. Almost ten years elapsed before the 1984 reorganization was unwound and all car groups were combined into one division. 

By the 1990s, GM&#x27;s program of sharing components across divisions that began in the 70s as a way to cut costs grew into a marketing problem. After the 1984 reorganization forced teamwork by the divisions, parts sharing evolved into wholesale sharing of entire designs and simply re-badging vehicles for each division. Observers suggested differences between automobiles produced and marketed by the Chevy, Buick, and Oldsmobile divisions were less distinct as a consequence. Automotive commentators cited a lack of a distinct brand identity and demographic changes as crucial factors in the demise of the Oldsmobile division in 2004. Compounding GM&#x27;s problems was the fact while entire platforms shared designs, the engineered parts beneath the surface, where customers did not care or did not notice were often not shared, which is where money could be saved. Analyst David Cole summed it up: &quot;The engineering was 180 degrees out of phase. GM cars looked alike outside but were all different inside.&quot;

====GM10 debacle====

Smith&#x27;s major new car program prior to the 1984 reorganization, GM10 (also known as W-body), has been called &quot;The biggest catastrophe in American industrial history.&quot; Beginning in 1982, and costing $7 billion, the plan was to replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick. The plan was huge in scope, calling for seven plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but the 1984 reorganization wrought havoc on the program and it never recovered. By 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10s were launched, GM was losing $2000 on every one of the cars it produced. When asked by &quot;Fortune&quot; why GM10 was such a catastrophe, Smith replied, “&quot;I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a mysterious thing. I&#x27;ve said I&#x27;ll take my share of the blame on all those things. I was part of the team.&quot;” Nonetheless, the W-body platform that sprouted from the GM10 program lasted in production in some form until 2016.

====Drive for modernization====
A defining theme of Smith&#x27;s tenure was his vision to modernize GM using advanced technology. Some have suggested he was ahead of his time in attempting to create a 21st-century organization in a company not ready for the technology. &quot;Lights out&quot; factories were envisioned, where the only employees were those supervising the robots and computers. This was obviously viewed negatively by the unions, and further strained relations. Over the decade of the 1980s, GM spent upwards of $90 billion attempting to remake itself, including a 1981 joint venture with the Japanese robot manufacturer, Fujitsu-Fanuc. With the resulting venture, GMF Robotics, GM became the largest manufacturer of robots in the world. Unfortunately, the experience failed to meet the vision, with the new robots famously painting each other instead of the cars, or robots welding doors shut. Ultimately, some robotic systems and automation installed in several plants were removed shortly after their installation. The astonishing sums expended were widely viewed as money wasted. Responding to a 1986 report on 3-year capital expenditures projected at almost $35 billion, VP of finance F. Alan Smith (no relation) opined the sum could be better spent on purchasing both Toyota and Nissan resulting in a bump in market share overnight and openly questioned whether the proposed capital expenditures would pay the same dividends; they did not. By the time Smith retired, GM had evolved from the lowest cost producer in Detroit to its highest cost producer, due in part to the drive to acquire advanced technology that never paid dividends in efficiency.

====Acquisitions and divestitures====
In 1984 Smith oversaw General Motors&#x27; acquisition of Electronic Data Systems from its founder Ross Perot for $2.55 billion, serving two purposes. First was the opportunity to modernize and automate GM to fulfill Smith&#x27;s goals; second, it was an effort to broaden out of its manufacturing base and into technology and services. As a result of the EDS acquisition, Perot became GM&#x27;s largest single shareholder, joined its board of directors, and immediately became a source of friction to Smith and a vocal and public critic of Smith and GM&#x27;s management. In 1986 Smith and the board orchestrated a $743 million buyout of Perot&#x27;s GM stock at a substantial premium over the market value of the shares. Perot accepted the buyout, but publicly denounced the expenditure as outrageous at a time GM was closing plants and laying off workers. He announced that he would put the money in escrow to give the automaker a chance to reconsider, but never actually sequestered the funds.

This merger is described in detail in the book &quot;Call Me Roger&quot; by Albert Lee, a former GM speechwriter. The structure of the deal was unusual in that EDS would be owned by GM, but Smith promised it would allow Perot autonomy to run the company. In addition, the stock of EDS became a special &#x27;Class E&#x27; GM stock, which was separate from normal GM stock, an arrangement which almost got GM kicked off the NYSE. Perot eventually agreed to the deal, because, as Lee puts it, he was sold on the idea of saving millions of American jobs by helping GM fight off Japanese competition.

The relationship between Smith, Perot, and the EDS executives ruptured openly in September 1985, during a meeting in Dallas that brought the EDS executive compensation issue to a head. Smith was reluctant to accept the EDS plan, substituting a plan of his own. Described in &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot; by Doron Levin, EDS&#x27; CFO was explaining to Smith how they felt GM&#x27;s plan was inferior, when Smith lost his temper. &quot;&quot;People in the room later would remember Smith&#x27;s angry explosion as being wondrous and terrifying at the same time: wondrous for the extreme colors and sounds it brought to the room, terrifying because none of them had ever seen someone lose his temper so completely in a business meeting. The EDS officers stared in disbelief as the chairman of the world&#x27;s biggest and most powerful company lost it.&quot;

What ensued was one of the most vitriolic corporate battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: &quot;My question is: Why haven&#x27;t we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It&#x27;s like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn&#x27;t bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it&quot;.&quot; Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, &quot;&quot;An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor&quot;. Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot&#x27;s frequent criticism of GM&#x27;s executive perks a year earlier, &quot;Perot&#x27;s office (in Dallas) &#x27;makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying &#x27;Get rid of Ross&#x27;s office&quot;&quot;&quot;.

A second large acquisition outside the automobile industry followed in 1985, when Smith announced the purchase of Hughes Aircraft Company from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for $5.2 billion. The company was then merged with GM&#x27;s Delco Electronics to form Hughes Electronics.

Smith&#x27;s purchases of EDS and Hughes were criticized as unwise diversions of resources at a time when GM could have invested more in its core automotive divisions. GM spun EDS off as an independent company in 1996. After some major acquisitions in the mid-1990s by Hughes Electronics (Magnavox Electronic Systems and PanAmSat), GM divested most of Hughes assets from 1997 to 2003, including sale of defense operations to Raytheon in 1997, the spinoff of Delphi Automotive Systems in 1999, the divestiture of Hughes Space and Communications to Boeing in 2000, and acquisition of the remaining communications and satellite operations (mostly DirecTV) by NewsCorp in 2003.

===Solar Challenge===
In 1987, Smith chose to have GM enter in the first World Solar Challenge race and he hired AeroVironment to build a winning solar-electric vehicle. The resulting car, the Sunraycer easily won the race at a cost of just under 2 million dollars. The success of the Sunraycer led directly to the AeroVironment-designed GM Impact prototype, subsequently planned for 25,000 vehicles, which in turn led to the EV-1.

==Legacy==
In 2009, Portfolio.com called Smith one of the worst American CEOs of All Time,&quot; stating, &quot;Smith...had the right idea but may have lacked the intuition to understand how his rip-up-the-carpet redo would affect the delicate web of informal communication that GM relied upon.&quot; In 2013, he was included on &quot;Fortune&quot;s list of the &quot;10 Worst Auto Chiefs,&quot; with writer Alex Taylor III stating, &quot;He wasted billions trying to revive the sagging giant through diversification (EDS and Hughes), automation (robotized factories), reorganization (two superdivisions B-O-C and C-P-C), commonization (GM-10 cars) and experimentation (Saturn). Smith&#x27;s legacy was a fleet of lookalike autos, an unqualified successor, and a mountain of debt that pushed the company close to bankruptcy in 1992.&quot;

==Personal life==
Smith served as chairman of The Business Council in 1989 and 1990. His tenure at GM ended in 1990, one year after the release of the popular underground documentary &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;, where many displaced GM workers called for Smith&#x27;s retirement. Smith voluntarily retired from GM, and later toured the new Saturn facility in Tennessee, which he brought to fruition, in 1991.

A native of Columbus, Ohio, Smith was married for 53 years to his wife Barbara. They had two sons, Roger B. Smith and Drew J. Smith; two daughters, Jennifer A. Ponski and Victoria B. Sawula; as well as six grandchildren.

Smith died on November 29, 2007, after an unspecified short illness.

<text>Nils Johan Semb (born 24 February 1959) was the coach of the Norway national football team from 1998 to 2003, presiding over 68 matches.

He led the team to its first European Football Championship in 2000. Though successful, at least in the beginning of his tenure, he drew heavy criticism for his team&#x27;s defense-oriented style, where long balls, counter-attacks and direct passes were hallmarks of their attacking style. He was replaced by Åge Hareide in 2003. He was a commentator for TV 2, then resigned in 2009 to become the Chief of Elite Football at the Football Association of Norway.

He was educated at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences.

<doc id="815579" wikidata="Q15524741" url="?curid=815579" title="Sandra Lee (chef)">
<text>Sandra Lee Christiansen (née Waldroop; born July 3, 1966), known professionally as Sandra Lee, is an American television chef and author. She is known for her &quot;Semi-Homemade&quot; cooking concept, which Lee describes as using 70 percent packaged and 30 percent fresh products. She received the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lifestyle/Culinary Show Host in 2012 for her work and her show. As the partner of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, she served as the &quot;de facto&quot; first lady of New York from 2011 to 2019, when the couple ended their relationship.

==Early life==
Lee was born in Santa Monica, California, in 1966, the daughter of Vicky Svitak and Wayne Waldroop, who had been high-school sweethearts. When Sandra was two, her mother sent her, along with her younger sister, Cindy, to live with their paternal grandmother, Lorraine Waldroop. In 1972, after divorcing Wayne, Lee&#x27;s mother moved with her girls to Sumner, Washington, where they acquired a new stepfather, whose last name (Christiansen) Lee took. Vicky had three additional children in the 1970s: Kimber, Richie, and John Paul. Due to her mother&#x27;s illness and the absence of her and her siblings&#x27; fathers, Lee effectively raised her four younger siblings. In her youth, Lee learned how to feed her younger siblings frugally with a combination of food stamps and welfare payments, an experience that informed her future approach to cooking.

Lee graduated from Onalaska High School, in Onalaska, Wisconsin, and attended the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Lee has said her family is Catholic but was raised as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. One source reported they were also Seventh-day Adventist for a time.

In December of her junior year, she left college to live near family in Malibu, California. She later attended a two-week recreational course at Le Cordon Bleu in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

==Career==
In the early 1990s, Lee created a product called &quot;Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains,&quot; a home-decorating kit designed to turn a wire rack and sheets, or other spare fabric, into decorative drapery. It was sold via infomercials and cable shopping networks. Home-shopping network QVC hired her as on-air talent. In her first 18 months, Lee sold $20 million worth of merchandise. QVC also selected Lee to launch its craft and home decorating categories on its networks in the U.K. and Germany. In 1994, she released her first DIY home improvement video series, which sold more than a million copies.

&quot;Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee&quot; premiered on the Food Network in 2003. The show ran for 15 seasons and was in the top three new weekend shows on the network for its first five years. Each episode contains entertaining and arts and crafts elements, in which Lee decorates the table setting and kitchen in accordance with the theme of the meal that she just prepared. She refers to these as &quot;tablescapes&quot;, a term she coined.

Lee&#x27;s second Food Network series, &quot;Sandra&#x27;s Money Saving Meals&quot;, began airing on May 10, 2009, in response to the Great Recession. At the time, she was the only host on the Food Network with two cooking series running concurrently. Kurt Soller, writing for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, described her as &quot;among TV&#x27;s most successful female chefs&quot;. , her shows have aired in 63 countries.
She has authored 27 books, including Sandra Lee &quot;Semi-Homemade: Cool Kids Cooking&quot; (October 2006) and a memoir, &quot;Made From Scratch&quot;, which was released in November 2007. Her book &quot;Semi-Homemade Cooking&quot; appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. A magazine based on her show, &quot;Sandra Lee Semi-Homemade&quot;, was released in 2009. In late 2009, Lee hosted &quot;Sandra Lee Celebrates&quot;, a series of four one-hour specials that aired on HGTV.

In 2012, Lee won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lifestyle/Culinary Host for Semi-Homemade Cooking.

Also in 2012, she started a monthly lifestyle magazine, &quot;Sandra Lee&quot;, in partnership with &quot;TV Guide&quot;. &quot;People&quot; magazine has included her in its list of &quot;Most Beautiful&quot; people multiple times.

In early 2020, Lee began creating her &quot;Top Shelf&quot; video series for Today.com, showcasing new ways to make meals from products commonly found in pantries. An April 2020 &quot;New York Times&quot; article authored by Jessica Bennett called Lee &quot;the queen of making something out of nothing&quot;. In late 2020, Lee hosted a series of holiday segments, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Lifetime&quot;, on Lifetime.

==Documentaries==
In 2015, shortly before being diagnosed with cancer, Lee started her own production company. She created &quot;Rx: Early Detection – A Cancer Journey With Sandra Lee&quot;, a documentary about her experiences with cancer, which aired on HBO. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2018, at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, and on HBO in October 2018. Lee received the Made in New York Award at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in November 2018 for her work on the documentary.

Lee was an executive producer of the documentary about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, titled &quot;&quot;, in collaboration with Academy Award-winning director Freida Lee Mock, Geralyn Dreyfous, and others. It premiered on Starz in March 2021 as part of the network&#x27;s Women&#x27;s History Month programming.

==Philanthropy==

Lee co-founded the Los Angeles chapter of UNICEF in 2000. She donated the proceeds from her second cookbook to God&#x27;s Love We Deliver and Project Angel Food, two organizations that deliver food to homebound individuals. In 2015, she led a UNICEF team on a mission to Haiti in her role as a special nutrition emissary for the organization. The U.S. division of the UN&#x27;s World Food Program, the world&#x27;s largest humanitarian organization, appointed Lee to its board of directors in May 2020.

Lee was a spokesperson for Share Our Strength&#x27;s No Kid Hungry campaign for more than ten years and created No Kid Hungry&#x27;s annual fundraiser, the Great American Bake Sale. Her first Great American Bake Sale, in 2011, raised more than $50,000. She has also worked with the Elton John AIDS Foundation and serves on its board.

== Critical response ==
Hsiao-Ching Chou of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote a review of Lee&#x27;s cookbook &quot;Semi-Homemade Cooking&quot; in 2002 that criticized both her recipes and her &quot;semi-homemade&quot; concept. She then wrote a follow-up column, noting that the review received a response &quot;that was more impassioned than I anticipated&quot;. Chou wrote that, though most readers agreed with her, a number of readers took Lee&#x27;s position, including one who wrote, &quot;Lots of people who don&#x27;t want to take the time to shred a cup of carrots want to cook a good meal.&quot;

Kurt Soller, writing for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, compared Lee&#x27;s impact upon television cooking with that of Julia Child, noting that although Lee&#x27;s show &quot;is the furthest from Child&#x27;s methods&quot;, both women &quot;filled a niche that hasn&#x27;t yet been explored&quot;.

Amanda Hesser, in a 2003 review of &quot;Semi-Homemade Cooking&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that Lee&#x27;s recipes, in their use of packaged ingredients, can end up costing more, having harder-to-find ingredients, taking longer to make, and tasting worse than equivalent recipes made from scratch. Hesser also wrote that, in her cookbooks, Lee &quot;encourages a dislike for cooking, and gives people an excuse for feeding themselves and their families mediocre food filled with preservatives.&quot;

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, both Jessica Bennett in &quot;New York Times&quot; and Jaya Saxena in &quot;Eater&quot; noted that the context of pandemic scarcity made the &quot;semi-homemade&quot; concept feel newly relevant. Of Lee, Saxena wrote, &quot;her show, &quot;Semi-Homemade Cooking&quot;, might be the perfect way to cook through quarantine.&quot;

===Kwanzaa cake===
Much criticism of Lee coalesced around a recipe for &quot;Kwanzaa Cake&quot; that she demonstrated on a 2003 episode of &quot;Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee&quot;. The recipe consisted of angel food cake topped with icing, cinnamon, apple pie filling, pumpkin seeds and corn nuts (which she referred to as &quot;acorns&quot;), all of which were store-bought, with seven Kwanzaa candles then inserted into the cake.

Food writer Anthony Bourdain, who was harshly critical of Lee in general, described the video clip of this segment of the show as &quot;eye searing&quot; and &quot;a war crime&quot;. The cake was called &quot;scary&quot; by the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;the most ghastly-sounding dish in Lee&#x27;s culinary repertoire&quot; by &quot;Tulsa World&quot;. &quot;Salon.com&quot; wrote that the video &quot;takes pride of place in the pantheon of hilarious culinary disaster videos&quot;.

Cookbook author Denise Vivaldo, who claims to have ghostwritten recipes for many celebrity chefs, claimed in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in December 2010 that she was responsible for the recipe, but that the candles were Lee&#x27;s idea, for which Vivaldo apologized. She also wrote that Lee &quot;has incredibly bad food taste&quot;. A week later, the post was removed after Lee&#x27;s lawyer threatened legal action. Lee has said this recipe is the only one of hers whose criticism she has taken to heart, and that the recipe was due to the Food Network then dictating the show&#x27;s content.

==Personal life==
From 2001 to 2005, she was married to then-KB Home CEO and philanthropist Bruce Karatz, for whom she converted to Judaism.

In the fall of 2005, Lee entered into a relationship with Andrew Cuomo, who served as the 56th Governor of New York from 2011 until his resignation in August 2021. The two lived in a home owned by Lee in Chappaqua. On September 25, 2019, the couple announced that they had ended their relationship.

Lee has been reported to be dating the Algerian-born Abdulwahab Benyoucef, an actor professionally known as Ben Youcef, since March 2021. He is younger than her by 13 years, Friends of the couple reportedly affectionately refer to them as &quot;Bendra.&quot;

===Cancer and advocacy===
Lee announced on May 12, 2015 that she had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. By then she had undergone a lumpectomy, and was scheduled to have a double mastectomy later in the week. Governor Cuomo was to take some personal time to be with her during and after the surgery. In August 2015, she contracted an infection in her right breast that resulted in her going on bed rest and receiving intravenous drugs for three months. Lee announced that she was cancer free in late 2015. Seven years after undergoing her double mastectomy, Lee underwent a hysterectomy procedure in March 2022. Her surgery was successful.

In 2016, Lee pushed for the passage of the $91 million &quot;No Excuses&quot; law in the state of New York, which provided for expanded breast cancer screening and removed insurance co-pays for mammograms. She subsequently advocated that other states pass their own versions of the &quot;No Excuses&quot; law. Lee was a keynote speaker at the Susan G. Komen Advocacy Summit for breast cancer awareness in Washington, D.C., in May 2019. She also became an ambassador for Stand Up to Cancer and produced the documentary &quot;Rx: Early Detection – A Cancer Journey With Sandra Lee&quot;.

<doc id="815581" wikidata="Q8025460" url="?curid=815581" title="Winker Watson">
<text>Winker Watson is a British comic strip, created by Eric Roberts, which ran in the British comic book magazine &quot;The Dandy&quot; for almost half a century. It debuted in 1961 and only terminated its run in 2007. It was revived in 2012.

==Concept==

Winker first appeared in the 1961 Dandy Book (published September 1960), and then appeared in the weekly Dandy on 1 April 1961 in issue Number 1010, and was quickly established as a character of great wit and appeal. Probably modeled on the Greyfriars stories and on Harry Wharton, Winker is a pupil of the Third Form of Greytowers Boarding School, he is known as the &quot;wangler&quot; of the school, constantly playing tricks and avoiding unpleasant school activities, much to the chagrin of his teacher Mr Clarence Creep (known to the boys as &quot;Creepy&quot;). Creep also has a sister called Agnes, who runs the nearby Trinity Hall Girls School, constructed in 1989 after the previous one burnt down. Around that area there also seems to be a St Jennifer&#x27;s School for Girls, though this may just be a continuity error. Greytowers is next door to a police training school, although this was later reportedly abandoned and derelict.

Winker Watson is a rare breed for a kids comic, as his stories are often continuous from issue to issue, including the long-running saga of his uncle Arnold arriving as Physical Training instructor and Winker&#x27;s endless attempts to get rid of him. There was also the long-running story dealing with the unjust expulsion of Winker&#x27;s younger brother Wally, and the elder sibling&#x27;s attempts to keep him in the school until the end of term so their parents would know nothing until he had been exonerated. A third example is that of Mr Creep&#x27;s own secret stowaway; the teacher&#x27;s good-for-nothing twin brother John, who was on the run and needed somewhere to stay, forced his brother to let him hide in his own quarters within the school. Other storylines involved Slasher Scragg (a delinquent boy recruited by the school staff and posing as a pupil to act as their spy on Winker&#x27;s activities) and &#x27;the phantom of Greytowers&#x27; (an elusive figure causing trouble for which Winker and his friends often got the blame; it turned out to be a teenage boy in hiding after escaping from a young offenders&#x27; institute). The early 90s saw perhaps the most bizarre running story of the strip&#x27;s history, as Greytowers was invaded by aliens, who used mind control powers to take over several characters and tried to cast the school adrift in space, until Winker used the aliens&#x27; allergy to pig swill to defeat them. Stories throughout 2003 and 2004 were reworkings of 1970s scripts concerning Winker&#x27;s schemes to foil the plans of Robin Boodle, a consistently annoying rich boy, and who had been renamed Darby Doshman (in the late 1980s, there was a similar reworking in which the rich boy became Jonathan Dosh). At the same time, Classics from the Comics was reprinting the Robin Boodle strips, sometimes in the same week. An old days storyline of a circus moving in next to the school was also redone, although it is unknown if any specific strips were reworked.

Winker&#x27;s best pal is a lad called Tim Trott (nicknamed &quot;Trotty&quot; by Winker), though, apart from Winker&#x27;s other friends Sally and Sandy, no other characters have emerged with any great regularity, despite the number of boys within the school. The headmaster has made frequent appearances, but mainly with Creep rather than any of the boys. Also occasionally seen is the school cook, nicknamed Cookie. In the late-1970s and early-1980s, Winker have frequent run-ins with three Sixth Formers called The Hoods. They dressed in long white coats and masks similar to the ones used by the Ku Klux Klan to hide their identities. They would steal and play tricks on the lower years and occasionally beat up Winker and his friends. As they were older and bigger than the third form boys, Winker would have to use his wits rather than his fists to fight against them. Though Winker often got into trouble, he always managed to wangle his way out of getting caned, well almost. Just the once he did get &quot;six&quot;.

Comparisons with Just William are inevitable, including the fact that Winker is always in Form 3, no matter how much time passes, and stories often involve ends and beginnings of new school terms.

==History==

The strip was drawn by Eric Roberts until his death in 1982. Afterwards, the strip ran mostly as reprints for the rest of the decade (though Tom Williams and Evi De Bono drew strips for the Dandy annuals), until Terry Bave took over. For the first few years he drew in the style of Roberts (though his style was still fairly noticeable), but as the 90s progressed his style became more and more noticeable. He was drawing the strip in his own style. Bave continued drawing it until 2002, when Stevie White took over, producing the strip regularly until 2007, with further appearances in the 2012 Annual. Wilbur Dawbarn took over from the 2013 Annual, with an ironic, tongue-in-cheek take on the character. In the 2018 Annual, Wilbur was replaced by Irish Cartoonist Alan Ryan.

==In popular culture==

The strip also has been a target of satire with wordplay by alternative comedians and other, involving phrases such as &quot;Wanker Watson&quot;, and playing on the perception of boarding schools being full of sexually frustrated teenage aristocrats. For instance, &quot;Viz&quot; comic ran a parody strip called Wanker Watson. There is also a British racehorse called Winker Watson after the character.

<text>Peter&#x27;s Pocket Grandpa was a fictional character in a comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Dandy&quot;. The comic first appeared in issue #1771, dated 1 November 1975, and was drawn by Ron Spencer for the majority of its run, with a few later strips being drawn by John Geering. The strip was essentially an updated version of another strip called &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Pocket Grandpa&quot;, which had exactly the same premise and had first appeared in the &quot;Dandy&quot; in 1940.

The strip told the rather whimsical and sad story of a schoolboy named Peter Parker, who lived with his parents and grandfather in perfectly ordinary circumstances until a visit to a fairground left a gypsy angry after an argument with Grandpa. The gypsy promptly put a curse on Grandpa which left him just six inches tall. As a result, the adventures of the family mainly centred on Peter and his Grandpa, who was in constant danger of being eaten by cats, closed inside books etc., but also handy for getting through tight gaps on various archetypal schoolboy adventures. It ran until the early 1980s, and later inspired the &quot;Viz&quot; strip &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Miniature Grandpa&quot;.

From 2009 to 2014, a program called &quot;Grandpa in My Pocket&quot; appeared on CBeebies, based on the comic.</text><links>

<doc id="815629" wikidata="Q4997082" url="?curid=815629" title="Bully Beef and Chips">
<text>Bully Beef and Chips was a British comic strip, created by Jimmy Hughes. It first appeared in 1967 in the British comics magazine &quot;The Dandy&quot;. In 2007, a set of &quot;Dandy&quot; comics, scripts and storyboards created by Hughes, including material from Bully Beef and Chips, was sold at auction for ().

==Concept==
The strip told the story of two warring boys – a tall, ugly thug called Bully Beef and a softer, more cunning boy called Chips. The name &quot;Bully Beef and Chips&quot; comes from a quickly-prepared meal – corned beef and chips – with &quot;Bully beef&quot; being a phrase used for &quot;corned beef&quot;. 

Stories of these two were identically themed – Bully Beef (Beefy) would constantly play violent tricks on Chips, who would then get his climactic revenge in some way right at the end. Originally, Bully Beef&#x27;s eyes were always covered by his hair, but towards the end of the 1980s they became partly visible, and then entirely visible when original artist Jimmy Hughes retired in 1993 and was replaced by Gordon Bell and later Sid Burgon. Burgon changed the characters&#x27; personalities a little, and made Chips just as much of a bully as Beefy at times, occasionally resulting in Beefy coming out on top.

==Revivals==

It was revived in 2009 in &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot;, drawn by Wayne Thompson, but this did not last long. After a redesign, it reappeared, again drawn by Thompson, in May 2012. Beefy had made an appearance in both &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Beano Annual&quot; earlier in 2009 – specifically in a reprint Fred&#x27;s Bed strip from around 1992, where Fred visited both Beanotown and Dandytown, and Beefy was among several characters he met. The annual appearance was in the Reservoir Dodge story, as one of a gang of villains watching Baby Face Finlayson attempt to drown Roger the Dodger, Walter the Softy, Minnie the Minx, Billy Whizz and Calamity James.
The strip also appeared in both the 2011 and 2012 &quot;Dandy&quot; annuals, the 2011 one drawn by an unknown artist whose style resembled Jimmy Hughes&#x27;s, and in 2012 drawn by Laura Howell.

==Parodies==
Bully Beef has been parodied in &quot;Viz&quot; as Biffa Bacon, Cedric Soft being the equivalent of Chips. However, the Viz strip mostly concerns Biffa&#x27;s interactions with his equally violent (and considerably stronger) parents.

<doc id="815682" wikidata="Q858028" url="?curid=815682" title="Cercidiphyllum">
<text>Cercidiphyllum is a genus containing two species of plants, both commonly called katsura. They are the sole members of the monotypic family Cercidiphyllaceae. The genus is native to Japan and China and unrelated to &quot;Cercis&quot; (redbuds).

==Description==
The type species, &quot;Cercidiphyllum japonicum&quot;, can reach in height, and is one of the largest hardwoods in Asia. The other species, &quot;Cercidiphyllum magnificum&quot;, is much smaller, rarely reaching over in height. &quot;Cercidiphyllum&quot; produces spurs along its twigs. These are short stems with closely spaced leaves. The foliage is dimorphic. According to a recent description &quot;short shoots bear broadly cordate or reniform, palmately veined leaves with crenate margins; long shoots bear elliptic to broadly ovate leaves with entire or finely serrate margins.&quot; Leaf size varies from 3–8 cm long and 3–5.5 cm broad. The genus is dioecious, having separate male and female trees. The small inconspicuous flowers are produced in early spring and wind-pollinated; the fruit is a cluster of 2-4 small pods, each pod 1–2 cm long with numerous small, flattened and winged seeds. The fruits mature in autumn and release their seeds in autumn through winter.

The leaves have a strong, sweet smell in the fall, described as caramel or Madeira cake-like. The smell comes from a combination of maltol and a sugary compound in the leaves and is strongest when they are brown. In German, &quot;Cercidiphyllum&quot; trees are named after their scent; or (&quot;pie tree&quot; or &quot;gingerbread tree&quot;).

==Nomenclature==
Katsura () is the Japanese name for the tree. The scientific name &quot;Cercidiphyllum&quot; refers to the close resemblance of the leaves to those of &quot;Cercis&quot; (redbuds); these two unrelated genera can however be distinguished easily as redbud leaves are alternate, not opposite.

==Species==
The two species are:
*&quot;Cercidiphyllum japonicum&quot;. Throughout the range of the genus. Typically a multi-stemmed tree to 40–45 m tall in the wild, though typically smaller in cultivation. Bark rough, furrowed. Leaves smaller, not over 4.5 cm long and 3.2 cm broad; stipules falling soon after leafing out in spring. Seed winged only at lower end. Plants from China were at one time separated as &quot;C. japonicum&quot; var. &quot;sinense&quot;, but no consistent difference between Japanese and Chinese origins has been found.
*&quot;Cercidiphyllum magnificum&quot;. Endemic to central Honshū, where it grows at higher altitudes than &quot;C. japonicum&quot;. A small tree, not more than 10 m tall. Bark smooth. Leaves larger, up to 8 cm long and 5.5 cm broad; stipules persistent. Seed winged at both ends.

==Cultivation==
Katsura is grown as an ornamental tree for its delicate heart-shaped leaves and bright autumn colour, a mix of bright yellow, pink and orange-red. Where conditions are suitable, it is fast-growing, but it is very sensitive to drought and needs deep, permanently moist soil. Under drought conditions, the species will abscise its leaves; however refoliation may occur once water is made available. Of particular interest is the scent produced by the leaves in the autumn, resembling burnt brown sugar or cotton candy. Trees in cultivation, like those in natural environments, tend to sucker from the base when young and become multi-stemmed at maturity; pruning to maintain a single stem is not advised.

Within &quot;Cercidiphyllum japonicum&quot;, several cultivars with pendulous branches are grown for their unique weeping habit. Two general types exist. Those with a strong central leader, or excurrent growth, are all one clone originating in Morioka City, Japan. This cultivar is known as &#x27;Morioka Weeping&#x27; and can reach over in height. The other type fails to form a central leader and is rounded in habit. There are several clones of this, including &#x27;Amazing Grace&#x27; and &#x27;Tidal Wave&#x27;.

Both the species &quot;C. japonicum&quot; and the weeping form &quot;C. japonicum&quot; f. &quot;pendulum&quot; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Uses==
Katsura wood is often used to make gobans, i.e. boards for the game Go.

== Fossil record ==
The genus is known from fossils at the end of the Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of North America, and the Cenozoic of North America, Europe and Asia.

<doc id="815691" wikidata="Q1194726" url="?curid=815691" title="The Happy Return">
<text>The Happy Return (Beat to Quarters in the US) is the first of the Horatio Hornblower novels by C. S. Forester. It was published in 1937. The American title is derived from the expression &quot;beat to quarters&quot;, which was the signal to prepare for combat. This book is sixth by internal chronology of the series (including the unfinished &quot;Hornblower and the Crisis&quot;). Hornblower&#x27;s past history as described here does not entirely accord with his history as revealed in the stories written later, but Forester never revised the book.

It is one of three &quot;Hornblower&quot; novels adapted for the British-American film &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.&quot;, released in 1951.

==Plot summary==
In June 1808, Captain Horatio Hornblower is in command of the 36-gun frigate HMS &quot;Lydia&quot;, with secret orders to sail to the Pacific coast of Nicaragua (near modern Choluteca, Choluteca) and supply a prominent landowner, Don Julian Alvarado (&quot;descendant&quot; of Pedro de Alvarado by a fictional marriage to a daughter of Moctezuma), with muskets and powder for a planned uprising against the Spanish authorities. Upon meeting Don Julian, Hornblower discovers that he is a megalomaniac who calls himself &quot;El Supremo&quot; (which Forester translates as &quot;the Almighty&quot;), views himself as a deity, and has been killing those who he regards as &quot;unenlightened&quot; because they do not recognise El Supremo&#x27;s divine status. 

While Hornblower replenishes his supplies, the 50-gun Spanish warship &quot;Natividad&quot; is sighted off the coast. Unwilling to risk fighting the much more powerful ship in a sea battle, Hornblower hides nearby until it anchors and then captures it in a surprise nighttime boarding. El Supremo demands that it be turned over to him so that he may have a navy. After hiding the captured Spanish officers to save them from being murdered by El Supremo, Hornblower honors the request and quickly departs for England. Off the coast of Panama he encounters a Spanish mail lugger, from which an envoy arrives to inform him of a new alliance between Spain and England against Napoleon.

When Hornblower visits Panama City to meet with the Spanish Viceroy, the Englishwoman Lady Barbara Wellesley, a (fictional) sister of Marquess Wellesley and Sir Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington), comes aboard. The packet ship she was on in the Caribbean had been captured some time before. Freed when Spain changed sides, and fleeing a yellow fever epidemic ashore, she requests passage back to England. Hornblower reluctantly takes Lady Barbara and her maid Hebe aboard, warning her that he must first hunt and destroy the &quot;Natividad&quot; before El Supremo can capture a Spanish ship carrying funds crucial to the Spanish war effort from Manila to Acapulco.

In the subsequent battle Hornblower uses masterful tactics to sink the &quot;Natividad&quot;, though the &quot;Lydia&quot; herself is heavily damaged. Limping back to Panama to effect repairs, Hornblower is informed that, now that there is no further threat from the &quot;Natividad&quot;, he is not welcome in any Spanish American port. He manages to find a natural harbour on the island of Coiba, where he refits.

After completing repairs, Hornblower encounters the haughty Spanish envoy once again on the same lugger. He is invited aboard the lugger and finds El Supremo chained to the deck on his way to execution.

Hornblower sets sail for England. On the long voyage home he and Lady Barbara become strongly attracted to each other. She makes the first overt advances and they embrace passionately, but Barbara&#x27;s maid Hebe walking in on them brings Hornblower to the realisation that a ship&#x27;s captain must not indulge in sexual dalliance with a passenger. He tells Barbara, truthfully, that he is married. After being rejected, Barbara avoids him as best she can. The &quot;Lydia&quot; arrives at Saint Helena soon afterwards and Lady Barbara transfers to a more spacious ship.

==Historical References==

The El Supremo character was inspired by a contemporary dictator of Paraguay, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia (1766-1840) . His official title was &quot;Supreme and Perpetual Dictator of Paraguay&quot;, but he was popularly known as El Supremo.

<text>Jean Léopold Dominique (31 July 1930 – 3 April 2000) was a Haitian journalist and activist for human rights and democracy in Haiti. His station, Radio Haiti-Inter, was the first to broadcast news, investigative reporting, and political analysis in Haitian Creole, the language spoken by most Haitian people. On 3 April 2000 he was assassinated as he arrived for work at Radio Haiti-Inter. An extensive though turbulent investigation failed to officially identify and bring to justice the primary perpetrators, who remain at large.

==Personal life and early career==
Jean Dominique was born in Port-au-Prince to Léopold Dominique, a trader originally from Rivière Froide, and Marcelle (Pereira) Dominique. As a child, Dominique frequently accompanied his father on trips throughout the Haitian countryside, which led him to know and understand the lives and struggles of peasant farmers. Dominique&#x27;s elder brother Philippe was an officer in the Haitian army who, along with fellow officers Alix Pasquet and Henry Perpignan, was killed in an attempt to occupy the Casernes Dessalines and overthrow François Duvalier in July 1958. His eldest sister, Madeleine Dominique Paillère, was a well-known author and intellectual.

After completing his primary and secondary schooling at Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague, Dominique began studying at the Faculté d’Agronomie in Port-au-Prince in 1948, where he received his degree in 1951. Dominique then received a scholarship to studied genetically modified cacao and coffee plants at the in Paris. He returned to Haiti in 1955 leaving his girlfriend while she is pregnant and began to work as an agronomist in in the Nord department with the Institut Haïtien de Crédit Agricole et Industriel as well as the Société Haitiano-Américaine de Développement Agricole (SHADA), primarily on sisal and rubber production. He worked alongside agronomist Edner Vil, who was subsequently arrested and killed by the Duvalier regime for promoting the rights of peasant farmers. Dominique, who had been working with the ti peyizan to defend their land rights against the chefs de section (local Duvalierist authorities) and wealthy landowners, was arrested a few weeks after his brother&#x27;s attempt to overthrow the regime, and he spent six months in prison in Gonaïves. After his release, he was no longer permitted to work as an agronomist, and instead became a journalist.

In the early 1960s, after his release from prison, Dominique went to work as a program host and cultural commentator at Haiti&#x27;s first independent radio station, Radio Haïti, interviewing writers and scholars. In 1972, he purchased the lease to the station from Ricardo Widmaïer and renamed it Radio Haiti-Inter. It was the first radio station in Haiti to broadcast political analysis, interviews, and investigative reporting in Haitian Creole, the language spoken by the entire population of Haiti, in addition to French, which was the language of the ruling elite.

During the 1960s, Dominique also founded Haiti&#x27;s first film club at the Institut Français in Port-au-Prince, which he understood to be a way of subverting and resisting the political repression of the Duvalier dictatorship. In 1965, the film club was banned following a screening of Alain Resnais&#x27;s Night and Fog, an anti-fascist film about the Nazi concentration camps. In 1961, Dominique co-directed and narrated Haiti&#x27;s first documentary film, Mais, je suis belle (But, I Am Beautiful), an ironic film about Caribbean beauty pageants. Dominique remained a staunch supporter of Haitian cinema, and collaborated with Haitian filmmakers such as Rassoul Labuchin.

Dominique was married to fellow journalist Michèle Montas, who became the co-director of Radio Haiti after Dominique&#x27;s assassination. He had three daughters by previous marriages: the writer Jan J. (J.J.) Dominique, Nadine Dominique, and Dolores Dominique Neptune. He also had a son, the novelist Denis Boucolon from a relationship with an Afro-Caribbean student from Guadeloupe, Maryse Boucolon.

==Career at Radio Haïti-Inter==
===1971–1980===
Throughout the 1970s, Jean Dominique used Radio Haiti to highlights aspects of Haitian culture rooted in its Creole-speaking majority and repressed for almost two centuries by its French-speaking elite. Dominique and Radio Haiti also reported increasingly on events that would challenge the regime of Jean-Claude Duvalier, often strategically and indirectly to circumvent the regime&#x27;s censorship laws. For example, Radio Haiti reported in 1972 for weeks, on the fall of the dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio &quot;Tachito&quot; Somoza Debayle, as a proxy for talking about Duvalier. In 1973 and 1976, Dominique reported from the annual Vodou pilgrimage at Saut-d’Eau on worshippers’ lamentations and entreaties to the spirits: an implicit way of talking about peasant resistance : “We were under Jean-Claude Duvalier, we were under [high-ranking Macoutes like] Luc Désir, Jean Valmé, Luckner Cambronne, and company We were under the tigers!” Dominique later explained. “The people opened their arms in front of the pilgrimage site, they looked toward the church, and they described their misery. They described their oppression, how the life was squeezed out of them [&quot;peze-souse&quot;]. They described how everything was being destroyed [&quot;kraze-brize&quot;]. They spelled it all out. They described it in a litany, for hours. For days.”

As the Haitian government relied on assistance from the United States, Duvalier had little choice but to comply with certain human rights rules and principles while Jimmy Carter was president. However, as Carter&#x27;s term came to an end, Duvalier&#x27;s opposition to the free press became more pronounced. In October 1980, he announced that &quot;le bal est fini&quot; (the party is over) for the independent press. Dominique, reading the writing on the wall, responded with one of his most famous editorials, entitled “Bon appétit, messieurs,” addressed to the journalists of the state press. “For you, the banquet shall resume. And you will not hear any discordant sounds, any noise that might disturb your appetites. You will not be distracted from your plentiful feast by the cries of the poor, the screams of the boat people devoured by sharks, the gunshots killing our cane-cutter brothers in Santo Domingo or in Nassau or La Romana... No, you will not hear those discordant, disagreeable noises that might trouble your meal, that might prevent you from celebrating -- it will be only silence... So you may celebrate at ease, gentlemen! At ease! And in that profound silence: Bon appétit, messieurs!”

On 28 November 1980, shortly after Ronald Reagan won the US presidential election, Duvalier cracked down on the independent press, human rights activists, and union leaders in Haiti. Duvalier&#x27;s militia, the Tontons Macoutes, ransacked and destroyed Radio Haiti&#x27;s studios. Nearly all of Radio Haiti&#x27;s journalists were arrested; some, including station manager Richard Brisson, were tortured. Most were released within days and then exiled. An order was issued for Jean Dominique to be killed on sight. He spent two months in asylum at the Venezuelan embassy, before he joined Montas in New York, where they married in 1983.

===1986–1991===
On 5 March 1986, less than a month after Duvalier&#x27;s ouster, Dominique and Montas returned to Haiti, and were greeted at the airport by nearly 60,000 people. That October, Radio Haiti reopened with funds raised by ordinary Haitian people.

Through the late 1980s, as Haiti endured successive military coups d’état, Dominique continued to advocate for democratic participation, human rights, peasant rights, and for the removal of Duvalierist and Macoute elements from the government and the army. He devoted a great deal of airtime and analysis, for example, to the July 1987 massacre of peasant farmers by landowners and Macoutes in Jean Rabel. Haiti&#x27;s first democratic elections were scheduled for 29 November 1987, but were violently suppressed by the army, which slaughtered voters at Ruelle Vaillant and destroyed electoral bureaus throughout the country. Radio Haiti came under armed attack that day, as ordered by Williams Régala; Dominique and the other journalists stood on the roof throwing rocks and bottles as the army fired machine guns and grenades.

Dominique was an early supporter of the Lavalas movement and Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the parish priest and outspoken proponent of liberation theology. Radio Haiti covered the 11 September 1988 massacre in which attachés under the orders of Port-au-Prince mayor Franck Romain massacred parishioners at Aristide&#x27;s St. Jean Bosco church, and interviewed Aristide several times as a priest and as a presidential candidate, and, finally, after his victory in Haiti&#x27;s first democratic elections in December 1990.

When the military under Raoul Cédras overthrew the government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991, Radio Haiti once more had to close and Dominique and Montas again went into exile in New York. During these years, Dominique published op eds and appeared on the Charlie Rose show to encourage a return to constitutional order in Haiti. He also collaborated with the American filmmaker Jonathan Demme on the interviews that would eventually become the documentary &quot;The Agronomist&quot;, and on an unfinished project on the History of Haitian Cinema. In June 1993, Dominique was part of Aristide&#x27;s entourage at the Governors Island meeting between the democratically elected government in exile and the leaders of the military junta. Dominique returned to Haiti in 1994, after Aristide&#x27;s return to power, and reopened Radio Haiti the following year.

===1995–2000===
In the final years of his life, Dominique concentrated on issues of state corruption and criminal negligence by the private sector. He investigated Pharval Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company, for selling cough syrup contaminated with diethylene glycol that was responsible for the poisoning of two hundred children, of whom sixty died. He also denounced the importation of medical-grade ethanol that was being sold as counterfeit &quot;clairin&quot; (high-proof undistilled sugar cane spirits), sickening and killing people who consumed it while undercutting the livelihood of Haiti&#x27;s sugar planters and distillers.

As a journalist who emphasized his own political objectivity and that of his staff, Dominique took pains to remain nonpartisan in his professional activities. He did, however, strongly support grassroots peasants’ rights groups, especially KOZEPEP whose leader, Charles Suffrard, was a close friend and collaborator of Dominique. Though as a private citizen Dominique was an early supporter of the Lavalas movement, he later investigated Aristide and other members of Fanmi Lavalas for corruption and misappropriation of government funds, and for betraying the promise of the &quot;twa wòch dife&quot;, the three cornerstones of the Lavalas movement: participation, justice, and transparency.

In a tense 16 December 1996 &quot;Face à l’Opinion&quot; interview, Dominique questioned Aristide about state corruption, particularly in his &quot;petits projets de la présidence&quot;. Dominique also took on former police chief, Dany Toussaint, for attempting to take control of the country&#x27;s security apparatus after the assassination of his rival for the position of Secretary of State for Public Security, Jean Lamy. As a result of this, Toussaint&#x27;s supporters surrounded and attacked the radio station building. In February 2000, Toussaint&#x27;s lawyers Gérard Georges and Jean-Claude Nord openly made death threats against Jean Dominique and Michèle Montas on the airwaves of Serge Beaulieu&#x27;s New York-based Duvalierist radio station Radio Liberté. This led Dominique to declare in an October 1999 editorial, “I know that [Toussaint] has the money to pay and arm his followers. Here, I have no other weapon than my journalist&#x27;s pen! And my microphone and my unquenchable faith as a militant for true change!... If Dany Toussaint tries anything else against me or the station, and if I am still alive, I will close the place down after I have denounced these maneuvers one more time and I will go in exile once more with my wife and children.”

==Assassination and investigation==
On 3 April 2000, at the age of 69, Dominique was shot four times in the chest and neck as he arrived for work at Radio Haïti. A station employee named Jean-Claude Louissaint was also killed in the attack. President René Préval ordered three days of official mourning, and 15,000 people, among them 10,000 peasant farmers, attended the joint funeral at Stade Sylvio Cator in downtown Port-au-Prince on 8 April. On 15 April, more than 5,000 peasant farmers from the Artibonite gathered in Pont-Sondé to pay tribute, and the following day, Dominique&#x27;s ashes were poured into the Artibonite River at Passe Caneau, so that, in the words of Charles Suffrard, Dominique could continue to nourish each grain of rice the river reached.

In the years following Dominique&#x27;s assassination, civil society and grassroots groups in Haiti held large public protests and sit-ins calling for justice for Dominique and Louissaint. International human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders, launched years-long campaigns demanding justice for Jean Dominique.

There have been several obstructions and irregularities in the investigation into the murders, originating in the police, parliament, and the executive branch. In 2000, supporters of chief suspect Dany Toussaint, some of them armed, threatened to set fire to the courthouse, and in 2001, Toussaint (then a sitting senator for the Fanmi Lavalas party) claimed parliamentary immunity from appearing in court, which the senate refused to revoke. The president of the Senate, Yvon Neptune, pronounced that a “little judge” could not summon a senator. The Minister of Justice at the time, Gary Lissade, had previously been Dany Toussaint&#x27;s attorney. The first judge in the Jean Dominique case, Claudy Gassant, was subject to repeated threats to his safety, and in 2002, Aristide refused to renew his mandate. In March 2003, Judge Bernard Saint-Vil concluded that a small group of low-level criminals were responsible for the murder, but that there was insufficient evidence to indict Dany Toussaint—findings that Dominique&#x27;s widow Michèle Montas contested in an appellate court, demanding that the intellectual authors of the crime be found and punished. In December 2004, more than 75% of documents relating to the investigation disappeared from the Cour de Cassation (Haiti&#x27;s Supreme Court). In addition, several suspects and witnesses died under mysterious circumstances. Most recently, in March 2015 Aristide&#x27;s former chief of security Oriel Jean was gunned down by unknown assailants, after which journalist Guy Delva released an interview in which Jean suggested that Aristide had ordered Dominique&#x27;s assassination. To date, the perpetrators of the crime have never been brought to justice.

On Christmas Day 2002, there was an attempt on Michèle Montas&#x27;s life in which her bodyguard, Maxime Seïde, was murdered. Amid increasing threats to the safety of Radio Haïti&#x27;s journalists, the station closed for good in February 2003.

==Legacy==
Jonathan Demme covered the life and death of Dominique in his 2003 documentary &quot;The Agronomist&quot;.

The Centre de Production Agricole Jean L. Dominique in Marmelade, in the north of Haiti, created in 2001 by former President René Preval in memory of Dominique, is an agricultural training center for coffee and cacao producers. A reforestation hub, it is also home to a cooperative of citrus growers, with a juice processing plant, while the bamboo trees on the grounds are used for the production of furniture.

The archives of Radio Haiti-Inter are currently being processed by the Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Duke University, with the goal of preserving, digitizing, and digitally repatriating Radio Haiti&#x27;s recordings to Haiti.

<text>A database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the client–server model. Database management systems (DBMSs) frequently provide database-server functionality, and some database management systems (such as MySQL) rely exclusively on the client–server model for database access (while others, like SQLite, are meant for use as an embedded database).

Users access a database server either through a &quot;front end&quot; running on the user&#x27;s computerwhich displays requested dataor through the &quot;back end&quot;, which runs on the server and handles tasks such as data analysis and storage.

In a master–slave model, database master servers are central and primary locations of data while database slave servers are synchronized backups of the master acting as proxies.

Most database applications respond to a query language. Each database understands its query language and converts each submitted query to server-readable form and executes it to retrieve results.

Examples of proprietary database applications include Oracle, IBM Db2, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. Examples of free software database applications include PostgreSQL; and under the GNU General Public Licence include Ingres and MySQL. Every server uses its own query logic and structure. The SQL (Structured Query Language) query language is more or less the same on all relational database applications.

For clarification, a database server is simply a server that maintains services related to clients via database applications.

DB-Engines lists over 300 DBMSs in its ranking.

== History ==
The foundations for modeling large sets of data were first introduced by Charles Bachman in 1969. Bachman introduced Data Structure Diagrams (DSDs) as a means to graphically represent data. DSDs provided a means to represent the relationships between different data entities. In 1970, Codd introduced the concept that users of a database should be ignorant of the &quot;inner workings&quot; of the database. Codd proposed the &quot;relational view&quot; of data which later evolved into the Relational Model which most databases use today. In 1971, the Database Task Report Group of CODASYL (the driving force behind the development of the programming language COBOL) first proposed a &quot;data description language for describing a database, a data description language for describing that part of the data base known to a program, and a data manipulation language.&quot; Most of the research and development of databases focused on the relational model during the 1970s.

In 1975, Bachman demonstrated how the relational model and the data structure set were similar and &quot;congruent&quot; ways of structuring data while working for Honeywell. The entity–relationship model was first proposed in its current form by Peter Chen in 1976 while he was conducting research at MIT. This model became the most frequently used model to describe relational databases. Chen was able to propose a model that was superior to the navigational model and was more applicable to the &quot;real world&quot; than the relational model proposed by Codd.

<text>Caradocus (&quot;middle Welsh&quot;: Karadawc), according to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia regum Britanniae&quot;, a pseudohistorical account of the kings of the Britons, was the duke of Cornwall under the reign of Octavius, who became king of Cornwall and died during the Emperor Magnus Maximus&#x27; reign.

Caradocus was the Duke of Cornwall during the reign of Octavius. It was he who suggested to Octavius that he should wed his daughter to Maximus and unite Britain with Rome through that union. When Octavius agreed to the idea, Caradocus sent out his son, Mauricius, to Rome as to deliver the message to Maximus. Conan Meriadoc, the king&#x27;s nephew, did not approve and nearly attacked Maximus when he landed near Southampton. Only when Caradocus arrived was peace restored. They dispersed and Octavius handed Maximus the kingship and retired, as Caradocus rallied behind Maximus.

Five years after Maximus became king of Britain, he left the country to ravage the land of Gaul, and Geoffrey of Monmouth says that Maximus had left governance of his kingdom to Caradocus&#x27; brother, Dionotus, whom he calls the king of Cornwall, &quot;who had succeeded his brother Caradoc in that kingdom.&quot; Geoffrey of Monmouth varies his use of the terms (&#x27;duke&#x27;) and (&#x27;king&#x27;) of Cornwall, even for the same person (for example, Cador), but his account consistently presents Caradocus as ruler of Cornwall under Octavius and then Maximus, who died within the first five years of the latter&#x27;s reign.

Cornish antiquary Richard Carew has Caradocus as Carodoc Duke of Cornwall, and gives an earlier source (D. Kay) who says that he was tasked by Octavius to found the University of Cambridge in 443. Carew has him succeeded by Gorlois in 500.

Welsh Triads mention Caradoc () as King Arthur&#x27;s chief elder at Celliwig in Cornwall, who may have served as Monmouth&#x27;s source for Caradocus.

<text>Janet Kim Albrechtsen (born 23 September 1966) is an Australian opinion columnist with &quot;The Australian.&quot; From 2005 until 2010, she was a member of the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Australia&#x27;s public broadcaster.

==Early life and education==
The daughter of Danish immigrants to Australia, Albrechtsen was born in Adelaide and attended Seacombe High School. She subsequently studied at University of Adelaide, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws with Honours. She subsequently attained a Doctor of Juridical Science from the University of Sydney. Her thesis was titled &quot;The regulation of the fundraising process in Australia: searching for an optimal mix between legislative prescriptions and market forces&quot;.

==Career==
Albrechtsen moved to Sydney to work as a commercial solicitor at Freehills. and taught at the University of Sydney Law School. Since turning to commentary, Albrechtsen has written for the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot;, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;Quadrant&quot;, Canada&#x27;s &quot;National Post&quot;, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal Asia&quot;.

Albrechtsen was a member of the Foreign Affairs Council from 2003 until 2007.

Albrechtsen was appointed to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 2005. She had previously derided the ABC as a &quot;Soviet-style workers collective&quot;. She told reporters in late 2009 that she was planning to retire from the board, and completed her five-year term on 18 February 2010 without seeking reappointment. In 2014 it was reported that Albrechtsen was appointed to an independent nomination panel that advises the Minister for Communications on the shortlisting of candidates for appointment to the ABC Board.

In 2008, Albrechtsen wrote a chapter for Peter van Onselen&#x27;s book &quot;The Liberals and Power&quot;. She argued the Liberals have become preoccupied with &quot;dominating the rational low ground&quot;, abandoning the high moral ground to the left. Norman Abjorensen said he appreciated her view of Howard&#x27;s legacy as not just a transformation of the Australian economy but also one of the Labor Party.

Albrechtsen conducted a lengthy interview series in 2014 with former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard, which aired as a featured story on Seven Network&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night&quot;, and again in January 2015 as its own five-part series on Sky News Australia entitled &quot;Howard Defined&quot;.

Albrechtsen was from 2014 until 2017 director and chair of the Audit, Finance and Risk Committee of the National Museum of Australia.

Janet Albrechtsen was appointed a director of the Institute of Public Affairs in 2016, and as chairman in July 2018, replacing Rod Kemp, a position held until November, 2019.

 she is an ambassador for the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation.

==Commentary==
Albrechtsen&#x27;s political views can be described as libertarian, as expressed by the Institute of Public Affairs. These views are based around the dignity of the individual, freedom from government control and individual responsibility. She writes about the fiscal responsibility by government and the people, issues relating to political correctness, identity politics and modern day &#x27;grievance feminism&#x27;, the growing censorship on campuses, freedom of speech and the role of civil society.

==Personal life==
Albrechtsen was married to lawyer John O&#x27;Sullivan, a friend of Malcolm Turnbull. They are now separated. The couple had three children, including Sascha O&#x27;Sullivan, who was also a journalist for &quot;The Australian&quot;.

<text>A sixteen-segment display (SISD) is a type of display based on sixteen segments that can be turned on or off to produce a graphic pattern. It is an extension of the more common seven-segment display, adding four diagonal and two vertical segments and splitting the three horizontal segments in half. Other variants include the fourteen-segment display which does not split the top or bottom horizontal segments, and the twenty-two-segment display that allows lower-case characters with descenders.

Often a character generator is used to translate 7-bit ASCII character codes to the 16 bits that indicate which of the 16 segments to turn on or off.

==Applications==
Sixteen-segment displays were originally designed to display alphanumeric characters (Latin letters and Arabic digits). Later they were used to display Thai numerals and Persian characters. Non-electronic displays using this pattern existed as early as 1902.

Before the advent of inexpensive dot-matrix displays, sixteen and fourteen-segment displays were used to produce alphanumeric characters on calculators and other embedded systems. Later they were used on videocassette recorders (VCR), DVD players, microwave ovens, car stereos, telephone Caller ID displays, and slot machines.

Sixteen-segment displays may be based on one of several technologies, the three most common optoelectronics types being LED, LCD and VFD. The LED variant is typically manufactured in single or dual character packages, to be combined as needed into text line displays of a suitable length for the application in question; they can also be stacked to build multiline displays.

As with seven and fourteen-segment displays, a decimal point and/or comma may be present as an additional segment, or pair of segments; the comma (used for triple-digit groupings or as a decimal separator in many regions) is commonly formed by combining the decimal point with a closely &#x27;attached&#x27; leftwards-descending arc-shaped segment. This way, a point or comma may be displayed between character positions instead of occupying a whole position by itself, which would be the case if employing the bottom middle vertical segment as a point and the bottom left diagonal segment as a comma. Such displays were very common on pinball machines for displaying the score and other information, before the widespread use of dot-matrix display panels.

<doc id="815777" wikidata="Q2315325" url="?curid=815777" title="Gender (stream)">
<text>The Gender () is a stream in the Dutch province of North Brabant. It originates in originally marshy flatlands near Steensel and flows through Veldhoven and its eastern district Meerveldhoven in a general east-northeast direction towards Eindhoven.

The Gender is one of many small streams that drain what once was the marshy heath and moorland of eastern North Brabant and the Kempen plateau. Similar streams include the Dommel, Kleine Dommel, Keersop, Tongelreep, Aa, Binnendieze and Run. All of these streams at one point or other merge to finally form River Dieze in Den Bosch, which in turn flows into River Maas.

Near Eindhoven, the Gender originally flowed just north of the medieval city walls, serving as the north part of the city moat, to end in confluence with the Dommel stream. As early as the fifteenth century, its course was diverted southward through the city centre, to provide the city with freshwater supplies and fire-extinguishing means. By the 19th century, the stretch within the old city had been filled in and the Gender now ended in De Vest, the city moat, which itself was connected to the Dommel.
Archaeological excavations during the 1980s and 1990s before the construction of a new shopping centre have brought several branches of the artificial inner-city section of the Gender to light, including a connection to the moat of Eindhoven Castle, which stood just east of the city walls.

 20th-century channelisation and the emergence of large-scale residential areas in the Gender basin have seen the last stretch before the city centre cut off. In order to regulate water levels of the Dommel and Gender streams, which occasionally threatened to flood Eindhoven&#x27;s inner city area, a drainage canal (Afwateringskanaal) was dug in the late 1930s to connect the Dommel to the newly constructed Beatrix Canal and so dispose of excess water. Into this canal the Gender now discharges. A further downstream section of the Gender between the canal and the Engelsbergen pond remains, but receives little water of the original stream. Two districts of Eindhoven that are situated on its banks were named after the Gender stream: Genderdal (&#x27;Gender Dale&#x27;) and Genderbeemd (&#x27;Gender Meadow&#x27;).

==Nieuwe Gender==
In 2005, proposals were accepted to have the Gender flow through the Eindhoven city centre once again: the Nieuwe Gender (&#x27;New Gender&#x27;) project. The stream is to flow partially underground, partially above-ground from the Engelsbergen pond through the city centre and discharge into the Dommel near the railway station. As of the summer of 2006, large-scale city centre reconstruction plans have included the implementation of the Nieuwe Gender, which is still in progress.

<doc id="815783" wikidata="Q1521567" url="?curid=815783" title="Omphalocele">
<text>An omphalocele or omphalocoele, also known as an exomphalos, is a rare abdominal wall defect. Beginning at the 6th week of development, rapid elongation of the gut and increased liver size reduces intra abdominal space, which pushes intestinal loops out of the abdominal cavity. Around 10th week, the intestine returns to the abdominal cavity and the process is completed by the 12th week. Persistence of intestine or the presence of other abdominal viscera (e.g. stomach, liver) in the umbilical cord results in an omphalocele.

Omphalocele occurs in 1 in 4,000 births and is associated with a high rate of mortality (25%) and severe malformations, such as cardiac anomalies (50%), neural tube defect (40%), exstrophy of the bladder and Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome. Approximately 15% of live-born infants with omphalocele have chromosomal abnormalities. About 30% of infants with an omphalocele have other congenital abnormalities.

==Signs and symptoms==
The sac, which is formed from an outpouching of the peritoneum, protrudes in the midline, through the umbilicus (navel).

It is normal for the intestines to protrude from the abdomen, into the umbilical cord, until about the tenth week of pregnancy, after which they return to inside the fetal abdomen. The omphalocele can be mild, with only a small loop of intestines present outside the abdomen, or severe, containing most of the abdominal organs. In severe cases surgical treatment is made more difficult because the infant&#x27;s abdomen is abnormally small, having had no need to expand to accommodate the developing organs.

Larger omphaloceles are associated with a higher risk of cardiac defects.
===Complications===
Complications may occur prenatally, during birth, management, treatment or after surgery. Both prenatally and during birth, the exomphalos can rupture. During birth there may be trauma to the liver for giant omphaloceles. During management exomphalos can act as a metabolic drain affecting nitrogen balance which can lead to failure to thrive, as well as hypothermia. Use of a non-absorbent patch during surgery can lead to wound sepsis post-surgery. Herniation from the patch is also a possibility. Intestinal dysfunction for a few weeks after the surgery is common, therefore parenteral feeding is continued post-surgery, however prolonged use of this may lead to hepatomegaly and cholestasis. If intestinal dysfunction persists it can lead to intestinal necrosis. Intestinal atresia can occur, which is where the mucosa and submucosa of the intestine form a web that obstructs the lumen which leads to malabsorption. Obstruction of the bowel can occur which results in short bowel syndrome. For the first few years of life there is a high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux which can be complicated by oesophagitis.

Post-surgery the umbilicus (navel) is deficient or abnormally placed that causes dislike amongst many patients. Umbilical reconstruction can be difficult due to scar tissue and lack of extra skin for surgical use, though this can be overcome by using tissue expanders below the skin and umbilicoplasty.

Ultimately, prognosis depends on the size of the defect and whether associated abnormalities are present or complications develop. Mortalities and morbidities still occur, with the mortality rate for large omphaloceles with associated abnormalities being higher. Most surviving omphalocele infants have no-long-term problems and grow up to be normal individuals.
==Causes==
Omphalocele is caused by malrotation of the bowels while returning to the abdomen during development. Some cases of omphalocele are believed to be due to an underlying genetic disorder, such as Edward&#x27;s syndrome (trisomy 18) or Patau syndrome (trisomy 13).

Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome is also associated with omphaloceles.

===Pathophysiology===
Exomphalos is caused by a failure of the ventral body wall to form and close the naturally occurring umbilical hernia that occurs during embryonic folding which is a process of embryogenesis. The normal process of embryogenesis is that at 2 weeks gestation the human embryo is a flat disc that consists of three layers, the outer ectoderm and inner endoderm separated by a middle layer called the mesoderm. The ectoderm gives rise to skin and the CNS, the mesoderm gives rise to muscle and the endoderm gives rise to organs. The focus areas for exomphalos are that the ectoderm will form the umbilical ring, the mesoderm will form the abdominal muscles and the endoderm will form the gut. After the disc becomes tri-layered, it undergoes growth and folding to transform it from disc to cylinder shaped. The layer of ectoderm and mesoderm in the dorsal axis grow ventrally to meet at the midline. Simultaneously, the cephalic (head) and caudal (tail) ends of these layers of the disc fold ventrally to meet the lateral folds in the center. The meeting of both axis at the center form the umbilical ring. Meanwhile, the endoderm migrates to the center of this cylinder.

By the fourth week of gestation the umbilical ring is formed. During the 6th week the midgut rapidly grows from the endoderm which causes a herniation of the gut through the umbilical ring. The gut rotates as it re-enters the abdominal cavity which allows for the small intestine and colon to migrate to their correct anatomical position by the end of the 10th week of development. This process fails to occur normally in cases of exomphalos, resulting in abdominal contents protruding from the umbilical ring.

Gut contents fail to return to the abdomen due to a fault in myogenesis (muscle formation and migration during embryogenesis). During embryogenesis the mesoderm that forms muscle divides into several somites that migrate dorso-ventrally towards the midline. The somites develop three parts that are sclerotome which will form bone, dermatome which will form skin of the back and myotome which will form muscle. The somites that remain close to the neural tube at the back of the body have epaxial myotome, whilst the somites that migrate to the midline have hypaxial myotome. The hypaxial myotome forms the abdominal muscles. The myotome cells will give rise to myoblasts (embryonic progenitor cells) which will align to form myotubules and then muscle fibers. Consequently, the myotome will become three muscle sheets that form the layers of abdominal wall muscles. The muscle of concern for exomphalos is the rectus abdominis. In the disease the muscle undergoes normal differentiation but fails to expand ventro-medially and narrow the umbilical ring which causes the natural umbilical hernia that occurs at 6 weeks of gestation to remain external to the body.

The location of the folding defect in the embryo determines the ultimate position of the exomphalos. A cephalic folding defect results in an epigastric exomphalos that is positioned high up on the abdomen which can be seen in the chromosomal defect pentalogy of Cantrell. Lateral folding defects result in a typical exomphalos that is positioned in the middle of the abdomen. A caudal folding defect results in a hypogastric exomphalos that is positioned on the lower abdomen.

===Genetics===
The genes that cause exomphalos are controversial and subject to research. Exomphalos is greatly associated with chromosomal defects and thus these are being explored to pinpoint the genetic cause of the disease. Studies in mice have indicated that mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 and 2 (Fgfr1, Fgfr2) cause exomphalos. Fibroblast growth factor (FBGF) encourages the migration of myotubules during myogenesis. When FBGF runs out myoblasts stop migrating, cease division and differentiate into myotubules that form muscle fibers. Mutations in homeobox genes such as Alx4, that direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development cause exomphalos in mice. Mutations in the Insulin like growth factor-2 gene (&quot;IGF2&quot;) and its associated receptor gene &quot;IGF2R&quot; cause high levels of IGF-2 protein in humans which leads to exomphalos in the associated disease Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). &quot;IFG2R&quot; is responsible for degradation of excess IGF-2 protein. BWS disease is caused by a mutation in chromosome 11 at the locus where the &quot;IGF2&quot; gene resides. Observance of the inheritance patterns of the associated anomalies through pedigrees show that exomphalos can be the result of autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked inheritance.

===Environmental factors===
It is not well known if actions of the mother could predispose or cause the disease. Alcohol use during the first trimester, heavy smoking, use of certain medications like the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and methimazole (anti-thyroid drug) during pregnancy, maternal febrile illness, IVF, parental consanguinity and obesity elevate the risk of a woman giving birth to a baby with exomphalos. Preventive methods that could be utilised by mothers include ingestion of a preconception multivitamin and supplementation with folic acid. Termination of pregnancy may be considered if a large exomphalos with associated congenital abnormalities is confirmed during prenatal diagnosis.

==Diagnosis==
===Related conditions===
Gastroschisis is a similar birth defect, but in gastroschisis the umbilical cord is not involved and the intestinal protrusion is usually to the right of the midline. Parts of organs may be free in the amniotic fluid and not enclosed in a membranous (peritoneal) sac. Gastroschisis is less frequently associated with other defects than omphalocele.

Omphaloceles occurs more frequently with increased maternal age. Other related syndromes are Shprintzen Goldberg, pentalogy of Cantrell, Beckwith–Wiedemann and OEIS complex (omphalocele, exstrophy of the cloaca, imperforate anus, spinal defects).

After surgery a child with omphalocele will have some degree of intestinal malrotation. Due to intestinal malrotation 4.4% of children with omphalocele will experience a midgut volvulus in the days, months, or years after surgery. Parents of children with omphalocele should seek immediate medical attention if their child displays signs and symptoms of an intestinal obstruction at any point in their childhood to avoid the possibility of bowel necrosis or death.

Some experts differentiate exomphalos and omphalocele as 2 related conditions, one worse than the other; in this sense, exomphalos involves a stronger covering of the hernia (with fascia and skin), whereas omphalocele involves a weaker covering of only a thin membrane. Others consider the terms synonymous names for any degree of herniation and covering.

==Screening==
An omphalocele is often detected through AFP screening or a detailed fetal ultrasound. Genetic counseling and genetic testing such as amniocentesis are usually offered during the pregnancy.

==Management==
There is no treatment that is required prenatally unless there is a rupture of the exomphalos within the mother. An intact exomphalos can be delivered safely vaginally and C-sections are also acceptable if obstetrical reasons require it. There appears to be no advantage for delivery by C-section unless it is for a giant exomphalos that contains most of the liver. In this case vaginal delivery may result in dystocia (inability of the baby to exit the pelvis during birth) and liver damage. Immediately after birth a nasogastric tube is required to decompress the intestines and an endotracheal intubation is needed to support respiration. The exomphalos sac is kept warm and covered with a moist saline gauze and plastic transparent bowel bag to prevent fluid loss. The neonate also requires fluid, vitamin K and antibiotic administration intravenously. After management strategies are applied, a baby with an intact sac is medically stable and does not require urgent surgery. This time is used to assess the newborn to rule out associated anomalies prior to surgical closure of the defect. Studies show there is no significant difference in survival between immediate or delayed closure.

Surgery can be performed directly for small omphaloceles, which will require a short stay in the nursery department, or in a staged manner for large omphaloceles, which will require several weeks stay. Staged closure requires a temporary artificial holding sac (a silo) to be placed over the abdominal organs and sutured to the abdominal wall. This can be made of non-adhesive dressing. The silo is gradually reduced in size at least once daily until all of the viscera have been returned to the abdominal cavity. This is repeated for several days to a week until surgical closure of the fascia/skin can be done. Closure may require a patch that can be rigid or non-rigid and made of natural biomaterials such as a bovine pericardium or artificial materials. The skin is then closed over the patch and it is re-vascularised by the body&#x27;s liver blood vessels post-surgery. The staged surgery is required, as rushed reduction of the exomphalos compromises venous return and ventilation, as it raises intra-abdominal pressure. In some cases, stretching of the abdominal wall to accommodate intestinal contents may be required.
Non-operative therapy uses escharotic ointments. This is used for infants with large omphaloceles that have been born prematurely with respiratory insufficiency and associated chromosomal defects, as they would not be able to tolerate surgery. The ointment causes the sac to granulate and epithelialize, which leaves a residual large ventral hernia, which can be repaired later with surgery when the baby is more stable. After surgery, for larger omphaloceles, mechanical ventilation and parenteral nutrition is needed to manage the baby.

==Society and culture==
===Awareness Day===
International Omphalocele Awareness Day is celebrated annually in the US on January 31, as part of Birth Defect Awareness Month. Several U.S. states have passed resolutions to officially recognize the date.

There is an Iron Age hill fort at Clifton Camp on Observatory Hill on the down, and there are remnants of an Iron Age or Roman field system between Ladies Mile and Bristol Zoo. The Roman road from Bath to Sea Mills crossed the Downs near Stoke Road, and a short length is visible as a slightly raised grassy bank. William Worcester described a presumably turf-cut figure of the giant Ghyst on Clifton Down in 1480.

In the Middle Ages Clifton Down was the commons of pasture for the manor of Clifton. It was also valuable farmland used by many farms in the area. In 1676 and 1686 the manor of Clifton was purchased by the Society of Merchant Venturers. During the 18th century Clifton became a fashionable summer spa, and Clifton Down was increasingly used for recreation. There were also lead mines in the 18th century, which account for the bumpy surface in the area by Upper Belgrave Road known as the Dumps. A gibbet was erected opposite the top end of Gallows Acre Lane (now known as Pembroke Road).

By the mid-19th century Clifton Down ceased to be used for grazing. Clifton became a desirable place to live, and large houses were built close to Clifton Down. Bristol Corporation became concerned at the threat to this public amenity, and in 1861 promoted an Act of Parliament, under which the Society of Merchant Venturers undertook to secure Clifton Down for public enjoyment free of charge.

Since 1861 Clifton Down has been managed, with Durdham Down, by the Downs Committee, a joint committee of the Society of Merchant Venturers and Bristol City Council, which owns Durdham Down. The committee appoints a Downs Ranger to oversee the Downs.

==Suffragette meeting==
On 20 September 1908 there was a meeting across the road near the water tower to support the Suffragette movement: some 10,000 people were there.

==World War II==
Stone cairns were placed on all open spaces to deter landings of enemy aircraft: the cairns were removed in 1944. In May 1941, 32 acres were requisitioned on the east side of Ladies Mile to store military vehicles in six canvas hangars. There was a tank repair area near the Sea Walls. An area of 42 acres to the west of Ladies Mile was used from February 1944 to store heavy army equipment.

==Features==
Near Clifton village is the site of the Observatory, a small tower with a camera obscura at the top. Located close to the observatory is an open face of rock that has been used as a slide by generations of Bristolians and students. This &quot;rock slide&quot; has become polished and is now an attraction to visitors.

A railway tunnel, Clifton Down Tunnel, passes underneath Clifton on the line from Temple Meads to Severn Beach. One portal is in Clifton near Clifton Down railway station; the other in the Avon Gorge far below Clifton Down. There are three air shafts for the tunnel: two in vertical tower form (near the zoo, and in Walcombe Slade gulley) with the third being a horizontal tunnel on the Portway.

Part of Clifton Down was used by gay men as a cruising ground. In 2008, there were concerns by some gay men at the removal of vegetation as part of the Avon Gorge Management Plan, on the grounds that this was discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.

<text>Durdham Down is an area of public open space in Bristol, England. With its neighbour Clifton Down to the southwest, it constitutes a area known as The Downs, much used for leisure including walking, jogging and team sports. Its exposed position makes it particularly suitable for kite flying.

== History ==

Durdham Down was long used as grazing land, since its thin soils made it unsuitable for arable land or woodland. An Anglo-Saxon charter of 883 grants grazing rights over part of Durdham Down. The down was the commons of pasture for the manor of Henbury during the Middle Ages. The land was also valuable farmland used by many farms in the area. In 1643 and 1645, during the English Civil War, Royalist and Parliamentarian armies assembled on the down.

In 1857, concerned by Victorian-built houses encroaching on the open space as the city expanded, the Bristol Corporation acquired commoners&#x27; rights on the downs, and exercised them the following year by grazing sheep. In 1861 Durdham Down itself was bought by the City from the Lords of the Manor of Henbury for £15,000 via an Act of Parliament. Grazing on the down declined during the 19th century, and finally ceased in 1925.

Since 1861 Durdham Down has been managed, with Clifton Down, by the Downs Committee, a joint committee of the corporation and the Society of Merchant Venturers, which owns Clifton Down. The committee appoints a Downs Ranger to oversee the Downs.

In November 1910 a Bristol Boxkite, which had been recently built by the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company&#x27;s factory at the nearby village of Filton, landed on Durdham Down. During the course of that afternoon, the French pilot, M. Maurice Tetard, undertook several demonstration flights from this temporary airfield. Bristolians in large numbers flocked to The Downs to see this new-fangled flying machine.

A blue plaque on the public toilets by the water tower on Stoke Road commemorates Victoria Hughes, the toilet attendant from 1929 to 1962, who also looked after sex workers in the area. In 1977, aged 80, Hughes published her memoirs as &quot;Ladies&#x27; Mile&quot;.

== Features ==

The Down features clumps of scrubby hawthorns, the avenues of massive horse-chestnuts, the flat swathes of grass and the elegant bordering of Victorian houses.

The White Tree roundabout is a road junction on Durdham Down. The roundabout was constructed in the 1950s, but the name appears to date back to the 19th century. For a short period in 1908, the White Tree was the terminus of the tram, before it was extended to Westbury. There have been several white trees at the junction, either a silver birch or a tree with a trunk painted white. One white tree was demolished to make way for the roundabout. Another white tree was cut down during the 1970s outbreak of Dutch elm disease.

The &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; are a group of pine trees on Durdham Down. A number of the trees have been lost over the years - notably in the 1990 Burns&#x27; Day storm - leaving three survivors. Replacement trees in the group have been vandalised, so an entirely new group of seven has been planted nearby.

== Sports ==

The preamble to the 1861 Act noted that the Downs had &#x27;been used as a place of public resort and recreation since time immemorial&#x27; and the intent was to safeguard this use. During the 19th century horse-races were held, especially at Easter, as well as wrestling and boxing contests and cricket matches. Other activities included donkey rides, bands, flower shows, circuses, public meetings and prostitution. Nowadays the sporting tradition carries on with the Bristol Downs Football League playing on permanently laid out pitches.

The Gloucestershire County Cricket Club played its initial first-class match, which was against Surrey CCC, at Durdham Down on 2, 3 and 4 June 1870.

<doc id="815788" wikidata="Q2672554" url="?curid=815788" title="Dionotus">
<text>Dionotus was a legendary king of Cornwall in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia regum Britanniae&quot;, an account of the rulers of Britain based on ancient Welsh sources and disputed by many historians. Dionotus succeeding his brother Caradocus, and was regent of Britain during the campaigns in Gaul of Emperor Magnus Maximus. The curious thing about this king is that the Welsh chronicles, which parallel most of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s book, do not mention this king by name. However, Geoffrey uses Latin versions of Welsh names so he could be referring to Dynod, duke of Cornwall, or Anwn Dynod, Maximus&#x27;s own son.

Nothing is said of Dionotus until he became king under Maximus. He is first mentioned when Conan Meriadoc, king of Brittany sends a request to Britain for Briton women to help populate his country. Dionotus, being extremely noble and powerful, accepted the request and sent seventy-two thousand women to Gaul. The ships, however, became lost at sea and most of the women died or were captured by barbarians.

No further mention is made of Dionotus by Geoffrey of Monmouth, but a small group of these women defied kings Wanius and Melga of the Picts and the Huns, who attempted to have intercourse with them. The women were slaughtered for their defiance and the kings invaded Britain from Albany. Britain, due to the war led by Maximus and the tragedy at sea, was empty of all able-bodied men and women. This allowed the two kings room to destroy much of the countryside before any attempt at resisting them could be made.

Maximus finally sent a man named Gracianus Municeps to stop the attack by the kings. He was sent in with two legions and killed many thousands of warriors before the kings fled off the island to Ireland. Maximus died in Rome soon after, and while no mention is made of Dionotus or his fate, Gracianus took hold of the crown.

A passing mention is made in the &quot;Historia regum Britanniae&quot; to Conan Meriadoc being madly in love with his daughter, Ursula, which reflects the ninth century legend of Saint Ursula. According to the legend, Dionotus (her father, said to be king of Dumnonia) is asked her hand in marriage by Conan Meriadoc, the pagan governor of Armorica. After obtaining a three-year delay, she was given as companions ten young women, each of which had a thousand virgin handmaidens; they embarked in eleven ships and sailed for three years, but when the time came for her marriage, the ships were miraculously carried by a gale first to Cologne, then Basel and on to Rome before returning to Cologne where they were killed by Huns.

As well as this source, Geoffrey may also have based this character on the historical figure of Marcus, a short lived Roman usurper whose limited historical exploits are seemingly mirrored by Dionotus&#x27;.

<text>The Downs are an area of public open limestone downland in Bristol, England. They consist of Durdham Down to the north and east and Clifton Down to the south. They are used for leisure, walking, team sports and sightseeing (especially at the Avon Gorge cliff edge). 

A grey concrete water tower of 1954 stands on the Downs near the top of Blackboy Hill, with a long, low, covered reservoir alongside it.

==Durdham Down==

Durdham Down is the north and east part of the Downs, extending to Westbury Park and Henleaze, with an area of . It is owned by Bristol City Council for the benefit of the people of Bristol.

==Clifton Down==

Clifton Down is the southern part of the Downs, next to Clifton and extending to the edge of the Avon Gorge, with an area of . It is owned by the Society of Merchant Venturers.

==Management==
Since an Act of Parliament in 1861, when Bristol Corporation acquired Durdham Down, the Downs have been managed as a single unit by the Downs Committee, a joint committee of the corporation and the Merchant Venturers. They have been designated common land since the early 1970s by Bristol City Council.

== Events ==
There are permanent football pitches, used by the Bristol Downs Football League. There are also temporary attractions on the Downs, such as circuses and (until 2006) the annual Bristol Flower Show. Since 2016 it has been the site of The Downs Festival, an annual music festival with both local and nationally known bands attending.

In 1982 6,000 people assembled on the Downs in response to a local newspaper advertisement placed by the makers of the new breakfast television show TV-am. The 6,000 people were used to make the words &#x27;Good&#x27;, &#x27;Morning&#x27; and &#x27;Britain&#x27;, used for the opening titles of the show. It took 2 hours to get them into place and another 2 hours to shoot.

==In popular culture==
The Downs played a significant role in Jack Thorne&#x27;s 2018 Channel 4 mini-series &quot;Kiri&quot;.

<doc id="815795" wikidata="Q7831283" url="?curid=815795" title="Tracey Wigginton">
<text>Tracey Avril Wigginton (born 4 August 1965), known as the &quot;Lesbian Vampire Killer&quot;, is an Australian murderer who achieved notoriety for killing Edward Baldock in 1989, supposedly to drink his blood. This was described as &quot;one of the most brutal and bizarre crimes Australia has ever seen.&quot; Wigginton was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1991, and was paroled in 2012.

==Early life==
Wigginton grew up in the northern Australian coastal city of Rockhampton. She was adopted at the age of three by her wealthy maternal grandparents, George and Avril Wigginton, after her mother could no longer care for her following a divorce. Wigginton claims that her grandparents were controlling, and had physically and sexually abused her.

In 1981, Wigginton&#x27;s grandparents died and left 15 year-old Wigginton $75,000 ($310,640 in 2022 dollars). Wigginton briefly moved back in with her mother, who was not accepting of her lesbianism, and then moved in with a family friend who described her as &quot;a loving girl, gifted artist and devout Catholic.&quot;

Following a miscarriage, Wigginton stopped attending Mass, and started communicating with a white witch in Adelaide. Following a move to Brisbane, Wigginton began to immerse herself in the occult: keeping black magic items on her person, and using blood from animals to draw occult symbols.

== Murder ==
Wigginton, who allegedly killed and drank the blood of animals, had been planning for some time to escalate to murdering a man so that she could &quot;feed&quot; on him. On the night of the murder, Wigginton (then aged 24), Lisa Ptaschinski (aged 24), Kim Jervis (aged 23) and Tracy Waugh (aged 23) had been out drinking and then drove around in Wigginton&#x27;s Holden Commodore in search of a victim. At the time, Wigginton stood 183cm (6 feet) tall and weighed 95kg (209 pounds).

Edward Baldock (47), a council worker and father of four, was waiting for a taxi after drinking heavily and playing darts with friends. Jervis persuaded him into their car and they drove him to a park on the banks of the Brisbane River. It is disputed whether Wigginton got Baldock in the car by offering him a lift or by pretending to be a sex worker. There, he undressed while Wigginton returned to the car to retrieve a knife. She then stabbed him 27 times, nearly severing his head before drinking his blood.

When police arrived at the scene, they located Wigginton&#x27;s bank card in one of Baldock&#x27;s shoes among his neatly folded pile of clothes. The four women were then quickly arrested. A few days after the murder, Wigginton told police that she ‘felt nothing’ while stabbing Baldock and that she sat down to smoke a cigarette while she watched him die.

==Trial==
Wigginton was the only one of the four co-accused who pleaded guilty to the charge of murder. Therefore, there was no trial for her and few details were disclosed to the court as to why this incident occurred by Wigginton; Ptaschinski, Jervis, and Waugh stated that Wigginton had claimed to have vampiric tendencies. They said that the reason for the murder was to enable the drinking of the man&#x27;s blood. During the trial, Wigginton said to the media &quot;‘It&#x27;s hard to be famous, isn&#x27;t it? A legend in my own mind’.&quot;

In 1991, a jury convicted Wigginton of murder and she was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Supreme Court of Queensland with a minimum of 13 years. Ptaschinski was also convicted of murder, and Jervis of manslaughter. Waugh was acquitted.

==Aftermath==
In 2006, Wigginton assaulted a fellow inmate and a prison guard.

The case still commands strong media interest and public reaction. In April 2008, it was reported that Wigginton was being released. However, it was actually Ptaschinski who was being released under the resettlement leave program, given a maximum of 12 hours leave every two months for six months.

Wigginton made four unsuccessful parole applications until 2011 when the parole board granted her application. Wigginton was released from prison on 11 January 2012 despite lying to the parole board.

In 2021, interest in Wigginton was revived when it was revealed that she was posting images on Facebook of vampires, witches, and a pile of skull and bones. Following this, the officers who investigated the case said that Wigginton&#x27;s parole should be revoked.

<text>[[File:Bump.png|thumb|350x350px|The graph of the bump function formula_1 where formula_2 and formula_3
which is not an infinitely [[differentiable function]] (so, is not &quot;smooth&quot;), so the constraints must be strictly fulfilled.

Some interesting facts about the function:
:formula_4
Are that formula_5 make smooth transition curves with &quot;almost&quot; constant slope edges (a bump function with true straight slopes is portrayed this [[Delay differential equation|Another example]]).

A proper example of a smooth Bump function would be:
:formula_6

A proper example of a smooth transition function will be:
:formula_7

where could be noticed that it can be represented also through [[Hyperbolic functions]]:

:formula_8

==Existence of bump functions==
It is possible to construct bump functions &quot;to specifications&quot;. Stated formally, if formula_9 is an arbitrary [[compact set]] in formula_10 dimensions and formula_11 is an [[open set]] containing formula_12 there exists a bump function formula_13 which is formula_14 on formula_9 and formula_16 outside of formula_17 Since formula_11 can be taken to be a very small neighborhood of formula_12 this amounts to being able to construct a function that is formula_14 on formula_9 and falls off rapidly to formula_16 outside of formula_12 while still being smooth.

Bump functions defined in terms of convolution

The construction proceeds as follows. One considers a compact neighborhood formula_24 of formula_9 contained in formula_26 so formula_27 The [[indicator function|characteristic function]] formula_28 of formula_24 will be equal to formula_14 on formula_24 and formula_16 outside of formula_33 so in particular, it will be formula_14 on formula_9 and formula_16 outside of formula_17 This function is not smooth however. The key idea is to smooth formula_28 a bit, by taking the [[convolution]] of formula_28 with a [[mollifier]]. The latter is just a bump function with a very small support and whose integral is formula_40 Such a mollifier can be obtained, for example, by taking the bump function formula_41 from the previous section and performing appropriate scalings.

Bump functions defined in terms of a function formula_42 with support formula_43

An alternative construction that does not involve convolution is now detailed. 
It begins by constructing a smooth function formula_44 that is positive on a given open subset formula_45 and vanishes off of formula_17 This function&#x27;s support is equal to the closure formula_47 of formula_11 in formula_49 so if formula_47 is compact, then formula_51 is a bump function. 

Start with any smooth function formula_52 that vanishes on the negative reals and is positive on the positive reals (that is, formula_53 on formula_54 and formula_55 on formula_56 where continuity from the left necessitates formula_57); an example of such a function is formula_58 for formula_59 and formula_60 otherwise. 
Fix an open subset formula_11 of formula_62 and denote the usual [[Euclidean norm]] by formula_63 (so formula_62 is endowed with the usual [[Euclidean metric]]). 
The following construction defines a smooth function formula_44 that is positive on formula_11 and vanishes outside of formula_17 So in particular, if formula_11 is relatively compact then this function formula_51 will be a bump function.

If formula_70 then let formula_71 while if formula_72 then let formula_73; so assume formula_11 is neither of these. Let formula_75 be an [[Cover (topology)|open cover]] of formula_11 by open balls where the open ball formula_77 has radius formula_78 and center formula_79 Then the map formula_80 defined by formula_81 is a smooth function that is positive on formula_77 and vanishes off of formula_83 
For every formula_84 let
formula_85
where this [[supremum]] is not equal to formula_86 (so formula_87 is a non-negative real number) because formula_88 the partial derivatives all vanish (equal formula_16) at any formula_90 outside of formula_91 while on the compact set formula_92 the values of each of the (finitely many) partial derivatives are (uniformly) bounded above by some non-negative real number. 
The series 
formula_93
converges uniformly on formula_62 to a smooth function formula_44 that is positive on formula_11 and vanishes off of formula_17 
Moreover, for any non-negative integers formula_98
formula_99
where this series also converges uniformly on formula_62 (because whenever formula_101 then the formula_102th term&#x27;s absolute value is formula_103). This completes the construction. 

As a corollary, given two disjoint closed subsets formula_104 of formula_49 the above construction guarantees the existence of smooth non-negative functions formula_106 such that for any formula_107 formula_108 if and only if formula_109 and similarly, formula_110 if and only if formula_111 then the function 
formula_112 
is smooth and for any formula_107 formula_114 if and only if formula_109 formula_116 if and only if formula_111 and formula_118 if and only if formula_119 
In particular, formula_120 if and only if formula_121 so if in addition formula_122 is relatively compact in formula_62 (where formula_124 implies formula_125) then formula_126 will be a smooth bump function with support in formula_127

==Properties and uses==

While bump functions are smooth, the [[identity theorem]] prohibits their being [[analytic function|analytic]] unless they [[Zero of a function|vanish]] identically. Bump functions are often used as [[mollifier]]s, as smooth [[cutoff function]]s, and to form smooth [[partitions of unity]]. They are the most common class of [[test functions]] used in analysis. The space of bump functions is closed under many operations. For instance, the sum, product, or [[convolution]] of two bump functions is again a bump function, and any [[differential operator]] with smooth coefficients, when applied to a bump function, will produce another bump function.

If the boundaries of the Bump function domain is formula_128 to fulfill the requirement of &quot;smoothness&quot;, it has to preserve the continuity of all its derivatives, which leads to the following requirement at the boundaries of its domain:
formula_129

The [[Fourier transform]] of a bump function is a (real) analytic function, and it can be extended to the whole [[complex plane]]: hence it cannot be compactly supported unless it is zero, since the only entire analytic bump function is the zero function (see [[Paley–Wiener theorem]] and [[Liouville&#x27;s theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville&#x27;s theorem]]). Because the bump function is infinitely differentiable, its Fourier transform must decay faster than any finite power of formula_130 for a large angular frequency formula_131 The Fourier transform of the particular bump function
formula_132
for large formula_131

<text>The II Corps was an army corps of the British Army formed in both the First World War and the Second World War. There had also been a short-lived II Corps during the Waterloo Campaign.

==Napoleonic precursor==
Assembling an army in the Southern Netherlands to fight Napoleon&#x27;s resurgent forces in the spring of 1815, the Duke of Wellington formed it into army corps, deliberately mixing units from the Anglo-Hanoverian, Dutch and German contingents so that the weaker elements would be stiffened by more experienced or reliable troops. As he put it: &quot;It was necessary to organize these troops in brigades, divisions, and corps d’armee with those better disciplined and more accustomed to war&quot;. He placed II Corps under the command of Lord Hill. However, Wellington did not use the corps as tactical entities, and continued his accustomed practice of issuing orders directly to divisional and lower commanders. When he drew up his army on the ridge at Waterloo, elements of the various corps were mixed up, and although he gave Hill command of the left wing, this included elements of I Corps. Subsequent to the battle, the corps structure was re-established for the advance into France, and Wellington issued orders through Hill and the other corps commanders.

===Order of battle===
GOC: Lieut-Gen Lord Hill

*2nd (British) Division (Anglo-Hanoverian)
*4th (British) Division (Anglo-Hanoverian)
*1st (Netherlands) Division (Dutch)
*Netherlands Indian Contingent

==Before the First World War==
After the Waterloo campaign the army corps structure disappeared from the British Army for a century, except for ad hoc corps assembled during annual manoeuvres (e.g. Army Manoeuvres of 1913). In 1876 a mobilization scheme for eight army corps was published, with &#x27;Second Corps&#x27; based at Aldershot and composed of regular and militia troops. In 1880 its organization was:

*1st Division (Aldershot)
**1st Brigade (Aldershot)
***2nd Bn. 19th Foot (Aldershot), 41st Foot (Aldershot), 45th Foot (Aldershot)
**2nd Brigade (Aldershot)

**A/1st Brigade RA (Devonport), A/6th Brigade RA (Woolwich)

**15th Company Royal Engineers and Field Park (Kensington)

This scheme had been dropped by 1881. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1891 (drawn up by Edward Stanhope when secretary of state for war) laid down the policy that after providing for garrisons and India, the army should be able to mobilise three army corps for home defence, two of regular troops and one partly of militia, of three divisions each. Only after those commitments, it was hoped, two army corps might be organised for the unlikely eventuality of deployment abroad. The 1901 Army Estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands, of which only I Corps (Aldershot Command and II Corps (Southern Command on Salisbury Plain) would be entirely formed of regular troops. However, these arrangements remained theoretical. The Haldane Reforms of 1907 established a six-division British Expeditionary Force (BEF) for deployment overseas, which did not envisage any intermediate headquarters between GHQ and the infantry divisions.

==First World War==
On mobilisation in August 1914 it was decided that the BEF would have two-division army corps like the French armies with which the BEF was to operate but only one corps HQ existed, two were improvised. II Corps proceeded to France in August 1914 under the command of Sir James Grierson but Grierson died suddenly on the train to the front on 17 August. Sir John French (GOCinC BEF) wanted Sir Herbert Plumer to succeed Grierson, but the secretary of state for war, Earl Kitchener, instead chose Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, transferred from Southern Command. Smith-Dorrien caught up with his HQ at Bavai on 21 August. II Corps was first engaged two days later at the Battle of Mons and forced into the Great Retreat with the rest of the BEF. It later fought a delaying action against Alexander von Kluck&#x27;s German First Army in the Battle of Le Cateau which allowed most of its surviving forces to escape. It remained on the Western Front throughout the war. It was forced into retreat, with the soldiers exhaust

*36th (Ulster) Division.

==Second World War==
On the outbreak of the Second World War, II Corps was mobilised at Salisbury with two unprepared infantry divisions, under the command of Lieut-General Sir Alan Brooke from Southern Command. II Corps&#x27; insignia, designed by its Chief of Staff, Vyvyan Pope, was a visual pun on the name of its commander, who was also a keen fisherman: it depicted a red leaping salmon upon three wavy blue bands against a white background, all in an oblong red border. The corps crossed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) at the end of September 1939 and at once moved up to the Belgium–France border. It took part in the advance into Belgium to resist the German invasion, and was then pushed back with the rest of the BEF to Dunkirk during the Battle of France. During the retreat, II Corps covered the vulnerable left flank of the BEF. On 29 May 1940, Brooke was ordered back to Britain to form a new force, and he handed over temporary command of II Corps to Maj-Gen Bernard Montgomery of 3rd Division. Under Montgomery, II Corps was evacuated from Dunkirk in June 1940.

===Deception plans===

After commanding forces in the United Kingdom, from Lower Hare Park near Newmarket within Eastern Command, II Corps was being disbanded in early 1944 when selected to be one of the two corps comprising the notional British Fourth Army, which under the deception plan Fortitude North was supposed to attack Norway.

For this operation II Corps was supposedly headquartered at Stirling in Scotland, and notionally consisted of the genuine 3rd Infantry Division (shortly replaced by the notional 58th Infantry Division), the genuine 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division in Northern Ireland, and the genuine 113th Independent Infantry Brigade in Orkney. Under Fortitude North II Corps was supposedly to attack Stavanger, with the 3rd Division (later the 58th) and supporting commandos and paratroops seizing the airfields, the 55th (West Lancashire) Division joining as followup; the genuine U.S. XV Corps from Northern Ireland would augment the force, which would advance on Oslo.

The corps was transferred to First United States Army Group (FUSAG) in early June 1944 and moved to Lincolnshire; restored to Fourth Army when that formation joined FUSAG for Fortitude South II, headquarters now at Tunbridge Wells in Kent, with under command the British 55th and 58th divisions and the British 35th Armoured Brigade. It was notionally transferred to France in late September, consisting of the essentially notional 55th Division, the genuine 79th Armoured Division, and the notional 76th Infantry Division; also apparently at times the genuine 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, disbanded but notionally kept alive. It was notionally part of First Canadian Army in the deception Operation Trolleycar II (threatening an attack on the Germans in the Netherlands) in November 1944.

==Post Second World War==
After the Second World War, as a genuine corps it was based in the Middle East, controlling British forces around the Suez Canal. Following the British withdrawal from Egypt, II Corps was also the controlling force for the invasion of the country during the Suez Crisis, seemingly controlling 3rd Infantry Division, under Major-General J.B. (Jack) Churcher, and 16th Parachute Brigade as well as 10th Armoured Division and 3 Commando Brigade.

Lieutenant-General Hugh Stockwell commanded the corps during &#x27;Musketeer.&#x27; On 31 July 1956 Stockwell, then commanding I Corps in Germany, received a message from the War Office telling him to meet General Sir William Oliver, Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who flew to Germany to collect Stockwell so that he could be briefed by General Sir Gerald Templer, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, back in London. Briefing Stockwell personally, Templer told him to hand over command of I Corps, but to take sufficient men from the corps staff as he would need to create another headquarters, II Corps, which was to &quot;establish a planning cell in London as quickly as possible.&quot; Led by Kenneth Darling as Brigader, General Staff, this group was dispatched to London from West Germany on 4 August to begin setting up the corps headquarters and begin the initial planning. They were installed the next day, Bank Holiday Monday, in the old underground wartime HQ under the Thames, the Montagu House Annex of the War Office. But as the planning continued Stockwell and his new headquarters were not controlling the formations which were to be involved: those in the Middle East and Cyprus were under GHQ Middle East Land Forces, while those in the UK and Germany were directed for these purposes by the War Office through either Home commands or the British Army of the Rhine.

After the invasion had ended and the United Nations Emergency Force was arriving under the Canadian Army general E. L. M. Burns, Stockwell returned to the UK, where II Corps was disbanded by being reintegrated back into I Corps.

<doc id="815803" wikidata="Q5557038" url="?curid=815803" title="Ghost (game)">
<text>Ghost (also known as ghosts or pig) is a written or spoken word game in which players take turns to extend the letters of a word without completing a valid word.

Ghost can be played by two or more players and requires no equipment, although it can be played with pencil and paper instead of being spoken aloud.

==Rules==

Players take turns to call a letter, adding those letters to a shared, growing word fragment. (For example, if the first player calls &quot;T&quot;, the second might call &quot;R&quot; to make &quot;TR&quot;.)

Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual word.

The player whose turn it is may — instead of adding a letter — challenge the previous player to prove that the current fragment is actually the beginning of a word. If the challenged player can name such a word, the challenger loses the round; otherwise the challenged player loses the round. If a player bluffs, or completes a word without other players noticing, then play continues. 

If a complete word is formed in this way, the player who called the final letter of it loses the round. (Usually some minimum is set on the length of a word that counts, such as three or four letters.) The losing player earns a &quot;letter&quot; (as in the basketball game horse), with players being eliminated when they have been given all five letters of the word &quot;ghost&quot;.

When a round ends, play generally passes to the left.

==Winning strategy==
Since the game tree of Ghost can be derived from the list of combinations of letters that are considered to be words, the game (as played by two players) can be easily &quot;solved&quot; to find a winning strategy for one player.

Alan Frank, a member of the National Puzzlers&#x27; League, constructed a sample winning strategy in 1987, based on the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary. Randall Munroe posted a sample winning strategy in 2007 on the news page of his webcomic, xkcd. He based his solution on the Ubuntu dictionary.

==Variants==
===Superghost===
Superghost is played by choosing either the beginning or end of the growing word fragment and adding a letter there. For example, given the fragment ERA, a player might offer BERA or ERAD. This version was played by James Thurber and his circle of friends.

This is also known as Fore-and-Aft in &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Rules of Games,&quot; Lexicant, or Llano.

===Superduperghost===

This is played by deciding whether to reverse the letters of the word fragment before adding a letter to the fragment&#x27;s beginning or end. For example, given the fragment ERA, a player might offer BERA, ERAD, NARE, or AREN. This variant was first broadly adopted at the 1978 World Science Fiction Convention in Phoenix, Arizona (IguanaCon) and is credited to Cary Hammer and Mark Malamud.

===Xghost===
This is played by adding a letter anywhere in the growing word fragment, including between letters. For example, given the fragment ERA, a player might offer BERA, ERAD, EBRA, or ERMA.

This version was invented by Daniel Asimov around 1970. Originally and still often known as &quot;Superduperghost&quot;, it was played by his circle of mathematics grad student friends at U.C. Berkeley.

This variant is also sometimes known as Llama.

===Anaghost===
This version allows the player to rearrange (&quot;ana&quot;gram) the letters in addition to adding one. For example, given the fragment ERA, a player might offer EART, EBAR, or NREA.

===Spook===
Spook is played by adding letters to a &quot;pool&quot; in which no fixed order is assumed. In this game, one&#x27;s objective is to avoid completing a letter pool which can be ordered to form a word. For example, given the pool {A,B,F,L,S,U}, a player would be unwise to add H, which would form the word BASHFUL. However, they might add B, and cite the word FLASHBULB if challenged.

These variants usually require much more effort and time to play than the conventional game, and as such are lesser-known and less popular.

===Cheddar Gorge===
Cheddar Gorge is played by adding a &quot;word&quot; to the end of a growing &quot;sentence&quot; fragment, and avoiding the completion of a sentence. This variant was popularized on the BBC Radio show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

==History==

The name &quot;ghost&quot; is shortened from the original name &quot;three thirds of a ghost&quot;; a player, upon losing, became one, two, and finally three &quot;thirds of a ghost&quot;, at which point they would float away and be out of the game.

==Computational complexity==

Given a regular expression R, if two players take turns playing Ghost with the language generated by R, the problem of determining whether player 1 has a winning strategy is in EXPSPACE, and is PSPACE-hard.
It&#x27;s proved to be PSPACE-hard by reducing Generalized Geography, a problem known to be PSPACE-hard, to a game of Ghost. Specifically, given a Generalized Geography graph, a nondeterministic finite automaton can be constructed, which gives a regular expression R, such that player 1 has a winning strategy in Ghost with R if and only if they have a winning strategy in the Generalized Geography game.

This proof extends to Superghost, Superduperghost, Xghost, played on regular languages generated by regular expressions. Thus Superghost, Superduperghost, Xghost played on regular languages are all PSPACE-hard and in EXPSPACE. Spook on regular language is PSPACE-hard, but it&#x27;s unknown if it&#x27;s in EXPSPACE.

===In German===

In German, words can be formed quite freely by concatenation. Because of this, one can write a regular expression that generates a regular language L, such that every word in L is technically a word (which might be nonsensical) in German. A game of ghost played on such languages L is called German ghost. This variant was also shown to be PSPACE-hard.

<text>III Corps was an army corps of the British Army formed in both the First World War and the Second World War.

==Prior to the First World War==

In 1876, a mobilisation scheme for eight army corps was published, with &#x27;3rd Corps&#x27; headquartered at Croydon and composed of the guards regiments. In 1880 its order of battle was:
*1st Division (Croydon)
**1st Brigade (London)
***1st Bn. Grenadier Guards (Wellington Barracks), 2nd Bn. Coldstream Guards (The Tower), 2nd Bn. Scots Guards (Chelsea)
**2nd Brigade (Croydon)
***3rd Bn. Grenadier Guards (Chelsea), 1st Bn. Coldstream Guards (Shorncliffe), 1st Bn. Scots Guards (Wellington Barracks)
**Divisional Troops
***1st Bn. 60th Foot (Winchester), Staffordshire Yeomanry (Lichfield), 9th Company Royal Engineers (RE) (Chatham)
**Artillery
***C/5th Brigade Royal Artillery(RA) (Ipswich), B/5th Brigade RA (Chatham), B/6th Brigade RA (Woolwich)
*2nd Division (Red Hill)
**1st Brigade (Red Hill)
***Kilkenny Militia (Kilkenny), King&#x27;s County Militia (Parsonstown), Limerick County Militia (Limerick)
**2nd Brigade (Red Hill)
***1st Royal Surrey Militia (Richmond upon Thames), 2nd Royal Surrey Militia (Guildford), 3rd Royal Surrey Militia (Kingston upon Thames)
**Divisional Troops
***Royal Tyrone Fusiliers Militia (Omagh), Warwickshire Yeomanry (Warwick)
**Artillery
***L/3rd Brigade RA (Hilsea), L/4th Brigade RA (Hilsea), C/6th Brigade RA (Woolwich)
*3rd Division (Tunbridge Wells)
**1st Brigade (Tunbridge Wells)
***West Kent Light Infantry Militia (Maidstone), 4th South Middlesex Militia (Hounslow), Royal London Militia (London)
**2nd Brigade (Maidstone)
***1st Royal East Middlesex Militia (Hounslow), 2nd Royal West Middlesex Militia (Barnet), 3rd Royal Westminster Middlesex Militia (Turnham Green)
**Divisional Troops
***Royal Sussex Light Infantry Militia (Chichester), Leicestershire Yeomanry (Leicester)
**Artillery
***B/1st Brigade RA (Shorncliffe), C/1st Brigade RA (Shorncliffe)
*Cavalry Brigade (Ashford)
**1st Life Guards (London), 2nd Life Guards (Windsor), Royal Horse Guards (London), East Kent Yeomanry (Canterbury), K Battery B Brigade RHA (Canterbury)
*Corps Artillery (Croydon)
**K Battery A Brigade Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) (Exeter), F Battery B Brigade RHA (Exeter)

This scheme had been dropped by 1881. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1891 (drawn up by Edward Stanhope when Secretary of State for War) laid down the policy that after providing for garrisons and India, the army should be able to mobilise three army corps for home defence, two of regular troops and one partly of militia, each of three divisions. The 1901 army estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands (Aldershot, Southern, Irish, Eastern, Northern and Scottish). From 1 October 1901, the Duke of Connaught held the dual commands of CinC Ireland and GOCinC III Corps. Under Army Order No 38 of 1907, the title III Corps disappeared, but the Irish Command was constituted as a corps comprising 3rd Cavalry Brigade, 5th Infantry Division and 6th Infantry Division.

==First World War==
Pre-war planning for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) did not envisage any intermediate headquarters between GHQ and the six infantry divisions. However, on mobilisation the decision was made to conform to the two-division army corps organisation employed by the French armies alongside which the BEF was to operate and corps HQs therefore had to be improvised. III Corps HQ was formed in France on 31 August 1914 under Sir William Pulteney, taking over 4th Division, part of which had already fought at Le Cateau, and 6th Division, which arrived in early September. It was first engaged in the First Battle of the Marne, and remained on the Western Front throughout the Great War.

===First World War composition===
The composition of army corps changed frequently. Some representative orders of battle for III Corps are given here.

As initially constituted:

General Officer Commanding: Major-General William Pulteney
* Brigadier-General, General Staff: J. P. Du Cane
*Brigadier-General, Royal Artillery: E. J. Phipps-Hornby, VC
* Commander, Royal Engineers: Brigadier-General F. M. Glubb
* 4th Division
* 6th Division
* 19th Independent Brigade (attached to III Corps 6 October 1914; became part of 6th Division 12 October 1914)

Order of Battle at start of the Battle of the Somme, 1 July 1916:

General Officer Commanding: Lieutenant-General Sir William Pulteney
* 8th Division
* 19th (Western) Division
* 34th Division

Order of Battle during the final advance in Artois, 8 October 1918:

General Officer Commanding: Lieutenant-General Richard Butler
* 55th (West Lancashire) Division
* 74th (Yeomanry) Division

==Second World War==
During the Second World War, III Corps was formed in France under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Forbes Adam to control forces of the British Expeditionary Force, after the expansion of that force had rendered control by just two corps headquarters cumbersome. The Corps was withdrawn from Dunkirk after the defeat of British forces by the Germans in May 1940.

===Second World War composition===

Order of Battle at Dunkirk:

GOC: Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Forbes Adam (Lieutenant-General Sydney Rigby Wason after 26 May 1940) 
*42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division
*44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division
*Royal Artillery
**5th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery
**97th (Kent Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment
**51st (Midland) Medium Regiment
**56th (Highland) Medium Regiment
**54th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment
**3rd Survey Regiment
*III Corps Troops Royal Engineers
**213th, 214th, 217th Army Field Companies
**293rd Corps Field Park Company
**514th Corps Field Survey Company
*Infantry—Machine Gun
**7th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers
**1/9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment
**1st Battalion, Princess Louise&#x27;s Kensington Regiment, Middlesex Regiment

After commanding forces in the United Kingdom during late 1940, from the Old Rectory in Whitchurch, Shropshire within Western Command, the corps was used for deception purposes. It eventually ended up being transferred to Persia and Iraq Command as part of the British Tenth Army, under General Sir Edward P. Quinan. It took command of a number of formations there, including the British 5th Infantry Division.

On 16 October 1944 it became the headquarters for Lieutenant-General Ronald Scobie for operations in the Greek Civil War: at this point it received operational formations. Forces in Greece included 23rd Armoured Brigade. On 17 December 1944 it was redesignated HQ Land Forces and Military Liaison (Greece).

==General Officers Commanding==
Commanders have included:

From 1901 to 1905 the commander of the troops in Ireland was also commander 3rd Army Corps.
* 1 October 1901: General the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn
* 10 May 1904: General Lord Grenfell
* 5 August 1914 – 16 February 1918 Lieutenant-General William Pulteney
* 16 February – 26 February 1918 Major-General R. P. Lee (acting)
* 26 February – 11 August 1918 Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Butler
* 11 August – 11 September 1918 Lieutenant-General Sir A. J. Godley (temporary)
* 11 September 1918 Lieutenant General Sir Richard Butler
* 1939 – June 1940 Lieutenant-General Ronald Adam
* June–November 1940 Lieutenant-General James Marshall-Cornwall
* 1940 – 1943 Lieutenant-General Desmond Anderson
* December 1943 – December 1944 Lieutenant-General Ronald Scobie

<doc id="815813" wikidata="Q3774081" url="?curid=815813" title="Gracianus Municeps">
<text>Gracianus Municeps (also known as Gratianus) was a legendary King of the Britons, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia regum Britanniae&quot; (Latin: &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), a largely fictional account of British history. &quot;Municeps&quot; translates to &quot;freedman&quot;, meaning this individual was Gracianus the freedman. After the death of Roman Emperor Magnus Maximus, Gracianus seized the throne of Britain upon receiving word of Maximus&#x27;s demise, by whose orders he had been sent to defend the attacked island while Maximus was campaigning on the continent.

Gracianus was a freedman, who had served under Maximus during his campaigns in Rome and Germany, and was sent to Britain to defeat Wanius and Melga, the kings of the Picts and Huns respectively. He defeated the armies of both kings immediately upon arrival, ejecting them to Ireland. Soon after, word came that Maximus had died at the hands of either a supporter of the late Roman Emperor Gratian or by one of Gracianus Municeps&#x27; own followers. Despite mention previously made by Geoffrey of Monmouth of Dionotus, regent in Maximus&#x27; absence and king of Cornwall, Gracianus seized the crown of Britain and began a reign of terror throughout the island but soon certain plebs banded together and assassinated him. This led to a period of instability when news of his demise reached Britain&#x27;s enemies, but he was eventually succeeded by Constantine II of Britain, the brother of King Aldrien of Brittany.

Historically, the predecessor to Constantine was Gratian on whom Geoffrey&#x27;s tale was probably based. Bede refers to this Gratian as Municeps in Chapter XI of his &quot;Ecclesiastic History of the English People&quot; (&quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;) and the epithet is seemingly there to distinguish this Gratian from the earlier Gratian killed by the Usurper Magnus Maximus.

<doc id="815825" wikidata="Q633378" url="?curid=815825" title="Archibald Menzies">
<text>Archibald Menzies ( ; 15 March 1754 – 15 February 1842) was a Scottish surgeon, botanist and naturalist. He spent many years at sea, serving with the Royal Navy, private merchants, and the Vancouver Expedition. 

During his naval expeditions, he assembled the most extensive collection of extra-European lichen specimens of the 18th century, significantly contributing to the field of lichenology. He was the first recorded European to reach the summit of the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa and introduced the monkey puzzle tree (Chile pine) to England. 

== Life and career ==
Menzies was born at Easter Stix (or Styx) in the parish of Weem, in Perthshire, Scotland. While working with his elder brother William at the Royal Botanic Gardens, he drew the attention of Dr John Hope, professor of botany at Edinburgh University, who encouraged him to study medicine there. Having qualified as a surgeon, Menzies served as assistant to a doctor in Caernarvon, Wales, then joined the Royal Navy as assistant surgeon on . Present at Battle of the Saintes (12 April 1782), in peacetime Menzies served on Halifax Station in Nova Scotia.

In 1786 Menzies was appointed surgeon on board the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; (Captain James Colnett), on a fur-trading voyage round Cape Horn to the northern Pacific. This ship, in company of &quot;Princess Royal&quot; (Captain Duncan), visited North America, China, and Hawaii (the Sandwich Isles) several times; Menzies collected a number of new plants on this voyage, and also ensured that none of the crew died of illness. Menzies returned to Great Britain in 1789. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1790.

From 1791 until 1795, Menzies was appointed as naturalist to accompany Captain George Vancouver on his voyage around the world on HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;. When the surgeon fell ill, Menzies took over his duties. He collected many specimens of plants and animals during the voyage, returning them to the UK. He also made a detailed record of the voyage.
In 1794, while &quot;Discovery&quot; spent one of three winters in Hawaii, Menzies, with Lieutenant Joseph Baker and two other men, made the first recorded ascent to Mokuaweoweo, the summit of Mauna Loa. Menzies used a portable barometer to measure the height of the mountain as compared to its currently known height of .

It would be forty years before another European, fellow Scotsman David Douglas, would reach the summit on 29 January 1834.

In 1795, Menzies was served the seeds of the Chile pine, &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;, as a dessert while dining with the Viceroy of Chile. He was able to pop some seeds into his pocket and grow them on board ship on the way back to Europe, and returned to England with five healthy plants, the first seen in Britain. Known as the Monkey Puzzle tree, the Chile pine became a favourite in most formal gardens of the nineteenth century.

After the voyage, Menzies served with the Navy in the West Indies. He received the degree of M.D. at the University of Aberdeen in 1799. After retiring from the Navy he became a doctor and surgeon at Notting Hill, London. He became the father of the Linnean Society upon the death of Aylmer Bourke Lambert.

Menzies&#x27;s wife died in 1836. They had no children. Menzies himself died in London on 15 February 1842 and is buried in Kensal Green cemetery.

== Legacy ==

Menzies&#x27;s name is commemorated in the scientific names of several of the plants he discovered, including &quot;Menziesia&quot;, a genus of shrubs in the Ericaceae, and the Douglas fir &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;, the most commercially important tree in western North America. The Pacific madrone, an evergreen tree and largest of the Ericaceae, was named &quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot; in his honour by Friedrich Pursh. Similarly, John Edward Gray named the most common species of freshwater mussel in New Zealand, &quot;Echyridella menziesii&quot;, after Menzies.

Also named for Menzies, in a corrupted form as adapted by the Nuxalk people of the Bella Coola area of the Central Coast of British Columbia, is &quot;Bensins Island&quot;, as recorded by Alexander Mackenzie during his visit there shortly after Vancouver&#x27;s ship visited the area.

The Ainapo Trail he used to climb Mauna Loa is also known as &quot;Menzies Trail&quot;. One of the principal streets surrounding the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in Victoria, British Columbia is named Menzies Street. There is also a main logging road on Vancouver Island known as Menzies Main.

Many of the specimens collected by Menzies are planted in London&#x27;s Kew Gardens. He also brought back to London 112 separate collections of artefacts, which are housed at the British Museum. A comprehensive catalogue of these collections was not published until 1951.

=== Lichenological contributions ===
Menzies made significant contributions to the field of lichenology through his extensive collections of lichens during his naval career. Between 1784 and 1802, he amassed the most comprehensive collection of extra-European lichen taxa of the 18th century. His specimens came from diverse locations, including Nova Scotia, Staten Island, the west coast of North America, Sumatra, the Cape of Good Hope, New Zealand, Tahiti, Hawaii, and Saint Helena. Many of these collections represented first discoveries and type specimens, with 17 of the 194 species he collected being types.

The importance of Menzies&#x27;s lichen collections was not fully recognised until long after his death. His specimens were distributed to various contemporary botanists and are now housed in several major herbaria, including the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the Linnean Society of London, and the Natural History Museum, London. Menzies&#x27;s work laid the foundation for future studies in lichen biodiversity, particularly in North America and the Southern Hemisphere. His collections were studied by prominent lichenologists of the time, including Erik Acharius, who formally described 15 new species based on Menzies&#x27;s specimens.

<text>Fano () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the Marche region of Italy. It is a beach resort southeast of Pesaro, located where the &quot;Via Flaminia&quot; reaches the Adriatic Sea. It is the third city in the region by population after Ancona and Pesaro.

==History==

An ancient town of Marche, it was known as Fanum Fortunae after a temple of Fortuna located there. Its first mention in history dates from 49 BC, when Julius Caesar held it, along with Pisaurum and Ancona. Caesar Augustus established a &quot;colonia&quot;, and built a wall, some parts of which remain. In 2 AD Augustus also built an arch (which is still standing) at the entrance to the town.

In January 271, the Roman Army defeated the Alamanni in the Battle of Fano that took place on the banks of the Metauro river just inland of Fano.

Fano was destroyed by Vitiges&#x27; Ostrogoths in AD 538. It was rebuilt by the Byzantines, becoming the capital of the maritime Pentapolis (&quot;Five Cities&quot;) that included also Rimini, Pesaro, Senigallia and Ancona. In 754 it was donated to the Holy See by the Frankish kings.

The Malatesta became lords of the city in 1356 with Galeotto I Malatesta, who was nominally only a vicar of the Popes. Among the others, Pandolfo III resided in the city. Under his son, the famous condottiero Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, Fano was besieged by Papal troops under Federico III da Montefeltro, and returned to the Papal administration. It was later part of the short-lived state of Cesare Borgia, and then part of the duchy of the della Roveres in the Marche.

During the Napoleonic Wars it suffered heavy spoliations; the city had an active role in the Risorgimento. In World War I Fano was several times bombed by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. During World War II it was massively bombed by Allied aeroplanes due to hit the strategic railway and street bridges crossing the Metauro river. When the Nazis withdrew from the town they destroyed all of the bell towers in the town.

During the 1916 Rimini earthquakes, two spires of Fano Cathedral collapsed, a large stucco angel fell in the , and part of the belltower wall of the collapsed. Part of a wall of the Church of San Paterniano collapsed. The earthquake of 16 August caused an exodus from the town.

==Main sights==
===Religious structures===
* Fano Cathedral: (12th century), which was erected over a pre-existing cathedral destroyed by a fire in 1111. The current façade is from the 1920s restoration, but is similar to the original. The interior has a nave and two aisles. No remnants of the town&#x27;s namesake temple have been uncovered, nor any of the basilica that (we are told) Vitruvius built there.
* San Domenico
* San Pietro in Valle: 
* San Paterniano: (16th century) with a Renaissance cloister. 
* San Francesco: church housing the tombs of Pandolfo III Malatesta (designed by Leon Battista Alberti) and his first wife Paola Bianca Malatesta.
* Santa Maria Nuova: (1521) Church has an ancient portal and two works by Perugino (&quot;Annunciation of Fano&quot; and Fano Altarpiece, the latter including perhaps an intervention by Raphael).

Outside the city, in the place called Bellocchi, is the church of St. Sebastian (16th century), for the construction of which parts of the ancient cathedral were used.

===Secular structures===
* Arco d&#x27;Augusto: The upper story of this Roman gate was destroyed in a siege conducted on the order of Pope Pius II in 1463, although a bas-relief of it was made by Bernardino di Pietro da Carona in 1513 on an adjacent wall of the annexed church and the loggia of St. Michael, the former having a noteworthy Renaissance portal.
* &quot;Corte Malatestiana&quot;: built after 1357 by Galeotto I Malatesta. The 14th-century section includes a great vaulted hall (probably part of the first residence of the Malatesta in the city) and a small turret. The modern part was built under Pandolfo III in 1413–23. The current edifice was heavily restored in the 20th century, but original are the mullioned windows in Gothic style as well as the staircase and the loggia from a 16th-century restoration. Also noteworthy is the Borgia-Cybo Arch (late 15th century). The palace is connected to the &quot;Palazzo del Podestà&quot; by a modern bridge, probably present also in the original structure.
* &quot;Rocca Malatestiana&quot;: (Malatesta Castle) was partially destroyed in 1944. The most ancient part dates probably from pre-existing Roman and medieval fortifications. The castle in its current form was begun in 1433 or 1438 by Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. The now missing &quot;mastio&quot; was erected in 1452. Here Sigismondo&#x27;s son, Roberto, was besieged by Papal Troops in 1463 and signed the peace treaty that ended the Malatesta domination of Fano.
* &quot;Museo Civico of Fano&quot;: (Archeological Museum and Art Gallery), located inside the &quot;Palazzo Malatestiano&quot;, contains paintings by Guercino, Michele Giambono, and Giovanni Santi.
* &quot;Palazzo del Podestà&quot; or &quot;della Ragione&quot; (built from 1229 in Romanesque-Gothic style). The interiors are in Neoclassicist style, and it houses a museum with archaeological findings, coins, medals, and an art gallery with works by Guido Reni, Domenichino and others.
* &quot;Fontana della Fortuna&quot; (Fountain of Fortune) (17th century).

==Culture==
* &quot;Fano dei Cesari&quot; is held annually in July or August for a week. During the week there are a variety of cultural events ending with a parade in Roman costumes and chariot races.
* The Fano Jazz by The Sea festival is held annually for one week.
* The library, the Biblioteca Federiciana, was established on 17 November 1720.

The Ultimate Frisbee Fano Association was created in 2001. The association has 4 teams: Croccali (mixed), Mirine (women), Spaccamadoni (men) and Angry Gulls (juniors). Since 2001, the association has won 8 Italian championships.

<text>Hørsholm () is an urban area on the Øresund coast approximately north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It covers most of Hørsholm Municipality and straddles the borders neighbouring Fredensborg Municipality and Rudersdal Municipality.

Hørsholm proper is developed around Hirschholm Palace, which was constructed in the 1730s, but the town has later absorbed several of the nearby communities that are of much older origins.

==History==

===Palace and market town===

Hørsholm was founded in connection with the construction of Hirschholm Palace. Niels Eigtved created a plan for a residence town in 1737 and to stimulate its growth, it was given status as market town in 1739. However, it never came to serve as a market town and was still only a small settlement when the palace was demolished between 1810 and 1816. Over the following decades it grew as a garrison town and a local centre for trade.

===Industrialization===

A textile factory, later known as the Royal Military Textile Factory, had already been established in Usserød in the 1790s (closed 1981). It was later joined by other industrial enterprises, such as Hørsholm Textile Factory (1885–1975), Hørsholm Tobakspakkeri og Hørsholm Iron Foundry (1900–1965).

===20th-century growth===
In the 20th century, Hørsholm gradually grew together with the neighbouring communities Usserød, Rungsted and Smidstrup. Most recently, Hørsholm has grown together with Kokkedal in Fredensborg-Humlebæk Municipality and Trørød, Vedbæk and Gammel Holte in Rudersdal Municipality.

==Nature, parks and open spaces==
Hørsholm Slotshave, the former gardens of Hirschholm Palace, is the largest public park in Hørsholm. A little to the east of it lies Hørsholm Arboretum, part of the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science. Hørsholm Cemetery is Hørsholm&#x27;s largest cemetery. Rungsted Beach is Hørsholm&#x27;s most popular beach but bathing is also possible at Mikkelborg and from several other localities along the coast.

Hørsholm is surrounded by a number of small woodlands. They include Rungsted Hegn–Folehave Skov. Kokkedal Skov, Elleskoven and Stasevang Skov. The larger Jægersborg Hegn, which separates Hørsholm from Skodsborg to the south, adjoins the extensive UNESCO-LISTED deer park Jægersborg Dyrehave.

==Culture and attractions==
Trommen (&quot;The Drum&quot;) is Hørsholm&#x27;s principal cultural centre and also home to its main library. Hørsholm is home to several museums. Rungstedlund is the former home of the author Karen Blixen and is now home to the Karen Blixen Museum. The Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry was based in the few surviving buildings from Hirschholm Palace, but i now moved to Randers. Hørsholm is only about from Jægersborg Dyrehave and Store Dyrehave and some from Gribskov, all three included in the recently UNESCO-listed Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand developed by King Christian V in the late 17th century for hunting deer with hounds. The adjacent Hørsholm Local History Museum contains a Struense exhibition. Gammel Holtegård plays host to temporary art exhibitions as well as a permanent archeological exhibition. The small Fuglsangshus is also used as a venue for changing art exhibitions.

==Economy==
Hørsholm is linked to engineering consultancy and information technology. DTU science park, a science park now part of the Technical University of Denmark, is home to many technological start-ups.

Hørsholm Hospital used to be a major employer but has now closed.

The Danish roof window and skylight manufacturer VELUX has its company headquarters in Hørsholm.

==Transport==
* Rungsted Kyst railway station and Kokkedal railway station on the coast are located on Kystbanen and served by the Oresundtrains which continue to Copenhagen Airport and across the Øresund Bridge to Sweden.

The Hørsholm Highway (now Helsingør Highway) is Denmark&#x27;s oldest highway and connects Hørsholm to Copenhagen to the south and Helsingør to the north.

<text>Hillerød () is a Danish town with a population of 36,227 (1 January 2024) located in the centre of North Zealand approximately 30 km to the northwest of Copenhagen, Denmark.
Hillerød is the administrative centre of Hillerød Municipality and also the administrative seat of Region Hovedstaden (Capital Region of Denmark), one of the five regions in Denmark. It is most known for its large Renaissance castle, Frederiksborg Castle, now home to the Museum of National History. Hillerød station is the terminus of one of the radials of the S-train network as well as several local railway lines. The town is surrounded by the former royal forests of Gribskov to the north and Store Dyrehave to the south.

==History==
Hillerød was founded during the early medieval times. The name is first mentioned in 1552 as &quot;Hylderødz&quot;, deriving from the male name &quot;Hildi&quot; and the suffix &quot;-rød&quot;, meaning &quot;Hildi&#x27;s clearing&quot;.

In 1550, crown prince Frederick acquired Hillerødsholm in exchange for other properties. His son, Christian IV, tore down most of the old buildings and built a new castle between 1602 and 1625. It was never officially incorporated as a market town but prospered from ample privileges afforded by successive monarchs, although it experienced a setback when Frederick IV moved court to Fredensborg Palace in the 1720s. Hillerød was from 1772 until 1908 named Frederiksborg after its castle. Its first town council was established in 1778 and its town shield, which features a flowering elder tree, is from 1787.

The arrival of the railway brought new prosperity to the town, when the Zealand Railway Company opened the final stage of the North Line between Copenhagen and Helsingør on 8 June 1864. It was later followed by the Gribskov Line to Græsted (80, extended to Gilleleje in 1896, Helsinge in 1897 and Tisvildeleje in 1924) and the Frederiksværk-Hundested Line (1897-1916), which further contributed to Hillerød&#x27;s status as a local commercial centre. The improvements in infrastructure also attracted new industries. These included Nordstens Fabrikker, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, which opened in 1877. A privately owned slaughterhouse and meatpacking facility, Hillerød Svineslagteri, opened in 1896. It was converted into the cooperative Hillerød Andelssvineslagteri by 300 local farmers in 1913.

==Economy==
Foss A/S, a major provider of high-tech analytical solutions for the global food industry, is based in Hillerød. Novo Nordisk and FujiFilm Diosynth Biotechnology are other major employers with expanding sites in Hillerød&#x27;s industrial park. The pension fund ATP is also headquartered in Hillerød.

===Shopping===
The two principal shopping streets are Slotsgade and pedestrianized Helsingørsgade. The largest shopping centre is Slotsarkaderne with 50 stores.

=== The hospital project ===
Hillerød has been chosen as the site for a new regional hospital: &#x27;Nyt Hospital Nordsjælland&#x27; (English: &quot;New North Zealand Hospital&quot;). To support the hospital, a new urban zone called Favrholm will be created in the south end of the city, and a new S-train station will provide access to the hospital. The project began in 2012 and the hospital should be ready in 2020. When completed, &#x27;Nyt Hospital Nordsjælland&#x27; will be the largest hospital in the country.

==Education==
The characteristics of business life in Hillerød are primarily pharmaceutical industry, knowledge, production and education. The municipality and the state administers a number of educational institutions offering short-term or medium-term education. Among them are the Business Academy North Zealand, Hillerød Technical School, Hillerød Business School, Hillerød Tekniske Gymnasium, Frederiksborg Gymnasium og HF, VUC and Hillerød teacher training college.

The settlement of Nødebo on the southeastern banks of Esrum Sø and enclosed by Gribskov, is home to the forestry boarding school of &#x27;Skovskolen&#x27; (English: &quot;&#x27;The Forest School&quot;) administered by the University of Copenhagen.

Hillerød also houses a Pharmaceutical College. Pharmakon - Danish College of Pharmacy Practice () is a higher tertiary educational institution of pharmaceutical sciences with 602 pharmaconomist students.

==Attractions and tourism==

The best known monument is Frederiksborg Castle, which was long a seat of Danish kings. The castle is open to the public and houses the Frederiksborg Museum/ The Museum of National History. The castle also has a large baroque garden.

The Town Museum (&quot;Bymuseet&quot;) contains a permanent exhibition on the history of Hillerød.

&quot;The Boiler Room&quot; (&quot;Kedelhuset&quot;) has changing special exhibits. In 2005, the subject was the ancient and medieval history of Northern Zealand.

The ruins of Æbelholt Abbey (&quot;Æbelholt Klosterruin&quot;) are the remains of the largest Augustinian monastery in the northern countries. The site also contains a museum showing its history. The monastery was founded in 1175/76 by the French Augustinian, William of Æbelholt, later Saint William, for the reform of the already extant Eskilsø Abbey, which was moved here. He was summoned to the task by the Danish archbishop and statesman Absalon. After the Reformation in 1536, the monastery lands were appropriated by the state and the buildings were torn down. Some of the bricks were later used in the construction of Frederiksborg Castle.

Esrum Abbey (&quot;Esrum Kloster&quot;) is a Cistercian monastery dating from 1151. The only remaining building of this once vast complex now houses a permanent exhibition about the Cistercians. There is a restaurant in the vaults. Next to the monastery is &quot;Esrum Møllegaard&quot;, the Nature and Environmental Centre of Ecology.
Another cultural institution is &quot;Hillerød Viden- og Kulturpark&quot; (Hillerød Knowledge and Culture Park); a library with surrounding culture workshops and game spots. This is the gathering spot for the cultural life of Hillerød - with exhibitions, music and theatre.

==Nature and countryside==
Hillerød is surrounded by some of the most extensive woodlands in Denmark, with Store Dyrehave to the south and the forests of Gribskov to the north. Gribskov is the fourth largest connected woodland in the country and both of the forests are rich with wild game, primarily deer.

Just east of Gribskov is Esrum Sø, the second largest lake in Denmark and a few kilometers northeast of Hillerøds city center is Fredensborg Palace and its extensive baroque gardens, on the east coast of Lake Esrum.

Scattered around the vicinity of Hillerød, is a number of smaller settlements and villages like Tulstrup, Ullerød, Gadevang, Nødebo, Sørup and Ny Hammersholt. Ullerød is both an old parish and a new borough at 150 ha and is connected directly to Hillerød.
