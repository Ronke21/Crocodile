===Neighbouring municipalities===
===Division of the town===
Lippstadt consists of 18 districts:
==History==
Lippstadt was founded in 1168 by Bernhard II zur Lippe. 
In the early 13th century Lippstadt, with a population of 2700, had four parish churches. There was an Augustinian abbey which had existed since 1281.

From 1400, the enclave and town of Lippstadt were to be a condominium shared by the county of Lippe and the counts of Cleves-Mark, who were succeeded by the Hohenzollerns (Brandenburg/Prussia), a situation that endured until the middle of the 19th. century.

Heinrich von Ahaus founded one of his communities for women of the Brethren of the Common Life there.

In 1523 it formed a defensive alliance together with the neighbouring cities of Osnabrück, Dortmund, Soest and Münster.

Augustinians studying at the University of Wittenberg brought Martin Luther&#x27;s doctrine home with them. Thus in 1524 Lutheran doctrines were preached at Lippstadt by their prior Westermann, and the town was one of the first to embrace Lutheranism officially, though it resisted the rise of Calvinism in rural areas of Westphalia.

Colonel Edward Morgan, ( – after 1665), a Royalist during English Civil War 1642–1649, was Captain General of the Kings (Charles I) forces in South Wales. After the King&#x27;s arrest and execution, he fled to the continent, and married Anna Petronilla the daughter of Baron von Pöllnitz from Westphalia, Governor of Lippstadt. They had six children, two sons, and four daughters. He was later appointed Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica 1664–65. His nephew Henry Morgan left his Jamaican property to his godsons Charles Byndloss (b.1668) and Henry Archbold on condition they adopted the surname of Morgan. These were the children of his two cousins Anna Petronilla Byndloss (née Morgan), and Johanna Archbold (née Morgan).

In 1821 the Papal Bull &quot;De salute animarum&quot;, made over to the Bishopric of Paderborn the Lippian parishes of Cappel, Lipperode and Lippstadt, which had previously belonged to the Archbishopric of Cologne without producing any ensuing agreement with the state of Lippe.

In 1851 the whole of Lippstadt, which up to then had been divided between the Kingdom of Prussia and Lippe, was added to the Prussian royal province of Westphalia.

In 1944 a women&#x27;s subcamp of Buchenwald was founded in Lippstadt. It was also the site of a displaced persons camp in the years following World War II. On 1 April 1945 the US 2nd Armored Division made contact with the 3rd Armored Division at Lippstadt, effecting junction of the US Ninth Army with the US First Army, and seized the city from scattered resistance.

==Economy==
Lippstadt serves as headquarters of international automotive supplier&#x27;s Hella and HBPO Group. It is also home to a factory of large-diameter antifriction bearings, seamless-rolled rings manufacturer Rothe Erde.

<text>Plantation tradition is a genre of literature based in the Southern United States that is heavily nostalgic for antebellum times. The ideology is that of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, though this specific genre is often called &quot;The Plantation Myth.&quot;

The decades before the American Civil War saw several works idealizing the plantation, such as John Pendleton Kennedy&#x27;s 1832 &quot;The Swallow Barn&quot;. However, plantation tradition became more popular in the late-nineteenth century as a reaction against slave narratives like those of Frederick Douglass, and abolitionist novels like &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Prominent writers in the plantation tradition include Thomas Nelson Page (1853-1922) and Harry Stillwell Edwards (1855-1938). Other writers, especially African-American writers, soon satirized the genre: Charles W. Chesnutt&#x27;s &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot; (1899), for example, &quot;consciously evoke[d] the conventions of the plantation novel only to subvert them&quot;.

<text>The Community Connector is a municipally owned bus system connecting Bangor, Maine, with outlying towns, including Veazie, Orono, Old Town, Brewer, and Hampden. The system is owned and operated by the City of Bangor.

==Overview==
Most Community Connector buses are distinguished by their bright red color. The system is structured to make it easy for riders to reach points of interest in the Bangor area. In 2003 the Mall Hopper line was added to facilitate easy connections between the Airport Mall, the Bangor Mall, and the Broadway Shopping Center. The Black Bear Orono Express was added in 2009 as a shuttle between downtown Orono and the University of Maine campus with additional stops in the town of Orono. The Mall Hopper and Black Bear Express are also the only lines not to go through the Bangor Depot.

Several of the newer buses offer plush seats and air-conditioning, as well as low floors designed to make it easier for wheelchair passengers to board the bus without having to use a wheelchair lift. All buses are ADA compliant and are wheelchair ready.

Riders are allowed to get on and off at almost any intersection along the road, without having to use designated bus stops. There are a few exceptions where passenger safety is an issue.

The bus system was previously known as BAT Community Connector (or &quot;the BAT&quot;).

A free, unofficial mobile phone application for the Community Connector was released in March 2012 for both the iPhone and Android platforms. The app included routes and schedule information, displayed the amount of time until the next scheduled bus arrival, and calculated the distance and time information for the stops that are closest to your current position. However, the app is no longer available for download.

==Bus service==

<doc id="834865" wikidata="Q500052" url="?curid=834865" title="Mazda Demio">
<text>The is a subcompact/supermini/B-segment small car manufactured by Mazda since 1996. While sold across four generations in the domestic Japanese market, the Demio nameplate was rarely used outside of Japan, where it was usually called the Mazda2. The Demio nameplate was retired in 2019 as Mazda changed over to &quot;Mazda2&quot; for their home market as well.

The Demio is built on the Mazda D platform and was preceded by two other small cars based on the platform: the Ford Festiva (designed and built by Mazda for Ford and also sold as the Mazda 121) that was introduced in 1986 and the Revue (sold by Mazda&#x27;s Autozam marque) introduced in 1990. The name &quot;Demio&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;&quot; to show possession, which in many Romance languages has become &quot;mio.&quot;

The third generation Demio was among the top three finalists of the World Car Awards, which it won, while the fourth generation won the 2014–2015 Car of the Year Japan.

The first generation Demio was sold as the Ford Festiva Mini Wagon in some markets.


== First generation (DW; 1996) ==
When it came to redesigning the sedan-only Revue, Mazda came up with a tall hatchback, minivan-esque package - the Revue, at , had also been unusually tall. Introduced in a time full of negative press coverage for the company, the Demio became a surprise hit for Mazda in Japan, and also foreshadowed B-segment minivans such as the Opel Meriva, Fiat Idea and the Renault Modus.

A concept model previewing the DW series, called the Mazda BU-X was shown in 1995.

At its introduction in 1997, it won the Automotive Researchers&#x27; and Journalists&#x27; Conference Car of the Year award in Japan.

Production of the new Demio started in July 1996 (sold as the 121 outside Japan and Europe) used the DW platform. Ford retailed a version in Japan as the Ford Festiva Mini Wagon. In 1997, the Mazda logo was changed to the current logo. The Demio received a horizontal grille in September 1998 for Japanese market. The Demio received a facelift in December 1999 with a revised exterior, redesigned dashboard, cabin air filtration, retuned automatic transmission, and available DSC. The original Demio was replaced in 2002.

=== Production ===
The original DW model was produced in Mazda&#x27;s Colombia plant as &quot;Mazda Demio&quot; until the end of 2007 when the DE model replaced it.

== Second to fourth generation (2002–2019) ==
Beginning with the 2002 second generation Demio, export models received &quot;Mazda2&quot; badging. The third generation appeared in early 2007, followed by a fourth generation in September 2014. Mazda continued to call the car Demio in its home market (and some select export markets) until the nameplate was retired in favor of the global moniker in September 2019.

<doc id="834875" wikidata="Q5949943" url="?curid=834875" title="Husson University">
<text>Husson University is a private university in Bangor, Maine, United States. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees and as of Fall 2022 had a total enrollment of 3,065 students, including 636 graduate students in master&#x27;s and doctoral programs.

Husson University is one of four universities in the Bangor area (the University of Maine at Augusta, the University of Maine, and Beal University are the others) and the largest private university in the region. Husson also offers a number of online programs. The university previously operated satellite campuses around the state. The last of these campuses, at Northern Maine Community College, was shuttered in 2021. Students were transitioned to Husson&#x27;s online programs.

==History==
Founded in 1898, Husson was originally named Shaw School of Business and was located on the second floor of a building in downtown Bangor. Enrollment was low until after World War II, when its reputation grew as a business school. In 1953 the Maine Legislature authorized the school, newly-renamed as Husson College, to grant Bachelor of Science degrees. It subsequently became Husson University in 2008.

Today the University has four colleges, and two schools: the College of Business, the College of Health and Education, the College of Science and Humanities, the School of Pharmacy, and the New England School of Communications. The New England School of Communications, known by its abbreviation NESCom, was an independent school acquired by Husson in 1997, and was separately accredited and operated semi-autonomously with control over its own tuition, hiring, admissions, and graduation requirements until 2014.

Since 2000, undergraduate enrollment has increased five to ten percent with each incoming class. In response, the University continues to add a significant number of new faculty to its ranks. Today, students graduate having trained both in the specialties of their chosen fields and in how those fields fit into a broader cultural context. Husson ranks 54th on &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s ranking of top universities in the United States for social mobility.

==Accreditation==
Husson University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE). In addition, specific programs have their own professional accreditations or approvals:

* International Accreditation Council for Business Education (IACBE) for their business programs.
* Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) for their bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programs in nursing.
* Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) for their occupational therapy programs.
* Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) for their Doctor of Pharmacy program.
* Council for Accreditation of Counseling &amp; Related Educational Programs (CACREP) for their Clinical Mental Health Counseling and School Counseling graduate programs.
* Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) for their School of Physical Therapy.
* American Board of Physical Therapy Education Residency (ABPTRFE). The School of Physical Therapy is a member of this organization.
* State of Maine Department of Education has approved the school counseling and teacher education programs in the School of Education.
* National Board for Certified Counselors has approved the master&#x27;s degree programs in clinical mental health and school counseling to provide continuing professional education and development.

==Campus==
The Husson University Campus in Bangor includes the Newman Gymnasium, the Winkin Sports Complex, Robert O&#x27;Donnell Commons (the College of Health and Education is located here), Peabody Hall (including the Sawyer Library and the Ross Furman Student Center), Harold Alfond Hall (opened in 2021, home of the College of Business and School of Law), the Dickerman Dining Center (renovated in 2012), the Dyke Center for Family Business, the Wildey Communications Center, the Beardsley Meeting House which houses the 500-seat Gracie Theatre, and the Darling Living &amp; Learning Center which houses upperclassmen in suites and holds offices and classrooms on the ground floor. There are four residence halls: Hart Hall, Bell Hall, Carlisle Hall, and the Darling Living &amp; Learning Center, a LEED Silver targeted student residence and academic building which opened in the fall of 2012. Two walking trails circle the outer perimeter and offer scenic walks through the Maine forest.

===Gracie Theatre===
The Gracie Theatre, located in the Beardsley Meeting House, is a 500-seat multipurpose venue. Opera singer Richard Troxell, comedian Bob Marley, and the Bangor Symphony Orchestra have all performed in the Gracie. The New England School of Communications has staged musicals (including &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot;) there and operates the theatre during other events.

===Winkin Sports Complex===

Winkin Sports Complex is home of the Husson University baseball, field hockey, and football teams. The ballpark has a capacity of 3,000 people and opened in 2004. It was formerly the home of Bangor Lumberjacks. The complex was named in honor of retired head baseball coach John Winkin. In 2003, the city of Bangor contributed $381,000 towards the building of the complex. In 2004, the Lumberjacks played their only season at the complex. In May 2016, renovation were made which increased padding on the field at the cost of approximately $1 million.

==Student life==
There are dozens of student clubs and organizations, such as Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA), Student Government, The English Society, Accounting Society, Criminal Justice Club, OPTS (Organization of Physical Therapy Students), OOTS (Organization of Occupational Therapy Students), the Organization of Student Nurses, Outdoors Club, Student Newspaper, Husson University Theatre, GAMERS, Q&amp;A, Technology Club, Student Veterans Association, Running Club, Ski &amp; Snowboard Club, Pep Band, Audio Engineering Society, Cru, and Husson College Republicans. The University also owns WHSN 89.3 FM, an alternative rock station operated by the New England School of Communications.

Husson currently has two active sororities and one fraternity. 

==Athletics==
Husson University teams are known as the Eagles. They were known as the Braves until 2010. The university is a member of the NCAA Division III and fields twenty one varsity sports teams in the North Atlantic Conference (primary), Commonwealth Coast Football (football) and the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (swimming and diving). Sports offered include men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s football, women&#x27;s field hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field, women&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field, baseball, softball, and women&#x27;s volleyball. Husson University also has three spirit teams including Cheer Team, Dance Team, and Pep Band.

On November 30, 2023, the NCAA released a ruling from the Division III Committee on Infractions regarding an investigation of ethical conduct violations by a former Husson University swimming &amp; diving head coach. The former head coach knowingly allowed an unnamed student athlete to participate in physical therapy and team activities while clocked in for work as a student assistant in late 2022. This violation resulted in $1,385 of benefits to the student athlete from 103 hours of unperformed labor. Husson University self-reported the violation in December 2022 after discovering the violation and cooperated with the investigation. The NCAA ruling levied a punishment of one year of probation on the school and fined the university $1,250.

<doc id="834898" wikidata="Q5500848" url="?curid=834898" title="Freedom to Marry">
<text>Freedom to Marry was the national bipartisan organization dedicated to winning marriage for same-sex couples in the United States. Freedom to Marry was founded in New York City in 2003 by Evan Wolfson. Wolfson served as president of the organization through the June 2015 victory at the Supreme Court, until the organization&#x27;s official closing in February 2016.

Freedom to Marry drove the national strategy - what Freedom to Marry called the &quot;Roadmap to Victory&quot; - that led to the nationwide victory. The strategy aimed at a Supreme Court win bringing the country to national resolution, once advocates had succeeded in creating the climate for the court by working on three tracks: winning marriage in a critical mass of states, growing national majority support for marriage, and ending marriage discrimination by the federal government.

==History==

In 1983, at a time when same-sex couples had no country- or state-level recognition anywhere in the world, Evan Wolfson wrote his Harvard Law School thesis on the constitutional right to marriage for same-sex couples. He believed that by claiming the vocabulary of marriage, same-sex couples could transform the country&#x27;s understanding of who gay people were and, as a result, why exclusion and discrimination are wrong. The thesis outlined the arguments that ultimately became a national conversation and a legal and political set of battles that led to a transformation of public understanding and a triumph in the Supreme Court.

Wolfson went on to serve full-time as the marriage director of Lambda Legal throughout the 1990s. He worked as co-counsel in Hawaii&#x27;s landmark Baehr case, which launched the ongoing international freedom to marry movement. The Hawaii case foreshadowed the pattern ahead: a legal breakthrough followed by political defeat, because of insufficient progress in changing hearts and minds. When, in 2000, Wolfson was approached by leaders of the Evelyn &amp; Walter Haas Jr. Fund, he successfully proposed that the foundation make a $2.5 million challenge grant investment in 2001 – then the largest foundation award in the history of the LGBT movement from a highly respected, non-LGBT foundation – to help Wolfson build a new campaign to win marriage. The campaign was officially launched in 2003, the birth of Freedom to Marry.

Wolfson knew from studying the history of civil rights movements that marriage for same-sex couples would become the law of the land only when one of the country&#x27;s two national actors, Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court, brought national resolution to the cause. But a smart, strategic campaign was integral to creating the climate necessary to get to that point and to avoid seeing gains snatched away.

As in Hawaii (and even the earliest rounds of the marriage battle in the 1970s), litigation was central – but it wasn&#x27;t enough. Wolfson called for the creation of a campaign that reflected what he called the &quot;4 multi&#x27;s&quot;: it would be multi-year (not expected to win overnight), multi-state (not watching as victories were picked off one by one), multi-partner (no one organization could do it all), and multi-methodology (it would combine litigation, lobbying, public education, organization, direct action, fund-raising, and even, eventually, electoral). Wolfson knew that marriage advocates didn&#x27;t have to win every state, but they had to win enough states – and not every American had to be persuaded to support the freedom to marry, but enough Americans needed to be supportive before elected officials and judges, including the justices of the Supreme Court, would do the right thing.

Over two decades, the marriage movement built from only 27% support among the American people in 1993 to 59% in 2015; and from 0 states issuing marriage licenses in 2002 to 37 states and the District of Columbia in 2015, when the victories created the powerful momentum and energy that enabled the Supreme Court Justices to finish the job and strike down marriage discrimination once and for all.

==Areas of work==

===Messaging===
Beginning in 2010, Freedom to Marry created and coordinated a research collaborative, dubbed the Marriage Research Consortium, drawing together state and national partners such as the Movement Advancement Project, Basic Rights Oregon, and Third Way to &quot;crack the code&quot; on how to reach the next segment of the American public who were not yet part of the majority the campaign had achieved. Through cutting-edge research, focus groups, collaboration with the partners, and compilation of the experience gained in multiple campaigns (and losses), Freedom to Marry pioneered a new messaging playbook for the marriage movement called &quot;Why Marriage Matters&quot;. The playbook shifted from a previous focus on the rights and benefits that come with marriage towards values-based frames of love, commitment, freedom, family, and the Golden Rule. These were the messages that caused &quot;middle&quot; voters – those who Wolfson called the &quot;reachable but not yet reached&quot;—to move towards support, and helped contribute to the historic first victories for marriage at the ballot in 2012, to winning a majority of Americans in support of marriage, and to the movement&#x27;s ultimate victory in 2015.

===Advertising and media===
Through an aggressive and sophisticated media strategy, Freedom to Marry&#x27;s &quot;Press Room&quot; drove the national narrative around marriage and combated marriage opponents&#x27; fear-based messaging. Freedom to Marry funded, directed, and created ads showcasing unexpected surrogates and stories of Americans&#x27; journeys to supporting marriage. Compelling messengers included veterans, Republicans, and family members of same-sex couples, and helped make the case in the court of public opinion that all of America is ready for the freedom to marry.

===Digital Action Center===
Freedom to Marry launched its Digital Action Center to leverage the national organization&#x27;s successful online work and apply it across more than two dozen state digital campaigns. Freedom to Marry&#x27;s award-winning digital team developed cutting edge online tools and innovative content strategies to engage marriage supporters in effective action, advance the organization&#x27;s message online, raise funds, and tell the stories of people directly affected by marriage discrimination. In effect, Freedom to Marry was the digital &quot;back end&quot; of virtually all the key state campaigns in the last several years of the push. Freedom to Marry won numerous honors for its pioneering use of video and social work for advocacy such as the Silver 2015 Pollie Award.

===State campaigns===
Freedom to Marry&#x27;s work in the states almost always consisted of quickly and efficiently establishing state campaign coalitions, promoting teamwork, providing and enhancing expertise and a playbook of effective tactics, and generating needed funding. Freedom to Marry played a role in nearly every legislative and ballot win, and worked closely with its partners to create the climate for victory in states with pending litigation, enlisting expertise, resources, and infrastructure to support local advocates.

&quot;Why Marriage Matters&quot; was Freedom to Marry&#x27;s national public education campaign. The campaign was launched on February 14, 2011 The Why Marriage Matters project includes videos and stories from real people and real facts about why marriage matters, and was a critical part of long-term efforts in the states.

===President Obama and Democrats &quot;Say, &#x27;I Do===
In March 2011, Freedom to Marry launched an open letter calling on Barack Obama to support marriage for same-sex couples. Over 122,000 people signed their names to the letter, including numerous celebrities, civic leaders, and entrepreneurs. The campaign ended on May 9, 2012, when President Obama became the first sitting president of the United States to say he supports marriage for same-sex couples.

In February 2012, Freedom to Marry also launched a campaign to persuade the Democratic Party to include marriage for same-sex couples as a plank in the party platform at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. The campaign contributed to outspoken support from 22 Democratic Senators, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Chair of the Democratic National Convention Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Caroline Kennedy and nine other co-chairs of President Obama&#x27;s reelection campaign, and more than 40,000 Americans who added their names to Freedom to Marry&#x27;s online petition.

On July 29, the Democratic Party Platform Drafting Committee included a freedom to marry plank in the draft of the platform. The draft was ratified at the Democratic National Convention in September, making the Democratic Party the first major U.S. political party to officially support marriage for same-sex couples in the national party platform.

===Mayors for the Freedom to Marry===
In January 2012, Freedom to Marry launched the Mayors for the Freedom to Marry campaign (also known as Mayors for Marriage), encouraging mayors of cities throughout the United States to endorse marriage equality for their localities. Over 500 mayors from nearly all 50 states had joined the campaign by the time marriage was won in 2015. On January 13, 2012, San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, and West Sacramento Mayor Christopher Cabaldon published a column, &quot;Gay marriage a question of justice&quot;, in &quot;USA Today&quot;.

===Fundraising===
As the largest funder of the marriage movement, Freedom to Marry played a pivotal role in attracting broad foundation and individual donors. Donors spanned the political spectrum, from hedge fund giant Paul Singer, the founder and CEO of Elliott Management and a major Republican bundler, to acclaimed philanthropists Jon Stryker and Tim Gill, major supporters of Democratic candidates.

For example, in March 2012, Freedom to Marry launched the Win More States Fund, which identified battleground states where funding was most critically needed. The 2012 states included New Hampshire, Maine, Washington, Minnesota, New Jersey, and later Maryland. The goal was to raise at least $3 million to funnel into these state campaigns. The organization met this initial goal in early August 2012 and continued fundraising through the rest of the year, becoming the largest out-of-state funder in three of the state ballot-measure victories. All six of the states in the Win More States Fund won in 2012 - with Maine, Maryland, and Washington passing marriage for the first time at the ballot in the November 2012 election. Minnesota became the first state to block an anti-marriage amendment at the ballot (and passed a proactive marriage bill in the next legislative session). New Hampshire successfully blocked a measure to repeal marriage, and New Jersey passed marriage in the state legislature.

In February 2013, Freedom to Marry launched the second round of states for the Win More States Fund with a goal of raising and investing $2 million into campaigns to win marriage in Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island.

In total, Freedom to Marry raised over $60 million to win marriage nationwide. This money was invested into state, national, and federal programs, and directly into campaigns on the ground.

===Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry===
Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry is a campaign to highlight and build support for the freedom to marry among young conservatives across America. They represent young conservatives across the country that agree all Americans should be able to share in the freedom to marry. Notable members of Young Conservatives Leadership Committee include S.E. Cupp, Abby Huntsman, and Meghan McCain. The effort is managed by conservative activist Tyler Deaton.

On June 4, 2014, the campaign launched a national effort to &quot;reform the RNC platform&quot;. The &quot;reform the platform&quot; campaign launched in New Hampshire, consisting of a plan focused on the presidential primary states and &quot;leading up to the Republican National Convention in 2016&quot;.

<text>The , or &quot;Hollyhock Festival&quot;, (although commonly, but mistakenly identified as &quot;hollyhock&quot;, the &quot;aoi&quot; actually belongs to the birthwort family and translates as &quot;wild ginger&quot;—Asarum) is one of the three main annual festivals held in Kyoto, Japan, the other two being the Festival of the Ages (Jidai Matsuri) and the Gion Festival. It is a festival of the two Kamo shrines in the north of the city, Shimogamo Shrine and Kamigamo Shrine. The festival may also be referred to as the Kamo Festival. It is held on 15 May of each year.

==History==

According to the ancient, presumed historical and regarded as accurate with some fantastic embellishments, record &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the festival originated during the reign of Emperor Kinmei (reigned CE 539 - 571). The ancient records known as the &quot;Honchō getsurei&quot; (本朝月令) and &quot;Nenchūgyōji hissho&quot; (年中行事秘抄) reveal that a succession of disastrous rains with high winds ruined the grain crops, and epidemics had spread through the country. Because diviners placed the cause on divine punishment by the Kamo deities, the Emperor sent his messenger with a retinue to the shrine to conduct various acts to appease the deities, in prayer for a bountiful harvest. These included riding a galloping horse.

This became an annual ritual, and the galloping horse performance developed into an equestrian archery performance. According to the historical record known as the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; (続日本記, so many people had come to view this equestrian performance on the festival day in the 2nd year of the reign of Emperor Monmu (r. 697–707) that the event was banned.

In the ninth century, Emperor Kanmu established the seat of the imperial throne in Kyoto. This represented the beginning of the Heian period in Japanese history. Emperor Kanmu recognized the deities of the Kamo shrines as protectors of the Heian capital, and established the Aoi Matsuri as an annual imperial event.

The festival saw its peak of grandeur in the middle of the Heian period, but this waned in the Kamakura period and the following Muromachi period, and as the nation entered the Sengoku period, the festival procession was discontinued. In the Genroku era (1688–1704) of the Edo period, it was revived, but in the 2nd year of the Meiji period (1869), when the capital was moved from Kyoto to Tokyo, observance of the festival procession stopped. In Meiji-17 (1885), it was again revived as part of a government plan to enliven Kyoto. All but the rituals at the shrine fronts were discontinued from 1944, due to the Pacific War. At last, the festival procession started to be held again from 1953. The &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; festival princess tradition was initiated in 1956. The &quot;Saiō&quot; (斎王) was an unmarried female member of the Japanese imperial house.

The festival is named after the hollyhock (&quot;aoi&quot;) leaves used as decoration throughout the celebration as well as offerings to the gods. During the Heian Period, these leaves were once believed to protect against natural disasters such as earthquakes and thunder, and were often hung under the roofs of homes for protection. The plants used in the Aoi Matsuri may not be hollyhock, but possibly wild ginger. Although due to the rarity of these plants, other plants with similarly shaped leaves have been used in the festival instead, such as the leaves of the katsura tree.

==Festival events==

There are several events that take place during the month but the most important event is on 15 May.

There are two parts to Aoi Matsuri: the procession (&quot;rotō-no-gi&quot;) and the shrine rites. The procession is led by the Imperial Messenger. Following the imperial messenger are: two oxcarts, four cows, thirty-six horses, and six hundred people. The six hundred people are all wearing traditional dress of Heian nobles (&quot;ōmiyabito&quot;), while the oxcart (&quot;gissha&quot;) is adorned with artificial wisteria flowers. The procession starts at 10:30 on May 15 and leaves the Kyoto Imperial Palace in front of the main gate &quot;Kenreimon&quot; (建礼門) and slowly works its way towards the Shimogamo Shrine and finally the Kamigamo Shrine. When they finally arrive at both shrines, the &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; and Imperial Messenger perform their rituals. The &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; simply pays her respects to the deities and the Imperial Messenger intones the imperial rescript praising the deities and requesting their continued favor.

There are two main figures in the &quot;Aoi Matsuri&quot;: the &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; and the Imperial Messenger. Historically the &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; was a woman of the imperial house who was chosen from the sisters and daughters of the emperor to dedicate herself to the Shimogamo shrine. The role of &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; was to maintain ritual purity and to represent the emperor at the festival. Nowadays, the role of the &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; is a stand-in by an unmarried woman in Kyoto. She has to have the three attributes of wisdom, grace, and social standing. The selection process is strict and the news is announced in the press. It is the highest honour a woman can receive in Kyoto. 
The &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; is dressed in the traditional style of the Heian court. Traditional Heian court dress for women would be wearing several layers of exquisitely colored silk robes. The &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; wears twelve layers of the traditional style robes (jūnihitoe). To maintain ritual purity, the &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; goes through several ceremonies of purification before the procession of the festival. The Imperial Messenger leads the festival procession on horseback. During the Heian period he would be a Fifth-Rank courtier holding the office of middle or lesser captain and was usually a man destined for high office. His role was to read the imperial rescript of the shrines and present the emperor’s offerings. During the Heian period, the &quot;Saiō-Dai&quot; and the Imperial messenger would be accompanied by ten dancers and twelve musicians. Also present during the procession are guards (&quot;kebiishii),&quot; government officials, civic officials, military retainers, and a delegate from Yamashiro (&quot;Yamashiro-no-Tsukai)&quot;.

Also featured at the Aoi Matsuri are horse races (&quot;kurabe-uma&quot;), and demonstrations of mounted archery (yabusame).

Many things in Kyoto are named after the Aoi.

<text>Subhūti (Pali: Subhūti; ) was one of the ten principal disciples of the Buddha. In Theravada Buddhism, he is considered the disciple who was foremost in being &quot;worthy of gifts&quot; (Pali: &quot;dakkhiṇeyyānaṃ&quot;) and &quot;living remote and in peace&quot; (Pali: &quot;araṇavihārīnaṃ&quot; &quot;aggo&quot;). In Mahayana Buddhism, he is considered foremost in understanding emptiness (Sanskrit: &quot;Śūnyatā&quot;). 

Subhūti was born into a wealthy family and was a relative of Anāthapiṇḍika, the Buddha&#x27;s chief patron. He became a monk after hearing the Buddha teach at the dedication ceremony of Jetavana Monastery. After ordaining, Subhūti went into the forest and became an &quot;arahant&quot; while meditating on loving-kindness (Pali: &quot;mettā&quot;). It is said that due to his mastery of loving-kindness meditation, any gift offered to him bore the greatest merit for the donor, thus earning him the title of foremost in being &quot;worthy of gifts&quot;. Subhūti is a major figure in Mahayana Buddhism and is one of the central figures in Prajñāpāramitā sutras.

==In Theravada Buddhism==
===Previous life===
According to the Pali Canon, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Subhūti was born a man named Nanda. Nanda was born into a wealthy family and decided to leave his life behind to become a hermit. The hermitage Nanda was staying at was then visited by Padumuttara Buddha, who had his monk who was skilled in the practice of &quot;metta&quot; and was foremost in being &quot;worthy of gifts&quot; give a thanks-giving (Pali: &quot;anumodanā&quot;). While all of the other hermits at the hermitage attained &quot;arahantship&quot; following the teaching, Nanda did not and instead made a resolution to become the disciple foremost in being worthy of gifts of a future Buddha. This wish was fulfilled in the time of Gautama Buddha when he was reborn as Subhūti. 

===Biography===
According to the Pali tradition, Subhūti was born into a wealthy merchant family. His father was the wealthy merchant Sumana, and his older brother was Anāthapiṇḍika, who would later become the Buddha&#x27;s chief male patron. Texts relate that Subhūti was present at the dedication of Jetavana Monastery, which his older brother Anāthapiṇḍika had purchased and built for the Buddha. Upon hearing the Buddha teach at the dedication, Subhūti became inspired and ordained as a monk under him. After mastering the monastic rules, he went to live in the forest where he attained &quot;arahantship&quot; while meditating on the &quot;absorption of loving-kindness&quot; (Pali: &quot;mettā-jhāna&quot;). Subhūti became known for teaching the Dhamma &quot;without distinction or limitation&quot;, meaning regardless of the listener&#x27;s potential, and was declared the disciple foremost in &quot;living remote and in peace&quot; (Pali: &quot;araṇavihārīnaṃ&quot; &quot;aggo&quot;). During alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for food from laypeople, Subhūti had a habit of developing &quot;mettā-jhāna&quot; at every household, making it so people who gave him alms received the highest possible merit from the offerings. Because of this, the Buddha also declared him the disciple who was foremost in being worthy of gifts (Pali: &quot;dakkhiṇeyyānaṃ&quot;). 

In one story, Subhūti visited Rājagaha where King Bimbisara promised to build him a hut. However, the king forgot, thus forcing Subhūti to meditate in the open air. It is said that due to the power of his virtue rain would not fall, and when King Bimbisara found out about the cause of the lack of rain he had a leaf hut constructed for him. According to the text, when Subhūti sat down in the hut, rain began to fall.

==In Mahāyāna Buddhism==

Subhūti plays a much larger role in Mahayana Buddhism than in Theravada Buddhism. In Mahayana Buddhist tradition, he is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in understanding &quot;Śūnyatā&quot;, or emptiness, and is a central figure in Mahayana Prajñāpāramitā texts. Buddhist scholar Edward Conze describes him as being regarded as the foremost disciple in Mahayana Buddhism.

=== Early life ===
According to northern Buddhist texts, Subhuti was born into a wealthy family in &quot;Śrāvastī&quot; and on the day of his birth, all of his family&#x27;s gold and silver suddenly disappeared, symbolizing that he was born of emptiness, according to Buddhist commentators. The family&#x27;s gold and silver was then said to have reappeared seven days later. In the northern Buddhist tradition, Subhuti was the nephew of Anāthapiṇḍika and had a notoriously bad temper. Subhūti was present at the dedication of Jetavana Monastery, which his uncle Anāthapiṇḍika had purchased and built for the Buddha. Upon hearing the Buddha teach at the dedication, Subhūti became inspired and ordained as a monk under him eventually developing a calm mind and temperament.

=== Person ===
Chinese Buddhist commentaries state that when going on alms rounds, Subhuti prioritized collecting alms from the wealthy. This was in contrast to another Buddhist disciple, Mahākāśyapa, who prioritized collecting alms from the poor. According to Chinese Buddhist monk Hsing Yun, Mahākāśyapa prioritized receiving alms from poor households reasoning that poor people needed the merit from alms-giving the most, while Subhuti reasoned that collecting alms from poor people increased their hardship, therefore he collected alms from rich households who would not be burdened by such giving. Chinese Buddhist texts state that the Buddha later rebuked both of them for these practices, telling them that collecting alms should be done indiscriminately.

Among the Mahāyāna traditions, Subhūti is perhaps best known as the disciple with whom the Buddha speaks when imparting the Diamond Sūtra (Sanskrit: &quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;, Chinese: 金剛經 or 金剛般若經), an important teaching within the Prajñāpāramitā genre. This, along with the Heart Sūtra (Sanskrit: &quot;Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya&quot;, Chinese: 心經 or 般若心經), is one of the most well-known sūtras among both practitioners and non-practitioners of Buddhism. Subhūti is also responsible for much of the exposition in earlier Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. In northern Buddhist texts, when the Buddha descended to Sankassa after spending the rainy season in Tavatimsa heaven, Subhuti, recalling that the Buddha said that one can see him by meditating, remained in meditation rather than going to greet him. Upon arriving the Buddha stated that Subhuti was the first to greet him upon his return, having seen the Buddha&#x27;s spiritual body before the other disciples greeted his physical body.

In the Lotus Sutra (Sanskrit: &quot;Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra&quot;, Chinese: 法華(花)經 or 妙法蓮華(花)經), Chapter 6 (Bestowal of Prophecy), the Buddha bestows prophecies of enlightenment on Subhūti, along with other śrāvakas such as Mahākāśyapa, Mahākātyāyana, and Mahāmaudgalyāyana.

==In Zen writings==
In Zen Buddhism, Subhūti appears in several koans, such as this one:

One day, in a mood of sublime emptiness, Subhuti was resting underneath a tree when flowers began to fall about him. &quot;We are praising you for your discourse on emptiness,&quot; the gods whispered to Subhuti. &quot;But I have not spoken of emptiness,&quot; replied Subhuti. &quot;You have not spoken of emptiness, we have not heard emptiness,&quot; responded the gods. &quot;This is the true emptiness.&quot; The blossoms showered upon Subhuti as rain.

This story also appears in the Diamond Sutra.

==Lineage of the Panchen Lamas==
In the lineage of the Panchen Lamas of Tibet there were considered to be four &quot;Indian&quot; and three Tibetan incarnations of Amitabha Buddha before Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, who is recognised as the first Panchen Lama. The lineage starts with Subhuti.

==In Chinese literature==
A Taoist character based on Subhūti, Puti Zhushi, appears in the Chinese classical novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, as the teacher of the Monkey King Sun Wukong. The story of Sun Wukong first meeting Subhūti was a play on the Zen story of Huineng meeting Hongren, as told in the Platform Sūtra of Zen Buddhism. Because of the role that Subhūti plays in the story, his name has remained familiar in Chinese culture.

<text>Punish is a technical death metal band from Switzerland, formed in 1996. The band has shared the stage with international bands including: Artillery, Atheist, Belphegor, Cannibal Corpse, Destruction, Exhumed, Hour of Penance and Illdisposed.

== History ==
The band was formed in 1996 by André Mathieu, guitarist Ralph Huber and bass player Reto Hardmeier. In 1998 drummer Reto Crola and singer Chris Block completed the lineup. Together, they composed their first song, the result of which was their self-titled debut album released in 2000.

In 2001 Mirko Siegwart became their new bass player. The MCD &quot;Three Songs of Mental Disorder&quot; was released in 2004, followed by the EP &quot;Four Songs In Morbid Lust,&quot; a year later. Both records were recorded at Mastersound Studio in Germany. In 2005, Hardmeier rejoined the band.

When Block left in 2006, Reto and Mathieu took over vocals. That year the band toured Europe together with Helheim. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Dawn of the Martyr,&quot; appeared in 2007. In 2008 they played together with Nocturnus on another European tour. Their third album &quot;Raptus&quot; was released in 2009. In 2012 Mathieu took over all vocal parts, abandoning the Two-Voice-Concept. In 2013 Punish released their fourth album &quot;Sublunar Chaos,&quot; via Apostasy Records and Monika Hagmann became the band&#x27;s new bass player.

In 2016 Punish announced on their website that guitar player Ralph Huber left the band and has been replaced by Oli Keller.

== Style ==
Punish plays ambitious technical death metal, where the guitar parts are partly reminiscent on those of Death.

<text>Frank John Gorshin Jr. (April 5, 1933 – May 17, 2005) was an American actor, comedian and impressionist. He made many guest appearances on television variety and talk shows, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Tonight Starring Steve Allen&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. 

As an actor, he played the Riddler on the live-action television series &quot;Batman&quot; and was nominated for an Emmy Award for the performance.

==Early life==
Gorshin was born on April 5, 1933, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Catholic parents Frances, a seamstress, and Frank Gorshin Sr., a railroad worker. He was of Slovenian ancestry. His father, Frank Sr., was a second-generation Slovenian-American whose parents emigrated to America from Slovenia. His mother, Frances or Fanny, née Prešeren, came to the United States as a young girl from Regrča Vas, near Novo Mesto, the main city of Lower Carniola, in Slovenia. Both of his parents were active in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Slovenian community. They sang in the Slovenian Singing Society Prešeren, named after the great Slovenian poet France Prešeren.

In an interview, Frances said that her son, being the product of a Slovenian home, spoke mostly Slovene before going to school. At the age of 15, he took a part-time job as a cinema usher at the Sheridan Square Theatre. He memorized the mannerisms of the screen stars he saw and created an impressionist act. He was still in high school when he obtained his first paid employment, which he secured as the prize in a Pittsburgh talent contest in 1951: a one-week engagement at Jackie Heller&#x27;s New York nightclub, Carousel. His parents insisted that he take the engagement, even though his 15-year-old brother had been hit by a car and killed just two nights before.

After graduation from Peabody High School, Gorshin attended the Carnegie Tech School of Drama (now known as Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh. When not studying, he worked in local plays and nightclubs.

In 1953, Gorshin was drafted into the United States Army and posted to Germany. He served for a year and a half as an entertainer attached to Special Services. While in the Army, Gorshin met Maurice Bergman, who later introduced him to Hollywood agent Paul Kohner. Gorshin&#x27;s Army service record was later destroyed in the U.S. National Personnel Records Center fire of 1973.

==Career==
When Gorshin left the Army, he returned to public performance, and in 1956, he became a prolific film actor. He also appeared on various television series, including the role of Hank Butts, with Michael Landon cast as Jim Mason, in the 1958 episode &quot;Shadow of Belle Starr&quot; of the syndicated Western series &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot;, starring Rex Allen. In 1959, he was cast in three episodes as Seaman Pulaski on Jackie Cooper&#x27;s CBS military sitcom/drama &quot;Hennesey&quot;. Thereafter, Gorshin played roles in ABC&#x27;s crime drama &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. In 1961, Gorshin gave a tour de force performance as an impressionist who kills his fiancée under the influence of one of his celebrity characters in &quot;The Defenders&quot;. He guest-starred 12 times on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, with his first appearance being on June 17, 1962. He appeared on the show on February 9, 1964, the same night The Beatles and Davy Jones made their debut. In 1963, Gorshin had a guest-starring role in the long-running ABC military series &quot;Combat!&quot; as Pvt. Wharton who took false credit for the heroism of his dead friend, but redeemed himself later, saving Sgt. Saunders. In another episode in 1965 he played Pvt. Gavin, a tank operator who had washed out of U.S. Army Armor tank operations training.

Gorshin was a popular act at nightclubs, notably those of Las Vegas, where he was the first impressionist to headline the main showrooms. He was also the first impressionist headliner at the Empire Room of New York&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Among his most popular impressions were of Burt Lancaster (exaggerating Lancaster&#x27;s hand gestures) and Kirk Douglas (exaggerating Douglas&#x27; gritted teeth), as well as Marlon Brando (spoofing his squint). He was also popular for simulating bodily and facial resemblances, and pitch-perfect imitations of voice, accent, and vocal inflections and mannerisms. Gorshin&#x27;s slender athletic build, wide mouth, and pale eyes under strong brows were ideal characteristics for screen henchmen.

In 1957, he was in a car crash when he fell asleep at the wheel of his car after driving from Pittsburgh for 39 hours without sleep. He was on his way to a Hollywood screen test for the role of Petty Officer Ruby in &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;. He sustained a fractured skull and spent four days in a coma; a Los Angeles newspaper incorrectly reported he had been killed. The role went to Don Rickles.

Gorshin&#x27;s first film role was &quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot;. In the late 1950s, Gorshin had roles in B-movies such as &quot;Hot Rod Girl&quot; (1956), &quot;Dragstrip Girl&quot; (1957) and &quot;Invasion of the Saucer Men&quot; (1957). In 1960, he was featured in &quot;Bells are Ringing&quot;, playing the Method Actor while doing a Marlon Brando impression. As a dramatic actor, he often played &quot;tough guys&quot; like those played by one of his favorite targets of impressions, James Cagney, whom he was said to resemble. He did take a comic turn, though, as the hipster jazz bassist Basil (paired with singer Connie Francis) in &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; (1960), as a bumbling kidnapper in the Hayley Mills vehicle &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (1965), and as a boss-behind-bars for laughs in Otto Preminger&#x27;s comedy &quot;Skidoo&quot; (1968).

In 1962, Gorshin was cast as Billy Roy Fix in the episode &quot;The Fire Dancer&quot; of the NBC modern Western television series &quot;Empire&quot;, starring Richard Egan as the rancher Jim Redigo.

From 1966 to 1968, Gorshin played the Riddler on ABC&#x27;s 1960s live-action television series &quot;Batman&quot;, starring Adam West and Burt Ward, and was nominated for an Emmy Award (Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Comedy). Gorshin&#x27;s portrayal of the character included a high-pitched, deranged cackle, inspired by that of Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) in &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1947). Gorshin disliked the Riddler&#x27;s original unitard costume from the comics, and had a green business suit and bowler hat marked with question marks created as an alternative, a variant of which would be later adapted in the comics itself. He played the Riddler in ten episodes as well as the 1966 theatrical film, but a pay dispute with ABC prior to season 2 resulted in him being replaced by John Astin for two episodes. Gorshin was very angry about being replaced by Astin, but he agreed to return in Season 3 in an episode entitled &quot;Ring Around The Riddler&quot;. He reprised the role in the 1979 television film &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;.

Gorshin also had a memorable role in the 1969 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot; as the bigoted half-whiteface, half-blackface alien Bele from the planet Cheron. Contrary to popular rumor and several news articles, Gorshin did &quot;not&quot; receive an Emmy nomination for this role.
In the early 1970s, Gorshin appeared on Broadway in &quot;Jimmy&quot; (1969) and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1971). He made numerous guest-starring appearances on such television series as &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (1969) &quot;Ironside&quot; (1974), &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (1974), &quot;Get Christie Love!&quot; (1975), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1977) and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (1977). In 1979, he played interplanetary assassin Seton Kellogg in a two-part episode of the television series &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; titled &quot;Plot to Kill a City&quot;.

In 1982, Gorshin acted and sang the role of irascible King Gama in a TV production of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, as part of the PBS series &quot;The Compleat Gilbert and Sullivan&quot;, and subsequently in live performance at other venues.

He also appeared as the villainous Dan Wesker in the miniseries &quot;Goliath Awaits&quot; (1981); and played the role of Smiley Wilson on the ABC soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (1981–82), where he used his impersonation talents to mimic other performers on the series. During this decade, he also guest starred in episodes of series such as &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; (1984), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1988) and &quot;Monsters&quot; (1989).

During the 1990s, he featured as a mobster kingpin in &quot;The Meteor Man&quot; (1993), played the evil sorcerer Brother Septimus in &quot;The Tale of the Carved Stone&quot; episode of &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; (1993), voiced the character of Reverend Jack Cheese in an episode of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (1995). Notably, he appeared in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995) as the gruff superior to Madeleine Stowe&#x27;s psychiatrist. Gorshin also provided the voice of Daffy Duck and Foghorn Leghorn in the 1996 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short &quot;Superior Duck&quot; as well as voicing Foghorn and Yosemite Sam in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Pullet Surprise&quot; and &quot;From Hare to Eternity,&quot; respectively.

In his final years, Gorshin portrayed the famous comedian George Burns on Broadway in the one-man show &quot;Say Goodnight, Gracie&quot; (2002), which was nominated for a 2003 Tony Award for best play and was reunited with several of his &quot;Batman&quot; colleagues in the television film &quot;Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt&quot;, in which he appeared as himself. Gorshin died on the day of the telefilm&#x27;s DVD release. He played the strict legendary Harvard Law School Professor, John H. Keynes, in the Korean drama &quot;Love Story in Harvard&quot; (2004), and voiced villain Hugo Strange in three 2005 episodes of &quot;The Batman&quot; animated series. He also voiced the characters Marius and Lysander in the computer role playing game &quot;Diablo II&quot;.

Gorshin&#x27;s last television appearance was in &quot;Grave Danger&quot;, an episode of the CBS series &quot;&quot; which aired two days after his death; the episode, which was directed by Quentin Tarantino, was dedicated to his memory. While he was known for his impressions, his role on &quot;CSI&quot; was as himself.

Gorshin&#x27;s final role was as a voice actor in the unreleased animated feature film &quot;Firedog&quot;.

==Personal life==
On April 8, 1957, Gorshin married Christina Randazzo. They had one son, Mitchell, and later separated but remained married until his death.

==Death==
Gorshin&#x27;s final live appearance was a Memphis performance of &quot;Say Goodnight, Gracie,&quot; in which he portrayed George Burns. He finished the performance and boarded a plane for Los Angeles on April 25, 2005. After he experienced severe breathing difficulty during the flight, the crew administered emergency oxygen. An ambulance met the plane upon landing and Gorshin was transported to a Burbank hospital, where he died three weeks later, on May 17, 2005, aged 72 from lung cancer, complicated by emphysema and pneumonia. Gorshin had been a heavy smoker for most of his adult life, consuming up to five packs of cigarettes a day. His Batman co-star Adam West once claimed that &quot;Frank could reduce a cigarette to ash with one draw.&quot; When Gorshin appeared in nightclubs or other live performances, audiences were warned not to attend if they disliked smoking, as he often smoked onstage.

Gorshin is interred at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in the Hazelwood section of Pittsburgh.

<doc id="834989" wikidata="Q9002149" url="?curid=834989" title="Harry Bates (sculptor)">
<text>Harry Bates (26 April 1850 – 30 January 1899) was a British sculptor. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1892 as A.R.A. and was an active, if intermittent, member of the Art Workers Guild. He was a central figure in the British movement known as New Sculpture.

==Early life and education==
Bates was born on 26 April 1850 in Stevenage in Hertfordshire. He began his career as a carver&#x27;s assistant, and before beginning the regular study of plastic art he passed through a long apprenticeship in architectural decoration working from 1869 for the firm of Farmer &amp; Brindley.

==Career==
In 1879 he went to London and entered the South London School of Technical Art (formerly known as Lambeth School of Art, now the City and Guilds of London Art School). There he studied under Jules Dalou and won a silver medal in the national competition at South Kensington. 
In 1881, he was admitted to the Royal Academy schools, where in 1883 he won the gold medal and the travelling scholarship with his relief of &quot;Socrates teaching the People in the Agora&quot;.

In 1883 he immediately went to Paris, where he took up an independent studio (on Dalou&#x27;s suggestion) in 1883–85. 
He was influenced by Rodin, who advised him on occasion about his work.
A head and three small bronze panels (the Aeneid), executed by Bates in Paris, were exhibited at the Royal Academy, and selected for purchase by the Chantrey Bequest trustees; but the selection had to be cancelled, because they had not been modelled in Britain.

In 1886, Bates returned to Britain and was elected to the Art Workers Guild.
He created panels of &quot;Aeneas&quot; (1885), &quot;Homer&quot; (1886), three panels of &quot;Psyche&quot; and Rhodope (1887).

Bates&#x27;s primary skill lay in the composition and sculpting of relief sculpture, and it is in this medium that he achieved his most technically and aesthetically refined work. 
The freestanding ideal sculpture remained the most important of sculptural genres, however. Bates gradually turned to statues such as the 1889 &quot;Hounds in Leash,&quot; which is essentially a relief composition translated to three dimensions. In this work, Bates demonstrated his ability to convey muscular intensity and movement and led to his greater success and ambition.

His next major statue, the 1890 &quot;Pandora&quot;, was more truly a figure in the round. The life-sized figure was unusually nude, compared to other contemporary depictions. In 1890 this was received as a &quot;fresh reading of the subject, and instead of the customary elf-like or voluptuous woman [Bates] has shown a tender, very gentle and happy maiden, whose features are charming&quot;. In this work Bates experimented with polychromy and mixed materials, making it self-consciously into a paradigmatic example of his artistic priorities. The box she holds is an actual decorative casket made of ivory and gilt bronze and elaborately carved with scenes from the Pandora legend. It was exhibited in 1890 at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and purchased within the following year for the Chantrey Bequest. The gallery label at the Tate said in 2010, &quot;Bates shows the moment of hesitation before Pandora opens the forbidden box. He suggests Pandora&#x27;s mood of consideration and temptation while also recognising the inevitable fulfilment of the myth. This way he acknowledges the compulsion of character, and frailty of the human spirit.&quot; His creation of the marble altar front for the Holy Trinity church in Sloane Street, London was another piece he created in 1890.

In the year of his death 1899, Bates finished &quot;Mors Janua Vitae&quot; (death, gateway of life), now at Walker Art Gallery Liverpool. In 2007 it has been described as &quot;bizarre polychrome symbolist fantasy&quot;.

One of his final commissions was a large bronze statue of Queen Victoria unveiled in Albert Square in Dundee shortly after his death.

==Personal life and death==
Bates died in poverty, having drained his finances &quot;by his insistence on financing the Calcutta statue of Lord Roberts from his own pocket.&quot;
He died on 30 January 1899 at his residence, 10 Hall Road, St. John&#x27;s Wood, N.W. He was buried at Stevenage on 4 February.

==Assessment==
The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica wrote: &quot;The portrait-busts of Harry Bates are good pieces of realism: strong, yet delicate in technique, and excellent in character. 
His statues have a picturesqueness in which the refinement of the sculptor is always felt. Among the chief of these are the fanciful &quot;Maharaja of Mysore&quot;, somewhat overladen with ornament, and the colossal equestrian statue of &quot;Lord Roberts&quot; (1896) upon its important pedestal, girdled with a frieze of figures, now set up in Calcutta, and a statue of Queen Victoria for Dundee. But perhaps his masterpiece—in which his interest in polychromy and mixed materials in a format that fused decorative art and sculpture achieved its fullest realization—was an allegorical presentment of &quot;Love and Life&quot;, a winged male figure in bronze, with a female figure in ivory being crowned by the male.&quot; The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica felt, &quot;his premature death robbing English plastic art of its most promising representative at the time&quot;.

As of 2022, the figure of Pandora is understood &quot;as one of the many femme fatales whose deadly attraction mesmerised Victorian men.&quot; While continental sculptors experimented with the ancient chryselephantine technique in the 1840s, Bates Pandora was the first chryselephantine work by a British artist.

Bates is primarily remembered as one of the most important sculptors working with the traditions of the decorative arts within the New Sculpture movement. 
Both through his innovative use of polychromy and his allusive subject matter, he is understood to be one of primary representatives of international Symbolism within British sculpture.

<doc id="835024" wikidata="Q6152456" url="?curid=835024" title="Jane L. Campbell">
<text>Jane Louise Campbell (born May 19, 1953) is an American politician who served as the 56th and first and to date only female mayor of Cleveland, Ohio from January 1, 2002, to January 1, 2006.

==Early life and education==
Campbell was born on May 19, 1953, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Her mother, Joan Brown Campbell, served as the General Secretary of the National Council of Churches and her father was a partner at Squire, Sanders and Dempsey. Campbell attended Shaker Heights High School, and earned her undergraduate degree in American History from the University of Michigan. She subsequently earned a Master&#x27;s in Urban Studies at the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University.

==Career==
Prior to entering politics, Campbell worked with several community organizations and advocacy groups. In 1975, she founded WomenSpace, a coalition of women&#x27;s organizations that, in addition to promoting the creation of Ohio&#x27;s first shelter for battered women, helped identify and promote women for community and government leadership.
Soon after in 1979, she worked as National Field Director for ERAmerica in Washington, D.C., coordinating national support for state coalitions supporting the Equal Rights Amendment. In the early 80s, as the executive director of the Friends of Shaker Square, a neighborhood on Cleveland&#x27;s east side, Campbell managed economic development, organized security patrols and expanded the historic district.

===Politics===
Campbell&#x27;s political career began in 1984, when she was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. She was reelected five times, and chosen by her colleagues as the majority whip and later the assistant minority leader. Legislative leaders across the country elected her to serve as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures in 1996. Campbell authored numerous laws that included tax incentives for economic development, financing for Cleveland Browns Stadium, Gateway complex (now Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena), authorizing prosecution of abuse and neglect of elderly and disabled people, creating a statewide review of child deaths, reforming juvenile justice, and establishing child support guidelines and penalties.
Campbell was also appointed to work with the Clinton administration on a small intergovernmental group composed of governors, mayors, county officials, and state legislators to consult on the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act.

In 1996 she was elected Cuyahoga County commissioner, a position to which she was reelected in 2000. As commissioner, she transformed the county welfare department into Cuyahoga Work and Training, the agency charged with implementing the federal welfare reform law. This reformed agency assisted over 20,000 families in moving from welfare to work between 1997 and 2001. Campbell also brokered a new public–private alliance for workforce training, and she developed training academies at Cuyahoga Community College to provide job training to dislocated workers. She also led the drive to create Cuyahoga County&#x27;s first Brownfield Loan Fund in conjunction with seven local banks to redevelop abandoned industrial and commercial sites. To date, this fund has generated over $50M in private investment.

While serving as commissioner, she continued her national involvement, presiding over both the Welfare Reform: Next Step Task Force for the National Association of Counties and the association&#x27;s Human Services and Youth committee.

====Mayor of Cleveland====

In November 2001, Campbell won the Cleveland mayoral election with 54% of the vote, defeating former Clinton administration official and attorney Raymond Pierce, who received 46% of votes. She took office on January 1, 2002, becoming the city&#x27;s first female mayor.

In office, Campbell inherited a $60 million budget deficit and a city government in financial turmoil. In just one year, she stabilized the city&#x27;s budget without a tax increase. However, some city services endured cutbacks, and the following year she had to lay off many city employees in order to maintain financial stability.

One of her political accomplishments was bringing the Lakefront Plan to the forefront of regional awareness, a plan that emphasized Lake Erie as the region&#x27;s most valuable asset and a vital element for revitalization in Downtown Cleveland.

Throughout her four years, Campbell worked with other levels of government and the private sector to initiate nearly $3 billion of investments for urban development and redevelopment projects. By 2005, several of these projects were underway, including Steelyard Commons (a Brownfield-turned-shopping center, opened Sept. 2007), Gordon Square Arts District, Battery Park (redeveloped Eveready Battery Plant), The Avenue District, Fourth Street redevelopment, and Euclid Avenue rapid transit corridor.

Also under her administration, Ohio&#x27;s first state of the art Emergency Operations Center was built, and in 2004, Cleveland became the first city in the country to host the International Children&#x27;s Games. However, Campbell was criticized over her indecision on efforts to build a new city convention center and for her support for the building of a Wal-Mart store at Steelyard Commons. Her relations with City Council President Frank G. Jackson were strained, and she even faced an attempted recall effort.

Ethics of the city government dominated the headlines for much of Campbell&#x27;s term. During Campbell&#x27;s mayoralty, a federal corruption investigation continued from the prior city administration, resulting in subsequent convictions of two of the former Mayor&#x27;s confidantes.

In 2005, Intel named Cleveland as one of the &quot;World’s Digital Communities&quot; in 2005, after Campbell set the stage for using technology as a platform for innovative economic development.

====2005 mayoral election====

On October 4, 2005, after serving one term as mayor, Campbell came in second to City Council President Frank Jackson, in a field of seven candidates in the non-partisan mayoral primary. Only 16% of Cleveland&#x27;s population participated in the primary, the lowest voter turnout in the city&#x27;s history. In the November 8, 2005, general election, Jackson defeated Campbell by 55% to 45%. At 11:25 pm (EST), she conceded to Jackson, who became the city&#x27;s mayor on January 2, 2006.

===Later career===
After leaving office, Campbell accepted a short-term position at Harvard University as part of a fellowship with the Harvard Institute of Politics. Her teaching covered issues in city governance and Ohio politics. She taught at the school during the spring of 2006.

From 2006 to 2009, she served as managing director of public-private partnerships for Colliers Ostendorf-Morris, in Cleveland&#x27;s Colliers International office.

In January 2009, it was announced that Campbell would become chief of staff to Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. She was previously the Director of the Washington Office of the National Development Council (NDC) and President of Women Impacting Public Policy (WIPP).

In 2019, Campbell became the President and CEO of the United States Capitol Historical Society.

== Personal life ==
Campbell was married to urban planner Hunter Morrison, the head of Youngstown State University&#x27;s Office of Campus Planning and Community Partnerships. Campbell and Morrison have two daughters, Jessica and Catherine Campbell-Morrison. The couple divorced in 2008.

<text>A riverboat is a watercraft designed for inland navigation on lakes, rivers, and artificial waterways. They are generally equipped and outfitted as work boats in one of the carrying trades, for freight or people transport, including luxury units constructed for entertainment enterprises, such as lake or harbour tour boats. As larger water craft, virtually all riverboats are especially designed and constructed, or alternatively, constructed with special-purpose features that optimize them as riverine or lake service craft, for instance, dredgers, survey boats, fisheries management craft, fireboats and law enforcement patrol craft.

==Design differences==
Riverboats are usually less sturdy than ships built for the open seas, with limited navigational and rescue equipment, as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves characteristic to large lakes, seas or oceans. They can thus be built from light composite materials. They are limited in size by width and depth of the river as well as the height of bridges spanning the river. They can be designed with shallow drafts, as were the paddle wheel steamers on the Mississippi River that could operate in water under two metres deep.

While a ferry is often used to cross a river, a riverboat is used to travel along the course of the river, while carrying passengers or cargo, or both, for revenue. (Vessels like &#x27;riverboat casinos&#x27; are not considered here, as they are essentially stationary.)

The significance of riverboats is dependent on the number of navigable rivers and channels as well as the condition of the road and rail network. Generally speaking, riverboats provide slow but cheap transport especially suited for bulk cargo and containers.

==History==

As early as 20,000 BC people started fishing in rivers and lakes using rafts and dugouts. Roman sources dated 50 BC mention extensive transportation of goods and people on the river Rhine. Upstream, boats were usually powered by sails or oars. In the Middle Ages, towpaths were built along most waterways to use working animals or people to pull riverboats. In the 19th century, steamboats became common.
The most famous riverboats were on the rivers of the midwestern and central southern United States, on the Mississippi, Ohio and Missouri rivers in the early 19th century. Out west, riverboats were common transportation on the Colorado, Columbia, and Sacramento rivers. These American riverboats were designed to draw very little water, and in fact it was commonly said that they could &quot;navigate on a heavy dew&quot;.
Australia has a history of riverboats. Australia&#x27;s biggest river, the Murray, has an inland port called Echuca. Many large riverboats were working on the Murray, but now a lower water level is stopping them. The Kalgan River in Western Australia has had two main riverboats, the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, 1918 to 1935, would lower her funnel to get under the low bridge. Today, the &quot;Kalgan Queen&quot; riverboat takes tourists up the river to taste the local wines. She lowers her roof to get under the same bridge.

It is these early steam-driven river craft that typically come to mind when &quot;steamboat&quot; is mentioned, as these were powered by burning wood, with iron boilers drafted by a pair of tall smokestacks belching smoke and cinders, and twin double-acting pistons driving a large paddlewheel at the stern, churning foam. This type of propulsion was an advantage as a rear paddlewheel operates in an area clear of snags, is easily repaired, and is not likely to suffer damage in a grounding. By burning wood, the boat could consume fuel provided by woodcutters along the shore of the river. These early boats carried a brow (a short bridge) on the bow, so they could head in to an unimproved shore for transfer of cargo and passengers.

Modern riverboats are generally screw (propeller)-driven, with pairs of diesel engines of several thousand horsepower.

The standard reference for the development of the steamboat is &quot;Steamboats on Western Rivers: An Economic and Technological History&quot; by Louis C. Hunter (1949).

Terrace, British Columbia, Canada, celebrates &quot;Riverboat Days&quot; each summer. The Skeena River passes through Terrace and played a crucial role during the age of the steamboat. The first steam-powered vessel to enter the Skeena was the &quot;Union&quot; in 1864. In 1866 the &quot;Mumford&quot; attempted to ascend the river but was only able to reach the Kitsumkalum River. It was not until 1891 that the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sternwheeler the &quot;Caledonia&quot; successfully negotiated through the Kitselas Canyon and reached Hazelton. A number of other steamers were built around the turn of the century, in part due to the growing fish industry and the gold rush.

The &quot;WT Preston&quot;, a museum ship that was once a specialised river dredge, also called a &quot;snagboat&quot;.

==Modern riverboats==

===Luxury tourist transport===
Some large riverboats are comparable in accommodation, food service, and entertainment to a modern oceanic cruise ship. Tourist boats provide a scenic and relaxing trip through the segment they operate in.

On the Yangtze River, typically employees have double duties: both as serving staff and as evening-costumed dancers.

Smaller luxury craft (without entertainment) operate on European waterways - both rivers and canals, with some providing bicycle and van side trips to smaller villages.

===High-speed passenger transport===
High-speed boats such as those shown here had a special advantage in some operations in the free-running Yangtze. In several locations within the Three Gorges, one-way travel was enforced through fast narrows. While less maneuverable and deeper draft vessels were obliged to wait for clearance, these high-speed boats were free to zip past waiting traffic by running in the shallows.

===Local and low-cost passenger transport===

Smaller riverboats are used in urban and suburban areas for sightseeing and public transport. Sightseeing boats can be found in Amsterdam, Paris, and other touristic cities where historical monuments are located near water.

The concept of local waterborn public transport is known as water taxi in English-speaking countries, vaporetto in Venice, water/river tramway in former Soviet Union and Poland (although sightseeing boats can be called water tramways too). Local waterborne public transport is similar to ferry.

The transport craft shown below is used for short-distance carriage of passengers between villages and small cities along the Yangtze, while larger craft are used for low-cost carriage over longer distance, without the fancy food or shows seen on the tourist riverboats. In some cases, the traveller must provide their own food.

===Goods transport===

====Multimodal====

As the major rivers in China are mostly east-west, most rail and road transport are typically north-south. As roads along the rivers are inadequate for heavy truck transport and in some cases extremely dangerous, drive-on/drive-off ramp barges are used to transport trucks. In many cases the trucks transported are new and are being delivered to customers or dealers. Perhaps unique to China, the new trucks observed traveling upstream were all blue, while the new trucks traveling downstream were all white.

====Bulk cargo====
Low-value goods are transported on rivers and canals worldwide, since slow-speed barge traffic offers the lowest possible cost per ton mile and the capital cost per ton carried is also quite low compared to other modes of transport.

<doc id="835057" wikidata="Q1766888" url="?curid=835057" title="The In-Laws (1979 film)">
<text>The In-Laws is a 1979 American action comedy film starring Alan Arkin and Peter Falk, written by Andrew Bergman and directed by Arthur Hiller. It was filmed on various locations, including Mexico, which served as the film&#x27;s representation of the fictional Central American setting. A remake was made in 2003.

The film focuses on the fathers of a young couple. One of the fathers is a mild-mannered dentist, the other is a renegade agent of the CIA.

==Plot==
The daughter of mild-mannered Manhattan dentist Sheldon &quot;Shelly&quot; Kornpett and the son of businessman Vince Ricardo are engaged to be married. At an introductory dinner in which Shelly meets his new in-law, he finds Vince suspicious; during the dinner, Vince tells a crazy story of a nine-month &quot;consulting&quot; trip to 1954 Guatemala. He excuses himself to make a phone call and hides something in the basement. Later that night, Shelly pleads with his daughter not to marry into the Ricardo clan, but he is talked into giving the marriage a chance.

The following day, Vince appears at Shelly&#x27;s office and asks for help with breaking into his office safe. Shelly reluctantly agrees. After Vince retrieves a black bag from his office in an old Herald Square office building, two armed hit men surprise Shelly. After a chase and shootout, Vince explains that he has worked for the CIA since the Eisenhower administration and robbed the United States Mint of engraving plates to crack a worldwide inflation plot hatched in Central America. He mentions he robbed the U.S. Mint on his own; the CIA had turned him down, deeming the caper too risky. Vince further upsets Shelly by mentioning he left an engraving plate in the basement of Shelly&#x27;s house the previous night.

During the wedding preparations, Mrs. Kornpett discovers the engraving and brings it to her bank, where she is informed by the U.S. Treasury Department that it was stolen. Shelly arrives home to find Treasury officials there and speeds away, leading to a car chase through suburban New Jersey. Vince tells Shelly he wants him to accompany him to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the ordeal will be cleared up by the time they return. At a small airport near Lodi, New Jersey, Vince and Shelly board a jet.

To Shelly&#x27;s consternation, he notices they are flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Vince assures Shelly they are going to Scranton but need to stop in Tijata, a small island south of Honduras. When they arrive, Vince is supposed to meet a corrupt member of the country&#x27;s legislature, General Jesus Braunschweiger. When they land, Jesus is shot and killed. Vince and Shelly fall under sniper fire, escape, and drive into town. At their hotel, Vince contacts the mastermind of the inflation plot, General Garcia.

Shelly calls the United States Embassy and is told by the CIA agent-in-charge that Vince is a madman who was mentally discharged from the agency. Leaving the hotel, Vince hails a taxi driven by one of the airport snipers. Shelly chases, leaping onto the roof of the car. Vince takes control of the car, crashing into a fruit market. Vince and Shelly reach the general&#x27;s estate. The insane general gives them $20 million for the plates, awards them medals, and marches them in front of a firing squad. Vince stalls for time until hundreds of CIA agents, led by Barry Lutz, overwhelm the army and take Garcia into custody. Lutz reveals that Vince was telling the truth. However, Vince retires, as he has had enough. He gives Lutz the $10 million he had agreed to deliver from the general. Vince and Shelly take off with five million dollars each, giving their children a wedding gift of a million dollars each.

==Cast==

In addition, conductor-composer Carmen Dragon makes a cameo appearance.

==Production==
Andrew Bergman says the film began when Warner Bros. approached him saying Alan Arkin and Peter Falk wanted to do a movie together. Bergman said:
I thought immediately, ‘Didn’t they do a movie?’ It’s like, they seemed so perfect for each other! Their personalities, you have a rabbit and a tortoise. You get a hysteric, a person who seems to have no feelings whatsoever ... and I hate constructing plots, hate it more than anything, but I love constructing characters, and this was the perfect thing where the characters were the plot. Whatever Peter said to Alan, that was the plot ... Since my stories are always about people getting in way over their heads ... this movie was the perfect type for me.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Fueled by inspired casting, &quot;The In-Laws&quot; is an odd couple comedy whose clever premise is ably supported by a very funny script.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 69 based on 10 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;Andrew Bergman has written one of those rare comedy scripts that escalates steadily and hilariously, without faltering or even having to strain for an ending. As for Mr. Arkin and Mr. Falk, it is theirs, and not their children&#x27;s, match that has been made in heaven. The teaming of their characters—milquetoast meets entrepreneur—is reminiscent of &#x27;The Producers&#x27;&quot;. Dale Pollock of &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;With &#x27;The In-Laws,&#x27; Warner Bros. should have a first certifiable comedy hit of the summer. The Arthur Hiller-William Sackheim production brims over with laughs, but brand of screenwriter Andrew Bergman&#x27;s humor (previously seen in &#x27;Blazing Saddles&#x27;) may be too wacky for mainstream audiences.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;In a way I feel guilty about knocking &#x27;The In-Laws.&#x27; It&#x27;s an original comedy in a summer movie season full of remakes, sequels, and imitative ripoffs. But if the script had given us more dinner party madness and less slapstick, I might have laughed along with everyone else.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the funniest comedies of the year. This hilarious film, directed by Arthur Hiller and written expressly for Falk and Arkin by Andrew Bergman, wastes not a second in getting laughs.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; dismissed the film as &quot;a heavy-handed, smugly cynical farce.&quot; David Ansen wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;What makes &#x27;The In-Laws&#x27; so engaging is not simply the escalating madness of Andrew Bergman&#x27;s story (such whimsy could easily grow tiresome), but the deadpan counterpoint supplied by the two stars, who navigate their way through mounting disasters with an air of hilariously unjustified rationality. Bergman&#x27;s script was tailor-made for Falk and Arkin, and they make the most of it.&quot;

The CIA showed the film at the base theater at Camp Peary, its Virginia training facility for recruits.

==Remake==
The film was remade in 2003.

<text>La Joute (&quot;the joust&quot;) (1969) is a public sculptural installation by Quebec artist Jean-Paul Riopelle, a member of the Automatiste movement. It is currently located in Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle in the Quartier international de Montréal.

==Design==
The ensemble of bronze sculptures contains a central fountain surrounded by a number of freestanding abstract animal and human figures inside and outside the fountain basin. 

The fountain operates on a kinetic sequence that takes about 32 minutes to complete. It begins a few minutes before the half-hour, every hour from 7 to 11 p.m. during the summer. The sequence starts when the fountain jet expands to form a dome over the sculptures. Then at the back end of the park the grates on the ground start to mist. The 12 grates each mist, one after the other in sequence, taking about 90 seconds to sequence from one to another until they reach the fountain. After about 18 minutes, machines inside the fountain start to produce a particularly dense cloud. The fountain jet then turns into a dribble. On the hour, nozzles in a ring surrounding the central sculpture within the basin shoot up jets of natural gas through the water; these are lit by flame sources installed in the daises of some of the sculptures, producing a dramatic ring of flame. The flame lasts for about seven minutes. The fountain itself stops. The misting stops, and then the fire is &quot;doused&quot; by the fountain which has restarted. The mist sequence, without the fire in the fountain, occurs every hour throughout the day.

==Relocation==
The statue was formerly located in the Parc Olympique, in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district of Montreal. Its relocation to the Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle during the redevelopment of the Quartier international de Montréal in 2003 provoked controversy and outrage from residents of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, who claimed that moving it from the Parc Olympique deprived it of the context required for its full meaning as an homage to sport. 

Those who supported the move, including the Quebec government, Riopelle&#x27;s heirs, and the artwork&#x27;s owner, the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal, argued that moving it would allow a proper homage to Riopelle, and that it would allow the work to be more widely seen and exhibited as the artist intended, whereas its previous location had been inaccessible and had not included the fountain or fire elements Riopelle designed.

In September 2013 a program of renovation was announced, but with no schedule.

<doc id="835132" wikidata="Q46329" url="?curid=835132" title="Stanisław Poniatowski (1754–1833)">
<text>Prince Stanisław Poniatowski (November 23, 1754 – February 13, 1833) was a Polish nobleman, politician, diplomat, a member of the wealthy Poniatowski family and a nephew of the last king of Poland, Stanisław II Augustus. He was the official Commander of the Royal Foot Guards regiment directly responsible for the monarch&#x27;s life as well as the Grand Treasurer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1784–1791) and Governor of Stryj, which made him a key figure in Poland during the Age of Enlightenment.

==Early life==
Stanisław was the son of Apolonia Ustrzycka and Polish Prince Kazimierz Poniatowski (1721–1800). His mother, a daughter of Bazyli Ustrzycki, castellan of Przemyśl, was the widow of Prince Antoni Lubomirski. His father was Deputy Chamberlain of Lithuania (1742–1773), Commander of the Royal Army and a knight of the prestigious Order of the White Eagle, awarded on August 3, 1744 in Warsaw. His father was the brother of the last King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Stanisław II Augustus, who saw in his nephew a possible successor and heir to the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Both Kazimierz and the monarch had been born to Konstancja Czartoryska, (1700–1759), related by marriage to a russophilic Polish–Lithuanian family, the Czartoryskis.

==Career==
Poniatowski became a knight of the White Eagle on December 8, 1773. Very well educated and particularly interested in the finances and economy of the country as well as in the arts, Poniatowski was not popular amongst &quot;szlachta&quot; (the Polish nobility), who found him arrogant and competitive.

Poniatowski commissioned about 2500 engraved gems from a group of gem-engravers in Rome who turned to classical literature for inspiration. In 1830, Poniatowski published a summary catalogue of his gems, &quot;Catalogue des Pierres Gravees Antiques de S.A. le Prince Stanislas Poniatowski&quot;, which contained elaborate descriptions. The collection of Poniatowski gems was sold at a Christie&#x27;s auction in 1839 and has been dispersed ever since.

Following the partitions of Poland, Poniatowski emigrated to Italy, living first in Rome, then in Florence. He is the ancestor of the present members of the Poniatowski family bearing the title of Fürst Poniatowski or Principe Poniatowski di Monterotondo.

==Personal life==

While some sources state that he married Cassandra Luci (Rome, 1785 - Florence, 1863) in 1806, it is unlikely because she was already married to Vicenzo Venturini Benloch. Together, Cassandra and Stanisław were the parents of:

* &quot;Isabella Luci&quot; (Rome, 1806 - Florence, 1896), married firstly in January/February 1821 to Count Prospero Bentivoglio (- 1821), without children, and secondly in 1822 to Count Zanobi di Ricci (- October 16, 1844), their daughter was Marie-Anne Walewska. Then, she married Marquess Filippo De Piccolellis.
* &quot;Carlo Luci&quot; (Rome, 1808 - Florence, 1887), later Poniatowski, legitimized in 1847, made Conte di Monterotondo by the Grand Duke of Tuscany on November 20, 1847, Principe di Monterotondo by the Grand Duke of Tuscany and Prince Poniatowski by the Emperor of Austria both on November 19, 1850 (Rome, August 4, 1808 - San Pancrazio, July 23, 1887), married in Florence, September 21, 1831 to Elisa Napoleone Montecatini (Lucca, November 4, 1808 - Lucca, April 18, 1893), without children.
* &quot;Costanza Luci&quot; (Rome, 1811 - Florence, 1851), married to Count Daniele Zappi.
* &quot;Giuseppe Michele Saverio Francesco Giovanni Luci&quot;(Rome, February 21, 1816 - London, July 4, 1873), later known as Józef Michał Poniatowski, legitimized in 1847, made Conte di Monterotondo by the Grand Duke of Tuscany on November 20, 1847, Principe di Monterotondo by the Grand Duke of Tuscany and Prince Poniatowski by the Emperor of Austria both on November 19, 1850. He was a composer and a singer, and was sent to Paris as plenipotentiary by Grand Duke of Tuscany Leopold II. In 1834, he married Countess Matilda Perotti (1814 - February 1875) in Florence, and they had one son, Stanislaus August Friedrich Joseph Telemach Luci.
* &quot;Michele Luci&quot; (Rome, 1816 - Florence, 1864), founder of &quot;Imparziale fiorentino&quot;.

===Descendants===
Among his descendants are the Princes Poniatowski of the Empire of Austria and Counts and the Princes of Monterotondo in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany

<text>Paul Michael Lyons McStay, (born 22 October 1964) is a Scottish former professional footballer who spent his entire career with Celtic, making his senior debut in 1982 and retiring in 1997. He captained both Scotland and Celtic at all age levels. He was capped 76 times for his country and scored nine goals. He helped Celtic win three league titles, the last in 1988.

==Club career==
As a youth, McStay first came to prominence in June 1980 in a schoolboy international match when Scotland played England at Wembley. Then 15, McStay captained the Scotland team, scored two goals and was awarded Man of the Match after Scotland ran out 5–4 winners.

McStay signed for Celtic aged sixteen from Celtic Boys Club in 1981. He made his first team debut on 23 January 1982 in a 4–0 win over Queen of the South in the Scottish Cup. A week later on 30 January, he made his first league appearance in 3–1 win over Aberdeen at Pittodrie. He scored the third goal, taking a pass from George McCluskey, running through the Aberdeen defence and striking a left foot shot past Jim Leighton in goal.

Season 1982–83 saw the young midfielder establish himself as a first team regular, and he picked up his first winners medal on 4 November 1982 in Celtic&#x27;s 2–1 win over Rangers in the League Cup Final. His performances resulted in media speculation that Inter Milan were considering making a £2 million bid to take him to Italy, a rumour that was emphatically dismissed by the Celtic chairman, Desmond White.

McStay continued to progress at Celtic, and he scored Celtic&#x27;s equaliser in the 1984 Scottish Cup Final against Aberdeen to take the match into extra time. However, Celtic had played most of the match with 10 men after Roy Aitken was sent off in the first half, and Aberdeen scored in extra time to win 2–1.

In December 1987, during Celtic&#x27;s centenary season, McStay signed a five-year contract at Celtic. He went on to enjoy his finest season, winning both the SPFA and Scottish Football Writers player of the year awards as the club won a League and Cup double in 1988.

When Roy Aitken left Celtic Park in 1990, McStay was appointed club captain, a position he retained until his retirement following the 1996–97 season. In his time with the club, Celtic won the League title three times, the Scottish Cup four times and the League Cup once. Although the second half of McStay&#x27;s career coincided with a time when Celtic performed poorly and struggled financially, in 2002 he was voted a member of Celtic&#x27;s greatest ever team by the club&#x27;s fans. He is also a member of the Scotland Football Hall of Fame, which honours the best players to play in Scotland and is located in the Scottish Football Museum.

==International career==
In 1982 he captained Scotland national U19 team to victory in the UEFA European Under-18 Championship, the only major trophy won by any Scotland national team. He captained each of the Scotland teams from under-16 level through under-18, under-20, under-21 and senior level. McStay made his full international debut for Scotland in 1983. He represented Scotland 76 times, including appearances at two World Cups in 1986 and 1990, during a 14-year international career. McStay was also selected for two UEFA European Championships in 1992 and 1996, but withdrew from the latter because of an ankle injury.

==Personal life==
In 2010, McStay moved to live in Sydney, Australia with his wife Anne Marie and their six children. He now runs Maestro Sports, a startup software company specialising in sport coaching and management. McStay attempted to raise $100,000 AUD to fund an autobiography through the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.

McStay&#x27;s great-uncles Jimmy and Willie McStay were former Celtic captains, and his brothers Willie and Raymond also played for Celtic. Their father John worked as a scout for the club.

One of his sons, Chris, has played football for Sutherland Sharks and Rockdale Ilinden in Australia and for Clyde in Scotland. His nephew John (Willie&#x27;s son) played with Celtic Boys Club before moving onto Motherwell under-19s and later played for Ayr United as a defender before becoming a Celtic academy coach.

His cousin Jock McStay played for Raith Rovers during the 1990s, and Jock&#x27;s son Jonny played at Junior level in the 2010s.

<doc id="835151" wikidata="Q366358" url="?curid=835151" title="Jimmie Rodgers">
<text>James Charles Rodgers ( – ) was an American singer-songwriter and musician who rose to popularity in the late 1920s. Widely regarded as the &quot;Father of Country Music&quot;, he is best known for his distinctive yodeling. Rodgers was known as &quot;The Singing Brakeman&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Blue Yodeler&quot;. He has been cited as an inspiration by many artists, and he has been inducted into multiple halls of fame.

Originally from Meridian, Mississippi, Rodgers was the son of railroad worker Aaron Rodgers. During his early childhood the family moved according to the needs of his father&#x27;s employment, or Rodgers&#x27; own poor health. As a teenager he was musically influenced by the diverse vaudeville shows that he often attended. At the age of 13 he won a local singing contest, and then traveled through the Southern United States with a medicine show. After his father took him back home to Meridian, Rodgers dropped out of school and joined the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, beginning as a waterboy on his father&#x27;s gang; he later performed other functions on the railroad, eventually becoming a brakeman. During his time working with different railroad companies, the singer further developed his musical style; he was influenced by the gandy dancers and their impromptu blues performances. Rodgers was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1924. By 1927, as a result of his declining health, he stopped working for the railroad and decided to focus on his music career.

Rodgers joined the Tenneva Ramblers band in 1927, which at the time was working at a radio station. After the band was fired from its spot, it worked in different resorts in the Blue Ridge Mountains. There, Rodgers became aware of the field recordings that Victor Talking Machine Company&#x27;s engineer Ralph Peer was to undertake in Bristol, Tennessee. During what later became known as the Bristol sessions, Rodgers recorded solo, having been deserted by his band after a disagreement. A second session with Rodgers was later arranged in Camden, New Jersey, at the singer&#x27;s own insistence; that session produced &quot;Blue Yodel No. 1 (T for Texas)&quot;. The song became a success, propelling Rodgers to national fame and beginning his recording career with the label, during which he produced over 100 songs.

== Early life ==
The Rodgers family migrated to the United States from England and Ireland before the American Revolution. They settled around the Appalachian Mountains, and later moved to the Southern and Western United States. Both of Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; grandfathers served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. After the war his maternal grandfather settled in Meridian, Mississippi, while his paternal grandfather settled around Geiger, Alabama. Rodgers&#x27; father, Aaron, worked for the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. He eventually became a foreman, and in 1884 he married Eliza Bozeman. The couple lived in the railroad work camps as Aaron Rodgers moved through different locations along the line. The Rodgers family then temporarily settled in the community of Pine Springs, north of Meridian.

Charles James &quot;Jimmie&quot; Rodgers was born on September 8, 1897. His place of birth is disputed: Meridianwhich Rodgers often called his home townis most often listed in records, but he later signed a document that named Geiger, Alabama. Rodgers&#x27; mother, incapable of living in the unsanitary conditions of the camps, decided to stay in Pine Springs, while her husband frequently worked for long periods and returned home when he could. After two miscarriages, her health began to fail. She became sick, and Aaron Rodgers quit his job at the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and began farming, so as to be closer to his wife. She died in 1903. The then-six-year-old Jimmie Rodgers was deeply affected by his mother&#x27;s death. He was sent, along with his brother Talmage, to live with relatives of his father in Scooba, Mississippi, and later to Geiger. Rodgers attended school irregularly during his early childhood; he did not attend at all for a time following the death of his mother. After the family moved to Lowndes County, Mississippi, he and his brother went to school in the town of Artesia. Rodgers and his brother often arrived late to school or missed it altogether as a result of road conditions and other distractions. Rodgers often missed classes during the winter due to his tendency to suffer from colds and respiratory issues.

His father remarried and the family moved to Meridian, where Rodgers was enrolled at the local high school. He and his siblings had problems with their new step-mother. When his father returned to work for the railroad, Rodgers again rarely went to school. Instead, he and his brother Jake went to the local theaters to see vaudeville shows and watch movies. As a result, Rodgers became interested in the entertainment industry. To support his expenditures he sold newspapers and molasses, or he panhandled. In 1906, he was sent to live with his older brother Talmage and their aunt Dora Bozeman in Pine Springs, while his brother Jake was sent to other relatives. The routine of the Bozeman household grounded Rodgers with chores and he spent most of his free time outdoors. He started to attend school regularly and he was further assisted by his teacher, who rented a room at his aunt&#x27;s boarding house. Rodgers received most of his schooling while he lived there until he went back to Meridian in 1911.

Upon his return to Meridian, he went back to the streets. He frequented the barbershop of his uncle Tom Bozeman and he often slept during the daytime in the upstairs apartment. He organized a neighborhood carnival that played the nearby towns. Rodgers&#x27; appearances made enough money to pay for the sheets he used as a tent. He then organized a second show, which he financed with his father&#x27;s money, unbeknownst to him. Rodgers then won a contest at the local Elite Theater for his performance of the songs &quot;Steamboat Bill&quot; and &quot;I Wonder Why Bill Bailey Don&#x27;t Come Home&quot;. Following his success, Rodgers started to perform with a medicine show. He quit the show some weeks later as they reached Birmingham, Alabama, claiming the proprietor did not treat him well. At the age of thirteen, he started working for a tailor in West Blocton, Alabama, until, months later, his father took him back to Meridian with the intention of enrolling him at a new school. Soon afterward, his step-mother died. Instead of attending school, Rodgers followed his father to learn his profession with the working crews of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad.

Rodgers started working for the railroad as a waterboy for the black gandy dancer crews, who introduced him to the railroad jargon, their work songs, and banjo playing. Eventually, he became a baggage handler and then a brakeman. He moved often while working on the lines from Mississippi to Texas. In January 1917, he was introduced by a friend to Stella Kelly in Durant, Mississippi. At that time Rodgers was moving between Jackson and New Orleans without a stable location. He maintained the lines, checked baggage, and at times worked as a dishwasher at a local restaurant in Durant. He and Kelly married on April 6, 1917. The newlyweds left Durant after Rodgers&#x27; job as an apprentice mechanic failed to work out, and moved to Louisville, Mississippi, where he again worked as a brakeman. After his marriage fell apart, he began working for the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad (NO&amp;NE), spending time in both Meridian and New Orleans. He was fired from the NO&amp;NE in 1920, and then worked odd jobs. In the early 1920s he returned to work stints on the railway lines where he had previously worked, as well as on the Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific Railway. He worked mainly as a brakeman, but he also performed other functions, including flagman.

==Music career==
In 1924, Rodgers was diagnosed with tuberculosis at the age of 27. The disease affected his ability to perform his work; following the medical advice of the time, which suggested living in elevated and dry locations to ease the symptoms, he chose to move with his wife and children to Arizona. Then, Rodgers moved to Asheville, North Carolina. As he worked less on the railroads and his foreman complained of his extended absences, he returned to performing music. Rodgers formed a jazz-style band that performed pop standards with the inclusion of horns and the piano accompaniment of his new wife Carrie McWilliams&#x27; sister, Elsie McWilliams. The group played on the road in tents, on city streets and in various other small locations without any commercial success. In 1927, Rodgers left his work on the railroad. In Asheville he met the Grant Brothers, who led the mountain music string band the Tenneva Ramblers. Rodgers convinced the group to join him as the Jimmie Rodgers Entertainers, with him as the lead singer, for a recurrent, unpaid spot he managed to obtain at WWNC. The band was composed of Rodgers (vocals and guitar), Claude Grant (vocals and guitar), Jack Grant (mandolin), Jack Pierce (fiddle) and, at times, Claude Sagle (banjo).

After the group was fired from the radio show, they found a job performing at a resort in the Blue Ridge Mountains. There, Rodgers heard of the upcoming field recordings that engineer Ralph Peer of the Victor Talking Machine Company was to undertake in Bristol, Tennessee, in search of local talent. Rodgers made an appointment for the band to record with Peer on August 4, 1927. Before the scheduled recording, the band had a dispute with the singer regarding the name to be used on the label of the recording. The Tenneva Ramblers then deserted Rodgers, who convinced Peer to record him alone with his guitar. Peer later commented that he considered Rodgers an individualist, who, due to his blues-leaning style, was incompatible with the sound of the Tenneva Ramblers band, which based its music around the use of fiddles. By the end of Rodgers&#x27; session, Peer felt that although he liked the singer, he could not sign him to the label as he was performing pop music that belonged to New York publishers, instead of the original tunes that Peer was scouting for. The session produced &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, an adaptation of an old vaudeville tune with new lyrics by Rodgers, and a version of the showtune, &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot;.

After the session, Peer told Rodgers that he would contact him at a later date to hear new original material. Rodgers then moved with his family to Washington, D.C., and the record sold some copies. After a month of not hearing back from Peer, Rodgers decided to travel to New York City, where he checked into the Manger Hotel and called the producer to let him know that he was ready to undertake his next recording session. Impressed by Rodgers&#x27; boldness, Peer set an appointment for November 30, 1927, at Studio 1 of the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey. The first few numbers that Rodgers tried did not appeal to Peer, as they were once again not original material. Rodgers then attempted a number he had been working on using yodeling, which Peer called &quot;Blue Yodel&quot;.

When &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; / &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot; record started to sell well, Victor decided to advance the release of &quot;Blue Yodel&quot;. In Washington, D.C., Rodgers worked a stint for the station WTTF with the backing of the &quot;Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; Southerners&quot;, while he continued to make records for the label. He used the band for his recordings of &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot; and &quot;The Brakeman&#x27;s Blues&quot;, among others.
As 1928 progressed, &quot;Blue Yodel&quot; became a major success. The song marked the first of a series of blue yodels. The unknown origin of Rodgers&#x27; yodel has been attributed to several sources, including traditional alpine songs, its use by gandy dancers and its use in vaudeville and minstrel shows. The yodels presented a main character who often exaggerated his qualities as a lover, threatening other men who try to take his woman or declaring that he can easily find another one, and vocalizing verses that deal with promiscuity and violence, often using double entendres. With the release of further songs of the series,&quot;Blue Yodel&quot; was later renamed on the catalogs to &quot;Blue Yodel No. 1 (T for Texas)&quot;. &quot;Blue Yodel No. 1&quot; became the singer&#x27;s most successful recording, with over a million copies sold during his lifetime. Soon, Rodgers&#x27; show billed him as &quot;America&#x27;s Blue Yodeler&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;If Brother Jack Were Here&quot;, Victor was threatened with a lawsuit by Joseph W. Stern &amp; Co. for copyright infringement of their original composition &quot;Mother Was a Lady&quot;. As a result, the label renamed the record and Peer began to carefully assess the material brought by Rodgers. The singer often arrived to the recording sessions short of material and he resorted to passing off old vaudeville and minstrel show songs as his own. After Peer rejected several songs, Rodgers contacted his sister-in-law, Elsie McWilliams, to help him with the composition of new material. Few of the songs credited to Rodgers were authored by himself; McWilliams wrote most of his Blue Yodels and Rodgers also hired amateur composers to write other songs. With McWilliams&#x27; help, he would also write compositions of his own, which she remarked Rodgers would not stop working on until they &quot;sounded just right&quot;. With the sales of his records still improving after the release of &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot;, Rodgers embarked on a tour of the United States: he appeared on the Southern Time circuit of Loews Theaters and the East Coast circuit of Publix Theaters. The pairing of &quot;Blue Yodel No. 4 (California Blues)&quot; / &quot;Waiting for a Train&quot; became popular due to the success of the flipside record. The recording would eventually become Rodgers&#x27; second best seller of his career, with a total of 365,000 copies sold during his lifetime.

In February 1929, Rodgers&#x27; health worsened. Against his doctor&#x27;s consistent recommendations to rest, Rodgers proceeded with his tour. During a stop in Meridian, he suffered a fever. Rodgers intended to perform the show, but he collapsed on the dressing room floor shortly before its start. His doctor ordered an x-rayan uncommon procedure at the timeand determined that the singer was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, which affected his lungs. Cavities were found on the top of both lungs, while the bottom of his right lung showed pleurisy. As they traveled through Texas performing, Jimmie and Carrie Rodgers stopped in Kerrville. The town offered the dry air and mild weather that the medical authorities of the time considered necessary for the treatment of tuberculosis. Kerrville was home to multiple sanatoriums and a Veterans Hospital, which specialized in pulmonary disease. As Rodgers was badly affected by the weather in Washington, D.C., Meridian and Asheville, he decided to settle in Kerrville. The construction of his new home began in April 1929. With a total cost of approximately $20,000 (), he named it &quot;Blue Yodeler&#x27;s Paradise&quot;. With his move to Texas, Rodgers&#x27; on-stage attire changed. He had previously worn brakeman&#x27;s working clothes, which he replaced with regular clothes and a cowboy hat. On June 14, 1929, he performed at the inaugural event of San Antonio&#x27;s Majestic Theatre.

At the height of this career, in 1929, Rodgers made approximately $75,000 () in royalties. After the Wall Street Crash that year, while his records continued to sell, his royalties dropped to approximately $60,000 (). &quot;Waiting for a Train&quot; continued to be popular, as the themes depicted in the song became commonplace in the lives of unemployed Americans during the Great Depression. Through a number of field recording sessionsmade as his schedule and tour allowed itRodgers increased his catalog. By November 1929, he had filmed &quot;The Singing Brakeman&quot; at the RCA Victor studios in Camden. Continuing his tour, in late February 1930, Rodgers collapsed again during a stop in Carthage, Mississippi. After he suffered a hemorrhage, Rodgers followed his doctor&#x27;s advice and canceled his third appearance at the local movie house. Despite his condition, Rodgers then joined a four-month tour with daily appearances on &quot;Swain&#x27;s Hollywood Follies&quot;. Rodgers and his musical troupe performed a total of 70 shows. With few of his recordings left to be released, Rodgers headed to Los Angeles to produce new material in June–July 1930. The sessions produced, among other numbers, &quot;Blue Yodel no. 8, Mule Skinner Blues&quot; and &quot;Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standin&#x27; on the Corner)&quot; featuring Louis Armstrong. Rodgers commissioned Ray Hall, at the time a prisoner at the Texas State Penitentiary, to help him write the song &quot;T.B. Blues&quot; after McWilliams refused to help. Rodgers recorded and released the composition in 1931.

In the summer of 1931, Rodgers recorded two sides with the Carter Family. That year, his health quickly deteriorated and his sales fell to an average of 30,000 copies per record as the Great Depression progressed. Meanwhile, his excessive expenditures forced him to sell his Kerrville home. &quot;Rodgers&#x27; Puzzle Record&quot;, a compilation containing three recordings of the singer on one side, was released in England, India, and Australia in 1931. The same year, the singer accepted an offer to make appearances, when available, on San Antonio radio station KMAC&#x27;s Tuesday show. When he was on tour, &quot;The Jimmie Rodgers Show&quot; played his Victor recordings. In April 1932, he renegotiated his contract with the label: Rodgers was to receive $25,000 () for 24 sides to be released monthly, with the singer receiving $250 () in advance payment per side.

===Declining health and death===
As his health condition worsened, Rodgers reduced his appearances on tour schedules from five days to one per venue; he also camped in a tent, which allowed for better air circulation. A number of concerts were cut short because of his condition, while others were cancelled. Until 1932, Peer took trips for field sessions to record Rodgers in Atlanta, New Orleans and Dallas. After RCA Victor ended his field sessions, Rodgers traveled to Camden, to record at the company&#x27;s studios. Rodgers managed to produce ten sides, with regular rest between takes. Realizing the state of health of the singer, Peer arranged a follow-up session to create a backlog for the Rodgers catalog. Rodgers then returned to San Antonio, where he spent most of his time in bed until, in October of that year, he resumed his appearances on the local radio station. In the early winter of 1932, he made appearances throughout East Texas until he collapsed during a show in Lufkin and was placed in an oxygen tent. He then stopped performing at KMAC and stayed at home while he arranged a new recording session with Peer for May.

Rodgers and his personal nurse, Cora Bedell, traveled to New York City on the SS &quot;Mohawk&quot; and arrived on May 14, 1933. Peer left the singer to rest at his usual lodging, the Taft Hotel (earlier The Manger), for a few days before the session. Meanwhile, he assigned Rodgers a driver, known as Castro. The recording session, with Fred Maisch engineering, began on May 17 at RCA Victor&#x27;s New York Studios at 153 E 24th Street. During the first two days, Rodgers recorded six numbers. The singer sat on an easy chair and was propped up by pillows to reach the microphone; the sessions were often paused as a result of his health. A new session was scheduled for May 24, 1933. Rodgers produced four songs and lay on a cot between takes. At the end of the day, he was helped into a cab and returned to his hotel. The next day, he recovered and then visited Coney Island with his driver. When returning, Rodgers decided to walk the last few blocks to the hotel, but he needed help to return to his room. He then suffered an intense cough, which eventually stopped. At midnight, he resumed coughing and began to hemorrhage. The hotel&#x27;s doctor could not be found and Castro, who was out on an errand, returned too late to take him to a hospital. Rodgers fell in a coma and he died soon after.

Rodgers&#x27; pearl-gray casket was placed on a raised platform covered in lilies in a baggage car and taken back to Meridian by the Southern Railway on a trip operated by former workmates of Rodgers. On May 29, 1933, his body lay in state at the local Scottish Rite Cathedral. That afternoon, escorted by members of the Scottish Rite, the Hamasa Shrine Temple and the Knights of Pythias, his body was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery. During his lifetime, Rodgers reinvigorated the deflated sales record market for RCA Victor, and, despite the drop of sales during the depression, his records continued to sell well. At the time of his death, his sales represented 10% of the total for the label.

==Style and image==
Rodgers recalled his earliest memories of playing the guitar upon returning from picking cotton during his childhood. Although he performed with the instrument for many years, he only knew a few chords, which he complemented with a flatpicking technique. As he worked on the railroads through the late 1910s and the 1920s, he developed his style of music and singing. His material was based on classic Anglo-Celtic storytelling and ballad singing and black blues heavily influenced him. Ethnomusicologist Norm Cohen defined five categories for the 112 recordings that make up Rodgers&#x27; catalog: &quot;19th century sentimental ballads&quot;, vaudevillian novelty songs, blues songs, traditional folk songs and &quot;contemporary hillbilly songs&quot;. Rodgers&#x27; releases included collaborations with artists ranging from jazz performers to Hawaiian musicians.
Instead of the 3/4 time present in traditional alpine folk music, Rodgers&#x27; yodel featured a 4/4 time. Rodgers developed his yodel through his early music career; he was likely influenced by several vaudevillian performers or by the recordings and live performances of Emmett Miller. From the gandy dancers, Rodgers learned to elongate or shorten words to fit the metric of a song. He also carried a banjo or a guitar with him as he worked on the railroads. His live performances and recordings included the use of spoken remarks between verses to encourage his musicians, or exclamations when he played alone. Additionally, Rodgers developed a train whistle noise, which he made with the back of his throat through a mixture of a yodel and a whistle.

During his early appearances, Rodgers donned a bowler hat with a suit and a tie in the style of vaudevillian performers. When he was later billed as &quot;The Singing Brakeman&quot;, Rodgers added railroad worker attire to his stage wardrobe. After he moved to Texas, he started to wear cowboy hats and western clothes, similar to the singing cowboys which were becoming popular in Western films. Rodgers would ultimately decide which clothes he would wear for a performance according to the audience he was expecting.

==Personal life==

Rodgers married Stella Kelly on May 1, 1917, when they were both 19 years old. They separated soon after due to what Kelly later described as Rodgers&#x27; tendency to procrastinate and drink, and his lack of ambition. She believed that Rodgers spent too much money and that by playing music he &quot;fool away his time and money&quot;. After two years of living apart, their divorce became final in November 1919. Rodgers then married Carrie Williamson on April 7, 1920. Their first daughter, Anita, was born in January 1921. June, their second child, was born in 1923, but she died in December of that year. To return in time for her funeral and Christmas, Rodgers had to pawn his banjo. Both of his wives complained of Rodgers&#x27; excessive expenditures, and later his lavish lifestyle. Rodgers resorted to drinking to ease the pain caused by his tuberculosis.

On June 9, 1932, Rodgers lost a paternity lawsuit to his former wife Stella. She alleged that Rodgers was the father of her daughter, Kathryn Rodgers, who was born in February 1918. Although there was no conclusive evidence that Rodgers had slept with Kelly at the time of the child&#x27;s conception, judge Edgar Vaught held that she was conceived in legal wedlock. Rodgers was ordered to pay $50 monthly () in child support until Kathryn reached 18 years of age. After Rodgers&#x27; death, the monthly support from his estate stopped when Stella re-married. Kathryn Rodgers died soon after, in 1938.

Rodgers was a Freemason. He was inducted to the order in Meridian on August 9, 1920. In 1930, he joined the Elks lodge. In 1931, he reached the rank of Master Mason in Meridian. That year, he was moved to the San Antonio Scottish Rite Cathedral and received the local degree. He was also associated with the Alzafar Temple. In 1931, Rodgers was invited to Austin, Texas, and named an honorary Texas Ranger. To commemorate the occasion, the singer would later release the song &quot;The Yodeling Ranger&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Influence===
Rodgers is considered the &quot;Father of Country Music&quot;. The Country Music Hall of Fame inducted Rodgers among the inaugural class of 1961. According to the Hall of Fame, Rodgers &quot;brought to the emerging genre of &#x27;hillbilly music&#x27; a distinctive, colorful personality and a rousing vocal style&quot; that &quot;created and defined the role of the singing star in country music&quot;. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Rodgers as an early influence with the class of 1986. Rodgers was inducted by Jerry Wexler, as the Hall of Fame determined that the genre &quot;owes an immeasurable debt&quot; to the singer, and that, despite being a country music singer, &quot;his fusion of blues, Appalachian ballads and spirituals was an early framework for rock and roll&quot; that influenced &quot;everyone from Bob Dylan to Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot;. The Blues Hall of Fame wrote about Rodgers induction: &quot;His reworkings of the blues not only helped popularize the music with white audiences but were also performed by many singers from the African American community that produced the blues that inspired Rodgers in the first place&quot;. Rodgers was the first artist inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970 for his influence in artists of &quot;every genre&quot; through music that &quot;fused hillbilly, gospel, blues, jazz, pop and mountain folk music into timeless American standards&quot;. That same year, he was inducted to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. The entry on Rodgers remarked on his &quot;undying&quot; influence on multiple generations of musicians. He was also inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Blue Ridge Music Hall of Fame in 1993 and 2018 respectively.

For Encyclopædia Britannica, Rodgers&#x27; legacy made him &quot;one of the principal figures in the emergence of the country and western style of popular music&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed Rodgers at number 11 on its 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time list, and at number 88 on their 200 Greatest Singers of All Time list. &quot;Allmusic&quot; has described Rodgers as &quot;the first nationally known star of country music&quot;, noted his influence on later musicians and declared that the singer &quot;affected the history of country music by making it a viable, commercially popular medium&quot;.

Country singers Gene Autry and Jimmie Davis, as well as western swing singer Tommy Duncan, were heavily influenced by Rodgers. Autry, Davis and Duncan recorded multiple songs of his repertoire, including yodeling tracks, until they changed their styles to avoid being deemed imitators. As a teenager, Hank Snow heard Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Moonlight and Skies&quot; on the radio. Snow started to imitate Rodgers&#x27; guitar playing and singing style, and he would later credit him as his one major influence. &quot;Moonlight and Skies&quot; was one of his most popular songs in many parts of the country. Ernest Tubb also considered Rodgers to be his greatest influence. Early in his career, Tubb kept a picture of Rodgers, which at one point became worn out. He then decided to call Rodgers&#x27; widow to obtain a new copy. Carrie Rodgers invited him and his family to her home. Eventually, she decided to help Tubb with his career: they recorded a duet of the tribute song &quot;We Miss Him When the Evening Shadows Fall&quot; and Carrie presented Tubb with Rodgers&#x27; guitar as a gift. Robert Johnson&#x27;s step-sister, Annye, remembered Rodgers as their favorite country singer. Johnson played &quot;Waiting for a Train&quot; and imitated Rodgers&#x27; yodel. Other artists that have acknowledged influence by Rodgers include Lefty Frizzell, Roy Rogers, Eddy Arnold, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Lynyrd Skynyrd, John Fahey, and Alison Krauss. Rodgers&#x27; appearance on &quot;The Singing Brakeman&quot; is considered one of the first music videos.

In South Africa, Rodgers&#x27; records were distributed by Regal Zonophone Records. In his autobiography, &quot;Down Second Avenue&quot;, writer Es&#x27;kia Mphahlele described about his memories of young men bringing gramophones and Rodgers&#x27; records from Pretoria, and how his music could be heard on Christmas Day throughout his village. Rodgers&#x27; records sold particularly well in Durban, a city mostly populated by the Zulu. In 1930, singers Griffiths Motsieloa and Ignatius Monare recorded their version of a blue yodel in Zulu language, entitled &quot;Aubuti Nkikho&quot;, in London. In 1932, William Mseleku recorded &quot;Eku Hambeni&quot; and &quot;Sifikile Tina&quot;. The songs were inspired by Rodgers&#x27; style and recorded in Zulu. Rodgers influenced several Zimbabwean acoustic guitarists of the 1940s, who had heard records imported from South Africa, including Chinemberi, Mattaka, Jacob Mhungu and Jeremiah Kainga. Local artists developed a two-finger playing style that used the thumb and first finger to emulate the sound of the singer and they frequently used yodels. Recordings of Rodgers were taken to the Great Rift Valley of Kenya by English missionaries who lived among the Kipsigis people. The tribe sang about Rodgers in a traditional song recorded in 1950 by ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey who later named it &quot;Chemirocha III&quot;.

===Tributes===
In January 1935, Grand Ole Opry artists the Delmore Brothers and Uncle Dave Macon stopped on their way to New Orleans to visit Rodgers&#x27; brother Talmage and his wife in Meridian to play a tribute song called &quot;Blue Railroad Train&quot;. That same year, Rodgers&#x27; widow published a biographical book: &quot;My Husband, Jimmie Rodgers&quot;. On May 16, 1953, the first Jimmie Rodgers Memorial Festival was held in Meridian. The festival featured appearances by country music singers and other entertainers who were influenced by Rodgers, as well as his family members. The festival was celebrated in an intermittent fashion until it became a recurring event starting in 1972. Attendees at the first event included Carrie Rodgers, Elsie McWilliams, Ralph Peer, Hugh L. White, Frank G. Clement, railroad representatives, Mary Jones (the wife of engineer Casey Jones) and Lillie Williams (Hank Williams&#x27; mother). Several performers who were influenced by Rodgers were present, including 25 Grand Ole Opry artists led by Ernest Tubb and Hank Snow. The show attracted a crowd of 30,000. A granite monument to Rodgers was unveiled, as well as a static locomotive as a memorial to the deceased railroad workers of Meridian.

On May 24, 1978, the United States Postal Service issued a 13-cent commemorative stamp honoring Rodgers, the first in its long-running Performing Arts Series. The stamp was designed by Jim Sharpe and depicted Rodgers with brakeman&#x27;s outfit and guitar, standing in front of a locomotive giving his famous &quot;two thumbs up&quot; gesture. The 1982 film &quot;Honkytonk Man&quot;, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, was loosely based on Rodgers&#x27; life. In 1997, Bob Dylan put together a tribute compilation of major artists covering Rodgers&#x27; songs, &quot;The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers: A Tribute&quot;. The artists included Bono, Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station, Jerry Garcia, Dickey Betts, Dwight Yoakam, Aaron Neville, John Mellencamp, Willie Nelson and others. In 2004, Steve Forbert&#x27;s tribute album &quot;Any Old Time&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album. In 2007, Rodgers was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in his hometown of Meridian, the first outside of the Mississippi Delta. In May 2010, a marker on the Mississippi Country Music Trail was erected near Rodgers&#x27; grave site. The Elton John and Leon Russell 2010 collaboration &quot;The Union&quot; featured the tribute &quot;Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; Dream&quot;. In 2013, a North Carolina historical marker was dedicated on Haywood Street in Asheville.

<text>Adhesion is the tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another. (Cohesion refers to the tendency of similar or identical particles and surfaces to cling to one another.)

The forces that cause adhesion and cohesion can be divided into several types. The intermolecular forces responsible for the function of various kinds of stickers and sticky tape fall into the categories of chemical adhesion, dispersive adhesion, and diffusive adhesion. In addition to the cumulative magnitudes of these intermolecular forces, there are also certain emergent mechanical effects.

== Surface energy ==
Surface energy is conventionally defined as the work that is required to build an area of a particular surface. Another way to view the surface energy is to relate it to the work required to cleave a bulk sample, creating two surfaces. If the new surfaces are identical, the surface energy γ of each surface is equal to half the work of cleavage, W: γ = (1/2)W11.

If the surfaces are unequal, the Young-Dupré equation applies:
W12 = γ1 + γ2 – γ12, where γ1 and γ2 are the surface energies of the two new surfaces, and γ12 is the interfacial energy.

This methodology can also be used to discuss cleavage that happens in another medium: γ12 = (1/2)W121 = (1/2)W212. These two energy quantities refer to the energy that is needed to cleave one species into two pieces while it is contained in a medium of the other species. Likewise for a three species system: γ13 + γ23 – γ12 = W12 + W33 – W13 – W23 = W132, where W132 is the energy of cleaving species 1 from species 2 in a medium of species 3.

A basic understanding of the terminology of cleavage energy, surface energy, and surface tension is very helpful for understanding the physical state and the events that happen at a given surface, but as discussed below, the theory of these variables also yields some interesting effects that concern the practicality of adhesive surfaces in relation to their surroundings.

==Mechanisms==
There is no single theory covering adhesion, and particular mechanisms are specific to particular material scenarios.
Five mechanisms of adhesion have been proposed to explain why one material sticks to another:

===Mechanical===
Adhesive materials fill the voids or pores of the surfaces and hold surfaces together by interlocking. Other interlocking phenomena are observed on different length scales. Sewing is an example of two materials forming a large scale mechanical bond, velcro forms one on a medium scale, and some textile adhesives (glue) form one at a small scale.

===Chemical===
Two materials may form a compound at the joint. The strongest joints are where atoms of the two materials share or swap electrons (known respectively as covalent bonding or ionic bonding). A weaker bond is formed if a hydrogen atom in one molecule is attracted to an atom of nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine in another molecule, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding.

Chemical adhesion occurs when the surface atoms of two separate surfaces form ionic, covalent, or hydrogen bonds. The engineering principle behind chemical adhesion in this sense is fairly straightforward: if surface molecules can bond, then the surfaces will be bonded together by a network of these bonds. It bears mentioning that these attractive ionic and covalent forces are effective over only very small distances – less than a nanometer. This means in general not only that surfaces with the potential for chemical bonding need to be brought very close together, but also that these bonds are fairly brittle, since the surfaces then need to be kept close together.

===Dispersive===
In dispersive adhesion, also known as physisorption, two materials are held together by van der Waals forces: the attraction between two molecules, each of which has a region of slight positive and negative charge. In the simple case, such molecules are therefore polar with respect to average charge density, although in larger or more complex molecules, there may be multiple &quot;poles&quot; or regions of greater positive or negative charge. These positive and negative poles may be a permanent property of a molecule (Keesom forces) or a transient effect which can occur in any molecule, as the random movement of electrons within the molecules may result in a temporary concentration of electrons in one region (London forces).


In surface science, the term &quot;adhesion&quot; almost always refers to dispersive adhesion. In a typical solid-liquid-gas system (such as a drop of liquid on a solid surrounded by air) the contact angle is used to evaluate adhesiveness indirectly, while a Centrifugal Adhesion Balance allows for direct quantitative adhesion measurements. Generally, cases where the contact angle is low are considered of higher adhesion per unit area. This approach assumes that the lower contact angle corresponds to a higher surface energy. Theoretically, the more exact relation between contact angle and work of adhesion is more involved and is given by the Young-Dupre equation. The contact angle of the three-phase system is a function not only of dispersive adhesion (interaction between the molecules in the liquid and the molecules in the solid) but also cohesion (interaction between the liquid molecules themselves). Strong adhesion and weak cohesion results in a high degree of wetting, a lyophilic condition with low measured contact angles. Conversely, weak adhesion and strong cohesion results in lyophobic conditions with high measured contact angles and poor wetting.

London dispersion forces are particularly useful for the function of adhesive devices, because they do not require either surface to have any permanent polarity. They were described in the 1930s by Fritz London, and have been observed by many researchers. Dispersive forces are a consequence of statistical quantum mechanics. London theorized that attractive forces between molecules that cannot be explained by ionic or covalent interaction can be caused by polar moments within molecules. Multipoles could account for attraction between molecules having permanent multipole moments that participate in electrostatic interaction. However, experimental data showed that many of the compounds observed to experience van der Waals forces had no multipoles at all. London suggested that momentary dipoles are induced purely by virtue of molecules being in proximity to one another. By solving the quantum mechanical system of two electrons as harmonic oscillators at some finite distance from one another, being displaced about their respective rest positions and interacting with each other&#x27;s fields, London showed that the energy of this system is given by:

:formula_1

While the first term is simply the zero-point energy, the negative second term describes an attractive force between neighboring oscillators. The same argument can also be extended to a large number of coupled oscillators, and thus skirts issues that would negate the large scale attractive effects of permanent dipoles cancelling through symmetry, in particular.

The additive nature of the dispersion effect has another useful consequence. Consider a single such dispersive dipole, referred to as the origin dipole. Since any origin dipole is inherently oriented so as to be attracted to the adjacent dipoles it induces, while the other, more distant dipoles are not correlated with the original dipole by any phase relation (thus on average contributing nothing), there is a net attractive force in a bulk of such particles. When considering identical particles, this is called cohesive force.

When discussing adhesion, this theory needs to be converted into terms relating to surfaces. If there is a net attractive energy of cohesion in a bulk of similar molecules, then cleaving this bulk to produce two surfaces will yield surfaces with a dispersive surface energy, since the form of the energy remain the same. This theory provides a basis for the existence of van der Waals forces at the surface, which exist between any molecules having electrons. These forces are easily observed through the spontaneous jumping of smooth surfaces into contact. Smooth surfaces of mica, gold, various polymers and solid gelatin solutions do not stay apart when their separating becomes small enough – on the order of 1–10 nm. The equation describing these attractions was predicted in the 1930s by De Boer and Hamaker:

:formula_2

where P is the force (negative for attraction), z is the separation distance, and A is a material-specific constant called the Hamaker constant.

The effect is also apparent in experiments where a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp is made with small periodic post structures. The surface with the posts is placed face down on a smooth surface, such that the surface area in between each post is elevated above the smooth surface, like a roof supported by columns. Because of these attractive dispersive forces between the PDMS and the smooth substrate, the elevated surface – or &quot;roof&quot; – collapses down onto the substrate without any external force aside from the van der Waals attraction. Simple smooth polymer surfaces – without any microstructures – are commonly used for these dispersive adhesive properties. Decals and stickers that adhere to glass without using any chemical adhesives are fairly common as toys and decorations and useful as removable labels because they do not rapidly lose their adhesive properties, as do sticky tapes that use adhesive chemical compounds.

These forces also act over very small distances – 99% of the work necessary to break van der Waals bonds is done once surfaces are pulled more than a nanometer apart. As a result of this limited motion in both the van der Waals and ionic/covalent bonding situations, practical effectiveness of adhesion due to either or both of these interactions leaves much to be desired. Once a crack is initiated, it propagates easily along the interface because of the brittle nature of the interfacial bonds.

As an additional consequence, increasing surface area often does little to enhance the strength of the adhesion in this situation. This follows from the aforementioned crack failure – the stress at the interface is not uniformly distributed, but rather concentrated at the area of failure.

===Electrostatic===

Some conducting materials may pass electrons to form a difference in electrical charge at the joint. This results in a structure similar to a capacitor and creates an attractive electrostatic force between the materials.

===Diffusive===
Some materials may merge at the joint by diffusion. This may occur when the molecules of both materials are mobile and soluble in each other. This would be particularly effective with polymer chains where one end of the molecule diffuses into the other material. It is also the mechanism involved in sintering. When metal or ceramic powders are pressed together and heated, atoms diffuse from one particle to the next. This joins the particles into one.
Diffusive forces are somewhat like mechanical tethering at the molecular level. Diffusive bonding occurs when species from one surface penetrate into an adjacent surface while still being bound to the phase of their surface of origin. One instructive example is that of polymer-on-polymer surfaces. Diffusive bonding in polymer-on-polymer surfaces is the result of sections of polymer chains from one surface interdigitating with those of an adjacent surface. The freedom of movement of the polymers has a strong effect on their ability to interdigitate, and hence, on diffusive bonding. For example, cross-linked polymers are less capable of diffusion and interdigitation because they are bonded together at many points of contact, and are not free to twist into the adjacent surface. Uncrosslinked polymers (thermoplastics), on the other hand are freer to wander into the adjacent phase by extending tails and loops across the interface.

Another circumstance under which diffusive bonding occurs is &quot;scission&quot;. Chain scission is the cutting up of polymer chains, resulting in a higher concentration of distal tails. The heightened concentration of these chain ends gives rise to a heightened concentration of polymer tails extending across the interface. Scission is easily achieved by ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of oxygen gas, which suggests that adhesive devices employing diffusive bonding actually benefit from prolonged exposure to heat/light and air. The longer such a device is exposed to these conditions, the more tails are scissed and branch out across the interface.

Once across the interface, the tails and loops form whatever bonds are favorable. In the case of polymer-on-polymer surfaces, this means more van der Waals forces. While these may be brittle, they are quite strong when a large network of these bonds is formed. The outermost layer of each surface plays a crucial role in the adhesive properties of such interfaces, as even a tiny amount of interdigitation – as little as one or two tails of 1.25 angstrom length – can increase the van der Waals bonds by an order of magnitude.

==Strength==
The strength of the adhesion between two materials depends on which of the above mechanisms occur between the two materials, and the surface area over which the two materials contact. Materials that wet against each other tend to have a larger contact area than those that do not. Wetting depends on the surface energy of the materials.

Low surface energy materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene and polyoxymethylene are difficult to bond without special surface preparation.

Another factor determining the strength of an adhesive contact is its shape. Adhesive contacts of complex shape begin to detach at the &quot;edges&quot; of the contact area. The process of destruction of adhesive contacts can be seen in the film.

==Other effects==
In concert with the primary surface forces described above, there are several circumstantial effects in play. While the forces themselves each contribute to the magnitude of the adhesion between the surfaces, the following play a crucial role in the overall strength and reliability of an adhesive device.

===Stringing===
Stringing is perhaps the most crucial of these effects, and is often seen on adhesive tapes. Stringing occurs when a separation of two surfaces is beginning and molecules at the interface bridge out across the gap, rather than cracking like the interface itself. The most significant consequence of this effect is the restraint of the crack. By providing the otherwise brittle interfacial bonds with some flexibility, the molecules that are stringing across the gap can stop the crack from propagating. Another way to understand this phenomenon is by comparing it to the stress concentration at the point of failure mentioned earlier. Since the stress is now spread out over some area, the stress at any given point has less of a chance of overwhelming the total adhesive force between the surfaces. If failure does occur at an interface containing a viscoelastic adhesive agent, and a crack does propagate, it happens by a gradual process called &quot;fingering&quot;, rather than a rapid, brittle fracture.
Stringing can apply to both the diffusive bonding regime and the chemical bonding regime. The strings of molecules bridging across the gap would either be the molecules that had earlier diffused across the interface or the viscoelastic adhesive, provided that there was a significant volume of it at the interface.

===Microstructures===
The interplay of molecular scale mechanisms and hierarchical surface structures is known to result in high levels of static friction and bonding between pairs of surfaces. Technologically advanced adhesive devices sometimes make use of microstructures on surfaces, such as tightly packed periodic posts. These are biomimetic technologies inspired by the adhesive abilities of the feet of various arthropods and vertebrates (most notably, geckos). By intermixing periodic breaks into smooth, adhesive surfaces, the interface acquires valuable crack-arresting properties. Because crack initiation requires much greater stress than does crack propagation, surfaces like these are much harder to separate, as a new crack has to be restarted every time the next individual microstructure is reached.

===Hysteresis===
Hysteresis, in this case, refers to the restructuring of the adhesive interface over some period of time, with the result being that the work needed to separate two surfaces is greater than the work that was gained by bringing them together (W &gt; γ1 + γ2). For the most part, this is a phenomenon associated with diffusive bonding. The more time is given for a pair of surfaces exhibiting diffusive bonding to restructure, the more diffusion will occur, the stronger the adhesion will become. The aforementioned reaction of certain polymer-on-polymer surfaces to ultraviolet radiation and oxygen gas is an instance of hysteresis, but it will also happen over time without those factors.

In addition to being able to observe hysteresis by determining if W &gt; γ1 + γ2 is true, one can also find evidence of it by performing &quot;stop-start&quot; measurements. In these experiments, two surfaces slide against one another continuously and occasionally stopped for some measured amount of time. Results from experiments on polymer-on-polymer surfaces show that if the stopping time is short enough, resumption of smooth sliding is easy. If, however, the stopping time exceeds some limit, there is an initial increase of resistance to motion, indicating that the stopping time was sufficient for the surfaces to restructure.

===Wettability and absorption===
Some atmospheric effects on the functionality of adhesive devices can be characterized by following the theory of surface energy and interfacial tension. It is known that γ12 = (1/2)W121 = (1/2)W212. If γ12 is high, then each species finds it favorable to cohere while in contact with a foreign species, rather than dissociate and mix with the other. If this is true, then it follows that when the interfacial tension is high, the force of adhesion is weak, since each species does not find it favorable to bond to the other. The interfacial tension of a liquid and a solid is directly related to the liquid&#x27;s wettability (relative to the solid), and thus one can extrapolate that cohesion increases in non-wetting liquids and decreases in wetting liquids. One example that verifies this is polydimethyl siloxane rubber, which has a work of self-adhesion of 43.6 mJ/m2 in air, 74 mJ/m2 in water (a nonwetting liquid) and 6 mJ/m2 in methanol (a wetting liquid).

This argument can be extended to the idea that when a surface is in a medium with which binding is favorable, it will be less likely to adhere to another surface, since the medium is taking up the potential sites on the surface that would otherwise be available to adhere to another surface. Naturally this applies very strongly to wetting liquids, but also to gas molecules that could adsorb onto the surface in question, thereby occupying potential adhesion sites. This last point is actually fairly intuitive: Leaving an adhesive exposed to air too long gets it dirty, and its adhesive strength will decrease. This is observed in the experiment: when mica is cleaved in air, its cleavage energy, W121 or Wmica/air/mica, is smaller than the cleavage energy in vacuum, Wmica/vac/mica, by a factor of 13.

===Lateral adhesion===
Lateral adhesion is associated with sliding one object on a substrate, such as sliding a drop on a surface. When the two objects are solids, either with or without a liquid between them, the lateral adhesion is described as &quot;friction&quot;. However, the behavior of lateral adhesion between a drop and a surface is tribologically very different from friction between solids, and the naturally adhesive contact between a flat surface and a liquid drop makes the lateral adhesion in this case, an individual field. Lateral adhesion can be measured using the centrifugal adhesion balance (CAB), which uses a combination of centrifugal and gravitational forces to decouple the normal and lateral forces in the problem.

<text>Thomas Boyd (born 24 November 1965) is a Scottish former professional footballer. He played for Motherwell, Chelsea and Celtic, and appeared 72 times for Scotland, which means he is a member of the Scottish FA International Roll of Honour. Boyd now works in the hospitality area at Celtic Park.

==Club career==

===Motherwell===
Boyd&#x27;s professional career began at Motherwell, where he made 252 league appearances. The most notable of his achievements in his time at Fir Park was skippering the &quot;Well&quot; side that defeated Dundee United 4–3 in the 1991 Scottish Cup final, considered one of the most exciting in the competition&#x27;s history.

===Chelsea===
Boyd&#x27;s form as an attacking full back saw him win a move to Chelsea that year. However, Boyd struggled to settle and spent only one year at Stamford Bridge.

===Celtic===
Boyd was transferred to boyhood heroes Celtic in an exchange deal which saw Tony Cascarino going to Chelsea. He played for Celtic for the remainder of his career, serving as club captain from 1997 to 2002. He holds the distinction of having been the captain who lifted Celtic&#x27;s first league title in ten years in 1998, preventing rivals Rangers from securing a record-breaking ten championships in a row.

As Boyd&#x27;s career moved on, he began playing more in the centre of defence, whilst continuing to operate at full back on either side of the pitch when required, making him a versatile defender. Boyd continued to captain the club after the arrival of Martin O&#x27;Neill at Celtic Park in 2000. In O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first season in charge Boyd played a significant part in the securing of a domestic treble, only the third in the club&#x27;s history; Boyd became only the second Celtic captain (after Billy McNeill) to captain Celtic in a treble-winning season. He also helped them win another Scottish Premier League title in 2001–02.

===International career===
Boyd is the sixth most capped player for Scotland with 72 caps, meaning that he is a member of the Scotland national football team roll of honour and can be found in the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden Park. His international career saw him garner 72 Scotland caps, playing at UEFA Euro 1992 and UEFA Euro 1996 and also the 1998 World Cup. In the latter tournament, he scored an own goal in a match against Brazil when the ball deflected off him as he ran back facing his goalkeeper, giving the Brazilians a 2–1 win in the tournament&#x27;s opening match.

==Post-playing career==
Boyd retired from playing in 2003, but has remained working with Celtic. In 2016, he was named along with Davie Hay as new ambassadors of the club, joining Billy McNeill (who was named an ambassador in 2009) in this role. He has also participated in several charity events such as the Tommy Burns Tribute match and climbing Ben Nevis.

<doc id="835175" wikidata="Q1689292" url="?curid=835175" title="Jimmie Rodgers (pop singer)">
<text>James Frederick Rodgers (September 18, 1933 – January 18, 2021) was an American pop singer. Rodgers had a run of hits and mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. His string of crossover singles ranked highly on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles, Hot Country and Western Sides, and Hot Rhythm and Blues Sides charts; in the 1960s, Rodgers had more modest successes with adult contemporary music.

He was not related to country music pioneer Jimmie C. Rodgers (1897–1933), who died the same year the younger Rodgers was born. Among country audiences, and in his official songwriting credits, the younger Rodgers, Jimmie Frederick, was often credited as Jimmie F. Rodgers to differentiate the two.

==Career==
===Early years===
Rodgers was born in Camas, Washington. He was the second son of Archie and Mary Rodgers. Rodgers was taught music by his mother, a piano teacher, and began performing as a child, first entertaining at a Christmas show when he was only five. He learned to play the piano and guitar, and performed locally.

After attending Camas High School, he briefly took courses at Clark College in Vancouver, Washington. He later went to work at the Crown Zellerbach paper mill in Camas. Although he loved music, he was uncertain whether he could turn it into a career. He was subsequently drafted and served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.

=== 1950s ===
While in the Air Force, Rodgers joined a band named The Melodies started by violinist Phil Clark. During his service, he was transferred to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was stationed at Sewart Air Force Base from 1954 to 1956. It was during this time that he began expanding his musical repertoire. While he was in Nashville, he first heard &quot;Honeycomb&quot;, the song that became his first hit.

Like a number of other entertainers of the era, he was one of the contestants on Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s talent show on CBS television, winning $700. Producers Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore saw Rodgers perform and signed him to a recording contract with Morris Levy&#x27;s company, Roulette Records.

In the summer of 1957, Rodgers recorded his version of &quot;Honeycomb&quot;, written by Bob Merrill and recorded by Georgie Shaw three years earlier. The tune was Rodgers&#x27; biggest hit, staying on the top of the charts for four weeks. It sold over 1 million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Over the following year, he had a number of other hits that reached the top 10 on the charts: &quot;Kisses Sweeter than Wine&quot;; &quot;Oh-Oh, I&#x27;m Falling in Love Again&quot;; &quot;Secretly&quot;; and &quot;Are You Really Mine?&quot;. Other hits include &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, &quot;Bimbombey&quot;, &quot;Ring-a-ling-a-lario&quot;, &quot;Tucumcari&quot;, &quot;Tender Love and Care (T.L.C)&quot;, and a version of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; as a film tie-in with the apocalyptic movie &quot;On the Beach&quot; in 1959.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Honeycomb&quot; reached number 30 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1957, and &quot;Kisses Sweeter than Wine&quot; climbed to number 7 the following month. Both &quot;Kisses Sweeter than Wine&quot; and &quot;Oh-Oh, I&#x27;m Falling in Love Again&quot; were million sellers.

The success of &quot;Honeycomb&quot; earned Rodgers guest appearances on numerous variety programs during 1957, including the &quot;Shower of Stars&quot; program, hosted by Jack Benny, on October 31, 1957, and the Big Record with Patti Page, on December 4, 1957. Rodgers also made several appearances on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, including on September 8, 1957, when he was seen by 48,500,000, the largest television audience of his entire career, and November 3, 1957. In 1958, he appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;. Also in 1958, he sang the opening theme song of the film &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot;, starring Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward and Orson Welles. He then had his own short-lived televised variety show on NBC in 1959.

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Wreck of the John B&quot; was a number 1 hit in Canada, and reached No. 64 on the U.S.charts. His biggest hit of the decade in the UK was &quot;English Country Garden&quot;, a version of the folk song &quot;Country Gardens&quot;, which reached number 5 in the chart in June 1962. In 1962, he moved to the Dot label, and four years later to A&amp;M Records. He also appeared in some films, including &quot;The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come&quot; and &quot;Back Door to Hell&quot;, which he helped finance.

In 1966, a long dry spell ended for Rodgers when he re-entered the Top 40 with &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot; (later to be recorded by Eddy Arnold, Elvis Presley, Glen Campbell, Mason Williams, Scott Walker, and Sonny James). In 1967, he changed record labels, signing with A&amp;M Records. It was with that label that Rodgers had his final charting Top 100 single, &quot;Child of Clay&quot;, written by Ernie Maresca (of &quot;Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)&quot; fame). He performed the song on several television variety shows, including &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, but it never became a big hit; it reached number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

===Later career===
Recovery from injuries sustained mysteriously on a highway in 1967 caused an approximately year-long period in which Rodgers ceased to perform. Meanwhile, his voice was still being heard: Several of his earlier hits were used in jingles in the 1970s, one for SpaghettiOs and another for Honeycomb breakfast cereal. And Rodgers&#x27; songs continued to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country and Easy Listening charts until 1979. During the summer of 1969, he made a brief return to network television with a summer variety show on ABC (which later bought the rights to Rodgers&#x27; Dot Records releases, now owned by Universal Music Group). It was not until the early 1980s when he began doing some limited live appearances again. Among the earliest was a series of shows in late February 1983: he performed at Harrah&#x27;s Reno Casino Cabaret. He also performed a few shows in other cities, including at a nightclub named Mister Days in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in late 1983.

Rodgers appeared in the 1999 video &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Graffiti&quot; by American Public Television, along with about 20 other performers. Nevertheless, he gave &quot;Honeycomb&quot; a try, and he mentioned that he had a show in Branson, Missouri.

Rodgers returned to his hometown of Camas, Washington in 2011 and 2012, performing to sell-out crowds. In 2013, his neighbors successfully got a street named after him, in the neighborhood where he grew up.

==Head injuries==
On December 1, 1967, Rodgers suffered traumatic head injuries after the car he was driving was stopped by an off-duty police officer near the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles. He had a fractured skull and required several surgeries. Initial reports in the newspapers attributed his injuries to a severe beating with a blunt instrument by unknown assailants. Rodgers had no specific memory of how he had been injured, remembering only that he had seen blindingly bright lights from a car pulling up behind him.

A few days later, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) stated that off-duty LAPD officer Michael Duffy (at times identified in the press as Richard Duffy) had stopped him for erratic driving, and that Rodgers had stumbled, fallen and hit his head. According to the police version, Duffy then called for assistance from two other officers, and the three of them put the unconscious Rodgers into his car and left the scene. That account was supported by the treating physicians, who had first blamed the skull fracture on a beating but, by the latter part of December, they concluded that Rodgers had in fact fallen and that had caused his injuries.

== Lawsuits ==
The following month, Rodgers filed an $11 million lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles, claiming that the three officers had beaten him. The police and the L.A. County District Attorney rejected these claims, although the three officers (identified in the press as Michael T. Duffy, 27; Raymond V. Whisman, 29, and Ronald D. Wagner, 32) were given two-week suspensions for improper procedures in handling the case, particularly their leaving the injured Rodgers alone in his car. (He was later found by a worried friend.) Duffy had had a previous four-day suspension for using unnecessary force; he had used a blackjack on a juvenile.

The three officers and the LA Fire and Police Protective League filed a $13 million slander suit against Rodgers for his public statements accusing them of brutality.

Neither suit came to trial; the police slander suit was dropped, and in 1973 Rodgers elected to accept a $200,000 settlement from the Los Angeles City Council, which voted to give him the money rather than to incur the costs and risks of further court action. Rodgers and his supporters still believe that one or more of the police officers beat him, although other observers find the evidence inconclusive. In his 2010 biography &quot;Me, the Mob, and the Music&quot;, singer Tommy James wrote that Morris Levy, the Mafia-connected head of Roulette Records, had arranged the attack in response to Rodgers&#x27; repeated demands for unpaid royalties he was due by the label. All of Rodgers&#x27; most successful singles had been released by Roulette, who were notorious for not paying their artists for their record sales.

In 1993, Raymond Virgil Whisman, one of the three officers who were alleged to have assaulted Rodgers, was arrested for assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her. The arrest occurred after sheriff&#x27;s deputies stormed his house after being informed that he was holding his wife at gunpoint. Deputies found 11 rifles, four shotguns, and two handguns in the home. Whisman was charged with two counts of assault and two counts of making terroristic threats.

== Publication ==
In 2010, Rodgers wrote and published his autobiography, &quot;Dancing on the Moon: The Jimmie Rodgers Story.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Rodgers and his first wife Colleen (&quot;née&quot; McClatchey) divorced in 1970, and she died May 20, 1977. They had two children, Michael and Michele. He had remarried in 1970, and Jimmie and Trudy Rodgers had two sons, Casey and Logan. He and Trudy divorced in the late 1970s, and he remarried again. Jimmie and Mary Rodgers were still married when he died, and they have a daughter, Katrine, who was born in 1989.

Rodgers suffered from spasmodic dysphonia for a number of years and could hardly sing. After a 2012 concert, he returned home for open heart surgery, following a heart attack he had suffered three weeks earlier.

Rodgers died from kidney disease on January 18, 2021, at the age of 87.

<doc id="835186" wikidata="Q3820431" url="?curid=835186" title="Domination (chess)">
<text>In chess, and particularly in endgame studies, domination occurs when a player controls all movement squares of an enemy piece.
==Examples==

This position occurred in the game Beliavsky–Korchnoi, György Marx Memorial, 2004. White blundered with 38.Kh2? allowing 38...Qd3 – this dominates the knight: despite having six squares available to it, its capture cannot be avoided. b2, d2, a5 and e5 are guarded by the black bishop, d6 by the black queen, and b6 by the pawn. Additionally, there is no way for the white queen to safely defend it, as every square she could defend it from is guarded by the black queen.


The example here is a study by Henri Rinck first published in &quot;La Stratégie&quot; in 1920. It is White to play and win. Normally, Black would be able to sacrifice his rook for the white bishop, leaving a drawn position (sacrificing it for a knight would be no good, since it is possible to force mate with bishop and knight), but in this case it turns out that the rook is dominated, and its capture cannot be avoided despite its freedom of movement. The first move of the solution is 1.Nd2, after which all rook moves allow it to be captured or immediately lost to a knight fork (1...Re7 2.Nd5+; 1...Re3 2.Nd5+; 1...Rd4 2.Ne6+; 1...Rb4 2.Nd5+) apart from one: 1...Re5. After 2.Nc4 the situation is similar: only 2...Re4 and 2...Rf5 avoid immediate loss of the rook. Whichever Black plays, White continues with 3.Nd6 when only 3...Re5 avoids immediate loss. 4.Bf3 leaves Black completely helpless: once again, all moves allow capture of the rook or a knight fork except 4...Ra5, when after 5.Ne6+ Ke5 6.Nc4+ the rook is finally won. At all stages the rook had wide freedom of movement, and twice it had the maximum number of fourteen squares available to it, yet it could not be saved; it was &quot;dominated&quot;.

<text>A fireboat or fire-float is a specialized watercraft with pumps and nozzles designed for fighting shoreline and shipboard fires. The first fireboats, dating to the late 18th century, were tugboats, retrofitted with firefighting equipment.
Older designs derived from tugboats and modern fireboats more closely resembling seafaring ships can both be found in service today. Some departments would give their multi-purpose craft the title of &quot;fireboat&quot; also.

They are frequently used for fighting fires on docks and shore side warehouses as they can directly attack fires in the supporting underpinnings of these structures. They also have an effectively unlimited supply of water available, pumping directly from below the hull. Fireboats can be used to assist shore-based firefighters when other water is in low supply or is unavailable, for example, due to earthquake breakage of water mains, as happened in San Francisco due to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

Some modern fireboats are capable of pumping tens of thousands of gallons of water per minute. An example is Fire Boat #2 of the Los Angeles Fire Department, the &quot;Warner Lawrence&quot;, with the capability to pump up to and up to in the air.

Fireboats are most usually seen by the public when welcoming a fleet or historical ships with a display of their water moving capabilities, throwing large arcs of water in every direction.

Occasionally fireboats are used to carry firefighters, Emergency Medical Technicians, and a physician with their equipment to islands and other boats. Some may be used as icebreakers, like the Chicago Fire Department&#x27;s &quot;Victor L. Schlaeger&quot; which can break 8 to 12 inch ice.
They may also carry divers or surface water rescue workers. Passengers from ships in danger can be also transferred to various kind of rescue boats. Rescue boats may be used also for oil and chemical destruction on rivers, lakes and seas. For example, the Helsinki Rescue Department in Helsinki, Finland has different types of boats for various kind of firefighting, rescue, and oil destruction tasks.

Also hydrocopters, rigid-hulled inflatable boats, fanboats and even hovercraft and helicopters are used in fire, rescue and medical emergency situations.

Cities with fireboats are usually located on a large body of water with port facilities. Smaller fire departments lacking resources will use a rigid-hulled inflatable boat or borrow boats from local rescue agencies (EMS, Coast Guard, military).

==History==
The first recorded fire-float was built in 1765 for the Sun Fire Insurance Company in London. This was a manual pump in a small boat, rowed by its crew to the scene of the fire. A similar craft was built in Bristol by James Hillhouse for the Imperial Fire Insurance Office in the 1780s. All fire fighting in Bristol was carried out either by private insurance companies or the Docks Company until the formation of the Bristol Fire Brigade as a branch of the police in 1876. In New York City, a small boat with a hand-pump was used to fight marine fires as early as 1809. By the middle of the nineteenth century, self-propelled steam-fire-floats were beginning to be introduced. The FDNY leased the salvage tug John Fuller as the city&#x27;s first powered fireboat in 1866. Prior to the &quot;John Fuller&quot;, as early as the late 1700s, the FDNY used hand-pumpers mounted to barges and large rowboats. The first purpose built steam driven boats were introduced by Boston Fire Department (&quot;William F. Flanders&quot;) and FDNY (&quot;William F. Havenmeyer&quot;) in 1873 and 1875 respectively. The first European fireboat to appear in Bristol was the &quot;Fire Queen&quot;, built by Shand Mason &amp; Co., London, in 1884 for service in the city docks. The 53 ft. (16.61 m.) long craft was equipped with a three-cylinder steam pump supplying two large hose reels; one of these was replaced with a monitor, or water cannon, in 1900. &quot;Fire Queen&quot; served until 1922.

<doc id="835226" wikidata="Q861601" url="?curid=835226" title="Lookout Mountain">
<text>Lookout Mountain is a mountain ridge at the northwest corner of the U.S. state of Georgia, the northeast corner of Alabama, and along the southeastern Tennessee state line in Chattanooga. Lookout Mountain was the scene of the 18th-century &quot;Last Battle of the Cherokees&quot; in this area during the Nickajack Expedition. On November 24, 1863, during the American Civil War, the Battle of Lookout Mountain took place here.

==Name==
The name appears on maps as early as Mathew Carey&#x27;s 1795 &quot;Map of The Tennessee Government.&quot;

==Geography==

===Northern and eastern slopes and summit===
Lookout Mountain and Sand Mountain (to the southwest) make up a large portion of the southernmost end of the Cumberland Plateau. The area was lifted from an ancient sea, and worn down by erosion for millions of years. The summit, called &quot;High Point&quot;, is just east of Thompsonville in Walker County, Georgia, with an elevation of above sea level. The foothills of the mountain extend into Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park.

The caves of Ruby Falls are in Lookout Mountain, and the rock formations of the &quot;City of Rocks&quot; (or Rock City) attraction are situated on the ridge. The area is home to the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway, Covenant College, and a hang-gliding school. Lookout Mountain is one of Chattanooga&#x27;s most visited tourist attractions.

Civil War-related landmarks include &quot;Point Park&quot;, operated by the National Park Service, and the Cravens House. Nearby are Georgia&#x27;s Cloudland Canyon and Cloudland Canyon State Park.

===Southern and western slopes===
The southwestern section of Lookout Mountain is in northeastern Alabama. The Little River flows over the mountain in Little River Canyon National Preserve and the DeSoto Falls in DeSoto State Park. The Noccalula Falls Park, featuring a pioneer village showcasing several nineteenth-century homes, is at the southern terminus of Lookout Mountain, in Gadsden, Alabama. Local legend claims that the 90-foot falls&#x27; namesake, Noccalula, jumped to her death because she could not marry the man she loved.

White water sports and rock-climbing (offering views of the Coosa River Basin) are this area&#x27;s key attractions.

===Seven states===
From the &quot;Rock City&quot; point, a marker claims that seven U.S. states can be seen: Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. The claim is repeated on numerous barn roofs in the surrounding area. No scientific investigation has upheld this claim.

=== Sunset Rock ===
On the northwest side of Lookout Mountain, Sunset Rock is a popular trailhead and tourist stop. It is part of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga Military State Park, the largest and oldest Civil War national park. Once known as Point Lookout, Sunset Rock provides a view of the Tennessee River, Signal Mountain and Prentice Cooper State Forest. The 100-foot cliff and moderate temperatures invite heavy traffic for its many climbing routes, which were completed in 1960. Sunset Rock is mainly sandstone, making for easier routing and climbing. Route development continued through the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s, routers pushed the grades ever higher. Climbing here is especially popular in the autumn months due to cooler weather.

Sunset Rock is attractive to Civil War enthusiasts due to its history; it has a Tennessee Historical Commission Marker at the head of the trail, describing its Civil War battle history. Confederate Generals Braxton Bragg and James Longstreet used Sunset Rock as a lookout in 1863 where they were able to track the movement of the Union troops as they entered Lookout Valley. It is claimed that, unknown to Longstreet, the Union troops could see him on Sunset Rock from the valley, where they were able to decipher the Confederate code, giving them the ability to anticipate the next moves of the Confederates. This resulted in the Battle of Wauhatchie, in which the Confederate army attempted to remove the Union forces from the river and block their supply lines. The attempt was unsuccessful; with the consequence that the Union forces were able to lift the siege of Chattanooga.

==History==

===Native Americans and Lookout Mountain===
The Chickamauga people, a branch of Cherokee Native Americans, lived in the Chattanooga area. The Chickamauga called the mountain Chat-a-nu-ga; hence the name of the city. Research suggests the mountain was inhabited, although no physical evidence has been found. On top of the mountain, the pattern of boulders suggest lanes or walls were once there.

===Revolutionary War and aftermath===
During the Revolutionary War, a battle between forces of John Sevier&#x27;s Washington District Regiment and those of Chief Dragging Canoe of the Chickamauga Cherokee, may have taken place on Lookout Mountain on September 20, 1782. Archaeologist and ethno-historian, Raymond Evans, has asserted that such a battle could not have taken place. However, a battle between militia forces under Joseph Martin, at the time Superintendent for Indian Affairs for both Virginia and North Carolina, and those of Dragging Canoe did occur there in August 1788.

===Settlements===
It was reported that on August 28, 1823, Daniel S. Butrick and William Chamberlain arrived at Lookout Mountain to perform missionary work with Native Americans. After the Trail of Tears, land taken from the tribes was purchased by the highest bidder without a lottery of land parcels. This method of distributing land caused much of Lookout Mountain to be owned by a few wealthy Chattanooga families.

The aptly named Summertown, on top of the mountain, was barely accessible from a small rutted turnpike which had been built in 1852 by Colonel James A. Whiteside. Whiteside, a native of Danville, Kentucky, owned a summer home which he converted into a hotel with several cottages. Naturalists who came to the area and visited the summit, such as Bradford Torrey, thought the cottages spoiled the environment and made it look like a cheap resort. Whiteside had purchased much of the land on the mountain&#x27;s summit. Another wealthy Chattanoogan, Robert Cravens, had purchased most of the land on the side of the mountain. Cravens was also instrumental in developing the area, and moved into the house he built (the Cravens House) in 1855. Within a few years, about 25 families regularly summered on the mountain.

Lookout Mountain&#x27;s Sunset Rock was once the home to the photo shop of JB Linn. After the Union forces under Major General Joseph Hooker took over the mountain, Linn gained access to Sunset Rock (then called Point Lookout). He built a small shack there and named it &quot;Gallery Point Lookout&quot;. In December 1863, he and his brother began taking photographs of many war commanders and officers, as well as wealthy civilians in the area. They became very successful with these pictures. The Gallery Point Lookout House is no longer in existence, but many of Linn&#x27;s photographs still exist.

===Civil War===
On November 24, 1863, the Battle of Lookout Mountain was fought on the slopes of the mountain. The majority of hand-to-hand combat took place near Cravens&#x27; house (about halfway to the summit). Lookout Mountain&#x27;s shape and location can in some conditions cause a unique weather phenomenon in the area: after dawn, fog will sometimes descend from the cooler mountaintop and stop about halfway down. Such an event took place the day of the battle and is the reason for its romanticized name, the &quot;Battle Above the Clouds&quot;. The battle was won by Union forces, enabling them to lift the Confederate siege of Chattanooga.

===After the Civil War===

====Yellow fever epidemic====
When cases of Yellow fever began to increase in the United States, the Chattanooga population believed that the city was immune to any possibility of an epidemic because of its mountain climate. In 1878, two local residents died of the disease, throwing the city into a panic that led some 12,000 people to flee. Many of these went up the mountain, believing the climate would offer some protection against the disease. After the epidemic passed, many people complained about the inconvenient and complicated travel up the mountain, and the St. Elmo Turnpike (Ochs Highway) was created to help with access to the mountain. Early in the 1900s, Lookout Mountain was incorporated as a town.

====Twentieth-century tourist boom ====
The twentieth century saw some wealthy businessmen settle permanently on the mountain, but its attraction as a tourist destination also grew. Entrepreneurs — among them Garnet Carter, J.B. Pound, O.B. Andrews, and Leo Lambert — began developing, improving, and marketing attractions in the 1910s and 1920s.

Today, tourist attractions include:
* Battle of Lookout Mountain Museum: soldier figurines and topographical maps.
* Lookout Mountain Incline Railway: a National Historic site, the railroad has an incline of 72.7%.
* Rock City: trails laid of rock with various attractions, including Lover&#x27;s Leap, Balanced Rock, and Fat Man&#x27;s Squeeze.
* Ruby Falls: a cave with a 145-foot waterfall deep inside the mountain.

<text>Roger Maxwell &quot;Doc&quot; Cramer (July 22, 1905 – September 9, 1990) was an American center fielder and left-handed batter in Major League Baseball who played for four American League teams from 1929 to 1948.

==Career==
A mainstay at the top of his team&#x27;s lineup for many years, Cramer led the American League in at bats a record seven times and in singles five times. He hit over .300 eight times, primarily with the Philadelphia Athletics and Boston Red Sox, and retired among the league&#x27;s career leaders in hits (10th, 2705), games played (10th, 2239) and at bats (5th, 9140). One of the few major leaguers to play regularly in center field after turning 40, he also ended his career among the major leagues&#x27; all-time leaders in games in center field (3rd, 2031) and outfield putouts (4th, 5412), and ranked seventh in AL history in total games in the outfield (2142).

Born in Beach Haven, New Jersey, Cramer was nicknamed &quot;Flit&quot;, which was the name of a popular insecticide, by sportswriter Jimmy Isaminger for his great ability to judge fly balls; in other words, he was &quot;death to flies.&quot; Indeed, he led AL outfielders in putouts in 1936 and 1938.

After starting his career in semipro ball in New Jersey in 1928, he was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics and hit .404 to win the Blue Ridge League batting championship in 1929. He played with the Athletics&#x27; powerful championship teams of 1929–1931, breaking in gradually, though in the postseason for the A&#x27;s he appeared only twice, as a pinch-hitter, in the 1931 World Series. After he hit .336 in 92 games in 1932, his place on the team was secure. On June 20, 1932, he tied a major league record by going 6-for-6 in a nine-inning game (and on July 13, 1935, became the only AL player to do it twice). He scored 100 runs in a season for the first time in 1933, and hit for the cycle on June 10, 1934. In 1934, Cramer set a team record among left-handed hitters with 202 hits and topped it in 1935 with 214 – still the Athletics franchise record for a left-handed batter; he finished eighth in the 1935 MVP voting. But the fortunes of the A&#x27;s declined just as Cramer was becoming a solid everyday player as the star players on the financially struggling team were sent on to other teams. Al Simmons and Jimmy Dykes were sold to the Chicago White Sox on the same day in September 1932, and Lefty Grove and Mickey Cochrane were traded away after the 1933 season. Jimmie Foxx was traded to the Red Sox in December 1935, and Cramer joined him a month later.

Batting leadoff, Cramer was a spray singles hitter, sometimes stretching them into doubles—although he was a not much of a base-stealer. He hit over .300 every year from 1937 to 1940 with Boston, scoring 100 runs in 1938 and 1939, and tied for the league lead in hits (200) in 1940. He was traded to the Washington Senators on December 12 of that year, and was sent to the Detroit Tigers exactly one year later after hitting .273. He was on the All-Star team five times (1935, 1937–40).

Two years after hitting over .300 for the last time with the 1943 Tigers, Cramer played 140 games in center field at age 40 in 1945 (albeit during World War II, when many regular players were in military service), and finally enjoyed significant play in the Fall Classic that year, leading the Tigers in the 1945 World Series with a .379 batting average, scoring seven runs and knocking in four, to help them win the Series 4–3 over the Chicago Cubs. He scored two runs and had one RBI in both Games 5 and 7. In his final seasons he was often used as a pinch-hitter, and he led the league with nine pinch-hits in 1947 before ending his career with two pinch-hit appearances in 1948, going 0-for-2 in that role and 0-for-4 overall in four games.

He was not known as a power-hitter, and liked to tell people about the time he was walked so the opposing pitcher could pitch to Hank Greenberg. On September 30, 1945, in St. Louis, the Tigers had men on second and third in the 9th, down 3–2. Cramer was walked to load the bases and set up a force play, but Greenberg followed with a grand slam that won the pennant for the Tigers. Interviewed by Donald Honig in the 1970s, Cramer told of how he would tease Greenberg: &quot;So anywhere I go and Hank is there, I always say, &#x27;You know, once they walked me to get to Hank Greenberg&#x27; — and never tell &#x27;em what happened, and then Hank always jumps up and says, &#x27;Hey, tell &#x27;em what happened.&#x27; But I never do; I just leave it at that.&quot;

In his 20-season career, Cramer batted .296 with 2705 hits, 1357 runs, 37 home runs, 842 RBI, 396 doubles, 109 triples, 62 stolen bases and a .340 on-base percentage in 2239 games. Defensively, he compiled a career .979 fielding percentage. By team, he batted .308 for the Athletics, .302 for the Red Sox, .282 for the Tigers and .273 for the Senators. He rarely struck out, leading the AL four times in at strikeouts-per-at-bats and finishing in the top four five other seasons. His 2031 games in center field placed him behind only Tris Speaker (2690) and Ty Cobb (2194) in major league history. His 2705 hits are the most of any player retired before 1975 who has not been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Cramer compiled two 6-hit games and five 5-hit games in his MLB career.

As White Sox batting coach from 1951 to 1953, he tutored the young second baseman Nellie Fox, who often credited Cramer with making him a major league hitter.

Cramer had worked as a carpenter before entering the major leagues, and continued to work as a carpenter during the off-seasons of his playing career. After leaving baseball, he resumed working full time as a carpenter and home builder.

He died in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township, New Jersey, at 85 years of age, where a street, Doc Cramer Boulevard, is named in his honor. A youth baseball tournament, the Doc Cramer Invitational Baseball Tournament, used to be held in Manahawkin every July.

<text>Roy Thinnes (; born April 6, 1938) is an American former television and film actor best known for his portrayal of lonely hero David Vincent in the ABC 1967–68 television series &quot;The Invaders&quot;.

He starred in the 1969 British science fiction film &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; ( &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; outside Britain), and also played Manhattan District Attorney Alfred Wentworth in the pilot episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

==Career==
===Early roles===
His first primetime role was in &quot;A Fist of Five&quot;, a 1962 episode of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, as a brother of an ex-policeman (played by Lee Marvin). Later that year he appeared in a small role as a cowboy named &quot;Harry&quot; on James Arness&#x27;s TV Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (&quot;False Front&quot; - S8E15).

He appeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as the &quot;philandering Dr. Phil Brewer&quot;
 from 1963 to 1965, which was later described as &quot;Thinnes&#x27; big break.&quot;

In 1964, he guested twice in episodes &quot;Murder by Scandal&quot; and the &quot;Lost Lady Blues&quot; of the 13-episode CBS drama &quot;The Reporter&quot;.

Later he co-starred as Ben Quick in the short-lived 1965-66 television series &quot;The Long Hot Summer&quot;, which ran on ABC. During its run he received around 1,500 letters per week and appeared on the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot;. 
===&quot;The Invaders&quot;===
During 1967 and 1968, Thinnes starred in &quot;The Invaders&quot;, a TV series in which he portrayed an architect named David Vincent who accidentally witnessed the arrival of aliens from another planet. Vincent waged a seemingly hopeless one-man campaign against them. The series became a cult classic, leading to other &#x27;aliens vs earthlings&#x27; films and TV shows.

His then-future second wife, actress Lynn Loring, appeared in the show&#x27;s 14th episode, &quot;The Panic&quot;.

Decades after the unexpected cancellation of the original series, he returned in 1995 as a much older David Vincent, as part of a TV mini-series titled &quot;The Invaders&quot; (starring Scott Bakula), and a decade later provided audio commentary for the official DVD releases of &quot;The Invaders&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted in 2008 that, although &quot;The Invaders&quot; &quot;ran for just two seasons ... in 2004, TV Guide placed main character David Vincent at #6 on its 25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends list.&quot;

In 2019, U.S. basic-cable network MeTV began running weekly reruns of &quot;The Invaders&quot; as part of its popular &quot;Red-Eye Sci-Fi Saturday Night&quot; overnight late Saturday evening and early Sunday morning sci-fi TV series programming schedule.

===Post-&quot;Invaders&quot;===
In another short-lived series, Thinnes had the lead role on &quot;The Psychiatrist&quot; as Dr. James Whitman.

&quot;Manhunter&quot; (in which Thinnes tracks a bank robbery suspect) is a TV Film that was broadcast on British TV in 1972 (with &quot;The Man Hunter&quot; as its title) but was not shown on American TV until 1976. A similar title (&quot;The Manhunter&quot;), but with a different plot, was used for a 1974-filmed TV movie. Thinnes guest starred on &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, becoming a casualty of war while commanding a B-17 bomber on a dangerous mission. He played an intrepid writer and investigator of the supernatural David Norliss in 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Norliss Tapes&quot;, a pilot for an unproduced TV series, and portrayed a suspicious schoolmaster in the TV movie &quot;Satan&#x27;s School for Girls&quot;.

He appeared in the disaster films &quot;Airport 1975&quot; as the co-pilot, and &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; as a sadistic SS captain. Thinnes was cast in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Family Plot&quot; in the role of nefarious jeweler Arthur Adamson when Hitchcock&#x27;s first choice, William Devane, was unavailable. Thinnes had already shot several scenes for the film when Devane suddenly became available. Hitchcock fired Thinnes and re-shot all of his scenes. He confronted Hitchcock in a restaurant and asked the director why he was fired. Flabbergasted, Hitchcock simply looked at Thinnes until the actor left. Some shots of Thinnes as the character (from behind) remain in the film.

Thinnes appeared in the 1979 miniseries &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; as Captain Dana Holmes.

During the 1982–1983 season, Thinnes appeared as Nick Hogan in 35 episodes of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. He later played Roger Collins in the 1991 revival of TV&#x27;s &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. He appeared on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Alex Crown from 1984 to 1985, and as Sloan Carpenter from 1992 to 1995. He also played a lead role in &quot;The Final Chapter,&quot; the first episode of the 1977 series &quot;Quinn Martin&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (known in the United Kingdom as &quot;Twist in the Tale&quot;), and in &quot;The Crystal Scarab&quot;, a first-season episode of &quot;&quot; in 1996. Thinnes was once considered by Paramount for the part of Jean-Luc Picard in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

He appeared in the 1988 pilot episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Favorite Bagman&quot;, as district attorney Alfred Wentworth. By the time the show was picked up in 1990, however, Thinnes was contractually obligated to another TV series (NBC&#x27;s remake of Dark Shadows), and so his character was replaced with district attorney Adam Schiff, played by Steven Hill. Thinnes made two appearances in &quot;The X-Files&quot; as Jeremiah Smith, an alien rebel with healing and shape-shifting abilities.

Twice Thinnes appeared on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; playing two different characters. From 1984 to 1985, he played the role of &quot;Alex Crown&quot; and from 1992 to 1995, he played the role of &quot;Gen. Sloan Carpenter&quot;. During both of his stints on the show, his characters became a father-in-law to the same character, Cassie Callison.

In 2005, Thinnes co-starred as Dr. Theophile Peyron in the movie &quot;The Eyes of Van Gogh&quot; about Vincent van Gogh (played by Alexander Barnett, who also wrote and directed) and his voluntary stay in an insane asylum. The movie focuses on Van Gogh&#x27;s relationships with Dr. Peyron, as well as fellow expressionist Paul Gauguin, and his brother, Theo.

==Biography==
Thinnes was born in Chicago of German descent. After serving in the United States Army, he relocated to California and attended Los Angeles City College. He was married to actress Lynn Loring from 1967 to 1984. Loring gave birth to their son Christopher Dylan Thinnes on Feb. 12 1969, and in 1974 gave birth to their daughter Casey Thinnes.

Thinnes&#x27;s third wife, actress Catherine Smythe, is the mother of two of his five children.

In 2005, Thinnes married film editor Stephanie Batailler.

<text>Vladimir Nikolaevich Konstantinov (; born March 19, 1967) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player who played his entire National Hockey League (NHL) career, from 1991 to 1997 with the Detroit Red Wings. Previously, he had played for Soviet club CSKA Moscow. His career was ended in a limousine crash six days after the Red Wings&#x27; 1997 Stanley Cup victory.

==Playing career==
===Defection from the Soviet Union===
Konstantinov was drafted 221st overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by the Detroit Red Wings, after impressing a Wings scout at the 1987 World Junior Championships, where a brawl broke out in the Soviet Union–Canada game.

Although the end of the Cold War was approaching, the Soviet Union was still not allowing their young ice hockey players to leave the country to play in the NHL. The Red Wings worked for over two years to get Konstantinov to Detroit. Konstantinov had previously signed a 25-year contract committing himself to the army, and if he deserted, he would be considered a felon in Russia, which would make him ineligible for a work visa in the United States. He also had a wife and daughter, and would not consider leaving without them.

A Russian journalist named Valery Matveev worked with Wings executive vice-president Jim Lites to secure an army discharge for Konstantinov. With cash provided by the Red Wings, Matveev bribed six Russian doctors to diagnose and confirm that Konstantinov had inoperable cancer, and thus secured his medical discharge from the military in the summer of 1991. The Red Wings were planning to fly Konstantinov and his family out from Russia and get him to Detroit in time for the start of training camp in September, but the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt forced a change in plans. With the airports closed, Matveev took the family by train to Budapest. Lites met them there, in Red Wings&#x27; owner Mike Ilitch&#x27;s private jet, and went back to Detroit with Konstantinov aboard. His wife and daughter followed two days later on a commercial flight.

===Detroit Red Wings===
Konstantinov played more aggressively than most of his Russian contemporaries, specializing in getting opponents off their game. &quot;For my game,&quot; he explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t need to score the goal. I need someone to start thinking about me and forgetting about scoring goals.&quot; While he was known as &quot;Vladdie&quot; to his teammates, his aggressive style of play earned him the nicknames &quot;Vladinator&quot; and &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot; among the media and fans, as well as &quot;the Red Shark&quot;.

Konstantinov was part of the unit known as &quot;The Russian Five&quot;, which consisted of him and fellow defenseman Slava Fetisov, and forwards Igor Larionov, Sergei Fedorov and Slava Kozlov.

Konstantinov earned the NHL Plus/Minus Award in 1995–96, with a plus/minus difference of +60. The +60 was the highest rating a player achieved since Wayne Gretzky finished with a +70 in the 1986–87 season; it wouldn&#x27;t be matched or surpassed until Johnny Gaudreau registered a +64 in the 2021-22 season.

In 1996–97, Konstantinov helped his team to win the Stanley Cup against the Philadelphia Flyers. Flyers head coach Terry Murray expected his top line of centre Eric Lindros, left winger John LeClair and right winger Mikael Renberg—known as the &quot;Legion of Doom&quot; for its scoring and toughness—to face Konstantinov. However, Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman surprised the Flyers by instead opting for the finesse-oriented defense pairing of Nicklas Lidström and Larry Murphy to neutralize the Legion of Doom&#x27;s forechecking. In that same year, Konstantinov was runner-up to the New York Rangers&#x27; Brian Leetch for the James Norris Memorial Trophy, given to the NHL&#x27;s best defenseman. However, 1996–97 would prove to be Konstantinov&#x27;s final season.

==Limousine crash==
On June 13, 1997, following a golf outing with the Stanley Cup celebrating the Red Wings&#x27; championship triumph, Konstantinov, along with teammate Viacheslav Fetisov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, hired a limousine to drive them home. The driver, Richard Gnida, whose license was suspended at the time for drunk driving, lost control of the limousine and hit a tree in the median of Woodward Avenue in Birmingham, Michigan. As a result of the limousine crash, Konstantinov suffered from serious head injuries and paralysis, spending several weeks in a coma, while Fetisov escaped with relatively minor injuries and was able to play the following season. Mnatsakanov sustained significant head injuries as well, and also spent some time in a coma; he has had a considerably more difficult recovery.
After the Red Wings successfully defended the Stanley Cup in 1998, Konstantinov was brought onto the ice in a wheelchair, surrounded by his teammates, to celebrate the win. Throughout the playoffs the Red Wings&#x27; catchphrase was the single word, &quot;Believe&quot;, and throughout the 1997–98 season the Red Wings wore a patch, with the initials of Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov featured prominently, with the word &quot;Believe&quot; written in both English and Russian.

Although Konstantinov was never able to play hockey again, the Detroit Red Wings still recognized him as part of their team. The Red Wings sought and received special dispensation from the NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup after they won the 1998 title.

==Retirement==
Konstantinov&#x27;s jersey #16 has not been officially retired by the Red Wings. However, out of respect for him, no player has been given the number since his last game. In 1999, newly acquired Pat Verbeek, who had worn #16 for much of his career, switched to #15. A similar situation occurred in 2001 when the Red Wings signed Brett Hull, who had worn #16 for the bulk of his career with the St. Louis Blues and Dallas Stars; Hull switched to #17. Drafted prospect Xavier Ouellet, who had worn #16 as a member of the Grand Rapids Griffins, switched to #61 for the Red Wings.

The Red Wings kept his locker set up for him through the 1997–1998 season, although he would never be capable of playing hockey again. A rock engraved with &quot;Believe&quot; sat in his place.

Konstantinov&#x27;s condition has improved considerably since his accident. While he still has trouble speaking and walking, he has been seen several times a season watching Red Wings games from a private box in Detroit. In a profile with the NHL, Vladimir&#x27;s wife Irina noted that injuries to his brain were in part to the left frontal lobe; she said that Vladimir &quot;can&#x27;t process idealistic feelings about life, like love of country or happiness that his child is graduating. Everything for him is matter of fact.&quot;

Konstantinov returned to the ice at Joe Louis Arena, helped by a walker, for the pre-game number retirement ceremony for Steve Yzerman on January 2, 2007.

At the 2014 NHL Winter Classic, Konstantinov was helped onto the ice for a rare Russian Five reunion with his former teammates Sergei Fedorov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Vyacheslav Kozlov and Igor Larionov.

On March 6, 2014, he was in attendance at the retirement of former teammate Nicklas Lidström&#x27;s number.

On December 27, 2016, he was in attendance along with 29 other members of the 1997 Stanley Cup winning Red Wings team and former coach Scotty Bowman to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1997 Stanley Cup championship team.

Konstantinov was present for the final game at Joe Louis Arena, participating with multiple other Red Wings legends in the post-game ceremony.

==International play==
Konstantinov has participated in six international tournaments for the Soviet Union:
*1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships
*1986 World Ice Hockey Championships
*1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships
*1989 World Ice Hockey Championships
*1990 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships
*1991 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships

During the final game of the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships between Canada and the Soviet Union, a bench-clearing brawl known as the Punch-up in Piestany took place. The fight is famous for officials having turned off the arena lights in a desperate attempt at ending the 20 minute melee. During the fight Konstantinov leveled a head-butt that broke Greg Hawgood&#x27;s nose. As a result of the brawl, both teams were disqualified from the tournament.

==Personal life==
Konstantinov lives in West Bloomfield, Michigan. His wife, Irina, now lives in Florida with their daughter, Anastasia Konstantinova.

<text>Bodyguards is a British television crime drama/action series, broadcast on ITV, that focuses on the cases of a specialized bodyguard unit, the &quot;Close Protection Group&quot;, in service of the British government. The series starred Louise Lombard and Sean Pertwee as protagonists Ian Worrell and Liz Shaw. Pertwee&#x27;s father, Jon, notably also starred alongside a character called Liz Shaw, played by Caroline John, who was his first companion during his time playing the Third Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The series was the brainchild of Jeffrey Caine, known as the creator of &quot;The Chief&quot; and script editor of the James Bond movie &quot;GoldenEye&quot;.

A total of seven episodes were broadcast: a feature-length pilot which aired in 1996, which guest starred Josette Simon as a visiting dignitary, followed by a single series of six episodes in 1997. The series has never been released on VHS or DVD, but was uploaded in full to YouTube in March 2016 by a member of the original production crew. The series was also broadcast by GBC TV (Gibraltar) as part of its relaunch in early 1999. The series aired on Monday evenings at 9:30pm, and the series received a full repeat run later on in the year.

==Critical reception==
Thomas Sutcliffe of &quot;The Independent&quot; said of the series; &quot;When you start this job, you never think you&#x27;re going to get bored,&quot; said one of the lumpy-jacketed characters in &quot;Bodyguards&quot;. It was a remark that might have been designed to extract a moan of sympathy from television reviewers, coming, as it did, halfway through this dim and derivative thriller, one of those professionals-with-guns series that give a distinguished theatrical actor the opportunity to look steely and say &quot;shit&quot;. In this case, the man in question is John Shrapnel, taking the role of the sternly parental head of a police protection unit. His charges are played by Louise Lombard and Sean Pertwee, as well as disposable cannon-fodder who can be dispatched relatively early in the story to demonstrate that theirs is not just a nine-to-five job. In last night&#x27;s episode, they were assigned to protect a businessman, back in England to give evidence before a select committee about a dodgy arms deal. Cue tough jargon (&quot;Red One. Position set. Principal landed. 11.04&quot;) and a pretty standard plot involving conspiracy in high places.&quot;

<doc id="835394" wikidata="Q17125367" url="?curid=835394" title="Surplus store">
<text>A surplus store or disposals store is a business that sells items and goods that are used, purchased but unused, or past their use by date, and are no longer needed due to excess supply, decommissioning, or obsolescence. The surplus sold is often military, government, or industrial goods; in the case of the former two, the business is usually called a military surplus store, government surplus store, war surplus store, or army-navy store. 

==Military surplus==
Military surplus stores sell equipment that was intended for the military but is unable to be used, no longer in service, or originally purchased in excess by the military. These stores often sell camping equipment or military clothing. Large amounts of former military clothing and equipment were sold in these stores after World War I and World War II.

=== By country ===

==== Canada ====
Known as army surplus stores, these typically also carry sporting goods related to hunting, fishing, and camping.

==== China ====

Army surplus stores in China are common. They mostly specialize in clothing, footwear, tarpaulins, and blankets, but also often sell occupational safety equipment.

==== Germany ====
In Allied-occupied Germany, the Allies initially confiscated the stock and materials of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, including 500,000 tonnes of stock and over 150,000 tonnes of scrap. In 1948 a government agency, the &quot;Staatliche Erfassungsgesellschaft für öffentliches Gut&quot; (&quot;State Collecting Company for Public Good&quot;, StEG), was formed to manage the sale of these items. In reference to the name of this agency, the army surplus was called &quot;Stegware&quot;, and their stores were nicknamed &quot;Steg shops&quot;. Goods sold by these stores included new and used clothing, camping equipment, and tools; early on, vehicles and heavier equipment were also sold. In the early 1950s the U.S. military began to add their own surplus from the war. The joint surplus was sold across Germany until the 1980s.

==== United States ====

Known as military surplus stores or army navy stores, surplus stores in the U.S. typically carry military or military-spec equipment. After the World Wars and Vietnam War, large amounts of military surplus was left over from the large amounts of equipment made for drafted troops, making their stock and sale common. However, with the advent of the military being volunteer and the fighting force being smaller, most modern military stores have had to switch to selling &quot;military-spec&quot; items, which are civilian remakes of military items.

<doc id="835425" wikidata="Q1846324" url="?curid=835425" title="Omaha race riot of 1919">
<text>The Omaha Race Riot occurred in Omaha, Nebraska, September 28–29, 1919. The race riot resulted in the lynching of Will Brown, a black civilian; the death of two white rioters; the injuries of many Omaha Police Department officers and civilians, including the attempted hanging of Mayor Edward Parsons Smith; and a public rampage by thousands of white rioters who set fire to the Douglas County Courthouse in downtown Omaha. It followed more than 20 race riots that occurred in major industrial cities and certain rural areas of the United States during the Red Summer of 1919.

==Background==
Three weeks before the riot, federal investigators had noted that &quot;a clash was imminent owing to ill-feeling between white and black workers in the stockyards.&quot; The number of African-Americans in Omaha doubled during the decade 1910–1920, as they were recruited to work in the meatpacking industry. In 1910, Omaha had the third largest black population among the new western cities that had become destinations following Reconstruction and during the Great Migration that started in the 1910s. By 1920, the black population more than doubled to over 10,000, second only to Los Angeles with nearly 16,000. It was ahead of San Francisco, Oakland, Topeka, and Denver.

The major meatpacking plants hired black people as strikebreakers in 1917. South Omaha&#x27;s working-class whites showed great hostility toward black strikebreakers. By this time, the ethnic Irish—the largest and earliest group of immigrants—had established their power base in the city. Several years earlier, following the death of an Irish policeman, ethnic Irish had led a mob in an attack on Greektown, driving the Greek community from Omaha.

The city&#x27;s criminal establishment, led by Tom Dennison and teamed with the Omaha Business Men&#x27;s Association, created a formidable challenge for the moralistic administration of first-term reform mayor Edward Parsons Smith. With little support from the Omaha City Council or the city&#x27;s labor unions, Smith wearily worked through his reform agenda. Following several strikes throughout the previous year, two detectives with Omaha Police Department&#x27;s &quot;morals squad&quot; shot and killed an African American bellhop on September 11.

Sensationalized local media reports of the alleged rape of 19-year-old Agnes Loebeck on September 25, 1919 triggered the violence associated with Will Brown&#x27;s lynching. The following day, police arrested 41-year-old Will Brown as a suspect. Loebeck identified Brown as her rapist; however, during questioning, Brown stated that Loebeck did not make a positive identification, which Loebeck later refuted. There was an unsuccessful attempt to lynch Brown on the day of his arrest.

The &quot;Omaha Bee&quot;, which published a series of sensational articles about many incidents of black crimes, publicized the incident as one of a series of attacks on white women by black men. A political machine opposed to the newly elected reform administration of Mayor Smith controlled the &quot;Omaha Bee&quot;. It highlighted alleged incidents of &quot;black criminality&quot; to embarrass the new administration.

==Beginning==

At about 2 p.m. on Sunday, September 28, 1919, a large group of white youths gathered near the Bancroft School in South Omaha and began a march to the Douglas County Courthouse, where Brown was being held. The march was intercepted by John T. Dunn, chief of the Omaha Detective Bureau, and his subordinates. Dunn attempted to disperse the crowd, but they ignored his warning and marched on. Thirty police officers were guarding the courthouse when the marchers arrived. By 4 p.m., the crowd had grown much larger. Members of the crowd bantered with the officers until the police were convinced that the crowd posed no serious threat. A report to that effect was made to the central police station, and the captain in charge sent fifty reserve officers home for the day.

==Riot==

By 5 p.m., a mob of between 5,000 and 15,000 people had crowded into the street on the south side of the Douglas County Courthouse. They began to assault the police officers, pushing one through a pane of glass in a door and attacking two others who had wielded clubs at the mob. At 5:15 p.m., officers deployed fire hoses to dispel the crowd, but they responded with a shower of bricks and sticks. Nearly every window on the south side of the courthouse was broken. The crowd stormed the lower doors of the courthouse, and the police inside discharged their weapons down an elevator shaft in an attempt to frighten them, but this further incited the mob. They again rushed the police who were standing guard outside the building, broke through their lines, and entered the courthouse through a broken basement door.

It was at this moment that Marshal Eberstein, chief of police, arrived. He asked leaders of the mob to give him a chance to talk to the crowd. He mounted to one of the window sills. Beside him was a recognized chief of the mob. At the request of its leader, the crowd stilled its clamor for a few minutes. Chief Eberstein tried to tell the mob that its mission would best be served by letting justice take its course. The crowd refused to listen. Its members howled so that the chief&#x27;s voice did not carry more than a few feet. Eberstein ceased his attempt to talk and entered the besieged building.

By 6 p.m., throngs swarmed about the courthouse on all sides. The crowd wrestled revolvers, badges, and caps from policemen. They chased and beat every African American who ventured into the vicinity. White civilians who attempted to rescue black civilians were subjected to physical abuse. The police had lost control of the crowd.

By 7 p.m., most of the policemen had withdrawn to the interior of the courthouse. There, they joined forces with Michael Clark, sheriff of Douglas County, who had summoned his deputies to the building with the hope of preventing the capture of Brown. The policemen and sheriffs formed their line of last resistance on the fourth floor of the courthouse.

The police were not successful in their efforts. Before 8 p.m., they discovered that the crowd had set the courthouse building on fire. Its leaders had tapped a nearby gasoline filling station and saturated the lower floors with the flammable liquid.

==Escalation==

Shots were fired as the mob pillaged hardware stores in the business district and entered pawnshops, seeking firearms. Police records showed that more than 1,000 revolvers and shotguns were stolen that night. The mob shot at any policeman; seven officers received gunshot wounds, although none of the wounds were serious.

Louis Young, 16 years old, was fatally shot in the stomach while leading a gang up to the fourth floor of the building. Witnesses said the youth was the most intrepid of the mob&#x27;s leaders. Pandemonium reigned outside the building. At Seventeenth and Douglas Streets, one block from the courthouse, James Hiykel, a 34-year-old businessman, was shot and killed.

The mob continued to strike the courthouse with bullets and rocks, and many civilians were caught in the midst of the mayhem. Spectators were shot while women were thrown to the ground and trampled. Black people were dragged from streetcars and beaten. Many members of the mob even inflicted minor wounds upon themselves.

==First hanging==
About 11 o&#x27;clock, when the frenzy was at its height, Mayor Edward Smith came out of the east door of the courthouse into Seventeenth Street. He had been in the burning building for hours. As he emerged from the doorway, a shot rang out.

&quot;He shot me. Mayor Smith shot me,&quot; a young man in the uniform of a United States soldier yelled. The crowd surged toward the mayor. He fought them. One man hit the mayor on the head with a baseball bat. Another slipped the noose of a rope around his neck. The crowd started to drag him away.

&quot;If you must hang somebody, then let it be me,&quot; the mayor said.

The mob dragged the mayor into Harney Street. A woman reached out and tore the noose from his neck. Men in the mob replaced it. Civilians wrestled the mayor from his captors and placed him in a police automobile. The throng overturned the car and grabbed him again. Once more, the rope encircled the mayor&#x27;s neck. He was carried to Sixteenth and Harney Streets. There he was hanged from the metal arm of a traffic signal tower.

Smith was suspended in the air when State Agent Ben Danbaum drove a high-powered automobile into the throng right to the base of the signal tower. In the car with Danbaum were City Detectives Al Anderson, Charles Van Deusen and Lloyd Toland. They grasped the mayor and Russell Norgard untied the noose. The detectives brought the mayor to Ford Hospital. There he lingered between life and death for several days, finally recovering. &quot;They shall not get him. Mob rule will not prevail in Omaha,&quot; the mayor kept muttering during his delirium.

==Siege of the courthouse==
Meanwhile, the plight of the police in the courthouse had become desperate. The fire had spread to the third floor, and officers faced the prospect of burning to death. Appeals for help to the crowd below brought only bullets and curses. The mob frustrated all attempts to raise ladders to the imprisoned police. &quot;Bring Brown with you and you can come down,&quot; somebody in the crowd shouted.

On the second floor of the building, three policemen and a newspaper reporter were imprisoned in a safety vault, whose thick metal door the mob had shut. The four men hacked their way out through the courthouse wall. The mob shot at them as they squirmed out of the stifling vault.

The gases of formaldehyde added to the terrors of the men imprisoned within the flaming building. Several jars of the chemical had burst on the stairway, and its deadly fumes mounted to the upper floors. Two policemen were overcome.

Sheriff Clark led the 121 prisoners to the roof. Will Brown, for whom the mob was howling, became hysterical. Fellow prisoners allegedly tried to throw him off the roof, but Deputy Sheriffs Hoye and McDonald foiled the attempt.

Sheriff Clark ordered that female prisoners be taken from the building due to their distress. They ran down the burning staircases clad only in prison pajamas. Some of them fainted on the way. Members of the mob escorted them through the smoke and flames. Black women as well as white women were helped to safety.

The mob poured more gasoline into the building. They cut every line of hose that firemen laid from nearby hydrants. The flames were spreading rapidly upward, and death seemed certain for the prisoners and their protectors.

==Lynching==
Three slips of paper were thrown from the fourth floor on the west side of the building. On one piece was scrawled: &quot;The judge says he will give up Negro Brown. He is in dungeon. There are 100 white prisoners on the roof. Save them.&quot;

Another note read: &quot;Come to the fourth floor of the building and we will hand the negro over to you.&quot;

The mob in the street cheered at the last message. Boys and young men placed firemen&#x27;s ladders against the building. They mounted to the second story. One man had a heavy coil of rope on his back, and another carried a shotgun.

Two or three minutes after the unidentified men had climbed to the fourth floor, a mighty shout and a fusillade of shots were heard from the south side of the building.

Will Brown had been captured. A few minutes later, his lifeless body was hanging from a telephone post at Eighteenth and Harney Streets. Hundreds of revolvers and shotguns were fired at the corpse as it dangled in mid-air. Then, the rope was cut. Brown&#x27;s body was tied to the rear end of an automobile. It was dragged through the streets to Seventeenth and Dodge Streets, four blocks away. The oil from red lanterns used as danger signals for street repairs was poured on the corpse. It was burned. Members of the mob hauled the charred remains through the business district for several hours.

Sheriff Clark said that black prisoners hurled Brown into the hands of the mob as its leaders approached the stairway leading to the county jail. Clark also reported that Brown moaned &quot;I am innocent, I never did it; my God, I am innocent,&quot; as he was surrendered to the mob. Newspapers have quoted alleged leaders of the mob as saying that Brown was shoved at them through a blinding smoke by persons whom they could not see.

==Aftermath==

The lawlessness continued for several hours after Brown had been lynched. Both the police patrol and emergency automobile were burned. Three times, the mob went to the city jail. The third time its leaders announced that they were going to burn it (but never did). Meanwhile, Omaha officials requested assistance from the United States Army, which had been going on long before Brown was killed.

The riot lasted until 3 a.m., on the morning of September 29. At that hour, federal troops, under command of Colonel John E. Morris of the 20th Infantry, arrived from Fort Omaha and Fort Crook. Troops manning machine guns were placed in the heart of Omaha&#x27;s business district; in North Omaha, the center of the black community, to protect civilians there; and in South Omaha, to prevent more mobs from forming. Major General Leonard Wood, commander of the Central Department, came the next day to Omaha by order of Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Peace was enforced by 1,600 soldiers.

Martial law was not formally proclaimed in Omaha, but it was effectively enacted throughout the city. By the request of City Commissioner W.G. Ure, who was acting mayor, Wood also took control over the police department.

On October 1, 1919, Brown was laid to rest in Omaha&#x27;s Potters Field. The interment log listed only one word next to his name: &quot;Lynched&quot;.

==Causes and consequences==
The Omaha Riot was denounced throughout the country. The arrest and prosecution of mob leaders was widely demanded. Police and military authorities apprehended 100 of the participants on charges ranging from murder to arson and held them for trial. The Army presence in Omaha was the largest in response to any of the race riots, with 70 officers and 1,222 enlisted men. By early October, the emergency had passed and the Army contingent declined to two regiments by the middle of the month.

Omaha police would identify another 300 people wanted for questioning, including Loebeck&#x27;s brother who had disappeared.

The district court ordered a grand jury to convene and investigate the riots, and a grand jury was impaneled on October 8. After a six-week session, the grand jury issued a report that criticized the Smith administration for ineffective leadership and police incompetence. Army witnesses testified to their belief that more prompt police action could have controlled the riot. One hundred and twenty indictments were handed down for involvement in the riots.

Of the 120 persons indicted for involvement in the riot, most were never successfully prosecuted, and all were eventually released after serving no term of imprisonment.

===IWW accusations===
General Wood initially blamed the disturbance on the Industrial Workers of the World, as part of the Red Scare then prevalent in the U.S. This interpretation was not supported by the evidence, however.

===Newspapers===
Reverend Charles E. Cobbey, the pastor of the First Christian Church, blamed the &quot;Omaha Bee&quot; for inflaming the situation. He was reported to have said, &quot;It is the belief of many that the entire responsibility for the outrage can be placed at the feet of a few men and one Omaha paper.&quot; The inflammatory &quot;yellow journalism&quot; of the Bee is credited by several historians for stoking emotions for the riot.

The U.S. Army was critical of the Omaha police for their failure to disperse the crowd before it grew too large. Other critics believe the Army was slow to respond to the crisis; this was a result of communications problems, including the crisis caused by President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s having been incapacitated by a stroke. (Requests by the governor for federal military assistance had to go to the President&#x27;s office.)

===Tom Dennison===
Many within Omaha saw the riot within the context of a conspiracy theory, the direct result of alleged conspiracy directed by Omaha political and criminal boss Tom Dennison. At the time, Rev. John Albert Williams, editor of a Black newspaper called &quot;The Monitor&quot; made the clearest and most direct public allegations against Dennison. A turncoat from Dennison&#x27;s machine said he had heard Boss Dennison boasting that some of the assailants were white Dennison operatives disguised in blackface. 

In more recent times, according to local historian Orville D. Menard in 1989, Dennison fomented the riot in the Gibson neighborhood near South Omaha. Dennison&#x27;s scheme was corroborated by police reports that one white attacker was still wearing the make-up when apprehended. As in many other Dennison-related cases, no one was ever found guilty for their participation in the riot. A later grand jury trial corroborated this claim, stating &quot;Several reported assaults on white women had actually been perpetrated by whites in blackface.&quot; They went on to report that the riot was planned and begun by &quot;the vice element of the city.&quot; The riot &quot;was not a casual affair; it was premeditated and planned by those secret and invisible forces that today are fighting you and the men who represent good government.&quot;

===Racial tension===
The event was part of an ongoing racial tension in Omaha in the early 20th century. There were attacks on Greek immigrants in 1909. The migration of many blacks into the city pursuing economic opportunities sparked racial tension in the state. After the Omaha riot, the Ku Klux Klan became established in 1921. Another racial riot took place in North Platte, Nebraska in 1929. There were also violent strikes in the Omaha meat packing industry in 1917 and 1921 and concerns about immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.

After the riot, the city of Omaha, previously a city in which ethnicities and races were mixed in many neighborhoods, became more segregated. Redlining and restrictive covenants began to be used in new neighborhoods, with African Americans restricted to owning property where they already lived in greatest number, in North Omaha. Although segregation has not been legally enforced for generations, a majority of Omaha&#x27;s black population still lives in North Omaha.

==Legacy==
In the fall of 1920, Dr. George E. Haynes, an educator employed as Director of Negro Economics at the U.S. Department of Labor, produced a report on that year&#x27;s racial violence designed to serve as the basis for an investigation by the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary. It cataloged 26 separate riots on the part of whites attacking blacks in widely scattered communities.

Together with other riots in 1919, the Omaha riot prompted the United States Senate Committee on Judiciary in October 1919 to call for an investigation of urban, industrial and racial problems. The committee members recognized lynchings as a justified cause of bitterness in the black community, and enumerated the riots of 1919 and lynchings as among the factors for its investigation. They called for leaders of the white and black communities to work toward reconciliation. In July 1918, President Woodrow Wilson had made a speech against lynching and mob violence. Congress had considered anti-lynching legislation since George Henry White introduced H.R. 6963 on January 20, 1900. President Joe Biden signed America&#x27;s first anti-lynching law in March 2022.

James Joyce, in a 1919 draft of his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, mentions the murder. He based his mention on an article in the London &quot;Times&quot; of September 30, 1919, which mistakenly put Omaha in Georgia.

In 1998, playwright Max Sparber had his play about the riot produced by the Blue Barn Theatre in the rotunda of the Douglas County Courthouse. The play, titled &quot;Minstrel Show; Or, The Lynching of William Brown&quot;, caused a minor controversy. State Senator Ernie Chambers condemned the play for using the device of fictional African-American blackface performers as the story&#x27;s narrators. He called for a black boycott of the play. Nonetheless, the play performed to sold-out houses and later enjoyed productions in other cities.

In 2007 the New Jersey Repertory Company presented Sparber&#x27;s &quot;Minstrel Show or the Lynching of William Brown&quot; in Long Branch. The cast included Kelcey Watson from Omaha and Spencer Scott Barros from New York City. Both actors had performed in previous productions of the play. It was directed by Rob Urbinati.

In 2009, California engineer Chris Hebert learned about the Omaha riot and the lynching of Will Brown after viewing a TV documentary on Henry Fonda, which mentioned the actor&#x27;s having been profoundly affected by the riot as a young Omaha native. Describing himself as having &quot;tears in my eyes&quot; after reading more on the riot and Brown&#x27;s death, Hebert further discovered that Brown still lay in the unmarked grave he was buried in at Potter&#x27;s Field. After consultation with staff at Omaha&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park, who located the grave after a lengthy search on June 11, Hebert donated money for the placement of a permanent memorial for Brown, giving his name, date and cause of death and the motto &#x27;Lest we forget.&#x27; In an open letter to the people of Omaha, Hebert described his feelings behind his effort:

<doc id="835439" wikidata="Q4906047" url="?curid=835439" title="Big Mouth Billy Bass">
<text>Big Mouth Billy Bass is an animatronic singing prop, representing a largemouth bass, invented by Gemmy Industries on December 16, 1998; sold beginning January 1, 1999; and popular in the early 2000s.

==Gemmy Industries==
Gemmy () is an American novelty manufacturing company, best known for its animatronic and inflatable characters. It is currently headquartered in Coppell, Texas. Founded in 1984, the company originally began producing ballpoint pens. Gemmy eventually ventured into novelty manufacturing, and in 2000, it achieved marketing success with the Big Mouth Billy Bass. Following that success, the company began predominantly making animatronic figures focused on the Christmas and Halloween seasons. The company distributes product internationally, especially to the United Kingdom and Japan.

==Design and features==
The fish is made of latex rubber with an internal plastic mechanical skeleton. At first glance, the product appears to be a mounted game fish. The item was conceived by a Gemmy Industries product development vice president following his visit to a Bass Pro Shop. The mounted fish turns its head, wiggles its tail on the trophy plaque, and sings cover songs, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Be Happy&quot; (1988) by Bobby McFerrin; and &quot;Take Me to the River&quot; (1974) by Al Green. Green claims he received more royalties from Big Mouth Billy Bass than from any other recordings of the song.

The singing mechanism was originally activated by a motion sensor and was designed to startle a passerby. Eventually, a button was added to activate it. There have been many variants of Big Mouth Billy Bass produced by Gemmy. These use different types of game fish and aquatic animals. Variants include Big Mouth Billy Bones (a skeleton fish that sings &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; by George Thorogood and the Destroyers), Travis the Singing Trout (a rainbow trout that sings &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; by Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich; and &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; by The Hues Corporation), Cool Catfish (a catfish that sings &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot;), Rocky the Singing Lobster (a lobster that sings &quot;Sea Cruise&quot; by Frankie Ford and &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;), Lucky the Lobster (a lobster that sings &quot;Doh Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; and &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;), and Frankie the Fish (a blue cod fish from a McDonald&#x27;s Filet-O-Fish commercial that sings an original song called &quot;Give Me Back That Filet-O-Fish&quot; plus a remix).

==Spin-offs and other versions==
The concept was later adapted into a large mounted deer head, known as Buck – the Animated Trophy (voiced by Clint Ford) as well as a medium-sized mounted bear head.

On December 7, 1999, a special holiday version of the Big Mouth Billy Bass was released. The fish had a Santa hat on his head and a ribbon with a sleigh bell on his tail. An anniversary edition followed in 2014.

A version from 2000 features a great white shark which plays John Williams&#x27;s theme from &quot;Jaws&quot; and a cover of Bobby Darin&#x27;s version of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;.

In 2001, a version named &quot;Big Mouth Billy Bass Superstar&quot; was released. This spin-off features Billy Bass standing upright on a base with a microphone in his hand. The first version sang &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; and &quot;Act Naturally&quot;, and a later revised version replaced &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; with &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. An exclusive version was sold only in France, with the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Be Happy&quot; and &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

In 2018, Gemmy Industries partnered with Amazon to create an Amazon Alexa-enabled version of the animatronic. This variant pairs with any Amazon Echo device through Bluetooth, and it will move its mouth when responding to Alexa commands. It also shakes its tail when playing music through Amazon Music but does not lip sync to songs. When not connected to an Alexa device, the fish sings an original song titled &quot;Fishin&#x27; Time&quot; when its red button is pushed.

In late 2021, TikTok user Kevin Heckart hacked a Big Mouth Billy Bass to not only lip-sync to any voice track or song, but to also dance via head and tail movements to whatever song is played through any smart speaker connections. Heckart later made a similar hack to the Cool Catfish and Frankie the Fish by the same company along with Loftus International&#x27;s Tommy Trout as well as an orange Chinese Big Mouth Billy Bass 15th Anniversary Edition knockoff in mid-2022, all of them synced to an Amazon Alexa playing Nathan Evans&#x27;s cover of The Wellerman.

A remake of the original Big Mouth Billy Bass was released in 2021. This new version cut &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Be Happy&quot; by Bobby McFerrin for Luke Bryan&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Huntin&#x27;, Fishin&#x27; and Lovin&#x27; Every Day&quot; in addition to Talking Heads&#x27; 1978 iteration of &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;.

In August 2024, a product called Trumpy Trout was marketed on Newsmax loosely resembling Big Mouth Billy Bass. This is an animatronic trout head that resembles Donald Trump including his yellow hair, and blue suit jacket and red tie. Instead of singing, when activated, Trumpy Trout repeated fish themed parody phrases of familiar Trump pastiches such as &quot;I&#x27;m building a new pond and the bass will pay for it.&quot;. Although, unlike Big Mouth Billy Bass, Trumpy Trout doesn&#x27;t look like a traditional taxidermy mounted fish, but simply the fish&#x27;s face omitting the back half of the fish. The fish head is framed by a parody of the Seal of the President of the United States that says &quot;Make Fish Great Again&quot;.

As part of Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Dookie Demastered&quot;, a 30th-anniversary edition of their third studio album &quot;Dookie&quot;&#x27; in which each song appeared on a separate novelty format, &quot;Basket Case&quot; was released on a Big Mouth Billy Bass rechristened the &quot;Big Mouth Billie Bass&quot;. Big Mouth Billie Bass was given out on a drawing, along with the rest of the album, October 11. The project was a collaboration with Los Angeles art studio BRAIN.

== In popular culture ==
It was reported that Elizabeth II had a Big Mouth Billy Bass displayed on the grand piano of Balmoral Castle. The Netflix drama &quot;The Crown&quot; incorrectly depicts Prince Andrew giving it to her as a birthday present in 1997.

The success of the Big Mouth Billy Bass has led to several pop culture appearances, including product placements. Some of the device&#x27;s notable appearances include &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Magicians&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;WALL-E&quot;, &quot;The Pirates! Band of Misfits&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Peppa Pig&quot;, &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot;, &quot;The Act of Killing&quot;, &quot;We Bare Bears&quot;, &quot;Solar Opposites&quot;, &quot;Big City Greens&quot;, &quot;King Tweety&quot;, &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Zig &amp; Sharko&quot;, and &quot;Barbie&quot;.

<text>A spar is a pole of wood, metal or lightweight materials such as carbon fibre used in the rigging of a sailing vessel to carry or support its sail. These include yards, booms, and masts, which serve both to deploy sail and resist compressive and bending forces, as well as the bowsprit and spinnaker pole.

In larger vessels during the age of sail, spare spars could be roped together to provide a temporary surface known as a &quot;spar deck&quot;. These served as jury-rigged repairs for permanent decks, or as an additional platform under which to shelter goods or crew. The term was also informally applied to areas of the forecastle or quarterdeck where spare spars were stored by laying them flat against the existing decking. In the modern era the term has been used to describe the uppermost deck on flush decked vessels.

<text>Olu Dara Jones (born Charles Jones III; January 12, 1941) is an American cornetist, guitarist, and singer. He is the father of rapper Nas.

==Early life==
Olu Dara was born Charles Jones III on January 12, 1941, in Natchez, Mississippi. His mother, Ella Mae Jones, was born in Canton, Mississippi. His father, Charlie R Jones, born in Natchez, was a traveling musician, and sang with The Melodiers, a vocal quartet with a guitarist.

As a child, Dara took piano and clarinet lessons. He studied at Tennessee State University, initially a pre-med major, switching to music theory and composition.

==Career==
From 1959 to 1964 he was a musician in the Navy, which he described as a priceless educational experience.

In 1964, he moved to New York City and changed his name to Olu Dara, which means &quot;The Lord is good&quot; in the Yoruba language. In the 1970s and &#x27;80s he played alongside David Murray, Henry Threadgill, Hamiet Bluiett, Don Pullen, Charles Brackeen, James Blood Ulmer, and Cassandra Wilson. He formed two bands, the Okra Orchestra and the Natchezsippi Dance Band.

His first album, &quot;In the World: From Natchez to New York&quot; (1998), revealed another aspect of his musical personality: the leader and singer of a band immersed in African-American tradition, playing an eclectic mix of blues, jazz, and storytelling, with tinges of funk, African popular music, and reggae. His second album &quot;Neighborhoods&quot;, with guest appearances by Dr. John and Cassandra Wilson, followed in a similar vein.

Dara played on the album &quot;Illmatic&quot; (1994) by his son, rapper Nas, and on the song &quot;Dance&quot; (2002), also by Nas, and he sang on Nas&#x27;s songs &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; and &quot;Street&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (2004).

<doc id="835500" wikidata="Q362505" url="?curid=835500" title="William D. Bloxham">
<text>William Dunnington Bloxham (July 9, 1835 – March 15, 1911) was the 13th and 17th Governor of Florida in two non-consecutive terms. Prior to his first term as governor, he served in the Florida House of Representatives. He was a Democrat.

His family had a plantation and he attended boarding schools in Virginia. He served in the Confederate army and opposed Reconstruction policies. As governor he sold off land for development.

In between his terms as governor, he served as state Comptroller when Francis P. Fleming was Governor. Bloxham was only the second governor of Florida to be born in the state.

==Early life and career==
Bloxham was born on a plantation in Leon County, Florida, the son of William and Martha (Williams) Bloxham. His great-grandfather had migrated from England to manage George Washington&#x27;s plantation and his grandfather endured adversity due to the War of 1812. His father was from Alexandria, Virginia, and moved to Leon County to run a plantation in 1825, becoming one of few white settlers in a Native American-dominated area. The elder William served in the Seminole Wars. Martha Bloxham was born in Twiggs County, Georgia, and moved to Florida as a child.

The younger Bloxham went to county school in Florida before being sent to preparatory school in Virginia at age 13. For the next seven years, he attended Virginian schools, including Rappahannock Academy where his teachers included eventual U.S. Senator William Mahone. Bloxham graduated from The College of William &amp; Mary in 1855 and acquired a law degree from the college. He was admitted to the Florida Bar but, when his health declined, he travelled to Europe and chose the more active life of a planter when he returned. In November 1856, he and Mary C. Davis travelled to her home city of Lynchburg, Virginia, to be married.

Bloxham became interested in politics and actively campaigned for James Buchanan in the 1856 presidential election. In 1861, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives without opposition. With the Civil War raging in 1862, Bloxham organized a company of infantry from Leon County which he commanded for the duration of the war. After the war, he staunchly opposed Reconstruction and, using his popularity as a speaker, was a leading voice among Florida Democrats. He served as a Presidential Elector for the Horatio Seymour/Francis Preston Blair Jr. Democratic ticket in the 1868 election.

==1870 election controversy==
In 1870, Bloxham was at the center of a political firestorm during one of Florida&#x27;s most violent periods. The Republican &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; were being resisted in Florida, often violently, by groups like the Ku Klux Klan. On Election Day of 1870, the most violent counties were inundated with federal troops at the request of Governor Harrison Reed. The chaos of that day included constitutional convention member, William Capers Bird, pointing a handgun at African American state senator Robert Meacham on the courthouse steps in Monticello, reportedly warning, &quot;no damned nigger shall vote here.&quot;

When the voting finally ended, it appeared that Bloxham had won the Lieutenant Governor race. Republicans used the chaos of the day as an excuse for rejecting the votes of nine largely Democratic counties, but Bloxham sought an injunction from the Florida Circuit Courts to prevent tainted results from being announced. A circuit judge granted the injunction but a federal grand jury indicted the judge. With the circuit judge in jail, the Republican-led board of canvassers rejected enough ballots to overturn Bloxham&#x27;s victory in favor of Republican Samuel T. Day.

Bloxham pushed the election dispute to the Florida Supreme Court, filing for a writ of mandamus on January 10, 1871, to force a recount. While the Florida Attorney General disagreed that a recount could be ordered, the Supreme Court Chief Justice sided with Bloxham. Republican legislators countered by repealing the law which created the board of canvassers in the first place and the Supreme Court was unable to compel the board to recount when the board effectively ceased to exist. Bloxham applied to the supreme court for a writ of quo warranto on February 20, 1871, to challenge Day&#x27;s victory, but the case did not begin until November 15. On June 1, 1872, the court finally ruled that Bloxham had won the 1870 election, by which time he had missed every state senate session in the term, meaning the term was effectively concluded. Although he took the oath of office on June 3, he could not perform the lieutenant governor&#x27;s only duty, which was to preside over the Senate. Thus, he is not named in lists of Florida&#x27;s lieutenant governors. The ruling was the first win for the Florida Democratic Party since the war.

==Governorship and the Disston Land Purchase==
In the summer of 1872, Bloxham was unanimously nominated at the Jacksonville Democratic Convention to run for Governor with Confederate General Robert Bullock as his running mate. In November, a severe Election Day storm reduced the vote count and Bloxham was defeated by Republican Ossian B. Hart by 1,200 votes. Hart, who had tried to claim Abijah Gilbert&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat two years earlier, died barely a year into his term. Bloxham served on the State Democratic Executive Committee and actively participated in the successful gubernatorial campaign of George Franklin Drew, promising protection to African Americans who voted for him. Bloxham was named Secretary of State.

In June 1880, Bloxham was nominated again to run for governor and so resigned as Secretary of State. In his second attempt, he won the election by over 5,000 votes and was inaugurated on January 4, 1881. Bloxham inherited a state debt of $1 million and a lawsuit that placed a lien on millions of acres of Florida land. Before his first month as governor was complete, Bloxham and Florida signed an agreement with Philadelphia saw manufacturing heir, Hamilton Disston, whereby Disston would attempt to drain the Everglades and would receive half of the land he reclaimed. With Disston actively planning his drainage efforts, Bloxham personally travelled to Philadelphia to make an even larger deal with him. On June 14, 1881, Disston signed a contract to purchase four million acres (16,000 km2) of Florida land, larger than the state of Connecticut, for $1 million, a purchase which made international news. When Disston and a second buyer, Sir Edward James Reed, paid in full, the state was out of debt and the first land boom soon followed.

Towards the end of Bloxham&#x27;s first stint as governor, in 1884, call for revision to the Florida Constitution increased, fueled by division among the state&#x27;s Democrats. Supporters of Bloxham&#x27;s predecessor, George Franklin Drew, criticized Bloxham for the Disston Land Purchase as well as his apparent commitment to Florida Panhandle development at the expense of the rest of the state. They rallied around Confederate General Edward A. Perry and a call for a Constitutional Convention. In 1884, Bloxham lost the Democratic nomination to Perry; in 1885, voters approved the convention which led to the 1885 Florida Constitution.

==Second term==
On April 18, 1885, Bloxham was appointed Minister Resident and Consul General to Bolivia by President Grover Cleveland. Bloxham took the oath of office but declined to report for the post. Instead, he accepted a November 1885 appointment to become the U.S. Surveyor General for Florida which he held until December 1889. When the state comptroller position became vacant on May 1, 1890, Governor Francis P. Fleming appointed Bloxham to fill it. Bloxham was unanimously nominated for the position in August 1890 and easily won the election, and was easily re-elected in 1892.

Comptroller Bloxham ran for governor and was victorious in 1896, 12 years after leaving the office. Despite his conservative reputation, Bloxham left his mark in his second term by reinstating and expanding the powers of a railroad commission, restricting monopolies and creating a statewide auditor to eliminate government fraud and waste. Fire insurance company regulation was initiated and women served as public notaries for the first time during Bloxham&#x27;s second stint as governor.

William Bloxham died on March 15, 1911, in Tallahassee, Florida. A planned Bloxham County, Florida, centered around Williston, Florida, was rejected by a referendum in 1915.

==Plantation==
Bloxham was a cotton planter in Leon County, Florida, and from the late 1850s owned the William D. Bloxham Plantation. He had 52 slaves.

<doc id="835505" wikidata="Q232825" url="?curid=835505" title="Zweigelt">
<text>The Zweigelt (), also known as Rotburger, is an Austrian hybrid grape variety created in 1922 by Friedrich Zweigelt (1888–1964), who later became Director of the Federal Institute and Experimental Station of Viticulture, Fruit Production and Horticulture (1938–1945). Zweigelt is a crossing between the St. Laurent and Blaufränkisch grape varieties.

==Wine regions==
Widely planted in Austria, Zweigelt vines have made inroads in the Canadian wine regions of Ontario&#x27;s Niagara Peninsula and of British Columbia, with limited plantings in Hungary, Australia and New Zealand. In the Czech Republic it is known as &quot;Zweigeltrebe&quot; and is the third-most widely planted red-grape variety, comprising approximately 4.7% of total vineyards. It grows in most of the wine regions in Slovakia. , newly established Belgian and Polish vineyards have also started to plant Zweigelt. , Washington state has several small plantings (only a few acres) of Zweigelt, including Wilridge Winery and Perennial Vintners.

==Naming and synonyms==
Zweigelt is also known as Rotburger (not to be confused with Rotberger), Zweigeltrebe, and Blauer Zweigelt.

The Austrian viticulturist, Dr. Laurenz (Lenz) Moser (1905-1978), recognized the suitability of the &quot;St. Laurent x Blaufränkisch&quot; variety for high-trained vines as early as the 1950s. Moser considered the designation &quot;St. Laurent x Blaufränkisch&quot; to be too long, and from this point onwards argued that the crossing should be named after its original grower, Friedrich Zweigelt. By 1958, the naming process had reached a stage at which it could no longer be stopped.

The official designation &quot;Zweigeltrebe Blau&quot; appeared for the first time in 1972, when the new Grape Variety Index for Qualitätsweine (Quality Wines) was launched. The name of the variety was altered to &quot;Blauer Zweigelt&quot; in 1978, and the synonym &quot;Rotburger&quot; was created at the same time. The aim here was to make it clear that the new cultivations of Blauburger, Goldburger and Rotburger/Blauer Zweigelt all shared a common origin. No evidence can be found to support the widespread assertion that Zweigelt himself had applied the designation &quot;Rotburger&quot; to his new variety.

&quot;Rotburger&quot; remains a valid synonym and continues to be used as a label designation by Austrian vintners, although most producers prefer the name Zweigelt. The problem of naming the variety after a committed Nazi was first addressed publicly in December 2018.

==Viticultural characteristics==
In the Puget Sound AVA it tends to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier than Pinot Noir, and has very large heavy clusters of dark blue-almost-black grapes. The wine tends to be darker in color than Pinot Noir grown in the same area, and produces a larger crop than Pinot Noir.

<doc id="835543" wikidata="Q2021969" url="?curid=835543" title="9th Division (Australia)">
<text>The 9th Division was a division of the Australian Army that served during World War II. It was the fourth division raised for the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). The distinctions of the division include it being:
* in front line combat longer, cumulatively, than any other Australian division;
* one of the Australian military&#x27;s most decorated formations;
* the only 2nd AIF division formed in the United Kingdom, from infantry brigades and support units formed in Australia;
* praised by both Allied and Axis generals, including Bernard Montgomery and Erwin Rommel, as well as non-Australian military historians, and;
* like the 6th and 7th Divisions, being one of only a few Allied army units to serve in both the Mediterranean and Pacific theatres.

During 1940, the component units of the 9th Division were sent to the UK to defend it against a possible German invasion. After serving during 1941–1942 in the North African campaign, at the Siege of Tobruk and both the First and Second Battles of El Alamein, the 9th Division returned to Australia. In 1943–1944, it served in the New Guinea campaign and, during 1945, in the Borneo campaign. It was disbanded, following the end of the war, in early 1946.

==History==

===Formation===

The 9th Division was the fourth AIF division raised, being formed in the United Kingdom in late 1940. Initially it consisted of only two infantry brigades which had been formed in Australia and dispatched to Britain in order to defend against a possible invasion following the Fall of France—the 18th and 25th Brigades—under the command of Major General Henry Wynter. Later, the 24th Brigade was also assigned to the division.

In January 1941 Wynter became ill and was replaced as divisional commander by Leslie Morshead. By February 1941, 9th Division headquarters had been relocated to the Middle East. Around this time the divisions of the AIF underwent a reorganisation as the decision was made to send the more established brigades to Greece; as a result both the 18th and 25th Brigades were transferred from the 9th to the 7th Division. They were replaced by the 20th and 26th Brigades, both of which were considered to be less experienced and therefore less ready for action.

===North Africa===

====Cyrenaica====
After completing its initial training in Australia, Great Britain and Palestine, the units of the 9th Division were sent to Cyrenaica in Libya in early March 1941 to complete their training and equipping as part of the garrison of this region. Short of equipment such as machine guns, mortars, anti-tank guns and carriers, most of the division&#x27;s artillery and cavalry units did not accompany the infantry brigades to Cyrenaica at this time. The 20th Brigade was the first unit from the division to move, departing on 27 February. It was joined shortly by the other two brigades. It was during this time that the division suffered its first casualties when German bombers attacked the transport column in which the 2/13th Battalion was travelling, killing two Australians and wounding one other. By 9 March the 20th Brigade relieved the 17th Brigade from the 6th Division, along the Cyrenaican frontier.
By late March, it became clear that German-led Axis forces planned to launch an offensive in Cyrenaica. As a result, the 9th Division commander, Leslie Morshead, ordered the 20th Brigade to withdraw from the frontier, moving back towards Benghazi. The offensive began on 24 March, quickly forcing the British units along the frontier back as it drove towards Benghazi. Two days later the 26th Brigade took up positions in the west near the coast to support the 20th Brigade which was holding the pass at Er Regima. At this stage, the division&#x27;s anti-tank troops were issued with captured Italian guns in order to make up the shortfall in British weapons.

As the Axis advance continued with German victories at Marsa Brega and Agedabia which threatened to outflank the units cut off in Benghazi, the 9th Division were ordered to fall back from their positions along the coast to the east to Derna. Lacking their own transport, they had to rely on that provided by other units and thus the withdrawal had to be undertaken in stages. In order to achieve this, the 2/13th Battalion was used as a rear guard and late in the afternoon of 4 April it undertook the division&#x27;s first action of the war when the Germans attacked their positions in the Er Regima Pass. Supported by British artillery, the battalion, spread out across an front, managed to delay a German force of about 3,000 personnel mounted in lorries and accompanied by armoured cars and tanks. Only lightly armed, however, they were unable to prevent the Germans from outflanking them, and gradually they were forced to pull back before. At 2200 hours, their transport arrived, and they were able to withdraw just as they were faced with encirclement. In this action, the 2/13th Battalion suffered five killed and 93 wounded or captured.

Two days after the action at Er Regima Pass, the 9th Division was ordered to fall back along the coast road towards Tobruk in what was later called the &quot;Benghazi Handicap&quot;. Due to the speed of the Axis advance and the division&#x27;s lack of transport, confusion reigned and part of the 2/15th Battalion, including most of its headquarters and its commanding officer, were captured.

====Siege of Tobruk====
Covered by rear guard actions at Er Regima and Mechili, the 9th Division reached Tobruk on 9 April 1941. The 7th Division&#x27;s 18th Brigade had arrived two days earlier and together with a number of British artillery and armoured regiments and an Indian cavalry regiment, the 18th King Edward&#x27;s Own Cavalry (now 18 Cavalry), they were placed under the command of Major General John Lavarack and ordered to hold the port for at least two months while a relieving force from Egypt was organised.

The first engagement came on 10 April when an Axis force approached the port from the west but was repelled. The following day, Tobruk was effectively placed under siege when German forces cut the supply road to its east, encircling the Allied garrison. On 13 April the first major attack came when the German commander, Erwin Rommel, launched an attack against the 20th Brigade west of the El Adem road. This attack was beaten off, although that night a force of Germans with mortars and machine guns managed to break into the defences only to be counterattacked by a small group of Australians, including John Edmondson, armed with bayonets and grenades. For his part in the attack Edmondson was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the first of seven which were bestowed upon members of the 9th Division during the war.

Over the course of the next six months the 9th Division and the rest of the garrison repelled repeated attempts by Rommel&#x27;s forces to capture the port. The Australian defence of Tobruk was anchored on three factors: the use of the pre-existing Italian fortifications around the port, aggressive patrolling and raiding of Axis positions and the firepower of the garrison&#x27;s artillery. Fighting from fixed positions, the Australian infantry successfully contained and defeated repeated German armoured and infantry attacks on the fortress. After the failure of the British attempts to relieve the fortress in May and June 1941 the 9th Division was successful in gradually improving Tobruk&#x27;s defences through aggressively raiding Axis positions.

Upon the request of the Australian War Cabinet, the bulk of the 9th Division was withdrawn from Tobruk in September and October 1941, and handed over to the British 70th Division with only the 2/13th Battalion remaining in the fortress at the time the garrison was finally relieved in December. The defence of Tobruk cost the 9th Division 3,164 casualties including 650 killed, 1,597 wounded and 917 captured.

====El Alamein====
;Syrian interlude
After its withdrawal from Tobruk the 9th Division enjoyed only a brief period of rest in Palestine before being redeployed to northern Syria where, as part of the British Ninth Army, it was responsible for guarding the Turkish–Syrian frontier. Here they were rejoined by the 9th Division Cavalry Regiment, which had been detached in June 1941 to take part in the Syria–Lebanon campaign. This deployment was the first time all the elements of the division had been concentrated in one area, albeit an area that stretched . In addition to its garrison duties, the 9th Division also conducted some much needed training in mobile warfare during its stay in Syria.

In early 1942 Australian I Corps, including the 6th and 7th Divisions, was withdrawn to Australia in response to Japan&#x27;s entry into the war. The Australian government, however, agreed to British requests to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East in exchange for an additional American division being sent to Australia.

;First Battle of El Alamein
During early 1942 the Axis forces advanced steadily through north west Egypt. It was decided that the British Eighth Army should make a stand just over west of Alexandria, at the railway siding of El Alamein, where the coastal plain narrowed between the Mediterranean Sea and the inhospitable Qattara Depression. On 26 June 1942 the 9th Division was ordered to begin moving from northern Syria to El Alamein. On 1 July, Rommel&#x27;s forces made a major attack, hoping to dislodge the Allies from the area, take Alexandria, and open the way to Cairo and the Suez Canal. However, the Eighth Army had regrouped sufficiently to repel the Axis forces and launch counterattacks. On 6 July, the lead elements of the 9th Division arrived at Tel el Shammama from the front, from where they would be committed to the fighting in the northern sector.

Before dawn on 10 July, as Rommel focused his efforts on the southern flank of the battlefield, the 9th Division attacked the north flank of the enemy positions and captured the strategic high ground around Tel el Eisa. In the days following, Rommel redirected his forces against them, in a series of intense counterattacks, but was unable to dislodge the Australians. On 22 July, the 24th and 26th Brigades attacked German positions on the ridges south of Tel el Esia, suffering heavy casualties taking positions on Tel el Eisa Ridge and Makh Khad Ridge.

The final phase of the First Battle of El Alamein was a disaster for the Allies and the 2/28th Battalion in particular: an attempt to capture Sanyet el Miteiriya, known as &quot;Ruin Ridge&quot;, on 27 July. The operation was part of a complex series of night attacks. The 2/28th suffered significant casualties and vehicle losses in its advance, but achieved its objective. However, the battalion was soon surrounded by German infantry. A planned advance by British tanks failed and German tanks arrived. The 2/28th&#x27;s positions came under a prolonged and methodical attack by the Axis forces. By the time they surrendered, 65 Australians had been killed. Although the vast majority of the 2/28th had become prisoners of war, 93 members of the battalion remained behind Allied lines and it was subsequently rebuilt.

;Second Battle of El Alamein
Following the fighting in July, the 9th Division remained in front-line positions around El Alamein, but were engaged in mainly static defensive duties for the next three months. Nevertheless, patrols were maintained and some raiding was undertaken, including a raid on 1 September undertaken by the 2/15th Battalion to seize a point south-west of Tel el Eisa in which 150 Germans were killed and another 140 taken prisoner, against which the Australians lost 39 killed, 109 wounded and another 25 missing.

By late October 1942, the Eighth Army, now commanded by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, decided to launch its own offensive in the Western Desert, amassing a force of some 220,000 personnel supported by 1,100 tanks and 900 artillery pieces. The 9th Division was positioned in the northern sector of the Eighth Army&#x27;s front at El Alamein, nearest the coast, as part of British XXX Corps. This sector was to effect the main thrust of the Allied attack. While XIII and most of XXX Corps failed to meet their objectives on 25 October, the 9th Division gained considerable momentum, attacking both frontally and executing a wide &quot;left hook&quot; from their original positions, in their sector, with one Axis outpost after another falling to them. Together with the 51st (Highland) Division, and the 2nd New Zealand Division, they had mauled the Italian Trento Division and the German 164th Division. By the following day the 9th Division had managed to further slice through the German 164th Division and trap the greater part of it against the sea. This caused the Axis to rush reinforcements to their sector.

As events unfolded, it was on the 9th that Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander, pinned his hopes on a breakthrough. Before this breakthrough was attempted, however, the 9th Division was subjected to numerous counter-attacks by German forces and many of the division&#x27;s units suffered so many casualties that they were described as &quot;mere skeletons&quot;. By the night of 31 October/1 November Morshead decided to relieve his forward brigade, the 26th Brigade, with the relatively fresh 24th Brigade, however, the following day two German divisions attacked the brigade.

On 2 November, Operation Supercharge—as the breakout was named—began and the final phase of the battle began. The British armoured formations suffered heavily in the initial stages, before on the second day the 51st Division managed to force a gap through the Axis lines, creating a gap of over through which the armour was redirected. The result of this was that the pressure was taken off the 9th Division as the focus of the fighting shifted to the south of Tel el Eisa. After this the 9th Division ceased offensive action, although they continued patrolling operations until 4 November when Rommel ordered a general withdrawal. The four months that the 9th Division had been involved in the fighting around El Alamein cost them 1,225 killed, 3,638 wounded and 946 captured, for a total of 5,809 casualties.

===South West Pacific===

In October 1942 the Australian government requested that the 9th Division be released from service in the Middle East and returned to Australia to be utilised against the Japanese in the Pacific. Although both the British prime minister, Winston Churchill and the American president Franklin Roosevelt advised against this, the Australian prime minister John Curtin insisted and by mid December the decision to bring the division back to Australia was confirmed. In late December the division concentrated around Gaza, where a divisional parade was held before preparations for embarkation began.

The 9th Division began embarking for its return to Australia on 24 January 1943. Transported on four troopships—the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, &quot;Ile de France&quot;, &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;Aquitania&quot;—as part of Operation Pamphlet the division arrived at Fremantle in Western Australia on 18 February whereupon all members of the division were granted three weeks leave. Welcome-home parades were held in every Australian capital city, after which the 9th Division began reforming in April 1943 in the semi-tropical Atherton Tablelands region of Far North Queensland where it began re-organising and re-training for jungle warfare. As part of the conversion to a Jungle Division many of the division&#x27;s units were either separated from the division, reorganised into new roles or disbanded. Of note, the division&#x27;s cavalry unit, the 9th Division Cavalry Regiment, gave up its vehicles and was converted to the commando role, becoming the 2/9th Cavalry Commando Regiment. After completing amphibious training near Cairns the 9th Division, now under Major General George Wootten who had taken command of the division in March, departed for Milne Bay in New Guinea in late July and early August 1943.

====New Guinea====

;Lae

The 9th Division&#x27;s first task in New Guinea was to liberate the town of Lae in a joint operation with the 7th Division. The 9th Division would carry out an amphibious landing to the east of the town at Malahang—the first large scale seaborne landing by an Australian formation since the Gallipoli campaign in 1915—while the 7th Division would be flown into the recently secured Nadzab airfield, to the west of Lae. The 20th Brigade, now under Brigadier Victor Windeyer, was chosen as the lead assault unit and on 1 September it began embarking at Milne Bay. Departing the following day, they were transported to the Buna–Morobe area where it linked up with the 57 landing craft that had been assigned to the operation. On the night of 3/4 September they began the run to the landing beaches, arriving just before dawn.

At 0630 hours on 4 September the 20th Brigade launched the initial assault under the cover of naval bombardment. Two battalions were landed on the main beach, codenamed Red Beach, while one more was landed west at Yellow Beach. Experiencing no opposition on the beaches, patrols were sent out to effect a link up along the beachhead. 35 minutes later as the 26th Brigade came ashore, they were attacked by nine Japanese aircraft which inflicted a number of casualties on the Australians in the LCIs, with eight personnel being killed, including the commanding officer of the 2/23rd Battalion, while another 20 were wounded. The following day, the 26th Brigade passed through the perimeter that had been set up by the 20th Brigade and began to advance along the coast towards Lae, crossing the Buso river before nightfall on 5 September. That night, the 24th Brigade, which had been held back as the divisional reserve, landed at the beachhead.

After establishing their supply bases the two Australian divisions raced each other to Lae. The 7th Division entered the town several hours ahead of the 9th Division on 16 September. The 9th Division&#x27;s advance had been held up by Japanese resistance and difficulties with crossing the rivers between the landing beaches and Lae.

;Huon Peninsula campaign

The capture of Lae ahead of schedule meant that the focus of Allied operations could then be shifted upon an advance up the Huon Peninsula, which was strategically important to the Allies as it would allow them to establish air and naval bases for future operations. On 22 September 1943, only six days after the fall of Lae, the 20th Brigade made an amphibious landing at Scarlet Beach, north of Finschhafen. Because of the haste with which the operation had been put together, there had been no time for rehearsals and this, coupled with faulty maps and the fact that the landing took place in darkness, resulted in the majority of the brigade being landed on the wrong beach. Allied intelligence estimates of Japanese strength around Finschhafen were also faulty, with an expected force of between 500 and 2,100, although the Japanese really had around 5,000 personnel in the area.

Nevertheless, after a week of heavy fighting against well-entrenched Japanese troops, the Australians captured the town and airfield of Finschhafen, declaring it liberated on 2 October.

However, most of the Japanese that had been around Finschhafen managed to retreat to a mountain around Sattelberg. On 16 October they launched a counterattack from there. In response to this, the 26th Brigade was brought up to relieve the 20th, and by 25 October the Japanese counterattack was beaten off. The 9th Division then went on the offensive against Sattelberg on 7 November. With intermittent and sometimes heavy air support, the Australian troops worked to uproot the Japanese from the strategically important peak. It fell to the 9th Division on 25 November 1943, after the 2/48th Battalion reached the summit. It was during this final assault that Sergeant Tom Derrick carried out the actions that led to him receiving the Victoria Cross.

====Borneo====
In January 1944 the 9th Division was relieved by the 5th Division around Sio and progressively over the following two months they were brought back to Australia. After a period of leave the division once again re-formed on the Atherton Tablelands. Due to high personnel turnover in this period as personnel were discharged or transferred to other units, many of the division&#x27;s units had to be virtually rebuilt from scratch. Indeed, in order to bring the division&#x27;s infantry units up to strength an entire Militia battalion, consisting of nearly 400 personnel from the 62nd Battalion, was broken up to provide reinforcements.

Due to rapid developments in the war and strategic uncertainty over the role of Australian forces in the Pacific, the 9th Division remained in Australia for over a year before seeing action once more. While the Australian I Corps (of which the 9th Division was part) had originally been intended to participate in the liberation of the Philippines, these plans were dropped, and the Corps was instead tasked with the liberation of Borneo. This would be the division&#x27;s final involvement in the war and its participation in the campaign was broken up into two primary operations: a landing on Tarakan and another on Brunei and Labuan.

;Tarakan

The 26th Brigade group was assigned the task of capturing Tarakan Island and destroying the Japanese garrison. Japanese forces on the island were estimated at 2,000 personnel along with around 250 civilians working in the oil plants. On 30 April 1945 a small force of commandos from the 2/4th Commando Squadron, along with a battery of 25-pounder field guns from the 2/7th Field Regiment, were landed on Sadau Island off the coast of Tarakan, from where they would provide indirect fire support during the landing. The following day, 1 May, at 0640 the battery on Sadau opened the preliminary bombardment along with two cruisers and six destroyers stationed offshore. At 0656 hours the main assault began as the LCIs carrying the two battalions that would lead the attack—the 2/23rd and 2/48th—crossed the line of departure and headed towards the landing beach at Lingkas.

Although initially Japanese opposition to the landing was light, as the Australians advanced inland from the landing beach, the resistance grew in its intensity and it was mid June by the time that the main Japanese force was broken up and mopping up operations began. These operations continued throughout July until starvation forced the majority of those remaining to surrender. The Australians lost 250 killed and 670 wounded in this operation, while the Japanese lost around 1,500 personnel killed and another 250 captured trying to defend the island.

;Brunei and Labuan

The remainder of the 9th Division landed in the Labuan and Brunei area on 10 June 1945. Tasked with securing Brunei Bay in order to establish a naval base and secure vital oil and rubber production facilities, 14,079 personnel from the division took part, just under half of a total of 30,000 that were assigned to the operation. Following a preliminary naval and aerial bombardment, the 24th Brigade landed at the southern end of Labuan island, which situated as it was at the entrance of Brunei Bay, commanded the approach to northern Borneo. At the same time, the 20th Brigade landed near Brooketon, on a small peninsula in the southern end of the bay. A third, albeit smaller, landing was made by one of the 20th Brigade&#x27;s battalions—the 2/15th—on the small island of Muara. The island had not been garrisoned by the Japanese and all the Australian landings went in unopposed.

The 20th Brigade rapidly secured Brunei town against relatively light opposition, suffering only 40 casualties in this campaign. The 24th Brigade, however, encountered greater opposition in taking the island of Labuan, where the defenders withdrew to an inland stronghold where they held out along dense jungle covered ridges and muddy swamps. In order to subdue the Japanese resistance an intense naval and artillery bombardment was laid down over the course of a week before an assault was put in by two companies of infantry supported by tanks and flamethrowers.

After securing Labuan, the 24th Brigade was landed on the northern shore of Brunei Bay on 16 June, while the 20th Brigade continued to consolidate the southern lodgement by advanced south-west along the coast towards Kuching and securing the hinterland as well. The 2/32nd Battalion landed at Padas Bay and seized the town of Weston, before sending out patrols towards Beaufort, inland. Held by 800–1,000 Japanese, on 27 June an attack was carried out there by the 2/43rd Battalion. Amid a torrential downpour and encountering difficult terrain, the 2/32nd Battalion secured the south bank of the Padas River, while one company from the 2/43rd was sent to take the town and another marched to the flanks, to take up ambush positions along the route that the Japanese were expected to withdraw along. The 2/28th Battalion secured the lines of communication north of the river. On the night of 27/28 June the Japanese launched six counterattacks which devolved into hand-to-hand combat. Amid appalling conditions, one company became isolated and the next morning another was sent to its aid to attack the Japanese from the rear. Fighting its way through numerous Japanese positions, the company killed at least 100 Japanese and one of its members, Private Tom Starcevich, was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his efforts.

Following this, the Japanese began to withdraw from Beaufort and the Australians began a slow, cautious advance using indirect fire to limit casualties. By 12 July they occupied Papar, and from there sent out patrols to the north and along the river until the cessation of hostilities. By August the fighting came to an end. The division&#x27;s total casualties in this operation were 114 killed and 221 wounded, while the Japanese lost at least 1,234 personnel.

===Disbandment===
Following the end of the war the 9th Division remained in Borneo and performed emergency relief and occupation duties until the arrival of Indian troops in January 1946. The 9th Division began gradually demobilising on 1 October 1945 with soldiers with dependants or long service being the first to be discharged. The division&#x27;s headquarters was disbanded on 10 February 1946 and the last unit of the division was disbanded in May 1946. While the majority of the division&#x27;s personnel returned civilian life after the war, some continued to serve with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, joining the 66th Infantry Battalion.

==Casualties==
The 9th Division suffered a total of 2,732 killed in action, 7,501 wounded and 1,863 captured. These 12,096 casualties represent approximately one quarter of the personnel who served with the division.

<doc id="835561" wikidata="Q560559" url="?curid=835561" title="Constans II (son of Constantine III)">
<text>Constans II (died 411) was the son of Western Roman emperor Constantine III, and served as his co-emperor from 409 to 411. Constans was a monk prior to his father being acclaimed emperor by the army in Britain in early 407, an act of rebellion against the ruling emperor Honorius. He was summoned to Gaul, appointed to the position of caesar (heir) and swiftly married so that a dynasty could be founded. In Hispania, Honorius&#x27;s relatives rose in 408 and expelled Constantine&#x27;s administration. An army under the generals Constans and Gerontius was sent to deal with this and Constantine&#x27;s authority was re-established. Honorius acknowledged Constantine as co-emperor in early 409 and Constantine immediately raised Constans to the position of augustus (emperor), theoretically equal in rank to Honorius as well as to Constantine. Later in 409 Gerontius rebelled, proclaimed his client Maximus emperor and incited barbarian groups in Gaul to rise up. Constans was sent to quash the revolt, but was defeated and withdrew to Arles. In 410, Constans was sent to Hispania again. Gerontius had strengthened his army with barbarians and defeated Constans; the latter withdrew north and was defeated again and killed at Vienne early in 411. Gerontius then besieged Constantine in Arles and killed him.

==Background==

Following the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I in 395 the Roman Empire was divided between his two sons: seventeen-year-old Arcadius became emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire and ten-year-old Honorius of the Western. Honorius was underage and the leading general Stilicho became hugely influential and the de facto commander-in-chief of the Roman armies in the west. Both the Eastern and Western Empires were suffering from incursions of large groups from Germanic tribes, whom the Romans referred to generically as &quot;barbarians&quot;. During this period Roman Britain was suffering raids by the Scoti, Saxons and Picts. In 401 or 402 Stilicho needed military manpower for wars with the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths and so stripped Hadrian&#x27;s Wall of troops.

==Prelude==

In 406 the approximately 6,000 troops of the Roman field army based in Roman Britain were dissatisfied. They had not been paid for several years, a large contingent had left to fight on the continent four years earlier and had not returned, the coastal defences had been dismantled to form the new field army and their commander had been replaced. They revolted and determined to choose their own leader. Their first choice was a man named Marcus whom they appointed emperor. After a short period, unhappy with his performance, they killed him and appointed Gratian. He also failed to meet the troops&#x27; expectations and was killed after four months. They next chose as their leader a man named after the famed emperor of the early fourth century, Constantine the Great, who had himself risen to power through a military coup in Britain. Flavius Claudius Constantinus was a common soldier and early in 407, possibly February, his fellows acclaimed him as emperor.

Rebellion in Roman Britain was not unusual, a contemporary described it as a &quot;province rich in usurpers&quot;. It was on the periphery of the Empire and there was a common view that it was overlooked in terms of resources and patronage. However, such revolts were usually short-lived; Constantine was uncommon in both establishing a lasting power base and in successfully exporting his rebellion to the mainland. Constantine moved quickly: he appointed generals in Gaul and crossed the Channel at Bononia (modern Boulogne). He took with him all of the 6,000 or so mobile troops left in Britain and their commander, the general Gerontius. The Roman Army of Gaul declared for him, followed by the civilian administration in Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal). The central Roman authorities did not respond to the Germanic invasion, while Constantine&#x27;s forces got the better of at least one confrontation with the Vandals. Constantine also negotiated agreements with the Germanic groupings of the Franks, Alamanni and the Burgundians, thus securing the line of the Rhine. The main Vandal force and their allies moved into northern Gaul (modern Belgium).
The Western Roman emperor, Honorius, and his commander-in-chief Stilicho, were in conflict with the Eastern Roman Empire and had a tenuous alliance with a large force of Visigoths under Alaric. Caught between different threats they sent a small army led by Sarus the Goth west to put down Constantine&#x27;s revolt while Stilicho&#x27;s main army waited on events. Sarus defeated one of Constantine&#x27;s armies in a pitched battle. Constantine then personally moved against Sarus, but was besieged in Valence. Another army, led by Gerontius and Edobichus and largely made up of freshly recruited Franks and Alamanni, arrived to relieve Valence after a week of siege. Sarus was forced to retreat into Italy. With this success Constantine established control over most of Gaul and the Alpine passes into Italy.

==Life==
===Caesar===
Little is known of Constans, the eldest son of Constantine, prior to his father being declared emperor. Constantine&#x27;s oldest son was a monk at the time his father rebelled, but he was summoned to the new imperial court. Constantine appointed him to the position of caesara senior, formal position that also recognised him as heir apparent. He was swiftly married so a dynasty could be founded. By May 408 Constantine had captured Arles and made it his capital, taking over the existing imperial administration and officials, and appointing Apollinaris as chief minister (with the title of ). Heros was installed as a pliant archbishop of Arles in spite of local opposition. Constantine commenced minting large quantities of good quality coins at Arles and made a show of being an equal of both the Western and Eastern Emperors.

Early in 408 Constans was sent with Gerontius and an army into Hispania. Hispania was a stronghold of the House of Theodosius, but on Constantine&#x27;s initial landing on the continent, Honorius&#x27;s partisans had been either unwilling or militarily unable to oppose his assumption of control. When Sarus seemed on the verge of ending Constantine&#x27;s revolt, two members of Honorius&#x27;s familyDidymus and Verinianusrebelled and overthrew Constantine&#x27;s regime in Hispania. When Sarus withdrew to Italy the knowledge of the large new army assembling at Ticinum with the intention of shortly engaging Constantine encouraged them to persist and even to attempt to seal the Pyrenean passes. Constantine feared that Honorius&#x27;s cousins would organise an attack from that direction while troops under Sarus and Stilicho attacked him from Italy in a pincer manoeuvre. He struck first, at Hispania. Constans and Gerontius&#x27;s army forced a pass and was reinforced. Constans established himself at Saragossa and rebuilt the civilian administration. Gerontius took the army and decisively defeated Honorius&#x27;s supporters at a battle in Lusitania where Didymus and Verinianus were captured. With Hispania back under Constantine&#x27;s control Constans left his new wife at Saragossa and returned to Arles to report to his father. Didymus and Verinianus accompanied him and were executed there as civilian rebels.

On 1 May 408 the emperor of the Eastern Empire, Arcadius, died, leaving a seven-year-old heir, Theodosius II. A disagreement arose between Stilicho and Honorius, who each wished to travel to Constantinoplethe capital of the Eastern Empireto represent the Western Empire&#x27;s interests. Stilicho got his way: he was to leave for the east while Honorius was to remain in Ravenna, the capital of the Western Empire. But a rift between him and Honorius was obvious. The Roman establishment, led by the senior bureaucrat Olympius, worked to oppose Stilicho by spreading rumours that he wished to travel east to depose Theodosius and set his own son, Eucherius, on the throne. On 13 August Honorius was formally reviewing the army about to set out from Ticinum against Constantine. With him were many of the senior officers and officials of the Western Empire. The troops mutinied, slaughtering Stilicho&#x27;s supporters but respecting the person of the Emperor. Stilicho sought sanctuary, then surrendered and was executed on 22 August.

===Co-emperor===
The native parts of the Army of Italy, encouraged by Olympius, started slaughtering Goths: the wives and children of their fellow soldiers who were living in Italian cities, sometimes overtly as hostages for their husbands and fathers&#x27; good behaviour, were easy targets. Those Goths who could fled north and joined Alaric, greatly increasing his fighting strength. Alaric promptly crossed the Alps and headed south through Italy, devastating the countryside. He camped his army outside Rome and demanded a huge ransom.
Late in 408 Constantine sent an embassy to Ravenna. Needing to placate him, Honorius acknowledged him as co-emperor and sent a purple robe as formal recognition. The pair were joint consuls for 409. At around this time Constantine raised Constans to the position of co-emperor, theoretically equal in rank to Honorius or Theodosius, as well as to Constantine. He took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Constans Augustus. Honorius continued to refuse to reach an agreement with Alaric. The Visigoths in retaliation continued to roam across Italy and extort vast sums from the city of Rome. Alaric elevated his own emperor, the senator Priscus Attalus, to no avail. On 24 August 410 the Visigoths entered Rome and pillaged the city for three days.

In spring or summer 409 Constans was sent back to Hispania. Either before Constans left Arles or while he was travelling, Gerontius rebelled and proclaimed his client Maximus emperor. Maximus was an important figure in his own right, but it was clear he was controlled by Gerontius. They set up court at Tarraco (modern Tarragona). Gerontius was concerned that he would not be able to withstand the military force Constans could bring to bear and so attempted to incite the barbarians who had entered Gaul late in 406 against Constantine. These had been quiescent in the north of the territory, but now set off across Gaul for the rich territories of Aquitaine and Narbonensis (modern southern and south-west France). They spread devastation across these areas, much to the horror of the populace. Concentrating on the threat from Constans, Gerontius weakened his garrisons in the Pyrenean passes and in autumn 409 much of the barbarian force entered Hispania. Eventually Gerontius was able to reach a modus operandi with some of these groups whereby they supplied him with military forces, which enabled him to take the offensive against Constans.

===Death===

Meanwhile, Constans, with an army commanded by a general named Justus, attempted to subdue Gerontius. He failed, although no details are known, and returned to Arles in spring 410. At about the same time Constantine returned from an abortive invasion of Italy. Given the difficulties the Visigoths were creating in Italy, Gerontius was considered a greater threat than Honorius. Edobichus was again sent north to raise troops from the Franks while Constans returned to confront Gerontius with a fresh army. Details are again unclear, but it seems likely that Gerontius was simultaneously advancing on Arles. The two armies clashed and Constans was defeated. He fell back to the north with what was left of his army, hoping to be reinforced by Edobichus. But Gerontius caught him at Vienne, probably early in 411, defeated his army and killed Constans. Gerontius&#x27;s army then marched on Arles and besieged Constantine.

==Aftermath==
In 411 Honorius appointed a new general, Flavius Constantius, who took the Army of Italy over the Alps and arrived at Arles while Gerontius was outside the city. Many of Gerontius&#x27;s troops deserted to Constantius and Gerontius withdrew to Hispania with the remainder. There, in a hopeless position, Gerontius committed suicide. Constantius&#x27;s army took over the siege. Meanwhile, Edobichus raised troops in northern Gaul amongst the Franks and Alamanni, combined them with those of the Army of Gaul still loyal to Constantine and marched to Constantine&#x27;s assistance. Constantius defeated this force in an ambush. Constantine, his hopes fading after the troops guarding the Rhine abandoned him to support yet another claimant to the imperial throne, the Gallic Roman Jovinus, surrendered to Constantius along with his surviving son Julian. Despite the promise of his life, and the assumption of clerical office, Constantius had the former soldier and Julian beheaded in either August or September 411. His head was mounted on a pole and presented to Emperor Honorius on 18 September.

Constantius withdrew in the face of Jovinus&#x27;s forces. In 413 a Visigoth army, now allied with Honorius, suppressed Jovinus&#x27;s revolt. Constantius took over Stilicho&#x27;s role as the main power in the Western Empire and generalissimo. He was broadly able to recover the situation for the central authorities and to enable reconstruction. Gaul was pacified, the barbarians in Hispania were in large part subdued, the Visigoths were settled on land in Aquitaine as Roman allies. Roman rule never returned to Britain after Constantine stripped its defences.

==Legend==
In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s popular and imaginative &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; Constantine III is also known as Constantine II of Britain and Constans is elected by the Britons as their king after Constantine&#x27;s death. Hence Constans, through his younger brother Uther Pendragon, becomes an uncle of the legendary King Arthur.

<text>The Rat Race is a 1960 American drama film adapted from the play of the same name by Garson Kanin. Directed by Robert Mulligan, it stars Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds as struggling young entertainment professionals in New York City. Filming took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. Sam Butera and Gerry Mulligan have minor roles as saxophonists.

== Plot ==
Wishing to pursue a career as a jazz saxophonist, Pete Hammond Jr. takes a bus from his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to New York City and optimistically begins looking for work. However, jobs are extremely hard to find. He crosses paths with Peggy Brown, a model and taxi dancer who has become jaded and cynical after years of struggling to survive in the city. She has just been evicted from an apartment rented to Pete, and because she is penniless and has no home to return to, he offers to let her stay with him. She is forced to rely on his generosity, and as the two of them work at various low-paying jobs, they stay together in the apartment as friends.

Peggy warns him that people cannot be trusted, but Pete is encouraged when a band auditions him for a job. When the other musicians send him out for beer, Pete returns to find that they have stolen his instruments and that he is the victim of a scam, thus proving Peggy right. Pete lands a job as an &quot;alto man&quot; on a cruise ship but has no instruments. Peggy goes to the abusive taxi dance hall owner she works for, Nellie Miller (Don Rickles), to whom she is already in debt, for another loan to give to Pete and agrees to prostitute herself with his patrons to pay back her debts. Maintaining a cynical front, Peggy convinces a suspicious Pete that she got the money with &quot;no strings attached&quot;.

Pete writes Peggy daily throughout the next month while on the cruise. When she stalls at fulfilling her end of their deal, Nellie strips Peggy of her dress and shoes to make his point that he owns her. She runs out on their deal again the night Pete returns, and Nellie threatens to disfigure her. In love with Peggy and afraid for her, Pete gives up all his wages, his wristwatch and his new instruments to pay off Nellie. Later, Pete professes his love to Peggy and they kiss; then he confesses to Peggy that he &quot;mixed&quot; with three women as part of his cruise ship job. Peggy agrees to stay with Pete, but then she tells him that he needs to stop working on cruise ships.

<doc id="835636" wikidata="Q1250303" url="?curid=835636" title="Dorothy Hart">
<text>Dorothy Hart (April 4, 1922 – July 11, 2004) was an American actress, mostly in supporting roles. She portrayed Howard Duff&#x27;s fiancée in the film &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948).

==Early life==
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Hart was the daughter of insurance executive Walter Hart and Mary Hart.

Hart attended Denison University for one year before graduating from Case Western Reserve University with a B.A. degree. She was also a member of Kappa Alpha Theta. After gaining some experience at the Cleveland Play House she decided on a singing career.

In 1944, a newspaper friend submitted her photo in the Columbia Pictures &quot;National Cinderella Cover Girl Contest of 1944.&quot; Hart had saved enough money to go to New York when she learned that she was high on the list of &quot;Cover Girl&quot; finalists. After winning the contest, the studio paid for her trip in August 1944, and she was given a screen test for the Rita Hayworth film &quot;Tonight and Every Night&quot;, as her contest award.

Winning the &quot;National Cinderella Cover Girl Contest&quot; brought with it a contract for Hart to be a model with the Conover Modeling Agency, which in turn led to pictures of her &quot;appearing in fashionable magazines all over the world.&quot;

She should not be confused with Dorothy Hart from the children&#x27;s soap opera “The Sunbrite Junior Nurse Corps.&quot; Although that Dorothy Hart was presented in Sunbrite&#x27;s advertising as a real person, she was played by Lucy Gilman Scott.

==Film career==
On August 25, 1946, Hart signed a contract with Columbia Pictures. Her first big movie break came, starring alongside Randolph Scott and Barbara Britton in the Western, &quot;Gunfighters&quot; (1947), a Cinecolor film for Columbia.

While filming in October, 1946 Hart was sent home from location with an illness which was diagnosed as influenza. In February, 1947 she was injured during horseback sequences in Arizona. Minor corrective surgery was performed at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, California. The Painted Desert was one of the main sites utilized for this movie. Barbara Britton played the female lead in the adventure drama with Hart heading up the supporting cast.

Columnist Hedda Hopper reported in a June 1947 column that Mary Pickford was suing Dorothy Hart for a sum of $79,000 because the young actress refused to accept a role in the film &quot;There Goes Lona Henry&quot;. Pickford stated in an interview that she hoped to take an unknown girl and make her into a great star. Hart refused the role because she did not want to sign away seven years of her career for a single movie opportunity.

Hart made &quot;Larceny&quot; (1948), with Shelley Winters and &quot;The Countess of Monte Cristo&quot; (also 1948) with Sonja Henie, both for Universal Pictures. She co-starred in &quot;The Naked City&quot;, starring Barry Fitzgerald, which premiered on March 10, 1948. She played the bad girl who double crosses her fiancé in William Castle&#x27;s &quot;Undertow&quot; (1949).

Hart became the tenth actress to portray Jane when she appeared opposite Lex Barker as Tarzan in &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Savage Fury&quot; (1952). She also co-starred in &quot;Outside the Wall&quot; (1950) and &quot;I Was a Communist for the FBI&quot; (1951), playing a Communist schoolteacher who eventually repudiates the party.

==United Nations==
In 1952, Hart left acting to work with the American Association for the United Nations in New York. The organization&#x27;s first female entertainer, she spoke at the United Nations and was an observer at the 1957-1958 meeting of the World Federation of United Nations in Geneva.

==Personal life==
Hart was twice married and divorced. With Frederick Pittera, she had a son, Douglas (born 1961).

Dorothy Hart died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on July 11, 2004, in Asheville, North Carolina, at age 82. She was survived by her son, a sister, and three grandchildren.

<text>Thomas Harris (1817? – November 29, 1884) was the first mayor of Victoria, British Columbia, serving from 1862 to 1865.

Born in Almeley, Herefordshire, Harris married Eliza Dickinson, a widow, in Liverpool in 1848. Harris came to Victoria by way of California in 1858, at the height of the Cariboo gold rush. He ran a slaughterhouse for a time, then became a butcher shortly afterward and made his fortune.

A jovial man who had an opinion on everything and wasn&#x27;t afraid to tell whoever would listen, he was a likely candidate for election in 1862 when the town&#x27;s father decided to incorporate the town. At election time, Harris won by &quot;forest of hands&quot; amid a group of 600 men. During his second official council meeting, the 300 pound (136 kg) Harris had a chair collapse under his own weight.

In 1873, he was named sergeant-at-arms for the provincial legislature. He was named high sheriff for Vancouver Island in 1876.

Harris Green, an area within Victoria, is named after him.

His stepson Robert Dickinson took over the shop in New Westminster and served as mayor of that city.

<text>Henry DeWitt Carey II (January 16, 1878 – September 21, 1947) was an American actor and one of silent film&#x27;s earliest superstars, usually cast as a Western hero. One of his best known performances is as the president of the United States Senate in the drama film &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was the father of Harry Carey Jr., who was also a prominent actor.

==Early life==

Carey was born in the Bronx, New York, a son of Henry DeWitt Carey (a newspaper source gives the actor&#x27;s name as &quot;Harry DeWitt Carey II&quot;), a prominent lawyer and judge of the New York Supreme Court, and his wife Ella J. (Ludlum). He grew up on City Island, Bronx.

Carey was a cowboy, railway superintendent, author, lawyer and playwright. He attended Hamilton Military Academy, then studied law at New York University.

==Stage==
When a boating accident led to pneumonia, he wrote a play, &quot;Montana&quot;, while recuperating and toured the country performing in it for three years. His play was very successful, but Carey lost it all when his next play was a failure. In 1911, his friend Henry B. Walthall introduced him to director D.W. Griffith, with whom Carey would make many films.

Carey&#x27;s Broadway credits include &quot;But Not Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Ah, Wilderness&quot;, and &quot;Heavenly Express&quot;.

==Career==
Carey first appeared in a film in 1908. He was contracted to make four films—not only acting but also doing his own stunt work. He is best remembered as one of the first stars of the Western film genre.

In 1909, Carey began working for the Biograph Company. In 1911, he was signed by D.W. Griffith. His first film for Griffith was &quot;The Sorrowful Shore&quot;, a sea story.

One of his most popular roles was as the good-hearted outlaw Cheyenne Harry. The Cheyenne Harry franchise spanned two decades, from &quot;A Knight of the Range&quot; (1916) to &quot;Aces Wild&quot; (1936). Carey starred in director John Ford&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Straight Shooting&quot; (1917).

Carey&#x27;s rugged frame and craggy features were well suited to westerns and outdoor adventures. When sound films arrived, Carey displayed an assured, gritty baritone voice that suited his rough-hewn screen personality. He was the logical choice for the title role in MGM&#x27;s outdoor jungle epic &quot;Trader Horn&quot;. By this time Carey, already in his fifties, was too mature for most leading roles, and the only starring roles that he was offered were in low-budget westerns and serials. He soon settled into a comfortable career as a solid, memorable character actor; he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the President of the Senate in the 1939 film &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. Among his other notable later roles were that of Master Sergeant Robert White, crew chief of the bomber &quot;Mary Ann&quot; in the 1943 Howard Hawks film &quot;Air Force&quot; and Mr. Melville, the cattle buyer, in Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Red River&quot;. Carey made his Broadway stage debut in 1940, in &quot;Heavenly Express&quot; with John Garfield.

Carey starred in a variety show produced at Treasure Island, the Navy base in San Francisco Bay, in May 1944. He &quot;thrilled the audience with his cowboy hit tunes&quot; on a show with a &quot;hillbilly theme a la swing&quot;--an odd promotional concept occasioned because the all-Black Navy band backing him up had become one of the most renowned swing bands in the area since arriving at Treasure Island in October 1943.

==Personal life==
Carey married at least twice and possibly a third time. Census records for 1910 indicate he had a wife named Clara Carey (nee Streat). Some references state that he was also married to an actress named Fern Foster.

His last marriage was in 1920 to actress Olive Fuller Golden, &quot;daughter of George Fuller Golden, one of the greatest of the vaudevillians.&quot; Harry and Olive were together until his death in 1947. They purchased a 1,000-acre ranch in Saugus, California, north of Los Angeles, which was later turned into Tesoro Adobe Historic Park in 2005.

The Careys had a son, Harry Carey, Jr., and a daughter, Ella &quot;Cappy&quot; Carey. Harry Jr., nicknamed Dobe, would become a character actor, most famous for his roles in westerns. Father and son both appear (albeit in different scenes) in the 1948 film &quot;Red River&quot;, and mother and son are both featured in 1956&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot;.

==Death==
A long-time cigar smoker, Harry Carey died in 1947 at the age of 69 from coronary thrombosis, which is believed to have been aggravated by a bite from a black widow spider a month earlier. However, more reliable sources refute the arachnid anecdote listed in contemporary Associated Press reports. Carey&#x27;s son blamed a combination of emphysema and cancer in his 1994 memoir &quot;Company of Heroes: My Life As an Actor in the John Ford Stock Company&quot;. In &quot;Print the Legend: The Life and Times of John Ford&quot;, author Scott Eyman states that lung cancer was the cause of death. He was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in the family mausoleum in the Bronx, New York.

==Honors and homages==

For his contributions to the film industry, Harry Carey has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1521 Vine Street. The star was dedicated February 8, 1960.

In the 1948 John Ford film, &quot;3 Godfathers&quot;, Carey is remembered at the beginning of the film and dubbed &quot;Bright Star of the early western sky...&quot;

As a homage to him, John Wayne held his right elbow with his left hand in the closing shot of &quot;The Searchers&quot;, imitating a stance Carey himself often used in his films. According to Wayne, both he and Carey&#x27;s widow Olive (who costarred in the film) wept when the scene was finished.

In 1976, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

In 1987, his name was emblazoned along the Walk of the Western Stars on Main Street in Old Town Newhall in Santa Clarita, California. (His son, Harry Carey Jr., was also honored in 2005.)

<doc id="835679" wikidata="Q2938977" url="?curid=835679" title="C. Paul Jennewein">
<text>Carl Paul Jennewein (December 2, 1890 – February 22, 1978) was a German-born American sculptor.

==Early career==
Jennewein was born in Stuttgart in Germany. At the age of seventeen, he immigrated to the United States in 1907.

He was apprenticed with the firm of Buhler and Lauter in New York where he received his early training. He took evening classes at the Art Students League of New York. Much of his early work was as a muralist, including in 1912 four murals for the Woolworth Building; the first building to be called &quot;the Cathedral of Commerce.&quot;

In 1915 Jennewein became a naturalized U.S. citizen when he was twenty-five years old. Soon afterward he entered the United States Army. In 1916 his tour was cut short when he was awarded an honorable discharge after receiving the Rome Prize, a highly sought-after art award. This allowed him to study at the American Academy in Rome for the next three years; in Rome Jennewein turned his attention to sculpture. By 1928, Jennewein had set up his studio in the Van Nest section of the Bronx where he remained until 1978, the year of his death.

==Later career==
The work that he is probably best known for today, and which garnered him much praise when it was unveiled in 1933, was the polychrome figures in the pediment of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Jennewein was one of 252 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International Exhibition of the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949.

In the course of their careers, Carl Paul Jennewein and his partner Warren Straton produced at least five monumental eagles: one at the entrance to Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, another on the Arlington Memorial Bridge, connecting Arlington with Washington, D.C., the third on the Federal Office Building in New York, the fourth, a Spanish–American War Memorial in Rochester, New York.

The fifth was at Ardennes Memorial located in Neuville-en-Condroz in Belgium. They also produced somewhat smaller eagles for the gates of the Embassy of the United States in Paris.

Jennewein&#x27;s sculpture, which never strayed too far from the classical ideals that he had come to so admire while in Rome, became increasingly modernized and his style comfortably fits into the Greco Deco category.

Jennewein&#x27;s work received some attention when his Noyes Armillary Sphere disappeared during a riot in Washington, D.C., in the turbulent 1960s. It has not yet been recovered.

He also executed a number of medals during his career. In 1933, Jennewein sculpted &quot;Glory and Fame&quot;, the seventh issue in the long running Society of Medalists series. He also designed the inaugural medal for President Harry S. Truman in 1949.

Jennewein died on February 22, 1978, at his home in Larchmont, New York.


==Controversy==
In 2002, two of Jennewein&#x27;s semi-nude figures in the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building in Washington, D.C., were hidden behind a curtain. This has been linked to the exposed breast on the female figure, &quot;Spirit of Justice&quot; (the male counterpart is &quot;Majesty of Law&quot;). The curtain was removed in 2005. 

Several posthumous profiles of Jennewein have brought attention to his participation in the Great German Art Exhibitions (Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung) in Munich in 1937, 1938, and 1939. The shows were held annually in the House of German Art (Haus der Deustchen Kunst) from 1937-1944 with direct oversight from Adolf Hitler. According to Head of Archive at Haus Der Kunst Sabine Brantl, which succeeded the Haus der Deutschen Kunst after the fall of the Nazi Germany, the exhibitions &quot;established an aesthetic and political space that served to implement and display&quot; the ideological goals of Nazism, including the construction of an Aryan supremacist racial hierarchy. Additionally, the exhibitions attempted to contrast with art that the Nazis had labeled as “degenerate” and purged from Germany. Artists exhibiting at the House of German Art were required to be members of the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts (Reichskulturkammer), which in turn could only be attained by submitting proof of &quot;Aryan descent&quot;. However, it is not known whether Jennewein was a member; he may have been granted an exception to the requirement.

Jennewein visited the Great German Art Exhibition in 1937 and came back very enthusiastic. In a letter d.d. 8 December 1937 to the American Architect Charles Borie, Jennewein writes: “I have just returned from a great trip, and I am still talking about the things I saw in Germany….I also feel that at last I have found out the answer to: &quot;&#x27;What is wrong with American Art’&quot;. In 1938 he was selected in Munich to a group of 25 preferred artist who were allowed to display yearly more than 5 artworks at the Great German Art Exhibitions. His displayed works, photographed by Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer), were printed on postcards issued by the House of German Art. Several works by Jennewein, identical to his bronzes displayed in the Third Reich, are currently displayed by American institutions, including Yale University and the Metropolitan. In 1938 Jennewein sold three bronzes to Adolf Hitler: &#x27;Tänzerin&#x27; (&#x27;Greek Dance&#x27;), &#x27;Rast&#x27; (Resting&#x27;) and &#x27;Komödie&#x27; (&#x27;Comedy&#x27;) for 600, 370, respectively 380 Reichsmark. After the war the US government apparently paid him almost 30,000 dollars compensation for the destruction of his art works bombed in Munich by Allied bombers.

==Recognition==
Because Jennewein&#x27;s studio was located in the Van Nest section of the Bronx, an honorary street sign was designated on June 2, 2011, to reflect his 50 years of contributions to the world of art and sculpture. Among those in attendance at the renaming ceremony were Jennewein&#x27;s son James and his wife. Additionally, representatives from the National Sculpture Society and Brookgreen Gardens also were present for the unveiling ceremony.

In 1929 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1933.

<doc id="835735" wikidata="Q1861210" url="?curid=835735" title="Thomas Nelson Page">
<text>Thomas Nelson Page (April 23, 1853 – November 1, 1922) was an American lawyer, politician, and writer. He served as the U.S. ambassador to Italy from 1913 to 1919 under the administration of President Woodrow Wilson during World War I.

In his writing, Page popularized Plantation tradition literature which was used to promote the Lost Cause myth across the New South. Page first got the public&#x27;s attention with his story &quot;Marse Chan&quot; which was published in the &quot;Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine&quot;. Page&#x27;s most notable works include &quot;The Burial of the Guns&quot; and &quot;In Ole Virginia.&quot;

==Life and career==

Page was born on one of the Nelson family&#x27;s plantations, Oakland, near the village of Beaverdam in Hanover County, Virginia. He was the son to John Page, a lawyer and a plantation owner, and Elizabeth Burwell (Nelson). He was a scion of the prominent Nelson and Page families, each First Families of Virginia.

Although he was from once-wealthy lineage, after the American Civil War, which began when he was only 8 years old, his parents and their relatives were largely impoverished during Reconstruction and his teenage years.

In 1869, he entered Washington College, known now as Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia when Robert E. Lee was president of the college. In Page&#x27;s later literary works, Robert E. Lee would come to serve as the model figure of Southern Heroism. Page left Washington College before graduation for financial reasons after three years, but continued to desire an education specifically in law. To earn money to pay for his degree, Page tutored the children of his cousins in Kentucky. From 1873 to 1874, he was enrolled in the law school of the University of Virginia. At Washington College and thereafter at UVA, Nelson was a member of the fraternity of Delta Psi, (St. Anthony Hall).

== Career ==
Admitted to the Virginia Bar Association, he practiced as a lawyer in Richmond between 1876 and 1893, and also began his writing career. In 1893, Page, who had become disillusioned with the Southern legal system, gave up his practice entirely and moved with his wife to Washington, D.C.

There, he wrote eighteen books that were compiled and published in 1912. Page popularized the plantation tradition genre of Southern writing, which told of an idealized version of life before the Civil War, with contented slaves working for beloved masters and their families. Page viewed the Antebellum South as a representation of moral purity, and often vilified the reforms of the Gilded Age as a sign of moral decline.

His 1887 collection of short stories, &quot;In Ole Virginia&quot;, is Page&#x27;s quintessential work, providing a depiction of the Antebellum South. His most well-known short-story from that collection was &quot;Marse Chan&quot;. &quot;Marse Chan&quot; was popularized because of Page&#x27;s ability to capture southern dialect. Another short-story collection of his is entitled &quot;The Burial of the Guns&quot; (1894). As a result of his literary success, Page was popular amongst the Capital elite, and was regularly invited to socialize with politicians from around the country. During the first quarter of the 20th century, he founded a library in the Sycamore Tavern structure near Montpelier, Virginia, in memory of his wife, Florence Lathrop Page.

Under President Woodrow Wilson, Page was appointed as U.S. ambassador to Italy for six years between 1913 and 1919. There he supported the Czechoslovak Legion in Italy. Despite being untrained in Italian and having little experience in governmental affairs, Page was determined to do a good job. He eventually learned Italian, formed beneficial relationships with Italian government officials, and accurately reported on the Italian state during World War I. Page managed to maintain and improve American-Italian relations during World War I, and provided a sympathetic ear to the Italian and Triple Entente cause in the U.S. government. After a disagreement with President Wilson over the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, in which he argued for increased Italian benefits, Page resigned his post in 1919. His book entitled &quot;Italy and the World War&quot; (1920) is a memoir of his service there.

After returning to his home in Oakland, Virginia, Page continued to write for the remainder of his years.

==Writing themes==

Page&#x27;s postbellum fiction featured a nostalgic view of the South in step with what is termed Lost Cause ideology. Twisting the historical reality of slavery, enslaved people are depicted as faithful, happy and simple, slotted into a paternalistic society. For example, the formerly enslaved person in &quot;Marse Chan&quot; is uneducated, speaks phonetically, and has unrelenting admiration for his former master. The gentry are noble and principled, with fealty to country and to chivalry—they seem like knights of a different age. The strain epitomized by Page would carry through the postwar era, cropping up again in art with films like &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. The ideology and thoughts that appear in Page&#x27;s writing and in Southern ideology are no mere simplistic, archaic world-view; they are part of a complex history that has informed, for worse and for better, the evolution of the Southern mind to 1940.

Thomas Nelson Page lamented that the slavery-era &quot;good old darkies&quot; had been replaced by the &quot;new issue&quot; (Blacks born after slavery) whom he described as &quot;lazy, thriftless, intemperate, insolent, dishonest, and without the most rudimentary elements of morality&quot; (pp. 80, 163). Page, who helped popularize the images of cheerful and devoted Mammies and Sambos in his early books, became one of the first writers to introduce a literary black brute.

In 1898 he published &quot;Red Rock&quot;, a Reconstruction novel, with the heinous figure of Moses, a loathsome and sinister Black politician. Moses tried to rape a white woman: &quot;He gave a snarl of rage and sprang at her like a wild beast&quot; (pp. 356–358). The depiction of rape using animal metaphors was a common feature of American sentimental literature. He was later lynched for &quot;a terrible crime&quot;.

Page dealt with the morality of lynching by acquitting the mob from any guilt, holding, instead, the supposedly debased Blacks responsible for their own violent executions. In his 1904 essay, &quot;The Negro: The Southerner&#x27;s Problem&quot;, he advocated for the white man&#x27;s right to lynch:

Likewise, Thomas Nelson Page complained that African American leaders should cease &quot;talk of social equality that inflames the ignorant Negro,&quot; and instead, work to stop &quot;the crime of ravishing and murdering women and children.&quot;

==Reception and criticism==
Thomas Nelson Page was one of the best-known writers of his day. He served as Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s ambassador to Italy, and the president referred to him as a &quot;national ornament&quot;.

In her effort to control the image of slavery and Civil War in the American mind, Mildred Lewis Rutherford, historian general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy from 1911 to 1916, urged that &quot;no library should be without…all of Thomas Nelson Page&#x27;s books&quot;.

Modern historian David W. Blight calls it &quot;America&#x27;s national tragedy&quot; that American memory was informed by the &quot;romantic fantasies&quot; of writers like Page and Joel Chandler Harris, while the authentic memories of former slaves were largely forgotten. He approvingly cites Sterling A. Brown&#x27;s ironical criticism: &quot;Thomas Nelson Page was not lying in his eulogy of the mammy…Page&#x27;s feeling is honest if child-like. I am sure that he loved his mammy to death.&quot;

== Personal life ==
He was married to Anne Seddon Bruce on July 28, 1886. She died on December 21, 1888, of a throat hemorrhage. He remarried on June 6, 1893, to Florence Lathrop Field, a daughter of Jedediah Hyde Lathrop and the widowed sister-in-law of retailer Marshall Field (her husband Henry Field had died less than three years earlier). Page&#x27;s second wife Florence was a member of the prestigious Barbour family, making Page a member by marriage. Their wedding was held at the Elmhurst, Illinois Byrd&#x27;s Nest estate of Thomas Barbour Bryan and his wife Jennie Byrd Bryan (). Thomas Barbour Bryan was Florence&#x27;s maternal uncle, while Jennie Byrd Bryan was distant cousins with Mr. Page (meaning that the Bryans&#x27; children –Jennie and Thomas– were both distant relatives of both Nelson Page, and first cousins of his second wife).

Page was an activist in stimulating the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities to mobilize to save historical sites at Yorktown and elsewhere, especially in the Historic Triangle of Virginia, from loss to development. He was involved in gaining Federal funding to build a seawall at Jamestown in 1900, protecting a site where the remains of James Fort were later discovered by archaeologists working on the Jamestown Rediscovery project.

He died in 1922 at the age of 69 at Oakland, Virginia in Hanover County, Virginia.

<text>[[Sir]] Charles Hayward (May 12, 1839 – July 8, 1919) was the 25th mayor of Victoria, British Columbia, from 1900–1902. He had one of the more unusual professions: Starting off as a carpenter, he went into the business of making coffins and turned that into a very successful funeral business, one which remains today. Hayward&#x27;s son Reginald also served as mayor (1922–1924) and continued to expand the business. They remain the only father and son mayors in Victoria history.

He was born in Stratford, Essex, England, the son of Charles Hayward and Harriet Tomlinson. He apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner and came to Victoria, British Columbia in 1862. He first entered the contracting business and then, in 1867, became an undertaker. Hayward was also involved in mining, building and manufacturing. He served as an alderman in 1873, 1874 and 1899 and was also chairman of the school board and a justice of the peace. Hayward married Sarah Chesney in 1862. He died in 1919 in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of 80.

<doc id="835743" wikidata="Q7401574" url="?curid=835743" title="Saint Joseph the Worker Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)">
<text>Saint Joseph the Worker Catholic Church is a Catholic parish located in Dubuque, Iowa. It is part of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. The parish became the tenth Catholic parish in Dubuque when it was created in 1949 by Archbishop Rohlman. The current pastor of the parish is Brian M. Dellaert.

== History ==

Prior to the construction of the first church, the parish offices were located at Mercy Hospital. Weekend masses were held at Washington Junior High School. Eventually a parish church was built at the current location at 90 S. Algona, Dubuque.

In 1967, a new parish church was built, in a mid-century modern style. The church was a circular structure where the congregation sat in a semicircle around the altar. The church is noted for its stained glass windows, designed by Robert Leader.

Originally, the parish was named Saint Joseph&#x27;s Church. There was another Saint Joseph&#x27;s parish about three miles away, in Key West, Iowa. At times, one of the two parishes would receive mail intended for the other parish. In order to distinguish between the two parishes, the name was changed to St. Joseph the Worker parish in the 1990s. The parish is one of the larger parishes in Dubuque, mainly because of its location near the west end of the city.

The church was vandalized and damaged by arson in 2003. Anti-religious graffiti was found on the walls, as was a number of beer cans. A fire was found to have been burning on the main altar. The church sustained about $100,000 worth of damage. The next day, the pastor removed the Eucharist from the building. The building was then cleaned and repaired by a company that specialized in repairing and cleaning fire damaged buildings. A nearby Methodist church that had moved to a new facility donated their old church building while cleaning and repairs were being done. A young man whose family belonged to the parish had eventually confessed to the crime, he had committed it after a night of drinking and drug use.

<text>Play Your Cards Right (or Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Play Your Cards Right) is a British television game show based on, and played similarly to, the American show &quot;Card Sharks&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot; broadcast on ITV from 1 February 1980 to 22 November 1987, produced by LWT, and hosted by Bruce Forsyth. LWT produced a more modern version from 18 March 1994 to 4 June 1999, initially expected to be presented by Brian Conley, who filmed a pilot show before Forsyth was lured back after he unexpectedly quit &quot;The Generation Game&quot;. In 2002, Forsyth hosted another revival, with slightly modified rules. This version was produced by Thames Television and ended on 20 June 2003.

Forsyth also presented a parody of the format, &quot;Play Your Iraqi Cards Right&quot; (working title: &quot;Play Your Kurds Right&quot;), when he was guest host on the satirical BBC TV series &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in June 2003. On 15 October 2005, it made a one-off return as part of &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot;, celebrating 50 years of ITV. It made another one-off return in 2007 again part of &quot;Gameshow Marathon.&quot;

An interactive DVD game of &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot; was released in 2007, with an updated sequel released in 2008, both produced by DVDPro.

==Format==

===Main game===
Two couples (two single players during the first series) alternated who went first on each question. The questions were based on surveys of 100 people. The first couple would guess how many of the 100 gave a certain answer to the question, and the second would guess whether the actual number was higher or lower than the other couple&#x27;s guess. (If the first couple guessed exactly the number of people, they would win a case of champagne, as opposed to a cash bonus depending on type of question on the US versions ($100 for 10-person surveys with another $100 split among the panel, $500 for 100-person surveys or general knowledge questions.) Whoever was correct gained control of the cards.

Unlike the US version, the questions usually had some comedy value (for example: The question would be, &quot;We asked 100 tattoo-artists – if somebody came in asking for a tattoo of Bruce Forsyth, would you try to talk them out of it?, how many tattoo-artists said yes, if somebody came in asking for a tattoo of Bruce Forsyth, they would try to talk them out of it?&quot;. The first couple would joke around with Bruce, and then decide on a sum of, say, 64. The second couple would say &quot;higher&quot; (and Bruce would pretend to be offended). If the answer was, say, 26, the second couple were wrong in guessing &quot;higher&quot;, so the first couple started with the cards.

There were five cards for each team laid out, and they had to guess if the next card was higher or lower — ace being the highest card, and two being lowest. The first card could be changed if the couple wished. If the guess was correct, the couple would continue with the next card, and so on. Correctly guessing all cards to the end won the game, but if the couple guessed wrong at any time or if they got a pair of cards, they would retreat back to the card where they started and the other team would have a free attempt at their own cards. (In this case, the couple could not change their first card.)

After any correct guess, a couple could &quot;freeze&quot;, which would protect their cards. A marker would be placed by a dealer beside the frozen card, which meant that on the next question, a wrong guess on their cards would put them back no further than where they froze. This was usually done when the card shown was of a middle rank, such as a seven, eight or nine. After a couple froze their cards, play would continue to the next question. Should the couple regain control of the board on a correct question, they will be allowed to change the frozen card (due to it now being the card the couple would start on.).

If the next card was the same rank as the card showing, it counted as a wrong guess; indeed, this is the only way to be wrong when an ace or deuce appeared. &quot;You don&#x27;t get anything for a pair, not in this game&quot; was Forsyth&#x27;s catch phrase on such occasions.

If no team had managed to predict the last card correctly within the first three questions sudden death was played. The couple who gained control of the cards (either through their own correct prediction or the other couple&#x27;s incorrect prediction) had to make a decision, either to &quot;Play&quot; and correctly predict the remainder of their cards to win, or &quot;Pass&quot; and force their opponents to achieve the feat. An incorrect prediction now caused their opposition to win the round.

In series 1, each game awarded £50 to the winner. By 1985, the winner of each of the two games in the first half would get a prize known as a &quot;Brucie Bonus&quot;. The overall winner was the first couple to win two games. If a third game was required, three cards were played by each couple instead of five, with sudden death occurring on the third question instead of fourth. Also around the time a gift of a bottle of champagne was given to a couple in the rare instances where they correctly guessed the exact answer of a question.

;Prize cards
The winning couple got 200 points to begin with. Bruce would then ask a question, if they got it right, they&#x27;d win an extra 50 points, if they got it wrong, they lost 50 points. There were two rows of three cards dealt out (going from left to right, and upward), and one final card at the top. At the start of the bottom row, they had the chance to change their base card. At the start of the second row, they got an extra 200 points, and they had the chance to change the card. The rules are the same as in the previous game, but they had to bet on each turn of the card with a minimum bet of 50 points, or up to the number of points they have at that time. When they got to the final card, the couple&#x27;s score determined the prize they played for. If they had 4,000 or more, they could play for the car (which was a separate game on the US version). They were asked a simple question (usually to name 5 of something – no-one ever got this wrong), and then predicted higher or lower for the final card, after given the chance to change the card. If they were right, they would win the car. If not, they won a prize based on their score. A score of less than 4,000 points after finishing the second row required a bet of at least half of the points.

In the 90&#x27;s version, points became pounds, but the rules remained the same. Also, on the final card, if they had £4,000 or more, and they were wrong, they would just have the money. What was emphasized was that their money was safe.

If the couple got to the final card with under £4,000, they could choose to take the money, or gamble all of it on the last card – with Bruce emphasising thus: &quot;The rules are strict here – it is all or nothing&quot; (unlike all US versions which required players to bet one-half or more of their winnings on the final card, allowing players to bet the minimum one-half if they were not confident because of a middle card; the 2019 US version added the option of taking the money before the final card from this version, regardless of the amount won, with the one-half minimum bet still in effect if they went on). The maximum amount of money that could be won was £17,600, which was never achieved. (The highest win was £9,500)

===2002 version===
The rules of the 2002 revival were partly based on the changes made in the 2001 revival of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; in the United States. All 13 cards from the suit of hearts from the &#x27;Two&#x27; to the &#x27;Ace&#x27; were put out face down. Four couples would then come on, and the two couples with the two highest cards would go through to the main game (the couple who picked the highest card was red team.). This was just an opening game. After this, Bruce&#x27;s gag was to say &quot;Well done you winners, and so sorry losers, we really are sorry to lose you so early in the show...tough.&quot; – followed by audience laughter. The rules of the main game were exactly the same as in the original version, except the &quot;Brucie Bonus&quot; was £1,000. If one couple won both the games, the losing couple would be sent home with a case of champagne before the break, otherwise, the losing couple would get to keep the £1,000 for winning their one-game (there was no money awarded for the tie-breaker).

In the Cash Cards, Bruce would first ask the winning couple a ridiculously hard, trivial or stupid question. They often pondered for a few seconds over this, then Bruce said &quot;Aren&#x27;t you glad you don&#x27;t have to answer a question like that?&quot;, to which the audience would laugh – except that on at least two occasions, the contestants correctly answered the question, shocking Bruce, who accused the contestants – though in a humorous manner – of &quot;ruining the show&quot;, prompting &quot;much more&quot; laughter from the audience.

The Cash Cards game was played similar to the United States versions from 1980-81 season and also the entire 1986-89 version&#x27;s run. The couple was given £1,000 to start with and their minimum bet had to be £100, but they could bet the whole lot if they wanted to. If the couple survived the first three cards, another £500 would be added to the total on the fourth card. On the final card, the couple had to bet at least half the amount they had at that point. If a couple bet on the whole lot the wrong way during the first three cards, that card would be put on the row above and the additional £500 would be added on. If there was a pair revealed in the Cash Cards, &quot;push&quot; rule that had been implemented in the aforementioned US versions was in play, as they moved on to the next card without losing any money. If the last two cards on a row were a pair, the second card would be used as the base card for the row above.

The theoretical maximum in the Cash Cards is £136,000.

===Personnel===
Among Forsyth&#x27;s other quips, he would, at the beginning of some shows, say, &quot;What a lovely audience! You&#x27;re so much better than last week.&quot; The joke was that the same audience was used for more than one show, therefore it was the same one. Bruce started each show with his trademark &quot;It&#x27;s nice to see you, to see you nice&quot; (whereby the audience join in on the last &quot;nice&quot;.). When a pair was revealed, he&#x27;d say &quot;You don&#x27;t get anything for a pair, not in this game.&quot;, and the audience would join in with the &quot;not in this game&quot; part. On the 2002 series in particular, he would often start the show with a made-up quote.

When &quot;Card Sharks&quot; was slated for a revival in 1986, Forsyth himself was considered as possible host by creator/producer Mark Goodson (Forsyth, at the time, was in the United States filming the short-lived &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Hot Streak&quot;). The job ultimately went to Bob Eubanks and Bill Rafferty.

Card dealers include Jo Thomas, Yvonne Younger, Zena Clifton, Natalie Shaw, Denise &quot;Denni&quot; Kemp, Lesley Anderson, Gillian Elvins, John Melainey, Camilla Blair, Gillian Duxbury, Alison Bell, Carol Dean, Brenda Haldane, Wendy Marler, Robin Martyne, Denni Kemp, Natalie van de Braam, Alison Bell, Carol Dean, Vicki Brattle, Sophie Allisstone, Carly Carter, Debbie Flett, Sharon Amos, Sheryl Deane, Charlie Maloney, Maxine Restall, Annalise Braakensiek and Vicki-Lee Walberg.

==&quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot;==
&quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot; was one of the games on the series &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; in 2005 and 2007.

==Potential revivals==
In 2011, a new pilot was made for a planned reboot of &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot; on ITV with Vernon Kay as the new host. However, in November 2013, it was later scrapped because it &quot;didn&#x27;t involve enough skill&quot;. In June 2019 it was announced that, as one of the country&#x27;s five all-time favourite game shows, it would be &quot;supersized and rebooted&quot; in a new series &quot;Alan Carr&#x27;s Epic Gameshow&quot; filmed at dock10 studios for broadcast on ITV. Hosted by Alan Carr, the new episode was a celebrity special and was broadcast on 30 May 2020 as the first episode in the series. Carr had been linked to a possible revival of the show in August 2018. In 2020 presenter Ryan Swain revived the gameshow digitally via his Instagram attracting celebrity guests daily; it was to set up to entertain the NHS staff, carers and key workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="835763" wikidata="Q4923150" url="?curid=835763" title="Blackmans Bay, Tasmania">
<text>Blackmans Bay is a coastal suburb of Kingborough Council, Tasmania, Australia. It forms part of the Kingston-Blackmans Bay urban area and is a satellite town of Greater Hobart. It borders Kingston Beach to the north, Maranoa Heights and the Peter Murrell Conservation Area to the west and Howden and Tinderbox to the south.

==Etymology==
Blackmans Bay is named after James Blackman, who occupied land there in the 1820s. Another &quot;Blackman Bay&quot;, near Dunalley (also in Tasmania) was so named in 1642 because of the presence of Aboriginal Tasmanians.

==Geography==
Blackmans Bay is located on the hills surrounding a popular sandy beach.

There is a blowhole near the northern end of the beach, which has eroded and forms a large rock arch where waves can be seen coming in and crashing on the rocks. James Baynton is credited with the discovery of the blowhole when he found his lost dog whimpering at its base.

At the southern end of the beach are rocks leading to Flowerpot Point, a popular spot for fishing, although snags are an issue because of the prevalence of seaweed and rock ledges beneath the water. Beyond Flowerpot Point lies a quiet pebble beach that is accessible at low tide. The Suncoast Headlands walking track leads south via clifftops to Soldiers Rocks, dog exercise area and bushland loop walking track.

At the southern boundary of the suburb lies Fossil Cove, accessible via a steep walking track from Fossil Cove Drive.

==Infrastructure==
Blackmans Bay has three primary schools from kindergarten to grade six: Blackmans Bay, Illawarra, established in the late 1980s, and the Catholic St. Aloysius. 

The shopping centre Bayview Market, located centrally within the suburb, includes a supermarket, newsagency, doctor&#x27;s surgery, pharmacy and a variety of other stores.

Blackmans Bay also has a set of three restaurants near the shore.

==History==
The 1830 &quot;Ross Almanack&quot; describes Blackmans Bay as &quot;[...] several small farms. It is a very romantically situated little settlement with a fine sandy beach in front. The potatoes that grow there are as celebrated as those of Brown&#x27;s River.&quot; The only families referenced in the text are the Mansfields and the Lovetts. The signal station &quot;Mount Lewis&quot; is said to be located next to the Lovett household.

Despite knowledge of the Bay&#x27;s existence it was settled relatively late, and by 1842 only four or five families lived in the area. The road from Hobart reached Brown&#x27;s River and ended in Kingston Beach, with only a sandy track over the hill connecting Kingston Beach and Blackmans Bay. One of the earliest settlers was William Sherburd who was granted 50 acres there in 1818, which he started farming in 1819. The existing oval at Blackmans Bay bears Sherburd&#x27;s name.

Blackmans Bay did not develop as quickly as Brown&#x27;s River or Kingston Beach, as the lack of a road or jetty made it difficult to access. Therefore the area enjoyed little development between 1830 and 1880, with farmland growth but little change in population. There were still few residents by the 1930s, with only the following six families listed as residing in the area: Ranger, Parson, Ayres, Sherburd, Chamberlain and Keeble. The area enjoyed greater growth during the post-war period. At the beginning of 1947 there were 57 families in the area, and by the end of the year there were 343.

<doc id="835766" wikidata="Q1484412" url="?curid=835766" title="Providence Reds">
<text>The Providence Reds were a hockey team that played in the Canadian-American Hockey League (CAHL) between 1926 and 1936 and the American Hockey League (AHL) from 1936 to 1977, the last season of which they played as the Rhode Island Reds. The team won the Calder Cup in 1938, 1940, 1949, and 1956. The Reds played at the Rhode Island Auditorium, located on North Main Street in Providence, Rhode Island, from 1926 through 1972, when the team affiliated with the New York Rangers and moved into the newly built Providence Civic Center. The team name came from the breed of chicken known as the Rhode Island Red.

When the North American Hockey League folded in 1977, the Broome Dusters acquired the Reds franchise and moved them to Binghamton, New York, where they were known as the Binghamton Dusters, Binghamton Whalers, and Binghamton Rangers. In 1997 the franchise was sold to Madison Square Garden and then moved to become the Hartford Wolf Pack. On November 27, 2010, they were renamed the Connecticut Whale to honor the NHL&#x27;s Hartford Whalers; but changed their name back to the Wolf Pack in 2013. It is the oldest continuously operating minor-league hockey franchise in North America, having fielded a team in one form or another since 1926 in the CAHL. It is also the only AHL franchise to have never missed a season.

The AHL returned to Providence in 1992 in the form of the Providence Bruins. Formed in 2001, The Rhode Island Reds Heritage Society commemorates the existence of the franchise and keeps the memory alive. Their pinnacle event is an annual reunion that takes place during the first weekend in August.

<text>Alan Lowe (born July 26, 1961) is a Canadian politician. He served as mayor of Victoria, British Columbia, 1999–2008.

== Education ==
In 1982 Lowe earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in environmental studies from the University of Manitoba, and in 1985 he earned a master&#x27;s degree in architecture from the University of Oregon.

== Politics ==
Alan Lowe was the city&#x27;s first mayor of Chinese heritage to be elected. At 38 years old he was also one of the youngest candidates ever to win Victoria&#x27;s mayoral election.

In 1999 Alan Lowe managed to win a hard-fought three-way race versus Bob Friedland of the Victoria Civic Electors on the left and veteran right wing councilor Geoff Young. His campaign slogan was &quot;Aim High, Vote Lowe&quot;.

=== 1999 Election Results ===
* Alan LOWE 7,080 43.59%
* Bob FRIEDLAND 5,626 34.64%
* Geoff YOUNG 3,076 18.94%

The accepted opinion in the next election was that Lowe was unassailable and therefore no serious candidates chose to challenge him. He handily won the 2002 election (61.65% of the popular vote) against a number of opponents, including his closest contender, Ben Isitt, then a 24-year-old master&#x27;s student at the University of Victoria.

Alan Lowe won re-election in the 2005 elections. He again faced Ben Isitt and defeated him by 1,400 votes. Lowe&#x27;s completion of the new police headquarters building and the Save On Foods Memorial Centre were very positive for his public relations. The arena project was not finished under the tenure of his predecessor mayor, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Cross, former owner of Cross Meat Market.

In the December 5, 2007, edition of the &quot;Victoria Times Colonist&quot; newspaper, Lowe stated that he would like to spend more time with his family, friends, other interests and would not seek re-election. He served on Victoria City Council for 15 years as a councillor and mayor.

<doc id="835821" wikidata="Q436062" url="?curid=835821" title="Billy Mills">
<text>William Mervin Mills (born June 30, 1938), also known by his Oglala Lakota name Tamakhóčhe Theȟíla, is an American Oglala Lakota former track and field athlete who won a gold medal in the 10,000 metre run (6.2 mi) at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. His 1964 victory is considered one of the greatest Olympic upsets because he was a virtual unknown going into the event. He was the first non-European to win the Olympic event and remains the only winner from the Americas. He was also a United States Marine officer.

==Early life and education==
William Mervin Mills was born in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, and was raised on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation for Oglala Lakota people. His Lakota name, &quot;Tamakhóčhe Theȟíla&quot;, loosely means &quot;loves his country&quot; or &quot;respects the earth.&quot; He was orphaned when he was twelve years old. Mills took up running while attending the Haskell Institute, which is now known as Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas where he won the 1956 KSHSAA Class B State Championship in Cross Country. Mills was both a boxer and a runner in his youth, but he gave up boxing to focus on running.

He attended the University of Kansas on an athletic scholarship and was a three-time NCAA All-America cross-country runner. In 1960 he won the individual title at the Big Eight cross-country championship. While he competed at Kansas, the track team won the 1959 and 1960 outdoor national championships.

After graduating in 1962 with a degree in physical education, Mills entered the United States Marine Corps. He was a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserve when he competed in the 1964 Olympics.

According to some sources, Mills never owned his own pair of new shoes until the night before the Olympic Games.

==1964 Olympics==
Mills qualified for the 1964 Summer Olympics on the U.S. Track and Field Team in the 10,000 metres and the marathon. The favorite in 1964 for the 10,000 m was Ron Clarke of Australia, who held the world record. The runners expected to challenge him were defending champion Pyotr Bolotnikov of the Soviet Union, and Murray Halberg of New Zealand, who had won the 5,000 m in 1960.

Mills was largely unknown as a runner. He had finished second to Gerry Lindgren in the U.S. Olympic trials. His time in the heats was a minute slower than Clarke&#x27;s. Clarke set the tone of the race by using a tactic of surging every other lap. Halfway through the race, only four runners were still with Clarke: Mohammed Gammoudi of Tunisia, Mamo Wolde of Ethiopia, Kokichi Tsuburaya of Japan, and Mills. Tsuburaya, the local favorite, lost contact first, then Wolde. With two laps to go, only two runners were still with Clarke. He had run a world record time of 28:15.6, while neither Gammoudi nor Mills had previously run under 29 minutes.

Mills and Clarke were running together, with Gammoudi immediately behind, as they entered the final lap. They were lapping other runners, and Clarke was boxed in down the backstretch. He pushed Mills once, then again. Then Gammoudi pushed them both and surged into the lead as they rounded the final curve. Clarke recovered and began chasing Gammoudi while Mills appeared to be too far back to be in contention. Clarke failed to catch Gammoudi, but Mills pulled out to lane 4 and sprinted past them both. His winning time of 28:24.4 was almost 50 seconds faster than he had run before and set a new Olympic record for the event. No American had before won the 10,000 m, nor has any other American come close until Galen Rupp took the silver in the 2012 London Olympics.

American television viewers were able to hear the surprise and drama as NBC expert analyst Dick Bank screamed &quot;Look at Mills! Look at Mills!&quot; over the more sedate play-by-play announcer Bud Palmer, who seemed to miss what was unfolding. For bringing drama to the coverage, Bank was fired, as it was considered improper at the time.

After the race, Mills talked with Clarke and asked if he was straining as hard as he could on the final straight to the finish, to which Clarke replied, &quot;Yes&quot;. Mills has stated that he tried to be relaxed during his final kick to the finish line and felt that helped him pass both Gammoudi and Clarke. Both Clarke and Mills ran the marathon after the 10,000 m event. Clarke finished in 9th place, and Mills finished in 14th, in 2:22:55.4, approximately two-and-a-half minutes behind Clarke, six-and-a-half minutes behind bronze medalist Tsuburaya and about 10 minutes behind winner Abebe Bikila.

==Post-Olympics==

Mills later set U.S. records for 10,000 m (28:17.6) and the three-mile run, and had a 5,000 m best of 13:41.4. In 1965, he and Gerry Lindgren both broke the world record for the six-mile run when they finished in a tie at the AAU National Championships, running 27:11.6.

==Post-running career==
Mills is the co-founder of the nonprofit Running Strong for American Indian Youth with Eugene Krizek. The aim of Running Strong is to help Native American people fulfill their basic needs – food, water, and shelter – while also helping their communities gain self-sufficiency and self-esteem. He now acts as a spokesperson for the organization and travels the country empowering Native youth and encouraging them to follow their dreams. Mills&#x27; charity work also includes diabetes prevention and management education for adults and especially for youth. Mills himself is Type 2 diabetic and helps people with diabetes learn how to maintain a healthy lifestyle and improve their lives.

Mills co-wrote a book with Nicholas Sparks, &quot;Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Self-Understanding&quot; and wrote another, &quot;Lessons of a Lakota&quot;, made speaking tours, and sponsored some events. He lives near Sacramento, California.

==In film and television==
Mills is the subject of the 1983 movie &quot;Running Brave&quot;, in which he is portrayed by Robby Benson. He is also one of several athletes featured on the August 18, 2016, &quot;On Being&quot; episode &quot;Running as a Spiritual Practice&quot;.

<text>In formal language theory, the empty string, or empty word, is the unique string of length zero.

==Formal theory==
Formally, a string is a finite, ordered sequence of characters such as letters, digits or spaces. The empty string is the special case where the sequence has length zero, so there are no symbols in the string.
There is only one empty string, because two strings are only different if they have different lengths or a different sequence of symbols.
In formal treatments, the empty string is denoted with ε or sometimes Λ or λ.

The empty string should not be confused with the empty language ∅, which is a formal language (i.e. a set of strings) that contains no strings, not even the empty string.

The empty string has several properties:
* |ε| = 0. Its string length is zero.
* ε ⋅ s = s ⋅ ε = s. The empty string is the identity element of the concatenation operation. The set of all strings forms a free monoid with respect to ⋅ and ε.
* εR = ε. Reversal of the empty string produces the empty string, so the empty string is a palindrome.
* formula_1. Statements that are about all characters in a string are vacuously true.
* The empty string precedes any other string under lexicographical order, because it is the shortest of all strings.

In context-free grammars, a production rule that allows a symbol to produce the empty string is known as an ε-production, and the symbol is said to be &quot;nullable&quot;.

==Use in programming languages==
In most programming languages, strings are a data type. Strings are typically stored at distinct memory addresses (locations). Thus, the same string (e.g., the empty string) may be stored in two or more places in memory. 

In this way, there could be multiple empty strings in memory, in contrast with the formal theory definition, for which there is only one possible empty string. However, a string comparison function would indicate that all of these empty strings are equal to each other.

Even a string of length zero can require memory to store it, depending on the format being used. In most programming languages, the empty string is distinct from a null reference (or null pointer) because a null reference points to no string at all, not even the empty string.

The empty string is a legitimate string, upon which most string operations should work. Some languages treat some or all of the following in similar ways: empty strings, null references, the integer 0, the floating point number 0, the Boolean value false, the ASCII character NUL, or other such values.

The empty string is usually represented similarly to other strings. In implementations with string terminating character (null-terminated strings or plain text lines), the empty string is indicated by the immediate use of this terminating character.

Different functions, methods, macros, or idioms exist for checking if a string is empty in different languages.

=== Representations of the empty string ===

The empty string is a syntactically valid representation of zero in positional notation (in any base), which does not contain leading zeros. Since the empty string does not have a standard visual representation outside of formal language theory, the number zero is traditionally represented by a single decimal digit 0 instead.

Zero-filled memory area, interpreted as a null-terminated string, is an empty string.

Empty lines of text show the empty string. This can occur from two consecutive EOLs, as often occur in text files. This is sometimes used in text processing to separate paragraphs, e.g. in MediaWiki.

<text>Claude Lionel Harrison (September 20, 1886 – March 12, 1986) became the 44th mayor of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, after serving as the city&#x27;s prosecutor for forty years.

The son of judge Eli Harrison and Eunice Mary Louisa Seabrook, he was born in Victoria. He was 64 years old when he was elected as mayor, serving from 1951 until 1955.

In 1953, during Harrison&#x27;s term as mayor, the Harrison Yacht Pond was built for use by model boats.

After John Maitland Marshall, a librarian suspected of leftist leanings, was fired in 1954, Harrison stated that he would support the burning of any subversive books found on library shelves.

Harrison died in Victoria at the age of 99.

<text>Lingo is an American television game show with multiple international adaptations. Contestants compete to decode five-letter words given the first letter, similarly to Jotto. In most versions of the show, successfully guessing a word also allows contestants to draw numbers to fill in a Bingo card.

Four &quot;Lingo&quot; series have aired in the United States. The first was aired in daily syndication from September 28, 1987, until March 25, 1988, and taped at the BCTV studios in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia; initially hosted by Michael Reagan, series creator Ralph Andrews took over beginning in February 1988. On August 5, 2002, Game Show Network (GSN) premiered a revival of &quot;Lingo&quot;, which was hosted by Chuck Woolery and ran for six seasons through 2007. On June 6, 2011, GSN premiered a second revival hosted by comedian Bill Engvall, running for one season.

On February 11, 2022, CBS announced that it had ordered a primetime revival of &quot;Lingo&quot;, with RuPaul as host and executive producer, which premiered on January 11, 2023.

==Gameplay==
===1987 version===

Two teams of two contestants, one of them usually a returning champion, compete. To start the game, each team receives a randomly generated &quot;Lingo&quot; card, similar in manner to a bingo card. Seven spaces are filled in, with one team playing with odd numbers and the other with even numbers.

The team is then given the first letter of a five-letter mystery word and must make attempts at guessing the word by spelling it out. To assist in figuring out the word, each letter lights up. A letter that turns red is in the mystery word and in the right place, one that is yellow is in the mystery word but in the wrong place, and one that does not light up is not in the mystery word at all. If the team did not come up with the right word on the first try, they were shown which letters were correctly placed as well as those in the word but not correctly placed. A team has five turns in which to guess the word.

Control passes to the opposing team if the team in control either fails to guess before five seconds expire; makes an invalid guess (a misspelled word, a proper noun, a contraction, a hyphenate, or a word not five letters in length), or guesses incorrectly on the fifth turn. Passing control to the opposing team also reveals another letter in the word, unless doing so would fill in the word completely. If the opposing team still fails to guess, then the word is discarded and a new one is generated.

After correctly guessing a word, the team that did so got a chance to draw two balls from inside their hopper, with each teammate drawing one. Each hopper contained balls that had the uncovered positions on the Lingo board printed on them, as well as three gold balls and three red balls. The gold balls awarded prizes to the team if they were drawn, and the team had to win the game to claim them. The red balls, if drawn, caused the team to lose control.

Play continued until one of the teams made a Lingo (five numbers consecutively aligned either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), with that team winning the game and $250 plus whatever prizes they had earned with the gold Lingo balls (if any). Later on in the run, the cash prize awarded was based on the type of Lingo that was made. A horizontal or vertical Lingo paid $500, a diagonal Lingo $1,000, and a “Double Lingo”, which happened when one Lingo ball completed two lines, was worth $2,000. The gold prize balls were eventually done away with as well.

=== 2002 version ===
Gameplay on the GSN version was largely similar to that of its 1987 counterpart, though with several changes.

To start each game, ten random numbers on each team’s Lingo card were covered; unlike the original series, the board did not use the letters in &quot;Lingo&quot; for positioning. The first team to correctly guess a word was awarded 25 points and the opportunity to draw two balls. Inside the hoppers were numbered balls corresponding with the numbers on the Lingo card as well as the red balls, which host Chuck Woolery referred to as &quot;stoppers&quot; in a nod to his former game show &quot;Scrabble&quot;. Completing a Lingo was worth 50 points, and once a team completed a Lingo they received a new card with ten numbers covered.

In the second round, the point values were doubled (each correct word was worth 50 points, while a Lingo was worth 100 points), and three balls with question marks on them were placed in the hoppers, which could be used to cover any number on a team&#x27;s card when drawn. The team with the most points at the end of this round won the game and moved on to play Bonus Lingo.

In the event of a tie, a seven-letter word would be displayed and the letters filled in one at a time, with all four contestants able to buzz in. The first one to guess the word won the game for his/her team.

===Bonus round===
====No Lingo (1987 version)====

The bonus round of the 1987 version had the exact opposite objective of the front game, with the champion team trying to &quot;avoid&quot; making a Lingo.

To start the game, the team was shown a Lingo board with even numbers on it. Sixteen of the twenty-five numbers were covered to start, and the team was staked with $500. They were then shown a word, with the first letter and one of the other four displayed. As in the main game, they had five chances to guess the word. For each chance it took, the team would have to draw one Lingo ball from the hopper. If the team did not guess the word after five chances, the correct word was revealed and two additional Lingo balls (a total of seven) would need to be drawn.

This time the hopper contained balls with every even-numbered Lingo space on them, regardless of whether they appeared on the board or not, and one gold ball. For each draw, the host would call out the letter and number on the ball, and as long as the ball did not have a number on it that would complete a Lingo, play continued. If none of the drawn balls completed a Lingo, or if they drew the gold ball from the hopper at any time, their winnings doubled.

The round was played until a Lingo was made or the team survived five words without making one. Before each word, the team was given a chance to stop with their winnings or continue playing, as making a Lingo would end the game and the team would lose any money earned to that point. If they managed to survive five draws without a Lingo, their total cash prize would be $16,000. Champions initially competed for up to three days, and for each return trip to the No Lingo round their starting stake was doubled; a maximum payout of $32,000 would be available for a second trip and $64,000 for a third trip.

Coinciding with the change in scoring in the front game, the bonus round rules were adjusted. The cash prize awarded in the front game became the starting stake for the No Lingo round, and champions were allowed to stay on for a maximum of four matches or until they lost the bonus round twice.

====Bonus Lingo (2002 version)====

In the 2002 version, the winning team had two minutes to guess as many five-letter mystery words as possible. Two letters were initially revealed in each word, one of which was always the first letter. If the team failed to guess a word in five tries, it was revealed and the team moved on to the next word. The team won $100 for each correctly guessed word, up to $1,000 for ten words.

A Lingo card was then revealed with thirteen numbers marked off. The hopper contained twelve balls, one for each uncovered space on the board, and the team drew a ball for each mystery word successfully guessed in the first half of Bonus Lingo. Forming a Lingo won the team a $4,000 prize package consisting of an Argus digital camera, a Borders gift card, a Croton watch, and a Cassiopeia EM-500 Pocket PC plus the money earned in the first half of Bonus Lingo.

From season two onward, the team was also given &quot;bonus letters&quot;: one for winning the main game, and an additional one for each Lingo they had scored. The team could elect to use a bonus letter at any time to fill in the first unrevealed letter in a word, even if doing so would reveal the word. In addition, the layout of the Bonus Lingo card was changed so that twelve numbers were marked off and a Lingo could be achieved in only one draw. Doing so awarded a large prize: a trip plus $5,000 cash in seasons two and three, $10,000 cash in season four, and a jackpot that began at $10,000 and increased by $1,000 per day it went unclaimed in seasons five and six. Throughout the series&#x27; run, the team won $5,000 for achieving a Lingo in two or more draws, or $100 per correctly guessed word if they failed to do so. Unlike the 1987 version, this version did not feature returning champions.

====Tournaments and special episodes====
GSN held a tournament of champions with particularly successful contestants from its second and third seasons. Instead of playing Bonus Lingo in the final tournament episode, a third round was played in which points tripled, meaning teams earned 75 points for a completed word and 150 points for a Lingo. The question mark balls from the second round carried over to the third round. At the end of the show, the team with the most points won a Suzuki Verona for each teammate.

A special episode that aired on April Fool&#x27;s Day in 2003 had the entire roster of GSN&#x27;s six original show hosts together playing for charity. While Woolery hosted, Mark L. Walberg (&quot;Russian Roulette&quot;) and Marc Summers (&quot;WinTuition&quot;) played against Kennedy (&quot;Friend or Foe?&quot;) and Graham Elwood (&quot;Cram&quot;), with Walberg and Summers shutting them out 500–0. The sixth host, Todd Newton (&quot;Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck&quot;), served as the show&#x27;s announcer.

===2011 version===

Each team begins the game with nine numbers marked off on their own board. At the start of the show, a member of each team draws a Lingo ball, and the team with the higher number gets to play first. Unlike in previous versions, the number balls are on a rack and not in a hopper. If the ball is a number ball, it is also marked off as the tenth number on the team&#x27;s board. If the ball is a stopper or a prize ball, no number is marked off. Also unlike the previous versions, the host gives a clue as to the word&#x27;s meaning.

Correctly identifying words in round one earns $100, $200 in round two, and $500 in round three. Completing a five-number Lingo awards the same payouts as correct words in each round. When a new board is issued to a team, nine numbers are pre-marked. Three words each are played in rounds one and three, while four words are played in round two. The team with the most money after round three wins the game, keeps the money, and plays Bonus Lingo. If a team is mathematically unable to catch up, the game ends once the balls have been drawn for the last word.

In Bonus Lingo, the winning team has 90 seconds to correctly guess five words, receiving two letters in each word. The team wins the identical amount earned in the main game for the first correct word and that amount is then doubled for each additional correct word until the fifth one, which earns the team $100,000. The amount earned in Bonus Lingo is added to the team&#x27;s total winnings.

=== 2023 version ===
The 2023 revival does not use any bingo mechanics and consists only of word guessing. Each episode features two semi-final matches between two teams each (starting in season 2, the first game has a defending championship team defending their title), consisting of the following rounds:

* In the first round, each team plays three five-letter words. Guessing a word correctly on the first try (called a &quot;Golden Guess&quot;) earns $5,000, with subsequent guesses worth $2,500, $2,000, $1,500, and $1,000, respectively. An invalid guess gives the opposing team a chance to steal. If the opposing team gives an invalid guess, play on that word ends.
* In the second round, &quot;Super Lingo,&quot; each team is given a clue about a ten-letter mystery word whose letters are revealed over time: each word is worth up to $5,000, with its value decreasing as more letters are revealed. Before they play their word, each team chooses from one of two hoppers of &quot;Lucky Balls,&quot; from which a ball is drawn: gold &quot;money balls&quot; add a cash bonus (either $100, $500, or $1,000) on top of the value of the word if solved, while white &quot;letter balls,&quot; numbered between 1 and 10, reveal the corresponding letter in the word before the money starts decreasing. In season two, each team is given an additional eleven-letter mystery word to solve. If the team in control fails to solve the mystery word, the other team has a chance to steal the money.
* In the third round, the &quot;Lingo Battle,&quot; the two members of each team are assigned to five-letter and six-letter words respectively, with all values from round one doubled. Each word is allowed a maximum of five guesses. If a contestant&#x27;s guess for a word does not reveal a new correctly placed (green) letter or is invalid, control of the word passes to the opposing player. After the conclusion of this round, a twelve-letter Super Lingo word is played between both teams, which starts at $10,000 ($15,000 in season two). The team that has the most money wins the match and moves on to the Lingo Showdown.
* In the event of a tie game, one more Super Lingo word is played as a tiebreaker to determine the winner of the match.

The two winning teams advance to &quot;Lingo Showdown&quot; to compete for the episode&#x27;s jackpot, which consists of $50,000 and the total scores of both teams in the main game. Each team attempts to solve as many words as they can in two minutes. In season one, words alternated between five-letter words worth 5 points each and six-letter words worth 10 points each; in season two, all words are five letters and score 1 point. The team who won more money in their match decides who goes first. Teams can pass on words as often as needed. If the team gives an invalid guess on a word, the word in play is removed, and a new word is played. The team that scores more points wins the jackpot. If the Lingo Showdown ends in a tie, one more 12-letter Super Lingo word is played to break the tie. In season two, teams who win the Lingo Showdown are invited to appear on the next show as returning champions.

==Broadcast history==
The first version premiered on September 28, 1987, with Michael Reagan, adopted son of then U.S. President Ronald Reagan, as host and Dusty Martell as co-host. Beginning on February 22, 1988, executive producer Ralph Andrews took over as host and Margaux MacKenzie replaced Martell as co-host. New episodes aired until March 25, 1988, with repeats airing until September of that year. The show was produced by Ralph Andrews Productions (in association with Bernstein/Hovis Productions) in Canada for syndication by ABR Entertainment in the United States.

On August 5, 2002, Game Show Network revived the program with Chuck Woolery as host. In season three, a co-host was added to reveal the puzzles and provide banter. Woolery&#x27;s co-host was Stacey Hayes in season three, while Hayes had Paula Cobb as another co-host for the first two episodes of the season. Hayes was later replaced by Shandi Finnessey for the remainder of the series. Randy Thomas, known for her work in Hooked on Phonics ads, was the offstage announcer in season two, with Hayes also acting as announcer in season three. For the remainder of the series, the role of announcer was eliminated.

The first 20 episodes were recorded in the Netherlands on the set of the program&#x27;s Dutch counterpart; subsequent episodes were produced in the United States. Five more seasons, filmed in Los Angeles and each consisting of 65 episodes, began in December 2002, December 2003, August 2005, April 2006, and April 2007. GSN held back five unaired Hawaiian-themed episodes from season four, and these episodes later aired beginning January 1, 2007. The last episode of the Woolery version aired on June 29, 2007.

In 2011, GSN announced the show would restart production after a nearly four-year hiatus, with Bill Engvall as the new host. One season of forty episodes premiered on June 6, 2011. The last first-run show aired on August 1, 2011.

On February 11, 2022, CBS announced that it had ordered a primetime revival of &quot;Lingo&quot;, with RuPaul as host and executive producer; it was filmed at Dock10 in Salford, England (where the current British version is filmed) with American contestants. RuPaul also signed on to host a series of &quot;Celebrity Lingo&quot; episodes for broadcast in the UK. It premiered on January 11, 2023. On February 21, 2023, the series was renewed for a second season. The second season aired from May 24, 2024 until August 16, 2024.

===Episode status===
The rights to the 1987 version of the show are held by Ion Television. Ion included it in a February 2007 &quot;viewers vote&quot; on its website, with site visitors being able to vote for the show to be included in the network&#x27;s schedule. Despite this, Ion has not aired this or any other game show (except the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Family Feud&quot; episodes by special arrangement) since 2005. The 2002 and 2011 versions of &quot;Lingo&quot; remain owned by Game Show Network.

== International versions ==
== Merchandise ==
In late 2021, Two Way Media launched a mobile version of &quot;Lingo&quot; available for iOS and Android users. The game follows a similar format to the 2002–2007 version of &quot;Lingo&quot;. However, there are some slight differences. Players have a choice of playing a four-letter, five-letter, or six-letter round. If the player correctly guesses a word, they win coins and have the option to play bingo. This version of &quot;Lingo&quot; does not feature a bonus round.

<text>Bellerive is a suburb of the City of Clarence, part of the greater Hobart area, Tasmania, Australia. It stretches from Kangaroo Bay, bordering Rosny Park, along the shoreline of Bellerive Esplanade to Kangaroo Bluff, then to Bellerive Beach, and east to Second Bluff where Bellerive meets Howrah. To the north, Bellerive is bordered by the foothills of Waverly Flora Park.

==History==

Bellerive was first settled in the 1820s, originally known as &quot;Kangaroo Point&quot; due to the large number of kangaroos seen on the shore. Even before this time, a ferryman regularly crossed the Derwent River, coming ashore in the Bellerive area. After the first settlers arrived, the area expanded rapidly, with roads leading to the farming districts of Clarence Plains (Rokeby), Coal River (Richmond), and Hollow Tree (Cambridge).

By the 1830s, the name was changed to Bellerive (French for &quot;beautiful shore&quot;). The village became the hub of eastern shore contact with Hobart, with several boats crossing between Bellerive and Sullivans Cove every day.

Early businesses included farming and slaughterhouses. In 1834, there were four known inns: Clarence House, Golden Fleece Inn, Highlander, and the Plough.

The Clarence Hotel, built in 1879, has long been a local social hub and a waiting point for ferry passengers. The Bellerive Hotel existed between 1862–1865 and 1898–1901, according to licensing records.

One of the oldest surviving buildings in Bellerive is the Commandant&#x27;s Cottage. The original police station, built in 1842 from local sandstone, still retains much of its original structure. The building has served various purposes, including municipal council chambers, a district library, and the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) headquarters. Today, it is a community arts centre. The Bellerive Primary School, also built in 1842, continues to serve the local community.

St. Mark&#x27;s Chapel, an Anglican church built in 1851, stands on the site of the former 1826 &quot;Chapel of Ease.&quot;

The area around Bellerive Quay and the boardwalk maintains a village-like atmosphere, with many historical homes and buildings dating back to the early 19th century. The old Bellerive Post Office, built in 1897, now houses the Sound Preservation Museum and the Genealogical Society of Tasmania. At the point of Kangaroo Bluff stands the 19th-century British fortress known as Kangaroo Battery, built in 1885, now a public park.

From 2 May 1892 until 30 June 1926, the Bellerive-Sorell Railway had its terminus on a long jetty that extended into the bay, on what is now part of the boardwalk.

The former 300-seat Regent Theatre, opened on the corner of Percy Street and Cambridge Road on 5 November 1931, was both a cinema and town hall. It closed in the 1960s, reopening briefly as the Civic Cinema in 1975 before being demolished in the 1980s.

Bellerive is the eastern port of call for Hobart commuter ferries.

==Recent Developments==
In 2024, several projects were initiated in Bellerive, including developments at Kangaroo Bay and upgrades to Bellerive Wharf. These projects reflect ongoing changes in the suburb as it adapts to infrastructure needs and community planning.

===Kangaroo Bay development===
The Kangaroo Bay development has been a significant topic of discussion in Bellerive. The waterfront site has seen ongoing debate involving developers, the Clarence City Council, and local Indigenous groups.

In 2022, the Chinese company Chambroad proposed a luxury hotel for the site, aimed at creating a high-end development. However, the project encountered opposition from some Aboriginal groups, who raised concerns regarding its potential cultural and environmental impact. These groups expressed their objections to the proposed changes at Kangaroo Bay in 2023.

In March 2023, the Clarence City Council initiated a buy-back of portions of the Kangaroo Bay site to reconsider its future development. By 2024, the Tasmanian Government designated the hotel as a major project, accelerating the approval process. Later in 2024, the Tasmanian Government used artificial intelligence (AI) to assess job creation estimates for the project, aiming to confirm that employment targets would be met.

===Bellerive Wharf and Ferry Terminal===
In 2024, designs for a new ferry terminal at Bellerive Wharf were released as part of Hobart’s public transportation strategy. The terminal will include updated docking facilities and improved public spaces, with the goal of increasing ferry services and enhancing accessibility.

===Cricket Tasmania and Bellerive Oval===
In early 2024, Cricket Tasmania announced its decision to vacate Bellerive Oval, also known as Blundstone Arena, after using the venue for several decades for both international and domestic matches. The departure has raised questions about the future use of the stadium and its role in the local sporting landscape.
In 2024, Bellerive Oval was renamed &quot;Ninja Oval&quot; following a naming rights agreement with SharkNinja, a global home appliances brand.

===Real estate===
The suburb&#x27;s waterfront properties and historical homes have contributed to its popularity with buyers. Bellerive’s real estate market has experienced growth, with the median house price reaching approximately $1.07 million as of 2024.
One notable sale in 2024 was the historic property &quot;The Gables,&quot; an Edwardian-style mansion on the Bellerive waterfront.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census, Bellerive had a population of 4,945. The suburb has a population density of approximately 1,866 people per square kilometre, over a land area of 2.65 km².

The median weekly household income in Bellerive is $1,568, compared to the national median of $1,746. About 22.3% of households in Bellerive have a total weekly income below $650, while 15.2% of households earn more than $3,000 per week.

Homeownership is relatively high in Bellerive, with 34.8% of households owning their homes outright and 35.6% owning with a mortgage. Approximately 28.4% of households rent. 

Culturally, 84.6% of Bellerive residents were born in Australia, followed by 4.4% born in England, 1.0% in New Zealand, and smaller groups from China and India. 

91.2% of residents speak only English at home. The most common non-English languages spoken include Mandarin (0.7%), Italian (0.4%), and French (0.3%).

Regarding religion, 51.7% of people in Bellerive reported no religious affiliation. Of those who identified with a religion, 27.8% were Christian, with Anglicanism (12.1%) and Catholicism (11.7%) being the most common denominations. Other religions include Buddhism (1.2%), Hinduism (0.6%), and Islam (0.4%).

==Sport==
Bellerive is best known as the home of international cricket ground Bellerive Oval, now renamed Ninja Oval. The suburb is also a popular area for sailing, with the Bellerive Yacht Club (established in 1926) operating a marina at Bellerive Quay.

<doc id="835946" wikidata="Q622521" url="?curid=835946" title="NBA draft">
<text>The NBA draft is the National Basketball Association&#x27;s (NBA) annual event, dating back to 1947, in which the teams in the league can draft players who declare for the draft and that are eligible to join their organization. The current NBA consists of 30 teams, and all thirty teams have at least one draft pick throughout the two draft rounds. Historically, the vast majority of players drafted into the NBA are college basketball players.

It is now common for players to also be drafted from international professional leagues, the G-League Ignite team, and youth professional basketball leagues. College players who have finished their four-year college eligibility are automatically eligible for selection, while the underclassmen have to declare their eligibility and give up their remaining college eligibility. International players who are at least 22 years old are automatically eligible for selection, while the players younger than 22 have to declare their eligibility. Players who are not automatically eligible but have declared their eligibility are often called &quot;early-entrants&quot; or &quot;early-entry candidates&quot;.

The draft usually takes place near the end of June, during the NBA offseason. Since 1989, the draft has consisted of two rounds; this is much shorter than the entry drafts of the other major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, all of which run at least seven rounds. Sixty players are selected in each draft. No player may sign with the NBA until he has been eligible for at least one draft.

In the past, high school players were also eligible to be selected. However, starting in the 2006 draft, high school players were not eligible to enter the draft directly after graduating from high school. The eligibility rules for the draft now state that high school players will gain eligibility for draft selection one year after their high school graduation, and they must also be at least 19 years old as of the end of the calendar year of the draft.

Some players have chosen to use that year to play professionally overseas for example, such as Brandon Jennings (Italy), Emmanuel Mudiay (China), and Terrance Ferguson (Australia). Thon Maker was eligible for the 2016 draft despite not going to college because he chose to undertake a postgraduate year, so he was technically one year removed from graduation.

==Draft selection process==
Some players must be at least 19 years of age during the calendar year of the draft, and a player who completed basketball eligibility at an American high school must also be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. Restrictions exist on players signing with sports agents and on declaring for, then withdrawing from, drafts—although most of them are enforced by the NCAA rather than the NBA. There had been only 44 draftees from high school to college to play in the NBA throughout this process. Any players who are not an &quot;international player&quot; must be at least one year out of the graduation of his high school class in order for them to qualify for the upcoming draft. Not many high school players went directly to the NBA draft for almost 20 years after Darryl Dawkins in 1975 because of the exposure of the college games.

In the early years of the draft, teams would select players until they ran out of prospects. The 1960 and 1968 drafts went as long as 21 rounds. By 1974, it had stabilized to 10 rounds (except 1977, when the rounds were eight following the addition of four former ABA teams joining the NBA via the ABA-NBA merger), which held up until 1985, when the draft was shortened to seven rounds. By agreement with the National Basketball Players Association, the drafts from 1989 onward have been limited to two rounds, which gives undrafted players the chance to try out for any team.

From 1956 through 1965, teams could use a territorial pick in which they forfeited their first-round selection in order to choose a player from their immediate area. The player presumably had a strong local following to boost fan interest. With territorial picks eliminated in 1966, replaced by a coin flip for the rights to first overall pick, the 1966 draft is considered the first modern NBA draft.

From 2009 through 2015, the college underclassmen had until the day before the April signing period to withdraw their name from the draft and retain NCAA eligibility. Since 2016, players could enter the draft and participate in the NBA draft combine multiple times and retain NCAA eligibility by withdrawing from the draft within 10 days after the end of the mid-May NBA draft combine.

== Draft lottery ==

The NBA draft lottery is an annual event held by the NBA, where the teams who did not make the playoffs in the past year participate in a state-lottery style process in order to determine the order that the first several teams pick players in the draft. The lottery covered the first three picks until 2018, after which it was increased to the first four. The team with the worst record receives the best odds of receiving the first pick. The NBA introduced the lottery process in 1985. The league was attempting to counter accusations that certain teams were purposefully losing in order to gain a chance to participate in the annual coin flip, where the worst team in each division (each conference starting in 1971) flipped a coin to see who will receive the first pick in that year&#x27;s upcoming draft.

In the lottery system, the league uses &quot;a lottery-style ping-pong ball machine with 14 balls numbered 1–14, and 1,000 four-digit combinations are assigned to the 14 lottery teams.&quot; Until 2018, the worst team received 250 combinations, the second worst getting 199, the third worst team 156, and so on. The first three draft picks were determined. Starting in 2019, the three worst teams receive 140 combinations each, the fourth worst 125, and so on. Those three teams will have an equal chance of winning the top overall pick. After the first four picks are determined, the rest of the teams are ordered in reverse order based on their record in the previous season, like in the previous system.

The lottery is generally held in the third or fourth week of May. The NBA goes to great lengths in order to keep the selection process both fair and not tampered with in any way. &quot;The actual Lottery procedure will take place in a separate room just prior to the national broadcast on ESPN. Select media members, NBA officials and representatives of the participating teams and the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young will be in attendance for the drawing.&quot; Attendees are not allowed cell phone or any other electronic access until the number one pick is revealed on the television broadcast.

== Trades ==
The NBA allows teams to trade draft picks, with all of a team&#x27;s first and second round draft picks in the next 7 drafts being tradable.

Draft picks in the NBA can be unprotected or protected. With unprotected picks the team who receives the pick is guaranteed to have the pick no matter where it falls, whereas a protected pick allows the team who trades a pick to retain it if it falls within a current range (such as being a top-5 pick or a draft lottery pick) with them often agreeing to give the team who receives the pick an unprotected pick in the following year&#x27;s draft as compensation. As a result of this unprotected picks are generally considered more valuable than protected picks.

Another common draft pick trade is a pick swap. Under this trade the team who receives the pick is given the right to swap picks with the other team if they are higher or retain their pick if it turns out to be higher pick then the draft pick of the team who traded the pick.

Under current NBA rules a team must have at least one first round pick (which can either be their own pick or another team&#x27;s pick) in every other draft under the Stepien Rule.

==Globalization of the draft==
Collegiate players dominated the NBA draft for decades since its inception in 1950. From 1995 to 2005, NBA teams drafted a slew of just-graduated high school standouts like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Dwight Howard, Tracy McGrady and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire. To counteract this, the NBA implemented an age requirement in July 2005. This meant that high school seniors were no longer eligible for the NBA draft in 2006 and thereafter.

The league did allow draft eligibility for high school postgraduates, as long as they were at least one year removed from their high school graduation and were 19 years old by the time they entered the league. This option was exercised first in 2015 when Indian prospect Satnam Singh Bhamara was drafted in the second round and again in 2016 when South Sudanese–Australian prospect Thon Maker was drafted in the first round.

===Selecting foreign players===

Foreign players have made a large impact on how teams draft. Early on, foreigners were not part of the draft. The NBA&#x27;s appeal was limited to the United States and the league was not yet attempting to expand internationally. The first foreign player, in the sense of being a national of a country other than the U.S., to be chosen first overall in the draft was Bahamian Mychal Thompson in 1978. However, Thompson&#x27;s selection was not a true harbinger of the game&#x27;s globalization, as he had spent much of his childhood in Florida, and had played college basketball at Minnesota. One of the first foreign players selected in the draft to play in the NBA was Manute Bol out of the Sudan in 1983 in the 5th round by the San Diego Clippers. Bol&#x27;s selection was later deemed ineligible by the NBA. Two years later Bol was drafted again by the NBA this time out of Division II University of Bridgeport in 1985 as the 31st pick overall in the second round. Although Bol did not have a stellar career, he is known for being one of the tallest players ever to play the game at 7 feet and 7 inches. He holds the record for being the tallest player ever to hit a 3-point field goal. The following two years saw two players born outside the U.S. selected first overall—Nigerian Hakeem Olajuwon in 1984 (he would later gain U.S. citizenship) and Jamaica-born American Patrick Ewing in 1985.

By the late 1990s, the number of foreign-born players drafted had dramatically increased. Some commentators incorrectly designate the top pick in the 1997 NBA draft, Tim Duncan, as the third international player picked number 1 overall. But Duncan is from the United States Virgin Islands and, like all USVI natives, is a U.S. citizen by birth. He also had played U.S. college basketball at Wake Forest. Not counting Duncan, 11 international players were selected in the two rounds of the 1997 draft. Like top-pick Duncan, 5 of those 11 players (including the second and third overall picks) had played college basketball in the U.S. The 1998 draft saw another foreign player picked first overall, Nigerian Michael Olowokandi, but like Duncan he had played college basketball, in his case at Pacific. The foreign player drafted highest in 2001 was Pau Gasol, selected third overall by the Atlanta Hawks. In 2002, Yao Ming became the first foreign player without U.S. college experience to be selected number 1 overall. Not only was the first overall pick an international player that year, but five more picks in the first round alone were also from overseas. In total, the 2002 draft produced 17 international players, with only three of them (all second-round picks) having U.S. college experience.

===International players selected number 1 overall===
Four international players had gone first overall before 2002, although all had played college basketball in the U.S., and one of them was in fact a U.S. citizen by birth. It was not until 2002 that an international player without college experience went first overall—Yao Ming. His selection was not only a watershed moment for the NBA, but it also had a large impact in Yao&#x27;s homeland of China. Hannah Beech (2003) wrote &quot;Yao has single-handedly transformed his countrymen from nameless, faceless millions into mighty men who can jam with the very best&quot;. Yao has helped the NBA grow into a worldwide product. Beech (2003) goes on to write &quot;Ratings for NBA games broadcast on Chinese TV have never been higher than this year as the nation keeps track of its new favorite team, Yao&#x27;s Houston Rockets&quot;. For his career Yao averaged a solid 19.0 points per game, 9.2 rebounds per game, 1.89 blocks per game, and shot 82.6 percent from the free throw line. It had later gotten to a point where the last four drafts from 2013 to 2016 all held international prospects as No. 1 selections in their respective drafts before ending the run in 2017.

The 2002, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2023, and 2024 NBA drafts saw international players picked first overall. In 2005, the Milwaukee Bucks picked Andrew Bogut, from Australia by way of the University of Utah, No. 1. The next year, the Toronto Raptors drafted Andrea Bargnani from Italy, making him the second foreign player without U.S. college experience and the first European to be selected number 1 overall. In 2011, Australian born Kyrie Irving was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers after having played one year at Duke. In 2013, the Cleveland Cavaliers selected Anthony Bennett, who played at UNLV, first overall and making Bennett the first Canadian to be drafted at No. 1. In the 2014 NBA draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers, again picking No. 1, selected Canadian shooting guard/small forward Andrew Wiggins. During the 2015 NBA draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves selected U.S.-born center Karl-Anthony Towns, also born with Dominican Republic citizenship by way of his mother, as the first player from the latter country and therefore the first Latin American to become the No. 1 selection, teaming up with Andrew Wiggins in the process. During the 2016 NBA draft, the Philadelphia 76ers selected Australian forward Ben Simmons to be the No. 1 selection. In the 2018 NBA draft, the Phoenix Suns selected Bahamian center Deandre Ayton as their first ever No. 1 selection, with Ayton being the second Bahamian taken at No. 1 behind Mychal Thompson, and the third Caribbean-born player after Patrick Ewing and Thompson. In the 2023 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs selected Frenchman Victor Wembanyama with the No. 1 selection, making him the first French player to be drafted at No.1. It also made him the third foreign player without U.S. college experience and the second European to be selected number 1 overall. In the 2024 NBA draft, the Atlanta Hawks selected Frenchman Zaccharie Risacher with the No. 1 selection.

==Notable past NBA drafts==
Some of the most noted NBA draft years are 1984, 1996 and 2003. The 2003 NBA draft was noted for bringing several future superstars into the league, such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh. The draft of 1986 was also notable for the number of solid or outstanding players selected in later rounds, partly because of drug problems that claimed the life of second overall pick Len Bias and affected the careers of several other first-round picks.

On the other hand, the draft of 2000 has been regarded as the worst in NBA history, with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; calling its first round &quot;a horrible group of players&quot;. The 2013 draft has also been called underwhelming, although Victor Oladipo and Rudy Gobert eventually became All-Stars, and Giannis Antetokounmpo later became a two time NBA MVP.

==NBA draft on television==
The NBA draft has been televised since 1980, the same year the NFL and NHL televised (or publicized) theirs. USA Network broadcast the draft as part of its contract with the NBA until 1984; starting in 1985, TBS did so as part of its &quot;NBA on TBS&quot; package. From 1990 to 2002, TNT took over the draft as more NBA properties moved to the network (the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot;). When ESPN acquired the rights to the NBA from NBC in 2002, ESPN began broadcasting the draft (starting in 2003) with the &quot;NBA on ESPN&quot;, which it continues to do today. It was also televised on broadcast television for the first time on ABC in 2021. NBA TV has also produced its own coverage since coming under the purview of Turner Sports since 2008.

<text>The College of New Rochelle (CNR) was a private Catholic college with its main campus in New Rochelle, New York. It was founded as the College of St. Angela by Mother Irene Gill, OSU of the Ursuline Order as the first Catholic women&#x27;s college in New York in 1904. The name was changed to the College of New Rochelle in 1910. The college was composed of four schools and became co-educational in 2016. In early 2019, Mercy College and College of New Rochelle announced that College of New Rochelle would be absorbed into Mercy College before fall 2019, including College of New Rochelle&#x27;s students, faculty, programs, and some facilities, as well as transcripts, history, and legacy of CNR alumni. Mercy College became the repository of CNR documents.

On September 20, 2019, the college declared bankruptcy due to $80 million in liabilities. The entire campus was subsequently sold in an auction and purchased by New York Trustees of the Masonic Hall and Asylum Fund. The trustees are entrusted with the maintenance and protection of certain assets of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York including the Utica Masonic Care Community. The college site has been renamed to the Masonic Care Community of New Rochelle.

==Academics==
The College of New Rochelle was chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The School of Nursing and Healthcare Professions was accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.

The college offered undergraduate degrees including Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Management and Bachelor of Science in nursing. Graduate degrees offered by the college included Master of Arts, Master of Science, and Master of Science in education.

Of the faculty, 89% held doctoral degrees or the highest degree available in their field. The student-faculty ratio was 11:1.

Following a university model, the College of New Rochelle was composed of five separate schools: School of Arts and Sciences; School of Nursing and Healthcare Professions; School of Business; School of New Resources (for adult learners); and Graduate School.

==Campus==
The main campus was located in New Rochelle, a Westchester County, New York, city about north of Manhattan. In 1896, the college&#x27;s founder, Mother Irene Gill, OSU, traveled to New Rochelle to explore the possibility of establishing a seminary there for young women. During this trip, she came across Leland Castle, an 1850s gothic revival structure and former vacation home of wealthy New York hotelier Simeon Leland. The castle was purchased in 1897 and became the first structure of the college. It has since been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The castle was part of the campus quadrangle and housed the &quot;Castle Gallery&quot;.

The campus consisted of 20 main buildings, including a $28M athletic, recreational, and educational complex called the Wellness Center (completed in 2008), which featured an NCAA competition-sized swimming pool, basketball court, fitness center, indoor running track, yoga studio, roof garden and meditation garden, and volleyball court; it also had the Mooney Center with computer and photography labs, and TV production studio; the 200,000-volume Mother Irene Gill Memorial Library; the Student Campus Center; the Rogick Life Sciences Building with many laboratories; four residence halls; and the Learning Resource Center for Nursing.

== Athletics ==
CNR athletic teams were the Blue Angels. The college was a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), primarily competing in the Hudson Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (HVIAC) from 2004–05 to 2018–19.

CNR competed in 12 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer and swimming; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and volleyball.

On February 22, 2019, the college announced its intention to close at the end of summer 2019. The college had failed to pay federal payroll taxes and owed the IRS an estimated $20 million. Following that discovery, the college fired faculty and staff, resulting in a lawsuit from dismissed tenured faculty. A New York State judge ruled that the dismissals were improper. On March 28, 2019, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Keith Borge, the former controller of the college, with &quot;defrauding municipal securities investors by fraudulently concealing the college&#x27;s deteriorating finances&quot;. The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office also brought criminal charges against Borge, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was released in 2022. The SEC did not file charges against the college because it cooperated with the investigation.

Mercy College became the repository of CNR documents. On August 12, 2019, William Latimer, the 14th and final College of New Rochelle president, joined Mercy College as vice president of its New Rochelle and Bronx locations serving in that role until March 2022.

In September 2019, the college declared bankruptcy as it had $80 million in liabilities. The campus and related materials were sold at auction and purchased by The Lodge Society Temple of New Rochelle, an organization affiliated with the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York, for $32 million in a private real estate bankruptcy auction case.

<doc id="835983" wikidata="Q1200744" url="?curid=835983" title="Desire (Bob Dylan album)">
<text>Desire is the seventeenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on January 5, 1976, through Columbia Records. It is one of Dylan&#x27;s most collaborative efforts, featuring the same caravan of musicians as the acclaimed Rolling Thunder Revue tours the previous year (later documented on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 5&quot;). Many of the songs also featured backing vocals by Emmylou Harris and Ronee Blakley. Most of the album was co-written by Jacques Levy, and is composed of lengthy story-songs, two of which quickly generated controversy: the 11-minute-long &quot;Joey&quot;, which is seen as glorifying the violent gangster &quot;Crazy Joey&quot; Gallo, and &quot;Hurricane&quot;, the opening track that tells a passionate account of the murder case against boxer Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, who the song asserts was framed. Carter was released in 1985, after a judge overturned his conviction on appeal.

A well-received follow-up to &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, &quot;Desire&quot; reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart for five weeks, becoming one of Dylan&#x27;s best-selling studio albums, and was certified double Platinum; the album reached in the UK. It claimed the slot on NME Album of the Year. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Desire&quot; on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was voted number 761 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Context==
&quot;Desire&quot; was released between the two legs of Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue tour. By 1975, Dylan had extensive experience playing with a number of bands, but these groups were assembled by others. In the case of the Hawks (later known as The Band), the group had performed for a number of years before ever meeting Dylan.

Dylan&#x27;s idea of forming his own band, who would later be known as the Rolling Thunder Revue, came when he saw Patti Smith and her group play at The Other End (previously, and after, named The Bitter End) on June 26, 1975. Smith had yet to record an album, but she was already attracting a lot of attention from the music press and industry. According to Clinton Heylin, these were her first shows with drummer Jay Dee Daugherty, the culmination of four years spent &quot;compiling a unique rock &amp; roll sound&quot;. According to Smith, Dylan was immediately struck by the chemistry between Smith and her band, and expressed a wish that he had chosen to stay with a single band.

Dylan would spend many nights over the next two weeks in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village and The Other End in particular, eventually meeting Rob Stoner and reacquainting himself with Bob Neuwirth. Stoner would later join his Rolling Thunder Revue, and Dylan would meet the remaining members through Neuwirth. According to Smith, he was thinking about improvisation and extending himself &quot;language-wise&quot;.

==Recording sessions==

Around the time of his first meetings with Smith and Stoner, Dylan began work on several new songs, finishing at least one song called &quot;Abandoned Love&quot;. Then, sometime in late June, while traveling in a car around the Village, Dylan spotted Scarlet Rivera walking with her violin in the case. Dylan stopped to converse with Rivera and invited her to his rehearsal studio where she spent the afternoon playing along with several of the new songs. Afterwards both attended a gig by Muddy Waters, during which Dylan was invited on stage and surprised Rivera by announcing her as his new violinist. &quot;If I had crossed the street seconds earlier,&quot; said Rivera in 2012, &quot;it never would have happened.&quot; According to Rivera, &quot;One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below)&quot;, &quot;Isis&quot; and &quot;Mozambique&quot; were all rehearsed with Dylan on guitar and Rivera accompanying on violin. As the rehearsals progressed, Dylan attempted some of the same songs on piano, experimenting with different keys in the process. Soon after, Dylan would ask Rivera to join him for his next album.

As early as mid-July, the concept of the Rolling Thunder Revue was beginning to solidify. According to Don DeVito, a representative for Columbia Records, the possibility of forming a band and touring the United States playing unannounced concerts was already being discussed at this point.

Meanwhile, Dylan&#x27;s songwriting partnership with Jacques Levy continued to grow. Jacques Levy was then best known for &quot;Chestnut Mare&quot;, a collaboration with Roger McGuinn that ultimately became one of The Byrds&#x27; last hits. Dylan had met Levy the previous spring, but they became reacquainted at The Other End.

One night, Dylan met Levy at his loft and showed him an early draft of &quot;Isis&quot;. According to Levy, &quot;Isis&quot; began life as a &quot;slow dirge&quot;, unlike anything he had ever heard before, which he felt gave the appearance of setting the listener up &quot;for a long story&quot;. When Dylan first played this embryonic version for him, the two of them started working together. According to Levy, it was an enjoyable song-writing partnership, with Levy writing words and Dylan contributing ideas. The session lasted until the early hours of the morning, after which Dylan and Levy traveled to The Other End. Dylan read the lyrics to the gathered crowd, to favorable reactions. The partnership went on to pen &quot;Hurricane&quot; and other tracks later featured on &quot;Desire&quot;.

Dylan finally held a recording session on July 14, recording two songs co-written with Levy: &quot;Joey&quot;, an epic ballad about gangster Joey Gallo, and &quot;Rita Mae&quot;, a short song about lesbian writer Rita Mae Brown. At this time, the Rolling Thunder Revue had not yet formed. The participating musicians instead consisted of the Dave Mason Band, Scarlet Rivera (the only future member of the Rolling Thunder Revue to participate in this session), and a number of other session players. Disappointed with the results, the session merely encouraged Dylan to form his own working band for his upcoming album.

Following the session, Dylan and Levy isolated themselves in the Hamptons to work on their songs. According to Levy, they finished off a total of fourteen songs over a three-week period. In total, an entire album&#x27;s worth of songs was written in less than four weeks of collaboration with Levy.

Two weeks after the first, failed session, Dylan returned to Studio E on July 28 with approximately 21 musicians at his disposal. By most accounts, the recording process was very haphazard. Dylan was determined to record the songs live, while producer Don DeVito&#x27;s inexperience led him to &#x27;stack&#x27; instruments on the multitrack tapes, making it virtually impossible to properly remix any of the songs or to overdub any off-key accompaniments.

Neil Hubbard, who was present at the session, felt that there were too many musicians present and the session lacked leadership. Guitarist Eric Clapton was present, just one of five guitarists in the studio. Clapton recalled later that Dylan appeared to be seeking an opportunity to work with new people he had met, although Clapton felt that Dylan was uncomfortable performing personal songs with such a large group present, and left the session after advising Dylan to use a smaller band, a sentiment later reiterated by Rob Stoner to producer Don DeVito.

Others at this session included Rob Stoner, Scarlet Rivera, Emmylou Harris, and the English pub rock band Kokomo. Many of them would later, and at the time, recount their frustrations regarding the recording process for &quot;Desire&quot; which was, in the opinions of the many professional musicians present, a rather chaotic process.

The following day, Dylan returned to Studio E with roughly half the number of musicians, retaining Stoner, Rivera, Harris, Hugh McCracken, and Vinnie Bell as well as saxophonist Mel Collins and percussionist Jody Linscott of Kokomo. This time, they managed a usable take of the song &quot;Oh, Sister&quot;, but the remainder of the session was deemed unacceptable.

On the night of July 30, 1975, Dylan returned to Studio E with a smaller group of musicians, including Stoner, Rivera, Harris, and drummer Howie Wyeth (a friend of Stoner&#x27;s who was hired by Dylan on Stoner&#x27;s suggestion). For the most part, this group of musicians formed the core of the Rolling Thunder Revue. The difference became apparent early on in the session, when a usable take of &quot;Isis&quot; was recorded on the first try. Both Dylan and Stoner were pleased with the session, and Stoner suggests that the more intimate sound was much closer to the sound of the completed album.

Five of the nine songs from &quot;Desire&quot; were recorded at that session, as well as a slow version of &quot;Isis&quot;, the original master take of &quot;Hurricane&quot;, the single-only release &quot;Rita Mae&quot;, and a successful take of &quot;Golden Loom&quot; that was later released in 1991. Of the participating musicians, only Emmylou Harris was dissatisfied with the results. It would also be her last session, as she had prior commitments with her own career.

The following night, Dylan held another session, this time recording three songs. From this session, Dylan recorded the master take for &quot;Isis&quot; as well as master takes for &quot;Abandoned Love&quot; and &quot;Sara&quot;. Dylan&#x27;s wife Sara, the subject of the song that bore her name, also accompanied him to this session.

===Outtakes===
The &quot;Desire&quot; sessions yielded a number of outtakes, but only one of these outtakes received any serious consideration. Written from the point of view of someone &quot;despairing, isolated, [and] lost&quot;, &quot;Abandoned Love&quot; debuted as an impromptu performance at the Other End on July 3, 1975. Clinton Heylin wrote that the song suggested Dylan&#x27;s self-confidence as an artist had returned, but that he still faced problems in his marriage. Originally intended for the album, it was ultimately replaced by &quot;Joey&quot;. &quot;Abandoned Love&quot; would not see official release until 1985 when a finished take was issued on the boxed-set retrospective, &quot;Biograph&quot;. Its first and only live performance at the Other End circulates as a highly prized recording among collectors.

Another song, &quot;Rita May&quot; (sometimes spelled as &quot;Rita Mae&quot;), was issued on a single-only release. It is an up tempo song, that some listeners believe to be a tribute to lesbian writer Rita Mae Brown. It was later covered by Jerry Lee Lewis on his self-titled album, issued in 1979.

Two other recordings were later released upon other albums. &quot;Catfish&quot;, a tribute to future Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Hunter (better known as Catfish Hunter), and &quot;Golden Loom&quot; were officially released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961-1991&quot; in 1991.

==Songs==
===&quot;Hurricane&quot;===

The album opens with &quot;Hurricane&quot;, arguably the most popular song on &quot;Desire&quot;. It protests the conviction of former middleweight boxer Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter for a triple murder in 1966, arguing for his innocence. In 1976, Carter won a second trial, but was again convicted of the triple murder. Carter was eventually released in 1985 after United States District Court Judge Haddon Lee Sarokin (who declined to hear Dylan&#x27;s song when his family offered it to him) ruled that he had not received a fair trial and state prosecutors decided not to try Carter a third time.

Dylan had been inspired to write it after reading Carter&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Sixteenth Round&quot;, which Carter had sent to Dylan because of his prior commitment to the civil rights struggle.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, this track was re-recorded due to some potentially libelous lyrics, which Dylan re-wrote. For this more uptempo album version, the harmony part was sung by Ronee Blakley, leaving the earlier track with Emmylou Harris unreleased.

During the fall tour preceding &quot;Desire&quot;″s release, Dylan and the Rolling Thunder Revue played a benefit concert for Carter in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. The following year, they played another benefit at Houston, Texas&#x27;s Astrodome. Dylan met with Carter on December 5, 1975, and performed a concert in Clinton State Prison, in which Carter took to the stage, to address the press. Among those present were representatives of &quot;People Magazine&quot; who ran an article about Dylan and Carter on December 22 of the same year.

===&quot;Isis&quot;===

One of the most celebrated songs on &quot;Desire&quot; is the symbolic travelogue &quot;Isis&quot;. According to music critic Tim Riley, &quot;Isis&quot; tells the story of a young groom who marries his bride before he learns the value of loyalty. Riley wrote that the story told of a man who learns about the love of a woman through the deception of another man and a &quot;quest for riches that resigned itself to the quest for human contact&quot;. Also, the protagonist mistakenly believes that his quest is for treasure when an ulterior purpose is at play. When he approaches the tomb, he finds it empty and without any reward. Unbeknownst to him, he was playing a part in a higher story line: the tomb eagerly awaited for the arrival of his companion who dies immediately. When he chucks the body into the empty space, he realizes what a folly this whole adventure has been, and decides to return to the arms of his knowing wife.

===&quot;Mozambique&quot;===

&quot;Mozambique&quot; allegedly started as a game, to see how many rhymes for &quot;-ique&quot; Dylan and Levy could find.

===&quot;One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below)&quot;===

&quot;One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below)&quot; tells the tale of a girl whose family are drifters, and of the man who must leave her to enter the &quot;valley below&quot;. The narrator describes a character who is beautiful: &quot;your eyes are like two jewels in the sky&quot; but for whom the narrator&#x27;s love and admiration are not reciprocated (&quot;but I don&#x27;t sense affection no gratitude or love, your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above&quot;). Dylan claimed to have composed the song while visiting the Roma festival in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, a French town in the Rhone river delta, in 1975 on his 34th birthday.

The song is a duet between Dylan and Emmylou Harris; as an incidental to its use of the harmonic minor scale and Dylan&#x27;s melismatic singing style, it has a Spanish gypsy flavor in the vocal melody. It was performed several times in live concerts in November 1978. The song was used in the 1998 Larry Clark film &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;. It was covered by The White Stripes on their 1999 debut album. Robert Plant covered the song in his 2002 album &quot;Dreamland&quot;. In 2003, the Sertab Erener cover of the song appeared on the soundtrack of the movie Masked and Anonymous. There is also a version by Roger McGuinn and Calexico for the 2007 film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;. 80&#x27;s punk singer Nina Hagen released a version with German lyrics on her 2011 album &quot;Volksbeat&quot;. Tom Jones covered the song for his 2021 covers album &quot;Surrounded by Time&quot;.

===&quot;Oh, Sister&quot;===
&quot;Oh, Sister&quot; became a concert favorite during the fall tour preceding &quot;Desire&quot;″s release. A poignant call for reunion, against the oblivion of time. Emmylou Harris&#x27; vocal on the final mix was actually overdubbed a day later, one of the few overdubs made during the &quot;Desire&quot; sessions.

===&quot;Joey&quot;===

The longest song of the album is &quot;Joey&quot;. A twelve-verse ballad, it describes the life of deceased gangster Joey Gallo and created a substantial amount of controversy when &quot;Desire&quot; was released. Dylan presents Gallo as an outlaw with morals, in the tradition of songs like Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot;. Dylan&#x27;s Gallo refused to kill innocent people, made peace with black men, and shielded his family when he was about to be shot as they were eating in a restaurant. Many commentators, notably rock critic Lester Bangs, have argued, however, that Gallo was well known as a vicious Mafioso whose documented career was not accurately reflected in the song&#x27;s lyrics.

The song details the killing of Gallo in Umberto&#x27;s Clam House in Little Italy, Manhattan, on April 7, 1972. Graphic details of the murder had been published in Donald Goddard&#x27;s book &quot;Joey: A Biography&quot; (Harper &amp; Row, 1974), while Gallo&#x27;s friends, actor Jerry Orbach and his wife Marta, were introduced to Dylan through Levy. Dylan said in 1975 that he had considered Gallo more a hero than a gangster. After hearing Jerry and Marta Orbach talk about Gallo, Dylan and Levy wrote the entire song in one night.

Unlike legendary outlaws like Robin Hood, or historical ones like Jesse James and Billy the Kid, Gallo was not a figure of the distant past nor was he mythologized by tall tales spread by word-of-mouth and the local press. With Gallo&#x27;s life still prominent in the minds of the public and without favorable media coverage, Dylan&#x27;s attempt to romanticize Gallo was greeted with an enormous amount of contempt by the press, public officials, and private citizens alike.

Goddard&#x27;s biography depicted Gallo as a racist who often beat his wife and abused his children, and who had taken part in a brutal gang rape of a young boy while he was in prison. None of these details was mentioned or alluded to in Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Joey&quot;. Instead, the song paints a far more romantic portrait, incorporating a lyric that Gallo &quot;It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun/&#x27;I&#x27;m around too many children,&#x27; he&#x27;d say, &#x27;they should never know of one.&#x27;&quot;

Lester Bangs later wrote a scathing response to a question posed by Dylan in the song&#x27;s chorus: &quot;What made them want to come and blow you away?&quot;. In a &quot;Village Voice&quot; article published on March 7, 1976, Bangs argued that some could have considered there to have been an open contract on Gallo for his shooting of gangster Joe Colombo almost a year previously. Bangs also suggested that two other theories advanced by investigators extremely close to the case showed Gallo attempting to lay claim to territory occupied by other, more powerful mob factions. Despite all the controversy, Clinton Heylin noted that &quot;Joey&quot; remained the one song from &quot;Desire&quot; to have regularly featured in concert in the nineties.

In an interview with Bill Flanagan for his album &quot;Together Through Life&quot; in 2009, Dylan said that Jacques Levy wrote the lyrics to &quot;Joey&quot; and that he only sang them.

===&quot;Romance in Durango&quot;===

&quot;Romance in Durango&quot; concerns an outlaw and his lover, on the run in Mexico. Heylin described the song as &quot;the climax to an unmade Sam Peckinpah movie in song&quot;, an allusion to the 1973 Peckinpah film &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;, for which Dylan wrote and performed the score and which was filmed in Durango.

This song has been covered in Italian by singer-songwriter Fabrizio De André as &quot;Avventura a Durango&quot; (using Neapolitan to stand in for the Spanish lyrics in the original song), in Portuguese by Raimundo Fagner as &quot;Romance no Deserto&quot;, and in Polish by &quot;Dylan.pl&quot; project with Maria Sadowska, entitled &quot;Romans w Durango&quot;.

===&quot;Black Diamond Bay&quot;===
As described by Heylin, &quot;Black Diamond Bay&quot; describes the destruction of a tiny island (following the eruption of a volcano), observed from two perspectives: from a hotel on the island itself and from the narrator&#x27;s point of view through a television news report. The song essentially describes what the people on the island are doing at the time - often drawing attention to the ironic futility of their actions (for example, one of the islanders is preparing to commit suicide when the volcano erupts and destroys the island). The song also describes the news-watcher&#x27;s indifference to the catastrophes he hears about on Walter Cronkite&#x27;s TV newscast, as the narrator goes to get another beer rather than watch the news story about the catastrophe on the island. He says &quot;I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.&quot; Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Victory&quot; was a major influence on this song, which references many of its themes; the song title, the island, the volcano, the gambling and the Panama hat are all references to &quot;Victory&quot;. A drawing of Conrad appeared on the back of the album sleeve.

===&quot;Sara&quot;===

&quot;Desire&quot; closes with &quot;Sara&quot;, arguably Dylan&#x27;s most public display of his own personal life. An ambitious tribute to his wife, Sara, it is one of Dylan&#x27;s only songs in which he steps out of his public persona and directly addresses a real person, with striking biographical accuracy. Tim Riley wrote that it was &quot;a fevered cry of loss posing as sincere devotion&quot;.

Dylan&#x27;s marriage was in a turbulent state when he wrote the song. Dylan&#x27;s estrangement from his wife had led to at least one separation in the previous year. Sara was present at the song&#x27;s recording session on July 31, 1975; on the same day he recorded two other songs that touched on the subject of marriage: &quot;Isis&quot; and &quot;Abandoned Love&quot;. However, in March 1977, Sara Dylan filed for divorce.

In the lyrics of &quot;Sara&quot;, Dylan states that he wrote &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot; (from &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;) for Sara Dylan.

==Aftermath==

&quot;Desire&quot; would not be released until early the following year. In the meantime, Dylan embarked on the first leg of a North American tour with the Rolling Thunder Revue. During the course of the tour, which received heavy media coverage, Dylan and his band unveiled songs from &quot;Desire&quot; in addition to reinterpreting past works. The Rolling Thunder Revue was also augmented by guest musicians such as Mick Ronson (best known for his work with David Bowie) and other artists such as Roger McGuinn, Joni Mitchell, and Joan Baez who not only contributed during Dylan&#x27;s set, but also played mini-sets of their own. Bruce Springsteen was invited to perform, but declined when Dylan informed him that he could not use the E Street Band to back him.

The fall of 1975 would ultimately produce a widely criticized film, &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot;, but the concerts themselves were well received. Often regarded as one of Dylan&#x27;s finest series of shows, this first leg of the tour was eventually documented on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue&quot;.

==Critical reception==
On January 5, 1976, &quot;Desire&quot; was released, garnering a fair share of critical acclaim. Critic Dave Marsh would call it one of the &quot;two best records Dylan has made since &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;&quot; and gave it a four-star review in the 1979 &quot;Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot;. He also mentioned that this album has shown a change in style compared to his other works in 1970s by saying: &quot;But love songs aren&#x27;t the focus of Desire, which is one of the things that differentiates it from Dylan&#x27;s other post-rock work. On the best songs, Dylan returns to the fantastic images, weird characters and absurdist landscapes of the Sixties.&quot; Some critics were not impressed; Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Although the candid propaganda and wily musicality of &quot;Hurricane&quot; delighted me for a long time, the deceitful bathos of its companion piece &quot;Joey&quot; tempts me to question the unsullied innocence of Rubin Carter himself&quot;. He disputed their categorization as protest songs and mused that Dylan&#x27;s songs about oppressed &quot;heroes&quot; may have been a reflection of Dylan&#x27;s own feelings at the time. 
Nevertheless, there was enough critical support to push &quot;Desire&quot; to number 26 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1976. In 2003, the album was ranked number 174 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.

The album also received a fair share of commercial success, eventually topping the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

<doc id="835994" wikidata="Q7369093" url="?curid=835994" title="Rosny, Tasmania">
<text>Rosny is a suburb of the City of Clarence, part of the greater Hobart area, Tasmania, Australia. It is located on the eastern shore of the Derwent River, between the suburbs of Montagu Bay and Rosny Park, approximately 4 kilometres from Hobart&#x27;s centre. Rosny is the residential part of its commercial namesake Rosny Park.

Rosny is a scenic, quiet residential area, with sweeping views of the Derwent River and its estuary, the Tasman Bridge and Mount Wellington, and looks directly across the river to the CBD of Hobart. It is located on a narrow peninsula which juts out from the eastern shore at Rosny Point and climbs the rising slopes of Rosny Hill.

==History==
Rosny was named for a family name of W.A. Bethune, the holder of the original grant on the point, and he named it after his ancestor, the Duc de Maximilien de Bethune Sully, of Rosny-sur-Seine near Mantes in France.

===Rosny Children&#x27;s Choir===

Rosny was the founding home of the Australian Rosny Children&#x27;s Choir. The choir was established in 1967 by local music teacher Jennifer Filby, who initially had her students perform carols at an end-of-year recital. Following this success, she was invited to provide a children&#x27;s chorus for a production of &quot;The King and I&quot; at the Theatre Royal in Hobart, leading to the formal creation of the choir.

The choir quickly gained national and international recognition. In 1971, it became the first choir from the southern hemisphere to perform at the prestigious Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in Wales. As part of the Australian government&#x27;s inaugural cultural exchange with the People’s Republic of China, the choir made history in 1975 as the first Australian group to perform in China, with concerts in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and a stopover in British Hong Kong.

In addition to its international tours to Japan (1987) and across Australia, the choir performed widely within Tasmania. It frequently collaborated with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and commissioned significant Australian works, including &quot;There is an Island&quot; (1977) by composer Don Kay with libretto by Clive Sansom. The choir’s reputation for excellence cemented its place as one of Australia&#x27;s leading children&#x27;s choirs during the late 20th century.

==Today==
In 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census, the suburb of Rosny had a population of 771 persons and 353 private dwellings.

Much of Rosny is given over to thick groves of local she-oaks, which line the foreshore, interspersed with radiating residential streets. The Rosny Point Reserve, owned by the Clarence City Council covers 7.8 hectares, but does not include the strip of land adjoining the river which is a Public Reserve under the Crown Land Act (6.7 hectares). Rosny Hill Nature Recreation Area (21.4 hectares), under the authority of the Parks and Wildlife Service but managed by the City of Clarence, occupies the hill top. Approximately 46 percent of the total land area of 76.6 hectares of Rosny is reserved land.

Rosny Hill Recreation Area itself is also covered in native vegetation and, although not particularly high at 94.25 metres at the Survey Control Site, its position jutting out into the river provides views from the lookout that skirts the top of the hill.

There are five vegetation communities within the Rosny Hill Nature Recreation Area: Grassy &quot;Eucalyptus viminalis&quot; woodland, Inland &quot;Acacia verticillata&quot; low fores, Lowland &quot;Themeda&quot; grassland, Lowland grassland complex and Bursaria-acacia woodland and scrub. There are several rare and threatened native plant species, including Leafy sun orchid (&quot;Thelymitra bracteata&quot;), Grassland flax lily (&quot;Dianella amoena&quot;), Spear grass (&quot;Austrostipa nodosa&quot;), Tall wallaby grass (&quot;Austrodanthonia induta&quot;), Shade peppercress (&quot;Ledidium pseudotasmanicum&quot;), and Narrow leaf New Holland daisy (&quot;Vittadinia muelleri&quot;).

==Services==
Housing Tasmania purchased in 2010 the Marantha Nursing Home, now called Bellview Manor, and it is used as Hostel Accommodation providing 32 bedrooms in a Hostel and 8 units.

Rosny&#x27;s main non-residential infrastructure is the Rosny Waste Water Treatment plant located off Bastick Street owned by Taswater. The plant was once notoriously created foul odours, but modernised techniques have removed this problem. Work commenced in 2004 to install effluent pumps, 6.7 kilometres of raising mains, large storage tank and over 1.8 kilometres of reticulation mains between the plant and the Coal Valley to allow 2.5 billion litres of treated effluent to be used for agricultural use. The works were completed in October 2006.

Located on the boundary between Rosny and Rosny Park area, there is Clarence RSLA and Rosny Park Bowls Club, Rosny Park Tennis Club, Rosny College and the Charles Hand Memorial Park. There are also two churches on the boundary between the Rosny and Montagu Bay suburbs, St James Anglican Church and Seventh Day Adventist Church. The latter church is also used by local Funerals Directors. The Clarence Aquatic Centre YMCA and Clarence Sports Centre are close by in adjoining suburb of Montagu Bay. The local store, also in Montagu Bay suburb has closed down.

==Transport==
Rosny is serviced by local Metro Tasmania bus route 676 with this service terminating at the Elizabeth Street Bus Mall in Hobart. On weekdays, Route 676 leave Rosny Bus Mall at 7:25 am, 8:12 am, and hourly from 9:31 am until 2:31 pm. Route 676 departs Elizabeth Street Bus Mall in Hobart at 3:24 pm, 4:24 pm and 5:24 pm. There is no weekend or public holiday service. 
Many residents drive or walk to the bus stop under the Rose Bay High School overpass, near the Clarence Pool, where buses on Metro routes (601, 615, 616, 624, 625, 634, 635, 646) can be hailed. These route operate as a high frequency service, every 10 minutes Monday to Friday, 7 am to 7 pm. These routes are part of &#x27;Turn Up and Go&#x27; network introduced 11 January 2016.

There are multi-use paths and cycleways along the shoreline of Rosny Point, linking the suburb with Rosny Park and the CBD of Hobart. There is also a formed track around the top of Rosny Hill.

<text>Joseph Lewis Thomas (born July 5, 1973), known mononymously as Joe, is an American R&amp;B singer. He signed to Polygram Records in 1992, and rose to prominence after releasing his debut album &quot;Everything&quot; the following year. He followed it with a series of successful albums under Jive Records, including &quot;All That I Am&quot; (1997), the international bestseller &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot; (2000) as well as the multi-certified albums &quot;Better Days&quot; (2001) and &quot;And Then...&quot; (2003). Several songs from these albums became hit singles on the pop and R&amp;B record charts, including the number-one hit &quot;Stutter&quot;, the top-ten entries &quot;All the Things (Your Man Won&#x27;t Do)&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Player&quot;, and &quot;I Wanna Know&quot; as well as his collaborations &quot;Faded Pictures&quot; and &quot;Thank God I Found You&quot;, the latter of which he performed alongside Mariah Carey, also a number-one hit, and &quot;Still Not a Player&quot;.

Since his departure from Jive, Joe has released most of his projects independently through ventures with Kedar Massenburg and Plaid Takeover Entertainment. In 2016, his twelfth album &quot;My Name Is Joe Thomas&quot; became his eleventh album to score a top five-placing on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, while lead single &quot;So I Can Have You Back&quot; became his fourth number-one hit on the Adult R&amp;B Songs chart over the span of three consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s, and 2010s). In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed Joe at 48th on its list of the Top 50 R&amp;B and Hip Hop Artists of the past 25 years. An ASCAP Award recipient for his song &quot;I Wanna Know&quot;, Joe is a seven-time Grammy Award nominee and has been nominated for numerous other awards and accolades, including a BET Award, an NAACP Image Award, and four Soul Train Music Awards.

== Early life ==
Joe was born July 5, 1973, in Columbus, Georgia, and was the child of evangelist preachers. He moved to Opelika, Alabama during his formative years and graduated from Opelika High School in 1991.

== Career ==
=== 1990s ===
After his graduation from Opelika High School, Joe continued to sing and write music while working at occasional temporary jobs. In New Jersey, while working at a gospel record store and continuing his music education through a local church, he met producer Vincent Herbert and recorded a three-song demo tape. In 1992, he signed to PolyGram Records and released his debut album &quot;Everything&quot; the next year. Produced by Joe along with Keith Mille, J. Dibbs, and Dave &quot;Jam&quot; Hall, it peaked at number 105 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 16 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. &quot;Everything&quot; spawned three singles, including I&#x27;m in Luv&quot; and &quot;The One for Me&quot; the former of which became a top ten hit on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and peaked at number 22 on the UK Singles Chart. The following year, Joe appeared in the group Black Men United, along with then-label mate Brian McKnight, Gerald Levert, Aaron Hall, Tevin Campbell and other male singers for the single &quot;U Will Know&quot; for the soundtrack to the romantic drama film, &quot;Jason&#x27;s Lyric&quot;.

In 1996, Joe contributed the song &quot;All the Things (Your Man Won&#x27;t Do)&quot; to the soundtrack to the crime comedy parody film &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood&quot; (1996). Released as a single, it reached number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was later included as the opening track on his second studio album &quot;All That I Am&quot; (1997) after signing with Jive Records. Marking his commercial breakthrough, the album reached number 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Another hit single from the album &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Player&quot;, was also featured on the &quot;Booty Call&quot; soundtrack. &quot;All That I Am&quot; eventually went platinum in the US.

A songwriter and producer, Joe became a frequent collaborator on other artist&#x27;s projects in the mid-1990s. He remixed a duet by Barry White and Tina Turner called &quot;In Your Wildest Dreams&quot; as well as a remix of Turner&#x27;s single &quot;Something Beautiful Remains&quot; from Turner&#x27;s album &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; (1996) and wrote and produced on albums by R&amp;B groups Ideal, Xscape and Hi-Five. In addition, Joe sang on the remix of Big Punisher&#x27;s &quot;Still Not a Player&quot;, produced by Knobody, which interpolated his own song &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Player&quot; and appeared as a backing vocalist on Brandy&#x27;s track &quot;Angel in Disguise&quot; from her second album, &quot;Never Say Never&quot; (1998). In 1999, singer Mariah Carey asked him to sing on her track &quot;Thank God I Found You&quot; which appeared on her album &quot;Rainbow&quot; (1999). Released as the album&#x27;s second single, it became Joe&#x27;s first number-one single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Aside from its peak of number two in Canada, the song achieved moderate international charting, reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom and peaking within the top thirty in Australia, Belgium (Wallonia), France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

=== 2000–2007: Rise to success ===
In April 2000, Joe released his third album, &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot;. Produced by Joe and several other record producers such as Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs, Teddy Riley and Tim &amp; Bob, it received favorable reviews from critics and peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while topping the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It charted internationally as well, peaking within the top 10 in Netherlands and Canada. &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot; produced three singles, including &quot;I Wanna Know&quot;, &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot;, and &quot;Stutter&quot;, the first and last of which reached the top five of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The biggest seller of his discography, &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot; was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and earned platinum and silver certifications from Music Canada, Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique (SNEP), and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In 2001, the album and &quot;I Wanna Know&quot; received Grammy Award nominations in the Best R&amp;B Album and Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance categories.

The following year, &quot;Better Days&quot;, Joe&#x27;s fourth album, was released. Significantly less successful, it reached number 32 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; but peaked at number four on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, reaching gold status in the US. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Home Tonight&quot;, which reached number 18 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and the Adult R&amp;B Songs chart-topper &quot;What If a Woman&quot;. A critical success, &quot;Better Days&quot; became his second album to receive a Grammy nomination in the Best R&amp;B Album category, while &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Home Tonight&quot; was nominated for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. In 2002, Joe did another collaboration with Mariah Carey on the remix version of &quot;Through the Rain&quot;, the first single from her album &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; (2002).

Joe recruited a diverse roster of high-profile musicians to work with him on his fifth studio album, including Carvin &amp; Ivan, Dre &amp; Vidal, R. Kelly, and The Underdogs. Released in late 2003, &quot;And Then...&quot; reached number 26 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. While Kelly-penned lead single &quot;More &amp; More&quot; became a top 20 R&amp;B in the US, it was released on double A-side with &quot;Ride Wit U&quot;, a collaboration with rap group G-Unit, elsewhere. A moderate success, the single entered Australia&#x27;s top 40 in July 2004, and peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming one if his biggest hits there. A steady seller, &quot;And Then...&quot; was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Joe&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Like Me&quot;, released in April 2007, was produced by Stargate, Tank, Cool &amp; Dre, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Sean Garrett and featured guest appearances by rappers Nas, Fabolous, Papoose, Young Buck and Tony Yayo. It received generally positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and on top of the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart, selling about 98,000 copies in its first week, while marking his highest-charting album since &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot;. While lead single &quot;Where You At&quot; charted in the United Kingdom only, follow-up &quot;If I Was Your Man&quot; reached number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult R&amp;B Songs. &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Like Me&quot; marked Joe&#x27;s final album with Jive Records following a fallout with label surrounding rumors of his dissatisfaction with the promotion of his material. Also in 2007, Joe performed a cover version of &quot;Before He Cheats&quot;, a Carrie Underwood hit, as a Pepsi Smash exclusive on Yahoo! Music.

=== 2008–present: Independent releases ===
Following his departure from Jive Records, Joe released his seventh album &quot;Joe Thomas, New Man&quot; independently on record label executive Kedar Massenburg&#x27;s Kedar Entertainment company in September 2008. Production on the album was helmed by Bryan-Michael Cox, Stereotypes, and D&#x27;Mile among others. Upon release, it debuted at number eight on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 56,733 copies in its first week. Lead single &quot;E.R. (Emergency Room)&quot; became the only single to reach the top forty on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Only ten months later, &quot;Signature&quot;, his second album with Kedar, was released. An album composed of ballads written, produced, and arranged by Joe, it debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The same year, Joe released the holidays EP &quot;Make Sure You&#x27;re Home for Christmas&quot;, which was released exclusively through Target and features two original songs and four cover versions of Christmas standards and carols. A top twenty success on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, the standalone EP was worked into a full-length album, entitled &quot;Home Is the Essence of Christmas&quot;, released the following year.

In 2010, Joe collaborated with label mate Keith Sweat on the song &quot;Test Drive&quot;, written for Sweat&#x27;s album &quot;Ridin&#x27; Solo&quot;. Also in 2010, he released his ninth studio &quot;The Good, the Bad, the Sexy&quot;. The singer worked with Brandon &quot;B.A.M.&quot; Alexander, Gragston, The Ambassadorz, and Gerald Issac on most of the record which debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop albums chart. Following a short hiatus, Joe&#x27;s next effort, his tenth studio album &quot;&quot;, was released in July 2013, marking his first release on Massenburg&#x27;s newly formed company Massenburg Media after the dissolution of his Kedar Entertainment. It debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the R&amp;B/Hip Hop chart, selling 31,500 copies in its first week. The singer worked with a small group of musicians on the album, including San Francisco-based producer D.O.A., who contributed &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Have a Love&quot; and the duet &quot;Love &amp; Sex&quot;, featuring singer Fantasia. Rapper Too Short also appears on the album.

In March 2014, Joe signed a distribution deal with BMG Rights Management. His eleventh album, &quot;Bridges&quot;, marked his first album under Plaid Takeover Entertainment, a venture of regular co-executive producer Gerald Isaac, after severing business ties with Massenburg. After a decade of consecutive top ten entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it debuted and peaked at number 17, with first-week sales of 15,126 copies in the United States. The first single released from the album was &quot;Love &amp; Sex, Pt. 2&quot;, a duet with singer Kelly Rowland serving as sequel to his 2013 collaboration with Fantasia. It became a top five hit on the Adult R&amp;B Songs chart. In November 2015, Joe recorded and released a cover to the critically acclaimed song Hello by artist Adele, which received mostly positive reviews. Joe&#x27;s twelfth album, &quot;My Name Is Joe Thomas&quot;, an homage to his third effort &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot; (2000), was released on November 11, 2016. The album debuted at number two on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with 17,000 copies sold the first week, and spawned the single &quot;So I Can Have You Back&quot;, his fourth number-one hit on the Adult R&amp;B Songs chart. In support of the album, Joe co-headlined a European concert tour alongside Ashanti from February to March 2017.

<text>The University of Guadalajara () is a public research university located in Guadalajara, Mexico. It was originally established in 1586 and officially founded on 12 February 1791 as the Royal and Pontifical University of Guadalajara. Over the centuries, it has evolved into one of Mexico’s leading educational institutions.

The university operates multiple high schools, as well as undergraduate and graduate campuses, which are distributed throughout the state of Jalisco. It is widely regarded as the most significant university in the region. Based on its foundation date, it is the second-oldest university in Mexico, the seventeenth-oldest in North America, and the fourteenth-oldest in Latin America.

Since 1994, the University of Guadalajara has operated under a network model to organize its academic activities. This university network comprises 15 university centers, the Virtual University System, the High School Education System, and the university&#x27;s general administrative body. During the 2014–2015 academic year, the university had a total enrollment of 255,944 students, including 116,424 undergraduate and graduate students and 139,520 high school students.

== History ==
=== The Royal University of Guadalajara (1791–1821) ===

At the time of its foundation in 1586, the college began offering higher education in Guadalajara, making it the first institution in the region to grant academic degrees. The first recorded request to establish a university in Guadalajara was made in 1696 by Friar Felipe Galindo y Chávez, who petitioned King Charles II of Spain to expand the recently founded Royal Seminary of San José. This initiated a century-long process that ultimately led to the establishment of the University of Guadalajara. Chronologically, the university is the second-oldest in Mexico, the seventeenth-oldest in North America, and the fourteenth-oldest in Latin America.

The proposal by Friar Felipe Galindo y Chávez was reconsidered by lawyer Matías Ángel de la Mota Padilla, who, in 1750, successfully involved Guadalajara&#x27;s city hall in the project. However, the need for a university in Nueva Galicia became more pressing after the expulsion of the Jesuit Order from all Spanish territories in 1767. The Jesuits had managed the two most important colleges in the city: Santo Tomás College and San Juan Bautista College, leaving a significant gap in higher education.

On 12 December 1771, Friar Antonio Alcalde y Barriga arrived in Guadalajara as the new Bishop of Nueva Galicia. He became a key supporter of the university’s foundation. In 1775, he responded to an inquiry from King Charles III of Spain, who sought advice on the feasibility of establishing a university in Nueva Galicia. The bishop’s response was entirely favorable, and on 18 November 1791, King Charles IV of Spain issued a royal decree officially proclaiming the foundation of the Royal University of Guadalajara.

The royal decree arrived in Nueva Galicia on 26 March 1792, prompting local authorities to celebrate and swiftly renovate Santo Tomás College in preparation for the new university. As a result, the University of Guadalajara was officially founded on 3 November 1792. By mutual agreement between Friar Antonio Alcalde and the President of the Royal Audience, Jacobo de Ugarte y Loyola, José María Gómez y Villaseñor was appointed as the university’s first Rector. Academically, the university initially consisted of four faculties: Arts, Theology, Law, and Medicine.

=== The Confrontation between the University of Guadalajara and the Institute of Sciences of the State of Jalisco (1821–1861) ===

The university aligned itself with Agustín de Iturbide&#x27;s Plan of Iguala, which led to the conclusion of Mexican War of Independence. As a result, it retained its royal status. However, with the proclamation of the First Mexican Empire under Emperor Agustín I, its designation changed to imperial. When the Mexican Republic was later established, the university became a national institution.

On 16 January 1826, during the administration of José Cesáreo de la Rosa as Rector, the Jalisco State Congress issued its first formal decree concerning the University of Guadalajara. Subsequently, the Governor of Jalisco, Prisciliano Sánchez Padilla, reestablished the Institute of Sciences.

However, on 1 September 1834, Governor José Antonio Romero ordered the first reopening of the university and the closure of the Institute of Sciences. Despite this, thirteen years later, in 1847, the State Congress introduced the Public Teaching Program, which called for the closure of both the University of Guadalajara and San Juan Bautista College. The program also proposed the reestablishment of the Institute of Sciences and the founding of two high schools: the Boys&#x27; Lyceum and the Ladies&#x27; Lyceum.

Nevertheless, the program was never implemented, as Mariano Hurtado persuaded Governor Joaquín Angulo to abandon it. As a result, later that year, a decree was issued allowing the Institute of Sciences and the University of Guadalajara to coexist—though the university lost its funding and headquarters. In 1853, Governor José María Yáñez Carrillo decreed the assimilation of the Institute of Sciences into the University of Guadalajara, restoring the university&#x27;s traditional assets and status.

Around 1855, following the triumph of the Plan of Ayutla, Governor José Santos Degollado issued the second formal closure of the University of Guadalajara and reestablished the Institute of Sciences. However, during the Reform War, on 2 February 1859, Governor and Commander of Jalisco, Leonardo Márquez, reinstated the University of Guadalajara.

Despite this, following the military success of the liberal faction in 1860, Governor Pedro Ogazón issued the third formal closure of the University of Guadalajara. This decree also reestablished the Institute of Sciences, the Boys&#x27; Lyceum, and the Ladies&#x27; Lyceum.

=== The University Interregnum (1861–1925) ===
During this period, both higher education and high school education were fully controlled by the Government of Jalisco, which led to the rise of private schools. Despite this, the Schools of Medicine, Law, and Engineering, along with the Boys&#x27; Lyceum and the Ladies&#x27; Lyceum, continued to offer higher and high school education due to the governmental support they received. This support, however, was not consistent, as some governors, including Ramón Corona and Manuel Macario Dieguez, opposed it. In 1914, Dieguez closed the Lyceums and founded the Preparatoria Jalisco.

=== The University of Guadalajara (1925–1989) ===

In response to concerns expressed by many intellectuals and artists during meetings at the &quot;Centro Bohemio&quot;, a conference delivered by Engineer Juan Salvador Agraz Ramírez de Prado on a project to establish the &quot;National University of Guadalajara&quot;, and the new directions brought about by the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Governor José Guadalupe Zuno Hernández reopened the University of Guadalajara for the third time in 1925. He appointed Enrique Díaz de León as the university&#x27;s Rector.

As a result, the study plans for high schools and faculties, as well as the Organic Law, were developed and approved by the State Congress on 7 September 1925. During the university&#x27;s first meeting of the University Council, the institution&#x27;s motto was chosen: &quot;Piensa y Trabaja&quot; (Think and Work).

At the First Congress of Universities held in Mexico City, Rector Enrique Díaz de León supported socialist education. However, when he attempted to implement these reforms in Guadalajara, several student protests erupted. In response to the protests, Governor Sebastián Allende decided to close the University of Guadalajara once again.

To prevent the Autonomous University of Guadalajara from adopting the historic name of the University of Guadalajara, the State Congress reopened the university and appointed Constancio Hernández Alvirde as its twenty-ninth Rector.

=== The Jalisco University Network (1989–present) ===
During this period, the need to create a modern, efficient, qualified, and eco-friendly university was recognized. However, this required changes in the academic and administrative structure of the institution. These goals were outlined in the Institutional Development Programme: A Future Vision, presented in 1989 by Rector Raúl Padilla López, who is credited with modernizing the university. The document established the aims and programs for the university’s teaching, research, and extension areas, which were based on a series of projected indicators through 1995.

On 2 September 1989, the General University Council approved the document &quot;Bases for the Discussion about the Reform of the University of Guadalajara,&quot; which provided a current diagnostic of the university and proposed decentralizing the institution&#x27;s services and functions across its various entities. The document also presented key elements, including the updating and creation of study plans, the expansion of research and graduate studies, the promotion of cultural and sports activities, and the diversification of financial resources.

This reform was implemented when the State Congress approved the new Organic Law of the University of Guadalajara, which recognized the university&#x27;s autonomy in areas such as academic planning and financial administration. In the same year, the university created its thematic and regional campuses and established the High School Education System.

Additionally, the Labor Union of the Academic Workers of the University of Guadalajara was established, and the Labor Union of University Workers was strengthened. The Union of University Students was also founded. Among other changes resulting from the creation of the University Network, notable developments included the establishment of the Virtual University System and the University System of Radio, Television, and Cinematography.

In 2014, under the leadership of Rector Itzcóatl Tonatiuh Bravo Padilla, the Institutional Development Programme was updated with projections extending to 2030. Additionally, plans were initiated to build a new regional university campus in Zapotlanejo, Jalisco. Currently, the University Network is present in every region of Jalisco, with campuses located in 109 of the 125 municipalities in the state.

Since 2005, Calle 2 has functioned as a multifunctional entertainment facility. It is composed of seven pavilions, two forums, three concourses, and one arena. The venue can host fairs, exhibitions, concerts, as well as social and sports events, with a capacity of 80,000 people.

=== Cavaret Studio Theater ===
The Cavatet Studio Theater was established to meet the need for facilities in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area that could host alternative shows of national and international renown. It serves as a space for recreation, entertainment, and the production of cultural and sports events, conventions, exhibitions, and concerts of various genres.

=== Vivian Blumenthal Theater ===
The Vivian Blumenthal Theater was established to bring classic theater productions closer to the community and to promote their widespread appreciation. This cultural space is equipped to host theater projects as well as a variety of music performances. It serves as a stimulus for artistic and cultural activities in the city, offering a platform for high-quality shows that involve local, national, and international productions. The theater is considered a significant venue for multidisciplinary arts experimentation and proposals.

=== Jalisco Experimental Theater ===
The Jalisco Experimental Theater, designed by architect Eric Coufal, was opened on 6 December 1960 and is part of the National Cultural Heritage. Built by the Jalisco State Government in the 1950s, the theater is located within the Agua Azul Park. It is owned by the Jalisco State Government and managed by the University of Guadalajara.

== University Cultural Center ==
The University Cultural Center is the first university cultural complex in the mid-west region of Mexico, currently under construction in the city of Zapopan, Jalisco. Once completed, it will house the largest and most significant cultural space in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area, serving as the venue for thousands of cultural and academic activities.

The University Cultural Center will integrate university campuses, art schools, media facilities, thematic and archaeological parks, as well as sports and residential areas. It is also home to the Telmex Auditorium, Bicentenary Plaza, and the &quot;Juan José Arreola&quot; Public Library of the State of Jalisco. Additionally, two projects are currently under construction: the Environmental Sciences Museum and the Performing Arts Complex.

=== &quot;Juan José Arreola&quot; Public Library of the State of Jalisco ===
The &quot;Juan José Arreola&quot; Public Library of the State of Jalisco aims to preserve, protect, and provide free access to its extensive collection of contemporary and historical books. With the largest bibliography in the state and a vast number of historical documents (some dating back 500 years), the library is a significant space for study and research. The library has been under the administration of the University of Guadalajara since 1925. In 1975, it was relocated to a section of the Jalisco House of Culture building. In 2001, the University General Council renamed it the &quot;Juan José Arreola&quot; Public Library of the State of Jalisco in honor of the writer who had served as its headmaster from 1991 until his death in 2001.

In 2011, the library&#x27;s collection was relocated to a new building, which serves as the entrance to the University Cultural Center. The new library building houses approximately 3 million books, representing around 500 years of history, not only from the state of Jalisco but also from northern Mexico and the southeastern United States.

=== Telmex Auditorium ===
The Telmex Auditorium was inaugurated on 1 September 2007 and is currently one of the most important performance venues in Latin America. Designed by Mexican architect José de Arimatea Moyao, the auditorium is located in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area and is part of the University Cultural Center, the University of Guadalajara&#x27;s most significant and transcendent cultural project.

=== Performing Arts Complex ===
This project, which was scheduled to open at the end of 2015, aims to promote the development of performing arts in the region. It will consist of four halls and an outdoor stage dedicated to hosting performances. The project is designed to address the need for local production and will primarily be used for theater. Its venues will accommodate a variety of events, including opera, symphonic concerts, musical theater, dance, films, visual arts, and conferences. Additionally, the spaces will be used for book presentations and other cultural events.

=== Center of Transdisciplinary Instrumentation and Services ===
This project of the University of Guadalajara, to be located at the University Cultural Center, will feature four units dedicated to microscopy, spectroscopy, molecular biology, proteomics, and bioinformatics. These units will enable the classification of biological, medical, industrial, and environmental samples. The objective of the center is to enhance the research efforts of approximately 400 researchers across the university&#x27;s various campuses.

=== Environmental Sciences Museum ===
The Environmental Sciences Museum will be the first of its kind in Mexico, dedicated to showcasing the natural and social environments of the region, the nation, and the continent. Its aim is to present topics related to the environment, nature, culture, and the sustainability of life on Earth in an engaging manner. The museum will be closely linked to the regional identity of Jalisco which, along with Guadalajara, encompasses a design based on five sustainability pillars: ecology, economy, politics, culture, and society. Additionally, it will address contemporary issues concerning sustainability in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area.

== University System of Radio, Television, and Cinematography ==

These programmes include musical, cultural, and informational content.

=== University of Guadalajara Radio Network ===
The University of Guadalajara Radio Network is a project composed of eight radio stations that cover the mid-west region of Mexico.

== Collaboration with the Guadalajara Civil Hospital ==
The Guadalajara Civil Hospital is a health institution located in Guadalajara, Jalisco, since the 17th century. It was founded in 1794 by Guadalajara&#x27;s Bishop, Fray Antonio Alcalde y Barriga, as a partner institution of the University of Guadalajara. Since its founding, the hospital has served as the university&#x27;s hospital school, where students and academics from the health divisions conduct professional practices and research, respectively. 

Currently, the Civil Hospital, which has been a decentralized body of the Jalisco State Government since 1997, operates two hospital units: the Friar Antonio Alcalde Hospital and the Dr. Juan I. Menchaca Hospital. These units serve 29% of the population of Jalisco. The hospital&#x27;s original building was the San Miguel de Belén Hospital, which was later renamed and is now known as the Friar Antonio Alcalde Old Civil Hospital.

== University of Guadalajara in Los Angeles (UDGLA) ==
The University of Guadalajara extends its reach beyond borders to offer academic opportunities to Mexicans living in Los Angeles, while simultaneously fostering connections with their Latin American roots. UDGLA works to improve the quality of life and social integration of co-national migrants and Hispanics by enhancing their cultural knowledge and education through various cultural and academic projects.

=== Los Angeles Spanish-Language Book Fair (LéaLA) ===
LéaLA is an event aimed at promoting Spanish-language books and recognizing the Latin American population, its culture, and customs. It is an initiative supported by the University of Guadalajara in Los Angeles and the Guadalajara International Book Fair. The event features presentations of Spanish-language books, conferences on the culture and historical roots of Latin American countries, meetings with writers from Latin America and other regions, discussion forums on book sales and distribution challenges, and participation by Latin American celebrities in various cultural and literary activities. These efforts aim to foster a reading culture and generate interest in the written word, particularly among children.

=== Guadalajara International Film Festival in Los Angeles ===
This festival serves as a window to the world of contemporary Mexican and Hispanic cinema and as an extension of the Guadalajara International Film Festival. The objectives of the festival are to increase access to Mexican and Hispanic films, create a bridge between the Mexican and American film industries, foster collaborations between international filmmakers, and enhance the presence of Mexican and Hispanic films in the United States.

<doc id="836015" wikidata="Q605342" url="?curid=836015" title="Sympathy for the Devil">
<text>&quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is a song by English rock band the Rolling Stones. The song was written by Mick Jagger and credited to the Jagger–Richards partnership. It is the opening track on the band&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;. The song has received critical acclaim and features on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list, being ranked number 106 in the 2021 edition.

==Inspiration==
&quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is credited to Jagger and Richards, though the song was largely a Jagger composition. The working title of the song was &quot;The Devil Is My Name&quot;, having earlier been called &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. Jagger sings in first person narrative as the Devil, who boasts of his role in each of several historical atrocities and repeatedly asks the listener to &quot;guess my name.&quot; The singer demands the listener&#x27;s courtesy towards him, implicitly chastising the listeners for their collective culpability in the listed killings and crimes. In the 2012 documentary &quot;Crossfire Hurricane&quot;, Jagger stated that his influence for the song came from Baudelaire and from the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (which had just appeared in English translation in 1967). The book was given to Jagger by Marianne Faithfull and she confirmed the inspiration in an interview with Sylvie Simmons for the magazine &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2005.

In a 1995 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jagger said, &quot;that was taken from an old idea of Baudelaire&#x27;s, I think, but I could be wrong. Sometimes when I look at my Baudelaire books, I can&#x27;t see it in there. But it was an idea I got from French writing. And I just took a couple of lines and expanded on it. I wrote it as sort of like a Bob Dylan song.&quot; It was Keith Richards who suggested changing the tempo and using additional percussion, turning the folk song into a samba.

Jagger stated in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview: &quot;it&#x27;s a very long historical figurethe figures of evil and figures of goodso it is a tremendously long trail he&#x27;s made as personified in this piece.&quot; By the time &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; was released, the Rolling Stones had already caused controversy for sexually forward lyrics such as &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; and their cover of the Willie Dixon&#x27;s blues &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot;. There were also claims they had dabbled in Satanism (their previous album, while containing no direct Satanic references in its music or lyrics, was titled &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;). &quot;Sympathy&quot; brought these concerns to the fore, provoking media rumors and fears among some religious groups that the Stones were devil worshippers and a corrupting influence on youth.

The lyrics focus on atrocities in mankind&#x27;s history from Satan&#x27;s point of view, including the trial and death of Jesus Christ, The Hundred Years&#x27; War, the violence of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the 1918 execution of the Romanov family during World War I, and World War II. The song was originally written with a line asking who shot John F. Kennedy, but after Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on 5 June 1968, the line was changed to reference both assassinations.

The song may have been spared further controversy when the first single from the same album, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, became even more controversial in view of the race riots and student protests occurring in many cities in Europe and in the United States.

==Recording==
The recording of &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; began at London&#x27;s Olympic Sound Studios on 4 June 1968; overdubs were done on 8, 9 and 10 June. Personnel included on the recording include Nicky Hopkins on piano, Rocky Dijon on congas and Bill Wyman on shekere. Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, photographer Michael Cooper, Wyman, and Richards performed backup vocals. Richards plays bass on the original recording, and also electric guitar. Brian Jones plays a mostly mixed out acoustic guitar, although in isolated tracks of the studio cut, it is audible playing along with the piano.

In the 2003 book &quot;According to the Rolling Stones&quot;, Watts commented:
On the overall power of the song, Jagger continued in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;:
The backing vocals came about by accident by producer Jimmy Miller and Anita Pallenberg. Pallenberg was in the engineering booth with Miller while Jagger was belting out an early vocal take of the song. According to Pallenberg, Miller was half talking to himself as Jagger sang, saying &quot;Who, who?&quot; He then repeated the words several times as Jagger sang on, and Pallenberg realized how wonderful that all sounded. After the take, she told Jagger what transpired in the booth and suggested that &quot;who who&quot; be used in the song as a backing vocal chant. The Stones then gave it a go and after the first take, &quot;Who who&quot; became &quot;woo-woo&quot;, with most of this caught on film by director Jean-Luc Godard for his &quot;One Plus One&quot; ( &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;) movie.

==Legacy==
Of the change in public perception the band experienced after the song&#x27;s release, Richards said in a 1971 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Before, we were just innocent kids out for a good time, they&#x27;re saying, &#x27;They&#x27;re evil, they&#x27;re evil.&#x27; Oh, I&#x27;m evil, really? So that makes you start thinking about evil ... What is evil? Half of it, I don&#x27;t know how many people think of Mick as the devil or as just a good rock performer or what? There are black magicians who think we are acting as unknown agents of Lucifer and others who think we are Lucifer. Everybody&#x27;s Lucifer.&quot;

Hunter S. Thompson and his attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta kept replaying the song hundreds of times during their drug-induced road trip to Las Vegas in 1971 to maintain focus whilst high. In Thompson&#x27;s novel, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; and the film of the same name, the song is referenced several times.

Contrary to a widespread misconception, it was &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; and not &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; that the Stones were performing when Meredith Hunter was killed at the Altamont Free Concert. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s early articles on the incident typically misreported that the killing took place during &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, but the Stones in fact played &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; earlier in the concert; it was interrupted by a fight and restarted, Jagger commenting, &quot;We&#x27;re always havingsomething very funny happens when we start that number.&quot; Several other songs were performed before Hunter was killed.

&quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is considered the band&#x27;s &quot;ode to madness&quot; by The Washington Post&#x27;s Paul Schwartzman. The song has been played more than 800 times by the Rolling Stones during live performances, and appears on their live albums &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out!&quot;, &quot;Love You Live&quot;, and &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, among others.

=== Lyrics ===
The song&#x27;s verse &quot;I shouted out, ‘Who killed the Kennedys?&#x27; / When after all, it was &quot;you and me&quot;.&quot; is considered by critic Robert Christgau to be a commentary about how &quot;this is a world where people get killed and all of us, to one extent or another, are implicated in the fact that this is that world.&quot; This lyric was noted in 2024 by Schwartzman as being omitted from the song since approximately 2006 in live performance. Christgau believes this was possibly done due to its lack of relevance &quot;to the younger audience&quot;.

==Avant-garde film==

&quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is also the title of a 1968 film by Godard, also titled &quot;One Plus One&quot;. A depiction of the late 1960s American counterculture, the film primarily featured the Rolling Stones in the process of recording the song in the studio. On the filming, Jagger said in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;[it was] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a film of us in the studio. I mean, it would never happen now, to get someone as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. We could have been recording &#x27;My Obsession&#x27;. But it was &#x27;Sympathy for the Devil&#x27;, and it became the track that we used.&quot;

During the several days of recording the Stones as they played, a film lamp set up by Godard&#x27;s crew started a major fire in the studio that caused substantial damage to the studio and laid waste to some of the band&#x27;s equipment. However, the song&#x27;s tapes were saved by Miller before he fled the studio, and Godard kept his cameras rolling capturing the fire on film as it roared on.

==Guns N&#x27; Roses version==
Guns N&#x27; Roses recorded a cover in 1994 which reached number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; it was featured in the closing credits of Neil Jordan&#x27;s film adaptation of Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; and was included on their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. This cover is noteworthy for causing an incident involving incoming guitarist Paul &quot;Huge&quot; Tobias, that was partially responsible for guitarist Slash departing from the band in 1996. Slash has described the Guns N&#x27; Roses version of the song as &quot;the sound of the band breaking up&quot;.

Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, who does not appear on the recording, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band: 
This was the band&#x27;s final single until 2018&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; to feature guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan.

<text>Albert E. Todd (August 5, 1878 – October 26, 1928) served as mayor of Victoria, British Columbia Canada from 1917 to 1919. He was seen as a visionary whose impact was felt both during his term and after. He was born to Jacob Hunter Todd and Rosanna Wigley in 1878.

One of the first licensed drivers in the city, he was keen on promoting the city as a tourist destination and making it easier to get around town.

During his time in office he envisioned a crossing over the harbour to the west side (which later became the Johnson Street Bridge), saw through the installation of the now iconic cluster of street lights around the downtown area and promoted the Malahat Drive. He died at the age of 50 in 1928.

<text>The Signet Society is a literary and art recognition final club at Harvard University. It was founded in 1870 by members of the class of 1871. The Signet celebrates most of the arts, including music, the visual arts, and theater. 

== History ==

The Signet Society was founded in 1870 by members of the class of 1871. The first president was Charles Joseph Bonaparte. It was, at first, dedicated to the production of literary work only, going so far as to exclude debate and even theatrical productions. According to &quot;The Harvard book&quot;It seemed to the founders that there was room in the College world for another association that should devote itself more exclusively to literary work than is possible with large numbers. Accordingly, they confined the membership to a few and required that new members shall be, so far as possible, &quot;representative men,&quot; and that at least five should be in the first half of their class.

The opening remarks of the Signet&#x27;s minutes state: &quot;On Tuesday evening, November 1, 1870, a meeting was held at 10 Grays Hall preliminary to the organization of a senior society, which was to afford to a select number a pleasant means of intercourse with each other, not to be expected from the illiberal policy of the only society of reputation existing.&quot; This &quot;illiberal policy&quot; refers to the displeasure with which the founders of the Signet greeted the established Final Clubs. These first members formed the society&#x27;s admissions criteria to transcend the social politics that they perceived as dominating in the Final Club system.

To distinguish the Signet from other exclusive organizations, the founding members stated in the original charter that members would be chosen according to &quot;merit and accomplishment.&quot; Today, those membership criteria are still present in the club&#x27;s constitution mandating that members &quot;shall be chosen about their intellectual, literary and artistic ability and achievements.&quot; While these criteria are central to the put-up process (admissions procedure), personal character is also considered. The Signet celebrates most of the arts, including music, the visual arts, and theater. 

After a few years in quarters on university property, the Signet moved to an off-campus location at 46 Dunster Street.

== Symbols ==
The emblem of the Signet was, at one time, &quot;a signet-ring enclosing a nettle,&quot; the signet-ring symbolizing unity and the nettle symbolizing impartiality. The emblem which appears over the door of the Signet includes a beehive and bees, and a legend in Ancient Greek: &#x27; -- &quot;Create art, and live it.&quot; Another motto of the Society is attributed to Virgil: &#x27; -- &quot;So do you bees make honey, not for yourselves.&quot; From this comes the Society&#x27;s tradition of referring to its undergraduate members as &quot;drones.&quot; The society&#x27;s colors are gold and black.

The Signet eschews initiation rituals common to Harvard&#x27;s Final Clubs and the &quot;Lampoon&quot; in favor of an induction, during which each new member receives a red rose. The rose is to be kept, dried and returned to the Signet Society upon the publication of the member&#x27;s first substantial published work. The Signet maintains a library of these works, which were originally literary, but now include programs or other artifacts marking the performance of music, films, or displays of the visual artistry of members. Dried roses hang on the walls of the Signet near the works that occasioned their return. Particularly noteworthy is T. S. Eliot&#x27;s rose, which hangs along with his original letter of acceptance to the society.

== Activities ==
Since 1910, the Signet has hosted an Annual Dinner honoring poets, authors, musicians, and social commentators. The Signet has a longstanding, reciprocal relationship with the Elizabethan Club, (or &quot;The Lizzie&quot;) of Yale University. The two organizations sporadically hold a lawn croquet tournament, for which a handled and engraved silver pudding cup in a mahogany case serves as the trophy.

An alumni corporation administers the Signet&#x27;s endowment, property, and staff. Since 2010, the Society has hosted Artists-in-Residence in a second-floor apartment.

== Membership ==
Signet membership is open to any undergraduate student at Harvard. It admits both men and women without prejudice, unlike final clubs. Membership in Signet celebrates achievement in the arts, including music, the visual arts, and theater. Members are active in most undergraduate publications and organizations, including the &quot;Harvard Advocate&quot;, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;, the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;, the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra, and the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club. Membership dues are required but are pro-rated by Harvard&#x27;s financial aid calculations, allowing all members of the college community to be considered for membership. Harvard faculty and administrators have been and are Signet officers, associates, and members.

A select number of individuals working in the arts in the Cambridge community or wider Harvard community are elected to join Signet as part of The Signet Affiliates Program. These members include administrators, Harvard alumni, fellows, instructors, scholars, and visiting artists. 

== Residence ==

The Signet Society&#x27;s residence is located at 46 Dunster Street in Cambridge. Architectural historian Douglass Shand-Tucci includes an in-depth discussion of Signet&#x27;s building in his history of Harvard&#x27;s campus, relating the oddity that a firm known for its preeminence in Gothic Revival was employed to renovate an 1820s Colonial residence (converted in 1880 to a Victorian clubhouse) into a neo-Federal structure with baroque details. Regarding its distinctive features, Shand-Tucci writes:
It is in feeling wildly Baroque (of all things)—a welcome touch of flamboyance for what would otherwise have been a rather staid clubhouse for the Signet... the graphic quality of Cram &amp; Goodhue&#x27;s and LaRose&#x27;s new frontispiece is actually rather reminiscent of book design (not to mention the Palladianism of several Tory Row mansions), and centers on a two story pedimented Ionic pavilion displaying the Signet arms... The design concept- cavalier enough, but very successful—discloses another guise of history-making in Harvard architecture: to restore the house, not as it originally was, but in LaRose&#x27;s words, as it &quot;ought to have been.&quot; Thus the architectural solecism of the two orders of the porch—the Doric columns and Ionic pilasters—was retained.

==Notable members==
==Controversy==
One of the Signet Society&#x27;s &quot;gravest mistakes&quot; was their rejection of cellist Yo-Yo Ma while he was an undergraduate at Harvard.

<doc id="836067" wikidata="Q3064584" url="?curid=836067" title="Win, Lose or Draw">
<text>Win, Lose or Draw is an American television game show that aired from 1987 to 1990 in syndication and on NBC. It was taped at CBS Television City (one of the few non-CBS game shows to tape there), often in Studios 31, 33, and 43 at various times. It was co-produced by Burt &amp; Bert Productions (headed by Burt Reynolds and Bert Convy, the original host of the syndicated version) and Kline &amp; Friends for Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista Television. It has also had two versions on The Disney Channel: &quot;Teen Win, Lose or Draw&quot; from 1989 to 1992, and a revived version known as &quot;Disney&#x27;s Win, Lose or Draw&quot; which aired in 2014. &quot;New York&quot; described &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; as &quot;a knockoff&quot; of the board game &quot;Pictionary&quot;, however, Burt Reynolds and Ed McMahon referred to playing the game at Burt&#x27;s home during the August 2, 1978 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, three years before Pictionary was created.

The set for the original &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; was modeled after Burt Reynolds&#x27; living room.

==Broadcast history==
A pilot with Bert Convy as host was taped on November 2, 1986, at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California, and featured Loni Anderson, Betty White, Burt Reynolds, and Tony Danza playing the game, with Rod Roddy announcing. The pilot, produced by Reynolds and Convy, garnered the interest of both the NBC network and various local stations nationwide; thus, two separate editions of the program were sold and produced with production beginning in June 1987.

On September 7, 1987, &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; was launched with Kline and Friends joining Burt &amp; Bert Productions as a second production company. Vicki Lawrence hosted the edition produced for NBC, which inherited the 11:30 a.m. Eastern timeslot that had been occupied by &quot;Scrabble&quot; for three years prior to its premiere. The syndicated edition, premiering that same day, was hosted by Bert Convy. Bob Hilton announced for the daytime series, with Gene Wood performing those duties for the syndicated series, while Hilton occasionally filled in on the latter version, and Johnny Gilbert and Dean Goss did so on the daytime show.

Lawrence, with the exception of a month in 1988 when Sally Struthers hosted in her place, hosted the daytime &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; for its entire two-year run. The daytime version faced off against the second half of the hit CBS game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and the ABC talk show &quot;Home&quot; (which expanded to an hour in January 1989). NBC canceled the daytime series in the summer of 1989, and its final episode aired on September 1 of that year. Meanwhile, Robb Weller began hosting the third season of the syndicated series later that month after Convy opted to host a new production for his company, &quot;3rd Degree&quot;. The final new episode aired on June 1, 1990; reruns of the series continued to air until the show was withdrawn from syndication on August 31, 1990.

Reruns of the syndicated version aired on the USA Network from January 1, 1991, to December 24, 1992, and on Game Show Network from April 15, 2002, to March 14, 2004.

During its run, the syndicated &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; made several road trips, including Hawaii, Central Park in New York City, Burt Reynolds&#x27; ranch in Jupiter, Florida, Walt Disney World, Disneyland and Navy Pier in Chicago.

==Gameplay==
The idea is similar to the game Pictionary. Two teams, men versus women, each composed of two celebrities and one contestant (or a celebrity and two college students in the College Tournament in 1988), took turns guessing a phrase, title or thing, and one teammate was drawing on a large pad of paper with markers. Each team sat on a couch on a set designed after Burt Reynolds&#x27; actual living room at the time. The team member doing the drawing could not speak about the subject in his or her drawing and could not use letters, numbers, or symbols. If one of these illegal clues was used, any money won in that puzzle was split between the two teams. However, if a non-drawing team member mentioned a word that was part of the answer, their teammate at the sketch pad was then allowed to write it down.

In the first three rounds, each team had one minute to solve a puzzle, earning $200 ($250 in the pilot) for a correct guess. At the thirty-second mark, a doorbell sounded (or fanfare during the College Tournament in 1988), and the drawing player had the option of handing the marker off to one of his/her teammates, but the puzzle value would then be cut in half. If the team did not guess within the time limit, the opposing team was given one chance to confer and guess. If they gave the correct answer, they were awarded the money; if not, no money was awarded. By 1989, the first round was later changed to have the drawing contestant sketch a series of clues to a puzzle, one clue at a time. If the team guessed the puzzle from the identified clues, they scored $200.

Following round three, one player for each team was nominated to draw clues in a 90-second speed round. The topics for drawing were simpler for this round compared to those in previous rounds. Each correct guess was worth $100, and the team could only pass twice. The speed round started with the team that was ahead. The team with the most money at the end of the game won, and the contestant on the winning team received $1,000 in addition to the money they had already earned. If both teams were tied at the end of the speed round, each contestant earned $500. By the end of the daytime version&#x27;s run, the speed round was decreased to 60 seconds and $50 a word.

===Bonus Round===
The daytime series underwent another significant change towards the end of its run, which was eliminating the $1,000 bonus and instead replacing it with a bonus round, which the series had not seen in either iteration to this point. This change coincided with one that added an additional civilian contestant to each team in place of a celebrity.

The bonus round was played similar to the speed round, except that players were allowed to pass multiple times. The first word was worth $50 and each correct answer that followed doubled the bank. Passing resulted in the bank resetting to zero and the contestant had to start building a new bank.

Originally, the bonus was played with as many words as possible within the time limit. Under this format a team was able to win $25,600 in one round, guessing ten words without a miss. Afterwards, the scoring format was adjusted, this time, if the winning team correctly identified seven words within the time limit of 90 seconds, regardless of how many passes were used, they won $5,000.

===Audience game===
If there was extra time at the end of the show, an audience member would be called on stage and given the opportunity to sketch a subject for either the men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s team to guess in 60 seconds, much like the main rounds, with $100 awarded if the chosen team was able to identify the subject.

===1989–1990 changes===
The third and last season of the syndicated &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; saw a significant format overhaul itself, as the front game was altered, and both the shortened speed round and bonus round were added.

The object of the first two rounds was the same. However, the drawing team was not allowed to switch partners at any point. A guess could not be made until twenty-five of the sixty seconds had elapsed, and if the team guessed the puzzle before thirty seconds had elapsed the civilian contestant won $200. If not, the puzzle was played for $100. A successful steal by the opposing team was only worth $50.

If the game ended in a tie, a tie-breaker was played with the last team to play the speed round going first. The player at the board was given the choice of two words and began drawing, trying to convey the word as fast as he/she could. Once the word was guessed, the opposing team had to guess their word in a faster time. Doing so won the game; if not, the first team won the game.

At this point, the show began to use returning champions, who stayed on for ten days or until defeated, whichever came first.

==Disney Channel versions==
===&quot;Teen Win, Lose or Draw&quot;===
From April 29, 1989, to April 28, 1990, and again from September 10, 1990, to September 26, 1992, Disney Channel aired a version called &quot;Teen Win, Lose or Draw&quot;. This version was hosted by Marc Price. Jay Wolpert produced the first season, which taped at the Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, with Stone-Stanley Productions taking over for the rest of the run, at which time production also moved to Hollywood Center Studios in Los Angeles. Originally the show aired on Saturdays at 6:30 p.m. and Sunday mornings at 11:30 a.m. Rotating as announcers during the first season were Brandy Brown, Chase Hampton and Tiffini Hale from &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, with Mark L. Walberg taking over that duty for the final two seasons. Teams were made up of two teenage contestants (one each of two boys and two girls), and a teenage celebrity. Gameplay was largely identical to the original run, with the following differences:

* Round 1 – The Clue Round: A player from each team draw as many words within 60 seconds. Each of the words was a clue to a puzzle – a person, place, thing, event, etc. The team in control had the first chance to answer, if they were unable to give the correct answer, the opposing team could guess to win the points.
* Round 2 – The Phrase Round: The team is given a category, with the phrase based in that category. As in the original, the clue-giver could hand off to a teammate after 30 seconds.
* Round 3 – The Speed Round: Played identically to the adult version, with the trailing team going first (or the team that went first in round one playing first if the score was tied). A grand prize was given to the winning team, with the losing team getting a consolation gift.
* If the score was tied following the Speed Round, each team would play another speed round with 20 seconds on the clock. The team that got more in the 20 seconds won. If the tie persisted after this overtime round, each team would try to guess one word as fast as possible (with a maximum of 60 seconds), and the team that was faster won.

===Disney&#x27;s &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;===

In April 2013, the Disney Channel announced a new version of &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, to be hosted by Justin Willman, which premiered on January 17, 2014. As with &quot;Teen Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, the two teams on each program are made up of two young contestants plus a teenage celebrity (this time, from a Disney Channel or Disney XD program). New motion-control technology is featured.

==Home versions==
===Board game===
Milton Bradley Company created its version in 1987. It could be played like the TV show, or a variation of the game with pawns and a game board. Party, Junior, and Travel Junior editions were produced, plus a Refill Pack for the game. All contestants who appeared on the show received a copy of the Party edition, as did select audience members.

===Computer and video games===
Hi Tech Expressions released two editions of the DOS version of the game in 1988, as well as a &quot;Junior&quot; version, followed by a version for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989. Both versions of this party game featured a scene set in a living room, with the game contestants (representing real-life players) seated on opposite couches, much like the television show. While the game system drew a picture on the screen, one of the players would have a limited amount (60 seconds for the main game, and 90 for the speed round) of time to type in the word or phrase represented by the image. If the player typed in the incorrect answer, a player on the opposing team would have an opportunity to type the correct answer (in single-player games, the game system would type a random incorrect answer). The team that typed the correct answer would win money for that round, and the team that earned the most money at the end of the game won.

A &quot;plug-and-play&quot; console version was released by Senario in 2005; unlike the earlier computer and console adaptations, this one allowed players to actually draw the subjects, using an electronic pen, for their teammates to guess.
