<doc id="817438" wikidata="Q3595371" url="?curid=817438" title="Law enforcement in India">
<text>Law enforcement in India is imperative to keep Law and order in the nation. Indian law is enforced by a number of agencies. India has a multi-layered law enforcement structure with both federal and state/union territory level agencies, including specialized ones with specific jurisdictions. Unlike many federal nations, the constitution of India delegates the maintenance of law and order primarily to the states and territories. 

Under the Constitution, police is a subject governed by states. Therefore, each of the 28 states have their own police forces.  The centre is also allowed to maintain its own police forces to assist the states with ensuring law and order.  Therefore, it maintains seven central armed police forces and some other central police organisations for specialised tasks such as intelligence gathering, investigation, research and record-keeping, and training.

At the federal level, some of India&#x27;s Central Armed Police Forces are part of the Ministry of Home Affairs and support the states. Larger cities have their own police forces under their respective state police (except the Kolkata Police that is autonomous and reports to state&#x27;s Home Department). All senior officers in the state police forces and federal agencies are members of the Indian Police Service (IPS). India has some special tactical forces both on the federal and state level to deal with terrorist attacks and counter insurgencies like Mumbai Police Quick Response Team, National Security Guard, Anti-Terrorism Squad, Delhi Police SWAT, Special Operations Group (Jammu and Kashmir), etc.

==Central agencies==

The Central Government has established a number of Central Police Organisations (CPOs) to fulfill diverse law enforcement and security roles. 
These CPOs can be broadly categorized into two groups: 

Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs): These are armed police forces responsible for internal security, counter-insurgency operations, and border guarding. They include organizations such as the Assam Rifles, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB). 

Central Police Organisations (CPOs): This group comprises organizations that perform specialized functions such as police research and development, criminal investigation, intelligence gathering, police training and forensic science. These include:
* Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&amp;D): Conducts research and development in police science and technology.
* Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI): Investigates serious crimes of national importance, corruption and economic crimes.
* Directorate of Coordination of Police Wireless (DCPW): Coordinates wireless communication among police forces.
* Intelligence Bureau (IB): Collects intelligence to counter internal security threats.
* National Investigation Agency (NIA): specialised counter-terrorism law enforcement agency.
* Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB): Investigation and intelligence of narcotics crimes.
* National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB): Maintains a national database of crime statistics.
* National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science (NICFS): Provides training and research in criminology and forensic science.
* National Disaster Response Force (NDRF): Responsible for disaster management and emergency services in times of calamities.
In addition, there are Police Training institutions, such as the National Police Academy (NPA) and the North Eastern Police Academy (NEPA). There is a Railway Protection Force (RPF) that functions under the control of the Ministry of Railways.

Some intelligence and investigating agencies under the Ministry of Finance also do policing work. They are involved in collecting intelligence and investigating economic offences pertaining to customs, excise, income tax, foreign exchange, money laundering, and narcotics smuggling. Some of these are the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau, Directorate General of Revenue Intelligence, Directorate of Enforcement, Financial Intelligence Unit, Directorate General of GST Intelligence, and Directorate General of Income Tax (Investigation). 

Most federal law-enforcement agencies are under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The head of each agency is typically an IPS officer. The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order and policing to the states and territories, and almost all routine policing—including the apprehension of criminals—is done by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organization by authorizing the creation of the Indian Police Service.

Central police forces can assist a state&#x27;s police force if requested by a state government. During the 1975–77 Emergency, the constitution was amended on 1 February 1976 to permit the central government to deploy its armed police forces without state permission. The amendment was unpopular, and use of the central police forces was controversial. After the Emergency was lifted, the constitution was again amended in December 1978 to restore the status quo.

===Ministry of Home Affairs===
The principal national ministry concerned with law enforcement is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which supervises a large number of government functions and agencies operated and administered by the central government. The ministry is concerned with matters pertaining to the maintenance of public peace and order, the staffing and administration of the public services, delineation of internal boundaries, and the administration of union territories.

In addition to controlling the IPS, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintains several agencies and organizations dealing with police and security. Police forces in the union territories are under the MHA. The Minister of Home Affairs is the cabinet minister responsible for the ministry; the Home Secretary, an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, is the ministry&#x27;s administrative head.

===Central Armed Police Forces===
====Border Security Force====
The Border Security Force (BSF) is responsible for policing India&#x27;s land borders in peacetime and preventing trans-border crimes. A central police force under the Ministry of Home Affairs, its duties include VIP security, election supervision, guarding vital installations and counter-naxal operations.

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, which highlighted the inadequacy of the existing border-management system, led to the formation of the Border Security Force as a unified central armed police force mandated with guarding India&#x27;s boundary with Pakistan. The BSF&#x27;s policing capability was used in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, against the Pakistani Armed Forces, in areas which were the least threatened. During wartime or when ordered by the central government, the BSF is commanded by the Indian Army; BSF troops participated in the 1971 Battle of Longewala in this capacity. After the 1971 war (which led to the creation of Bangladesh), responsibility for policing the border with Bangladesh was assigned to the force.

Originally charged with guarding India&#x27;s external borders, the BSF has been tasked with counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations. When insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir broke out in 1989 and the Jammu and Kashmir state police and the thinly-deployed Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) needed extra force to cope with spiraling violence, the central government deployed the BSF to Jammu and Kashmir to combat Kashmiri militants.

BSF operates a Tear-Smoke Unit at its academy in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, which supplies tear gas and smoke shells for riot prevention to all state police forces. It operates dog squads, and runs the National Dog Training and Research Centre. The BSF, one of several Indian police forces which have its own air and water wings, provides helicopter, dog and other support services to the state police.

====Central Industrial Security Force====
The Central Industrial Security Force&#x27;s (CISF) primary task is to provide industrial security. It guards industrial installations nationwide which are owned by the central government, secures seaports and airports, and provides security for certain non-governmental organizations. The CISF provides security for nuclear-power plants, space installations, mints, oil fields and refineries, heavy-engineering and steel plants, barrages, fertilizer units, hydroelectric and thermal power stations, and other installations partially (or wholly) run by the government.

====Central Reserve Police Force====
The Central Reserve Police Force&#x27;s (CRPF) main objective is to assist states and union territories&#x27; law-enforcement agencies in maintaining law and order and containing insurgency. It is deployed as an anti-terrorist unit in several regions, and operates abroad as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions.

====Indo-Tibetan Border Police====
The 90,000-member Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) is responsible for security along the Indo-Tibetan border and its surrounding areas. ITBP personnel are trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security.
They were also deployed to Indian diplomatic missions located in Afghanistan.

====National Security Guard====
The National Security Guard (NSG) is a commando unit originally created for counter-terrorism and hostage-rescue missions. Founded in 1986, it is popularly known as the &quot;Black Cats&quot; for its uniform. Like most military and elite-security units in India, it avoids the media and the Indian public is largely unaware of its capabilities and operational details.

The NSG draws its core members from the Indian Army, and the balance is support staff from other central police units. An NSG team and a transport aircraft is stationed at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, ready to deploy in 30 minutes.

====Sashastra Seema Bal====
Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), founded in 1963, is deployed at the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders. SSB, with over 82,000 personnel, is trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security. Its personnel are also deployed to the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), Special Protection Group (SPG), National Security Guard. Officers begin as an assistant commandant (equivalent to deputy superintendent of police on a state force), and retire with the rank of inspector general (IG).

===Special Protection Group===
The Special Protection Group (SPG), the central government&#x27;s executive protection agency, is responsible for the protection of the Prime Minister of India and their immediate family. The force was established in 1985, after the assassination of Indira Gandhi. It provides daily, round-the-clock security throughout India to the present Prime Minister and his family.

===Central investigation and intelligence institutions===

====Central Bureau of Investigation====
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is India&#x27;s premier investigative agency, responsible for a wide variety of criminal and national security matters. Often cited as established with the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, it was formed by the central government (which controls the Delhi police) with a resolution. Its constitutionality was questioned in the Gauhati High Court &quot;Narendra Kumar vs Union of India&quot; case on the basis that all areas of policing are exclusive to state governments, and the CBI is a central-government agency. The court ruled that despite the lack of legislation, the CBI is an authorized agency of the central government for national policing. Its ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of India, which cited the CBI&#x27;s national importance.

The bureau is controlled by the Department of Personnel and Training in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions of the government of India, usually headed by the Prime Minister as the Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. India&#x27;s Interpol unit, the CBI draws its personnel from IPS officers throughout the country. Specializing in crimes involving high-ranking government officials and politicians, the CBI has also accepted other criminal cases because of media and public pressure (usually due to local-police investigative incompetence).

====Income Tax Department====
The Income Tax Department (ITD) is India&#x27;s premier financial agency, responsible for a wide variety of financial and fiscal matters. The department is controlled by the Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance, headed by a minister who reports directly to the prime minister. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is also part of the Department of Revenue. It provides input for policy and planning of direct taxes, and is responsible for the administration of direct-tax laws through the Income Tax Department. The CBDT operates in accordance with the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963. The board members, in their &quot;ex officio&quot; capacity, are also a division of the ministry dealing with matters relating to the levy and collection of taxes, tax evasion and revenue intelligence. It is India&#x27;s official Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) unit. The Income Tax Department draws its staff from Indian Revenue Service officers nationwide, and is responsible for the investigation of economic crimes and tax evasion. Some special agents and agents can carry firearms.

The Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) is headed by the Director General of Intelligence (Income Tax), which was created to address cross-border black money. The DCI conducts unobtrusive investigations of &quot;persons and transactions suspected to be involved in criminal activities having cross-border, inter-state or international ramifications, that pose a threat to national security and are punishable under the direct tax laws.&quot;

Commissioners of the ITD&#x27;s intelligence directorate posted in cities such as Delhi, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Lucknow will also conduct criminal investigations for the DCI. The ITD&#x27;s intelligence wing oversees the Central Information Branch (CIB), which has a repository of data on taxpayers&#x27; financial transactions.

====Directorate of Revenue Intelligence====
The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is an intelligence-based organization responsible for the coordination of India&#x27;s anti-smuggling efforts. Officers are drawn from the Indian Revenue Service and Group B of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs.

====Central Economic Intelligence Bureau====

The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB) is the intelligence agency responsible for gathering information and monitoring the economic and financial sectors for economic offenses and warfare.

====Directorate General of GST Intelligence====
The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), formerly the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence (DGCEI), is an intelligence-based organization responsible for tax evasion cases related to central excise duty and Goods and Service Tax (GST). Officers are drawn from the Indian Revenue Service and Group B of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs.

====National Investigation Agency====
The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the central agency combatting terrorism, can deal with interstate terror-related crimes without permission from the states. The National Investigation Agency Bill 2008, creating the agency, was moved in Parliament by the Home Minister on 16 December 2008. The NIA was created in response to the 2008 Mumbai attacks as a central counter-terrorism agency. Also dealing with drug trafficking and currency counterfeiting, it draws its officers from the IRS and the Indian Police Service.

====Narcotics Control Bureau====
The Narcotics Control Bureau is responsible for anti-narcotics operations nationwide, checking the spread of contraband and the cultivation of drugs. Officers in the bureau are drawn from the IPS and IRS.

====Bureau of Police Research and Development====
The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) was established on 28 August 1970 to modernize the police forces. It researches police issues, including training and the introduction of technology at the central and state levels.

====National Crime Records Bureau====
In 1979, the National Police Commission recommended the creation of agency to maintain criminal records and a database shareable at the federal and state levels. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) was established by combining the Directorate of Coordination Police Computers, the Central Fingerprint Bureau, the Data Section of Coordination Division of the Central Bureau of Investigation, and the Statistical Section of the Bureau of Police Research and Development.

===Central forensic institutions===

====Central Forensic Science Laboratory====
The Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), a wing of the Ministry of Home Affairs, houses the only DNA repository in South and Southeast Asia. There are seven central forensic laboratories: in Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Pune, Guwahati and New Delhi. CFSL Hyderabad is a centre of excellence in chemical sciences, CFSL Kolkata in biological sciences, and CFSL Chandigarh in the physical sciences. The laboratories are primarily controlled by the ministry&#x27;s Directorate of Forensic Science (DFS); the New Delhi lab is under the Central Bureau of Investigation, and investigates cases on its behalf.

====National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science====
The National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science (NICFS) was established on 4 January 1972 at the recommendation of a committee appointed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). In September 1979, the institute became a department of the Ministry of Home Affairs with a full-time director. It is headed by senior Indian Police Service officers. The institute trains in cybercrime investigations, and researches aspects of criminology and forensics (including cyber forensics). It is listed as a science and technology organization by the Department of Science and Technology.

==State police==
State police forces are organized under the purview of the state governments, with each state and union territory maintaining its own police force. The overarching authority for police matters lies with the state&#x27;s home department, led by an additional chief secretary or principal secretary, also known as the home secretary, typically an IAS officer. The state police force is headed by a Director General of Police (DGP), who is typically an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer.
The Police Act of 1861 provides the foundational framework for the organization and functioning of police forces in India. While there may be variations in equipment and resources among different state police forces, their organizational structure and operational patterns are generally similar.

Below the DGP, the police force is divided into police zones, ranges, districts, subdivisions, and police stations. Inspectors General (IGPs) head the police zones, while Deputy Inspectors General (DIGs) lead the police ranges. Superintendents of Police (SPs) command the district police headquarters and oversee subordinate units. Apart from the law and order wing, each state police consists of special wings such as the criminal investigations department, the intelligence wing, police training wing and the state armed police, headed by senior officers.

Police in the states and union territories are assisted by units of volunteer Home Guards under guidelines formulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

In most states and territories, police forces are divided into civil (unarmed) police and armed police contingents. Civil police staff police stations, conduct investigations, answer routine complaints, perform traffic duties, and patrol the streets. They usually carry lathis: bamboo staffs, weighted (or tipped) with iron.

Armed police are divided into two groups: district armed police/district armed reserve (DAR) and the State Armed Police Force or Provincial Armed Constabulary. District armed police are organized like an army infantry battalion. Assigned to police stations, they perform guard and escort duties. The district armed reserve police (DAR) functions under the respective district police units. States which maintain armed contingents use them as an emergency reserve strike force. The units are organized as a mobile armed force under state control or, in the case of district armed police (who are not as well equipped), as a force directed by district superintendents and generally used for riot control.

The Provincial Armed Constabulary or State Armed Police is an armed reserve maintained at key locations in some states and activated on orders from the deputy inspector general and higher-level authorities. Armed constabulary are not usually in contact with the public unless they are assigned to VIP duty or maintaining order during fairs, festivals, athletic events, elections, and natural disasters. They may be sent to quell outbreaks of student or labour unrest, organized crime, and communal riots; to maintain key guard posts, and to participate in anti-terrorism operations. Depending on the assignment, the Provincial Armed Constabulary may only carry lathis.

Senior police officers answer to the police chain of command, and respond to the general direction of designated civilian officials. In the municipal force, the chain of command runs to the state home secretary rather than the district superintendent or district officials.

Recruits receive about 30,000 per month. Opportunities for promotion are limited because of the system of horizontal entry into higher grades. A 2016 article on the Maharashtra state police describes why reform is needed.

Women have entered into the higher echelons of Indian police in greater numbers since the late 1980s, primarily through the Indian Police Service system. Female officers were first used in 1972, and a number of women hold key positions in state police organizations. Their absolute numbers, however, are small. Uniformed and undercover women police officers have been deployed in New Delhi as the Anti-Eve Teasing Squad, which combats the sexual harassment of women (&quot;Eves&quot;). Several women-only police stations have been established in Tamil Nadu to handle sex crimes against women.

===Uniforms===

Uniforms of state and local police vary by grade, region, and type of duty. The main service uniform for state police is khaki. Some cities, such as Kolkata, have white uniforms. Headgear differs by rank and state; officers usually wear a peaked cap, and constables wear berets or sidecaps. Branches such as the Crime Branch, Special Branch do not have a uniform; business dress (shirt, tie, blazer, etc.) is worn with a badge. Special-service armed police have tactical uniforms in accordance with their function, and traffic police generally wear a white uniform.

===Organisation===

The state police is headed by an IPS officer with the rank of director general of police (DGP), assisted by two (or more) additional directors general of police (ADGs). Other DGP rank officers head autonomous bodies not controlled by the DGP, such as the police recruitment board, fire service and police training, vigilance, anti-corruption bureau, prisons department, police housing society, police welfare bureau, etc. State forces are organised into zones, which consist of two (or more) ranges. Important zones are headed by an additional director general of police (ADGP), and other zones are headed by an inspector-general of police (IG). Ranges consist of several districts. Important ranges are headed by an IG, and other ranges are headed by a DIG.

Important districts are headed by a senior superintendent of police (SSP), and other districts are headed by a superintendent of police (SP). If an SSP is heading the district, they are assisted by two (or more) SPs. If an SP is heading the district, they are generally assisted by one or two) Additional SPs. Each district is divided into sub-divisions or circles, under a deputy superintendent of police (DSP). Each sub-division consists of several police stations commanded by an inspector of police, who is assisted by sub-inspectors (SIs) and assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs). In rural areas, a sub-inspector is in charge of a police station; whereas the police circle inspector supervise the functions of the police stations. sub-inspectors (and higher) can file a charge sheet in court.

District SPs are not empowered as executive magistrates. The district magistrate (DM, an IAS officer) exercises these powers, which include promulgating Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and issuing arms licenses.

Other than the district police forces, there can be various other departments under the state police, such as Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Economic Offences Wing (EOW), Telecom, VIP Security, Traffic police, Government Railway Police (GRP), Anti-Corruption Organization, State Armed Police Forces, Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS), Special Task Force (STF), State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB), Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), State Special Branch, Coastal Security Police etc.

==== Government Railway Police ====
The Government Railway Police (GRP) is the security police force that is responsible for policing on the railway stations and trains of Indian Railways. Its duties correspond to those of the District Police in the areas under their jurisdiction, but only on railway property. While Railway Protection Force (RPF) comes under Ministry of Railways, Government of India, GRP comes under the respective state police or UT police.

===Police Commissionerates===

Some major metropolitan cities use the police commissionerate system (like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Jaipur etc.), headed by a police commissioner. Demand for this system is increasing as it gives police a free hand to act freely and take control of any situation. 68 large cities and suburban areas currently have this system in India.

Even during the colonial era, the presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras had commissionerate system.

Reporting to the Police Commissioner (CP) are the Joint Police Commissioner (Joint CPs), Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCPs) and Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACPs). Commissioners of police and their deputies are empowered as executive magistrates to enforce Section 144 of the CrPC and issue arms licenses.

Police commissionerates are subordinate to the state police except for the Kolkata Police, which independently reports to the Department of Home of Government of West Bengal.

===Traffic police===

Highway police and traffic police in small towns are under the state police; traffic police in cities are under the metropolitan and state police.

Traffic police maintain a smooth traffic flow and stop offenders.

Highway police secure the highways and catch speeders. Accidents, registrations, and vehicle data are checked by traffic police.

===State Armed Police Forces===
The State Armed Police Forces provide a state with policing in particularly violent or serious situations, such as combating banditry and Naxalites. Like the Central Armed Police Forces, they are known unofficially as paramilitary forces. Each state police force maintains an armed force, with names such as Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and Special Armed Police, which is responsible for emergencies and crowd control. They are generally activated on orders from a deputy inspector general or higher-level authorities. List of the State Armed Police Forces are here in below.

==State agencies==
In addition to state police forces, there are several other law enforcement agencies under the control of state governments in India. These agencies are specialized in their respective areas of law enforcement. Here are some examples:

===State Excise Departments===
The State Excise Department is responsible for enforcing laws related to the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages and other controlled substances within the state. They regulate and monitor the licensing, taxation, and distribution of such substances. They are responsible for the enforcement of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) and various state laws relating to narcotics.

These departments are primarily focused on implementing and enforcing the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and other relevant laws pertaining to motor vehicles. They are tasked with the enforcement of Motor Vehicles Act and state rules. Each state has its own State Motor Vehicles Department, often headed by a Commissioner of Transport or a similar administrative position.

* Ministry of Transport (Andhra Pradesh)

* Department of Transport (Tamil Nadu)

===Anti-corruption Bureaus (ACBs)===
Vigilance Departments or Anti-Corruption Bureaus are specialized law enforcement agencies under state governments, that are responsible for combating corruption and promoting integrity within the government and public administration. These departments primarily focus on preventing, detecting, and investigating corruption-related offenses involving public officials.

* Anti-Corruption Bureau (Andhra Pradesh)
* Kerala Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB)
* Anti-Corruption Bureau (Maharashtra) (ACB)

== Jurisdiction ==
Police in India primarily belong to the State List of the Constitution and, therefore, Policing and various Police matters falls into the jurisdiction of the respective State Governments.

=== Federal ===

==== Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) ====
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is a premier investigating agency of the Government of India. It derives its power to investigate from the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act (DSPE), 1946. The Jurisdiction of CBI extends across India, but requires prior consent from state governments for investigations within their territories.

Executive officers of the CBI, of the rank of Sub-Inspector and above, are empowered to exercise all the powers of a police officer in charge of a police station for the purpose of investigation in the concerned area.

The CBI can investigate crimes committed against central government employees, such as bribery, corruption, or misconduct. The CBI has the authority to investigate cases with inter-state or international implications, including organized crime, terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering, and other transnational offenses. The CBI can investigate offenses listed in the DSPE Act, such as those under the Prevention of Corruption Act and other central laws. The CBI can also investigate cases referred to it by courts or the central government or the state governments.

The CBI requires the consent of state governments to investigate cases within their territories. This consent can be either general or specific. While general consent allows the CBI to investigate cases without seeking permission for each case, specific consent is required for individual cases. As of 2024, 8 states have withdrawn general consent to the CBI, limiting its ability to freely investigate cases in these states. These states include Punjab, Jharkhand, Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana, Meghalaya, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. 

==== National Investigation Agency (NIA) ====
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is a specialised counter-terrorism law enforcement agency in India. Unlike the CBI, it has nationwide jurisdiction, meaning it can investigate cases across the country without requiring the consent of individual state governments. It functions under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.

The NIA&#x27;s jurisdiction extends to offenses that threaten India&#x27;s sovereignty, security, and integrity, as well as those that impact India&#x27;s relations with other nations. The agency is empowered to investigate various crimes, including terrorism, bomb blasts, aircraft and ship hijackings, human trafficking, counterfeiting, and cyberterrorism. The 2019 amendment to the NIA Act further expanded its jurisdiction to cover a wider range of offenses. 

==== Enforcement Directorate (ED) ====
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is responsible for enforcing economic laws and combating financial crimes. The ED has the power to investigate and prosecute cases related to money laundering, including tracing and attaching assets derived from criminal activities under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The ED enforces Foreign Exchange Management Act and regulations and can investigate and impose penalties for violations of these rules. The ED&#x27;s jurisdiction extends across India and it has powers to investigation and arrest, prosecution, attachment of property and confiscation of property. 

==== Railway Protection Force (RPF) ====
RPF is a security force of Indian Railways that functions under the Ministry of Railways. RPF is primarily responsible for the protection and security of railway property, passengers and passenger areas.

It has the power to search, arrest, enquire, and prosecute offenses committed under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act 1966 and the Railways Act, 1989. The general policing powers on railway stations and trains lie with the respective State&#x27;s Railway Police, known as Government Railway Police (GRP). The GRP has significant powers such as maintaining order, investigating crimes, and preventing crime within the railway stations and trains.

If the RPF encounters a fight or any other criminal activity on a moving train or railway premises, they typically hand over the accused individuals to the GRP for further investigation and legal action. This is because the GRP has primary jurisdiction over general law and order matters within railway premises.

=== State ===
State governments in India have primary jurisdiction over law enforcement, including maintaining law and order, investigating crimes, prosecuting offenders, and managing prisons.

==== State Police ====
Each state in India has its own state police force. At the most basic level, law enforcement is carried out by police stations. These stations are responsible for maintaining law and order, preventing and detecting crimes, and patrolling their designated areas.

The officer in charge of a police station, known as the Station House Officer (SHO), possesses significant powers for maintaining law and order and preventing and detecting crime within the station&#x27;s jurisdictional area.

State police departments often have specialized units like the Crime Branch/CID, ATS, Economic Offences Wing and Cyber Crime Divisions to investigate complex cases that local police may not be equipped to handle. These units are typically activated when investigations require specialized expertise, when local police investigations are insufficient, or when ordered by the government or higher courts. 

==== Anti Corruption Bureaus (ACB) ====
Each state/union territory government possess an agency to investigate and prevent corruption within the public offices. These Anti-Corruption Bureaus are responsible for the enforcement of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and related laws. ACBs have the power to investigate allegations of corruption, conduct raids, arrest suspects, and prosecute offenders. Some states lack dedicated ACBs. In such cases, the Lokayukta&#x27;s investigation wing handles corruption probes.

The Supreme Court and also the Kerala High Court have clarified that State Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureaus (ACBs) have the authority to investigate corruption offenses committed by central government employees. This ruling implies that in cases involving union government officials, the ACB can initiate its own investigation, a power previously exclusive to the CBI. 

==== Special jurisdiction agencies ====
State Excise and Prohibition Departments are responsible for enforcing laws related to narcotics, alcohol, and controlled substances. They enforce the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS). State Forest and Wildlife Departments are tasked with enforcing laws related to forest and wildlife crime management. State Transport Departments/Motor Vehicles Departments are responsible for enforcing the Motor Vehicles Act and its associated rules.

=== Union territory ===
Law enforcement in the union territories of India is primarily handled by the respective Union Territory (UT) Police Forces. These forces are responsible for maintaining law and order, investigating crimes, and ensuring public safety within their jurisdictions.   

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) oversees the UT Police Forces, providing administrative and policy guidance. The Administrator or Lieutenant Governor of each UT exercises executive authority over the police force in their respective territory.

==Role of women==
In 1972, Kiran Bedi became the first female The Law and Order wing of the state police carried out primary law enforcement such as maintaining order, patrolling, crime prevention and detection, etc. For these police stations are constituted,d responsible for routine law enforcement. The police stations has jurisdictionional area, and each headed by a Station House Officer (SHO), who is incharge of the police station. An officer in charge of a police station, often referred to as a Station House Officer (SHO), possesses significant powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). State police departments in India have specialized units to handle specific types of crimes. These units include the Crime Branch/CID for investigating complex crimes, the ATS for investigation of terrorism counter-terrorism, and the EOW for economic offenses. Other specialized units may include Cyber Crime Cell for cybercrimes, and Women&#x27;s Police Stations for crimes against women and children.Indian Police Service officer. Twenty years later, Asha Sinha was the first female commandant of the paramilitary forces. Kanchan Chaudhary Bhattacharya was the first female director general of police in a state when she was appointed DGP of the Uttarakhand Police. In 2018, IPS Officer Archana Ramasundram became the first female paramilitary DGP (Sashastra Seema Bal).
Women had previously been limited to supervisory roles in the Central Armed Police Forces. The parliamentary Committee on Empowerment of Women recommended greater roles for women in the CAPF. In accordance with this recommendation, the Ministry of Home Affairs mandated preferential treatment for women in paramilitary constabularies and later declared that women could be combat officers in all five Central Armed Police Forces. The Union Home Minister announced that female representation in the CRPF and Central Industrial Security Force would be 15 percent and five percent in the Border Security Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police and Sashastra Seema Bal. On 5 January 2016, it was decided that 33 percent of CRPF and CISF constabulary posts would be reserved for women in the CRPF and the CISF, and 14-15 percent in the BSF, SSB and ITBP.

=== Forest Service ===
The maintenance of Forest and Forest land falls within the ambit of respective Forest services of state who is headed by Indian Forest Service (IFoS) Officer. The main mandate of the service is the implementation of the National Forest Policy in order to ensure the ecological stability of the country through the protection and participatory sustainable management of natural resources. An IFoS officer is wholly independent of the district administration and exercises administrative, judicial and financial powers in his own domain. Positions in state forest department, such as District/Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Conservator of Forests (CF), Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) and Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) etc., are held only by IFoS officers. The highest ranking IFS official in each state is the Head of Forest Forces (HoFF). Apart from this Forest are regularly patrolled by Forest Rangers although they don&#x27;t have arrest powers but they are task in detecting and stopping smugglers of Forest produce and poacher. Upon detection the accused/s are handed over to police for further process. The duties of the Forest Service are not confined to stopping of crimes but also have responsibility to develop tourism and also to look after villages falling under Forest land. Forest Services role came to forefront due to smuggling and poaching activities of Verrappan.

There are reports of forest guards being overwhelmed by the animals and poachers and smuggler due to lack of equipment or obsolete equipment. Forest Guards have been reported not able to fight back since they have been under heavy restrictions of usage of weapons and even if available they are no match to automatic weapons employed by the poachers and smugglers.

Although due to nature of the duty Forest guards is a male dominated profession more and more women have been recruited in forest services. This women guards are performing duty akin to their male counterparts. The role of women in Forest service is highlighted in Discovery Channel India&#x27;s four part documentary series &quot;Lion Queens of India&quot; based on forest guards of Gir wildlife sanctuary, Gujarat.

The Forest Department although greatly restricted in carrying firearm, These firearms are only for protection of self and accompanying forest personnels including temporary workers, and the conditions of use of firearms of all descriptions are very rigidly laid out and the use of every cartridge, even for training purposes, has to be immediately accounted for to the department as well as to the Executive Magistrate having jurisdiction and the police. In case of any human casualties arising out of use of these firearms the Executive Magistrate having jurisdiction conducts enquiry and only when he finds that the use of fire arms was unauthorised, illegal, or excessive, further action is taken by the police. Injuries or death of wild animals of all descriptions has to be reported to the Chief Wildlife Warden of the state without delay first over wireless and then in writing. The Forest guards are generally issued .303 Lee Enfield SMLE and 12 Bore double barrel shotgun or single barrel shotgun while under special circumstance L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle are also issued.

The Forest Department are usually travel in Mahindra Jeep or other off-road vehicle, the Forest Department also travel on motorcycles especially Royal Enfield Motorcycles and Hero Splendor.

The Forest guards have uniforms similar to that of police with women also being given option of Salwar kameez. 

==Selection and training==

The recruitment process differs by position, and direct entry (where an applicant does not have to start at the lowest level) is possible. Educational requirements increase for higher posts.

Assistant superintendents of police (ASP) are recruited annually by the independent Union Public Service Commission by competitive examination, and are appointed to the Indian Police Service. The IPS officers are then assigned to a state/union territory police force. Trainee officers undergo 44 weeks of initial training, which includes invited lawyers and management consultants. At the end of their probation, they have several weeks of orientation at the state police academy.

Non-managerial positions are selected by the state (or central) government, and are trained at police recruit schools. The length of training for inspectors is about a year; for constables, it is nearly nine months. School training staff is drawn from the police force. Police are trained in basic law, self-protection, weapons handling and other skills at recruit stations. Superior recruits receive special training.

Recruitment for state police is conducted by state police recruitment boards or state public service commission. Eligibility standards are set by the central government, depending on state demographics.
==Transport==
Unlike other countries, Indian state police forces rely on SUVs. The Mahindra Commander Jeep was the most used car by the police in India until some time ago. This jeep was practical for patrolling rural areas and had a large seating capacity. Now with the arrival of new generation SUVs they are being phased out. SUVs are known for their ability to handle a variety of terrain. Instead of the old Mahindra Jeep, the police are relying on the Mahindra Bolero. Most state police departments in India now use sport utility vehicles like the Mahindra Bolero, Tata Sumo, Maruti Gypsy, Tata Safari, Mahindra Scorpio, Mahindra Thar, etc. In cities, compact utility vehicles (compact SUVs) such as the Mahindra TUV300 and Ford EcoSport, etc. multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) such as the Toyota Innova and Maruti Suzuki Ertiga, and sedans such as the Toyota Etios and Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire are used. In some states, like Kerala, vehicles such as the Force Gurkha, the Isuzu DMax, the Mitsubishi Pajero, etc. are used for special purposes.

Minivans are used by police in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Lucknow where the Chevrolet Tavera (Delhi, Kochi, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram), Toyota Qualis (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai) and Maruti Suzuki Ertiga (Bangalore, Lucknow and Pune) are extensively used. Although most cities use SUVs and minivans, Chennai has adopted sedans such as the Hyundai Accent; Kolkata has adopted the Tata Indigo. In Kerala cities such as Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode, the Pink Police Patrol (to protect women) uses the Toyota Etios, Maruti Suzuki Swift DZire, Volkswagen Vento and Police Control Room Units uses Mahindra TUV and new gen Mahindra Thar as first responding vehicle. Mumbai Police and Lucknow Police use Mahindra TUV for Pink Police.

Depending upon the state, police vehicles may have revolving lights, strobes, or light bars and public announcement systems, surveillance cameras. A modernization drive has ensured that vehicles are equipped with two-way radios in communication with a central control room. Highway police vehicles generally have radar equipment, breath analyzers, and emergency first aid kits. For traffic regulation and city patrol, motorcycles are also used; most was the Indian version of the Royal Enfield Bullet, but the Bajaj Pulsar and TVS Apache are also used.

== Weapons and equipment ==

Weapons and equipment vary from state to state and agency to agency. Standard equipment for a constable on the beat is the lathi, or long baton—generally made of bamboo, but currently also made of polymer. Riot police have other equipment, including tear gas and tasers.

Although police constables do not generally carry firearms on regular duty, they are available at police stations. Officers at and above the rank of sub-inspector or head constable are authorized to carry a side arm, generally a Pistol Auto 9mm 1A or a Glock 17. Officers always carry side arms. Traffic police officers have fine books and other equipment.

Firearms previously stocked at police stations included .303 Lee–Enfield rifles (now replaced), 7.62 1A self-loading rifles and SAF Carbine 2A1s, which have been replaced by AK-47 and INSAS rifles. The Ordnance Factory Board is a supplier of arms, ammunition, uniforms, bullet-proof vehicles, and mine-protected vehicles to the police. Only a station officer can allow the use of reserve guns in emergencies. During public unrest, protests or possible terrorist attacks, police are equipped by the state (or central) government.

Special units at the state and federal level have automatic weapons, such as the AK-47, AKM and INSAS assault rifles and Bren guns. Special-forces and SWAT units use Heckler &amp; Koch MP5s, Brügger &amp; Thomet MP9s, AK-103s, M4A1 Carbines and others. Bulletproof jackets are generally not worn by state police, although special units carry tactical vests, gear, and weapons according to function.


== Special units ==

* CoBRA - The &quot;Commando Battalion for Resolute Action,&quot; abbreviated &quot;as&quot; CoBRA&quot;,&quot; is a specialized force under the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). It is tasked with combating left-wing extremism and insurgents, primarily engaged in jungle warfare operations.
*
* Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) - Anti-Terrorism Squads (ATS) are specialized units of state police forces tasked with combating terrorism, handling counter-terror operations, and investigating terrorism-related crimes. Maharashtra State Police was the first police department in the country to set up an ATS unit. Each ATS unit collaborates with central agencies like the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) to handle threats and ensure national security.

==&quot;Mukhbir&quot;==
Informers (&quot;mukhbir&quot;) provide information for financial compensation. Police agencies budget for their &quot;mukhbir&quot;s because they are &quot;the eyes and ears of police&quot;, and help resolve cases. In 2012, the Delhi Police budgeted 40 lakh ( 4 million) to pay their &quot;mukhbir&quot; ( 2,000 per inspector). 

== Police reform in India ==

The Police in India, primarily governed by the colonial-era Police Act of 1861, has long been criticized for its subservience to the executive and lack of accountability. While some states have enacted their own police acts post-independence, such as the Bombay Police Act of 1951, the Kerala Police Act of 1960, the Karnataka Police Act of 1963, and the Delhi Police Act of 1978, the core issues of police accountability and public trust remain largely unaddressed.
The landmark judgment in Prakash Singh v. Union of India marked a significant step towards police reforms in India. The Supreme Court issued several directives to the Central and State Governments to improve the efficiency and accountability of the police force. Following are the key directives of the SC;
* State Security Commission (SSC)
**Establishment of a State Security Commission to ensure the independence of the police and prevent undue political interference.
**The Commission should be modeled after recommendations from the National Human Rights Commission, Reberio Committee, or Sorabjee Committee.
*Selection and Tenure of DGP:
** Selection of the Director General of Police (DGP) from among the three most senior officers empanelled by the Union Public Service Commission.
** A minimum tenure of two years for the DGP, irrespective of their date of superannuation.
*Tenure of Operational Police Officers:
**A minimum tenure of two years for police officers on operational duties, such as Inspectors General (IGPs) incharge of police zones, Deputy Inspectors General (DIGs) incharge of police ranges, Superintendents of Police (SPs) incharge of police districts, and Station House Officers (SHOs) incharge of police stations.
*Separation of Investigation and Law and Order:
**Separation of investigative and law and order functions of police at the police station level.

*Police Establishment Board:
**Establishment of a Police Establishment Board at the State level to handle transfers, postings, promotions, and other service-related matters of officers up to the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police.

*Police Complaint Authority
**Establishment of Police Complaints Authorities at the State and District levels to investigate complaints against police officers.

*National Security Commission:
**Establishment of a National Security Commission at the Union level to select and place chiefs of Central Police Organizations (CPOs) and ensure their minimum tenure of two years.
==Public perception==
In general, police in India lack public trust and are not viewed as legitimate authorities. People generally do not go to the police for help if given the choice, and often specifically take pains to avoid them. Oftentimes, when people do go to the police, it is &quot;only for instrumental purposes, such as obtaining a First Information Report (FIR) as documentary evidence to be used to achieve some end&quot;. People expect the police be unhelpful at best, and corrupt or brutal &quot;little tyrants&quot; at worst. Former Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram characterised the police constable as &quot;the most reviled public servant in India.&quot; Even police officers themselves often lack faith in the institution, as illustrated by an apocryphal story popular among officers where &quot;a self-styled &#x27;honest cop&#x27;&quot; asks a group of fellow officers if they would trust their coworkers to take care of a family member in trouble — to which none of them said yes.

Scholars usually tend to attribute the police&#x27;s poor reputation in India to two main factors. First, the police as an institution in India was first developed by the British as an instrument of control. The 1861 Police Act, which remains &quot;the institutional bedrock across the country&quot;, configured the police to focus less on public service and crime investigation, and more on &quot;coercive order keeping and crowd pacification&quot;. Second, the police in postcolonial India are affected by the same corruption and abuse of power that has plagued the government in general. Police have historically been known to apply excessive force, extortion, and arbitrary and often discriminatory use of authority.

<text>Douglas Moench (; born February 23, 1948) is an American comic book writer notable for his &quot;Batman&quot; work and as the creator of Moon Knight, Deathlok, Black Mask, Harvey Bullock, &quot;Electric Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Six from Sirius&quot;. He is also known for his critically acclaimed eight-year run on &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Moench has written novels, short stories, newspaper feature articles, weekly newspaper comic strips, film screenplays and teleplays. His first published work was &quot;My Dog Sandy&quot;, a comic strip printed in his elementary school newspaper. Moench had a fan letter printed in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; issue #17 (Oct. 1964) in which he praised the art of Steve Ditko and others printed in &quot;Avengers&quot; #51 (April 1968), &quot;Captain America&quot; #102 (June 1968), and &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #14 (March 1970). He began his professional writing career with scripts for &quot;Eerie&quot; #29 and &quot;Vampirella&quot; #7 (both cover dated September 1970) and articles for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. In 1973, he moved to New York City.

==Career==
Moench began working for Marvel Comics in 1973, with his first story for the company appearing in &quot;Chamber of Chills&quot; #7 (November 1973). The following year, Moench became the &quot;de facto&quot; lead writer for the Marvel black-and-white magazine imprint Curtis Magazines. He contributed to the entire runs of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Doc Savage&quot;, while serving as a regular scribe for virtually every other Curtis title during the course of the imprint&#x27;s existence. For Marvel&#x27;s color comic line, Moench wrote the &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; title and followed Steve Englehart as writer of &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot;. Moench scripted the &quot;Deathlok&quot; feature in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; featuring the character co-created by Rich Buckler. Moench and artist Don Perlin introduced Moon Knight in &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; #32 (August 1975). The character of Moon Knight would then go on to be featured in other Marvel titles eventually getting his own solo series in 1980. Moench and George Pérez launched &quot;The Inhumans&quot; series in October 1975 while &quot;Weirdworld&quot; was created by Moench and Mike Ploog in &quot;Marvel Super Action&quot; #1 (January 1976).

Continuing his work for the black-and white magazine line, Moench and Walt Simonson debuted &quot;The Rampaging Hulk&quot; in January 1977. The series was retitled &quot;The Hulk!&quot; with issue #10 and switched to a full-color format. Two licensed properties which Moench worked on with Herb Trimpe were &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Shogun Warriors&quot;.

Moench is a frequent and longtime collaborator with comics artist Paul Gulacy. The pair are probably best known for their work on &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot;, which they worked on together from 1974 to 1977. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that &quot;Ingenious writing by Doug Moench and energetic art by Paul Gulacy brought &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot; new life.&quot; In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Moench and Gulacy&#x27;s work on &quot;Master of Kung-Fu&quot; sixth on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;. Moench and Gulacy later co-created &quot;Six from Sirius&quot;, &quot;Slash Maraud&quot;, and &quot;S.C.I. Spy&quot;, and have worked together on comics projects featuring Batman, Conan the Barbarian and James Bond.

In late August 1982, Moench left Marvel due to disagreements with then editor-in-chief Jim Shooter. He was hired by DC, and from 1983 to 1986 he wrote &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. He co-created new villains including Nightslayer in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #529 (Aug. 1983) Black Mask in &quot;Batman&quot; #386 (Aug. 1985), and the Film Freak in &quot;Batman&quot; #395 (May 1986). He and artist Don Newton produced the story in which Jason Todd replaces Dick Grayson as Robin in &quot;Batman&quot; #368 (February 1984). His first run on the title ended with issue #400 which featured work by several popular comics artists and included an introduction by novelist Stephen King. In his second run on the title from 1992 to 1998, Moench was one of the writers of the &quot;&quot; storyline and wrote &quot;Batman&quot; #500 in which the character Azrael replaced Bruce Wayne as Batman. The &quot;KnightsEnd&quot; arc which saw the return of Bruce Wayne to the role of Batman was co-written by Moench as well. Other Batman storylines which Moench contributed to include &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Working at DC Comics in the 1980s, Moench wrote &quot;Omega Men&quot; and &quot;The Spectre&quot;. He was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series in 1986 and co-created &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; with artist Jim Baikie; &quot;Lords of the Ultra-Realm&quot; with Pat Broderick; and &quot;Slash Maraud&quot; with Gulacy.

Moench has frequently been paired with the artist and inker team of Kelley Jones and John Beatty on several Elseworlds graphic novels, including &quot;Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain&quot; and a long run of the monthly &quot;Batman&quot; comic. In 1994, Moench co-wrote the &quot;Batman-Spawn: War Devil&quot; intercompany crossover with Chuck Dixon and Alan Grant.

==Personal life==
Moench and his wife, Debra, have a son, Derek. As of 2018, Moench lives in Pennsylvania.

==Non-comics bibliography (selected)==
Moench wrote book, movie, and music reviews for &quot;Fling&quot;, and he wrote for several other men&#x27;s magazines, including &quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;Cavalier&quot;, &quot;Knight&quot;, &quot;Man to Man&quot; and &quot;Swingle&quot;. He wrote several articles for &quot;Midwest&quot;, the Sunday magazine of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. For the never-published &quot;WLS Generation&quot;, he interviewed The Who, The Monkees, and The Seeds. Moench wrote an article called &quot;23 on the 23rd&quot; a true story about his own 23rd birthday.

*&quot;Batman Masters Collection&quot; – Set of 120 trading cards, with front art by artists Scott Hampton, Carl Critchlow, Duncan Fegredo, and Dermot Power. The flip sides of the first 90 cards, when read in order, form a storyline in which Batman fakes his own death. The set provides a look at the posthumous feelings of the residents of Gotham City and Arkham Asylum towards the Dark Knight. A special collector&#x27;s binder was released for the card set. This card set was reprinted as a 208-page coffeetable book entitled &quot;Batman Masterpieces&quot;. It contains full-page reproductions of the card art opposite the card&#x27;s text (so one can still follow the story), art concepts (instructions to the artists) and comments by the artist. Additionally, early sketches have been printed for most of the cards.
*&quot;Batgirl: To Dare the Darkness&quot; – A young-reader novel that was released with the marketing blitz for the &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; movie, set immediately after the events of the film.
*&quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; – Teleplay for one episode.
*&quot;Double Dragon&quot; – Series bible for the cartoon released by DiC Entertainment.
*&quot;The Forensic Files of Batman&quot; – A short story collection about how Batman uses clues found at crime scenes to foil the plans of his most famous villains. Each chapter is a different case presented from the notes, journals, and case files of the Batman, Bruce Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth, and Jim Gordon.
*&quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; – Story editor and head writer for the 1980s animated series.
*&quot;Red Sonja&quot; – Original screenplay for the Red Sonja movie. The movie was later rewritten and changed quite a bit from Moench&#x27;s version.

<doc id="817445" wikidata="Q1141470" url="?curid=817445" title="Double act">
<text>A double act (also known as a comedy duo) is a form of comedy originating in the British music hall tradition, and American vaudeville, in which two comedians perform together as a single act, often highlighting differences in their characters&#x27; personalities. Pairings are typically long-term, in some cases for the artists&#x27; entire careers. Double acts perform on the stage, television and film.

The format is particularly popular in the UK where successful acts have included Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (Cook&#x27;s deadpan delivery contrasted with Moore&#x27;s buffoonery), Flanagan and Allen, Morecambe and Wise, &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, and French and Saunders. The tradition is also present in the US with acts like Wheeler and Woolsey, Abbott and Costello, Gallagher and Shean, Burns and Allen, and Lyons and Yosco. The British-American comedy double act Laurel and Hardy has been described as the most popular in the world.

==Format==
Humor is often derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin, and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior; each one serves as a foil to the other. Typically, one member of the duo—the &quot;straight man&quot;, &quot;feed&quot;, &quot;dead wood&quot;, or stooge—is often portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other one—the funny man, &quot;banana man&quot;, or comic—is portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox, although there are also double acts in which neither partner is the straight man
 When the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other is often referred to as a comic foil. The term &quot;feed&quot; comes from the way a straight man sets up jokes and then &quot;feeds&quot; them to his partner.

Despite the names often given to the roles, the straight man is not always humorless, nor is it always the comic who provides the act&#x27;s humor. Sometimes the straight man gets laughs through sarcastic reactions to the comic&#x27;s antics, such as Stewart Lee&#x27;s deadpan, reasoned reactions to Richard Herring&#x27;s ridiculous antics in their pairing. When the straight man serves no specific comic purpose, but acts as a device to make the comic look good, he is known as a stooge. Sometimes considered a derogatory term, &quot;stooge&quot; began to fall out of use by the 1930s with The Three Stooges. Most often the humor in a double act comes from the way the two personalities play off of each other, rather than from the individual players. In many successful acts the roles are interchangeable.

==History==

===Early development===

The model for the modern double act began in the British music halls and the American vaudeville scene of the late 19th century. Here, the straight man was needed to repeat the lines of the comic because audiences were noisy. A dynamic soon developed in which the straight man was a more integral part of the act, setting up jokes for the comic to deliver a punch line. Popular draws included acts like George Burns and Gracie Allen (who initially operated with Burns as the comic but quickly switched roles when Gracie&#x27;s greater appeal was recognized), Abbott and Costello, Flanagan and Allen, Gallagher and Shean, Smith and Dale, and Lyons and Yosco. The dynamic evolved, with Abbott and Costello using a modern and recognizable formula in routines such as Who&#x27;s on First? in the 1930s and Flanagan and Allen using &quot;cross talking&quot;.

Though vaudeville lasted into the 1930s, its popularity waned because of the rise of motion pictures. Some failed to survive the transition to movies and disappeared. By the 1920s, double acts were beginning to attract worldwide fame more readily through the silent era. The comedy was not derived from &quot;cross-talk&quot; or clever verbal exchanges, but through slapstick routines and the actions of the characters.

The first double act to gain worldwide fame through film was the Danish duo Ole &amp; Axel, who made their first film together in 1921. The latter half of the same decade introduced to the world the inimitable team of Laurel and Hardy. The pair had never worked together on stage (they did as of 1940), though both had worked in vaudeville—Stan Laurel with Charlie Chaplin as part of Fred Karno&#x27;s Army and Oliver Hardy as a singer. Laurel could loosely be described as the comic, though the pair were one of the first not to fit the mold in the way that many double acts do, with both taking a fairly equal share of the laughs. The pair first worked together as a double act in the 1927 film &quot;Duck Soup&quot;. The first Laurel and Hardy film was called &quot;Putting Pants on Philip&quot; though their familiar characters had not yet been established. The first film they both appeared in was &quot;Lucky Dog&quot; in 1921. Laurel and Hardy adapted well to silent films, both being skilled at slapstick, and their nonverbal interplay with each other and the audience became famous—Laurel&#x27;s cry and Hardy&#x27;s downtrodden glances to the camera whenever something went wrong—and were carried over to their later talkies. They were one of the few silent acts who made a successful transition to spoken word pictures in the 1930s, showing themselves to be equally adept at verbal wordplay.

===1940s–1960s===
In 1940 was the release of Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Saps at Sea&quot;, their final film for long-term producer and collaborator Hal Roach. Later their popularity declined. In 1940s America the double act remained a cinema draw, developing into the &quot;buddy movie&quot; genre, with Abbott and Costello making the transition from stage to screen and the first of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Road to...&quot; series in 1940. Further acts followed. For example, the first pairing of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis occurred in 1946. About the same time The Bickersons became popular on radio. Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner started their 2000 Year Old Man recordings and subsequent television appearances in 1961. The genre has continued to exist in cinema while making a successful transition to radio and later TV via The Smothers Brothers and &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh In&quot;.

In Britain, double acts were confined to theatres and radio until the late 1950s, when double acts such as Morecambe and Wise and Mike and Bernie Winters slowly began the transition to TV on variety shows such as &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. These acts came into their own in the mid- to late-1960s. When Morecambe and Wise teamed up with writer Eddie Braben, they began to redefine what was meant by a double act, with Wise, the straight man, being developed into a comic character in his own right. They provided the link between music hall and modern comedy for double acts. As the two leading double acts of the day, Morecambe and Wise and the Winters brothers enjoyed a playful rivalry—the Winters mocked the slight edge Morecambe and Wise had over them in popularity, while Morecambe, when asked what he and Wise would have been if not comedians, replied &quot;Mike and Bernie Winters&quot;.

A series of black-and-white films based on Don Camillo and Peppone characters created by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French-Italian coproductions, and starred Fernandel as the Italian priest Don Camillo and Gino Cervi as Giuseppe &#x27;Peppone&#x27; Bottazzi, the Communist Mayor of their rural town. The titles are: &quot;The Little World of Don Camillo&quot; (1952), &quot;The Return of Don Camillo&quot; (1953), &quot;Don Camillo&#x27;s Last Round&quot; (1955), &quot;Don Camillo: Monsignor&quot; (1961), and &quot;Don Camillo in Moscow&quot; (1965). The movies were a huge commercial success in their native countries. In 1952, &quot;Little World of Don Camillo&quot; became the highest-grossing film in both Italy and France, while &quot;The Return of Don Camillo&quot; was the second most popular film of 1953 at the Italian and French box office.
Franco and Ciccio were a comedy duo formed by Italian actors Franco Franchi (1928–1992) and Ciccio Ingrassia (1922–2003), particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Their collaboration began in 1954 in the theater field, and ended with Franchi&#x27;s death in 1992. The two made their cinema debuts in 1960 with the film &quot;Appuntamento a Ischia&quot;. They remained active until 1984 when their last film together, &quot;Kaos&quot;, was shot, although there were some interruptions in 1973 and from 1975 to 1980. Together, they appeared in 112 films. They acted in films certainly made in a short time and with few means, such as those shot with director Marcello Ciorciolini, sometimes even making a dozen films in a year, often without a real script and where they often improvised on the set. Also are the 13 films directed by Lucio Fulci, who was the architect of the reversal of their typical roles by making Ciccio the serious one, the sidekick, and Franco the comic one. They also worked with important directors such as Pier Paolo Pasolini and the Taviani brothers. Considered at the time as protagonists of B movie, they were subsequently reevaluated by critics for their comedy and creative abilities, becoming the subject of study. The huge success with the public is evidenced by the box office earnings, which in the 1960s, represented 10% of the annual earnings in Italy.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the traditional formula was shunned by The Two Ronnies, who completely dispensed with the need for a straight man, and Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, two Oxbridge-educated comedians who used the double act to deliver satire and edgy comedy.

===1970s===

Internationally the most popular double act of the 1970s was the Italian duo Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. The team had already made three straight westerns together during the 1960s but turned their act towards slapstick in their fourth (&quot;They Call Me Trinity&quot;, 1970), with massive success.

Light entertainment in Britain in the 1970s was dominated by Morecambe and Wise, who enjoyed impressive ratings, especially on their Christmas specials. Although Mike and Bernie Winters&#x27;s popularity declined, The Two Ronnies&#x27; success grew while Peter Cook and Dudley Moore sporadically produced acclaimed work, in particular, their controversial recordings as Derek and Clive from 1976 to 1978.

The mid-to-late 1970s saw a resurgence in American double acts. &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974) featured a memorable performance by Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman (who later teamed up again in Brooks&#x27;s 1981 follow-up &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;). &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, first broadcast in 1975, provided an outlet for comedians to appear in sketches as double acts and continues to do so. It was here that Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi honed their characters The Blues Brothers, who were soon pulled to fame in the 1980 buddy movie of the same name. Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor also embarked on a string of successful buddy films in the 1970s. Cheech &amp; Chong also gained massive popularity during this time.

Occasionally, the straight-man/funny-man dynamic appeared in unexpected contexts between characters not normally thought of as comics. This often appeared in the James T. Kirk (William Shatner)/Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) relationship in several episodes of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

===1980s===

Morecambe and Wise had dominated British light entertainment throughout the 1970s, but their presence waned in the early 1980s. When Morecambe died moments after finishing a solo show in 1984 (his last words were &#x27;I&#x27;m glad that&#x27;s over&#x27;), the best-loved double act in British comedy came to an end, and several new acts emerged. The two distinct groups could not have been more different.

In the wake of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, &quot;The Young Ones&quot; and the breakthrough onto television of &quot;alternative comedy&quot; came French and Saunders; Fry and Laurie; Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson; Hale and Pace; and Smith and Jones. These edgier comics were brasher and crude—comedy&#x27;s answer to punk rock. They developed the satire and vulgarity of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore rather than the more gentle humour of Morecambe and Wise and The Two Ronnies. In fact, Smith and Jones showed blatant disregard for their predecessors, openly mocking the Two Ronnies (this may have been a factor in Ronnie Barker&#x27;s decision to retire from comedy in the late 1980s).

===1990s–present day===
The early 1990s saw comedy become &quot;the new rock and roll&quot; in Britain and this was inherent in the work of Newman and Baddiel and Punt and Dennis on &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;. Newman and Baddiel, in particular, symbolized this rock and roll attitude by playing the biggest ever British comedy gig at Wembley Arena. With this came tension. Newman and Baddiel fell out with Punt and Dennis, not wishing to share screen time with them, and then with each other. David Baddiel went on to form another successful double act with Frank Skinner.

The 1990s also saw the introduction of one of comedy&#x27;s strangest yet most successful double acts in Reeves and Mortimer. They at the same time deconstructed light entertainment and paid homage to many of the classic double acts (Vic Reeves would even do an Eric Morecambe impression on &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;). They simultaneously used very bizarre, idiosyncratic humour and traditional double act staples (in later years they became increasingly reliant on violent slapstick).

Another double act that emerged in the mid to late 1990s was Lee &amp; Herring, who combined a classic clash of personalities (downbeat and rational Lee contrasting with energetic, childish Herring) with very ironic, often satirical humour.

Also appearing in the latter half of the decade were Adam and Joe, whose low-budget, self-produced Channel 4 series &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot; was a very sharp combination of TV and movie parodies and satirical looks at various elements of youth culture.

Indian cinema also had its share of the double act, with Tamil cinema comedians Goundamani and Senthil teaming up for several films throughout the decade, similarly Kota Srinivasa Rao and Babu Mohan in Telugu cinema.

The British duo Mitchell and Webb are another successful double act from the 2000s onwards, having multiple sketch shows on both radio and TV as well as starring in the award-winning sitcom &quot;Peep Show&quot;.

For over 20 years, Australians Hamish Blake and Andy Lee have worked together as Hamish &amp; Andy, having multiple successful TV shows and a very popular radio show and podcast.

Most of the most successful double acts in the early 2000s take their inspiration from the odder strain of double-act comedy spearheaded by Reeves and Mortimer. Matt Lucas and David Walliams, who had previously worked with Reeves and Mortimer, also took inspiration from the Two Ronnies. The Mighty Boosh also played with the formula but essentially remained traditional at their roots. Another popular current light entertainment/presenting comedy act is Ant &amp; Dec, who are a very basic yet effective example of a double act.

In early 2012, comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele appeared in a sketch comedy TV show titled &quot;Key &amp; Peele&quot; airing on Comedy Central.

Many modern-day YouTube channels follow this format. Some examples include Smosh, Dan and Phil, the Game Grumps, and Rhett and Link of the YouTube channel Good Mythical Morning,

==United Kingdom==
In its British form, the two actors would usually be composed of a &quot;straight man&quot; or &quot;feed&quot; and a &quot;comic&quot;, the purpose of the feed is to set up jokes for the comic. This would rely heavily on comic timing.

Morecambe and Wise are arguably the quintessential British double act. They followed the traditional formula with Eric Morecambe as the comic and Ernie Wise as the feed. Other British acts such as The Two Ronnies, Hale and Pace, Vic and Bob, French and Saunders, Mitchell and Webb, Fry and Laurie, Ant &amp; Dec, Punt and Dennis, Lee and Herring, Armstrong and Miller, Peacock and Gamble and Dick and Dom display the role of &quot;comic&quot; and &quot;straight man&quot; in a less obvious, largely interchangeable way or are dispensed with altogether. More obvious British examples of the comic-feed dynamic are Cannon and Ball, Little and Large or the children&#x27;s entertainers The Chuckle Brothers, where the straight man acted largely as a humourless set up for the comic.
Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were perhaps the first double act to go against the grain as turned their double act into a complex analysis of their relationship. In many of the sketches (especially the Pete and Dud exchanges) Cook played the domineering know-it-all (who knows nothing) and Moore the put-upon dimwit (who also knows nothing).

This dominance was accentuated by the difference in height between the two, and the speed of Cook&#x27;s mind, which meant that he could ad lib and force Moore to corpse in a Pete and Dud dialogue, leaving him helpless to respond. As the partnership progressed into the often-improvised Derek and Clive dialogues, these light-hearted attempts to make Moore laugh became, as a result of Cook&#x27;s growing insecurity and alcoholism, aggressive attacks on the defenseless Moore. Carrying the tradition of going against the grain of traditional double acts, when the partnership dissolved in the late 1970s, it was Cook whose career stalled due to boredom, alcoholism and lack of ambition, while Moore went on to become one of Hollywood&#x27;s most unlikely leading men.

===Sitcoms===
The double act has become a popular theme in British sitcoms. One of the earliest examples of this was the relationship between Tony Hancock and Sid James in the Galton and Simpson series &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. James played a down-to-earth character while Hancock was pompous and had delusions of grandeur, and the comedy was derived from the two playing off each other&#x27;s characteristics.

A common trend in sitcoms is to place the double act in a situation where they are forced together through uncontrollable circumstance. In another Galton and Simpson production, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, a son, with great ambition, was forced to live with his elderly, manipulative father as a rag and bone man. The comedy derives from the way the characters interact in their tempestuous relationship. The series also has more heart-rending moments as the son despairs at his inability to escape his needy, selfish, grasping father.

&quot;Porridge&quot; saw &quot;an habitual criminal&quot;, Fletcher (played by Ronnie Barker, already famous for his comedy partnership with Ronnie Corbett) and a young, naive, first-time prisoner, Lennie Godber. The two would bicker but endured a relationship of mutual respect. Barker also formed a partnership with David Jason in &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, with Jason playing Granville while Barker played Albert Arkwright. Many don&#x27;t see this as a comedy duo, but the straight-man element coupled with Barker&#x27;s funny-man antics on the show are still compressed into the script.

Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson combined their success in sitcoms (&quot;The Young Ones&quot;) and as a double act (The Dangerous Brothers) in 1991 when they created &quot;Bottom&quot;. Their characters are a pair of sad, pathetic losers forced together by their mutual hopelessness. However, unlike earlier examples of such, the characters in &quot;Bottom&quot; absolutely hate each other, exacerbating their despair. This often leads to slapstick violence, such as hitting each other with frying pans. Mayall and Edmonson have said &quot;Bottom&quot; aimed to be more than just a series of toilet gags—it was meant to be a cruder cousin to plays like &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; about the pointlessness of life.

Other popular double acts in British sitcoms include complex relationships involving status and superiority themes: in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, the social climbing envy of Captain George Mainwaring, to his right-hand man (Sergeant Arthur Wilson) who is of higher status than him; and in Red Dwarf, the working class everyman Dave Lister to the middle class but socially-awkward Arnold Rimmer. However, the most prominent double act is that of an intelligent person and his inferior sidekick, such as Basil and Manuel of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, Blackadder and Baldrick of &quot;Blackadder&quot;, or Ted and Father Dougal of the Irish sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;.

In recent years, double acts as sitcoms appear to have gone full circle, as illustrated by the cult success of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;. For the relationship between the two main characters this series uses a formula very similar to that between Sid and Tony in &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; – that of an arrogant character whose best friend can see his faults and keeps him grounded. A similar dynamic is used in &quot;Peep Show&quot; in which the characters of Mitchell and Webb were adapted for the sitcom formula. In this case both characters have a degree of egotism. The difference between the pair is the free-spirited, uneducated and selfishness of Jeremy and the intellectual arrogance but shyness of Mark.

==U.S. and Canada==
In the United States and Canada, the tradition was more popular in the earlier part of the 20th century with vaudeville-derived acts such as Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Burns and Allen, Jackie Gleason and Art Carney, Wheeler &amp; Woolsey, and Lyons and Yosco and continuing into the television age with Martin and Lewis, Kenan &amp; Kel, Bob and Ray, the Smothers Brothers, Wayne and Shuster, Allen and Rossi, Jack Burns and Avery Schreiber, Rowan and Martin, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, the Wayans Brothers, Stewie Griffin and Brian Griffin from &quot;Family Guy&quot; and Shawn and Gus in &quot;Psych&quot;. The series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; was known for its double acts, and Lucille Ball served as foil to both her husband Desi Arnaz and to Vivian Vance. Vance could also serve as foil to William Frawley when the situation required. Vance and Ball would again serve as a double act in their next series &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. More recently, the model has been largely supplanted by that of the &quot;buddy movie&quot; genre, which has introduced several notable comedy partnerships not formally billed as a single &quot;act&quot; in the traditional manner. The earliest example of such a team may have been Bob Hope and Bing Crosby; later examples include Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, David Spade and Chris Farley and child stars Drake Bell and Josh Peck. Based on the gag-man/straight-man concept, &quot;Stoner&quot; duos like Cheech &amp; Chong, Jay &amp; Silent Bob, and Harold &amp; Kumar have also proven quite popular with audiences. The double act format can also be used in presenting noncomedic information in an entertaining manner, such as Savage/Hyneman pair of the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;MythBusters&quot; (which Savage stated was unintentional when they began the series but naturally grew into a double act as the result of their own conflicting personalities). From 2006 to 2010, Apple used the double-act formula successfully in its popular series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Mac/And I&#x27;m a PC&quot; ads with John Hodgman and Justin Long.

==Italy==


In Italy the tradition was more popular in the late part of the 20th century with Battaglia &amp; Miseferi, Cochi e Renato, Ficarra e Picone, Fichi d&#x27;India, Gigi e Andrea, Katia &amp; Valeria, Lillo &amp; Greg, Pio e Amedeo, and Ric e Gian. Cochi e Renato were childhood friends, and they grew accustomed to perform together in front of an audience of friends and relatives. Their professional debut took place in 1965 in the small cabaret club Cab 64 in Milan, where they performed along with Lino Toffolo and Bruno Lauzi. They were also joined by Enzo Jannacci and Felice Andreasi with whom they formed the comedy ensemble Motore, who had a good success in Milan. The couple became first known in the late 1960s thanks to the RAI innovative variety shows &quot;Quelli della domenica&quot; (1968) and &quot;È domenica, ma senza impegno&quot; (1969). Characterized by a peculiar comic verve, filled with paradoxical and surreal moods, their popularity increased in the early 1970s with the variety show &quot;Il poeta e il contadino&quot; and with the participation with the musical show &quot;Canzonissima&quot;. The couple began to crack in 1974, when Renato started devoting himself to a full-time film career. After a long separation, Cochi e Renato reunited in 2000s for a series of television and stage projects. Cochi e Renato were also very active as singer-songwriters (often with the collaboration of Enzo Jannacci), and they had several commercial hits; their most successful song is &quot;E la vita la vita&quot;, which reached the first place at the Italian charts in 1974.

Ric e Gian met in an avanspettacolo at the Teatro Maffei in Turin, where Ric worked as a dancer and Gian was the sidekick of the actor Mario Ferrero. They then decided to performing together as &quot;Jerry e Fabio&quot; and worked in various theaters, nights and cabarets in Northern Italy as well as at the Crazy Horse in Paris. Noted by film producer Angelo Rizzoli, they renamed themselves Ric e Gian in 1962 and made their film debut in &quot;Ischia operazione amore&quot; (1966). Starting from the late 1960s, the couple gained popularity thanks to their participation in several prime time RAI variety shows. In the mid-1970s they focused on theatre, and between late 1970s and early 1980s their popularity revamped thanks to a number of Antenna 3 and Fininvest television shows they took part in. In 1987 the couple split to pursue some solo projects, before briefly reuniting between 2002 and 2006 for a number of stage shows and plays.

Gigi e Andrea started performing together in small theaters, cabarets and hostelries in Bologna in the second half of the 1970s. They debuted in 1978 on the Rai 1 variety show &quot;Io e la Befana&quot;. The year before they had appeared for the first time on TV in &quot;A modo mio&quot;, directed by Memo Remigi. In the 1980s, the couple starred and co-starred in several comedy films which were usually badly received by critics but of commercial success. The same period, their presence on the small screen also became more intense, especially on Fininvest variety shows and television films. In the 1990s, having reached a more than respectable success, the couple split in order to pursue solo projects.

Ficarra e Picone started in 1993 along with Salvatore Borrello as a comedy trio, performing together on stage as &quot;Chiamata Urbana Urgente&quot;. In 1998, the two remaining members began to use their surnames: Ficarra &amp; Picone. In 2000, Ficarra e Picone made their film debut with &quot;Ask Me If I&#x27;m Happy&quot; by Aldo, Giovanni &amp; Giacomo, and two years later they made the first film as main actors, &quot;Nati stanchi&quot;. On 25 April 2005, Ficarra and Picone were the TV anchor-men four episodes of &quot;Striscia la notizia&quot; to which they collaborated from 27 March 2006 up to 5 December 2020. In 2007 they debuted as directors alongside Gianbattista Avellino with the film &quot;Il 7 e l&#x27;8&quot;, for which they were nominated to David di Donatello for Best New Director and to Silver Ribbon in the same category. Also in 2007 they were featured as comic characters in the story &quot;Zio Paperone e il rapimento teatrale&quot; (trad. &quot;Uncle Scrooge and the Theatrical Kidnapping&quot;), published in the issue 2678 of &quot;Topolino&quot;.

==China==

In China, xiangsheng (also known as crosstalk) is a traditional comedic performance usually in the form of a dialogue between two performers.

==Japan==

In Japan the manzai tradition parallels that of the double although it is more formulaic. Here there is a distinguished straight man (&quot;tsukkomi&quot;) and funny man (&quot;boke&quot;) and the humor consists of quick slapstick jokes, comical stories and social misunderstandings.

==Germany==
In Germany Tünnes and Schäl (since 1803/1850s), two Cologne puppet theater characters, fit to the concept of fool and straight man.

During WWII Tran and Helle appeared in a number of short films to deter Germans from actions detrimental to Germany&#x27;s war effort or security.

Between 1950 and 1980, the most popular comedy duo of East Germany, Herricht &amp; Preil, ran a very successful double act, with Hans-Joachim Preil as the straight man and Rolf Herricht as the comic.

<text>Henri Herz (6 January 1803 – 5 January 1888) was a virtuoso pianist, composer and piano manufacturer, Austrian by birth and French by nationality and domicile. He was a professor in the Paris Conservatoire for more than thirty years. Among his major works are eight piano concertos, a piano sonata, rondos, nocturnes, waltzes, marches, fantasias, and numerous sets of variations.

==Biography==
Herz was born Heinrich Herz in Vienna. He was Jewish by birth, but he asked the musical journalist François-Joseph Fétis not to mention this in the latter&#x27;s musical encyclopaedia, perhaps a reflection of endemic antisemitism in nineteenth-century French cultural circles. As a child he studied with his father, and in Koblenz with the organist Daniel Hünten, father of the composer Franz Hünten. In 1816 Herz entered the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied piano with Louis-Barthélémy Pradher, harmony with Victor Dourlen and composition with Anton Reicha. He won first prize in piano in 1818. Herz&#x27;s style of playing was, by his own admission, strongly influenced by Ignaz Moscheles. His brother Jacques Simon Herz (born Jacob-Simon; 1794–1880) was a fellow-pupil at the Conservatoire who also became a pianist and teacher. In the first of many extended concert tours, Henri Herz—along with the violinist Charles Philippe Lafont—visited Germany and England in 1831 and 1834, respectively, winning great acclaim.

In 1825, Herz joined the piano workshop of Henri Klepfer et cie as a partner, but that connection proved unsuccessful, and in 1839 he founded his own piano factory, which became one of the three most important factories in France, the others being Erard and Pleyel. All three were awarded the &quot;Médaille d`honneur&quot; for &quot;Pianos d&#x27;une sonorité très-remarquable&quot; at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair in 1855. Among important developments of Herz&#x27;s early time as a piano maker in the 1820s and 1830s was the change from a single-layered hammer to one that was multi-layered, on the inside two layers of leather, several layers of fabric, and rabbit fur; on the outside wool felt in up to nine layers of decreasing hardness. The characteristic sound of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s grand pianos, to which the labor-intensive, hand-made hammers after Herz&#x27;s patents make a distinctive contribution, disappeared with mid-century developments in the USA (Steinway). The Herz hammer sets have the drawback that pianos cannot be played quite as loud, because the hammers are less densely pressed, but the dynamics and colorfulness – in combination with traditional materials of wrought iron strings (before the invention of Bessemer steel) – are very finely graduated and fiery. In the second half of the 19th century, simplification and impoverishment of the piano&#x27;s sound variety occurred with two-layer, industrially produced Dolge hammers. To Herz&#x27;s work as a piano maker can also be attributed the implementation of a simplified version of Sebastian Erard&#x27;s double repetition. Through the &quot;Herz spring&quot; (&quot;Repetierfeder&quot;) the mechanics of the instrument found their modern form.

In 1849, the Academy of San Juan de Letrán launched a convocation, with the object of acquiring a suitable letter for a hymn that represented Mexicans, especially abroad. In this call, three compositions were received, of which two were chosen: that of the American composer Andrew Davis Bradburn, and that of the Mexican poet Félix María Escalante, which was set to music by the Austrian Henry Herz; however, this hymn was not to the taste of the people.

Herz&#x27;s anthem appears in the 1934 film, Juárez y Maximiliano as Maximilian and Carlota&#x27;s musical theme. It also appears in Carlota: The Mad Empress.

Among the most important performance venues in Paris were halls built by the instrument manufacturers. In 1838, Herz and his brother Jacques Simon Herz followed this model and built the 668-seat Salle des Concerts Herz on the rue de la Victoire, used for performances by Berlioz and Offenbach. The Ecole Spéciale de Piano de Paris, which the brothers founded, was housed in the same building. The building was still in use for concerts as late as 1874 but was demolished in that year.

Herz was possibly married to Pauline Thérèse Lachmann (or Esther Lachmann), a French courtesan known as La Païva. It is generally believed that they married in London, but it is not clear that this actually occurred. In any case, such a marriage would have been bigamous, as she was already married. By him she had a daughter. Her extravagant spending nearly ruined Herz&#x27;s finances, and he traveled to America in 1848 to pursue business opportunities. While he was away, Herz&#x27;s family turned Thérèse out of the house.

===Career as a pianist===
A celebrated pianist, Herz traveled worldwide, including tours in Europe, Russia, Mexico, South America, and in the United States of America between 1846 and 1850, where he concertized all the way to San Francisco. His performances were compared to the more extravagant manner of Leopold de Meyer, concertizing in the United States during the same period (1845–47). He wrote a book about his experiences abroad, &quot;Mes voyages en Amérique&quot; (Paris: Achille Faure, 1866), translated by Henry Bertram Hill as &quot;My Travels in America&quot; (1963).

Herz taught at the Conservatoire between 1842 and 1874. Of his pupils, only Marie-Aimée Roger-Miclos (1860–1950) recorded, in the early 1900s, for Dischi Fonotipia.

==Works==

Herz composed many pieces, the opus numbers of his published works reaching 224, according to Laure Schnapper&#x27;s catalogue (Henri Herz, &quot;magnat du piano&quot;, 2011, p. 270–280). Virtually all are for the piano, including eight piano concertos. Among his many musical works, he was involved in the composition of &quot;Hexaméron&quot; (the fourth variation on Bellini&#x27;s theme is his). Many, however, found his piano style showy and shallow. Robert Schumann was among those who criticized it, but his wife Clara saw in it the praiseworthy quality that it could challenge a performer&#x27;s interpretation.

==Inventions==
Herz was also an inventor of a mechanical device he named a dactylion, designed to loosen and strengthen a pianist&#x27;s fingers. The device consisted of two parallel wooden bars, where the bottom one could be attached under a keyboard to fix the dactylion in place; and the top bar had ten rings hanging on strings for individual fingers to provide certain resistance while playing the piano. The dactylion had a considerable success then. He patented the dactylion in France in 1835. In the period 1843-1866 he also registered several patents related to construction and fabrication of pianos.

<text>Darwin is a settlement in Lafonia on East Falkland, Falkland Islands, lying on Choiseul Sound, on the east side of the island&#x27;s central isthmus, north of Goose Green. It was known occasionally (and still is from time to time) as Port Darwin.

Attractions in Darwin include a corral, the Galpon building which was home to nineteenth-century gauchos, the Argentine Military Cemetery, and birdlife both in the Sound and the pond. There is also a small racecourse here, for local amateur and hobby horse riders.

==History==
It is named after Charles Darwin, who carried out a zoological survey of the Falkland Islands on the Beagle&#x27;s second voyage. Darwin was said to have spent the night here.

Approximately quarter of a century after Charles Darwin&#x27;s visit, the settlement of Darwin was founded. The first building, erected in 1859, was the vicarage. It was started as the centre for sheep farming in Lafonia, which it remained until 1922. The farm was then transferred to Goose Green, south of Darwin and separated by the Boca Wall of peat, which grew to overshadow Darwin. Darwin was initially the haunt of &quot;gauchos&quot;, and cattle farmers, but sheep farming came to dominate the area, and Scottish shepherds were brought in.

A few years later, the first large tallow works in the islands (though not the first) was set up by the FIC in 1874. It handled 15,891 sheep in 1880.

From the 1880s, until 1972, Darwin and Fox Bay had their own separate medical officers. Nowadays, most medical care is based in Stanley.

A telephone line was constructed between Darwin and Stanley in 1906, with the ship &quot;Consort&quot; landing poles on the coast. The Darwin line was finished in 1907, at a length of . The line was initially only for business, but the public could make calls from time to time. It suffered a few breakages in the early years of operations.

The Darwin Harbour Sports Association organised one of the earliest reported Cricket matches in the Falklands on February 7, 1912. It was between the teams of married and single men. The Single men won on that occasion.

There are two listed buildings here, the &quot;galpon&quot; and the Stone Corral.

===Falklands War===
Darwin and environs saw heavy fighting in the Falklands War during the Battle of Goose Green. A large number of Argentine casualties were buried near here.

On the morning of May 28, British troops from the 2nd PARA Regiment took Darwin Hill after fierce fighting with Argentine forces.

The GADA detachment, unaware of the situation, observed several platoons advancing down the southern slopes of the ridge. Identifying them as British, GADA 601 section engaged them in direct-fire mode. The 35 mm bursts blocked the advance of the leading companies of the 2nd PARA Regiment, who suffered a number of casualties. C Company bore the brunt of the Argentine fire, the Headquarters section of C Company was effectively put out of action and 20% of the Company were injured, including the commander, Major Roger Jenner, and his signallers. The rear platoon, attached from A Company, was forced to remain behind Darwin Hill for the rest of the battle.

The last direct-fire mission of GADA 601’s section targeted the Darwin school-house, a position recently taken by troops of D Company. The building was already on fire due to the use of white phosphorus grenades by the British, it was then systematically destroyed by 35 mm rounds and burnt to the ground, resulting in further casualties for the paratroopers.

The British advance from this area was eventually halted on the orders of Major Chris Keeble who decided to stop the advance in order to consolidate his position.

Shortly after, the GADA position was subjected to mortar fire, and the power generator of the guns was damaged beyond repair. A later Harrier strike was inaccurate and failed to hit the GADA 601 position, as corroborated by a British account of the action. The mortar barrage, however, forced the section to seek shelter. With the garrison now isolated and surrounded, the Argentine commanding officer chose to surrender the following day.

<text>Fry and Laurie are an English comedy double act, mostly active in the 1980s and 1990s, composed of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. The two met in 1980 through mutual friend Emma Thompson while all three attended the University of Cambridge. Following appearances on TV sketch show &quot;Alfresco&quot;, &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, and revue series &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, they gained prominence on television sketch comedy &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot; (1987, 1989, 1995), actress Deborah Norton appearing in many of the sketches in the first series.

Fry and Laurie have collaborated on numerous other projects including, most notably, the television series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; (1990–1993), in which they portrayed P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s literary characters Jeeves (Fry) and Wooster (Laurie).

Since the conclusion of &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot;, both have gone on to solo careers in acting, writing and other roles. They reunited for a retrospective show in 2010 titled &quot;Fry and Laurie Reunited&quot;. On 14 May 2012, Fry announced he and Laurie were working together on a new project, which came to be an animated adaption of Oscar Wilde’s 1887 story &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;. The film was released on October 20, 2023, and features Freddie Highmore as The Duke of Cheshire alongside Fry as Sir Simon de Canterville and Laurie as the Grim Reaper. 

Fry and Laurie have remained close friends throughout their careers. Laurie frequently thanks Fry when accepting awards, including at the 2007 Golden Globes when he referred to his former comedy partner, in the old &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot; style, as &quot;m’colleague Stephen Fry&quot;.

<text>Roy Alton Blount Jr. (; born October 4, 1941) is an American writer, speaker, reporter, and humorist.

==Life and career==
Blount was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and grew up in Decatur, Georgia. He attended Ponce de Leon Elementary School and graduated from Decatur High School, where he was class president and editor of the school newspaper, &quot;The Scribbler&quot;. He received the Grantland Rice Journalism Scholarship to study journalism at Vanderbilt University, where he distinguished himself and was Phi Beta Kappa and graduated magna cum laude. He went on to Harvard University, where he received his MA degree. Blount is married to painter Joan Griswold; they reside in New Orleans and western Massachusetts.

Blount was a staff writer and associate editor with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; from 1968 to 1975, and has continued to contribute to the magazine thereafter. During his last few years with the magazine, he authored &quot;About Three Bricks Shy of a Load&quot;, a chronicle of the 1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season which was released in 1974. The source of the book&#x27;s title was Craig Hanneman whose endearing description of himself and his teammates after an away victory over the Oakland Raiders was &quot;We’re all about three bricks shy of a load.&quot;

In 2002, he narrated &quot;The Main Stream&quot;, a PBS documentary about the Mississippi River. As of 2024, he is featured regularly as a panelist on the NPR news/comedy quiz show, &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; He was also a recurring guest on &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;. In May 2010, he made a cameo appearance on HBO&#x27;s series &quot;Treme&quot; about post-Katrina New Orleans.

Blount performs with the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock band composed entirely of writers.

Blount is also a former president of the Authors Guild. On February 24, 2009, he wrote an op-ed article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; explaining the Authors Guild&#x27;s position demanding extra royalties from the text-to-speech functionality of the Amazon Kindle 2. To criticism from the American National Federation of the Blind, he replied that free audio availability of copyright works to the blind is provided for automatically by American copyright laws. To the criticism that the Kindle&#x27;s functionality is equivalent to parents reading aloud to their children, he said, &quot;the Authors Guild does not expect royalties from anybody doing non-commercial performances of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;. If parents want to send their children off to bed with the voice of Kindle 2, however, it’s another matter.&quot;

<doc id="817468" wikidata="Q451156" url="?curid=817468" title="William of Villehardouin">
<text>William of Villehardouin (; Kalamata, 1211 – 1 May 1278) was the fourth prince of Achaea in Frankish Greece, from 1246 to 1278. The younger son of Prince Geoffrey I, he held the Barony of Kalamata in fief during the reign of his elder brother Geoffrey II. William ruled Achaea as regent for his brother during Geoffrey&#x27;s military campaigns against the Greeks of Nicaea, who were the principal enemies of his overlord, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople Baldwin II. William succeeded his childless brother in the summer of 1246. Conflicts between Nicaea and Epirus enabled him to complete the conquest of the Morea in about three years. He captured Monemvasia and built three new fortresses, forcing two previously autonomous tribes, the Tzakones and Melingoi, into submission. He participated in the unsuccessful Egyptian crusade of Louis IX of France, who rewarded him with the right to issue currency in the style of French royal coins.

In the early 1250s, William was the most powerful ruler of Frankish Greece. Most neighboring Frankish rulers acknowledged his suzerainty. In 1255, he laid claim to the northern , or third, of the Lordship of Negroponte on the island of Euboea. Although the two other rulers of Negroponte were his vassals, they rejected his claim. They gained the support of Venice, Guy I de la Roche, Lord of Athens, and other Frankish rulers. The conflict developed into a war of succession that caused much destruction in Euboea and mainland Greece. After William&#x27;s victory in Attica in May 1258, Guy and his allies surrendered. Guy was tried for his disloyalty but was allowed to keep his Achaean fiefs.

A succession crisis in Nicaea prompted the Epirote ruler Michael II Komnenos Doukas to form an anti-Nicaean coalition with William and Manfred of Sicily. In the summer of 1259, William and Michael assembled the bulk of their armies and marched as far as Pelagonia to fight the Nicaeans. The Frankish and Epirote troops could not cooperate effectively, and archers from the enemy camp harassed them continuously. After the Epirotes abandoned their allies unexpectedly, the Nicaeans inflicted a decisive defeat on the Franks. William fled from the battlefield, but he was captured and sent to Nicaea. He was still in prison when Nicaean troops seized Constantinople and destroyed the Latin Empire in July 1261. The triumphant Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos released William in return for three southern Morean fortresses in late 1261. The possession of the three forts facilitated further Byzantine expansion, and William was forced to seek external support. With the approval of Baldwin II, he swore fealty to the Angevin king of Sicily, Charles I. William acknowledged Charles and his descendants as his heirs in the Treaty of Viterbo on 24 May 1267. Charles sent troops to Achaea and with their help, William was able to resist Byzantine invasions during the last years of his reign.

==Background==
Ruling from 1246 to 1278, William was the fourth prince of Achaea. A state in Frankish Greece, Achaea was established in Byzantine territories in the Morea (in southern Greece) in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade. William&#x27;s father Geoffrey I of Villehardouin began the conquest of the Morea with a local Greek aristocrat&#x27;s support in late 1204. As his ally soon died, Geoffrey approached Boniface of Montferrat, the ruler of the newly established Frankish Kingdom of Thessalonica, for military aid. Boniface appointed William of Champlitte to accompany Geoffrey back to the Morea and they mustered 500 knights and for the campaign. They captured Patras and other Byzantine fortresses and forced the Messenian and Arcadian Greek aristocrats into submission. William of Champlitte received the title of Prince of Achaea from Pope Innocent III in November 1205. The Franks could not capture Monemvasia in southeastern Morea, and Greek corsairs seized the fortress. The Frankish conquerors were also unable to overcome the natives in the southeastern mountainous region.

In the newly established principality, Geoffrey held the Barony of Kalamata in Messenia in fief. When William died in 1208, Geoffrey assumed power likely with his peers&#x27; consent. He swore fealty to the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Henry, at the Parliament of Ravennika in 1209. Henry confirmed Geoffrey as the new Prince of Achaea and made him an immediate imperial vassal. The leaders of the Fourth Crusade had promised much of the Morea to Venice in their 1204 treaty about the distribution of the Byzantine Empire. In a new treaty Geoffrey recognized he held parts of his principality in fief from Venice, but the Venetians took no further steps to assert their theoretical suzerainty.

As the Franks could not conquer all the Byzantine territories, two successor states, Epirus and Nicaea, emerged on the western and eastern borderlands of the Byzantine Empire respectively. The Greeks of Epirus started the reconquest of the former Byzantine territories in Thessaly in the 1210s. They annihilated the Kingdom of Thessalonica and captured the city of Thessalonica in December 1224. Their expansion towards Constantinople came to an abrupt end when they suffered a massive defeat by the Bulgarians in the Battle of Klokotnitsa in 1230. The Greeks of Nicaea launched invasions against the Latin Empire from the east. By 1235, they reconquered Anatolia and seized a European bridgehead at Gallipoli. In theory, the princes of Achaea still owed allegiance to the Latin Emperors, but in practice Emperor Baldwin II would have been unable to defend Constantinople without Achaean military and financial support. In return, he acknowledged Geoffrey&#x27;s elder son and successor, Geoffrey II, as the overlord of the triarchs (three co-rulers) of the island of Negroponte (and possibly of other Aegean islands).

==Early life==

William was the second son of Geoffrey I of Villehardouin and his wife Elisabeth. Elisabeth remained in France when her husband left for the Fourth Crusade. She and their elder son, Geoffrey, only moved to Achaea when Geoffrey&#x27;s position stabilized after the Parliament of Ravennika. She gave birth to William in the castle of Kalamata around 1211. Growing up in the Morea, William could speak Greek like a native and he felt home with both Franks and Greeks. As a younger son, William received the Barony of Kalamata in fief, while his brother succeeded their father as prince around 1229. William married an unnamed daughter of Narjot de Toucy, a high-ranking official of the Latin Empire. He administered Achaea as regent during his brother&#x27;s military campaigns for the defense of Constantinople.

==Reign==

===Expansion and crusade===

William came to power in Achaea when the childless Geoffrey II died in the summer of 1246. By the time of William&#x27;s ascension, the relationship between Epirus and Nicaea had grown tense. In December 1246, Nicaean troops attacked and captured Thessalonica. William took advantage of the two Greek powers&#x27; conflict to complete the conquest of the southeastern Morea. He laid siege to Monemvasia with the support of a Venetian fleet and other Frankish rulers, including Guy I de la Roche, Lord of Athens (who owed allegiance to William for the Moreot fiefs of Argos and Nauplia), and Angelo Sanudo, Duke of the Archipelago. The defenders suffered because of famine, but they capitulated only in 1248, after William promised to respect their property and liberty. He rewarded the town&#x27;s leaders with estates and exempted them from feudal obligations. William&#x27;s conquest of Monemvasia forced the Tzakones of nearby Mount Parnon into submission. To secure his gains, William ordered the construction of new fortresses. First, in late 1248 and early 1249, he personally directed the construction of Mistra near the Mount Taygetus; then the castle of Grand Magne was built on the Laconian Gulf. A third castle, Beaufort, was constructed on the Messenian Gulf. These castles secured the Frankish control of the Mount Taygetus, forcing the local Slavic tribe of the Melingoi to acknowledge William as their ruler in return for the confirmation of their liberty.

Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy spent the winter of 1248–49 in Achaea. He was on the way to Cyprus where the participants of Louis IX of France&#x27;s crusade against Egypt were assembling. William decided to join the crusade and mustered 400 knights and armed a fleet of 24 ships before he left for Cyprus together with Hugh in May 1249. On the way, he sent 100 knights to Rhodes, an island that the Genoese had recently conquered from the Nicaeans, to strengthen its defence. From Cyprus, William accompanied Louis to Egypt and remained with him until the end of the abortive military campaign. As a reward, Louis granted him the right to mint coins in the style of the French . William returned to Achaea in May 1250. During the following five peaceful years, Achaea was the dominant power of Frankish Greece as most of the lesser Frankish rulers acknowledged William as their overlord.

===War of the Euboeote Succession===

Carintana dalle Carceri was one ruler of Negroponte, sharing Oreus and the island&#x27;s northern triarchy, or third, with Grapella of Verona. When she died in 1255, William wanted to seize her lordship, but Grapella laid claim to her inheritance. As the triarchs owed allegiance to both Achaea and Venice, Grapella could cite a 1216 ruling by the Venetian , or governor, of Negroponte, that stated a co-ruler of a triarchy was entitled to re-unite it if his or her partner died without issue. The lords of the island&#x27;s two other triarchies, Guglielmo I da Verona and Narzotto dalle Carceri, supported Grapella&#x27;s claim. The Venetian chronicler Marino Sanudo writes that the conflict developed into a war after William had Guglielmo and Narzotto imprisoned, because their wives convinced the Venetian Paolo Gradenigo to intervene and he seized the island&#x27;s capital, Chalcis. If the two triarchs were indeed incarcerated, they were held in captivity only for some months. William appointed his nephew Geoffrey of Briel to lead an army to Negroponte. The Achaean troops laid waste to the island and expelled the Venetians.

The Doge of Venice, Reniero Zeno, made Marco Gradenigo the new . Gradenigo gained the support of William&#x27;s vassal, William de la Roche and his brother, Guy I of Athens. Guglielmo of Verona and Narzotto dalle Carceri met Gradenigo at Guy&#x27;s seat in Thebes on 14 June 1256. At the meeting, the two triarchs rejected Achaean overlordship and swore fealty to Venice for their lordships. Two other Frankish lords, Thomas II d&#x27;Autremencourt, Lord of Salona and Ubertino Pallavicini, Marquess of Bodonitsa, joined the anti-Achaean coalition, while William secured the support of Othon de Cicon, Lord of Karystos in Negroponte and the Genoese. Gradenigo attacked Chalcis, and the Venetian infantrymen routed the Achaean cavalry near the city. 

The war quickly spread to mainland Greece. When William made preparations for an invasion of Attica, Geoffrey of Briel, who was the son-in-law of Guy of Athens, deserted him. Before long, Chalcis surrendered to the Venetians. William assembled his army and invaded Athens across the Isthmus of Corinth in the spring of 1258. Guy I of Athens and his allies tried to stop the invasion at Mount Karydi, but William inflicted a decisive defeat on them in May 1258. Guy and his allies fled to Thebes, and William pillaged Attica and Boeotia. William attacked Thebes, but the city&#x27;s archbishop persuaded him to abandon the siege. Guy pledged he would never fight against William and agreed to accept the decision of the High Court of Achaea for his disloyalty. After hearing Guy at Nikli, the Achaean aristocrats sitting at the High Court decided they could not judge the case because Guy owed fealty to William only for his Moreot domains, not for the Lordship of Athens. Instead of forfeiting Guy&#x27;s Moreot fiefs, the High Court referred his case for judgement to King Louis IX. As Guy accepted this ruling, peace was restored between the two Frankish rulers. Louis IX received Guy in Paris in June 1259. The King and the French barons decided Guy had done adequate penance for breaking his oath of fealty by undertaking the arduous journey to France.

===Defeat and captivity===

Doge Ranieri Zeno ordered the new of Negroponte, Andrea Barozzi, to conduct peace negotiations with William early in 1259, but he became embroiled in a new conflict between Epirus and Nicaea before the negotiations began. The Nicaean emperor, Theodore II Laskaris, was succeeded by an underage son, John IV Lascaris, in August 1258. An ambitious Nicaean aristocrat overthrew the child emperor&#x27;s guardians and had himself crowned co-emperor as Michael VIII Palaiologos. The ruler of Epirus, Michael II Komnenos Doukas, wanted to take advantage of the Nicaean power struggles by fostering a wide anti-Nicaean coalition. He offered the hands of his daughters Helena and Anna to the Hohenstaufen ruler of Sicily, Manfred, and William respectively. He promised a generous dowry to William—80,000 , the castle of Liconia and nearby lands in southern Thessaly. Since their possession could strengthen his hold on Oreus, William quickly accepted the offer. He married Anna in Patras late in the summer of 1258. Before the end of the year, he and his father-in-law met in Patras and concluded a formal alliance. According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;, Michael acknowledged William&#x27;s claim to a revived Kingdom of Thessalonica.

Michael VIII dispatched his brother, John Palaiologos, with fresh troops to Thessalonica. He sent envoys to Epirus, Sicily and Achaea to start peace negotiations, but Michael II, Manfred and William refused. Enforced by newly hired mercenary troops, John Palaiologos launched a full-scale invasion of Epirus. Unable to resist alone, Michael II called for his allies&#x27; assistance in the spring of 1259. William assembled the bulk of the Achaean army. The Aragonese version of the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;, in this respect a source of dubious reliability, estimates that &quot;eight thousand first-class men-at-arms and twelve thousand men on foot&quot; gathered for the campaign. William led the Achaean army across the Gulf of Corinth and joined his father-in-law at Arta. They marched to southern Thessaly, where reinforcements from Athens, Salona, Negroponte, Naxos and other Aegean islands joined them. After the Frankish and Epirote commanders decided to fight a pitched battle instead of attacking fortified towns, the allies marched to Macedonia as far as the plain of Pelagonia to meet the enemy force in June 1259. Although the combined number of the Epirote–Frankish soldiery outnumbered the Nicaean troops, their command remained divided.

John Palaiologos avoided battle, but his Cuman and Turkish archers continuously harassed the enemy camp. As their constant attacks exhausted the Franks and Epirotes, Michael II entered into negotiations with John Palaiologos&#x27;s envoys, who urged him to desert his Frankish allies. The Byzantine historian, George Pachymeres, asserts that the Epirote–Frankish coalition split after Achaean knights disrespected the beautiful Vlach wife of Michael II&#x27;s bastard son, John Doukas, because William refused to discipline them. Outraged by William&#x27;s rude remarks about his illegitimate birth, John Doukas deserted to the Nicaeans and convinced his father to abandon the campaign. John&#x27;s unexpected attack from the rear caused panic and the Franks&#x27; retreat quickly turned into a flight. Historian Kenneth Setton considers this whole episode, not reported by the more contemporary Akropolites, doubtful. Akropolites credits the allies&#x27; defeat to Michael II&#x27;s inability to resist the archers&#x27; attack. After his flight from the battlefield, the Epirotes either followed his suit or deserted to the Nicaean. As the Nicaean victory seemed inevitable, William fled towards Kastoria. Akropolites writes that William hid under a haystack, but a soldier recognized him by his large protruding teeth. He was shackled and sent to Nicaea together with Anseau of Toucy, Geoffrey of Briel and other Achaean aristocrats. Michael VIII demanded the entire Achaean principality for William&#x27;s release. William refused, stating that Achaea was &quot;a land acquired by force of arms, held by right of conquest&quot; by the conquerors&#x27; descendants, and that he could not surrender his vassals&#x27; territory. During his prolonged but comfortable captivity, Guy I of Athens assumed the regency for him in Achaea.

The Nicaeans failed to conquer Thessaly and Epirus after their victory at Pelagonia, but their hold of Thessalonica was secured. As the Latin Empire was in ruins and exhausted, Michael VIII decided to re-conquer Constantinople from the Latins. He concluded an alliance with Genoa to secure naval support for the siege, but his general, Alexios Strategopoulos, seized Constantinople without Genoese assistance, taking advantage of the absence of the Latin garrison on 25 July 1261. Michael VIII was again crowned emperor in the Hagia Sophia and quickly deposed his underage co-emperor, John IV. After the fall of the Latin Empire, new negotiations began between Michael VIII and William about the conditions of William&#x27;s release. They reached a compromise when William agreed to cede Mistra, Grand Magne and Monemvasia. As they had been built or conquered by William, their transfer did not violate Achaean customary law, but he could not cede frontier castles &quot;without the counsel and consent of his liegemen&quot;. To legalize the transfer of the three castles, William&#x27;s wife convoked the imprisoned Achaean lords&#x27; wives to a parliament. Although Guy I opposed the proposal, the &quot;parliament of dames&quot; consented to it because the Achaean ladies wanted their husbands back. Before releasing William, Michael VIII extracted an oath of fealty from him and took two Achaean ladies, Margaret of Passavant and an unnamed sister of John Chauderon, as hostages to secure William&#x27;s compliance with their agreement. William returned to Achaea late in 1261. After the Byzantines had taken possession of the three castles, the Tzakones and the Melingoi transferred their loyalty to Michael VIII.

===Conflicts with the Byzantines===

Neither William nor Michael VIII believed the peace treaty would be lasting: the Byzantines could use their Moreot bridgeheads for further expansion, while William could hardly acquiesce to the territorial losses. As a consequence of the Byzantine expansion in the Morea, William could rarely offer fiefs to western European knights, which diminished his principality&#x27;s military power. Yet the Byzantines refrained from launching major invasions against Achaea because the Frankish cavalry were still able to inflict severe defeats on them. Instead, they attacked poorly garrisoned fortresses and seized them with the support of the local Greeks and Slavs. Pope Urban IV released William from the oath he had taken at Constantinople under duress, and William started peace negotiations with the Venetians. In May 1262, William abandoned his claim to rule parts of Negroponte directly in return for the recognition of his suzerainty over the island. The Venetians were to destroy their seaside fort at Chalcis, but their quarter in the city was expanded.

The possession of the port of Monemvasia allowed the Byzantines to transfer troops to the Morea. By the end of 1262, they seized Cape Maleas and took control of the nearby Mani Peninsula. Pope Urban IV urged the Catholic bishops and abbots of Frankish Greece to support the Achaeans against the &quot;schismatic&quot; Byzantines on 27 April 1263, but he soon realized he could achieve his principal goal, the unity of Christendom, only through negotiating with Michael VIII. Michael VIII sent a new army to Monemvasia in the summer of 1263. The Byzantines invaded Arcadia and seized small fortresses, but the Franks routed them near William&#x27;s capital at Andravida. Another Byzantine army marched towards Kalavryta and seized it with the support of the local population. Next year, the Byzantine commander John Kantakouzenos launched a new invasion of Arcadia, but he perished in a skirmish near Andravida. As he had failed to pay off his Turkish mercenaries, they entered into William&#x27;s service. With their support, William defeated the Greeks at Nikli and laid siege to Mistra, but he could not capture it.

In response to the Byzantine offensive in the Morea, Urban IV proclaimed a crusade against Michael VIII, but he also appointed new delegates to start negotiations with him about the church union. Manfred of Sicily was willing to support the Franks against the Byzantines by force, but Pope Urban, who regarded Manfred as the principal enemy of the Papacy, rejected the offer. Instead of promoting an anti-Byzantine coalition, the papal delegates mediated a reconciliation between Michael VIII and William before the Pope died in October 1264.

===Angevin suzerainty===

Urban&#x27;s successor, Pope Clement IV, granted the Kingdom of Sicily to King Louis IX&#x27;s ambitious younger brother, Charles I of Anjou in 1265. Charles invaded southern Italy, and Manfred died fighting against the invaders in the Battle of Benevento on 26 February 1266. Charles took full control of Manfred&#x27;s kingdom and revived his plans for an anti-Byzantine coalition. As negotiations on the church union had not yielded results, Pope Clement embraced Charles&#x27; idea. He summoned Charles, the titular Latin Emperor Baldwin II and William to Viterbo in Italy to discuss the conditions of an invasion of the Byzantine Empire by Charles. Charles and William reached an agreement after lengthy discussions. William swore fealty to Charles and promised not to &quot;make enfeoffment which will remain in effect after&quot; his death &quot;beyond 14,000  of land&quot;. He consented to the marriage of his daughter, Isabella, with Charles&#x27;s younger son, Philip. Although his wife was pregnant, William acknowledged Charles and Charles&#x27;s descendants as his heirs even if Isabella and Philip had no children and Anna gave birth to a son, only stipulating their son&#x27;s right to hold one-fifth of Achaea in fief of the Angevins. As historian Peter Lock emphasizes, William&#x27;s concessions show &quot;the straits to which the principality had been reduced by the Greek offensive&quot;. In return, Charles promised military support to recover the territory lost to the Byzantines, but the details of his assistance remained unclarified. Baldwin II confirmed the treaty and ceremoniously ratified in the presence of the Pope, 14 cardinals and further ecclesiastic and secular dignitaries in the papal chamber in Viterbo on 24 May 1267. In a separate treaty, Baldwin II ceded all his suzerain rights over Achaea to Charles and his successors in return for Charles&#x27; promise to assist him to recover Constantinople within six or seven years.

As Charles&#x27;s loyal vassal, William led 400 knights to fight against Charles&#x27;s opponent, the young Hohenstaufen prince Conradin in the Battle of Tagliacozzo on 23 August 1268. On his return to Achaea in January 1269, William captured Valona to establish a secure bridgehead for Charles&#x27;s troops on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. The Achaean barons formally recognized the Treaty of Viterbo in the presence of Charles&#x27;s envoys in 1270. Next year, Charles appointed the Marshal of Sicily, Dreux of Beaumont, to represent him as captain general in Achaea. 

At the same time, the adventurer Licario had seized a sturdy fortress near Karystos in Euboea. He made an alliance with the Byzantines, and with their support, he undertook to conquer the entire island. William and Dreux launched a joint military campaign against Licario and recaptured the fortress La Cuppa at Avlonari from him. The Byzantines launched two major invasions against Achaea between 1270 and 1275, but William was able to repel them with the support of Angevin troops. Walter of Rosières, who held the Barony of Akova in Achaea, died childless and his heir, Margaret of Passova was still held as hostage for William in Constantinople. William claimed the barony escheated to the crown because she failed to claim it personally within the customary period of a year and a day. After her return from Constantinople, Margaret revived her claim to Akova and took the influential aristocrat John of Saint Omer as her husband to secure his support. Saint Omer convinced William to compensate Margaret, and he restored one-third of the barony to her in 1276.

As William&#x27;s son-in-law Philip died childless early in 1277, it was evident that Charles or Charles&#x27;s offspring would inherit Achaea from William on his death. He died on 1 May 1278. With his death, the male line of the Villehardouin family became extinct. Charles succeeded him without opposition, but he allegedly never visited Achaea. Galeran of Ivry represented Charles in the principality as bailli and vicar-general.

==Legacy==

Historian Kenneth M. Setton describes William as &quot;the most lordly of the princes of Achaea&quot;, emphasizing the strength and prestige of Achaea reached its zenith during William&#x27;s rule around 1250. The author Nicolas Cheetham writes William was ambitious &quot;and headstrong by nature&quot;, but his &quot;political projects, conceived on a grand scale, were apt to fail because he over-estimated his strength and took too many risks&quot;. William is the key protagonist of the &quot;Chronicle of Morea&quot;. Marino Sanudo the Elder emphasizes the prosperity of William&#x27;s principality, mentioning merchants could travel in Achaea safely, without using cash. He says that William&#x27;s court &quot;appeared greater than a great king&#x27;s court&quot;. William was noted as a trouvère (composer). Two of his compositions have been preserved in the , a richly illuminated 13th-century collection of ballads and poems.
Achaea could never regain its power after the Nicaean victory at Pelagonia. Although the Byzantine governors of the Morea conquered the baronies of Passavant and Kalavryta during the last years of his reign, William kept most lands he had inherited from his brother. After the Treaty of Viterbo, Achaea &quot;passed for the duration of its checkered history into the orbit of Neapolitan politics, warfare, and intrigue&quot;. With opening the princely print at Glarentza, William put an end to his principality&#x27;s dependence on Byzantine coins. The Achaean coins were struck on the patterns of William&#x27;s coins during the reign of his successor.

==Family==

William&#x27;s first wife, the unnamed daughter of Narjot of Toucy, was King Louis IX&#x27;s second cousin through her grandmother, Agnes of France. Cheetham writes she died before William inherited Achaea from his brother. Historian Karl Hopf conjectured that Carintana dalle Carceri was William&#x27;s second wife. As Setton writes, she &quot;comes to life in the pages of Frankish history only on the day she died, for her death caused the war of the Euboeote succession&quot;. Setton, among other scholars, endorses Raymond-Joseph Loenertz&#x27;s refutation of Hopf&#x27;s conjecture. He writes that Hopf misinterpreted Marino Sanudo&#x27;s report of her death and its consequences. However, other authors, including Cheetham and Peter Lock, mention her as William&#x27;s wife.

William&#x27;s next wife, Anna Komnene Doukaina, took the name of Agnes on their marriage. Their elder daughter, Isabella, could not return to Achaea from Naples after the death of her first husband Philip of Anjou. In 1289, Charles I&#x27;s son and successor, Charles II, restored her right to rule Achaea and married her off to his distant cousin Florent of Hainaut. After Florent died in 1297, she ruled Achaea alone until her third marriage with Philip of Savoy in 1301. The Achaean barons disliked Philip, and Charles II released them from their allegiance to the couple in 1306. Isabella died in exile in 1311. William&#x27;s younger daughter by Anna–Agnes, Margaret, received the two-thirds of the Barony of Akova from his father in 1276. She married Isnard of Sabran first. Her second marriage was to Richard I Orsini, Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, in 1299. In 1311, she claimed William had bequeathed Achaea to her in a secret will on his deathbed. Her claim gave rise to civil war between the supporters of her niece Matilda of Hainaut and her son-in-law Ferdinand of Majorca after she died in 1315.

<text>Goose Green, also known simply as Goose, is a hamlet in Lafonia on East Falkland in the Falkland Islands. It lies on Choiseul Sound, on the east side of the island&#x27;s central isthmus, south-southwest of Darwin. With a population of about 40, it is the third-largest settlement of the Falkland Islands, after Stanley and Mount Pleasant.

Goose Green has a shop and a small airfield. Local attractions include the nearby Bodie Suspension Bridge and the shipwreck of the &quot;Vicar of Bray&quot;, which participated in the California gold rush.

At , Goose Green farm is double the size of the farms at Port Howard and North Arm. During the Falklands War, it was the scene of the Battle of Goose Green.

==History==
Goose Green was established in 1875, as the site of a tallow factory.

According to the &quot;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, at the turn of the 20th century, many of the local inhabitants were Scottish, which in part is reflected by the nearby placename, Brenton Loch. There were thirteen people recorded as living here at that time. At about this time, Goose Green began to take off:


Despite this setback, the settlement grew after it became the base for the Falkland Islands Company&#x27;s sheep farm in Lafonia in 1922 - the population rose to nearly 200, with improved sheep handling and wool shed being built. In 1927, the settlement&#x27;s huge sheep shearing shed was built, which is claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest, with a capacity of five thousand sheep. However, this claim is hard to verify. In 1979, 100,598 sheep were shorn at Goose Green.

Up until the 1970s, Goose Green was the site of a boarding school, run by the state. &quot;Camp&quot; children boarded here, and there were 40 spaces. The boarding school was later transferred to Stanley, although the recent emphasis has been on locally based education. The school itself became an Argentine HQ, and was burnt down. A new (day) school has been built for local children.

The town population has shrunk since the Falklands War. In 1982, there were a hundred residents; in 2000 there were forty. It is now part of the Falkland Landholdings Corporation, a government-managed company.

There are two listed buildings here, the Stone Cottage, and the village hall.

The area is home to the Falkland Islands radar antenna array, part of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), an international radar network for studying the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. The array, comprising 16 50-foot masts, began work in 2010.

===Falklands War===
Goose Green was occupied by Argentine forces during the Falklands War. Over one hundred islanders were imprisoned in the community hall, while over 1,200 Argentine troops occupied the settlement and nearby Darwin.

On 28–29 May 1982, it was the subject of the first land battle of that conflict (see Battle of Goose Green), as it was relatively close to the site of the British landings, San Carlos, and the British leaders were looking for an early victory, even if the site was not necessarily of military importance.

<text>Joe Gold (born Sidney Gold; March 10, 1922 – July 11, 2004) was an American bodybuilder and businessman. He was the founder of Gold&#x27;s Gym and World Gym. He has been credited with being the father of the bodybuilding and the fitness craze.

==Early life==
Joe Gold was the youngest of four siblings, Robert Gold (born Ruben Gold), Nathan Gold and Eunice Gold Fiss. His parents, Max Gold (born Abraham Mordechai Goldglejt) and Jennie Gold Glick Sussman (born Zelda Feierman) were both Jewish emigrants having relocated from Belarus to Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. Max Gold was the neighborhood junk collector and the family&#x27;s back yard and garage served as a makeshift junk yard. His mother, Jennie, was a seamstress who divorced Joe&#x27;s father and remarried two additional times. Joe attended Theodore Roosevelt High School.

He developed an interest in bodybuilding at the age of 12, when he saw his sister-in-law&#x27;s design for strengthening her arms. She had attached a filled bucket to each end of a broom handle and was using them as lifts. Joe and his brother, Robert Gold, got the idea for building their own equipment from scrap obtained from their father&#x27;s scrap yard in Boyle Heights. As a teenager he headed for Muscle Beach in Santa Monica.

A machinist, he worked in the United States Merchant Marine and served in the United States Navy during World War II, where he was badly injured in a torpedo attack, and also in the Korean War.

==Career==
As a professional bodybuilder, he auditioned for Mae West with a group of musclemen. West approved, saying &quot;I&#x27;ll take all of you.&quot; Gold subsequently toured the country with her revue. He also appeared as an extra in two epic movies, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; and &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, both released in 1956.

In 1965, Joe Gold opened the first Gold&#x27;s Gym in Venice, California. It quickly became a landmark for local bodybuilders despite the dirty fixtures of its first incarnation. Joe Gold was known for the personal encouragement he gave trainers, although delivered in sarcastic jabs at their faults.

Among Joe Gold&#x27;s many devotees was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who began working out at the gym in 1968 soon after arriving in the US. Schwarzenegger called Joe Gold &quot;a trusted friend and father figure.&quot;

Joe Gold opened new gyms and designed the equipment for them. His innovations revolutionized the sport, enabling people to exercise more easily with machines. He sold the Gold&#x27;s Gym chain in 1970.

In 1977, he launched World Gym in Santa Monica (later in Marina del Rey), which he owned and operated until his death.

==Death and legacy==
Joe died on July 11, 2004, at age 82, in Marina del Rey. The first Joe Gold Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Ric Drasin at the 2012 World Gym International Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada.

<doc id="817478" wikidata="Q1626009" url="?curid=817478" title="Homer Davenport">
<text>Homer Calvin Davenport (March 8, 1867 – May 2, 1912) was a political cartoonist and writer from the United States. He is known for drawings that satirized figures of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, most notably Ohio Senator Mark Hanna. Although Davenport had no formal art training, he became one of the highest paid political cartoonists in the world. Davenport also was one of the first major American breeders of Arabian horses and one of the founders of the Arabian Horse Club of America.

A native Oregonian, Davenport developed interests in both art and horses as a young boy. He tried a variety of jobs before gaining employment as a cartoonist, initially working at several newspapers on the West Coast, including &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, purchased by William Randolph Hearst. His talent for drawing and interest in Arabian horses dovetailed in 1893 at the &quot;Chicago Daily Herald&quot; when he studied and drew the Arabian horses exhibited at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. When Hearst acquired the &quot;New York Morning Journal&quot; in 1895, money was no object in his attempt to establish the &quot;Journal&quot; as a leading New York newspaper, and Hearst moved Davenport east in 1885 to be part of what is regarded as one of the greatest newspaper staffs ever assembled. Working with columnist Alfred Henry Lewis, Davenport created many cartoons in opposition to the 1896 Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley, and Hanna, his campaign manager. McKinley was elected and Hanna elevated to the Senate; Davenport continued to draw his sharp cartoons during the 1900 presidential race, though McKinley was again victorious.

In 1904, Davenport was hired away from Hearst by the &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot;, a Republican paper, and there drew a favorable cartoon of President Theodore Roosevelt that boosted Roosevelt&#x27;s election campaign that year. The President in turn proved helpful to Davenport in 1906 when the cartoonist required diplomatic permission to travel abroad in his quest to purchase pure desert-bred Arabian horses. In partnership with millionaire Peter Bradley, Davenport traveled extensively amongst the Anazeh people of Syria and went through a brotherhood ceremony with the Bedouin leader who guided his travels. The 27 horses Davenport purchased and brought to the United States had a profound and lasting impact on Arabian horse breeding. Davenport&#x27;s later years were marked by fewer influential cartoons and a troubled personal life; he dedicated much of his time to his animal breeding pursuits, traveled widely, and gave lectures. He was a lifelong lover of animals and of country living; he not only raised horses, but also exotic poultry and other animals. He died in 1912 of pneumonia, which he contracted after going to the docks of New York City to watch and chronicle the arrival of survivors of the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

== Childhood and early career ==
Davenport was born March 8, 1867 in the Waldo Hills, several miles south of Silverton, Oregon. His parents were Timothy Woodbridge and Florinda Willard (Geer) Davenport. The family had deep progressive roots; Davenport&#x27;s grandfather, Benjamin, had been a doctor and abolitionist whose home in Ohio was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Davenport&#x27;s parents, who had married in 1854, previously lost two other children in infancy to diphtheria, but Homer and his older sister, Orla, lived to adulthood. Timothy Davenport trained in medicine, but became a surveyor and writer later dubbed &quot;The Sage of Silverton&quot;. He had been the Indian agent for the Umatilla Agency in 1862, surveyor of Marion County in 1864, and later in his life, Oregon Land Agent (1895–1899). He was one of the founders of the Republican Party in Oregon, served as an Oregon state representative from 1868 to 1872 and was elected a state senator in 1882. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives on the Independent Party ticket in 1874.

Florinda Davenport was an admirer of the political cartoons of Thomas Nast that appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. While pregnant with Homer, she developed a belief, which she viewed as a prophecy, that her child would become as famous a cartoonist as Nast. She was also influenced by the essay &quot;How To Born A Genius&quot;, by Russell Trall, and closely followed his recommendations for diet and &quot;concentration&quot; during her pregnancy. She died of smallpox in 1870, when Homer was three years old, and on her deathbed asked her husband to give Homer &quot;every opportunity&quot; to become a cartoonist.

Young Davenport was given a box of paints as a Christmas gift. At this stage of his youth, as his father later stated, Homer also had &quot;horse on the brain&quot;. Cooped up inside during the winter of 1870–1871, in part because the entire family was quarantined on account of the smallpox outbreak that had killed Florinda, Timothy told Homer stories of Arab people and their horses. Soon after, at the age of three years and nine months, the boy used his paints to produce an image he called &quot;Arabian horses.&quot; He learned to ride on the family&#x27;s pet horse, Old John. Following his mother&#x27;s death, both of Davenport&#x27;s grandmothers helped raise him. Timothy Davenport remarried in 1872, to Elizabeth &quot;Nancy&quot; Gilmour Wisner, and in 1873, the family moved to Silverton—the cartoonist later recounted that the move to the community, about south of Portland and with a population of 300 at the time, was so he &quot;might live in the Latin Quarter of that village and inhale any artistic atmosphere that was going to waste&quot;.

Homer began to study music, and was allowed to help Timothy clerk at the store the elder Davenport purchased when he first moved to Silverton. Timothy required Homer to milk the cows, but otherwise Homer was to &quot;study faces and draw.&quot; He was well-liked by the villagers, but they considered him shiftless—they did not consider drawing to be real work. He exhibited an interest in animals, especially fast horses and fighting cocks. Davenport later wrote that his fascination with Arabian horses was reawakened in his adolescent years with his admiration of a picture of an Arabian-type horse found on an empty can of horse liniment. He carefully cleaned the can and kept it as his &quot;only piece of artistic furniture&quot; for many years until forced to leave it behind when he moved to San Francisco. He also played in the community band in his formative years, and with that group young Davenport once traveled as far as Portland.

Davenport&#x27;s initial jobs were not successful. His first position outside Silverton began when a small circus came to town, and Davenport, in his late teenage years, left with it. He was assigned as a clown and to care for the circus&#x27;s small herd of horses, which he also sketched. He became disenchanted with the circus when he was told to brush the elephant&#x27;s entire body with linseed oil, a difficult task. He left the tour and tried to succeed as a jockey, despite being tall. Other early positions included clerking in a store, working as a railway fireman, and being a stoker on the &quot;Multnomah&quot;.

In 1889, Davenport attended the Mark Hopkins School of Art in San Francisco, California, where he was expelled after a month because of his cartooning; he returned to the school for a brief time in 1892. He worked for free at the Portland &quot;Evening Telegram&quot;, which published several of his drawings, but not for pay. In 1890, he attended Armstrong Business College, but dropped out after a few months.

Although his work took him from Silverton, for the remainder of his life, Davenport was often melancholy for his native Oregon, and in writing to relatives there, he repeatedly told them not to send him anything that would remind him of Silverton, because he would be plunged into despair.

==Newspaper career ==

=== West Coast years ===
Davenport&#x27;s first paid job in journalism, in 1889, was drawing for the Portland newspaper, &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, where he showed a talent for sketching events from memory. He was fired in 1890, it was said, for poorly drawing a stove for an advertisement—he could not draw buildings and appliances well. By another story, he was let go when there was only work for one in the paper&#x27;s engraving department, and he was junior man. He then worked for the &quot;Portland Sunday Mercury&quot;, traveling to New Orleans for a prizefight in January 1891 between Jack Nonpareil Dempsey of Portland and Bob Fitzsimmons. When he returned, he earned money through selling his drawings as postcards.
Davenport&#x27;s talent came to the attention of C. W. Smith, general manager of the Associated Press, and also Timothy Davenport&#x27;s first cousin. Smith got the young cartoonist a free pass on the railroad to San Francisco in 1891 and wrote a letter to the business manager of &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, essentially a demand that Davenport be hired. He was; the &quot;Examiner&quot; business manager had been greatly impressed by doodles that Davenport drew while waiting. At the &quot;Examiner&quot;, Davenport was not a cartoonist, but a newspaper artist who illustrated articles—the technology to directly reproduce photographs in newspapers was still a few years away. After a year at the &quot;Examiner&quot;, he was fired; several stories state that this occurred after he asked for a raise from his meager salary of $10 per week.

His work, including the New Orleans postcards, had attracted admirers, who, in addition to Smith, helped him to get a job with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 1892. While there, he attracted reader attention for his ability to draw animals. He resigned in April 1893 because he wanted to go to Chicago and see the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, and his contacts secured him a position with the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot;. At the &quot;Herald&quot;, one of his jobs was to illustrate the horse races at Washington Park. He was dismissed from the &quot;Herald&quot;, and in one account ascribed his dismissal to going every day to visit and sketch the Arabian horses on exhibit at the World&#x27;s Fair. However, more likely, the poor economy and the end of the fair caused the &quot;Herald&quot; to lay him off, and Davenport suggested as much in a 1905 interview. While at the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, he married Daisy Moor, who traveled from her home in San Francisco to Chicago in order to marry him.

Davenport returned to San Francisco and regained his position at the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. This time, he was allowed to caricature California political figures. By then, William Randolph Hearst owned the &quot;Examiner&quot;. In his early days as a newspaper tycoon, Hearst followed Davenport&#x27;s cartoons in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and when the cartoonist became well known for his satires of figures in the 1894 California gubernatorial campaign, hired him, more than doubling his salary. When a famous horse died and the &quot;Examiner&quot; lacked an image, Davenport, who had seen the animal the previous year, drew it from memory. Impressed, Hearst purchased the original drawing. Davenport took his responsibilities as political cartoonist seriously, traveling to Sacramento, the state capital, to observe the legislative process and its participants.

=== Transfer to New York &quot;Journal&quot;===
Hearst had been successful in California with the &quot;Examiner&quot;, and sought to expand operations to the nation&#x27;s largest city, New York. Several newspapers were available for sale, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but Hearst then lacked the resources to purchase them. In September 1895, having lost most of its circulation and its advertisers over the past year, Cincinnati publisher John R. McLean made his New York &quot;Morning Journal&quot; available at a price within Hearst&#x27;s means, and he bought it for $180,000. Hearst changed the name to the &quot;New York Journal&quot; and began to assemble what Hearst biographer Ben Procter deemed one of the greatest staffs in newspaper history. Under editor-in-chief Willis J. Abbot, the well paid staff included foreign correspondent Richard Harding Davis, columnist Alfred Henry Lewis, and humorist Bill Nye. Contributors included Mark Twain and Stephen Crane. Davenport was among a number of talented staff on the &quot;Examiner&quot; whom Hearst transferred to New York and employed on the &quot;Journal&quot; at a high salary.

In 1896, a presidential election year, Davenport was sent to Washington to meet and study some of the Republican Party&#x27;s potential candidates, such as Speaker of the House Thomas B. Reed. Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; was a Democratic paper, and Davenport would be expected to harshly caricature the Republican presidential candidate. The Republicans were anxious to take over the White House from Democrat Grover Cleveland; they were widely expected to do so, as the Democrats were blamed for the economic Panic of 1893, which had brought depression to the nation for the past three years. None of the potential Democratic candidates seemed particularly formidable, and the Republican nominee was expected to win in a landslide.

Reporters and illustrators on the &quot;Journal&quot; often worked in pairs. Davenport was teamed with Lewis and the two soon forged a solid relationship. In early 1896, Lewis went to Ohio to investigate the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, that state&#x27;s former governor, William McKinley. To interview the candidate, Lewis was required to undergo an interview himself, with McKinley&#x27;s political manager, Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. Hanna had set aside his business career to manage McKinley&#x27;s campaign, and was paying all expenses for a political machine which helped make McKinley the frontrunner in the Republican race. Lewis got his interview with McKinley, then remained in Ohio, investigating Hanna. In 1893, Governor McKinley had been called upon to pay the obligations of a friend for whom he had co-signed loans; Hanna and other McKinley supporters had bought up or paid these debts. Lewis viewed Hanna as controlling McKinley, able to ruin the candidate by calling in the purchased notes. Becoming increasingly outraged by what he deemed as Hanna&#x27;s purchase of the Republican nomination, and so likely the presidency, Lewis began to popularize this view in the pages of the &quot;Journal&quot;. The first Davenport cartoon depicting Hanna appeared soon after.

=== 1896 election and Mark Hanna ===

McKinley, with the exception of his 1893 financial crisis, had avoided scandal and carefully guarded his image, making him difficult to attack. Hanna proved an easier target. Although Davenport had depicted Hanna in his cartoons before the Republican convention in June, these efforts were uninspired. This changed once Davenport got a look at his subject while attending the 1896 Republican National Convention in St. Louis. After three days spent closely observing Hanna managing the convention to secure McKinley&#x27;s nomination and passage of a platform supporting the gold standard, Davenport was impressed with Hanna&#x27;s dynamic behavior. Convinced that he could effectively lampoon Hanna, Davenport&#x27;s cartoons became more effective. Hanna was a tall man; Davenport exaggerated this trait, in part by shrinking everybody else. He also increased Hanna&#x27;s already substantial girth. Hanna&#x27;s short sideburns were lengthened and made rougher—Davenport described them as &quot;like an unplaned cedar board&quot;. Davenport borrowed from the animal kingdom for his creation, drawing Hanna&#x27;s ears so they stuck out like a monkey&#x27;s. The cartoonist described Hanna&#x27;s eyes as like a parrot&#x27;s, leaving no movement unseen, or as those of a circus elephant—scanning the street for peanuts.

The resultant caricature of Hanna was given props such as moneybags and laborer&#x27;s skulls to rest his feet upon, as well as cufflinks engraved with the dollar sign to wear with his plaid businessman&#x27;s suits. He was often accompanied by William McKinley, usually drawn as a shrunken though dignified figure dominated by the giant Hanna. Even so, Davenport felt the figure seemed to lack something until the cartoonist took the dollar signs from the cufflink and placed them inside every check of the cartoon Hanna&#x27;s suit. Davenport likely acted at the suggestion of his cartoonist colleague at the &quot;Journal&quot;, M. de Lipman, who had depicted McKinley as Buddha in a loincloth with Hanna as his attendant, robes ablaze with an array of dollar signs. According to Hearst biographer Kenneth Whyte, &quot;whatever its origins, Davenport&#x27;s &#x27;plutocratic plaid&#x27;, as it became known, was an instant hit.&quot;

In July 1896, the Democrats nominated former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan for president. Bryan had electrified the Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech. Bryan was an eloquent supporter of &quot;free silver&quot;, a policy which would inflate the currency by allowing silver bullion to be submitted by the public and converted into coins even though the intrinsic value of a silver dollar was about half its stated value. Bryan&#x27;s candidacy divided the Democratic Party and its supporters, and caused many normally Democratic papers to abandon him. Hearst called a meeting of his senior staff to decide the &quot;Journal&quot; policy. Though few favored the Democrat, Hearst decided, &quot;Unlimber the guns; we are going to fight for Bryan.&quot;

Davenport&#x27;s cartoons had an effect on Hanna. West Virginia Senator Nathan B. Scott remembered being with Hanna as he viewed his caricature wearing a suit covered with dollar signs, trampling women and children underfoot, and hearing the Ohioan state, &quot;that hurts&quot;. Hanna could not make public appearances without having to field questions about the cartoons. Nevertheless, publisher J. B. Morrow, a friend of both McKinley and his campaign manager, stated that Hanna &quot;took his course regardless of local criticism&quot;. McKinley made no attempt to deflect criticism from Hanna and in fact kept a file of Davenport cartoons that particularly amused him. Despite Hanna&#x27;s discomfiture, both men were content to have Hanna attacked if it meant that McKinley would not be.

Most of the cartoons Davenport drew during the 1896 campaign were simple in execution and somber in mood. One, for example, depicts Hanna walking down Wall Street, bags of money in each hand and a grin on his face. Another shows only Hanna&#x27;s hand and wrist—and McKinley dangling from his fob chain. One that is intended to be funny depicts McKinley as a small boy accompanied by Hanna as nursemaid; McKinley tugs at Hanna&#x27;s skirts, wanting to go into a shop where the labor vote is for sale. Another shows Hanna wearing a Napoleon hat (McKinley was said to resemble the late emperor), raising a mask of McKinley&#x27;s face to his own.
Davenport&#x27;s cartoons ran a few times per week in the &quot;Journal&quot;, generally on an inside page. They were, however, widely reprinted—including in Bryan&#x27;s campaign materials—and according to Whyte, &quot;nothing in any paper came close to matching their impact [on the presidential race]&quot;. Hanna biographer William T. Horner noted, &quot;Davenport&#x27;s image of Hanna in a suit covered with dollar signs remains an iconic view of the man to this day&quot;.

Despite great public excitement after his nomination, Bryan was unable to overcome his disadvantages in financing, organization, lack of party unity, and public mistrust of the Democrats, and he was defeated in the November election. A few days after the election, Davenport went to Republican headquarters in New York to be formally introduced to the man he had so sharply characterized. As witnesses such as Vice President-elect Garret Hobart came in to see the good-humored proceedings, Hanna told Davenport, &quot;I admire your genius and execution, but damn your conception.&quot;

With the 1896 campaign over, a reporter asked Davenport in February 1897 who would replace Hanna as a special subject of his cartoons, and Davenport replied, &quot;Hanna is by no means out of the way. He will probably continue a good subject for some time.&quot; Hanna, having declined the position of Postmaster General, secured appointment to the Senate when McKinley made Ohio&#x27;s aging senior senator, John Sherman, his Secretary of State. Until 1913, state legislatures, not the people, elected senators, and so Hanna had to seek election to a full term when the Ohio General Assembly met in January 1898. Hanna campaigned in the 1897 legislative election, and was elected to the Senate in his own right the following January, in a very close vote. Davenport drew cartoons against Hanna in the senatorial race. Nevertheless, when he attended the legislature&#x27;s meeting in Columbus, he wore a Hanna button, and seemed happy after Hanna&#x27;s triumph. When asked why, he replied, &quot;that insures me six more years at him, and he&#x27;s a good subject&quot;.

=== 1897 to 1901 ===

The 1896 campaign made Davenport famous and well paid, earning $12,000 per year, the highest compensation of any cartoonist of his time. Hearst, who had lost a fortune but who had established the &quot;Journal&quot; as one of New York&#x27;s most influential newspapers, also gave him a $3,000 bonus with which to take a trip to Europe with Daisy. In London, Davenport interviewed and drew the elderly former prime minister, William Gladstone. In Venice, he came upon a large statue of Samson. He was impressed by the large muscles of the work, and immediately conceived of it as representing America&#x27;s powerful corporate trusts, the status of which was then a major political issue. A large, powerful, grass-skirted figure representing the trusts would be seen with McKinley and Hanna in Davenport&#x27;s cartoons during the President&#x27;s re-election bid in 1900.

In 1897, Davenport was sent to Carson City, Nevada, to cover the heavyweight championship fight between boxers Bob Fitzsimmons and Jim Corbett, a match heavily promoted by the &quot;Journal&quot;. Fitzsimmons won. Davenport traveled to Nevada by way of Silverton, visiting there for the first time since becoming famous. The following year, Davenport went to Asbury Park, New Jersey, to watch Corbett in training. Davenport both interviewed him and made several drawings which the &quot;Journal&quot; published, including one of cartoonist and boxer sparring.

Davenport&#x27;s drawings left few public figures unscathed; he even caricatured himself and his boss, Hearst. Ultimately, Davenport&#x27;s work became so well recognized for skewering political figures he considered corrupt, that in 1897 his opponents attempted to pass a law banning political cartoons in New York. The bill, introduced in the state legislature with the prodding of U.S. Senator Thomas C. Platt, (R-NY), did not pass, but the effort inspired Davenport to create one of his most famous works: &quot;No Honest Man Need Fear Cartoons.&quot;

In 1897 and into 1898, the Hearst papers pounded a drumbeat for war with Spain. Davenport drew cartoons depicting President McKinley as cowardly and unwilling to go to war because it might harm Wall Street. Once the Spanish–American War was under way, one of the American war heroes was Admiral George Dewey, victor at the Battle of Manila Bay, who was welcomed home in 1899 with celebrations and the gift of a house. The admiral promptly deeded the residence over to his newlywed wife, a Catholic, turning public opinion (especially among Protestants) against him. However, resentment eased after Davenport depicted Dewey on his bridge during the battle, with the caption, &quot;Lest we forget&quot;.

In 1899, Davenport returned to Europe, covering the Dreyfus case in Rennes. In 1900, the presidential election again featured McKinley defeating Bryan, and again featured Davenport, reprising his depictions of Hanna, this time aided by the giant figure of the trusts. Also a subject of Hearst&#x27;s cartoonists was McKinley&#x27;s running mate, war hero and New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt, presented as a child with a Rough Rider&#x27;s outfit and little self-control.

=== 1901 to 1912===
The &quot;Journal&quot; was renamed the &quot;American&quot; in 1901. Davenport continued there until 1904, eventually earning $25,000 per year, a very large salary at the time. Following Hearst&#x27;s policy, he relentlessly attacked President Roosevelt, who had succeeded the assassinated McKinley in September 1901. Davenport both cartooned and wrote for the &quot;American&quot;; one column mockingly alleged that the new President had hidden all portraits of previous presidents in the White House basement, with the visitor left to view a large portrait of Roosevelt as well-armed Rough Rider.

Nevertheless, the Republicans wooed Davenport, seeking to deprive the Democrats of one of their weapons, and eventually President and cartoonist met. In 1904, Davenport left the &quot;American&quot; for the &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot;, a Republican paper, to be paid $25,000 for the final six months of 1904 (most likely paid by the party&#x27;s backers) and an undisclosed salary after that. The 1904 presidential campaign featured Roosevelt, seeking a full term in his own right, against the Democratic candidate, Judge Alton B. Parker of New York. Again Davenport affected the campaign, this time with a cartoon of Uncle Sam with his hand on Roosevelt&#x27;s shoulder, &quot;He&#x27;s good enough for me&quot;. The Republicans spent $200,000 reproducing it; the image was used as cover art on sheet music for marches written in support of Roosevelt.

Although Davenport continued at the &quot;Evening Mail&quot; after Roosevelt was elected, the quality of his work declined; fewer and fewer of his images were selected for inclusion in Albert Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Review of Reviews&quot;. He also began to devote large periods to other activities; in 1905, he spent months in his home state of Oregon, first visiting Silverton and then showing, at Portland&#x27;s Lewis and Clark Exposition, the animals he bred. 
In 1902, James Pond, a lecture circuit manager, hired Davenport as a speaker. Beginning in 1905, Davenport traveled on the Chatauqua lecture circuit, giving engaging talks, during which he sketched on stage. He sometimes appeared on the same program as Bryan, though on different days, and like him drew thousands of listeners. In 1906, he traveled to the Middle East to purchase Arabian horses from their native land, and then wrote a book in 1908 about his experiences. Davenport authored an autobiographical book, &quot;The Diary of a Country Boy&quot;, in 1910, and collections of his cartoons, including &quot;The Dollar or the Man&quot; and &quot;Cartoons by Davenport&quot;. Apparently as a joke, Davenport once included &quot;The Belle &quot;(or sometimes, &quot;Bell&quot; ) &quot;of Silverton and Other Oregon Stories&quot; in a list of his publications, and reference books for years listed it among his works. A book of that name did not exist, however. Some speculate that this was an early working title for &quot;The Country Boy.&quot;

Davenport&#x27;s marriage had failed by 1909, and he suffered a breakdown that year, related to his ongoing divorce case. As he recovered, he announced a forthcoming series to be available for license to newspapers, &quot;Men I have sketched&quot;. This project was aborted when, in 1911, Davenport was invited by Hearst to return to the &quot;American&quot;. He was on assignment for the &quot;American&quot; on April 19, 1912, when he met the RMS &quot;Carpathia&quot; at the docks in New York to draw the survivors of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. He drew three cartoons, but upon leaving his office was in a &quot;highly nervous state&quot;. That evening he fell ill at the apartment of a friend, Mrs. William Cochran, a medium and spiritualist. Diagnosed with pneumonia, he died in her home two weeks later, on May 2, 1912. Hearst paid for eight doctors to treat Davenport, and later for an elaborate funeral—the publisher had Davenport&#x27;s body returned to his beloved Silverton for burial. His funeral was a freethought service conducted by a spiritualist, Jean Morris Ellis.

Addison Bennett of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; wrote, &quot;Yes, Homer has come home for the last time, home to wander again never&quot;.

==Arabian horse breeder==

In addition to his cartooning, Davenport is remembered for playing a key role in bringing some of the earliest desert-bred or &quot;asil&quot; Arabian horses to America. A longtime admirer of horses, Davenport stated in 1905, &quot;I have dreamed of Arabian horses all my life.&quot; He had been captivated by the beauty of the Arabians brought to the Chicago Columbian Exposition in 1893. Upon learning that these horses had remained in America and had been sold at auction, he sought them out, finding most of the surviving animals in 1898 in the hands of millionaire fertilizer magnate Peter Bradley of Hingham, Massachusetts. Davenport bought some Arabian horses outright between 1898 and 1905, paying $8,500 for one stallion, but he later partnered with Bradley in the horse business. Among his purchases, he managed to gather all but one of the surviving horses that had been a part of the Chicago Exhibition.

===Desert journey===

In 1906, Davenport, with Bradley&#x27;s financial backing, used his political connections, particularly those with President Theodore Roosevelt, to obtain the diplomatic permissions required to travel into the lands controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Roosevelt himself was interested in breeding quality cavalry horses, had tried but failed to get Congress to fund a government cavalry stud farm, and considered Arabian blood useful for army horses. Davenport originally intended to travel alone, but was soon joined by two young associates anxious for an adventure in the Middle East: C. A. &quot;Arthur&quot; Moore Jr., and John H. &quot;Jack&quot; Thompson Jr. He traveled throughout what today is Syria and Lebanon, and successfully brought 27 horses to America.

To travel to the Middle East and purchase horses, Davenport needed to obtain diplomatic permission from the government of the Ottoman Empire, and specifically from Sultan Abdul Hamid II. In December 1905, Davenport approached President Roosevelt for help, and in January 1906, Roosevelt provided him a letter of support that he was able to present to the Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Chikeb Bey, who contacted the Sultan. To the surprise of both Davenport and the Ambassador, the permit, called an &quot;Iradé&quot;, was granted, allowing the export of &quot;six or eight&quot; horses. Davenport and his traveling companions left the United States on July 5, 1906, traveling to France by ship and from there to Constantinople by train. 

Upon arrival, the &quot;Iradé&quot; was authenticated, and clarified that Davenport would be allowed to export both mares and stallions. Davenport&#x27;s accomplishment was notable for several reasons. It was the first time Arabian horses officially had been allowed to be exported from the Ottoman Empire in 35 years. It was also notable that Davenport not only was able to purchase stallions, which were often available for sale to outsiders, but also mares, which were treasured by the Bedouin; the best war mares generally were not for sale at any price.

Before Davenport left Constantinople to travel to Aleppo and then into the desert, he visited the royal stables, and also took advantage of an opportunity to view the Sultan during a public appearance. He displayed his artistic ability and talent for detail by sketching several portraits of Abdul Hamid II from memory about a half-hour after observing him, as Davenport believed the ruler unwilling to have his image drawn. Davenport&#x27;s personal impression of the Sultan was sympathetic, viewing him as a frail, elderly man burdened by the weight of his office but kind and fatherly to his children. Davenport compared his appearance as a melding of the late congressman from Maine, Nelson Dingley, with merchant and philanthropist Nathan Straus, commenting of the Sultan, &quot;I thought ... that no matter what crimes had been charged to him, his expressionless soldiers, his army and its leaders were possibly more to blame than he.&quot; Believing that he needed to keep his sketches a secret, he carried the sketch book in a hidden pocket throughout his journey, and at customs smuggled it onto the steamer home hidden inside a bale of hay.

One reason for Davenport&#x27;s success in obtaining high-quality, pure-blooded Arabian horses was his (possibly accidental) decision to breach protocol and visit Akmet Haffez, a Bedouin who served as a liaison between the Ottoman government and the tribal people of the Anazeh, before calling upon the Governor of Syria, Nazim Pasha. Haffez considered the timing of Davenport&#x27;s visit a great honor, and gave Davenport his finest mare, a war mare named *Wadduda. Not to be outdone, the Pasha gave Davenport the stallion *Haleb, who was a well-respected sire throughout the region, known as the &quot;Pride of the Desert.&quot; Haleb had been given to the Pasha as a reward for keeping the camel tax low. Haffez then personally escorted Davenport into the desert, and at one point in the journey the two men took an oath of brotherhood. Haffez helped arrange for the best-quality horses to be presented, negotiated fair prices, and verified that their pedigrees were &quot;asil&quot;. Davenport chronicled this journey in his 1908 book, &quot;My Quest of the Arabian Horse.&quot;

The impact of the 17 stallions and 10 mares purchased by Davenport was of major importance to the Arabian horse breed in America. While what are now called &quot;Davenport&quot; bloodlines can be found in thousands of Arabian horse pedigrees, there are also some preservation breeders whose horses have bloodlines that are entirely descended from the horses he imported. Davenport&#x27;s efforts, as well as those of his successors, allowed the Arabian horse in America to be bred with authentic Arabian type and pure bloodlines.

===Arabians in America===
Upon his return to America, his newly imported horses became part of his Davenport Desert Arabian Stud in Morris Plains, New Jersey. By 1908, however, the Davenport Desert Arabian Stud was listed in the Arabian Stud Book as located in Hingham, Massachusetts, and he remained closely affiliated with Bradley&#x27;s Hingham Stock Farm, which became the sole owner of the horses after Davenport&#x27;s death in 1912. In 1908, Davenport became one of the five incorporators of the Arabian Horse Club of America (now the Arabian Horse Association). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognized the organization as the official registry for Arabian horses in 1909. Prior to that time, the Thoroughbred stud books of both the United Kingdom and the United States also handled the registration of Arabian horses. The reason a new organization, separate from the American Jockey Club, was needed to register Arabians came about largely because of Davenport. He had meticulously sought horses with pure bloodlines and known breeding strains with the expert assistance of Haffez, but once out of the desert, he was not aware that he also needed to obtain written affidavits and other paperwork to document their bloodlines. Additionally, because his Arabians were not shipped via Britain, they were not certified by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Jockey Club before arriving in America, and without that authentication, the American Jockey Club refused to register his imported horses. Another factor may have influenced the organization&#x27;s stance: in a cartoon, Davenport had satirized Jockey Club President August Belmont.

Haleb in particular became widely admired by American breeders, and in addition to siring Arabians, he was also crossed with Morgan and Standardbred mares. In 1907, Davenport entered the stallion into the Justin Morgan Cup, a horse show competition he won, defeating 19 Morgan horses. In 1909, Haleb died under mysterious circumstances. Davenport believed the horse had been poisoned. He had the stallion&#x27;s skull and partial skeleton prepared and sent to the Smithsonian Institution, where it became part of the museum&#x27;s research collection. Davenport also purchased horses from the Crabbet Park Stud in England, notably the stallion *Abu Zeyd, considered the best son of his famous sire, Mesaoud. In 1911, Davenport described *Abu Zeyd as &quot;the grandest specimen of the Arabian horse I have ever seen and I will give a $100 cup to the owner of any horse than can beat him.&quot;

Upon Davenport&#x27;s death, a significant number of his horses were obtained by W. R. Brown and his brother Herbert, where they became the foundation bloodstock for Brown&#x27;s Maynesboro Stud of Berlin, New Hampshire. Included in the purchase was *Abu Zeyd. The Maynesboro stud also acquired 10 mares from the Davenport estate.

==Personal life and other interests ==
Davenport married Daisy Moor of San Francisco on September 7, 1893; she had traveled to Chicago while the artist was working there. They had three children: Homer Clyde, born 1896; Mildred, born 1899; and Gloria Ward, born 1904. While living in a New York apartment between 1895 and 1901 not much is known of the Davenport home life except that the furnishings were luxurious. By 1901, Davenport had bought both a house in East Orange, New Jersey, and a farm in Morris Plains, New Jersey. He kept many of the animals he collected and bred, including pheasants and horses, at East Orange, but decided to move both animals and himself to Morris Plains, and take the rail line dubbed the &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Special&quot; to work in New York. He moved away from East Orange in 1906, though he still owned the house as late as 1909. In Morris Plains, the Davenports hosted large parties attended by celebrities, artists, writers, and other influential people of the day, including Ambrose Bierce, Lillian Russell, Thomas Edison, William Jennings Bryan, Buffalo Bill Cody, Frederic Remington, and the Florodora girls. Instead of using a regular guestbook, Davenport would have his guests sign the clapboard siding of his home to commemorate their visits.

Davenport bred various animals. &quot;I was born with a love of horses and for all animals that do not hurt anything ... I feel happiest when I am with these birds and animals,&quot; he said, &quot;I am a part of them without anything to explain.&quot; His understanding of the dynamics of purebred animal breeding was that deviation from the original, useful type led to degeneration of a breed. While best known as a horse breeder, he also raised pheasants—including exotic varieties from the Himalayas—and other breeds of birds. By 1905 he started a pheasant farm on his property in Morris Plains, gathering the birds he had kept on the west coast, and buying others from overseas using the profits from his first published book of cartoons. As of 1908 he owned the largest private collection of pheasants and wild waterfowl in America. At various times, his menagerie also contained angora goats, Persian fat-tailed sheep, Sicilian donkeys, and Chinese ducks. Three times, he built up collections of cockfighting roosters, once selling them to finance his start the first time he lived and worked in San Francisco.

In addition to his interest in horses and birds, Davenport was also fond of dogs, notably a bull terrier named Duff, obtained as a puppy. Davenport taught Duff to do tricks and profited by loaning the dog to perform in vaudeville acts. In 1908, Davenport involved himself in a controversy over the breeding of show-quality dogs, stating that he thought breeding solely for show purposes was creating an animal that was of inferior quality. He targeted certain popular breeders of purebred collies as producing animals that had less intelligence, were of poor temperament, and lacked utility. He pointedly named famous breeders whom he felt were making particularly poor decisions.

The Davenport marriage did not last; Daisy did not share many of her husband&#x27;s interests and intensely disliked Silverton. In 1909 they separated, and the parting was acrimonious. Homer initially returned to New York to live, but soon suffered a breakdown; he spent months recuperating in a resort hotel in San Diego, California, at the expense of his friend, sporting goods mogul Albert Spalding. Though he deeded his two properties over to Daisy, she sued for alimony, and had Homer held in contempt by a New York court for failure to pay support when he was not working. He returned to New York and obtained a new stock farm at Holmdel, New Jersey, in 1910. Though his father died in 1911, he began to pull his life together and returned to cartooning. He met a new companion, referred to in his papers only as &quot;Zadah&quot;, whom he intended to marry once his divorce case was concluded. However, he died before his scheduled August 1912 trial date.

==Legacy==

Davenport&#x27;s cartoons have had a lasting impact on the public image of Mark Hanna, both on how he was perceived at the time and on how he is remembered today. Early Hanna biographer Herbert Croly, writing in 1912, the year Davenport died, deemed his subject portrayed as a &quot;monster&quot; by the &quot;powerful but brutal caricatures of Homer Davenport&quot;. According to Horner, the portrayal of Hanna that has stood the test of time is one that depicts him &quot;side by side with a gigantic figure representing the trusts, and a tiny, childlike, William McKinley. He will forever be known as &quot;Dollar Mark&quot;, thanks to Homer Davenport and many other columnists who drew him as a malevolent presence. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech regretted Davenport&#x27;s effect on the former president&#x27;s image: &quot;the representation of McKinley as pitiable and victimized was a poor service to his reputation. The graphic impression of his spineless subservience to Hanna would long outlive the lies of [&quot;Journal&quot; columnist] Alfred Henry Lewis.&quot; Davenport&#x27;s obituary opined that he &quot;did for San Francisco what Thomas Nast did for New York.&quot;

According to Davenport&#x27;s biographers, Leland Huot and Alfred Powers, his Arabian horses &quot;were to perpetuate his fame on and on into future years more than his political cartoons, so that in ten thousand stables today he is known as having been a great, great man&quot;. Today, the term &quot;CMK&quot;, meaning &quot;Crabbet/Maynesboro/Kellogg&quot;, is a label for specific lines of &quot;Domestic&quot; or &quot;American-bred&quot; Arabian horses. It describes the descendants of horses imported to America from the desert or from Crabbet Park Stud in the late 1800s and early 1900s then bred on in the US by the Hamidie Society, Randolph Huntington, Spencer Borden, Davenport, W.R. Brown&#x27;s Maynesboro Stud, W. K. Kellogg, Hearst&#x27;s San Simeon Stud, and &quot;General&quot; J. M. Dickinson&#x27;s Traveler&#x27;s Rest Stud.

Silverton, Oregon, gives tribute to Davenport during its annual Homer Davenport Community Festival, held annually in August. The festival began in 1980.

<doc id="817479" wikidata="Q1754464" url="?curid=817479" title="Port Howard">
<text>Port Howard is the largest settlement on West Falkland (unless Fox Bay is taken as one settlement, instead of two). It is in the east of the island, on an inlet of Falkland Sound. It is on the lower slopes of Mount Maria (part of the Hornby Mountains range).

Port Howard is the centre of an 800-square-kilometre (200,000-acre) sheep farm, with twenty-two permanent residents and around 40,000 sheep. Sometimes this population is doubled by transitory residents.

The settlement has two airstrips which receive regular flights from Stanley, and it is also the West Terminal of the new East-West Ferry. The Falkland Islands Government built a network of all weather roads around East and West Falkland, Port Howard is at the northern end of the West Falkland network.

Every three years, Port Howard hosts the West Falklands Sports. This week-long celebration of the end of the shearing season combines horse-racing with other festivities. The Warrah River and Chartres River are nearby fishing rivers.

==History==
===Founding===
Port Howard was founded by James Lovegrove Waldron and his brother, in 1866. The Waldron brothers later left for Patagonia, leaving the farm under local management. In 1956, JL Waldron Ltd built a school at Port Howard — possibly inspired by the &quot;gift&quot; of the FIC, a few years, earlier at Darwin.

===Falklands War===
During the Falklands War, the settlement was occupied by around 1,000 Argentine troops, most of these from the Fifth Motorized Infantry Regiment. A small museum has been set up, in a shed. It contains a number of items which Argentine troops left behind, including an ejector seat. Pinned to the wall is a poem, &quot;Ode to Tumbledown,&quot; which was written by an anonymous Scots Guard.

On 21 May 1982, an RAF Harrier (piloted by Flt Lt Jeffrey Glover RAF) was shot down by a Blowpipe missile (fired by members of the Argentine 601 Commando Company) and taken prisoner. On 26 May 1982, at least four Argentine soldiers were killed and several wounded after another Harrier raid found its mark.

The British SAS had a secret observation post on Many Branch Point, a ridge above Port Howard, which was discovered on 10 June 1982 by an Argentine assault section of the 601 Commando Company. During the ensuing fire fight, Captain Gavin Hamilton was killed, and his Goan signaler, Sergeant Fonseca captured. That night witnessed inaccurate shelling on Port Howard carried out by British frigates. This led to speculation among Argentinian officers that the mission of Hamilton was to act as a forward observer for naval gunfire support. Hamilton&#x27;s grave can still be seen up the hill from Port Howard. The Argentines allowed the Union Flag to be placed on his coffin before burial.

On 15 June 1982, one day after the main Argentine surrender, the garrison surrendered to the Royal Marines of B Coy, 40 Commando and .

===Ownership changes===
In 1986, the farm was bought by Robin and Rodney Lee, who let the local population buy shares. In 2004, it was taken over by Myles and Christopher (Critta) Lee, Robin&#x27;s sons, after the retirement of Rodney Lee.

There is one listed building here, the Mount Rosalie Dip.

<doc id="817481" wikidata="Q5790028" url="?curid=817481" title="Khaled bin Ouda bin Mohammed al-Harbi">
<text>Khaled bin Ouda bin Mohammed al-Harbi, (, &quot;Khālid bin ‘Ūdah bin Muḥammad al-Ḥarbī&quot;) (born 1963) is a Saudi national who was associated with Osama bin Laden&#x27;s mujahadeen group in the 1980s, and is thought to have rejoined bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the mid-1990s. Also known as Abu Suleiman al-Makki (Arabic: ابوسليمان المكي), he has a thick beard and requires the use of a wheelchair.

The BBC reports that Al-Harbi was Ayman al-Zawahiri&#x27;s son-in-law.

==Fighting for Islam==
Al-Harbi volunteered to fight against the Soviet invaders of Afghanistan during the 1980s.

According to the website Global Terror Alert, Al-Harbi volunteered to fight in Bosnia in 1992. Al-Harbi lost the use of his legs during a skirmish in Bosnia.

== Bosnia==
Following their successful war of liberation, in 1995, the new Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina offered citizenship to all foreign volunteers who had fought on their behalf.

Al-Harbi settled in Bosnia until 1997, when arrest warrants were issued against him and 18 other men, alleging that they had provided a safehouse for terrorists.

Al-Harbi disappeared from the time his arrest warrant was issued and his appearance in a video taped in late 2001 where he had an extended conversation with Osama bin Laden.

==Appearance with bin Laden==
The U.S. Department of Defense released a videotape on December 13, 2001, showing Osama bin Laden having an extended conversation with an old acquaintance about the September 11 attacks.
Initially bin Laden&#x27;s friend&#x27;s identity was unidentified. 
Commentators speculated that the unknown friend was an important al Qaeda financier, because he did not rise when bin Laden entered the room.
By December 16, 2001 Al Harbi had been identified.

&quot;Time magazine&quot; reported that unidentified U.S. officials described al Harbi as being &quot;a confidant and spiritual sounding board for bin Laden,&quot; but not an al Qaeda member.&quot;
&quot;Time&quot; reported that Nawaf Obaid, who they identified as a Saudi security analyst, said al-Harbi is cooperating. Obaid called al-Harbi a &quot;very successful recruiter&quot;.

In the tape, Khaled al-Harbi states that the tape was being made at the arrangement of the brothers who support al Qaida:
:&quot;&quot;We don&#x27;t want to take much of your time, but this is the arrangement of the brothers. People are now supporting us more, even those ones who did not support us in the past, support us now. I did not want to take that much of your time.&quot;

In the tape, Khaled al-Harbi states that he and those with him began wondering why they had not heard news of the attacks, and then they got the news and celebrated.

The introduction to the translation states that the tape was made in mid-November 2001 in Afghanistan. The U.S. bombing of Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001.

==Amnesty and surrender==
Afterwards, Al-Harbi lived in hiding along the Iranian-Afghani border.

Al-Harbi surrendered himself to the Saudi Arabian embassy in Iran on July 13, 2004.
His surrender was part of a one-month amnesty offer by the Saudi government on June 23, 2004;
Some commentators speculated that Al-Harbi was not eligible for the amnesty, arguing that it applied only to those who committed attacks inside Saudi Arabia.

<doc id="817494" wikidata="Q1055216" url="?curid=817494" title="San Carlos, Falkland Islands">
<text>San Carlos is a settlement in northwestern East Falkland, lying south of Port San Carlos on San Carlos Water. It is sometimes nicknamed &quot;JB&quot; after a former owner, Jack Bonner.
The settlement consists of a number of properties including a dwelling with a small cafe which also provides craft facilities. As noted in the history section, there is a small museum that pays homage to the Falklands Conflict as well as local nature and culture.

==History==
The settlement is named after the ship &quot;San Carlos&quot;, which visited in May 1768. San Carlos grew in the early twentieth century around a factory which froze sheep carcasses.

In 1982 San Carlos was the main British Army bridgehead during the Falklands War, when it was codenamed &quot;Blue Beach&quot;.

A museum and the Blue Beach Military Cemetery at San Carlos commemorate that period.

<text>The lieutenant governor of Hawaii () is the assistant chief executive of the U.S. state of Hawaii and its various agencies and departments, as provided in the Article V, Sections 2 though 6 of the Constitution of Hawaii. Elected by popular suffrage of residents of the state on the same ticket as the governor of Hawaii, the officeholder is concurrently the secretary of State of Hawaii.

The officeholder becomes acting governor of Hawaii if the governor becomes disabled from duty. Historically, Hawaii lieutenant governors were members of either the Hawaii Democratic Party or Hawaii Republican Party. Four have gone on to become governor of Hawaii: George Ariyoshi, Ben Cayetano, John D. Waiheʻe III, and Josh Green.

==Qualifications==
The lieutenant governor of Hawaii is limited to two four-year terms. Inauguration takes place on the first Monday in December following a gubernatorial election. A single term ends at noon four years later. The lieutenant governor must be thirty years old and be a resident of Hawaii for five consecutive years previous to election. Unlike some other states, the office of Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii is a full-time position and requires that the lieutenant governor be barred from other professions or paid positions during the term.

<text>The Battle of [[Cropredy Bridge]] was fought on Saturday 29 June 1644 (9 July 1644 Gregorian) near Banbury, Oxfordshire during the First English Civil War. In the engagement, Sir William Waller and the Parliamentarian army failed to capture King Charles.

The site was placed on the Register of Historic Battlefields maintained by Historic England in 1995.

==Background==
In the early part of 1644, the Royalists suffered several setbacks. Two field armies were defeated at Nantwich and Cheriton, and a Scottish Covenanter army invaded the north of England, driving the Royalists to York, where they were besieged.

King Charles held a council of war in Oxford, his wartime capital, between 25 April and 5 May. It was agreed that while the King remained on the defensive in Oxford, protected by several outlying fortified towns, his nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine (the famous Royalist field commander) would proceed to retrieve the situation in the north. The military command of the forces that remained with King Charles fell to Lord General Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth.

==Campaign==
After Rupert departed, the King&#x27;s council changed this policy. To find reinforcements for the West Country where Rupert&#x27;s brother Prince Maurice was besieging Lyme Regis, they ordered the fortress of Reading, in Berkshire, to be abandoned. This released 2,500 foot soldiers for service elsewhere, but it also allowed the Parliamentarian armies of the Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller to concentrate against Oxford. On 19 May, they began advancing toward Oxford from Reading. On 25 May, the Royalists abandoned Abingdon in the face of Essex&#x27;s advance. Essex occupied the town and then crossed the Thames to capture bridges over the River Cherwell north of Oxford, while Waller passed south of Oxford to capture a crossing over the Thames to the west at Newbridge.

Charles was in imminent danger of being surrounded and besieged in Oxford. As the city was short of provisions, he would soon be forced to surrender. On 3 June, Charles made a feint towards Abingdon to induce Waller to draw back, and then marched westward at night towards Worcester with a force mainly composed of cavalry. With Essex and Waller in pursuit, he was still in danger, but on 7 June, the two Parliamentarian generals (who disliked each other) conferred at Stow on the Wold, and agreed that Essex would march westward to relieve the siege of Lyme Regis, while Waller shadowed the King.

This allowed the King to make another feint, which convinced Waller he was about to march northward, and then move back south by carrying his foot soldiers down the Avon in commandeered boats, so as to return to Oxford and collect reinforcements. Waller, having failed to intercept the King, went to Gloucester for provisions. On 24 June, he marched from Gloucester to Stow on the Wold, where he received intelligence that the King was marching eastward from Oxford into the Parliamentarian-held eastern counties, and soon received orders from the Parliamentarian Committee of Both Kingdoms to pursue him. By 27 June, Waller had reached Hanwell Castle on high ground to the west of the Cherwell, the King being just away in Edgecote. On 28 June, the King moved to Banbury. He was resolved to offer battle, but Waller held the advantageous position.

==Battle==
On Saturday, 29 June, Charles&#x27;s army began marching north along the east side of the River Cherwell. Waller&#x27;s forces proceeded to shadow the King&#x27;s movements on the other side of the river, the two armies little more than a mile apart and in sight of each other, but neither prepared to cross under the fire of enemy guns.

As they approached Cropredy, Charles ordered a small detachment of dragoons to seize the bridge over the Cherwell. At this point, he received a warning that 300 additional horsemen were approaching from the north to join Waller&#x27;s army, and he ordered his army to hasten its march to cut off this detachment. The Royalist army became strung out. The vanguard and main body had crossed a stream at Hay&#x27;s Bridge (near the present-day village of Chipping Warden), leaving a rearguard of only two cavalry brigades under the Earl of Cleveland and the twenty-year-old Earl of Northampton, with some infantry, south of Hay&#x27;s Bridge.

Waller, seeing his opportunity, sent Lieutenant General John Middleton across Cropredy Bridge with two regiments of horse (those of Sir Arthur Haselrig and Colonel Jonas Vandruske) and nine companies of foot to isolate the Royalist rearguard, while he himself led 1,000 men across Slat Mill Ford, a mile to the south of the bridge, to catch the Royalist rear in a pincer movement.

The Royalist dragoons holding Cropredy Bridge were soon overpowered. As Middleton&#x27;s force streamed towards Hay&#x27;s Bridge, they became strung out and vulnerable. At Hay&#x27;s Bridge, Middleton&#x27;s cavalry was checked by Royalist musketeers who had overturned a carriage to block the bridge, while the Earl of Cleveland charged the Parliamentarian foot and artillery behind them. Meanwhile, Northampton&#x27;s brigade charged downhill against Waller&#x27;s men, and forced them back across the Slat Mill Ford.

The King was alerted that his rearguard was engaged, and ordered his army to turn about. He also sent his own lifeguard of horse under Lord Bernard Stewart back across Hay&#x27;s Bridge to aid Cleveland. With their help, Cleveland made a second charge which forced Middleton back across Cropredy Bridge, abandoning eleven guns. Waller&#x27;s major general of ordnance, Sir James Wemyss, was also captured.

The bridge itself was held by two Parliamentarian regiments of foot, Colonel Ralph Weldon&#x27;s Kentish Regiment and the Tower Hamlets Trained Bands regiment. The Royalists tried to recapture the bridge but were repulsed. Waller&#x27;s remaining artillery continued to fire from their vantage point on Bourton Hill, forcing the Cavaliers to fall back from the river.

==Aftermath==
By evening, the two armies still faced each other across the River Cherwell. Charles took opportunity in the lull to dispatch his secretary of war, Sir Edward Walker, to parley with Waller with a message of grace and pardon, but the Parliamentarian replied that he had no power to treat.

At length, after receiving further intelligence of additional Parliamentarians nearby, and as the king&#x27;s train was low in food and supplies, the Royalists slipped away under the cover of night, taking the guns captured from Waller with them. While the Royalists had suffered few casualties, Waller had lost 700 men, many having deserted immediately after the battle.

Waller&#x27;s army shortly became demoralised, and immobilised by desertions and mutinies by men unwilling to serve far from their homes, chiefly those drawn from London. Charles could afford to ignore Waller and march into the West Country after Essex, forcing Essex&#x27;s army to surrender at Lostwithiel.

==Music==
The song Red and Gold by (written by Ralph McTell for Fairport Convention, whose annual music festival is held on the outskirts of Cropredy) relates the story of the battle as told by a non-combatant. Versions of the song by various artists exist.

<text>Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš (; – 1 March 1921) was the last monarch of Montenegro from 1860 to 1918, reigning as prince from 1860 to 1910 and as the country&#x27;s first and only king from 1910 to 1918. His grandsons were kings Alexander I of Yugoslavia, Umberto II of Italy, and Sergei Georgievich among others.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nikola was born in the village of Njeguši, the home of the reigning House of Petrović. He was the son of Mirko Petrović-Njegoš, a celebrated Montenegrin warrior (an elder brother to Danilo I of Montenegro) and his wife, Anastasija Martinovich (1824–1895). After 1696, when the dignity of vladika, or prince-bishop, became hereditary in the Petrović family, the sovereign power had descended from uncle to nephew, the vladikas belonging to the order of the black clergy (i.e., monastic clergy) who are forbidden to marry. A change was introduced by Danilo I, who declined the episcopal office, married and declared the principality hereditary in the direct male line. Mirko Petrović-Njegoš having renounced his claim to the throne, his son was nominated heir-presumptive, and the old system of succession was thus incidentally continued.

Prince Nikola, who had been trained from infancy in martial and athletic exercises, spent a portion of his early boyhood in Trieste at the household of the Kustic family, to which his aunt, the princess Darinka, wife of Danilo II, belonged. The princess was an ardent francophile, and at her suggestion, the young heir-presumptive of the vladikas was sent to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. Unlike his contemporary, King Milan of Serbia, Prince Nikola was little influenced in his tastes and habits by his Parisian education; the young highlander, whose keen patriotism, capability for leadership and poetic talents early displayed themselves, showed no inclination for the pleasures of the French capital, and eagerly looked forward to returning to his native land.

Nikola was a member of the &quot;United Serbian Youth&quot; (Уједињена омладина српска) during its existence (1866–1871). After the organization was prohibited in the Principality of Serbia and Austro-Hungary, the &quot;Association for Serb Liberation and Unification&quot; (Дружина за ослобођење и уједињење српско) was established by Nikola, Marko Popović, Simo Popović, Mašo Vrbica, Vasa Pelagić, and more, in Cetinje (1871).

Nicholas I of Montenegro was also reflected in literature. His most significant works are the Serb patriotic song &quot;Onamo, &#x27;namo!&quot; (There, over there!), and the drama &quot;Empress of the Balkan&quot;.

===Prince of Montenegro===

While still in Paris, Nikola succeeded his assassinated uncle Danilo I as prince (13 August 1860). At age 19, in Cetinje, on 8 November 1860, he married Milena, 13 years old, daughter of a Vojvoda named Petar Vukotić and wife Jelena Vojvodić.

In the period of peace which followed Nikola carried out a series of military, administrative and educational reforms. The country was embroiled in a series of wars with the Ottoman Empire between 1862 and 1878. In 1867 he met the emperor Napoleon III at Paris, and in 1868 he undertook a journey to Russia, where he received an affectionate welcome from the tsar, Alexander II in St Petersburg. Being a champion of Orthodoxy, Russia provided military missions and supplies to Montenegro. He afterwards visited the courts of Berlin and Vienna. His efforts to enlist the sympathies of the Russian imperial family produced important results for Montenegro; considerable subsidies were granted by the tsar and tsaritsa for educational and other purposes, and supplies of arms and ammunition were sent to Cetinje. In 1871 Prince Dolgorukov arrived at Montenegro on a special mission from the tsar, and distributed large sums of money among the people. In 1869 Prince Nikola, whose authority was now firmly established, succeeded in preventing the impetuous highlanders from aiding the Krivošijans in their revolt against the Austrian government; similarly in 1897 he checked the martial excitement caused by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War.
In 1876 Nikola declared war against Turkey; his military reputation was enhanced by the ensuing campaign, and still more by that of 1877/78, during which he captured Nikšić, Bar and Ulcinj. The war resulted in a considerable extension of the Montenegrin frontier and the acquisition of a seaboard on the Adriatic. Nikola justified the war as a revenge for the Battle of Kosovo (1389). In 1876 he sent a message to the Montenegrins in Herzegovina:
:&quot;Under Murad I the Serbian Empire was destroyed, under Murad V it has to rise again. This is my wish and wish of all of us as well as the wish of almighty God&quot;.

The Congress of Berlin in 1878 recognised the independence of Montenegro, and in the succeeding decades Montenegro enjoyed considerable prosperity and stability. Education, communications and the army expanded greatly (the latter with support from Imperial Russia). In 1883 Prince Nikola visited the sultan, with whom he subsequently maintained the most cordial relations; in 1896 he celebrated the bicentenary of the Petrović dynasty, and in the same year he attended the coronation of Nicholas II; in May 1898 he visited Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle.

===King of Montenegro===
In 1900 Nikola took the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

According to Bolati, the Montenegrin court was not grieving that much over the murder of King Alexander Obrenović, as they saw him as an enemy of Montenegro and obstacle to the unification of Serb Lands. &quot;Although it wasn&#x27;t said openly, it was thought that the Petrović dynasty would achieve [the unification]. All procedures of King Nikola shows that he himself believed that&quot;.

He gave Montenegro its first constitution in 1905 following pressure from a population eager for more freedom. He also introduced west-European style press freedom and criminal law codes. In 1906, he introduced Montenegrin currency, the perper. On 28 August 1910, during the celebration of his jubilee, he assumed the title of king, in accordance with a petition from the Skupština. 
He was at the same time gazetted field-marshal in the Russian army, an honor never previously conferred on any foreigner except the Duke of Wellington. When the Balkan Wars broke out in 1912 King Nikola was one of the most enthusiastic of the allies. He wanted to drive the Ottomans completely out of Europe. He defied the Concert of Europe and captured Scutari after a siege, despite the fact that they blockaded the whole coast of Montenegro. Again in the Great War which began in 1914 he was the first to go to Serbia&#x27;s aid to repel the Austro-Hungarian forces from the Balkan Peninsula.

In January 1916, after the defeat of Serbia, Montenegro was also conquered by Austria-Hungary, and the King fled to Italy and then to France. The government transferred its operations to Bordeaux. After the end of the First World War, a meeting in Podgorica voted to depose Nikola and annex Montenegro to Serbia. A few days later, Serbia (including Montenegro) merged with the former South Slav territories of Austria-Hungary to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. Nikola, who was in exile in France, continued to claim the throne until his death in Antibes in 1921. He was buried in Italy. In 1989, the remains of Nikola, his queen Milena, and two of their twelve children were re-buried in Montenegro.

==Issue==

Five of Nicholas I&#x27;s daughters were married, each to princes and kings, giving Nicholas the nickname &quot;the father-in-law of Europe&quot;. Nicholas shared this sobriquet with his contemporary Christian IX, King of Denmark. Christian IX&#x27;s children also married members of European royalty from multiple countries.

The pretender to Nicholas I&#x27;s throne is his great-grandson Nicholas, Crown Prince of Montenegro, son of Michael, Prince of Montenegro.

* King Nikola and the Kingdom of Montenegro are remembered briefly in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, where its eponymous main character reminisces on how for his accomplishments and heroic endeavors during the First World War the King confers unto him the highest honor of the Kingdom, the &quot;Orderi di Danilo&quot;. Gatsby duly presents the medal for his guest to examine which reads on the legend &quot;Montenegro, Nicolas Rex&quot; and on its reverse: &quot;Major Jay Gatsby - For Valour Extraordinary&quot;.
* The character of the King in Maurice Chevalier&#x27;s movie &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1934) is based on Nicholas.

<text>Tommy Boy is a 1995 American buddy comedy film directed by Peter Segal, written by Bonnie and Terry Turner, produced by Lorne Michaels, and starring soon-to-be former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; castmates and close friends Chris Farley and David Spade. The first of many films that Segal has filmed with former &quot;SNL&quot; castmates, it tells the story of a socially and emotionally immature man (Farley) who learns lessons about friendship and self-worth, following the sudden death of his industrialist father.

Shot primarily in Toronto and Los Angeles under the working title &quot;Rocky Road&quot;, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial disappointment, grossing $32.7 million on a budget of $20 million. Since its release, however, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; has become a cult film and also been successful on home video.

==Plot==
After seven years at college, friendly but dim-witted Tommy Callahan III barely graduates from Marquette University and returns to his hometown of Sandusky, Ohio. His father, widowed industrialist Thomas R. &quot;Big Tom&quot; Callahan Jr., gives him an executive job at the family&#x27;s auto parts plant, Callahan Auto, and reveals he will marry Beverly Barrish-Burns, whom he had met at a fat farm, with her son Paul effectively becoming Tommy&#x27;s new stepbrother. However, Big Tom suddenly suffers a fatal heart attack during the wedding reception. After the funeral, doubting the company will survive without Big Tom, the bank reneges on promises of a loan for a new brake pad division, requiring that the company&#x27;s debts be resolved immediately. Tommy suggests that he will let the bank hold his few inherited shares and house in exchange for the bank giving time to sell 500,000 brake pads to prove the new division&#x27;s viability; if he succeeds, the bank will underwrite the venture. Tommy then sets out on a cross-country sales trip with Big Tom&#x27;s sardonic and sycophantic assistant Richard Hayden, a childhood acquaintance who is particularly antagonistic towards Tommy.

Meanwhile, sales manager Michelle Brock, a high school classmate of Tommy&#x27;s, notices Beverly and Paul kissing romantically; they reveal themselves as married con artists with criminal records. Instead of eventually suing for divorce and taking half of Big Tom&#x27;s estate, Beverly has inherited a controlling interest in the company. To convert that into cash, she seeks a quick sale to self-described &quot;auto parts king&quot; Ray Zalinsky, owner and operator of rival automotive parts company Zalinsky Auto Parts in Chicago.

On the road, Tommy&#x27;s social anxiety and hyperactivity alienate several potential buyers. The lack of any progress leads to tension between Tommy and Richard, culminating in the near destruction of Richard’s car and a fistfight. However, after witnessing Tommy persuade a surly waitress to serve him at a restaurant after the kitchen has closed, Richard suggests he use his skill at reading people to make sales. The two reconcile and quickly reach their sales goal.

However, Paul sabotages the company&#x27;s computers, causing sales posted by Michelle to be either lost or rerouted. With half of the sales now canceled, the bank (now backed by Beverly and Paul) decides to sell Callahan Auto to Zalinsky. Hoping to persuade Zalinsky to reconsider, Tommy and Richard board a plane to Chicago posing as flight attendants. In Chicago, they briefly meet with Zalinsky, but he tells them he desires the reputation connected with the Callahan brand, planning to shutter the company and lay off its workers, which, in turn, would financially ruin the town.

Tommy and Richard are denied entrance to the Zalinsky board room since Tommy has no standing. As they wallow on the curb in self-pity, Michelle quickly arrives with Paul and Beverly&#x27;s police records. Tommy devises a plan: dressed as a suicide bomber by using road flares, he attracts the attention of a live television news crew and, along with Michelle and Richard, forces his way back into the board room. Back in Sandusky, Callahan workers watch the drama on television. In a final move of pure persuasion, Tommy quotes Zalinsky&#x27;s own advertising slogan, claiming he stands for the &quot;American working man.&quot; As the television audience watches, Zalinsky signs Tommy&#x27;s purchase order for 500,000 brake pads. Although Zalinsky nullifies the purchase order as he will soon own Callahan Auto, Michelle arrives with Paul&#x27;s police records, which include outstanding warrants for fraud. Since Beverly is still married to Paul, her marriage to Big Tom was bigamous and therefore never legal. Thus, all of Big Tom&#x27;s controlling shares actually belong to Tommy, the rightful heir. Since Tommy does not want to sell the shares, the deal with Zalinsky is off, and since Tommy still holds Zalinsky&#x27;s purchase order, the company is saved. Paul attempts to flee, but accidentally triggers a crash test mechanism that subdues him, and he is subsequently arrested. Zalinsky admits defeat, honoring the sales order, and invites Beverly to dinner. Back in Sandusky, Tommy gives a speech at the plant saying he will take his presidency of Callahan Auto seriously to keep the workers steadily employed.

Sailing in his dinghy on a lake, Tommy tells his father&#x27;s spirit he will continue his legacy at Callahan and says he must go ashore to have dinner with Michelle and her family, having ignited a relationship with her.

==Release==
===Home media===

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Tommy Boy&quot; opened on March 31, 1995, and grossed $8 million in its opening weekend, finishing first at the box office. The film had a total box office gross of $32.7 million.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Tommy Boy&quot; received mixed reviews from critics upon its release. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 39% approval rating, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though it benefits from the comic charms of its two leads, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; too often feels like a familiar sketch stretched thin.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100, based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;sweet natured&quot; and a &quot;good belly laugh of a movie&quot;. Brian Webster of the Online Film Critics Society also received the film positively, saying that the film would please Farley fans. Dan Marcucci and Nancy Serougi of the &quot;Broomfield Enterprise&quot; said the film was &quot;Farley at his best&quot;, and Scott Weinberg of DVDTalk.com said that it was &quot;pretty damn funny&quot;. In the 2015 film &quot;I Am Chris Farley&quot;, many of his fellow &quot;SNL&quot; peers praised Farley&#x27;s performance; Dan Aykroyd stated that the movie showcased Farley&#x27;s quality and range as an actor, while Jay Mohr noted that audiences were able to see Farley&#x27;s sensitive and vulnerable side.

Among the negative reviews, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert only gave the film one star out of four, writing that: &quot;&quot;Tommy Boy&quot; is one of those movies that plays like an explosion down at the screenplay factory. You can almost picture a bewildered office boy, his face smudged with soot, wandering through the ruins and rescuing pages at random. Too bad they didn&#x27;t mail them to the insurance company instead of filming them.&quot; The film is on Ebert&#x27;s &quot;Most Hated&quot; list. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;the very poor cousin of a dopey Jim Carrey movie&quot;. Owen Gleiberman graded the film a &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale, and Ken Hanke of &quot;Mountain Xpress&quot; said that it was a &quot;Passably funny star vehicle. Nothing great.&quot;

Bo Derek was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.

==Dedication==
&quot;Tommy Boy&quot; and the 1994 horror film &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; are dedicated to Gregg Fonseca (1952–1994), who died eight months before the release of &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;. While Fonseca did not work on either film, he served as production designer on the first two &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; films, as well as &quot;Coneheads&quot; and both &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; films which, like &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;, were produced by Lorne Michaels.

<doc id="817525" wikidata="Q319043" url="?curid=817525" title="John Hyrcanus">
<text>John Hyrcanus (; ; ) was a Hasmonean (Maccabean) leader and Jewish High Priest of Israel of the 2nd century BCE (born 164 BCE, reigned from 134 BCE until he died in 104 BCE). In rabbinic literature he is often referred to as &quot;Yoḥanan Cohen Gadol&quot; (), &quot;John the High Priest&quot;.

==Name==
Josephus explains in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; that John was also known as &quot;Hyrcanus&quot; but does not explain the reason behind this name. The only other primary sources—the Books of the Maccabees—never used this name for John. The single occurrence of the name &quot;Hyrcanus&quot; in 2 Maccabees 3:11 refers to a man to whom some of the money in the Temple belonged during the c. 178 BCE visit of Heliodorus.

The reason for the name is disputed amongst biblical scholars, with a variety of reasons proposed:
* Familial origin in the region of Hyrcania on the Caspian Sea
* A Greek regnal name, which would have represented closer ties with the Hellenistic culture against which the Maccabees had revolted under Seleucid rule. However, the region of Hyrcania had been conquered by Mithridates I of Parthia in 141–139 BCE
* Given the name by the Seleucids after he fought in the region alongside Antiochus VII Sidetes against Phraates II of Parthia in 130–129 BCE, a campaign which resulted in the release of Antiochus&#x27; brother Demetrius II Nicator from captivity in Hyrcania

==Life and work==
He was the son of Simon Thassi and hence the nephew of Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan Apphus and their siblings, whose story is told in the deuterocanonical books of 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees, in the Talmud, and in Josephus. John was not present at a banquet at which his father and his two brothers were murdered by John&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ptolemy son of Abubus. He attained his father&#x27;s former offices of High Priest and ethnarch, but not king. Josephus said that John Hyrcanus had five sons but he named only four in his histories: Judah Aristobulus I, Antigonus I, Alexander Jannai, and Absalom. It is the fifth brother who is said to have unsuccessfully sought the throne at the death of Aristobulus I according to &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; 13.12.1.

==Siege of Jerusalem==
During the first year of John Hyrcanus&#x27;s reign, he faced a serious challenge to Judean independence from the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus VII Sidetes marched into Judea, pillaged the countryside, and laid what became a year-long siege of Jerusalem. The prolonged siege caused Hyrcanus to remove any Judean from the city who could not assist with the defence effort (Antiquities 13.240). These refugees were not allowed to pass through Antiochus’ lines, becoming trapped in the middle of a chaotic siege. Facing a humanitarian crisis, Hyrcanus re-admitted his estranged Jerusalemites when the festival of Sukkot arrived. Then, as food shortages in Jerusalem became severe, Hyrcanus negotiated a truce with Antiochus.

The terms of the truce required payment of 3,000 talents of silver to Antiochus, the dismantling of the walls of Jerusalem, Judean participation in the Seleucid war against the Parthians, and renewed Judean recognition of Seleucid control (&quot;Antiquities&quot; 13.245). These terms were a harsh blow to Hyrcanus, who had to loot the tomb of David to pay the 3,000 talents ( I 2:5).

==Under Seleucid control (133–128 BCE)==
Following the Seleucid siege, Judea faced tough economic times which were magnified by taxes to the Seleucids enforced by Antiochus. Furthermore, Hyrcanus was forced to accompany Antiochus on his eastern campaign in 130 BCE. Hyrcanus probably functioned as the military commander of a Jewish company in the campaign. It is reported that Antiochus, out of consideration for the religion of his Jewish allies, at one point ordered a two days&#x27; halt of the entire army to allow them to avoid breaking the Sabbath and the festival of Shavuot.

This enforced absence probably caused a loss of support for the inexperienced Hyrcanus among the Judean population. Judeans in the countryside were especially disillusioned with Hyrcanus after Antiochus’ army plundered their land. John Hyrcanus&#x27;s expulsion of the non-military population of Jerusalem during the siege had probably caused resentment, and his looting of the Tomb of David violated his obligations as High Priest, which would have offended the religious leadership.

Therefore, at an early point in his 31-year reign, Hyrcanus had lost support from Judeans in various cultural sectors. The Jerusalemites, the rural Judeans, and the religious leadership probably doubted the future of Judea under Hyrcanus. However in 128 BCE Antiochus VII was killed in battle against Parthia. What followed was an era of conquest led by Hyrcanus that marked the high point of Judea as the most significant power in the Levant.

==Conquests==

John Hyrcanus took advantage of unrest in the Seleucid Empire to reassert Judean independence and acquire new territories. In 130 BCE Demetrius II, the former Seleucid king, returned from exile in Hyrcania to resume the government of his empire. However the transition of power made it difficult for Demetrius to reassert control over Judea., and the Seleucid Empire also lost control of other principalities. The Ituraeans of Lebanon, the Ammonites of the Transjordan, and the Arabian Nabateans were among these. Hyrcanus determined to take advantage of the dissipation of the Seleucid Empire to enlarge the Judean State.

Hyrcanus raised a new mercenary army that differed from the Judean forces that had been defeated by Antiochus VII (Ant.13.249). The Judean population was probably still recovering from the attack of Antiochus, and therefore could not provide enough able men for a new army. The new army was funded with more treasure that Hyrcanus removed from the Tomb of David.

Beginning in 113 BCE, Hyrcanus began an extensive military campaign against Samaria. Hyrcanus placed his sons Antigonus and Aristobulus in charge of the siege of Samaria. The Samaritans called for help and eventually received 6,000 troops from Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. Although the siege lasted for a long, difficult year, Hyrcanus did not give up. Ultimately Samaria was overrun and devastated. Cyzicenus&#x27; mercenary army was defeated and the city of Scythopolis seems to have been occupied by Hyrcanus as well. The inhabitants of Samaria were enslaved. Upon conquering former Seleucid regions Hyrcanus implemented a policy of compelling the non-Jewish populations to adopt Jewish customs.

John Hyrcanus&#x27;s first conquest was an invasion of the Transjordan in 110 BCE. John Hyrcanus&#x27;s mercenary army laid siege to the city of Medeba and took it after a six-month siege. After these victories, Hyrcanus went north towards Shechem and Mount Gerizim. The city of Shechem was reduced to a village and the Samaritan Temple on Mount Gerizim was destroyed. This military action against Shechem has been dated archaeologically around 111–110 BCE. Destroying the Samaritan Temple on Mount Gerizim helped ameliorate John Hyrcanus&#x27;s standing among religious elite and common Jews who detested any temple to God outside of Jerusalem.

Hyrcanus also initiated a military campaign against the Idumeans (Edomites). During this campaign Hyrcanus conquered Adora, Maresha and other Idumean towns (Ant.13.257). Hyrcanus then instituted forced conversions of the Idumeans to Judaism. This was an unprecedented measure for a Judean ruler; it was the first instance of forced conversion perpetrated by Jews in recorded history. However, some scholars dispute the narrative of forced conversion and believe that the Edomites peacefully assimilated in Judean society.

==Economy, foreign relations, and religion==

After the siege of Jerusalem, Hyrcanus faced a serious economic crisis in Judea, although the economic difficulties probably subsided after the death of Antiochus VII, since Hyrcanus no longer had to pay taxes or tributes to a weaker Seleucid Empire. The economic situation eventually improved enough for Hyrcanus to issue his own coinage (see below). On top of that, Hyrcanus initiated vital building projects in Judea. Hyrcanus re-built the walls destroyed by Antiochus. He also built a fortress north of the Temple called the Baris and possibly also the fortress Hyrcania.

Moreover, out of desperation, Hyrcanus sought for good relations with the surrounding Gentile powers, especially the growing Roman Republic. Two decrees were passed in the Roman Senate that established a treaty of friendship with Judea. Although it is difficult to specifically date these resolutions, they represent efforts made between Hyrcanus and Rome to maintain stable relations. Also, an embassy sent by Hyrcanus received Roman confirmation of Hasmonean independence. Hyrcanus was an excellent case of a ruler backed by Roman support.

In addition to Rome, Hyrcanus was able to maintain steady relations with Ptolemaic Egypt. This was probably made possible due to various Jews living in Egypt who had connections with the Ptolemaic Court (Ant. 13.284–287). Finally, the cities of Athens and Pergamon even showed honor to Hyrcanus in an effort to appease Rome.

Furthermore, the minting of coins by Hyrcanus demonstrates John Hyrcanus&#x27;s willingness to delegate power. Sixty-three coins found near Bethlehem bear the inscription, &quot;Yohanan the High Priest.&quot; The reserve side of the coins contains the phrase, &quot;The Assembly of the Jews.&quot; This seems to suggest that during his reign, Hyrcanus was not an absolute ruler. Instead, Hyrcanus had to submit at times to an assembly of Jews that had a certain amount of minority power. The coins lack any depictions of animals or humans. This suggests that Hyrcanus strictly followed the Jewish prohibition against graven images. The coins also seem to suggest that Hyrcanus considered himself to be primarily the High Priest of Judea, and his rule of Judea was shared with the Assembly.

In Judea, religious issues were a core aspect of domestic policy. Josephus only reports one specific conflict between Hyrcanus and the Pharisees, who asked him to relinquish the position of High Priest (Ant. 13.288–296). After this falling-out, Hyrcanus sided with the rivals of the Pharisees, the Sadducees. However, elsewhere Josephus reports that the Pharisees did not grow to power until the reign of Queen Salome Alexandra (JW.1.110) The coins minted under Hyrcanus suggest that Hyrcanus did not have complete secular authority. Furthermore, this account may represent a piece of Pharisaic apologetics due to Josephus&#x27;s Pharisaic background. Regardless, there were probably tensions because of the religious and secular leadership roles held by Hyrcanus.

Ultimately, one of the final acts of John Hyrcanus&#x27;s life was an act that solved any kind of dispute over his role as High Priest and ethnarch. In the will of Hyrcanus, he provisioned for the division of the high priesthood from secular authority. John Hyrcanus&#x27;s widow was given control of civil authority after his death, and his son Judas Aristobulus was given the role of High Priest. This action represented John Hyrcanus&#x27;s willingness to compromise over the issue of secular and religious authority. (However, Aristobulus was not satisfied with this arrangement, so he cast his mother into prison and let her starve.)

The Tomb of Hyrcanus was, according to Josephus, located near the Towers&#x27; Pool (also known as Hezekiah&#x27;s Pool) northwest of the present Jaffa Gate. During the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Titus selected the area opposite the tomb to begin his assault on the city&#x27;s third wall.

==Legacy==
John Hyrcanus the High Priest is remembered in rabbinic literature as having made several outstanding enactments and deeds worthy of memorial, one of which being that he cancelled the requirement of saying the avowal mentioned in Deuteronomy 26:12–15 once in every three years, since he saw that in Israel they had ceased to separate the First Tithe in its proper manner and which, by making the avowal, and saying &quot;I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, and have done according to all that you have commanded me,&quot; he makes himself dishonest before his Maker and liable to God&#x27;s wrath. In his days, the First Tithe, which was meant to be given unto the Levites, was given instead to the priests of Aaron&#x27;s lineage, after Ezra had fined the Levites for not returning in full force to the Land of Israel. By not being able to give the First Tithe unto the Levites, as originally commanded by God, this made the avowal null and void. In addition, John Hyrcanus is remembered for having cancelled the reading of Psalm 44:23, formerly chanted daily by the Levites in the Temple precincts, and which words, &quot;Awake! Why do you sleep, O Lord?, etc.&quot;, seemed inappropriate, as if they were imposing their own will over God&#x27;s, or that God was actually sleeping. In similar fashion, the High Priest cancelled an ill-practice had by the people to cause bleeding near the eyes of sacrificial calves by beating their heads so as to stun them, prior to their being bound and slaughtered, since by beating the animal in such a way they ran the risk of causing a blemish in the animal&#x27;s membrane lining its brain. To prevent this from happening, the High Priest made rings in the ground of the Temple court for helping to secure the animals before slaughter.

Before John Hyrcanus officiated as Israel&#x27;s High Priest, the people had it as a practice to do manual work on the intermediate days of the Jewish holidays, and one could hear in Jerusalem the hammer pounding against the anvil. The High Priest passed an edict restricting such labours on those days, thinking it inappropriate to do servile work on the &quot;Hol ha-Moed&quot;, until after the Feast (&quot;Yom Tov&quot;). It had also been a custom in Israel, since the days that the Hasmoneans defeated the Grecians who prevented them from mentioning the name of God in heaven, to inscribe the name of God in their ordinary contracts, bills of sale and promissory notes. They would write, for example, &quot;In the year such and such of Yohanan, the High Priest of the Most High God.&quot; But when the Sages of Israel became sensible of the fact that such ordinary contracts were often discarded in the rubbish after reimbursement, it was deemed improper to show disrespect to God&#x27;s name by doing so. Therefore, on the 3rd day of the lunar month Tishri, the practice of writing God&#x27;s name in ordinary contracts was cancelled altogether, while the date of such cancellation was declared a day of rejoicing, and inscribed in the Scroll of Fasting.

The Mishnah (&quot;Parah&quot; 3:4[5]) also relates that during the tenure of John Hyrcanus as High Priesthood, he had prepared the ashes of two Red heifers used in purifying those who had contracted corpse uncleanness.

In what is seen as yet another one of John Hyrcanus&#x27;s accomplishments, during his days any commoner or rustic could be trusted in what concerns &quot;Demai&quot;-produce (that is, if a doubt arose over whether or not such produce bought from him had been correctly divested of its tithes), since even the common folk in Israel were careful to separate the &quot;Terumah&quot;-offering given to the priests. Still, such produce required its buyer to separate the First and Second Tithes. Some view this as also being a discredit unto the High Priest, seeing that the commoners refused to separate these latter tithes because of being intimidated by bullies, who took these tithes from the public treasuries by force, while John Hyrcanus refused to censure such bad conduct.

In the later years of his life, John Hyrcanus abandoned the sect of the Pharisees and joined the Sadducees. This prompted the famous rabbinic dictum: &quot;Do not believe in yourself until your dying day.&quot; At his death, a monument () was built in his honour and where his bones were interred. The monument was located in what was outside the walls of the city at that time, but by Josephus&#x27; time was between the second and third walls of Jerusalem, and where the Romans had built a bank of earthworks to break into the newer third wall encompassing the upper city, directly opposite John&#x27;s monument.

<text>Peter Michael Blau (February 7, 1918 – March 12, 2002) was an Austrian and American sociologist and theorist. Born in Vienna, Austria, he immigrated to the United States in 1939. He completed his PhD doctoral thesis with Robert K. Merton at Columbia University in 1952, laying an early theory for the dynamics of bureaucracy. The next year, he was offered a professorship at the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1953 to 1970. He also taught as Pitt Professor at Cambridge University in Great Britain, as a senior fellow at King&#x27;s College, and as a Distinguished Honorary professor at Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences which he helped to establish. In 1970 he returned to Columbia University, where he was awarded the lifetime position of professor emeritus. From 1988 to 2000 he taught as the Robert Broughton Distinguished Research Professor at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in the same department as his wife, Judith Blau, while continuing to commute to New York to meet with graduate students and colleagues.

His sociological specialty was in organizational and social structures. He formulated theories relating to many aspects of social phenomena, including upward mobility, occupational opportunity, and heterogeneity. From each of his theories, he deduced an hypothesis which he would test against large scale empirical research. He was one of the first sociological theorists to use high level statistics to develop sociology as a scientific discipline using macro-level empirical data to gird theory. He also produced theories on how population structures can influence human behavior.

One of Blau&#x27;s most important contributions to social theory is his work regarding exchange theory, which explains how small-scale social exchange directly relates to social structures at a societal level.

He also was the first to map out the wide variety of social forces, dubbed &quot;Blau space&quot; by Miller McPherson. This idea was one of the first to take individuals and distribute them along a multidimensional space. Blau-space is still used as a guide by sociologists and has been expanded to include areas of sociology never specifically covered by Blau himself.

In 1974 Blau served as the 65th president of the American Sociological Association.

==Early life and family background==
Peter Blau was born in 1918 in Vienna, a few months before the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed. He was raised in a Jewish family as fascist power within Europe grew and Hitler&#x27;s influence within Austria became increasingly evident. At the age of seventeen, Blau was convicted of high treason for speaking out against government repression in articles he wrote for an underground newspaper of the Social Democratic Worker&#x27;s Party and was subsequently incarcerated. Blau was given a ten-year sentence in the federal prison in Vienna. He was then released shortly after his imprisonment when the ban on political activity was lifted due to the National Socialists&#x27; rise to power. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria, Blau attempted to escape to Czechoslovakia on March 13, 1938. Both Blau and his sister—who was sent to England—managed to escape. The rest of his family, however, decided to stay in Austria. Blau&#x27;s original attempt to flee proved unsuccessful as he was captured by Nazi border patrol and was imprisoned for two months. During the two months he was detained, he was tortured, starved, and was forced to eat only lard. Yet, he was once again released and made his way to Prague. When Hitler occupied Czechoslovakia, he escaped again, returning illegally to Vienna to visit one more time with his parents. In the dark of night, Blau hid on a train to cross the border into France. There he turned himself in to the Allied forces, who had not yet reversed their policy of putting anyone with a German passport—even the Jews—into labor camps. He spent several weeks as a POW of France crushing grapes in Bordeaux. When the policy about Jews was reversed, he was able to continue his journey to Le Havre, France where he received a refugee scholarship to Elmhurst College in Illinois through a group of missionaries studying at the theological seminary. Blau emigrated to America on the Degrasse ship and landed in New York on January 1, 1939. He later attended Elmhurst College, earning his degree in sociology in 1942, and becoming a United States citizen in 1943. Blau returned to Europe 1942 as a member of the United States Army, acting as an interrogator given his skills in the German language and was awarded the bronze star for his duties. It was during this time that Blau also received word that his family had been killed at Auschwitz.

==Later life==
After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Elmhurst College, Blau continued his education at Columbia University, where he received his PhD in 1952. One of Blau&#x27;s most memorable and significant contributions to the field of sociology came in 1967. Working together with Otis Dudley Duncan and Andrea Tyree, he co-authored &quot;The American Occupational Structure&quot;, which provided a meaningful sociological contribution to the study of social stratification, and won the highly touted Sorokin Award from the American Sociological Association in 1968. Blau is also known for his contributions to sociological theory. &quot;Exchange and Power in Social Life&quot; (1964) was an important contribution to contemporary exchange theory, one of Blau&#x27;s distinguished theoretical orientations. The aim of this work was &quot;(to analyze) the processes that govern the associations among men as a prolegomenon of a theory of social structure&quot;. In it, Blau makes the effort to take micro-level exchange theory and apply it to social structures at a macro-level. Blau was also very active in the study of structural theory. Blau&#x27;s 1977 book, &quot;Inequality and Heterogeneity&quot;, presents &quot;a macro sociological theory of social structure&quot; where the foundation of his theory &quot;is a quantitative conception of social structure in terms of the distributions of people among social positions that affect their social relations&quot;.

Blau received notable distinctions for his achievements, which include: election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He also served as the president of the American Sociological Association from 1973 to 1974. He died on March 12, 2002, of acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was eighty-four years old.

==Theory==
For Blau, sociological theories were produced through logical deduction. Blau began theoretical studies by making a broad statement or basic assumption regarding the social world, which was then proven by the logical predictions it produced. Blau claimed these statements could not be validated or refuted based on one empirical test. Instead, it was a theory&#x27;s &quot;logical implications&quot; that could be trusted, more so than an empirical test. Only if continued empirical tests contradicted the theory could the theory be modified, or dropped entirely if a new theory was proposed in its place. Blau&#x27;s trust in logic and his deductive approach to social theory aligns him closely with the philosophy of positivism and traditional French sociologists, Auguste Comte and Émile Durkheim. Blau also focused his sociological theory on both the micro and macro level, and often connected the two throughout his research.

===Population structures===
Population structures and their relationship with social interaction was another primary interest within Blau&#x27;s work. Blau believed that population structure created guidelines for specific human behaviors, especially intergroup relations. Blau created a number of theories explaining aspects of population structure that increased chances of intergroup relations. Blau viewed social structure as being somewhat stable, but he did identify two phenomena that he believed contributed to structural change within a population: social mobility and conflict. Blau thought social mobility, which he described as &quot;any movement within a population by an individual,&quot; was beneficial to intergroup relations within a population structure, and theorized various scenarios involving social relations and mobility. Blau also theorized explanations for structural causes of conflict, focusing on population distribution as a cause of conflict separate from individual or political issues. According to Blau, structural conflict is linked to the inequality of status of groups, size of group, social mobility between groups, and the probability of social contact between groups. Blau determined that prevention of conflict within a population structure can be achieved through &quot;multi-group affiliations and intersection in complex societies&quot;.

=== Social exchange theory ===
Social exchange provides an explanation of the interactions and relationships Blau observed while researching. He believed that social exchange could reflect behavior oriented to socially mediated goals. Peter started from the premise that social interaction has value to people, and he explored the forms and sources of this value in order to understand collective outcomes, such as the distribution of power in a society. People engage in social interactions in which we would not think deep about, but Blau suggested it is for the same reason why people engage in economic transactions. They need something from other people, the exchange. That then leads to an increase in social exchange in which people attempt to stay out of debt because it gives them an advantage, as well as potential power. Although social exchange can be genuine, when the goal for the individual to stay out of debt or to get something in return, it is selfishness. &quot;The tendency to help others is frequently motivated by the expectation that doing so will bring social rewards&quot; Blau explained that social exchange between individuals either stem from inherent rewards (things such as love or admiration) or external rewards (money, etc.). Blau expressed the difference between social exchange and the purchasing of goods, stating that there is an emotional component within social exchange that is nonexistent in everyday transactions.

Blau also studied the social exchange that occurs within relationships. He believed that most thriving friendships occur when both participants are the same status level, allowing for an equal potential for exchange and benefit throughout the relationship. He also studied the social exchange of partners, and how these relationships come together in the first place. Blau explains how loving relationships come to existence through the exchange of certain favorable traits that would attract one person to another. Blau discusses how status, beauty, and wealth are some of the key characteristics that people search for in a partner, and that the most successful relationships occur when both partners have valuable attributes that they can benefit from.

===Organizational theory===
Some of Blau&#x27;s first major contributions to sociology were in the field of organizations. His first publication, &quot;Dynamics of Bureaucracy&quot; (1955), prompted a wave of post-Weberian organizational studies. Organizational research consisted in exploring to what extent the received image of the Weberian bureaucracy—an efficient, mechanical system of roles—held up under close scrutiny in the empirical study of social interaction within organizations. Blau, in his research and study, highlighted the ways in which the real life of the organization was structured along informal channels of interaction and socio-emotional exchange. Blau conducted a different approach in the main subject group for organizational sociology, focusing far more on white-collar workers rather than those of the blue-collar status, concentrating on the relationships between workers. He also discussed how the incipient status systems formed were important to the continued functioning of these organizations as the formal status structure. Hence, much of Blau&#x27;s work involving organizations centered on the interplay between formal structure, informal practices, and bureaucratic pressures and how these processes affect organizational change.

Blau&#x27;s second major contribution to organizational analysis revolved around the study of determinants of the &quot;bureaucratic components&quot; of organizations. He collected data on 53 Employment Security Agencies in the US and 1,201 local offices. The result of this research was Blau&#x27;s (1970) general theory of differentiation in organizations. This piece had an immediate impact in the field of organizations and more importantly American sociology.

Blau derived several generalizations, the most important which are (1) increasing size results in an increase in the number of distinct positions (differentiation) in an organization at a decreasing rate, and (2) as size increases the administrative component (personnel not directly engaged in production but in coordination) decreases. This specific work, however, had a brief influence as organization sociology moved away from monothetic generalizations about determinants of intra-organizational structure and to the study of organizational environments.

===Macrostructural theory of social structure===
Probably one of the biggest contributions Blau gave to sociology was his work in macrostructural theory. For him, social structure consisted of the networks of social relations that organize patterns of interaction across different social positions. During this time, many people had different definitions for social structure. Blau&#x27;s definition, however, set him apart from the rest. For Blau, social structure did not consist of natural persons, but instead social positions. This meant that the &quot;parts&quot; of social structure were classes of people such as men, women, rich and poor. Blau believed that the root of social structure can be found whenever an undifferentiated group begins to separate itself along some socially relevant distinction. In Blau&#x27;s eyes, one could not speak of social structure without speaking of the differentiation of people. He believes that it is these social distinctions along with some social characteristics (race, religion, age, gender, etc.) which determines who interacts with whom. His theory gave a more structured idea of &quot;homophily&quot; which describes the observation that people are drawn to others like themselves. This is because of structure although individuals may seem to have other interests but those are structurally produced as well. Blau coined the term &quot;parameter of social structure&quot; to refer to socially relevant positions that people could be classified as. Something could not be considered a parameter if it did not actually affect the social relations of individuals &quot;on the ground&quot;.

In his 1974 Presidential Address, &quot;Parameters of Social Structure&quot;, Blau discussed two categories of parameters: graduated and nominal. For Blau, modern society was characterized by the fact that they were composed of (1) multiplicity of socially relevant positions and (2) that these positions were connected and sometimes in contradictory ways resulting in cross-cutting social circles. Two positions are contradictory if one interaction increase leads to interaction of another decreasing.

==Quotation==
One of his most famous quotations is: &quot;One cannot marry an eskimo, if no eskimo is around&quot;.

The stated &quot;goal&quot; of Peter Blau&#x27;s work was: &quot;An understanding of social structure on the basis of an analysis of the social processes that govern the relations between individuals and groups. The basic question ... is how social life becomes organized into increasingly complex structures of associations among men.&quot;

==Legacy==
Peter Blau played an important role in shaping the field of modern sociology and is one of the most influential post-war American sociologists. He is sometimes considered the last great &quot;grand theorist&quot; of twentieth century American sociology. While Blau&#x27;s work in the differentiation of organizations was short-lived, his style of research was not. He provided an exemplar of how to do research and how to build theory. He proved that general and valuable deductive theory was possible in sociology. Blau eventually paved the way for many young sociologists that then used similar styles of research and deductive theory. In addition to that, he, along with the help of Otis Dudley Duncan, introduced multiple regression and path analysis to the sociological audience. These two methods are currently the go-to methods of quantitative sociology. Blau&#x27;s foundational theories continue to give momentum for development in social science and his ideas are still widely used.

<doc id="817530" wikidata="Q805425" url="?curid=817530" title="California State Route 237">
<text>State Route 237 (SR 237) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs from El Camino Real (SR 82) in Mountain View to Interstate 680 in Milpitas. Known as the Southbay Freeway for most of its length, SR 237 runs south of the San Francisco Bay, connecting the East Bay to the Peninsula.

==Route description==

Route 237 begins at a junction of Grant Road with El Camino Real (SR 82) in Mountain View, as a four lane divided highway. Most traffic comes from California State Route 85. Westbound traffic can connect to Route 85 southbound, but the eastbound traffic connection to Route 85 northbound is labeled as an exit for U.S. 101. Route 237 intersects with Highway 101 at the southern corner of Moffett Field. After this intersection, a carpool lane is added, for a total of three lanes in either direction. It remains like this until the east end of the freeway at Interstate 880, where most eastbound traffic is directed to northbound I-880. The route then becomes a city street (an arterial road), Calaveras Boulevard, in Milpitas, terminating at Interstate 680.

Starting from half a mile after the highway&#x27;s western terminus, and ending at the I-880 intersection, Route 237 is named the Southbay Freeway. It is mostly constructed to Interstate standards, although there are no current plans to make it an Interstate highway.

Route 237 is known for a number of companies that define Silicon Valley&#x27;s technological landscape. Many major software and hardware manufacturers have their headquarters along 237. Some of these manufacturers include Lockheed-Martin, Brocade Communications Systems, Nortel Networks, Cisco Systems, Yahoo!, Juniper Networks, TiVo, Ariba and NetApp.

SR 237 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

===Highway 237 Bikeway===
The Highway 237 Bikeway is a pedestrian and bicycle path that parallels State Route 237. The majority of the path is separated from vehicular traffic, however, two sections comprising a total of follow an on-street alignment adjacent the freeway.

This bikeway serves as an important connector in the network of trails in San Jose and Santa Clara County. It intersects with the Guadalupe River Trail, which provides access to Downtown San Jose. It also connects to the Bay Trail, the San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail, and the Coyote Creek Trail.

===Express lanes===
The SR 237 Express Lanes, the high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along Route 237 in both directions between Mathilda Avenue in Sunnyvale and I-880 in Milpitas, opened on March 20, 2012, east of North First Street and on November 22, 2019, up to Mathilda Avenue. Instead of terminating exactly at the I-880 interchange, the Express Lanes continue along an connector ramp to I-880, so that eastbound Express Lane users merge directly into the I-880 northbound HOV lane (which itself becomes an Express Lane), and I-880 southbound Express Lane users can directly enter Route 237&#x27;s westbound Express Lane.

, the HOT lanes&#x27; hours of operation is weekdays between 5:00 am and 8:00 pm; they are otherwise free and open to all vehicles at other times. Two-person carpools and clean air vehicles with a solo driver are charged 50 percent of the posted toll. Carpools with 3 or more people and motorcycles are not charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak &quot;Flex&quot; transponder with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants (1, 2, or 3+). Those with clean air vehicles need to apply for a special FasTrak &quot;CAV&quot; tag. Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.

==History==
Before Route 237 was upgraded to freeway status in 1994–1995, it was a four-lane expressway with at-grade intersections, known as Alviso-Milpitas Road or Milpitas-Alviso Road depending on different maps showing the description.

The Route 237 corridor has long been sought as a location for a freeway connector between Interstates 680 and 880. Many possible sites have been suggested, from Montague Expressway in North San Jose to Mission Boulevard in Fremont. One map printed before Route 237&#x27;s construction to freeway standards between Alviso and 880 showed a new freeway across bay wetlands between Alviso and the Scott Creek Road interchange in South Fremont. Grading and underpasses for a freeway interchange are presently visible along 680 near Scott Creek Road.

<doc id="817532" wikidata="Q4747947" url="?curid=817532" title="Amos Rusie">
<text>Amos Wilson Rusie (May 30, 1871 – December 6, 1942), nicknamed &quot;the Hoosier Thunderbolt&quot;, was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball during the late 19th century. He had a 10-season career in the National League (NL), which consisted of one season with the Indianapolis Hoosiers in , eight with the New York Giants from to , and one with the Cincinnati Reds in .

He is best known for the speed in which he pitched a baseball. The velocity of his fastball was unknown, but it has been estimated that he threw it in the mid-to-upper 90s. He led the league in strikeouts five times, and won 20 or more games eight times. Though he did throw hard, he did not have good control of his pitches, leading the league in walks five times and being seventh all-time among the career pitching leaders in that category. In 1890 he walked 289, the all-time single-season record.

In 1897, one of his fastballs struck future Hall of Fame shortstop Hughie Jennings in the head, rendering him comatose for four days before recovery. Rusie&#x27;s wildness had been a catalyst for officials to change the distance from the pitching rubber (the back line of the pitching box at the time) to home plate from to the current . This ruling was made effective for the season, at the peak of Amos Rusie&#x27;s pitching prowess. The distance change did not reduce Rusie&#x27;s effectiveness, as he led the league in strikeouts for three straight seasons afterward, while also winning what later would be known as the pitching triple crown in . For his accomplishments, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977 by the Veterans Committee.

==Early life==
Rusie was born on May 30, 1871, in Mooresville, Indiana, to mason and plasterer William Asbury Rusie and his wife Mary Donovan. When he was still young, his family moved to nearby Indianapolis, Indiana, where he eventually quit school to work in a factory. It was during this time, when he was playing for a semi-professional Indianapolis baseball team named the &quot;Sturm Avenue Never Sweats&quot;, that scouts first took notice of the speed with which he threw a baseball, and his effectiveness as a pitcher when he shutout touring National League baseball teams, the Boston Beaneaters and the Washington Senators.

In , at the age of 18, Rusie signed with the Burlington Babies of the Central Interstate League. However, he was signed shortly thereafter by the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the NL, and made his major league debut on May 9 in a 13-2 loss to the Cleveland Blues, pitching in relief of starting pitcher Jim Whitney. In 33 games pitched during the 1889 season, he posted a 12–10 win–loss record, he started 22, completed 19, and recorded one shutout. Although his fastball was difficult to hit, he did not have good control of it, walking 116 batters in 225 innings pitched, although he struck out 109 and led the league with 11 games finished (as a relief pitcher).

==New York Giants==

===1890–1892===
The Hoosiers disbanded at the conclusion of the 1889 season, and on March 22, 1890, he, along with many of his teammates, were transferred to the New York Giants by the league to strengthen the NL&#x27;s largest market. Coming into the 1890 season, Rusie filled the starting position that was vacated by future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe, who had joined the New York Giants of the newly formed Players&#x27; League (PL). Instead of evenly splitting pitching duties with Mickey Welch, another future Hall of Fame player, as Keefe had done the preceding five seasons, he started 62 games to Welch&#x27;s 37.
Rusie quickly became a sensation among fans, media, and society owing to the combination of his pitching velocity and physical size at , , which was considered large for the era. The fans began calling him the &quot;Hoosier Thunderbolt&quot;, while famed vaudeville act Weber and Fields used his name, a paperback book, &quot;Secrets of Amos Rusie, The World&#x27;s Greatest Pitcher, How He Obtained His Incredible Speed on Balls&quot;, was available for a quarter, a drink was named after him, and he received a message from the popular performer Lillian Russell.

On May 9, the Giants defeated the Boston Beaneaters by a score of 16–3, doing so by committing no errors, very rare for the era, and with Rusie allowing just 6 hits. Three days later, on May 12, Rusie was on the winning side of a pitching duel with future Hall of Famer Kid Nichols, in a game that ended with a home run by the Giants&#x27; Mike Tiernan in the 13th inning. The home run was described as a &quot;tape measure&quot; hit, sailing over the outfield fence and landing in an adjacent baseball field, Brotherhood Park, where a PL game was being played at the same time, causing fans of both parks to cheer.

Rusie completed the season with 67 games pitched, 62 games started, 56 complete games, four shutouts, 548.2 innings pitched, 2.56 earned run average (ERA), and a league-leading total of 341 strikeouts, the highest seasonal total he would have in his career. Due to the lack of control of his pitches, however, he also led the league with 289 walks, the all-time record for a season, and tossed 36 wild pitches, another total that topped the league. The Giants finished in sixth place among the eight NL teams, while Rusie won 29 games and had a league-leading 34 losses. As a hitter, he had a successful season with .278 batting average in 284 at bats, 13 doubles, six triples, and he scored 31 runs. Rusie married May Smith in Muncie, Indiana on November 8, 1890, in the Delaware County Clerk&#x27;s Office.

After the demise of the PL following the 1890 season, the Giants absorbed many of the players who had been on the crosstown rival&#x27;s roster. Future Hall of Famers Roger Connor, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, Buck Ewing, and Tim Keefe simply returned to the team, as well as George Gore, while John Ewing, and Danny Richardson were new signings, solidifying both a powerful hitting line-up and a solid pitching rotation for the 1891 season. While the upgraded Giants improved their final standings by finishing in third place among eight teams in the NL, and had a four-game lead over the Chicago Colts on June 16 when Rusie held them scoreless, and were 2.5 games behind the Colts on September 19, they were 13 games back at the close of the season.

After having been on the losing end of no-hitter by Tom Lovett of the Brooklyn Bridegrooms on June 22, Rusie returned the favor by throwing one of his own against them just over a month later on July 31. After winning both games of a doubleheader against the Bridegrooms in September, Rusie and several other star players were rested for the remainder of the season, a five-game series against the Boston Beaneaters. Rusie&#x27;s 337 strikeouts and 262 bases on balls led the league for the second consecutive year, and his six shutouts marked the first time he led the league in that category. His record improved to 33–20, and he followed that up in 1892 with a record of 32–31, 304 strikeouts (second-best to Bill Hutchison) and 270 walks.

===1893–1898===

After the 1892 season, in a move that was orchestrated by Giants&#x27; owner Andrew Freedman, Amos Rusie was released in a move to get him to sign a new contract for lesser value. It was a typical move for a man who was considered to be both malevolent and stingy to his players. Despite a gentleman&#x27;s agreement between the owners not to sign him, the Chicago White Stockings picked him for $8,250, which included a $2,000 bonus. The chagrined Giants bought the contract back and even had the temerity to try to count the bonus money as part of his salary. With the pitching area being moved back in 1893, Rusie&#x27;s strikeout total dropped to 208; still he was the league leader. The 1893 campaign was a truly extraordinary one for Amos Rusie, with 50 complete games in 52 starts and went 33–21.
In 1894, Rusie won pitching&#x27;s triple crown. He led the league in wins with 36–13, strikeouts with 195, and with a league best ERA of 2.78 (especially spectacular considering that the league average that year was 5.32). He also led the league in walks for the fifth straight time with an even 200. His pitching was keystone in leading the normally also-ran Giants to National League runner up that year.

After the conclusion of the 1894 regular season, a Pittsburgh sportsman named William C. Temple sponsored a trophy for the winner between the regular season 1st and 2nd place teams in the National League. The runner-up Giants swept the Baltimore Orioles, who featured Hall of Famers John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson, 4–0. Rusie was virtually untouchable in the Temple Cup, giving up only one earned run while winning two complete games and compiling a 0.50 ERA; if that was not enough, he even batted .429. Rusie&#x27;s win total that year was fourth best since the establishment of the modern pitching distance of 60&#x27;-6&quot;.

Rusie won his last strikeout crown in the 1895 campaign with 201. However, he finished with a mediocre (by his standards) 23 wins and 23 losses. After a bitter contract dispute with Giants&#x27; owner Andrew Freedman, where the owner looked at his 23 losses and alleged he was slacking off in his training, Rusie responded by publicly thumbing his nose at Freedman — the 19th century variant of the middle finger. He was fined $200 (he made only $2,500 a year). Rusie refused to play until Freedman returned his money and ended up holding out for the entire 1896 season. It was a fiasco for baseball; fans boycotted and the press railed against the owners. Owners implored Rusie and Freedman to compromise; neither would budge. The holdout was finally settled just before the 1897 season, as the owners collaborated for recoupment of the garnished wages, as well as a $5,000 settlement ($ in today&#x27;s dollars). This was partially out of respect for Rusie. However, the primary motivator was the threat of legal action against the reserve clause had his case gone to court.

==Later life==
Following the 1898 season, arm trouble, hearing damage from a line drive to the head, and other problems kept Rusie out of baseball for two years. In December 1900, after he had not pitched for them in two years, Rusie was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Christy Mathewson. The trade is one of the most lopsided in baseball history; Rusie pitched poorly in three games before retiring, while Mathewson won 371 games for the Giants and was part of the inaugural class inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936.

Rusie finished his career with 245 wins, 174 losses, 1,934 strikeouts and a 3.07 ERA. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977.

Rusie died in Seattle, Washington, in 1942.

<doc id="817538" wikidata="Q1148202" url="?curid=817538" title="OQO">
<text>OQO was a U.S. computer hardware company that was notable for manufacture of handheld computers. Its systems possessed the functionality of a tablet PC in a size slightly larger than a personal digital assistant (PDA). According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, the &quot;OQO&quot; was the smallest full-powered, full-featured personal computer in 2005. The company&#x27;s first version of subnotebook computer was the OQO model 01. It had been compared with the Ultra Mobile PC platform, although it was introduced before the UMPC took flight. The company was founded in 2000.

OQO was reported to have stopped production in April 2009. The company confirmed that it had ceased operations in May 2009 because of financial difficulties.

==OQO Model 01==

The original OQO model 01 was announced several years before prototypes were even seen, leading many people to call it vaporware until it was finally released in Q3 of 2004. The computer shipped with Windows XP installed (Home Edition or Professional, but the Tablet PC Edition was not available until the model 01+ was released) and featured a 1 GHz Transmeta Crusoe processor, 20 GB hard drive, and 256 MB of RAM. It included USB 1.1, FireWire 400, a headphone port, and a built-in microphone, integrated 802.11b wireless radio, as well as Bluetooth. The OQO used a Wacom electromagnetic induction-type pen stylus with a magnetic field sensitive 800x480 resolution transflective screen. Retail shipments began on October 14, 2004.
Its size was and it weighed .

== OQO Model 01+ ==
The OQO model 01+ was announced and released on September 27, 2005. Representing an incremental update to the model 01, the model 01+ featured a larger 30 GB hard drive, 512 MB of RAM, USB 2.0, and an internal speaker. It also added support for portrait display mode. It also had a redesigned screen bezel intended to improve the accuracy of its Wacom-enabled display by increasing the space between the bezel and edge of the display.

Originally it was only available running Windows XP Home or Pro editions. A version with Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 was introduced on January 4, 2006, taking advantage of handwriting recognition and improved navigation.

== OQO Model 02 ==
The OQO model 02 was introduced by Bill Gates in January 2007 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It weighed and was small enough to fit in a pocket; at the time it was the world&#x27;s smallest fully-functional Windows Vista PC.

Like its predecessor, the model 02 was a handheld device that ran Windows (XP Professional or Vista Business.) It featured a new black casing and a backlit keyboard, a brighter 5 inch LCD screen, and 800 × 480 pixel display with an active digitizer for pen-based input.

Several models were introduced at the time with VIA C7-M ULV processors (1.2 GHz, 1.5 GHz, or 1.6 GHz) and choice of 512 MB or 1 GB of RAM. 32 or 64 GB solid-state drives (SSDs) or standard hard drives from 60 to 120 GB were available. Also included were Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11a/b/g WiFi, USB 2.0, a 3.5 mm x 1 line-out/line-in audio jack and an HDMI-out port. The model 02 also offered optional integrated EV-DO mobile broadband with choice of Verizon or Sprint as service provider.

Advanced security features were also provided, including an on-board Trusted Platform Module, and thanks to the VIA C7-M&#x27;s built-in Padlock features, hardware-level encryption, hashing and random number generation functions.

The model 02 also had the ability to zoom to 800 ×  and 800 ×  interpolated modes, horizontal/vertical screen rotation, and a sensor that automatically protected the hard drive in case of a drop. Accessories included a docking station (with a DVD+-RW drive, HDMI and VGA video out, three USB 2.0 ports, and a 3.5 mm audio jack), an extended battery lasting up to six hours, and choice of a soft leatherette &quot;executive&quot; case or durable aluminum &quot;stronghold&quot; case.

The model 02 won the following awards:
* Stevie Award for Best New Product
* Japan’s 2007 Good Design Award
* &quot;LAPTOP Magazine&quot;, Ultimate Mobility Issue: LAPTOP Ultimate Choice 2007
* &quot;Business 2.0 Magazine&quot;: 4 Stars (Editor’s Choice) and &quot;Our Picks for ... Ultramobile PCs.&quot;

== OQO Model e2 ==

OQO in September 2007 announced the availability of the model e2 with embedded HSDPA mobile broadband capability, providing customers in Europe and Asia with widely available high-speed Internet connectivity.

The OQO model e2 with embedded HSDPA was designed specifically to meet international demand for anytime/anywhere computing with Internet access and networked PC applications in a pocketable and ergonomic design. It supported &quot;open SIM&quot; HSDPA (3.5G) as well as UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.

It supported data access through UMTS/HSDPA at 2100 MHz, and was downward compatible with GPRS/EDGE networks at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz. Download speeds of up to 3.6 Mbit/s were supported.

The product was available SIM-free and network unlocked, allowing customers flexibility in selecting their preferred wireless operator and data plan. Users had a choice of tri-band wide-area wireless, WiFi 802.11a/b/g and Bluetooth 2.0.

The model 02 and model e2 came with a VIA C7-M ULV processor (1.6 GHz, 1.5 GHz, or 1.2 GHz), up to 1 GB of RAM, up to a 120 GB hard drive, with the option of a 32 GB or 64 GB solid-state drive, Bluetooth 2.0 (with enhanced data rate), tri-mode WiFi (802.11a/b/g) and optional 3G mobile broadband (EV-DO in the US, UMTS/HSDPA internationally).

== OQO Model 2+ ==
The Atom-based &quot;model 2+&quot; was unveiled at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco labeled as &quot;OQO MID&quot; as a &quot;technology demonstration.&quot; The model 2+ was formally announced at CES 2009, and was available with a 1.33 GHz or 1.86 GHz Intel Atom processor, 2 GB RAM, Qualcomm Gobi global wireless internet, touchscreen, and was the first PC to feature an active matrix OLED display.

The projected shipping date was around May 22, 2009, but the product never shipped. OQO ceased production because of financial difficulties.

== Bankruptcy ==
The company confirmed that it had ceased operations in May 2009 because of financial difficulties. In April 2009, OQO started returning unrepaired in-warranty devices. In addition, the company stated that it would no longer offer any repair or service support, although third-party warranties remained in effect.

<text>Ancient Shores is a science fiction novel by American writer Jack McDevitt, published in 1996. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1997.
A continuation of this novel by the same writer was published in 2015, entitled Thunderbird. 
==Plot summary==

A vast lake, known as Lake Agassiz, covered much of North Dakota, Manitoba and Minnesota during prehistoric times.

The story begins when farmer Tom Lasker and his son, Will, uncover a seemingly brand new yacht. Found on a landlocked farm, it draws tourists to the area. Max Collingswood, a friend of Tom&#x27;s, tries to help discover the origins of the boat. Collingswood enlists April Cannon, a worker at a chemical lab who discovers that the yacht is made of an unknown material. In fact, it is a fiberglass-like material with an impossible atomic number (161).

Collingswood and Cannon discover something else on a nearby ridge which is part of a Sioux reservation. The Sioux assist in its excavation and examination. It turns out to be a green glassy roundhouse-like structure, made from the same material.

Eventually, they gain access to it, revealing a dock for the sailboat, but no entrance for it. The discovery that the structure contains the means to access other sites not on Earth sets off a struggle between the Government and the Reservation for control of it.

<doc id="817552" wikidata="Q2058139" url="?curid=817552" title="Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna">
<text>Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna (17 December 1574 – 24 September 1624) was a Spanish nobleman and politician. He was the 2nd Marquis of Peñafiel, 7th Count of Ureña, Spanish Viceroy of Sicily (1611–1616), Viceroy of Naples (1616–1620), a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece since 1608, Grandee of Spain, member of the Spanish Supreme Council of War, and the subject of several poems by his friend, counselor and assistant, Francisco de Quevedo.

He served as a footsoldier and climbed the ranks, an unusual career for an aristocrat, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. As Viceroy of Sicily and Naples, Osuna reorganized the local administration and armadas with new strategies and ships, and implemented a highly profitable and successful privateering system against the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Venice and the Barbary pirates. Despite opposition in the court, he maintained Mediterranean dominance during the ten years of his mandates, achieving victories like Cape Corvo, Cape Celidonia and Ragusa. At his peak, his individual naval power is believed to have rivaled that of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.

Osuna was eventually deposed in 1620, undoing much of his work, in midst of the political unstability caused by the fall of the royal minister Francisco de Sandoval, Duke of Lerma. Venetians claimed Osuna had participated in a conspiracy to take over Venice, while the Neapolitan aristocracy purported he intended to secede from Spain and become King of Naples. He denied all accusations and died in prison while awaiting for judgement.

==Early life==
He was born in Osuna, province of Sevilla, and baptized on 18 January 1575, the son of Juan Téllez-Girón, 2nd Duke of Osuna, and of his wife Ana María de Velasco, daughter of Íñigo Fernández de Velasco, 4th Duke of Frías and Constable of Castile.

According to the first biography published in 1699 by the Protestant Milanese Gregorio Leti, which has been until the 20th century the main and most exploited source of information on the third Duke of Osuna, when a boy he accompanied his grandfather, the 1st duke, Viceroy of Naples (1582–1586). But this, as many other pieces of information, anecdotes, speeches and stories of Leti&#x27;s biography are doubtful nowadays; the same happens with his alleged participation, in the royal expedition to Zaragoza to put down the Aragonese revolt in 1588 as by then he was only aged 13.

Pedro Téllez-Girón married Catalina Enríquez de Ribera y Cortés on 17 January 1594. In April 1594 he inherited the dukedom Afán de Ribera.

Although deeply indebted, the estate of Osuna came under the Council of Castile administration because of his young age, to avoid money mismanagements. The estate of Osuna was only second by total wealth in Spain to that of the Duke of Medina Sidonia.

In 1602, apparently with the agreement of Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías, Constable of Castile, his uncle and political godfather and one of the most powerful and outstanding personalities of the reign of King Philip III of Spain, Osuna escaped from his confinement in the castle of Cuéllar, a place/prison used for the last two centuries to control &quot;illustrious&quot; Crown guests accompanied by a servant, arriving in Brussels in October of that year.

==Military career==
Initially, he enlisted in the army of the Archduke Albert of Austria as a private, but soon he was given the command of two cavalry companies. In 1602 and 1603 he had a role in controlling and defusing the mutinies which erupted in Brabant among the armies of the Archduke, even financing the arrangements with the mutineers with his own money, raised in Flanders with the guarantee of his Spanish properties. Besides, he took part in several important battles, being seriously wounded twice.

Another of Leti&#x27;s legends says that in 1604 he went to London, as a member of the embassy sent by king Philip III of Spain to king James I Stuart to sign the Treaty of Peace, the ambassador being the Constable of Castile, the later assessment being indeed true.

In 1608, when the negotiations for the 12 years truce between Maurice of Nassau and Ambrogio Spinola within the Eighty Years War had already begun in The Hague, he took no part as he was against them. He returned to Spain as a hero, being decorated in 1608 with the Order of the Golden Fleece, the highest decoration given by the King of Spain as head of the Habsburg dynasty.

In 1608 he arranged the marriage of his son, Juan, with the daughter of Cristóbal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda, the son and assistant of Francisco Gómez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma, the Prime Minister and Valido of king Philip III of Spain. The political meaning of such an agreement was indeed that he was accepted as a member of the Lerma&#x27;s family and group of friends, the real ruling elite of the Spanish monarchy at the time, till he was displaced around 1621 by his political enemy, Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares.

==In Italy==

===As viceroy of Sicily===
On 18 September 1610 he was named viceroy of Sicily, and took possession of his post at Milazzo on 9 March 1611. During his Sicilian viceroyalty he organized a squadron of galleys for the Royal Navy but also his own corsair fleet.

He launched several successful expeditions against Berber pirates and harbours, as well as against the Turks. In 1613 Ottavio d&#x27;Aragona was victorious in the Battle of Cape Corvo. In 1616, the commander of the royal Sicilian fleet, Francisco de Rivera y Medina, achieved another important victory against Turkish galleys in the Battle of Cape Celidonia. Aragona later performed a raid on Constantinople, the capital city of the Ottoman Empire. Overall, Osuna set up a sizable naval force in Sicily and reinforced the military might of the island.

===As viceroy of Naples===
In 1616 he was promoted to viceroy of Naples, and held the office until June 1620. The main problem for Spain in Italy was French and Savoyard ambitions on the Duchy of Milan, a key territory from the strategic point of view to maintain military communications between Spain and the Low Countries and other Habsburg territories in Europe.

Between 1613 and 1618 Spain and Savoy were at war (War of the Montferrat Succession), the former trying to contain the Duke of Savoy within the boundaries established after the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559). Osuna clashed against the Neapolitan nobility due to the extraction of taxes to supply the necessary armies. Given that the main provider of financial help to Savoy was the Republic of Venice, Osuna proposed that destroying the Venetian dominion of the Adriatic gulf and even conquering Venice itself was convenient and feasible.

In May 1618 the Venetian authorities claimed to have uncovered a very serious conspiracy to sack the city and burn the arsenal, summarily executing a number of alleged participants (all of them French) but insinuating that the real and secret heads of the plot were Osuna and the Spanish ambassador to Venice, the Marquis of Bedmar. The so-called &quot;Conspiracy of the Spaniards against Venice of 1618&quot; has been a question open to discussion among historians for the last four centuries. Spanish and German historians have a tendency to deny that the conspiracy was real or was serious enough; French and Italian historians have the opposite view.

The end of Osuna&#x27;s government in Naples was very confused and tense. On the one hand, the nobility of Naples was increasingly hostile to Osuna, one of the main reasons being the economic burden imposed by the need to feed and lodge the big military force (12,000 soldiers) that Osuna had lodged in the city without the agreement of its representative bodies. On the other, because of Osuna&#x27;s support to the political demands of the representatives of the low classes, &quot;the people&quot;. In June 1620 the new temporary Viceroy, Cardinal Borja, former ambassador to Rome, took possession of the Viceroyalty against all formal rules, but Osuna accepted the authority of Borja and returned obediently to Madrid.

==Fall and death==
A few days after Philip III&#x27;s death, in 1621, in a &#x27;purge&#x27; by the ministers of the new and very young king against Lerma&#x27;s family and friends, Osuna was arrested by a decision of the State Council – the highest political and administrative body of the Spanish Monarchy – on a large and wide-ranging array of accusations (corruption, but also impiety, sexual misconduct, etc.). He remained under house arrest (imprisoned in castles or noble houses) until his death in September 1624. The purge was actively promoted by the new Royal prime minister, Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares.

No sentence was ever pronounced, but the House of Osuna was out of the royal favour for three decades, and only during the reign of Charles II did it again play an important role in Spanish political life.

<doc id="817561" wikidata="Q3487791" url="?curid=817561" title="Choronzon">
<text>Choronzon is a demon that originated in writing with the 16th-century occultists Edward Kelley and John Dee within the latter&#x27;s occult system of Enochian magic. In the 20th century he became an important element within the mystical system of Thelema, founded by Aleister Crowley, where he is the &quot;dweller in the abyss&quot;, believed to be the last great obstacle between the adept and enlightenment. Thelemites believe that if he is met with proper preparation, then his function is to destroy the ego (causing ego death), which allows the adept to move beyond the abyss of occult cosmology.

==Spelling variations==
Including Crowley&#x27;s spelling of the name, &quot;Choronzon&quot;, there appear to be three alternatives. Meric Casaubon states that the name is &quot;Coronzon&quot; (without an &#x27;h&#x27;) in his &quot;True and Faithful Relation&quot;. However, this is at variance with the spelling that appears in John Dee&#x27;s own journals. Laycock&#x27;s &quot;Enochian Dictionary&quot; gives the latter spelling as &quot;Coronzom&quot;, citing an original manuscript (Cotton XLVI Pt. I, fol. 91a) as the source for the variant.

==View of Aleister Crowley==

Otherwise known as &quot;the demon of dispersion&quot;, Choronzon is described by Crowley as a temporary personification of the raving and inconsistent forces that occupy the abyss. In this system, Choronzon is given form in evocation only so it may be mastered.

Crowley states that he and Victor Benjamin Neuburg evoked Choronzon in Bou Saâda, Algeria in December 1909. In Crowley&#x27;s account, it is unclear whether Choronzon was evoked into an empty Solomonic triangle while Crowley sat elsewhere, or whether Crowley himself was the medium into which the demon was invoked. Nearly all writers except Lawrence Sutin take him to mean the latter. In the account, Choronzon is described as changing shape, which is read variably as an account of an actual metamorphosis, a subjective impression of Neuburg&#x27;s, or fabrication on Crowley&#x27;s part.

The account describes the demon throwing sand over the triangle to breach it, following which it attacked Neuburg &#x27;in the form of a naked savage&#x27;, forcing him to drive it back at the point of a dagger. Crowley&#x27;s account has been criticized as unreliable, as the relevant original pages are torn from the notebook in which the account was written. This, along with other inconsistencies in the manuscript, has led to speculation that Crowley embroidered the event to support his own belief system. Crowley wrote, in a footnote to the account in Liber 418, that &quot;(t)he greatest precautions were taken at the time, and have since been yet further fortified, to keep silence concerning the rite of evocation.&quot;

Arthur Calder-Marshall states in &quot;The Magic of my Youth&quot; that Neuburg gave a quite different account of the event, recounting that he and Crowley evoked the spirit of &quot;a foreman builder from Ur of the Chaldees&quot;, who chose to call himself &quot;P.472&quot;. The conversation begins when two British students ask Neuburg about a version of the story in which Crowley turned him into a zebra and sold him to a zoo. both the words attributed to him in Liber 418 and the statement of Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin.

Choronzon is deemed to be held in check by the power of the goddess Babalon, inhabitant of Binah, the third sephirah of the Tree of Life. Both Choronzon and the abyss are discussed in Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;:

C. F. Russell, one of Crowley&#x27;s disciples, went on to found the Choronzon Club, later renamed the GBG.

==In popular culture==
An invocation of Choronzon forms the basis for a 1980 episode of &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot; entitled &quot;Guardian of the Abyss&quot;, in which a cult called The Choronzon Society uses John Dee&#x27;s scrying mirror to conjure Choronzon.

<doc id="817569" wikidata="Q2828736" url="?curid=817569" title="Airman's Medal">
<text>The Airman&#x27;s Medal (AmnM) is a military award and decoration of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force for personnel who distinguish themselves by heroism involving voluntary risk of their life not involving actual combat with an armed enemy of the United States. The medal was established on 6 July 1960 by 10 U.S. Code 8750 and is awarded to those service members or those of a friendly nation while serving in any capacity with the U.S. Air Force or U.S. Space Force. The performance must have involved personal hazard or danger.

The Airman&#x27;s Medal was authorized on 10 August 1956 to replace the U.S. Army&#x27;s Soldier&#x27;s Medal which had also been awarded to qualifying Air Force personnel since 26 September 1947. According to Air Force Instruction 36–2803, The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Personnel Council approves or disapproves recommendations for Airman&#x27;s Medals requiring Secretary of the Air Force final approval and determines upon approval, entitlement to 10 percent increase in retirement pay for the Airman&#x27;s Medal when awarded to enlisted members for extraordinary heroism.

The Airman&#x27;s Medal is equivalent to the Army&#x27;s Soldier&#x27;s Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and the Coast Guard Medal. Additional awards of the Airman&#x27;s Medal are denoted by oak leaf clusters.

The first recipient of the Airman&#x27;s Medal was Captain John Burger, U.S. Air Force, who was awarded the medal at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, on 21 July 1960, for heroism performed on 9 September 1959.
==Design==
The medal was designed and sculpted by Thomas Hudson Jones of the Army Institute of Heraldry. On the obverse of the circular medal is the figure of the Greek god Hermes, son of Zeus, resting on one knee. He has just released from his open hands an American Bald Eagle, shown rising into flight. Within the raised rim of the medal, is the inscription &quot;Airman&#x27;s Medal&quot; in raised letters. The reverse of the medal, has a raised outer edge and bears the inscription: “For Valor” above a space for the recipient&#x27;s name which is within a stylized laurel wreath open at the top and tied at the bottom.

The Airman&#x27;s Medal is unique in that its shape does not follow the octagonal shape of its counterparts, the Soldier&#x27;s Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Medal and the Coast Guard Medal. It had been established practice heretofore to design military decorations with a distinctive shape, so that they would not be confused at a distance with service or campaign medals, which are always circular in shape. The reason for this is because the design was originally approved for use as the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal.
==Notable recipients==

*Paul K. Carlton Jr., for his rescuing several people after American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon during the September 11 attacks
*Adam Kinzinger, for saving the life of a woman who was being attacked by her knife-wielding boyfriend.
*Michael Landsberry, for his actions during the 2013 Sparks Middle School shooting, including reasoning with the shooter and protecting several students.
*William H. Pitsenbarger for aiding and defending a unit of soldiers pinned down by an enemy assault during the Vietnam War. Before his death he helped save over 60 men in the battle.
*Spencer Stone, for disarming a terrorist during the 2015 Thalys train attack.
*Colonel Paul Sowada and Cadet 2nd Class Phillip Michael Sowada, who rescued three people from drowning off the beach at Vandenberg Air Force Base on Christmas Day, 1997. The three swimmers were caught in a dangerous rip tide and were being swept out to sea. They are also the only father/son duo to be awarded the medal for the same act of valor.
*Matthew La Porte , Cadet La Porte distinguished himself by heroism involving voluntary risk of life in Norris Hall on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University on 16 April 2007. On that day gunfire erupted in the hallway outside of Room 211 and the professor told her students to get down and to move to the back of the classroom to take cover behind desks, Cadet La Porte instead moved to the front of the room and barricaded the door with a large, heavy desk in an attempt to defend the class. When the shooter subsequently forced his way into the classroom, Cadet La Porte, with complete disregard for his own safety, unhesitatingly charged the shooter in an aggressive attempt to stop him, drawing heavy fire at close range, and sustaining seven gunshot wounds. Cadet La Porte&#x27;s actions helped save lives by slowing down the shooter and by taking fire that would have been directed at his classmates.

<doc id="817582" wikidata="Q1722866" url="?curid=817582" title="Kamashastra">
<text>In Indian literature, Kāma-[[shastra]] refers to the tradition of works about kāma (broadly desire; particularly love, erotic, sensual and sexual desire in this case). Kāma-shastra aims to instruct the townsman (nāgarika) in the attainment of enjoyment and fulfillment.

== Etymology ==
Kāma () is a Sanskrit word that has the general meanings of &quot;wish&quot;, &quot;desire&quot;, and &quot;intention&quot; in addition to the specific meanings of &quot;pleasure&quot; and &quot;(sexual) love&quot;. Used as a proper name, it refers to Kamadeva, the Hindu god of love.

== History ==
A sage Śvetaketu produced a work too vast to be accessible. A scholar called Babhravya, together with his group of disciples, produced a summary of Śvetaketu&#x27;s summary, which nonetheless remained a huge and encyclopaedic tome. Between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC, several authors reproduced different parts of Babhravya&#x27;s work in various specialist treatises. Among the authors, those whose names are known are Charayana, Ghotakamukha, Gonardiya, Gonikaputra, Suvarnanabha, and Dattaka.

However, the oldest available text on this subject is the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; ascribed to Vātsyāyana who is often erroneously called &quot;Mallanaga Vātsyāyana&quot;. Yashodhara, in his commentary on the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;, attributes the origin of erotic science to Mallanaga, the &quot;prophet of the Asuras&quot;, implying that the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; originated in prehistoric times. The attribution of the name &quot;Mallanaga&quot; to Vātsyāyana is due to the confusion of his role as editor of the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; with the role of the mythical creator of erotic science. Vātsyāyana&#x27;s birth date is not accurately known, but he must have lived earlier than the 7th century since he is referred to by Subandhu in his poem Vāsavadattā. Vātsyāyana was familiar with the Arthashastra of Kautilya. Vātsyāyana refers to and quotes a number of texts on this subject, most of which have been lost.

Following Vātsyāyana, a number of authors wrote on Kāmashastra, some writing independent manuals of erotics, while others commented on Vātsyāyana. Later well-known works include Kokkaka&#x27;s &quot;Ratirahasya&quot; (13th century) and &quot;Anangaranga&quot; of Kalyanamalla (16th century). The most well-known commentator on Vātsyāyana is Jayamangala (13th century).

<text>James Reynolds Gregory (29 December 1832 – 15 December 1899) was a noted 19th-century British mineralogist. He founded a mineral specimen business in 1858 which is today known as &quot;Gregory, Bottley &amp; Lloyd&quot;. Gregory&#x27;s company had a reputation as one of the best in the business providing mineral samples for scientists as well as private collectors. He primarily bought his specimens at auction or from other collectors and dealers, rarely collecting from the field.

When he was sent in 1868 by diamond merchant Harry Emmanuel of London&#x27;s Hatton Garden to Hopetown, South Africa, to determine if claims of diamonds being found there were true, he investigated and reported back, that &quot;The whole story of the Cape diamond discoveries is false, and is simply one of the many schemes for trying to promote the employment and expenditure of capital in searching for this substance in the colony&quot;.

He concluded by saying that any genuine diamonds had most likely been swallowed and excreted by wandering ostriches &quot;from a far-distant region&quot;.

However, shortly thereafter, experts pronounced a stone that he had dismissed to be a &quot;magnificent white diamond weighing 83½ carats&quot; (16.7 g). This stone was to be known as the Star of South Africa, also known as the Dudley diamond.

The affair proved extremely embarrassing for him. For a number of years thereafter any lie or mis-statement about a diamond was dismissed as a &quot;Gregory&quot;.

<text>John &quot;Porcell&quot; Porcelly (born February 3, 1967), also known as Paramananda Das, is an American musician, best known as the guitarist for the 1980s hardcore bands Young Republicans, Violent Children, Youth of Today, and Judge. He also sang in Project X (under the pseudonym Slam), and has had stints in other bands such as Bold and Gorilla Biscuits. More recently he has played in bands like Shelter, Never Surrender and Last of the Famous.

He also wrote and published the fanzine &quot;War on Illusion&quot; and ran the record label/fanzine Schism along with Alex Brown (Gorilla Biscuits/Side By Side/Project X). Porcelly currently runs the record label Fight Fire with Fire.

In 1991, Porcelly formed a band with Zack de la Rocha based at the Revelation Records headquarters in Huntington Beach, California, in which Rocha was the vocalist and Porcelly played guitar. Although the group never officially had a name, at one point in time, Rocha proposed the name &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot;, however Porcelly believed the name to be too long, leading to Rocha using it as the name for his other band at the time. The band&#x27;s music merged elements of hardcore punk and hip hop.

In 2006, Bold reunited with Porcelly on second guitar and began a European tour while also writing and recording a new album. He also sang a live set of 80s straight edge cover songs with the Florida band Gator Bait at Florida&#x27;s Significant Records Fest. The set included songs from his previous projects Youth of Today, Project X and Judge.

In 2008, Porcelly launched his straight-edge clothing company &quot;True Till Death&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Prior to his joining of Shelter, Porcelly took interest in the spiritual movement &#x27;International Society for Krishna Consciousness&#x27; and has maintained interest in it since; he is an active member of ISKCON. He is referred in ISKCON by his &#x27;spiritual&#x27; name &quot;Paramananda Das&quot;. He travels across the United States teaching and lecturing Vinyasa and Bhakti Yoga. He has been straight edge and a vegetarian for most of his life.

<text>Solanum viarum, the tropical soda apple, is a perennial shrub native to Brazil and Argentina with a prickly stem and prickly leaves. The fruit is golf-ball-sized with the coloration of a watermelon. It is considered an invasive species in the lower eastern coastal states of the United States and recently on the Mid North Coast of Australia.

==Synonyms==
This species has several synonyms, one of which is particularly ambiguous:
* &quot;Solanum chloranthum&quot; 
:&quot;S. chloranthum&quot; as described by Poeppig based on Otto Sendtner in von Martius is now &quot;S. velutinum&quot;
:&quot;S. chloranthum&quot; as described by Philipp Salzmann based on Dunal in de Candolle is now &quot;S. agrarium&quot;
:&quot;S. chloranthum&quot; as described by C.P.J. Sprengel is now &quot;S. arenarium&quot; as described by Otto Sendtner
* &quot;Solanum khasianum&quot; var. &quot;chatterjeeanum&quot; 
:&quot;S. khasianum&quot; proper is now &quot;S. aculeatissimum&quot; as described by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin.
* &quot;Solanum viridiflorum&quot; 
:Not to be confused with &quot;S. acuminatum&quot; var. &quot;viridiflorum&quot;, which is now &quot;S. caavurana&quot;.

==Introduction and control==
&quot;Solanum viarum&quot; is native to Brazil and Argentina, and was first discovered in the United States in 1988, having probably been introduced through contaminated seed or other agricultural products. It crowds out native species and forage for livestock
 Its habitat is terrestrial, in fields, rights-of-way, and open forest. It is spread by livestock and wildlife, such as raccoons, deer, feral hogs, and birds feeding on fruits.

It is classified as a noxious weed or plant in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas, and Vermont, and in California and Oregon it&#x27;s a quarantine pest. It is a prohibited noxious weed in Arizona and Minnesota; Prohibited in Massachusetts; and a plant pest in South Carolina and Tennessee. It is also listed as a tier 1 noxious weed in Virginia, along with giant hogweed.

Since its introduction into the U.S., tropical soda apple has spread rapidly, and currently infests an estimated one million acres of improved pastures, citrus groves, sugarcane fields, ditches, vegetable crops, sod farms, forestlands (oak hammocks and cypress heads), natural areas, etc. in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. Although it can be a threat to a variety of habitat, it tends to be most problematic in pastures in the Mid South.

It is controlled by triclopyr herbicide. &quot;Gratiana boliviana&quot;, the tropical soda apple leaf beetle, has been used successfully as an agent of biological pest control to reduce the abundance of this plant in the United States, particularly in Florida.

==Flowering==
The mature fruits are smooth, round, yellow and ¾ to 1¼ inches in diameter with a leathery-skin surrounding a thin-layered, pale green, scented pulp and 180 to 420 flattened, reddish brown seeds. Each plant is capable of producing 200 or more fruit per year. Tropical Soda Apple (Solanum viarum) usually grows to 3–6 ft tall.

<text>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) is a flexible protocol designed for allocating objects within registries over the Internet. The motivation for the creation of EPP was to create a robust and flexible protocol that could provide communication between domain name registries and domain name registrars. These transactions are required whenever a domain name is registered or renewed, thereby also preventing domain hijacking. Before its introduction, registries had no uniform approach, and many different proprietary interfaces existed. While its use for domain names was the initial driver, the protocol is designed to be usable for any kind of ordering and fulfillment system.

EPP is based on XML - a structured, text-based format. The underlying network transport is not fixed, although the only currently specified method is over TCP. The protocol has been designed with the flexibility to allow it to use other transports such as BEEP, SMTP, SOAP or HTTPS. However only HTTPS has seen some usage while the vast majority uses TCP.

== History ==
The first protocol drafts were published as IETF individual submission Internet Draft documents by Scott Hollenbeck of Verisign in November 2000. The individual submission documents were adopted by the IETF &quot;Provisioning Registry&quot; (&quot;provreg&quot;) working group, which was created after a BoF session was held at IETF-49 in December 2000. Proposed Standard documents (RFCs 3730 - 3734) were published by the RFC Editor in March 2004. Draft Standard documents (RFCs 4930 - 4934) were published in May 2007. 

In August 2009, IETF granted EPP the status of full standard as STD 69.

The first EPP extension that became a proposed standard was the redemption grace period extension from RFC 3915 in September 2004. Since then, several different proposed standard extensions followed.

==Adoption==
The protocol has been adopted by a number of ccTLD domain name registries, such as: .ac, .ag, .ai, .as, .ar, .at, .au, .be, .br, .bz, .ca, .cat, .cc, .ch, .cl, .cn, .co, .cr, .cx, .cz, .dk, .dm, .ee, .es (over HTTPS), .eu, .fi, .fm, .fr, .gg, .gr (over HTTPS), .gs, .hn, .ht, .il, .im, .in, .io, .it (over HTTPS), .je, .ke, .ki, .ky, .kz, .la, .lc, .li, .lt, .lu, .lv, .md, .me, .mk, .mn, .ms, .mu, .mx, .na, .nf, .ng, .nl, .no, .nu, .nz, .pe, .pk, .pl (over HTTPS), .ps, .pt, .ru, .ro, .sc, .se, .sh, .si, .su, .tl, .tm .tv, .tw, .ua, .uk, .us, .vc, .ve and .za as well as ENUM registries such as those operating the +31, +41, +43, +44 and +48 country codes.

ICANN has made it a condition in their base registry contract to offer an EPP service. Therefore, every gTLD has adopted the protocol.

There are multiple open source implementations of EPP server software. The Council of Country Code Administrators (CoCCA) maintains an EPP server software used by around 59 ccTLDs and six gTLDs. Another open source software is FRED (maintained by CZ.NIC) which counts 11 ccTLDs as its users.

== Protocol commands ==
There are three classes of commands: Session management, query, and object transform. These commands can then be mapped onto objects, which specifies their exact functionality. The most common standardized objects are hosts, contacts and domains. There are also other standardized objects like organizations, however they are rarely used.

When the client connects to a server, the server immediately sends a &quot;greeting&quot; message to the client. This message contains information about the server that the client needs to connect to. This contains the name of the server, the server&#x27;s current date and time in UTC, the supported features, and a privacy policy. The supported features include EPP versions, languages, objects, and extensions.

The session management commands are:

The query commands are:

The object transform commands are:
== Example ==
An example command to create a domain could look like this:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;epp xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;command&gt;
 &lt;create&gt;
 &lt;domain:create
 xmlns:domain=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;domain:name&gt;example.com&lt;/domain:name&gt;
 &lt;domain:period unit=&quot;y&quot;&gt;1&lt;/domain:period&gt;
 &lt;domain:ns&gt;
 &lt;domain:hostObj&gt;ns1.example.net&lt;/domain:hostObj&gt;
 &lt;domain:hostObj&gt;ns2.example.net&lt;/domain:hostObj&gt;
 &lt;/domain:ns&gt;
 &lt;domain:registrant&gt;REG-1738&lt;/domain:registrant&gt;
 &lt;domain:contact type=&quot;admin&quot;&gt;ADM-9374&lt;/domain:contact&gt;
 &lt;domain:contact type=&quot;tech&quot;&gt;OTH-2567&lt;/domain:contact&gt;
 &lt;domain:contact type=&quot;billing&quot;&gt;OTH-2567&lt;/domain:contact&gt;
 &lt;domain:authInfo&gt;
 &lt;domain:pw&gt;y85NS%FJ4zeKuHXo&lt;/domain:pw&gt;
 &lt;/domain:authInfo&gt;
 &lt;/domain:create&gt;
 &lt;/create&gt;
 &lt;clTRID&gt;uu28qbb2wo6o5bpk&lt;/clTRID&gt;
 &lt;/command&gt;
&lt;/epp&gt;
Note that the two host objects and three different contact objects had to be created beforehand to use them and the client had to be logged in already. The authInfo pw is a secret required in the transfer between registrars. The clTRID is a unique transaction ID for each command the client generates.

A server response to the command above could look like this:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;epp xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;response&gt;
 &lt;result code=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;
 &lt;msg&gt;Command completed successfully&lt;/msg&gt;
 &lt;/result&gt;
 &lt;resData&gt;
 &lt;domain:creData
 xmlns:domain=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;domain:name&gt;example.com&lt;/domain:name&gt;
 &lt;domain:crDate&gt;2023-03-12T12:00:00.0Z&lt;/domain:crDate&gt;
 &lt;domain:exDate&gt;2024-03-12T12:00:00.0Z&lt;/domain:exDate&gt;
 &lt;/domain:creData&gt;
 &lt;/resData&gt;
 &lt;trID&gt;
 &lt;clTRID&gt;uu28qbb2wo6o5bpk&lt;/clTRID&gt;
 &lt;svTRID&gt;ma3fuaeuh7bzpgv9&lt;/svTRID&gt;
 &lt;/trID&gt;
 &lt;/response&gt;
&lt;/epp&gt;
The clTRID is the same as the client sent, while the svTRID is a unique transaction ID the server generates. The server returns a result code, message, and additional result data, such as the expiration date of the newly created domain.

== Extensions ==
The protocol offers the ability to send an extension object on almost every possible command to enable registries to add new functionality without changing the base commands.

There are a few standardized extensions that are used by a lot of registries. These include extensions for DNSSEC, IDN, premium domain names, domain restoration (RGP) and extensions to handle the launch of new TLDs and Registry Maintenances among other things.

Some registries also developed extensions that are specific to their TLDs. A common use case for non-standardized extensions is collecting extra data needed to create a domain, for example, a VAT identification number.

== Result codes ==
All responses from the server have to follow a specified format. Each response code corresponds to a human-readable message. Codes in the format 1xxx are successful operations, while codes in the format 2xxx are errors. The errors are again divided into protocol syntax errors in the format 20xx, implementation-specific rules as 21xx, security as 22xx, data management as 23xx, server system as 24xx, and connection management as 25xx. Most results can include additional data in the resData object, for example, which required parameter is missing.

The response code 1001 enables offline processing, an example for this can be that a domain name registry wants to validate a registrant before the domain is registered. In this case, the domain is blocked for other clients until the process is complete, and the client will be notified via a poll message that the client can fetch via the poll command. The codes 1300 and 1301 are specifically for the poll command and signal whether there is a message.

The complete list of standardized result codes and result messages is:
==EPP object status codes==
There are two types of status codes: server and client. The difference is that all server status codes can only be set and removed by the registry, while the client status codes can also be set and removed by the registrar unless a server status code prohibits it.

The server status codes are commonly used to handle domain abuse cases, mark the domain lifecycle stage, or offer extra security against unauthorized tampering, a service often referred to as Registry-Lock.

The client status codes are commonly used also to handle abuse cases, non-payment, invalid contact data, or for a Registrar-Lock feature.

The currently standardized server status codes are:

The currently standardized client status codes are:
== Security considerations ==
EPP only offers plain text passwords, additionally the EPP login password type is specified to be a string of 6-16 character length which might be considered very low for today&#x27;s standards. Connections over TCP, therefore, must use TLS, and the use of client certificates, as well as correct identity confirmation of the client and server, is strongly encouraged.

Many domain name registries also offer to set up a IP whitelist for connecting to their EPP servers.

EPP offers some protection against replay attacks via the client generated clTRID, however this element is optional and is therefore not used by every server software. Therefore, additional anti-replay mechanisms should be implemented by the used transport mechanism.

<doc id="817650" wikidata="Q8464" url="?curid=817650" title="2004 Afghan presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Afghanistan on October 9, 2004. Hamid Karzai won the elections with 55% of the vote and three times more votes than any other candidate. Twelve candidates received less than 1% of the vote. It is estimated that more than three-quarters of Afghanistan&#x27;s nearly 12 million registered voters cast ballots. The elections were overseen by the Joint Electoral Management Body, chaired by Zakim Shah and vice-chaired by Ray Kennedy, an American working for the United Nations.

After some accusations of fraud circulated on the day of the election, at least fifteen candidates declared that they were boycotting the ballot, but the boycott dissolved when the United Nations announced it would set up a three-person independent panel to investigate the charges of irregularities. The panel included a former Canadian diplomat, a Swedish electoral expert, and the third member was later named by the European Union.

The date was originally set for July 5, 2004. The elections were twice postponed, first until September, and then until October. Candidates for president also nominated two vice-presidential candidates. Some candidates used this to balance their ticket with regard to Afghanistan&#x27;s three main ethnic communities. If no candidate had secured 50% of the votes, a run-off election would have been held.

==Candidates and issues==

Twenty-three candidates put their name forward for presidency, but five of them dropped out of the running by the time campaigning began.

The favourite throughout was interim president Hamid Karzai. Karzai ran as an independent, though he had the backing of several political parties, including Afghan Mellat, a social democratic party.

Initially, General Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord that led the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan and then became a member of the Afghan National Army in Karzai&#x27;s first interim government, was expected to be Karzai&#x27;s main challenger, but it soon became clear that his popularity was limited.

Yunus Qanuni, who served in several prominent positions in the interim government, instead emerged as the focus of opposition to Karzai. Qanuni, a leading member of the Northern Alliance, had the support of Mohammed Fahim, an interim vice-president who was dropped from the Karzai ticket during the campaign. Qanuni claimed to represent the legacy of Ahmad Shah Massoud, as did several other candidates (including Massoud&#x27;s brother, one of Karzai&#x27;s vice-presidential candidates).

Also running was Mohammed Mohaqiq. He was a leader of the Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan, a minister under Burhanuddin Rabbani and Karzai, and had been a strong ally of Dostum. Mohaqiq criticised Karzai as a weak leader and pledged to unite conflicting factions and end the drugs trade. He faced widespread accusations that he committed war crimes during the fight against the Soviet occupation, subsequent internecine conflict within the Mujahedin, and later, against the Taliban.

The youngest candidate was 41-year-old Abdul Hafiz Mansoor. He was a member of the Northern Alliance and claimant to the legacy of Massoud. A journalist and former Minister for Information and Culture, Mansoor accused Karzai of trying to form an elected dictatorship.

The main candidate of the religious right was Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai, leader of the exiled government in Pakistan during the Soviet occupation. Ahmadzai formerly led a radical Islamist group which was active in the Mujahedin, and later in both the Taleban and Al-Qaida, but has since disavowed any links with them.

Hamyon Shah Aasifi represented monarchist groups, although the former King, Mohammed Zahir Shah, has renounced his claims to be head of state.

Abdul Satar Sirat held several ministerial positions in the early 1970s. Sirat later served as envoy for the exiled King and was initially voted leader of the interim government but stepped aside in favour Karzai.

Massouda Jalal, a medical doctor, was the only female candidate, although two women were nominated for vice-president (Nelab Mobarez running with Aasifi and Shafiqa Habibi running with Dostum).

Several candidates publicly supported women&#x27;s rights, including Karzai, Wakil Mangal and, most prominently, the former police colonel Abdul Hasib Aarian. 72-year-old Abdul Hadi Khalilzai, the oldest candidate and a former teacher and religious lawyer, claimed to support women&#x27;s rights &quot;according to the Constitution, accepted Afghan tradition and the holy religion of Islam&quot;.

Latif Pedram, a journalist and poet, and Mohammed Ibrahim Rashid were strong advocates for the rights of Afghan refugees. Sayed Ishaq Gailani, a Muslim intellectual who fought against the Soviet occupation, stood to represent the Sufi Muslim minority. All candidates claimed to be able to build bridges between Afghanistan&#x27;s various communities and factions. Ghulam Farooq Nejrabi, a paediatric physician and medical lecturer who called for an end to religious, ethnic and sexual discrimination, even claimed he could build bridges with the Taleban. Mahfuz Nedahi, who had served as Minister of Mines and Industry in the interim government, accused the other candidates of running on tribal or party lines and failing to offer a true programme of national unity, while Sayed Abdul Hadi Dabir, an amateur boxer and former fighter in the Mujahedin, criticised tribal nepotism in government appointments and called for a national Ulema to be formed as part of the elected parliament.

==Campaigning and voting==
Ballots contained the names of candidates, accompanied by their photo and an icon of their choice. Where appropriate, the icon was the symbol of their political party. However, most candidates ran as independents regardless of their party affiliation, and selected generic icons to distinguish their candidacy. In order to avoid voting fraud, voters dipped their thumb in ink after they had cast their ballot.

In Afghanistan, polling centres opened at 6 am or 7 am in different areas, and were set to close at 4 pm. However, on election day, voting time was officially extended by two hours, but several polling centres closed on time before news of this announcement reached them.

Very significantly, over two million people voted among refugee communities in Iran and Pakistan, thanks to an operation conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) through a remarkable logistic effort. In Peshawar, Pakistan, under the leadership of Stuart Poucher, a small team from IOM managed in less than two months to hire over 400 electoral officers, and over 6,000 polling officials, to conduct voter education for over 800,000 refugees, over half of whom voted. 

==Controversies==
During the campaign there were some rumours that the election would be decided by negotiation, as candidates bargained for promises of political position under Karzai or another candidate in return for dropping out of the race. There were rumours in September that Sirat and Mohaqiq had formed a pact with Qanuni, whilst Gailani and Aarian declared their support for Karzai on the last day of campaigning, October 6.

All the candidates except Karzai, Gailani and Aarian, publicly declared that they were boycotting the ballot and would ignore the results— effectively uniting Karzai&#x27;s disparate opponents. Two major opposition candidates, the Hazara leader Mohammed Mohaqeq and the Uzbek strongman General Abdul Rashid Dostum, soon declared they had not joined the boycott.

===Election fraud===
Significant fraud occurred in the 2004 presidential election, even though it did not attract the level of international attention as the fraud in the 2009 presidential election.

On election day there were several claims that the ink used to mark voters could be easily removed and that multiple voting had resulted, as well as isolated reports of intimidation and campaigning at the polling centres.

Journalist Christian Parenti claimed that many people in Afghanistan were in possession of three or four photographic ID cards. He himself, not an Afghan citizen, could have easily voted. &quot;One of the parties gave me two valid voting cards,&quot; he said &quot;that I could add my photograph to and I could have voted if I wanted to.&quot; Other problems reported by Parenti included lack of pens in polling places, not having enough ballots, and differences in closing times of voting stations.

The documentary film &quot;God&#x27;s Open Hand&quot; by Ghost Studios exposes voter fraud. However, the film mainly focuses on the hopes and dreams of the Afghan people on their first ever presidential elections.

In September 2009, Hamid Karzai, downplaying the significance of the fraud in the 2009 presidential election, said &quot;there was fraud in 2004&quot; as well.

On September 3, 2009, when envoys from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and other Western nations met in Paris to discuss the recent 2009 Afghan election, UN Special Representative in Afghanistan Kai Eide said that the 2009 Afghan presidential election, widely characterized by rampant fraud and intimidation, &quot;was a better election than five years ago.&quot;

==Violence==
Rebels loyal to the former Taliban leadership had vowed to disrupt the election, accusing the United States moving to dominate the region. During the election process, five Afghan National Army soldiers died in skirmishes and due to landmines. Fifteen staff members of the Joint Electoral Management Body were killed and a further 46 injured in various attacks. Two international sub-contractors working in Nuristan in support of the electoral process were also killed.

<doc id="817653" wikidata="Q1573624" url="?curid=817653" title="Hypallage">
<text>Hypallage (; from the , &quot;hypallagḗ&quot;, &quot;interchange, exchange&quot;) is a figure of speech in which the syntactic relationship between two terms is interchanged, or – more frequently – a modifier is syntactically linked to an item other than the one that it modifies semantically. The latter type of hypallage, typically resulting in the implied personification of an inanimate or abstract noun, is also called a transferred epithet.

== Examples ==
* &quot;On the idle hill of summer/Sleepy with the flow of streams/Far I hear...&quot; (A.E. Housman, &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;) — &quot;Idle&quot;, although &quot;syntactically&quot; modifying &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;semantically&quot; describes the narrator, not the hill.
* &quot;Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time&quot; — Wilfred Owen, &quot;Dulce et Decorum Est&quot;
* &quot;Restless night&quot; — The night was not restless, but the person who was awake through it was.
* &quot;Happy morning&quot; — Mornings have no feelings, but the people who awaken to them do.
* &quot;Beside the clock&#x27;s loneliness&quot; - The clock is not lonely, but the poet is; from Ted Hughes&#x27; &quot;The Thought Fox&quot;. 
*&quot;While he&#x27;s waiting, Richard pops a nervous handful of salted nuts into his mouth.&quot; (A. M. Homes, &quot;This Book Will Save Your Life&quot;)
*&quot;Flying over the sleeping countryside&quot; — The countryside is not sleeping, the people living there are.
* &quot;Corruption reaps the young ...&quot; (Theodore Roethke, first line of &quot;Feud,&quot; in &quot;Open House&quot; (1941). Subject and object are interchanged: corruption does not reap the young, the young reap corruption (because of the feud).

== In other languages ==
Hypallage may be seen in Ancient Hebrew writings. Examples may include Book of Job 21:6, where &quot;my flesh seizes trembling&quot; seems to mean &quot;trembling seizes my flesh&quot; and Psalms 116:15, where &quot;precious in the eyes of the LORD is &quot;death&quot;, as to his faithful ones&quot; seems to mean &quot;the &quot;life&quot; of his faithful ones is precious in the eyes of the LORD,&quot; so he does not lightly let them die.

Hypallage is often used strikingly in Ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Examples of transferred epithets are &quot;the winged sound of whirling&quot; (), meaning &quot;the sound of whirling wings&quot; (Aristophanes, &quot;Birds&quot; 1198), and Horace&#x27;s &quot;angry crowns of kings&quot; (&quot;iratos...regum apices&quot;, &quot;Odes&quot; 3.21.19f.). Virgil was given to hypallage beyond the transferred epithet, as &quot;give the winds to the fleets&quot; (&quot;dare classibus Austros&quot;, &quot;Aeneid&quot; 3.61), meaning &quot;give the fleets to the winds.&quot;

Literary critic Gérard Genette argued that the frequent use of hypallage is characteristic of Marcel Proust&#x27;s style.

<doc id="817656" wikidata="Q5458407" url="?curid=817656" title="Fleet Marine Force Ribbon">
<text>The Navy Fleet Marine Force Service Ribbon, was a military award of the United States Navy established in 1984 by Secretary of the Navy, John F. Lehman, Jr. The service ribbon was awarded to eligible Navy personnel serving with the Marine Corps between 1984 and 2006. The award signified the acquisition of specific professional skills, knowledge and military experience that resulted in qualifications above those normally required of Navy personnel serving with the Fleet Marine Force (FMF). The FMF Ribbon was discontinued in the mid-2000s due to the promulgation of the FMF badges.

==History==
Qualification for the ribbon had to be obtained through a formal qualification program, and successful completion of a subsequent written test. To be eligible, Navy officer and enlisted personnel had to be assigned to an FMF unit. Only those personnel assigned to Type II and Type IV sea duty (i.e., deployable units) were eligible.

Additionally, officer and enlisted sailors had to complete sections of the Marine Battle Skills Training Handbook (Books 1, 2 and 4), which covered Military Justice and Law of War; Marine Corps Organization, History, Customs, and Courtesies; Marine Corps Uniform, Clothing and Equipment; Marine Corps General Leadership; Substance Abuse; Troop Information/Training Management; Combat Leadership; Individual Weapons (M16A2 Service Rifle, M9 Service Pistol); Tactical Measures; Hand Grenades, Mines, and Pyrotechnics; NBC Defense; First Aid and Field Sanitation; Land Navigation; Communication; and Maintain Physical Fitness. After completion, candidates had to pass a written exam on this material.

Enlisted active duty members of the Navy had to serve a minimum of 12 months (24 for Naval Reservists) with an FMF unit. Hospital corpsmen (HM) and dental technicians (DT) had to graduate from Field Medical Service School (FMSS). Religious program specialist (RP) had to graduate from Chaplain and RP Expeditionary Skills Training (CREST) course. Candidates in these three ratings had to obtain the appropriate Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) (HM 8404/DT 8707/RP 2401). Navy personnel assigned to an FMF unit, who have no Navy Enlisted Classification Code (NEC) producing pipeline school (i.e., yeoman, personnelman, disbursing clerk, etc.), were also eligible. Enlisted personnel could have no single performance trait mark below 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale), and no recommendation lower than promotable for the previous two periodic evaluations.

Finally, candidates had to pass the USMC Physical Fitness Test (PFT), which included timed performance of a three-mile run, sit-ups, and pull-ups.

The awarding authority could waive the above requirements in cases when Navy personnel demonstrate exceptional skill, knowledge, and leadership while providing support to the Marine Corps in a combat environment.

In the mid-1990s, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jeremy Boorda, granted the title (FMF) to enlisted personnel who had earned the ribbon, e.g., HM2 (FMF) John Doe, USN. This put the Navy FMF Ribbon on par with Navy enlisted warfare qualification breast insignia such as Surface Warfare, Air Warfare, Submarine, etc. The designation also provided the recipient two additional points toward advancement in rate. Although naval sailors who earned the FMF Ribbon can use the &quot;(FMF)&quot; designator after their rate, but they are not allowed to wear the FMF badge until re-qualifying by completing the battery of tests required to wear the FMF badge.

===Discontinuation===
Effective October 1, 2006, the Fleet Marine Force Ribbon became obsolete as a result of the creation and promulgation of the Fleet Marine Force Qualified Officer Insignia and Fleet Marine Force Enlisted Warfare Specialist Insignia programs a few years prior. However, those who were awarded the FMF Ribbon can continue to wear it.

<text>In the United States, a destructive device is a type of firearm or explosive device regulated by the National Firearms Act of 1934, revised by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and Gun Control Act of 1968.

Examples of destructive devices include grenades, grenade launchers, artillery weapons, and firearms (2) any type of weapon by whatever name known which will, or which may be readily converted to, expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or other propellant, the barrel or barrels of which have a bore over one half of an inch (.50 inches or 12.7 mm), excluding some rifles and most shotguns, both semi automatic and manually operated. While current federal laws allow destructive devices, some states have banned them from transfer to civilians. In states where banned, only law enforcement officers and military personnel are allowed to possess them.

All National Firearms Act firearms including destructive devices, must be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The definition of a &quot;destructive device&quot; is found in (f). The definition reads as follows:

: (1) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas, (A) bomb, (B) grenade, (C) rocket having a propellant charge of more than 4 ounces, (D) missile having an explosive charge of more than 1/4 ounce (109.4 grains or 7.09 grams), (E) mine or (F) similar device.

: (2) Any weapon by whatever name known which will, or which may be readily converted to, expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or other propellant, the barrel or barrels of which have a bore of more than one-half inch in diameter (.50 inches or 12.7 mm), except a shotgun or shotgun shell which the Secretary finds is generally recognized as particularly suitable for sporting purposes; and

: (3) Any combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into a destructive device as defined in subparagraphs (1) and (2) and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled.

: The term destructive device shall not include any device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon; any device, although originally designed for use as a weapon, which is redesigned for use as a signaling, pyrotechnic, line throwing, safety or similar device; surplus ordnance sold, loaned or given by the Secretary of the Army, pursuant to the provisions of section 4684(2), 4685, or 4686 of Title 10 of the United States Code; or any other device the Secretary finds is not likely to be used as a weapon, or is an antique or is a rifle which the owner intends to use solely for sporting purposes.

The term &quot;Secretary&quot; originally referred to the Secretary of the Treasury, as the National Firearms Act is part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986—since the BATF&#x27;s transfer to the Department of Justice in 2002, the term &quot;Secretary&quot; now refers to the Attorney General.

Muzzle-loading guns are not considered firearms in the US and do not fall under the regulations of the NFA. However, their projectiles may still be subject to NFA regulation. For instance, a person may manufacture, possess, and fire a black powder, muzzle-loading cannon of any bore diameter, but may not fire explosive shells from that cannon, as the explosive shell is itself defined as a destructive device.

<text>Pedro Celestino Joseph Negrete y Falla (14 May 1777 – 11 April 1846) was a Spanish politician and military man who served as a member of the interim government of Mexico after the abolition of the First Mexican Empire. He fought alongside of Agustín de Iturbide in the royalist army during the Mexican War of Independence. He was a close collaborator of Iturbide during the empire and then pressured him to abdicate the Mexican crown.

== Supreme Executive Power ==
In 1821, Pedro Celestino Negrete was a supporter of the Plan of Iguala. After Agustín de Iturbide had crowned himself Emperor of Mexico, he decided to lend his support to the Plan of Casa Mata and, using his friendship with Iturbide, exerted pressure for him to abdicate. Once Iturbide was dethroned, the executive authority was without representation and so Congress created a provisional government composed of General Pedro Celestino Negrete, General Nicolás Bravo and General Guadalupe Victoria; however, since the latter two were absent, José Mariano Michelena, Miguel Domínguez and General Vicente Guerrero were designated in their place. On 4 October 1824 the Constitution of the United Mexican States was promulgated, adopting the system of republican, representative, popular, federal government.

The country was divided into 19 free and sovereign states, 4 territories that depended on the center, and the Federal District. Also, the government was divided into legislative, executive and judicial branches. This Constitution was largely inspired by the checks and balances of the United States Constitution, of the French Constitution and the one of Cádiz. It was in force from 4 October 1824 to 30 April 1836, when it was replaced by Santa Anna&#x27;s centralist rewrite.

General Negrete chaired the Supreme Executive Power twice. The body ceded the executive on 10 October 1824, when General Guadalupe Victoria assumed the position as first President of Mexico. Although the fortress of San Juan de Ulúa — the last redoubt of Spanish power in Mexico, in the port of Veracruz — had been abandoned in 1825, some &quot;Peninsulares&quot; still entertained notions about restoring the monarchy, taking advantage of the general displeasure felt against the independent government. Thus, the friars Joaquín Arenas and Francisco Martínez, along with some Mexican and Spanish military officers, including Negrete and Echávarri, rebelled against the government of Guadalupe Victoria. On 9 January 1827 this conspiracy was discovered. The leaders were judged, the friars were sentenced to death and Negrete and Echávarri were exiled. Pedro Celestino Negrete left for France. He died in Bordeaux in 1846.

<doc id="817675" wikidata="Q488973" url="?curid=817675" title="Seo Taiji and Boys">
<text> () was a South Korean music group active from 1992 to 1996. The three members of the boy band, Seo Taiji, Yang Hyun-suk and Lee Juno, experimented with many different genres of popular Western music. Seo Taiji and Boys was highly successful and is credited with changing the South Korean music industry by pioneering the use of rap in Korean popular music and utilizing social critique, despite pressure from ethics and censorship committees.

The band won the Grand Prize at the Seoul Music Awards in both 1992 and 1993. In April 1996, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the band&#x27;s first three albums had each sold over 1.6 million copies, with the fourth nearing two million, making all four some of the best-selling albums in South Korea.

== History ==
After the breakup of the heavy metal band Sinawe in 1991, Seo Taiji switched gears and formed the group Seo Taiji and Boys with dancers and backing vocalists Yang Hyun-suk and Lee Juno. Yang said he first met Seo when the musician came to him to learn how to dance. &quot;Blown away&quot; by his music, Yang offered to join the group, and they later recruited Lee who was one of the top dancers in Korea and joined the group as a background dancer, despite being highly regarded in his own right, because the music &quot;moved [his] heart.&quot; Seo Taiji came across MIDI technology for the first time in South Korea in the early 1990s and started experimenting with different MIDI sounds to create a new type of music that had not been heard by the public. He initially had no plans to debut as a dance/pop boy group, and Seo Taiji and Boys&#x27; mainstream success was a surprise.

===1992: &quot;I Know&quot;===
The trio debuted on MBC&#x27;s talent show on April 11, 1992, with their song &quot;Nan Arayo&quot; (난 알아요, &quot;I Know&quot;) and got the lowest rating from the jury. However, the song and their self-titled debut album became so successful that, according to MTV Iggy, &quot;K-pop&quot; music would never be the same&quot; again. One of the first Korean rap songs, &quot;Nan Arayo&quot; was a hugely successful hit; its new jack swing-inspired beats, upbeat rap verses and pop-style choruses combined with a focus on new dance moves took Korean audiences by storm. Influenced by the videos for Technotronic&#x27;s &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; and Snap!&#x27;s &quot;The Power&quot;, the music video for &quot;Nan Arayo&quot; features varying color saturation and chroma key editing, varying the angles of the dancers&#x27; bodies constantly. The group sold over 1.5 million copies of the album within a month of its release, and Seo Taiji and Boys won a Golden Disc Award for &quot;Nan Arayo&quot; in 1992. &quot;Spin&quot; named &quot;Nan Arayo&quot; number 4 on their 2012 list of the 21 Greatest K-Pop Songs of All Time. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it number 36 on its list of the 50 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time. &quot;Nan Arayo&quot; is also recognized for establishing the popularity of rap in K-pop and hybridizing the Korean ballad style with rap, rock, and techno.

===1993: &quot;Hayeoga&quot;===

Their 1993 second album took a different turn. Although remaining a mostly dance album, a few songs such as &quot;Hayeoga&quot; (하여가, 何如歌, &quot;Anyhow Song&quot;) combined elements of heavy metal and traditional Korean folk music through the use of the taepyeongso, a double-reed wind instrument, and melodic structure. While there was controversy that the guitar solo in the middle of the song plagiarized Testament&#x27;s &quot;First Strike is Deadly&quot;, the guitarist for the solo, Lee Tae-Seop, mentioned in an interview that the solo&#x27;s arpeggios reinterpreted Scandinavian folk songs, which had no copyright. &quot;Hayeoga&quot; earned them their second Golden Disc Award. Moreover, while promoting the album, the group was banned from appearing on the national television channel KBS-TV because they wore earrings, ripped jeans and had dreadlocks, which ethics committees associated with reggae, resistance movements, and rejection of social norms (although their brightly dyed long hair in 1995 did not attract a similar ban). This was the first of the numerous controversies regarding Seo Taiji and Boys. The band&#x27;s second album became the first &#x27;double million sellers&#x27; album in Korean history.

===1994: &quot;Classroom Idea&quot;===
The third album shifted to a more heavy metal and rock style. Danceable tunes were nearly non-existent except &quot;Dreaming of Bal-Hae&quot; (), an alternative rock song indicating a hope of reuniting North and South Korea, which earned the group its third Golden Disc Award. Instead, songs such as the controversial &quot;Classroom Idea&quot; () with death growl vocals, influenced by bands such as the Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine, by Ahn Heung-Chan of Crash took center stage. The song was extremely critical of the Korean education system and the pressure placed on youth to succeed academically, such as doing well on university entrance exams. The song was banned from being played on TV and radio (but passed by ethics committees) for the censuring of the education system in its lyrics:Every morning you lead us into a tiny classroom by 7:30, forcing the same things into the 7 million heads of children around the country. These dark, closed classrooms are swallowing us up. My life is too precious to be wasted here.Additionally, the band was accused of backmasking Satanic messages in the song. Although the mainstream news media later proved these accusations to be groundless, the moral panic proved difficult to eliminate.

===1995: &quot;Regret of the Times&quot;===

Not backing down, Seo Taiji and Boys&#x27; fourth album exploded with more controversial songs. &quot;Come Back Home&quot; was a foray into gangsta rap, featuring a high-pitched nasal voice influenced by B-Real of Cypress Hill in &quot;Insane in the Brain&quot; and by House of Pain. &quot;Pilseung&quot; (필승, 必勝, &quot;Certain Victory&quot;) was also a hit with alternative rock sound and shouting voice reminiscent of House of Pain&#x27;s &quot;Jump Around&quot;. However, &quot;Regret of the Times&quot; () was banned by the Public Performance Ethics Committee for having lyrics that criticized the government. The version of the song included on the album is instrumental only, as a refusal by Seo to rewrite or remove the original three lines that the Ethics Committee demanded be changed (in bold): Educated elders are walking down the street holding pretty dolls. It seems that the day everyone has been secretly hoping for is coming today. Lips stained black. [...] [...] Tonight!The backlash from the fans was immense, and the system of &quot;pre-censorship&quot; (사전심의제) was abolished in June 1996, partially as a result of this reaction. An EP titled &quot;Regret of the Times&quot; including the original version of the song was released a month after the system was abolished.

===1996: Retirement===

Seo Taiji and Boys retired from South Korea&#x27;s popular music scene in January 1996 during its heyday. Lee later stated that Seo made the decision to disband while recording their fourth album, much to the surprise of Yang and himself. The band&#x27;s announcement of retirement was a huge disappointment for millions of fans in Korea. The compilation album &quot;Goodbye Best Album&quot; was released later that year.

Seo Taiji headed over to the United States soon after, while Lee Juno and Yang Hyun-suk established record labels right after their retirement. Yang Hyun-suk was successful in founding YG Entertainment, one of the three biggest record companies in the country. Seo Taiji returned to music two years later with a very successful solo career; he is now referred to as &quot;the President of culture&quot; in South Korea. In 2007, all four of Seo Taiji and Boys&#x27; albums were included in &quot;Kyunghyang Shinmun&quot;″s Top 100 Pop Albums, with their first ranking the highest at number 24.

In 2014, when asked about a possible Seo Taiji and Boys reunion, Seo revealed that the three members had talked about it often. However, he said:The biggest obstacle is that in the past, we put on really beautiful performances, which fans remember, but if we get back together now, I worry we might disappoint, so I am not confident. I lack more and more confidence as I get older. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to dance as fiercely as I had in the past.

== Impact and legacy ==

By incorporating these musical elements with Korea&#x27;s ballad music, Seo Taiji and Boys provided the basis for the hybridization of Korea&#x27;s music with that of the West, resulting in the foundation of modern K-pop. This hybridization of music and foregrounding of dance movements was one of the fundamental reasons for the popularity of Korean popular music, especially among teenage and early 20s listeners, as it also promoted Korean popular music&#x27;s ability to penetrate foreign markets in what has become known as the Korean Wave. Doobo Shim, a researcher of Asian culture, credits Seo Taiji and Boys with creating the &quot;distinctively Korean pop style&quot; which became commonplace. Moreover, the band was voted as the most crucial Korean cultural product in a survey conducted by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in 1997.

Seo Taiji and Boys acted as an instrument of change within Korea, challenging censorship laws as well as the television networks hegemony over the music market. In 1995 the Korean Broadcasting Ethics Committee demanded that Seo Taiji and Boys change the lyrics for &quot;Shidae Yugam&quot;. This incited protests and resulted in the abolishment of music pre-censorship in Korea. Seo Taiji also did not have to rely on television networks due to the fact that he owned his own studio. This autonomy allowed Seo to bring subcultures in Korea, such as heavy metal, to the forefront of popular culture and challenge pervasive social norms. The band&#x27;s independent success diminished the power of the television networks to dictate which artists appeared on shows, and gave rise to the influence of record labels and talent agencies. Such companies led to the formation of bands such as H.O.T., Sechs Kies, Uptown, and Shinhwa.

Additionally, Seo Taiji and Boys&#x27; fashion contrasted sharply with the convention at the time. The band members&#x27; style ranged from wearing tailored jackets and neat dress shirts to street fashion. They incorporated traditional Korean folk costumes and Scottish kilts, showcasing a variety of cultures. Seo Taiji and Boys pioneered the &quot;snowboard look&quot;, which included dark sunglasses, ski hats, and large parkas. Furthermore, the band members&#x27; wearing of dreadlocks in 1993 caused a reactionary ban of the band on national television.

Another aspect of Korean pop that Seo Taiji and Boys influenced was dance. The band was the first to turn dance into a dominant feature in performance by including breakdancing routines. Dancer Nam Hyun-joon cites Seo Taiji and Boys as a primary influence, and appeared in one of band member Lee Juno&#x27;s music videos.

Celebrating the Seo Taiji and Boys&#x27; 25th anniversary project &quot;Time: Traveler&quot;, the band BTS remade &quot;Come Back Home&quot; in 2017, reflecting a similar sentiment to the societal change that Seo argued for in his songs. While maintaining the gangsta rap style, J-Hope raps: &quot;I feel suffocated in my life. What is blocking my life is my fear towards tomorrow,&quot; while RM adds, &quot;Because we are still young, there&#x27;s a decent future. Now wipe those old tears and come back home.&quot; While Seo&#x27;s social critique of Korean culture was predated by songs of Kim Min-ki, who focused on political violence during the Fourth Republic of Korea under the leader Park Chung Hee, Seo&#x27;s songs included more direct lyrics and maintained his musical identity by refusing to acquiesce to the pre-censorship policies of the time. In fact, his artistry was unhampered by marketing and advertising campaigns, which may have contributed to the band&#x27;s success.

<text>The lunar maria ( ; mare ) are large, dark, basaltic plains on Earth&#x27;s Moon, formed by lava flowing into ancient impact basins. They were dubbed by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas. They are less reflective than the &quot;highlands&quot; as a result of their iron-rich composition, and hence appear dark to the naked eye. The maria cover about 16% of the lunar surface, mostly on the side visible from Earth. The few maria on the far side are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one (ocean), as well as features with the names (&#x27;lake&#x27;), (&#x27;marsh&#x27;), and (&#x27;bay&#x27;). The last three are smaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics.

The names of maria refer to sea features (Mare Humorum, Mare Imbrium, Mare Insularum, Mare Nubium, Mare Spumans, Mare Undarum, Mare Vaporum, Oceanus Procellarum, Mare Frigoris), sea attributes (Mare Australe, Mare Orientale, Mare Cognitum, Mare Marginis), or states of mind (Mare Crisium, Mare Ingenii, Mare Serenitatis, Mare Tranquillitatis). Mare Humboldtianum and Mare Smythii were established before the final nomenclature, that of states of mind, was accepted, and do not follow this pattern. When Mare Moscoviense was discovered by the Luna 3, and the name was proposed by the Soviet Union, it was only accepted by the International Astronomical Union with the justification that Moscow is a state of mind.

==Ages==
The ages of the mare basalts have been determined both by direct radiometric dating and by the technique of crater counting. The radiometric ages range from about 3.16 to 4.2 billion years old (Ga), whereas the youngest ages determined from crater counting are about 1.2 Ga. Updated measurements of samples collected by the Chang’e-5 mission show that some lunar basalts could be as young as 2.03 billion years old. Nevertheless, the majority of mare basalts appear to have erupted between about 3 and 3.5 Ga. The few basaltic eruptions that occurred on the far side are old, whereas the youngest flows are found within Oceanus Procellarum on the nearside. While many of the basalts either erupted within, or flowed into, low-lying impact basins, the largest expanse of volcanic units, Oceanus Procellarum, does not correspond to any known impact basin.
==Distribution of basalts==
There are many common misconceptions concerning the spatial distribution of mare basalts. 
#Since many mare basalts fill low-lying impact basins, it was once assumed that the impact event itself somehow caused the volcanic eruption. Note: current data in fact may not preclude this, although the timing and length of mare volcanism in a number of basins cast some doubt on it. Initial mare volcanism generally seems to have begun within 100 million years of basin formation. Although these authors felt that 100 million years was sufficiently long that a correlation between impact and volcanism seemed unlikely, there are problems with this argument. The authors also point out that the oldest and deepest basalts in each basin are likely buried and inaccessible, leading to a sampling bias.
#It is sometimes suggested that the gravity field of the Earth might preferentially allow eruptions to occur on the near side, but not on the far side. However, in a reference frame rotating with the Moon, the centrifugal acceleration the Moon is experiencing is exactly equal and opposite to the gravitational acceleration of the Earth. There is thus no net force directed towards the Earth. The Earth tides do act to deform the shape of the Moon, but this shape is that of an elongated ellipsoid with high points at both the sub- and anti-Earth points. As an analogy, there are two high tides per day on Earth, and not one.
#Since mare basaltic magmas are denser than upper crustal anorthositic materials, basaltic eruptions might be favored at locations of low elevation where the crust is thin. However, the far side South Pole–Aitken basin contains the lowest elevations of the Moon and yet is only sparingly filled by basaltic lavas. In addition, the crustal thickness beneath this basin is predicted to be much smaller than beneath Oceanus Procellarum. While the thickness of the crust might modulate the quantity of basaltic lavas that ultimately reach the surface, crustal thickness by itself cannot be the sole factor controlling the distribution of mare basalts.
#It is commonly suggested that there is some form of link between the synchronous rotation of the Moon about the Earth, and the mare basalts. However, gravitational torques that result in tidal despinning only arise from the moments of inertia of the body (these are directly relatable to the spherical harmonic degree-2 terms of the gravity field), and the mare basalts hardly contribute to this (see also tidal locking). (Hemispheric structures correspond to spherical harmonic degree 1, and do not contribute to the moments of inertia.) Furthermore, tidal despinning is predicted to have occurred quickly (in the order of thousands of years), whereas the majority of mare basalts erupted about one billion years later.

The reason that the mare basalts are predominantly located on the near-side hemisphere of the Moon is still being debated by the scientific community. Based on data obtained from the Lunar Prospector mission, it appears that a large proportion of the Moon&#x27;s inventory of heat producing elements (in the form of KREEP) is located within the regions of Oceanus Procellarum and the Imbrium basin, a unique geochemical province now referred to as the Procellarum KREEP Terrane. While the enhancement in heat production within the Procellarum KREEP Terrane is most certainly related to the longevity and intensity of volcanism found there, the mechanism by which KREEP became concentrated within this region is not agreed upon.

== Chemical composition ==
Using terrestrial classification schemes, all mare basalts are classified as tholeiitic, but specific subclassifications have been invented to further describe the population of lunar basalts. Mare basalts are generally grouped into three series based on their major element chemistry: &quot;high-Ti basalts&quot;, &quot;low-Ti basalts&quot;, and &quot;very-low-Ti (VLT) basalts&quot;. While these groups were once thought to be distinct based on the Apollo samples, global remote sensing data from the Clementine mission now shows that there is a continuum of titanium concentrations between these end members, and that the high-titanium concentrations are the least abundant. TiO2 abundances can reach up to 15 wt.% for mare basalts, whereas most terrestrial basalts have abundances much less than 4 wt.%. A special group of lunar basalts is the KREEP basalts, which are abnormally rich in potassium (K), rare-earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (P). A major difference between terrestrial and lunar basalts is the near-total absence of water in any form in the lunar basalts. Lunar basalts do not contain hydrogen-bearing minerals like the amphiboles and phyllosilicates that are common in terrestrial basalts due to alteration or metamorphism.

<text>Thixotropy is a time-dependent shear thinning property. Certain gels or fluids that are thick or viscous under static conditions will flow (become thinner, less viscous) over time when shaken, agitated, shear-stressed, or otherwise stressed (time-dependent viscosity). They then take a fixed time to return to a more viscous state.
Some non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity. A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a steep change in shear rate. Some thixotropic fluids return to a gel state almost instantly, such as ketchup, and are called pseudoplastic fluids. Others such as yogurt take much longer and can become nearly solid. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated. Thixotropy arises because particles or structured solutes require time to organize.

Some fluids are anti-thixotropic: constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification. Fluids which exhibit this property are sometimes called rheopectic. Anti-thixotropic fluids are less well documented than thixotropic fluids.

== History ==
Many sources of thixotropy comes from the studies of Bauer and Collins as the earliest source of origin. Later in 1923, other researchers began experimenting with thixotropy and then began reporting that many gels consist of aqueous Fe2O3 dispersions.

These researchers, Mewis and Barnes, Schalek and Szegvari, and H. Freundlich, then learned that they could make the gel turn into a liquid simply by shaking the contents. The more that was learned of this material has been found in numerous other products without the realization of the people making said products. 

==Natural examples==
Some clays are thixotropic, influenced by thermochemical treatment, and their behaviour is of great importance in structural and geotechnical engineering. Landslides, such as those common in the cliffs around Lyme Regis, Dorset and in the Aberfan spoil tip disaster in Wales are evidence of this phenomenon. Similarly, a lahar is a mass of earth liquefied by a volcanic event, which rapidly solidifies once coming to rest.

Drilling muds used in geotechnical applications can be thixotropic. Honey from honey bees may also exhibit this property under certain conditions (such as heather honey or mānuka honey).

Both cytoplasm and the ground substance in the human body are thixotropic, as is semen.

Some clay deposits found in the process of exploring caves exhibit thixotropism: an initially solid-seeming mudbank will turn soupy and yield up moisture when dug into or otherwise disturbed. These clays were deposited in the past by low-velocity streams which tend to deposit fine-grained sediment.

A thixotropic fluid is best visualised by an oar blade embedded in mud. Pressure on the oar often results in a highly viscous (more solid) thixotropic mud on the high pressure side of the blade, and low viscosity (very fluid) thixotropic mud on the low pressure side of the oar blade. Flow from the high pressure side to the low pressure side of the oar blade is non-Newtonian. (i.e., fluid velocity is not linearly proportional to the square root of the pressure differential over the oar blade).

==Applications==

Many kinds of paints and inks—e.g., plastisols used in silkscreen textile printing—exhibit thixotropic qualities. In many cases it is desirable for the fluid to flow sufficiently to form a uniform layer, then to resist further flow, thereby preventing sagging on a vertical surface. Some other inks, such as those used in CMYK-type process printing, are designed to regain viscosity even faster, once they are applied, in order to protect the structure of the dots for accurate color reproduction.

There are several methods to using thixotropy; one method, the most popular way, is to use a two-phase mixture to model to allow the mixture to continue without added equations entering when thixotropy is working through its process on the different materials.

Thixotropic ink (along with a gas pressurized cartridge and special shearing ball design) is a key feature of the Fisher Space Pen, used for writing during zero gravity space flights by the US and Russian space programs.

Solder pastes used in electronics manufacturing printing processes are thixotropic.

Thread-locking fluid is a thixotropic adhesive that cures anaerobically.

Thixotropy has been proposed as a scientific explanation of blood liquefaction miracles such as that of Saint Januarius in Naples.

Semi-solid casting processes such as thixomoulding use the thixotropic property of some alloys (mostly light metals like magnesium). Within certain temperature ranges and with appropriate preparation, an alloy can be put into a semi-solid state, which can be injected with less shrinkage and better overall properties than by normal injection molding.

Fumed silica is commonly used as a rheology agent to make otherwise low-viscous fluids thixotropic. Examples range from foods to epoxy resin in structural bonding applications like fillet joints.

== Common use ==
Thixotropy has shown to be useful in many ways concerning cement paste. The thixotropy allows the cement to be broken down in a way that allows the user to slowly put down the paste in a controlled manner so it can then be set and dry.

Thixotropy is also used in drilling fluids due to their rheological makeup. This however is connected to drilling hydraulics and how thixotropy affects the process of hydraulics.

== Negative effects ==
While thixotropy has been seen to benefit in areas pertaining to clay and cement, the material also comes with many harmful effects. To try and prevent thixotropy from fracturing the sustainability of the concrete, catatonic polymer began to be used in order to counteract the thixotropy, however this agent is needed in order to allow the mixing of the clay and cementitious material. There is now no true way to counteract the effect of thixotropy while also allowing it to break down the materials in the cement and clay.

==Etymology==
The word comes from Ancient Greek θίξις &quot;thixis&quot; &#x27;touch&#x27; (from &quot;thinganein&quot; &#x27;to touch&#x27;) and &quot;-tropy&quot;, &quot;-tropous&quot;, from Ancient Greek -τρόπος &quot;-tropos&quot; &#x27;of turning&#x27;, from τρόπος &quot;tropos&quot; &#x27;a turn&#x27;, from τρέπειν &quot;trepein&quot;, &#x27;to turn, change&#x27;. Hence, it can be translated as something that turns (or changes) when touched. It was invented by Herbert Freundlich originally for a sol-gel transformation.

<text>The Yangtze Service Medal is a decoration of the United States military which was created in 1930 for presentation to members of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps (and to a lesser extent, members of the United States Army). The Yangtze Service Medal is awarded for service in the Yangtze River Valley between September 3, 1926 and December 31, 1932, a period of significant unrest in the region.

The decoration may also be awarded for those military service members who served on permanent duty in Shanghai, China, provided such service was in direct support of landing operations in the Yangtze River Valley (e.g. Nanking incident of 1927). The Yangtze Service Medal was declared obsolete in 1940 when it was replaced by the China Service Medal.

The designer of the Yangtze Service Medal is John R. Sinnock of the Philadelphia Mint. Sinnock was the eighth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1925 to 1947.

<text>The Nord Lead is a series of virtual analog subtractive synthesizers, manufactured by Clavia.

Released in 1995, the original Nord Lead popularized the term &quot;virtual analog synthesis&quot;. The phrase was coined by Clavia at the release of the Nord Lead. This synthesizer is distinctive for its red body, knob-laden surface, and unique pitch-stick and modulation wheel. The model received several updates, including the Nord Lead 2, Nord Lead 3, and Nord Lead 2X.

==Models==
===Nord Lead===

The first Nord Lead was released in 1995 to positive reviews. It was created with the help of Peter Jubel, who also co-founded Propellerhead Software. Compared to synthesizers being constructed via analog components, the Nord Lead uses digital signal processors (DSPs) programmed to emulate both Subtractive and analogue FM synthesis (cross-modulation) to reproduce the warmth and richness of a traditional analog sound. The Nord Lead was also unusual for its time in being &quot;covered in knobs&quot;, which gave the player a direct access to all sound parameters without having to walk through editing menus.

The Nord Lead featured four notes of polyphony. A later hardware upgrade increased the polyphony to twelve voices. The expansion also added PCMCIA card storage of patches and a drum map feature.


===Nord Lead 2===

The Clavia Nord Lead 2 was launched in 1997, two years after the production of the original Nord Lead. It updated the polyphony from four to 16 voices.
Also added were a ring modulator, OSC 1 sync-able with the white noise generator, Sine waveform added for OSC 1, increased LFO and arpeggiator waveforms and patterns, filter distortion and 4 individual outputs. Patch storage was also increased. A PCMCIA storage slot was also added.

===Nord Lead 3===

The Nord Lead 3 was a more advanced version introduced in 2001, with many new features like 4 operator FM Synthesis (Sinus Modulation), and an arpeggiator. The most visible new feature was replacing all the control knobs with endless rotary knobs surrounded by a lighted indicating collar to show the current setting. The Nord Lead 3 was however much more expensive than the Nord Lead 2, so the Nord Lead 2 and later Nord Lead 2X was sold in parallel to this flagship product. The Nord Lead 3 was discontinued in 2007, leaving the Nord Lead 2X the only remaining product in the Nord Lead series.

===Nord Lead 2X===

In 2003 Clavia introduced the 2X, a refresh of the Nord Lead 2. It included increased polyphony (20 voice), high-resolution 24-bit 96 kHz DACs, and vastly expanded patch memory. The PCMCIA patch storage was removed. The 2X retains the synthesis engine of its predecessor and consequently its sound characteristics.

====Nord Lead 2X Anniversary Edition====
In 2008, Clavia released a special limited edition of the Lead 2X with inverted key colors (black keys and white sharps/flats) and special logos to commemorate the 25-year history of the Clavia company. Each unit (of only 300) came with an individually numbered certificate.

===Nord Lead 4===
In 2013 Clavia announced the Nord Lead 4 at the annual Musikmesse show in Germany. The new variant boasts an updated sound engine, new filter sections and a &quot;True Voice Unison&quot; mode which can support up to 4 oscillators simultaneously. Furthermore, similar to the Nord Wave, the Lead 4 has a dedicated FX section featuring reverb, delay, crush and distortion. The ability to quickly edit sounds whilst performing live is made possible as a result of the new &quot;variation&quot; controls in which the user can map up to 7 control parameters per program. Also similar to the Nord Wave, the Lead 4 supports MIDI I/O over USB 2.0.

===Nord Lead A1===
At the 2014 NAMM Show, Clavia announced the Nord Lead A1. The model attempts to make the Nord Lead line accessible to a wider user base, with a new oscillator interface and numerous enhancements intended to facilitate quick and creative sound design.

<doc id="817715" wikidata="Q7987528" url="?curid=817715" title="Western Australian Internet Exchange">
<text>The Western Australian Internet Exchange (WAIX) was formed in 1997 as a neutral Internet exchange point in Perth, Western Australia. Its three founding members were iiNet, Omen Internet and Wantree Internet. Today WAIX has some 100 peers and facilitates the transfer of over 50 gigabits per second.

The exchange is operated by the Internet Association of Australia, a not-for-profit, member driven, licensed telecommunications carrier. WAIX is the longest running exchange point in Australia. The Association operates Internet Exchange Points across Australia.

Originally located only in the QV.1 building in central Perth, and now in numerous locations across Perth, most Western Australian ISPs also peer at the facility.

==Brief history==

The peering fabric first existed informally as links between &quot;Wantree Internet&quot; and &quot;Omen Internet&quot; to iiNet. WAIX was formalised as an initiative by the then Western Australian Internet Association (which became the Internet Association of Australia) after a presentation by Andrew Khoo on his similar work in Sydney and Melbourne to create multi-lateral peering fabrics in both cities. The ISPs at the presentation later agreed they could form the fabric themselves and did so by leasing a small room in QV.1 and began as a formal peering exchange after Omen, iiNet and Wantree moved their interconnects into the peering room.

Various attempts were made over the first few years to arrange traffic exchange between peers at WAIX and peers at other Australian internet exchanges (notably the South Australia Internet Exchange) allowing peers to pay for interstate traffic. This was an arrangement with one of the peers at the time who peered at more than one Australian peering fabric. Similar arrangements were formalised in the eastern states with the formation of AusBone.

==History==

It is known that modern-day Circassians also called Kassogs were inhabiting Kabardino Balkaria since at least the 6th century BCE, then known as Zichia. On 1 July 1994 Kabardino-Balkaria became the second republic after Tatarstan to sign a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy.

==Politics==
The head of government in Kabardino-Balkaria is the Head. The current Head is Kazbek Kokov. The legislative body of the Republic is the Parliament comprising 72 deputies elected for a five-year term.

The republic adopted a new constitution in 2001 which prevents the republic from existing independently of the Russian Federation.

===Ethnic groups===
Kabardino-Balkaria includes two major ethnic communities, the Kabardins (Circassians), who speak a North-West Caucasian language, and the Balkars who speak a Turkic language. According to the 2021 Census, Kabardins make up 57.1% of the republic&#x27;s population, followed by Russians (19.8%) and Balkars (13.7%). Other groups include Cherkess (3.0%), Turks (1.9%), Ossetians (0.8%), Romani (0.5%), and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population.

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey which interviewed 56,900 people, 70.8% of the population of Kabardino-Balkaria adhered to Islam, 11.6% to the Russian Orthodox Church, 3.8% were non-Orthodox Christians, and 1.8% followed Adyghe (Kabardian) folk religion and other indigenous faiths. In addition, 12% of the population declared to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot; and 5.6% was atheist or followed other religions, including Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

<text>In labor economics, an efficiency wage is a wage paid in excess of the market-clearing wage to increase the labor productivity of workers. Specifically, it points to the incentive for managers to pay their employees more than the market-clearing wage to increase their productivity or to reduce the costs associated with employee turnover.

Theories of efficiency wages explain the existence of involuntary unemployment in economies outside of recessions, providing for a natural rate of unemployment above zero. Because workers are paid more than the equilibrium wage, workers may experience periods of unemployment in which workers compete for a limited supply of well-paying jobs.

==Overview of theory==
There are several reasons why managers may pay efficiency wages:

* &quot;Avoiding shirking&quot;: If it is difficult to measure the quantity or quality of a worker&#x27;s effortand systems of piece rates or commissions are impossible, there may be an incentive for the worker to &quot;shirk&quot; (do less work than agreed). The manager thus may pay an efficiency wage in order to create or increase the cost of job loss, which gives a sting to the threat of firing. This threat can be used to prevent shirking.
* &quot;Minimizing turnover&quot;: By paying above-market wages, the worker&#x27;s motivation to leave the job and look for a job elsewhere will be reduced. This strategy also reduces the expense of training replacement workers.
* &quot;Selection&quot;: If job performance depends on workers&#x27; ability and workers differ from each other in those terms, firms with higher wages will attract more able job-seekers, and this may make it profitable to offer wages that exceed the market clearing level.
* &quot;Sociological theories&quot;: Efficiency wages may result from traditions. Akerlof&#x27;s theory (in very simple terms) involves higher wages encouraging high morale, which raises productivity.
* &quot;Nutritional theories&quot;: In developing countries, efficiency wages may allow workers to eat well enough to avoid illness and to be able to work harder and even more productively.

The model of efficiency wages, largely based on shirking, developed by Carl Shapiro and Joseph E. Stiglitz has been particularly influential.

==Shirking==
A theory in which employers voluntarily pay employees above the market equilibrium level to increase worker productivity. The shirking model begins with the fact that complete contracts rarely (or never) exist in the real world. This implies that both parties to the contract have some discretion, but frequently, due to monitoring problems, the employee&#x27;s side of the bargain is subject to the most discretion. Methods such as piece rates are often impracticable because monitoring is too costly or inaccurate; or they may be based on measures too imperfectly verifiable by workers, creating a moral hazard problem on the employer&#x27;s side. Thus, paying a wage in excess of market-clearing may provide employees with cost-effective incentives to work rather than shirk.

In the Shapiro and Stiglitz model, workers either work or shirk, and if they shirk they have a certain probability of being caught, with the penalty of being fired. Equilibrium then entails unemployment, because to create an opportunity cost to shirking, firms try to raise their wages above the market average (so that sacked workers face a probabilistic loss). But since all firms do this, the market wage itself is pushed up, and the result is that wages are raised above market-clearing, creating involuntary unemployment. This creates a low, or no income alternative, which makes job loss costly and serves as a worker discipline device. Unemployed workers cannot bid for jobs by offering to work at lower wages since, if hired, it would be in the worker&#x27;s interest to shirk on the job, and he has no credible way of promising not to do so. Shapiro and Stiglitz point out that their assumption that workers are identical (e.g. there is no stigma to having been fired) is a strong one – in practice, reputation can work as an additional disciplining device. Conversely, higher wages and unemployment increase the cost of finding a new job after being laid off. So in the shirking model, higher wages are also a monetary incentive.

Shapiro-Stiglitz&#x27;s model holds that unemployment threatens workers, and the stronger the danger, the more willing workers are to work through correct behavior. This view illustrates the endogenous decision-making of workers in the labor market; that is, workers will be more inclined to work hard when faced with the threat of unemployment to avoid the risk of unemployment. In the labor market, many factors influence workers&#x27; behavior and supply. Among them, the threat of unemployment is an essential factor affecting workers&#x27; behavior and supply. When workers are at risk of losing their jobs, they tend to increase their productivity and efficiency by working harder, thus improving their chances of employment. This endogenous decision of behavior and supply can somewhat alleviate the unemployment problem in the labor market.

The shirking model does not predict that the bulk of the unemployed at any one time are those fired for shirking, because if the threat associated with being fired is effective, little or no shirking and sacking will occur. Instead, the unemployed will consist of a rotating pool of individuals who have quit for personal reasons, are new entrants to the labour market, or have been laid off for other reasons. Pareto optimality, with costly monitoring, will entail some unemployment since unemployment plays a socially valuable role in creating work incentives. But the equilibrium unemployment rate will not be Pareto optimal since firms do not consider the social cost of the unemployment they helped to create.

One criticism of the efficiency wage hypothesis is that more sophisticated employment contracts can, under certain conditions, reduce or eliminate involuntary unemployment. The use of seniority wages to solve the incentive problem, where initially, workers are paid less than their marginal productivity, and as they work effectively over time within the firm, earnings increase until they exceed marginal productivity. The upward tilt in the age-earnings profile here provides the incentive to avoid shirking, and the present value of wages can fall to the market-clearing level, eliminating involuntary unemployment. The slope of earnings profiles is significantly affected by incentives.

However, a significant criticism is that moral hazard would be shifted to employers responsible for monitoring the worker&#x27;s efforts. Employers do not want employees to be lazy. Employers want employees to be able to do more work while getting their reserved wages. Obvious incentives would exist for firms to declare shirking when it has not taken place. In the Lazear model, firms have apparent incentives to fire older workers (paid above marginal product) and hire new cheaper workers, creating a credibility problem. The seriousness of this employer moral hazard depends on how much effort can be monitored by outside auditors, so that firms cannot cheat. However, reputation effects (e.g. Lazear 1981) may be able to do the same job.

==Labor turnover==

&quot;Labor turnover&quot; refers to rapid changes in the workforce from one position to another. This is determined by the ratio of the size of the labor and the number of employees employed. With regards to the efficiency wage hypothesis, firms also offer wages in excess of market-clearing, due to the high cost of replacing workers (search, recruitment, training costs). If all firms are identical, one possible equilibrium involves all firms paying a common wage rate above the market-clearing level, with involuntary unemployment serving to diminish turnover. These models can easily be adapted to explain dual labor markets: if low-skill, labor-intensive firms have lower turnover costs (as seems likely), there may be a split between a low-wage, low-effort, high-turnover sector and a high-wage, high effort, low-turnover sector. Again, more sophisticated employment contracts may solve the problem.

==Selection==
Similar to the shirking model, the selection model also believes that the information asymmetry problem is the main culprit that causes the market function not fully to exert to eliminate involuntary unemployment. However, unlike the shirking model, which focuses on employee shirking, the election model emphasizes the information disadvantage of employers in terms of labor quality. Due to the inability to accurately observe the real quality of employees, we only know that high wages can hire high-quality employees, and wage cuts will make high-quality employees go first. Therefore, wages will not continue to fall due to involuntary unemployment to maintain the excellent quality of workers.

In selection wage theories it is presupposed that performance on the job depends on &quot;ability&quot;, and that workers are heterogeneous concerning ability. The selection effect of higher wages may come about through self-selection or because firms with a larger pool of applicants can increase their hiring standards and obtain a more productive workforce. Workers with higher abilities are more likely to earn more wages, and companies are willing to pay higher wages to hire high-quality people as employees.

Self-selection (often referred to as adverse selection) comes about if the workers’ ability and reservation wages are positively correlated. The basic assumption of efficiency wage theory is that the efficiency of workers increases with the increase of wages. In this case, companies face a trade-off between hiring productive workers at higher salaries or less effective workers at lower wages. These notes derive the so-called Solow condition, which minimizes wages even if the cost of practical labor input is minimized. Solow condition means that in the labor market, the wage level paid by enterprises should equal the marginal product of workers, namely the market value of labor force. This condition is based on two basic assumptions: that firms operate in a competitive market and cannot control market wages and that individual workers are price takers rather than price setters. If there are two kinds of firms (low and high wage), then we effectively have two sets of lotteries (since firms cannot screen), the difference being that high-ability workers do not enter the low-wage lotteries as their reservation wage is too high. Thus low-wage firms attract only low-ability lottery entrants, while high-wage firms attract workers of all abilities (i.e. on average, they will select average workers). Therefore high-wage firms are paying an efficiency wage – they pay more and, on average, get more. However, the assumption that firms cannot measure effort and pay piece rates after workers are hired or to fire workers whose output is too low is quite strong. Firms may also be able to design self-selection or screening devices that induce workers to reveal their true characteristics.

High wages can effectively reduce personnel turnover, promote employees to work harder, prevent employees from resigning collectively, and effectively attract more high-quality employees. If firms can assess the productivity of applicants, they will try to select the best among the applicants. A higher wage offer will attract more applicants, particularly more highly qualified ones. This permits a firm to raise its hiring standard, thereby enhancing its productivity. Wage compression makes it profitable for firms to screen applicants under such circumstances, and selection wages may be necessary.

==Sociological models==

===Fairness, norms, and reciprocity===
Standard economic models (&quot;neoclassical economics&quot;) assume that people pursue only their self-interest and do not care about &quot;social&quot; goals (&quot;homo economicus&quot;). Neoclassical economics is divided into three theories, namely methodological individualism, methodological instrumentalist, and methodological equilibration. Some attention has been paid to the idea that people may be altruistic, but it is only with the addition of reciprocity and norms of fairness that the model becomes accurate. Thus of crucial importance is the idea of exchange: a person who is altruistic towards another expects the other to fulfil some fairness norm, be it reciprocating in kind, in some different but – according to some shared standard – equivalent way, or simply by being grateful. If the expected reciprocation is not forthcoming, the altruism will unlikely be repeated or continued. In addition, similar norms of fairness will typically lead people into negative forms of reciprocity, too – in retaliation for acts perceived as vindictive. This can bind actors into vicious loops where vindictive acts are met with further vindictive acts.

In practice, despite the neat logic of standard neoclassical models, these sociological models do impinge upon many economic relations, though in different ways and to different degrees. For example, suppose an employee has been exceptionally loyal. In that case, a manager may feel some obligation to treat that employee well, even when it is not in his (narrowly defined, economic) self-interest. It would appear that although broader, longer-term economic benefits may result (e.g. through reputation, or perhaps through simplified decision-making according to fairness norms), a significant factor must be that there are noneconomic benefits the manager receives, such as not having a guilty conscience (loss of self-esteem). For real-world, socialised, normal human beings (as opposed to abstracted factors of production), this is likely to be the case quite often. As a quantitative estimate of the importance of this, the total value of voluntary labor in the US – $74 billion annually – will suffice. Examples of the negative aspect of fairness include consumers &quot;boycotting&quot; firms they disapprove of by not buying products they otherwise would (and therefore settling for second-best); and employees sabotaging firms they feel hard done by.

Rabin (1993) offers three stylised facts as a starting point on how norms affect behaviour: (a) people are prepared to sacrifice their material well-being to help those who are being kind; (b) they are also prepared to do this to punish those being unkind; (c) both (a) and (b) have a greater effect on behaviour as the material cost of sacrificing (in relative rather than absolute terms) becomes smaller. Rabin supports his Fact A by Dawes and Thaler&#x27;s (1988) survey of the experimental literature, which concludes that for most one-shot public good decisions in which the individually optimal contribution is close to 0%, the contribution rate ranges from 40 to 60% of the socially optimal level. Fact B is demonstrated by the &quot;ultimatum game&quot; (e.g. Thaler 1988), where an amount of money is split between two people, one proposing a division, the other accepting or rejecting (where rejection means both get nothing). Rationally, the proposer should offer no more than a penny, and the decider accept any offer of at least a penny. Still, in practice, even in one-shot settings, proposers make fair proposals, and deciders are prepared to punish unfair offers by rejecting them. Fact C is tested and partially confirmed by Gerald Leventhal and David Anderson (1970), but is also reasonably intuitive. In the ultimatum game, a 90% split (regarded as unfair) is (intuitively) far more likely to be punished if the amount to be split is $1 than $1 million. 
A crucial point (as noted in Akerlof 1982) is that notions of fairness depend on the status quo and other reference points. Experiments (Fehr and Schmidt 2000) and surveys (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1986) indicate that people have clear notions of fairness based on particular reference points (disagreements can arise in the choice of reference point). Thus, for example, firms who raise prices or lower wages to take advantage of increased demand or increased labour supply are frequently perceived as acting unfairly, where the same changes are deemed acceptable when the firm makes them due to increased costs (Kahneman et al.). In other words, in people&#x27;s intuitive &quot;naïve accounting&quot; (Rabin 1993), a key role is played by the idea of entitlements embodied in reference points (although as Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger 2000 point out, there may be informational problems, e.g. for workers in determining what the firm&#x27;s profit is, given tax avoidance and stock-price considerations). In particular, it is perceived as unfair for actors to increase their share at the expense of others. However, over time such a change may become entrenched and form a new reference point which (typically) is no longer in itself deemed unfair.

===Sociological efficiency wage models===
Solow (1981) argued that wage rigidity may be partly due to social conventions and principles of appropriate behaviour, which are not entirely individualistic. Akerlof (1982) provided the first explicitly sociological model leading to the efficiency wage hypothesis. Using a variety of evidence from sociological studies, Akerlof argues that worker effort depends on the work norms of the relevant reference group. In Akerlof&#x27;s partial gift exchange model, the firm can raise group work norms and average effort by paying workers a gift of wages over the minimum required in return for effort above the minimum required. The sociological model can explain phenomena inexplicable on neoclassical terms, such as why firms do not fire workers who turn out to be less productive, why piece rates are so little used even where quite feasible; and why firms set work standards exceeded by most workers. A possible criticism is that workers do not necessarily view high wages as gifts, but as merely fair (particularly since typically 80% or more of workers consider themselves in the top quarter of productivity), in which case they will not reciprocate with high effort.

Akerlof and Yellen (1990), responding to these criticisms and building on work from psychology, sociology, and personnel management, introduce &quot;the fair wage-effort hypothesis&quot;, which states that workers form a notion of the fair wage, and if the actual wage is lower, withdraw effort in proportion, so that, depending on the wage-effort elasticity and the costs to the firm of shirking, the fair wage may form a key part of the wage bargain. This explains persistent evidence of consistent wage differentials across industries (e.g. Slichter 1950; Dickens and Katz 1986; Krueger and Summers 1988): if firms must pay high wages to some groups of workers – perhaps because they are in short supply or for other efficiency-wage reasons such as shirking – then demands for fairness will lead to a compression of the pay scale, and wages for different groups within the firm will be higher than in other industries or firms.

The union threat model is one of several explanations for industry wage differentials. This Keynesian economics model looks at the role of unions in wage determination. The degree in which union wages exceed non-union member wages is known as union wage premium. Some firms seek to prevent unionization in the first instances. Varying costs of union avoidance across sectors will lead some firms to offer supracompetitive wages as pay premiums to workers in exchange for their avoiding unionization. Under the union threat model (Dickens 1986), the ease with which industry can defeat a union drive has a negative relationship with its wage differential. In other words, wage variability should be low where the threat of unionization is low.

==Empirical literature==
Raff and Summers (1987) conduct a case study on Henry Ford’s introduction of the five dollar day in 1914. Their conclusion is that the Ford experience supports efficiency wage interpretations. Ford’s decision to increase wages so dramatically (doubling for most workers) is most plausibly portrayed as the consequence of efficiency wage considerations, with the structure being consistent, evidence of substantial queues for Ford jobs, and significant increases in productivity and profits at Ford. Concerns such as high turnover and poor worker morale appear to have played an important role in the five-dollar decision. Ford’s new wage put him in the position of rationing jobs, and increased wages did yield substantial productivity benefits and profits. There is also evidence that other firms emulated Ford’s policy to some extent, with wages in the automobile industry 40% higher than in the rest of manufacturing (Rae 1965, quoted in Raff and Summers). Given low monitoring costs and skill levels on the Ford production line, such benefits (and the decision itself) appear particularly significant.

Fehr, Kirchler, Weichbold and Gächter (1998) conduct labour market experiments to separate the effects of competition and social norms/customs/standards of fairness. They find that firms persistently try to enforce lower wages in complete contract markets. By contrast, wages are higher and more stable in gift exchange markets and bilateral gift exchanges. It appears that in complete contract situations, competitive equilibrium exerts a considerable drawing power, whilst in the gift exchange market it does not.

Fehr et al. stress that reciprocal effort choices are truly a one-shot phenomenon without reputation or other repeated-game effects. &quot;It is, therefore, tempting to interpret reciprocal effort behavior as a preference phenomenon.&quot;(p. 344). Two types of preferences can account for this behaviour: a) workers may feel obligated to share the additional income from higher wages at least partly with firms; b) workers may have reciprocal motives (reward good behaviour, punish bad). &quot;In the context of this interpretation, wage setting is inherently associated with signaling intentions, and workers condition their effort responses on the inferred intentions.&quot; (p. 344). Charness (1996), quoted in Fehr et al., finds that when signaling is removed (wages are set randomly or by the experimenter), workers exhibit a lower, but still positive, wage-effort relation, suggesting some gain-sharing motive and some reciprocity (where intentions can be signaled).

Fehr et al. state that &quot;Our preferred interpretation of firms’ wage-setting behavior is that firms voluntarily paid job rents to elicit non-minimum effort levels.&quot; Although excess supply of labour created enormous competition among workers, firms did not take advantage. In the long run, instead of being governed by competitive forces, firms’ wage offers were solely governed by reciprocity considerations because the payment of non-competitive wages generated higher profits. Thus, firms and workers can be better off relying on stable reciprocal interactions. That is to say, when the demands of enterprises and workers reach a balance point, it is stable and developing for both parties.

That reciprocal behavior generates efficiency gains has been confirmed by several other papers e.g. Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe (1995) – even under conditions of double anonymity and where actors know even the experimenter cannot observe individual behaviour, reciprocal interactions, and efficiency gains are frequent. Fehr, Gächter, and Kirchsteiger ([1996] 1997) show that reciprocal interactions generate substantial efficiency gains. However, the efficiency-enhancing role of reciprocity is generally associated with serious behavioural deviations from competitive equilibrium predictions. To counter a possible criticism of such theories, Fehr and Tougareva (1995) showed these reciprocal exchanges (efficiency-enhancing) are independent of the stakes involved (they compared outcomes with stakes worth a week&#x27;s income with stakes worth 3 months’ income and found no difference).

As one counter to over-enthusiasm for efficiency wage models, Leonard (1987) finds little support for shirking or turnover efficiency wage models, by testing their predictions for large and persistent wage differentials. The shirking version assumes a trade-off between self-supervision and external supervision, while the turnover version assumes turnover is costly to the firm. Variation in the cost of monitoring/shirking or turnover is hypothesized to account for wage variations across firms for homogeneous workers. But Leonard finds that wages for narrowly defined occupations within one sector of one state are widely dispersed, suggesting other factors may be at work. Efficiency wage models do not explain everything about wages. For example, involuntary unemployment and persistent wage rigidity are often problematic in many economies. But the efficiency wage model fails to account for these issues.

==Mathematical explanation==
Paul Krugman explains how the efficiency wage theory comes into play in real society. The productivity formula_1 of individual workers is a function of their wage formula_2, and the total productivity is the sum of individual productivity.
Accordingly, the sales formula_3 of the firm to which the workers belong becomes a function of both employment formula_4 and the individual productivity. The firm&#x27;s profit formula_5 is
:formula_6
Then we assume that the higher the wage of the workers become, the higher the individual productivity: formula_7.
If the employment is chosen so that the profit is maximised, it is constant. Under this optimised condition, we have
:formula_8
that is, 
:formula_9
Obviously, the gradient formula_10 of the slope is positive, because the higher individual 
productivity the higher sales. The formula_11 never goes to negative because of the optimised condition, and therefore we have
:formula_12
This means that if the firm increases their wage their profit becomes constant or even larger. Because after the employee&#x27;s salary increases, the employee will work harder, and will not easily quit or go to other companies. This increases the stability of the company and the motivation of employees. Thus the efficiency wage theory motivates the owners of the firm to raise the wage to increase the profit of the firm, and high wages can also be called a reward mechanism.

<text>A dilatant (, ) (also termed shear thickening) material is one in which viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain. Such a &quot;shear thickening fluid&quot;, also known by the initialism &quot;STF&quot;, is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid. This behaviour is usually not observed in pure materials, but can occur in suspensions.

A dilatant is a non-Newtonian fluid where the shear viscosity increases with applied shear stress. This behavior is only one type of deviation from Newton&#x27;s law of viscosity, and it is controlled by such factors as particle size, shape, and distribution. The properties of these suspensions depend on Hamaker theory and Van der Waals forces and can be stabilized electrostatically or sterically. Shear thickening behavior occurs when a colloidal suspension transitions from a stable state to a state of flocculation. A large portion of the properties of these systems are due to the surface chemistry of particles in dispersion, known as colloids.

This can readily be seen with a mixture of cornstarch and water (sometimes called oobleck), which acts in counterintuitive ways when struck or thrown against a surface. Sand that is completely soaked with water also behaves as a dilatant this is the reason why when walking on wet sand, a dry area appears directly underfoot.

Rheopecty is a similar property in which viscosity increases with cumulative stress or agitation over time. The opposite of a dilatant material is a pseudoplastic.

==Definitions==

There are two types of deviation from Newton&#x27;s law that are observed in real systems. The most common deviation is shear thinning behavior, where the viscosity of the system decreases as the shear rate is increased. The second deviation is shear thickening behavior where, as the shear rate is increased, the viscosity of the system also increases. This behavior is observed because the system crystallizes under stress and behaves more like a solid than a solution. Thus, the viscosity of a shear-thickening fluid is dependent on the shear rate. The presence of suspended particles often affects the viscosity of a solution. In fact, with the right particles, even a Newtonian fluid can exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. An example of this is cornstarch in water and is included in below.

The parameters that control shear thickening behavior are: particle size and particle size distribution, particle volume fraction, particle shape, particle-particle interaction, continuous phase viscosity, and the type, rate, and time of deformation. In addition to these parameters, all shear thickening fluids are stabilized suspensions and have a volume fraction of solid that is relatively high.

Viscosity of a solution as a function of shear rate is given by the power-law equation,
formula_1
where is the viscosity, is a material-based constant, and is the applied shear rate.

Dilatant behavior occurs when is greater than 1.

Below is a table of viscosity values for some common materials.

===Stabilized suspensions===

A suspension is composed of a fine, particulate phase dispersed throughout a differing, heterogeneous phase. Shear-thickening behavior is observed in systems with a solid, particulate phase dispersed within a liquid phase. These solutions are different from a Colloid in that they are unstable; the solid particles in dispersion are sufficiently large for sedimentation, causing them to eventually settle. Whereas the solids dispersed within a colloid are smaller and will not settle. There are multiple methods for stabilizing suspensions, including electrostatics and sterics.

In an unstable suspension, the dispersed, particulate phase will come out of solution in response to forces acting upon the particles, such as gravity or Hamaker attraction. The magnitude of the effect these forces have on pulling the particulate phase out of solution is proportional to the size of the particulates; for a large particulate, the gravitational forces are greater than the particle-particle interactions, whereas the opposite is true for small particulates. Shear thickening behavior is typically observed in suspensions of small, solid particulates, indicating that the particle-particle Hamaker attraction is the dominant force. Therefore, stabilizing a suspension is dependent upon introducing a counteractive repulsive force.

Hamaker theory describes the attraction between bodies, such as particulates. It was realized that the explanation of Van der Waals forces could be upscaled from explaining the interaction between two molecules with induced dipoles to macro-scale bodies by summing all the intermolecular forces between the bodies. Similar to Van der Waals forces, Hamaker theory describes the magnitude of the particle-particle interaction as inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Therefore, many stabilized suspensions incorporate a long-range repulsive force that is dominant over Hamaker attraction when the interacting bodies are at a sufficient distance, effectively preventing the bodies from approaching one another. However, at short distances, the Hamaker attraction dominates, causing the particulates to coagulate and fall out of solution. Two common long-range forces used in stabilizing suspensions are electrostatics and sterics.

====Electrostatically stabilized suspensions====

Suspensions of similarly charged particles dispersed in a liquid electrolyte are stabilized through an effect described by the Helmholtz double layer model. The model has two layers. The first layer is the charged surface of the particle, which creates an electrostatic field that affects the ions in the electrolyte. In response, the ions create a diffuse layer of equal and opposite charge, effectively rendering the surface charge neutral. However, the diffuse layer creates a potential surrounding the particle that differs from the bulk electrolyte.

The diffuse layer serves as the long-range force for stabilization of the particles. When particles near one another, the diffuse layer of one particle overlaps with that of the other particle, generating a repulsive force. The following equation provides the energy between two colloids as a result of the Hamaker interactions and electrostatic repulsion.

* , energy between a pair of colloids,
* , radius of colloids,
* , Hamaker constant between colloid and solvent,
* , distance between colloids,
* , surface ion concentration,
* , Boltzmann constant,
* , temperature in kelvins,
* formula_3 surface excess,
* formula_4 inverse Debye length.

====Sterically stabilized suspensions====

Different from electrostatics, sterically stabilized suspensions rely on the physical interaction of polymer chains attached to the surface of the particles to keep the suspension stabilized; the adsorbed polymer chains act as a spacer to keep the suspended particles separated at a sufficient distance to prevent the Hamaker attraction from dominating and pulling the particles out of suspension. The polymers are typically either grafted or adsorbed onto the surface of the particle. With grafted polymers, the backbone of the polymer chain is covalently bonded to the particle surface. Whereas an adsorbed polymer is a copolymer composed of lyophobic and lyophilic region, where the lyophobic region non-covalently adheres to the particle surface and the lyophilic region forms the steric boundary or spacer.

==Theories behind shear thickening behavior==

Dilatancy in a colloid, or its ability to order in the presence of shear forces, is dependent on the ratio of interparticle forces. As long as interparticle forces such as Van der Waals forces dominate, the suspended particles remain in ordered layers. However, once shear forces dominate, particles enter a state of flocculation and are no longer held in suspension; they begin to behave like a solid. When the shear forces are removed, the particles spread apart and once again form a stable suspension. 

Shear thickening behavior is highly dependent upon the volume fraction of solid particulate suspended within the liquid. The higher the volume fraction, the less shear required to initiate the shear thickening behavior. The shear rate at which the fluid transitions from a Newtonian flow to a shear thickening behavior is known as the critical shear rate.

===Order to disorder transition===
When shearing a concentrated stabilized solution at a relatively low shear rate, the repulsive particle-particle interactions keep the particles in an ordered, layered, equilibrium structure. However, at shear rates elevated above the critical shear rate, the shear forces pushing the particles together overcome the repulsive particle-particle interactions, forcing the particles out of their equilibrium positions. This leads to a disordered structure, causing an increase in viscosity.

The critical shear rate here is defined as the shear rate at which the shear forces pushing the particles together are equivalent to the repulsive particle interactions.

===Hydroclustering===

When the particles of a stabilized suspension transition from an immobile state to mobile state, small groupings of particles form hydroclusters, increasing the viscosity. These hydroclusters are composed of particles momentarily compressed together, forming an irregular, rod-like chain of particles akin to a logjam or traffic jam. In theory the particles have extremely small interparticle gaps, rendering this momentary, transient hydrocluster as incompressible. It is possible that additional hydroclusters will form through aggregation.

==Examples==

===Corn starch and water (oobleck)===
Cornstarch is a common thickening agent used in cooking. It is also a very good example of a shear-thickening system. When a force is applied to a 1:1.25 mixture of water and cornstarch, the mixture acts as a solid and resists the force.

===Silica and polyethylene glycol===
Silica nano-particles are dispersed in a solution of polyethylene glycol. The silica particles provide a high-strength material when flocculation occurs. This allows it to be used in applications such as liquid body armor and brake pads.

==Applications==

=== Traction control ===
Dilatant materials have certain industrial uses due to their shear-thickening behavior. For example, some all-wheel drive systems use a viscous coupling unit full of dilatant fluid to provide power transfer between front and rear wheels. On high-traction road surfacing, the relative motion between primary and secondary drive wheels is the same, so the shear is low and little power is transferred. When the primary drive wheels start to slip, the shear increases, causing the fluid to thicken. As the fluid thickens, the torque transferred to the secondary drive wheels increases proportionally, until the maximum amount of power possible in the fully thickened state is transferred. (See also limited-slip differential, some types of which operate on the same principle.) To the operator, this system is entirely passive, engaging all four wheels to drive when needed and dropping back to two wheel drive once the need has passed. This system is generally used for on-road vehicles rather than off-road vehicles, since the maximum viscosity of the dilatant fluid limits the amount of torque that can be passed across the coupling.

===Body armor===

Various corporate and government entities are researching the application of shear-thickening fluids for use as body armor. Such a system could allow the wearer flexibility for a normal range of movement, yet provide rigidity to resist piercing by bullets, stabbing knife blows, and similar attacks. The principle is similar to that of mail armor, though body armor using a dilatant would be much lighter. The dilatant fluid would disperse the force of a sudden blow over a wider area of the user&#x27;s body, reducing the blunt force trauma. However, the dilatant would not provide any additional protection against slow attacks, such as a slow but forceful stab, which would allow flow to occur.

In one study, standard Kevlar fabric was compared to a composite armor of Kevlar and a proprietary shear-thickening fluid. The results showed that the Kevlar/fluid combination performed better than the pure-Kevlar material, despite having less than one-third the Kevlar thickness.

Four examples of dilatant materials being used in personal protective equipment are Armourgel, D3O, ArtiLage (Artificial Cartilage foam) and &quot;Active Protection System&quot; manufactured by Dow Corning.

In 2002, researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and University of Delaware began researching the use of liquid armor, or a shear-thickening fluid in body armor. Researchers demonstrated that high-strength fabrics such as Kevlar can be made more bulletproof and stab-resistant when impregnated with the fluid. The goal of the “liquid armor” technology is to create a new material that is low-cost and lightweight while still offering equivalent or superior ballistic properties compared to current Kevlar fabric.

For their work on liquid armor, Dr. Eric Wetzel, an ARL mechanical engineer, and his team were awarded the 2002 Paul A. Siple Award, the Army’s highest award for scientific achievement, at the Army Science Conference.

The company D3O invented a non-Newtonian–based material that has seen wide adaptation across a broad range of standard and custom applications, including motorcycle and extreme-sports protective gear, industrial work wear, military applications, and impact protection for electronics. The materials allow flexibility during normal wear but become stiff and protective when strongly impacted. While some products are marketed directly, much of their manufacturing capability goes to selling and license the material to other companies for use in their own lines of protective products.

<doc id="817811" wikidata="Q53460" url="?curid=817811" title="Konrad I of Masovia">
<text>Konrad I of Masovia (ca. 1187/88 – 31 August 1247), from the Polish Piast dynasty, was the sixth Duke of Masovia and Kuyavia from 1194 until his death as well as High Duke of Poland from 1229 to 1232 and again from 1241 to 1243.

==Life==
Konrad was the youngest son of High Duke Casimir II the Just of Poland and Helen of Znojmo, daughter of the Přemyslid duke Conrad II of Znojmo (ruler of the Znojmo Appanage in southern Moravia, part of Duchy of Bohemia). His maternal grandmother was Maria of Serbia, apparently a daughter of the pre-Nemanjić &quot;župan&quot; Uroš I of Rascia.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1194, Konrad was brought up by his mother, who acted as regent of Masovia. In 1199, he received Masovia and in 1205 the adjacent lands of Kuyavia as well. In 1205, he and his brother, Duke Leszek I the White of Sandomierz, had their greatest military victory at Battle of Zawichost against Prince Roman the Great of Galicia–Volhynia. The Ruthenian army was crushed and Roman was killed in battle. The Rurik princess Agafia of Rus became his wife.

===Attempted conquests of Prussia===
In an effort to enlarge his dominions, Konrad unsuccessfully attempted to conquer the adjacent pagan lands of Chełmno in Prussia during a 1209 crusade with the consent of Pope Innocent III. In 1215, the monk Christian of Oliva was appointed a missionary bishop among the Old Prussians, his residence at Chełmno however was devastated by Prussian forces the next year. Several further campaigns in 1219, 1222 failed, instead Konrad picked a long-term border quarrel with the Prussian tribes.

The duke&#x27;s ongoing attempts on Prussia were answered by incursions across the borders of his Masovian lands, while Prussians were in the process of gaining back control over the disputed Chełmno Land and even threatened Konrad&#x27;s residence at Płock Castle. Subjected to constant Prussian raids and counter-raids, Konrad now wanted to stabilize the north of his Duchy of Masovia in this fight over the border area of Chełmno.

===Teutonic Order===
Thus in 1226, Konrad, having difficulty with constant raids over his territory, invited the religious military order of the Teutonic Knights to fight the Prussians, as they already had supported the Kingdom of Hungary against the Cuman people in the Transylavanian Burzenland from 1211 to 1225. When they notified Hungary that the Order was, firstly, responsible to the pope, the Knights were expelled by the Hungarian King Andrew II though. Thus, in turn for the Order&#x27;s service, Grand Master Herman of Salza wanted to have its rights documented beforehand, by a deal with Konrad that was to be confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor and the Roman Curia.

Emperor Frederick II issued in March 1226 the Golden Bull of Rimini, stating that:
:&quot;&quot;...our trusty Brother Herman, the worthy Master of the Sacred House of the Hospital of St. Mary of the Germans in Jerusalem &quot;[i.e., &quot;the Teutonic Order&quot;]&quot; has explained ... that our devoted Konrad &quot;(Chünradus)&quot;, Duke of Masovia and of Kuyavia &quot;(Cuiaviae)&quot;, has promised and undertaken to provide to him and to his brethren from that land, which is called the Chelmło Land &quot;(terra quae vocatur Culmen)&quot;, and in that other land, that is to say, between his borderland &quot;(marchiam)&quot; and the territories of the Prussians &quot;(confinia Prutenorum)&quot;, that they may thus indeed take up the task and readily embark upon the invasion and obtaining of the land of Prussia &quot;(terram Prusciae)&quot; for the honor and glory of the true God.&quot;

:&quot;&quot;We therefore... especially because the land itself is held under the sole rule of the Empire &quot;(sub monarchia imperii)&quot;, trusting also in the judgment &quot;(prudentia)&quot; of the same Master, because he is a man mighty both in deed and word and through his own and his brethren’s perseverance is mightily undertaking and manfully carrying out the conquest of that land... even though many, vainly besought with numerous exertions in this business, gave up &quot;(defecerunt)&quot; just when they seemed about to set forth, grant the land of Prussia to the same Master along with the forces of his order and with all those who think to invade [it]&quot;...&quot;

So far, the Knights were not convinced to take the trouble of fighting the Prussians. On the advice of the first Prussian bishop, Christian of Oliva, Konrad instead founded the Loyal Order of Dobrzyń in 1228. He then called for another Prussian Crusade, and was again defeated. In view of an imminent Prussian invasion, Konrad supposedly signed the Treaty of Kruszwica in 1230, according to which he granted Chełmno Land to the Teutonic Knights and the Order of Dobrzyń. By this donation disclaiming any enfeoffment, Konrad established the nucleus of the State of the Teutonic Order. However the document does not exist and it is believed that it was never signed and that the Order most likely forged it. The Knights under the command of Hermann Balk crossed the Vistula river and conquered Chełmno Land, erecting the castle of Toruń (&quot;Thorn&quot;) in 1231. In 1234, Pope Gregory IX issued the Golden Bull of Rieti, confirming the prior deals with the Teutonic Knights, stating that the land of the Order was only subject to the Pope, not a fief of anyone. In 1237, the Order&#x27;s lands were confiscated by Konrad and forced to invest the town of Dobryczin.

===High Duke===
Konrad was also entangled in the conflict over the Polish Seniorate Province with his Piast cousin Duke Władysław III Spindleshanks of Greater Poland and assumed the title of a Polish High Duke in 1229. However their Silesian relative Duke Henry I the Bearded finally prevailed as High Duke at Kraków in 1232 and confined Konrad&#x27;s rule again to Masovia. When Henry&#x27;s son and heir, High Duke Henry II the Pious was killed at the 1241 Battle of Legnica, Konrad once again assumed the senioral title, but had to yield to the claims raised by his nephew Bolesław V the Chaste, son of his elder brother Leszek, two years later.

==Marriage and children==

Around 1208/1209 Konrad married Agafia of Rus, daughter of Prince Svyatoslav III Igorevich. They had ten children:
#Bolesław I (c. 1210 – 17 April 1248), Duke of Masovia
#Casimir I (c. 1210/13 – 14 December 1267), Duke of Kuyavia
#Siemowit I (c. 1215 – 24 June 1262), succeeded eldest brother as Duke of Masovia.
#Eudoxia (b. c. 1215–1225), married Count Dietrich I of Brehna and Wettin
#Ludmila, probably a norbertine nun at Płock.
#Ziemomysł (c. 1220 – 10 July/18 September 1241).
#Salomea (c. 1220/1225 – aft. 30 August 1268?), probably a clare nun at Skała.
#Judith (c. 1222/27 – 4 December 1257/63), married firstly to Duke Mieszko II the Fat of Opole, secondly to Duke Henry III the White of Wrocław.
#Dubrawka (b. c. 1230, d. 1265).
#Mieszko (bef. 1236 – bef. 1238), died in infancy

==Konrad&#x27;s legacy==
Konrad is considered by Poles to be responsible for Teutonic Knights&#x27; control of most of the Baltic coastline, undermining Polish authority in the area. King Casimir III of Poland had to accept the rule of the Order in Thorn and Kulm by the 1343 Treaty of Kalisz. After the Thirteen Years&#x27; War in the 1466 Second Peace of Thorn, the Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon gained control over the Chełmno Land as part of Royal Prussia.

<text>The May Days (, ), sometimes also called May Events (, ), were a series of clashes between 3 and 8 May 1937 during which factions on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War engaged one another in street battles in various parts of Catalonia, centered on the city of Barcelona.

In those events, libertarian socialist supporters of the Spanish Revolution, such as the anarchist &quot;CNT&quot; and the anti-Stalinist POUM, which opposed a centralized government, faced others, such as the Republican government, Catalan government and the Communist Party of Spain, which believed in a strong central government.

The events were the culmination of the confrontation between prewar Republican legality and the Spanish Revolution, which had been in constant strife since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.

== Background ==

The Francoist military rebellion of July 1936 failed in Barcelona, and since then the city, as well as the rest of Catalonia, had been under the control of workers&#x27; militias, especially ones associated with the anarchist trade union &quot;Confederación Nacional del Trabajo&quot; (CNT-FAI) and the socialist trade union &quot;Unión General de Trabajadores&quot; (UGT). Just after taking the last rebelling barracks, the anarchist leaders met with the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya Lluis Companys. It resulted in the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia being established, the &quot;de facto&quot; government of Barcelona and Catalonia. It represented most parties from the &quot;Front d&#x27;Esquerres&quot; (the name of the Popular Front in Catalonia). The Generalitat and the central government had lost all freedom of action and assisted passively in the revolution that was taking place in Catalonia and extended to Aragon. The industries were collectivized, but there was always the same problem when the petitions of loans to the banks (collectivized but under control of communists and the government) were denied because those industries were not being supervised by the Generalitat. In October, the committee dissolved itself, and its members became councilors of the government of the Generalitat of Catalonia. However, the &quot;Patrullas de Control&quot; (&quot;Control Patrols&quot;, a revolutionary body that had a repressive character and in which CNT-FAI had a relative majority) continued their activities freely because of the inability of the Catalan government to control them.

The climate of distrust and confrontation was present not only among republican institutions and workers&#x27; organizations but also between those organizations, especially of anarchists toward socialists, communists and Catalan nationalists. Even among the communists, there was much division. The Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) followed the official doctrine of the Soviet Union and supported the separate handling of war and revolution and defending the Second Spanish Republic. The PCE was the major communist party in the country, but the PSUC was the main communist organization in Catalonia. At the other extreme, the anti-authoritarian Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) of former Right and Left Opposition radically opposed Joseph Stalin and supported carrying out the revolution while the war was raging; the anarchists agreed on that point with the POUM.

Tension was rising because a chain of events that took place during the winter that heated the political climate and paved the way for what would take place later. The PCE&#x27;s campaign against the POUM had begun in March during a political conference in Valencia. The POUM leaders were vilified and accused of being covert Nazi agents under a false revolutionary propaganda of being enemy agents infiltrated in the country. The POUM had come to propose an invitation for Leon Trotsky to reside in Catalonia, despite its differences with him. The POUM leaders were becoming increasingly wary during the spring of 1937. Tension in the streets of Barcelona was becoming evident of the arrival of a hot spring: the &quot;Patrullas de Control&quot; were led by José Asens and continued arbitrarily arresting and murdering in their infamous &quot;paseos&quot;. Other anarchist patrols practiced expropriations. Josep Tarradellas, as Companys&#x27; right hand, was determined to unify the security forces in Catalonia under one command and to finish with the &quot;Patrullas de Control&quot;. On 26 March, Tarradellas banned members of the police from having political affiliation and demanded for all political organizations to hand over their weapons. Thus, anarchists withdrew from the government of the Generalitat of Catalonia. The open crisis forced Companys to give in to their demands, anarchists retained their weapons, and the Control Patrols remained in place.

On 25 April, a force of &quot;Carabineros&quot; forced patrols of CNT in Puigcerdà to hand over control of the customs house. Juan Negrín, the Finance Minister, had resolved to end the anomaly under which the CNT controlled that important border. Puigcerdá had become a center of espionage, falsification of passports and clandestine leakage. Its mayor, Antonio Martin, insisted on general collectivization but raised his own livestock. After a violent confrontation occurred, he and several of his men were killed. Negrín then found it easier to gain control over the other customs posts.

The &quot;Guardia Nacional Republicana&quot; and the &quot;Guardia de Asalto&quot; (&quot;Assault Guards&quot;) were sent to Figueras and other cities in northern Catalonia to replace CNT patrols. In Barcelona, fear began of an outbreak of open warfare between the anarchists and the POUM against the government and the communists. Each side formed weapon caches and secretly fortified its buildings in for fear that its rivals would attack it first.

The tense calm continued for one week. May Day, traditionally a day of celebration, was spent in silence, as the UGT and the CNT agreed to suspend their parades, which inevitably would have caused riots.

== Opposing sides ==
Three main political forces were involved in the events that led to the May Days. Although all parties had winning the war as their main objective, the CNT, the Libertarian Youth, and the POUM and other minor groups like the anarchist Friends of Durruti Group or the Trotskyist Bolshevik-Leninist Section of Spain had a clear revolutionary motivation. The participation of these groups in the war, which was decisive in the opening events of the war, was motivated by the defense of the revolution and not the Republic. The Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) considered a revolutionary approach inappropriate without winning the war first.

There were also groups with other political affiliations that were inclined to return to the Republican legality, the authorities of the Republican Government in Valencia and the Generalitat. They forged an alliance with the aforementioned PSUC and the Republican Left of Catalonia. A third sector was composed by the &quot;possibilist&quot; sector of the CNT, supporting an immediate termination of hostilities between both sides. Although the PSUC was not a bourgeois party, from the point of view of the Republican authorities it presented itself as an alternative to the revolutionary chaos, and it advocated for the strengthening of central government that would replace the local committees. To get this done, they proposed a centrally organized and instructed army, led by a single command. Orwell summarized the PSUC-party line as follows:

On the position of the POUM, shared by most of the more radical anarchists, like the Friends of Durruti, Orwell states:

== Chronology ==

=== Preliminary events ===

On 2 May, the Minister of the Navy and Air Force, Indalecio Prieto, telephoned the Generalitat from Valencia. An anarcho-syndicalist telephonist on the other side replied that in Barcelona there was no government, only a Defense Committee. The government was convinced that anarchists were recording their telephone conversations since they, of course, had the means to do so. The same day, there was a call from President Manuel Azaña to Companys, President of the Generalitat. During the conversation, it was cut by the operator, who said that the lines should be used for more important purposes than a mere talk between presidents.

=== 3 May ===
A force of 200 police officers, commanded by the Minister of Public Order of the Government of Catalonia, Eusebio Rodríguez Salas, went to the Telefónica central exchange and presented itself at the censorship department located on the second floor, with the intention of taking control of the building. The anarchists saw that as a provocation since Telefónica was legally occupied by an anarcho-syndicalist committee, according to a decree on collectivization from the Generalitat itself. Rodríguez Salas, on his part, had authorization from the head of internal affairs of the regional government, Artemi Aiguader i Miró. The anarchist workers opened fire from the second-floor landing of the censorship department. Salas phoned in for help, with a company of the National Republican Guard arriving along with two Control Patrols heads, Dionisio Eroles (of the anarchist police station) and José Asens (of the Control Patrols). Eroles persuaded the CNT workers to cease fire; although they resisted at first, they surrendered their weapons, not before shooting through the windows to empty their ammunition.

A crowd gathered in Plaça Catalunya, and at first it was believed that the anarchists had captured the head of the police. The POUM, the Friends of Durruti Group, the Bolshevik-Leninists and the Libertarian Youth took positions, and after a few hours all of the political parties had taken out the weapons that they had hidden and began building barricades. From that skirmish, battles began in various parts of the city. Several hundred barricades were built and police units occupied roofs and church towers.

The PSUC and the government controlled the urban sectors on the east side of the Ramblas. Anarchists dominated the western sectors and all the suburbs. In the city centre, where the headquarters of trade unions and political parties (installed in requisitioned buildings and hotels) were relatively close, shooting began, and cars circulating were machine-gunned. In the Telefónica building a truce was agreed and telephone communications, which were essential for war operations, were not interrupted. The police, installed on the first floor, even sent bocadillos to the anarchists, who occupied the upper floors. However grenades thrown from the rooftops blew up several police cars. Early in the evening the leaders of the POUM proposed to the Barcelona anarchist leaders the formation of an alliance against the communists and the government. The anarchists refused immediately.

=== 4 May ===
On 4 May, Barcelona was a city plunged into silence, interrupted only by the fire of rifles and machine guns. Shops and buildings were covered by barricades. Anarchist armed groups attacked the barracks of the Assault Guards and government buildings. The government and communist militias returned fire. Fears started over a Civil War inside the Civil War. At eleven o&#x27;clock, the delegates of the CNT met and agreed to do everything possible to restore calm. Meanwhile, the anarchists Joan García Oliver and Federica Montseny launched an appeal on the radio to ask their followers to lay down their weapons and return to their jobs. Jacinto Toryho, the director of the CNT newspaper &quot;Solidaridad Obrera&quot;, expressed the same sentiment. Anarchist ministers arrived in Barcelona, and with them were Mariano Rodríguez Vázquez &quot;Marianet&quot; (secretary of the national committee of the CNT), Pascual Tomás and Carlos Hernández (from the executive committee of the UGT). None of them wanted a confrontation with the communists, and President Francisco Largo Caballero had no desire to use force against the anarchists. Federica Montseny later said that the news of the riots had caught her and the other anarchist ministers totally unprepared.

On the Aragon front, units of the 26th Anarchist Division (former Durruti Column) under the command of Gregorio Jover, gathered in Barbastro to march on Barcelona. However, upon hearing the García Oliver radio broadcast, they remained in their positions. Meanwhile, the 28th Division (former Ascaso Column) and the 29th Division of the POUM, commanded by Rovira, didn&#x27;t cancel their proposed march on Barcelona until the head of the Republican Air Force in the Aragon front, Alfonso Reyes, threatened to bomb them if they pressed on with their plan.

By five o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, several anarchists were killed by the police near the Via Durruti (current Via Laietana). The POUM began to support resistance publicly.

=== 5 May ===
Inside the Generalitat, Tarradellas, backed by Companys, still resisted the resignation of Artemi Ayguadé, which was demanded by the Anarchists. In the end, a solution was reached and Companys achieved a fragile truce between the different groups. To satisfy the anarchists&#x27; demands, the Catalan government would resign and form a new one without Ayguadé that would represent Anarchists, ERC, PSUC and Unió de Rabassaires. However, uncontrollable shootings still swept through the streets of Barcelona and caused the death of those who had ventured to leave their shelters. At 9:30 the Assault Guard attacked the seat of the doctors&#x27; trade union in Santa Ana Square, in central Barcelona, and the headquarters of the local FIJL. Anarchists denounced government complicity and Soviet interests in that attack on the social revolution in Catalonia. The Friends of Durruti Group published various leaflets demanding the release of Francisco Maroto del Ojo, an Andalusian anarchist who had recently been jailed, and asking people to resist. In one of them, it declared:

A Revolutionary Junta has been constituted in Barcelona. All the culprits of the coup d&#x27;etat, that operate under the protection of the government, will be executed. The POUM will be a member of the Junta because they support workers.

Nevertheless, both the CNT-FAI and the FIJL refused to take part in the initiative of that group. At about five o&#x27;clock, the anarchist authors Camillo Berneri and Francesco Barbieri were arrested by a group of twelve guards, six of them members of the local police and the rest from the PSUC. Both were murdered during their arrest. The climate of alarm worsened when British destroyers arrived at the port. The POUM feared that a bombardment would begin. In fact, the British feared that anarchists would take control of the situation, and talks occurred on evacuating foreign subjects from the city. At night, Federica Montseny, Minister of Health and an important member of the CNT, arrived with the purpose of mediating between all of the parties. The Communist Antonio Sesé, General Secretary of the Catalan UGT and a member of the Generalitat&#x27;s new provisional council, died in a gunfight on his way to receive his new appointment.

The same day, combat occurred in Tarragona and other coastal towns. There too, the Assault Guard proceeded to oust the CNT from the telephone exchanges they had occupied. Similar actions in Tortosa and Vic resulted in a final death toll of 30 anarchists in Tarragona and another 30 in Tortosa. At night, Lluis Companys and then Prime Minister Francisco Largo Caballero held a telephone conversation in which the Catalan President accepted the Spanish government&#x27;s offer of assistance for restoring order.

=== 6 May ===
At dawn, the CNT once again asked the workers to return to their work to no avail although more out of fear than out of obstinacy. In the afternoon, however, combat resumed. Various members of the National Republican Guard died in a cinema after a shelling from a 75 mm artillery cannon, carried from the coast by some members of the Libertarian Youth.

A force of about 5,000, most of them Assault Guards, departed from Madrid and Valencia towards Barcelona. Two Republican destroyers and the battleship Jaime I, coming from Valencia, reached the port of Barcelona that night. 

=== 7 May ===
At 8:20, the expedition of the Assault Guards reached Barcelona and occupied different points of the city. Some came by road from Valencia after they had suppressed the revolts in Tarragona and Reus. Local anarchists had bombed bridges, roads and railways to prevent the passage of the column. That day, the CNT called again for a return to work by proclaiming on the radio, &quot;Down the barricades! Each citizen takes its paving stone! Let&#x27;s return to normality!&quot; The expeditionary forces that entered Barcelona were under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Emilio Torres, who enjoyed certain sympathy from anarchists. His assignment was proposed by the CNT to promote the return to normality. Assault Guards in Barcelona, Tarragona and many other cities proceeded to disarm and arrest numerous members of the CNT, FAI, Libertarian Youth and POUM who had taken part in the riots.

=== 8 May ===
The streets returned to normality despite some isolated incidents, and the suppression of barricades began. The unrest in Barcelona had finally finished. The contemporary press estimated the death toll of 500 dead and 1,000 injured.

== Aftermath ==
The May Days had profound and long consequences. They showed that anarchists would not act with a single voice, unlike on 18 July 1936. A gap opened between the anarchist ministers, who were absorbed with winning the war, and the anarchist youth, who were above all obsessed by the triumph of the revolution. Also, very influential personalities like Escorza or García Oliver had lost control over their own followers. The crisis showed that there could be no truce between communists and the POUM. The Generalitat of Catalonia was restored to its old functions with the entry of one representative of the UGT (the communist Vidiella), one of the CNT (Valerio Mas) and one of ERC (again Tarradellas). Some of those responsible for the killings were tried later but only in Tarragona, and they were sentenced not to death but only to imprisonment.

The Generalitat of Catalonia, the communists and the central government seemed willing to act together against extremists by force, if necessary. The new Director of Public Order in Barcelona, José Echevarria Novoa, soon restored normality in much of the judicial system, but in that way, the communists could take more easily their crusade against the POUM. The republican authorities took no more measures against the CNT and the FAI because of their still-great power and their high level of popular support. The POUM situation was quite different, as the republican government soon outlawed the party, on 16 June, and arrested its main leaders, including Julián Gorkin and Andreu Nin. The POUM would disappear and the anarchists would never intervene in the war as before. Ultimately the internal disputes tore the republic apart and were a burden on its internal unity against the rebels.

Other consequences were the fall of the Government of the Victory, led by Largo Caballero, and the departure of the four anarchist ministers represented in it. It was also a clear victory of communist influence and power in the Spanish Republicans.

== In popular culture ==
The May Days were mentioned in Ted Allan&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;This Time a Better Earth&quot;.

Films that portray the May Days events of Barcelona include &quot;Memorias del general Escobar&quot; (&quot;Memories of General Escobar)&quot;, directed by José Luis Madrid and released in 1984, which tells the story of General Antonio Escobar Huertas and his role during the Spanish Civil War and the Barcelona Events, and the English film director Ken Loach&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Land and Freedom&quot;.

The Spanish Netflix drama &quot;Cable Girls&quot; (2017) also portrays a dramatization of events of the &quot;May Days&quot; but is set in Madrid instead of Barcelona.

<text>Non Regular Permanent Staff (NRPS; often pronounced as &quot;Nerps&quot;) were members of the British Territorial Army who were employed on a full-time basis. They usually filled vital unit administration or quartermaster roles and are most often long-service TA veterans or retired regulars. They held military rank and wore uniform when appropriate. On 1 April 2003, there were 1,100 NRPS personnel: 300 commissioned officers and 800 other ranks.

In 2010, the NRPS positions were discontinued in favour of TA Home Commitment positions.

<text>Blini (plural &quot;blinis&quot; or &quot;blini&quot;, rarely &quot;bliny&quot;; pl., Ukrainian: млинці pl., &quot;mlyntsi&quot;), singular: blin, are an Eastern European pancake made from various kinds of flour of buckwheat, wheat, etc. They may be served with smetana, cottage cheese, caviar and other garnishes, or simply smeared with butter. They are a traditional Slavic dish. 

In the West, blini traditionally refers to small savory pancakes made with leavened batter. In modern Russian, the term most often refers to pan-sized leavened thin pancakes, although smaller leavened pancakes are also called blini. Smaller and thicker pancakes (with several of them baked on one larger pan) are called &quot;oladyi&quot;.

Blintzes, called &quot;blinchiki&quot; (little blinis) in Russian are an offshoot of blini or crêpes. They are basically rolls based on thin pancakes usually made of wheat flour, folded to form a casing for various kinds of filing, typically cheese, fruit, or (in Russian cuisine) pre-fried minced meat, and then sautéed or baked.

==Etymology==

The Proto-Slavic term for the Russian pancakes was probably &quot;mlinŭ,&quot; which transformed in Old East Slavic into (), (cf. (), Ukrainian for &quot;blin&quot;). It is derived from the verb моло́ть, &quot;to mill&quot;, &quot;to grind&quot;. Max Vasmer in his &quot;Etymological Dictionary of Russian language&quot; notes that a similar word is used in many Slavic languages, as well as in Latvian and Lithuanian. While the Russian word (plural of &quot;&quot;) refers in modern Russian also to the introduced foreign pancakes in general; meanwhile the term (Russian pancakes) is often emphasized in Russia for differentiation.

Some English dictionaries record usage of the forms &quot;blin&quot; as singular and &quot;blini&quot; or &quot;bliny&quot; as plural, which corresponds to the original Russian forms, but other dictionaries consider this usage so rare in English that they do not mention &quot;blin&quot; at all and only record the widespread modern regular usage of &quot;blini&quot; for the singular and &quot;blinis&quot; for the plural. 

==History==
Blini were considered by early East Slavic people in pre-Christian times to be a symbol of the sun due to their round form. They were traditionally prepared at the end of winter to honor the rebirth of the new sun (Butter Week, or Maslenitsa, also called &quot;pancake week&quot;). The tradition of a dairy festival at that time of year was adopted by the Orthodox church as a way of using up dairy products before the start of Great Lent. This tradition is observed by Western Christians as Pancake Day. Drochena, a kind of blini, was also served at wakes to commemorate the recently deceased. Blini are considered to be the traditional meal in Lithuanian culture on Shrove Tuesday.

Traditional Russian blini are made with yeasted batter, which is left to rise and then diluted with milk, soured milk, and cold or boiling water. When diluted with boiling water, they are referred to as zavarniye bliny. A lighter and thinner form made from unyeasted batter (usually made of flour, eggs, milk, or soured milk, kefir, ryazhenka, varenets) is also common in Russia. Traditionally, blini are baked in a Russian oven. The process of preparing blini is still referred to as baking in Russian, even though they are nowadays pan-fried, like pancakes. All kinds of flour may be used, from wheat and buckwheat to oatmeal and millet, although wheat is currently the most popular.

==Varieties==
Some ways that blini are prepared and served include the following:

* Blini made from batter containing various additions such as grated potato or apple and raisins. Such blini are quite common in Eastern Europe and are more solidly filled than the spongy pancakes usually eaten in North America.
* Blini covered with butter, sour cream, varenie or jam, honey or caviar (whitefish, salmon or traditional sturgeon).

They may be folded or rolled into a tube with sweet or salty fillings such as varenye, fruit, berry, mashed potatoes, tvorog, cooked ground meat, cooked chicken, salmon, chopped boiled eggs with green onions or chopped mushrooms.

* Blini made by pouring batter over chopped vegetables, meat, or mushrooms put on a frying pan beforehand are called &quot;blini s pripyokom.&quot;
* Caviar is a popular filling for blini during Russian-style cocktail parties.
* Buckwheat blini are part of traditional Russian cuisine. They are also widespread in Ukraine, where they are sometimes known as (), and Lithuania&#x27;s Dzūkija region, the only region of the country in which buckwheat is grown, where they are called &quot;grikių blynai&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Aside from referring to pancakes, the word &quot;&quot; () is used in Russian as a &quot;minced oath&quot; for the Russian swear word &quot;блять&quot; , used as an interjection to express a negative emotion, akin to the words &quot;damn!&quot; or saying &quot;Holy Moly!&quot; while meaning &quot;Holy shit!&quot;.

There are many Russian proverbs involving &quot;blini&quot;. For example, &quot;Первый блин комом&quot; (&quot;The first &quot;blin&quot; is lumpy&quot;) is a figurative saying that the first attempt to do something is expected to be unsuccessful, said to calm down the person who failed the first try. An English equivalent would be &quot;You must spoil before you spin&quot;.

<text>View Askew Productions is an American film and television production company founded by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier in 1994. Actors Ben Affleck, Jeff Anderson, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Walter Flanagan, Bryan Johnson, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Brian O&#x27;Halloran and Ethan Suplee are people that frequently appear in projects under the View Askew banner.

==History==
Smith and Mosier founded the company in 1994 to produce their first film, &quot;Clerks&quot;, which was the first film in what is now known as the View Askewniverse. After the film became a success View Askew obtained a larger budget and produced &quot;Mallrats&quot; in 1995, which underperformed critically and commercially but found success after being released on home video. It was followed by 1997&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Dogma&quot;.

In 2000, View Askew briefly produced &quot;&quot;, a short-lived animated series based on &quot;Clerks&quot;, which only aired six episodes. They released &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, which starred Smith and Jason Mewes as their characters Jay and Silent Bob. It was followed by the first non-Askewniverse film, &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;, which featured many of Smith&#x27;s frequent cast members.

Two years after &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;, View Askew released &quot;Clerks II&quot;, the first true sequel to a previous Smith film, which features the main characters of the film &quot;Clerks&quot; continuing ten years later. This film was followed by the second non-Askewniverse film, &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;.

The company has released several of Smith&#x27;s non-fiction works, such as his four question and answer DVDs, &quot;An Evening With Kevin Smith&quot; in 2002, &quot;An Evening With Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder&quot; in 2006, &quot;Sold Out: A Threevening with Kevin Smith&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Kevin Smith: Too Fat for 40&quot; in 2011. It has produced &quot;Sucks Less with Kevin Smith&quot;, a show which features (at least) three UCLA students who are enrolled in a class about cinematography in which Smith is their teacher.
In addition to the various Smith-directed films, the company has produced movies for other directors including Malcolm Ingram&#x27;s &quot;Drawing Flies&quot; and &quot;Small Town Gay Bar&quot;, Bryan Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Vulgar&quot;, Vincent Pereira&#x27;s &quot;A Better Place&quot;, and Brian Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Big Helium Dog&quot;.

The company&#x27;s logo was originally a smiling clown with a 5 o&#x27; clock shadow dressed in women&#x27;s lingerie and platform pumps, named &quot;Vulgar&quot; which gained controversy due to its content and was later changed to a cartoon Jay and Silent Bob with film equipment. In 2022, with the release of &quot;Clerks III&quot;, the logo changed again, this time to Vulgar&#x27;s face.
