<text>Bailter Space (a.k.a. Bailterspace) is a New Zealand shoegaze and noise rock band that formed in Christchurch, in 1987 as Nelsh Bailter Space; they had previously recorded as The Gordons. Its members are Alister Parker (guitar, bass), John Halvorsen (bass, guitar), and Brent McLachlan (drums/percussion, samples). After releasing seven studio albums, numerous EPs/singles and a career retrospective compilation, Bailter Space went on an extended hiatus in 2004. They returned in August 2008 to play the Bowery Ballroom in Manhattan.

==History==
Halvorsen, Parker, and McLachlan were in a band called The Gordons formed by John Halvorsen in 1980. The Gordons released the three-song &quot;Future Shock&quot; EP in 1981, along with a video for the song &quot;Adults and Children&quot;. Their debut self-titled LP The Gordons came out later that year. The band then released the &quot;Volume 2 LP&quot; in 1984, with Vince Pinker on bass in the absence of Alister, before disbanding circa 1985. Flying Nun Europe (and subsequently Flying Nun proper) reissued &quot;The Gordons&quot; and &quot;Future Shock&quot; on one CD, while &quot;Volume 2&quot; remains unavailable.

Nelsh Bailter Space was formed by Parker and former Clean drummer Hamish Kilgour in 1987, initially completing the line-up with Glenda Bills on keyboards and Ross Humphries (also of The Terminals, and formerly of The Pin Group), later shortening its name to Bailter Space. After a couple of singles, Bills and Humphries left, with Halvorsen joining on bass, this line-up recording the &quot;Tanker&quot; album and the &quot;Grader Spader&quot; single, both produced by Brent McLachlan. The band travelled to the United States where they played at the New Music Seminar in 1988, and when they returned, Kilgour opted to stay there with his new wife and form a new band, The Mad Scene. Parker and Halvorsen recruited McLachlan as the new drummer, recreating the original Gordons lineup. This line-up debuted with the &quot;Thermos&quot; album, recorded in 1989.

After several releases on Flying Nun, and after changing base several times between New Zealand, Germany, and the US, New York City indie label Matador Records signed them for release in the United States, in approximately 1990. The 1992 EP &quot;The Aim&quot; was the band&#x27;s first official U.S. release, and was released as two separate 7-inch singles in the UK, with both awarded &quot;Single of the Week&quot; by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. The band moved to New York City during the 1993 &quot;Robot World&quot; sessions. The &quot;EIP&quot; EP was released, containing slightly-remixed versions of two &quot;Robot World&quot; tracks and two that would appear on the forthcoming &quot;Vortura&quot;. &quot;Vortura&quot; would be followed a year later by &quot;Wammo&quot;. In 1999 the band performed in Toronto as part of the Neon Palm Festival.

After this, their U.S. releases came out on NYC-based label Turnbuckle Records, which folded circa 2002. In 2004, Matador Records deleted all Bailter Space releases from their catalog. The band&#x27;s releases are now out of print, except for in New Zealand / Australia.

A career-spanning retrospective compilation, &quot;Bailterspace&quot; was issued in 2004.

In August 2008, Bailter Space emerged from a 4-year hiatus to perform live at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City. They were joined by new recruit Ian Ljungquist filling in on the bass.

A new album entitled &quot;Strobosphere&quot; was released in New Zealand on 13 August 2012 and in the United States on 21 August 2012.

==Musical style==
The band have often been compared to Sonic Youth, and they were once described as &quot;The Sonic Youth of the Southern Hemisphere&quot;, with &quot;Trouser Press&quot; describing their early sound as &quot;hard, droning, unforgiving guitar music with occasional lapses into verse/chorus regularity&quot;. By &quot;Tanker&quot; their sound had become more conventional. With their relocation to New York, their sound also shifted, with the band&#x27;s next releases described as &quot;an unholy collision between The Beatles harmonies and The Velvet Underground dissonance&quot;, with Parker stating at the time that the band were getting into &quot;the harmonic value of distortion; we started to be very particular about where we set the instruments up and the angles the sounds were bouncing at. From these harmonic experiments I became more interested in the actual melodic content of the music&quot;. Pitchfork Media described them in 1999 as &quot;a huge mess of sound that&#x27;s simultaneously beautiful, jagged, atonal, and supremely melodic&quot;, while another review in the same year described their sound as &quot;one part Superchunk, one part Pixies, and one part Dinosaur Jr.&quot;

<text>The Call Aircraft Company (CAC or CallAir) was established by Reuel Call in 1939 at Afton, Wyoming, to build a touring aircraft of his own design.
==History==
The Call Aircraft Company hoped to advance the development of its CallAir Model A to the point of starting production in 1940, but the start of World War II delayed their plans, with the factory operating as an aircraft repair facility for the duration of the conflict. The company was able to continue doing research and development on the Model A, earning a type certificate in July 1944, with the future production model was designated the Model A-2.

CallAir started production of the Model A-2 in late 1945, but first it had to obtain the raw materials. That same year it purchased the inventory of materials from Interstate Aircraft and Engineering as supplies of steel tubing, engines, instruments, fittings, etc had been diverted to those companies with government contracts during the war. Rights to both models of the Interstate Cadet (the S-1A and S-1B) were first transferred to the Harlow Aircraft Company in what Joseph Juptner described in his U.S. Civil Aircraft, Vol 8, as a &quot;deal of some kind&quot; in 1945 and then to CallAir for a reported $5,000 in 1950 ($ in ). CallAir built two S-1A Cadets: The first, built in 1951 with the ambitious serial number of 1001, was badged as an Interstate, likely due to the preponderance of built-up Interstate components used in construction; the second was badged a CallAir, serial number 1002, the only Cadet built with their name on it, in 1952. 

Production of the Model A commenced after the war with variations developed over time. Sales of the Model A grew with the A-4, which was adapted in 1954 into what Carl Petersen described as the world&#x27;s first purpose-built agricultural aircraft. This was pure advertising hype as the first purpose built agricultural aircraft was the Huff-Daland Duster designed in 1923-1924, some of which were built for Delta Dusters, later Delta Air Lines The CallAir A-4 evolved into the A-5, the best seller (83 built, including the A-5 Texan) of the Model A-series. 

CallAir found itself struggling against fierce competition from Cessna, Piper, and the masses of war-surplus aircraft flooding the market. After 20 years of ownership, founder Reuel Call sold the company in 1959, and the company foundered by the end of the year.

In 1962 the company&#x27;s assets were purchased by the Intermountain Manufacturing Company (IMCO), headed by Barlow Call, Sr. and Carl Petersen. IMCO, less the Cadet type certificates, was later purchased by Aero Commander in December 1966. However, in 1968 Polaris leased the former factory buildings to build snowmobiles. Following the death of Barlow Call in a mid-air collision while herding horses, the Cadet type certificates were sold separately by the Barlow Call estate to William Diehl as Nikiski Marine Corporation of Anchorage, Alaska in 1969 and Arctic Aircraft Company, Inc in 1970.

==Museum==
The CallAir Foundation maintains a museum of the company in its hometown.

<doc id="825826" wikidata="Q325312" url="?curid=825826" title="Joe Sewell">
<text>Joseph Wheeler Sewell (October 9, 1898 – March 6, 1990) was an American professional baseball infielder who played in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees from 1920 to 1933. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977.

Sewell was a member of two World Series-winning teams. He holds the record for the lowest strikeout rate in major league history, striking out on average only once every 73 plate appearances, and the most consecutive games without a strikeout, at 115.

==Early life==
Joseph Wheeler Sewell was born on October 9, 1898, in Titus, Alabama.

Sewell attended Wetumpka High School in Wetumpka, Alabama. He lettered in college football at the University of Alabama in 1917, 1918, and 1919. He led the school baseball team to four conference titles.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Sewell joined the minor league New Orleans Pelicans in 1920, where he played a partial season before being called up to the &quot;big league&quot;.

===Cleveland Indians (1920–1930)===
Sewell made his Major League debut mid-season in 1920 with the World Series champion Cleveland Indians shortly after shortstop Ray Chapman was killed by a pitch from the Yankees’ Carl Mays in August and became the team&#x27;s full-time shortstop the following year. An emerging star, Sewell batted .318 with 101 runs, 93 RBIs and a .412 on-base percentage in 1921.

Sewell&#x27;s patience and daily work ethic became his hallmarks over the following decade and a half. Playing with Cleveland until 1930 and the New York Yankees from 1931 to 1933, Sewell batted .312 with 1,141 runs, 1,054 RBI, 436 doubles, 68 triples, 49 home runs, 842 bases on balls and a .391 on-base percentage. He regularly scored 90 or more runs a season and twice topped the 100 RBI plateau in 1923 and &#x27;24. He hit a career-high 11 home runs in 1932.

Sewell struck out 114 times in 7,132 career at-bats for an average of one strikeout every 62.5 at-bats, second only to Willie Keeler (63.1). He also holds the modern single-season record for fewest strikeouts over a full season, with 3, set in 1932. Sewell also had 3 strikeouts in 1930, albeit in just 353 at-bats (as opposed to 503 in his record-setting year), as well as three other full seasons (1925, 1929, 1933) with 4 strikeouts. He struck out ten or more times in only four seasons, and his highest strikeout total was 20, during the 1922 season. For his 1925–1933 seasons, Sewell struck out 4, 6, 7, 9, 4, 3, 8, 3, and 4 times. He also holds the record for consecutive games without recording a strikeout, at 115.

Sewell also played in 1,103 consecutive games, which to that point was second only to Everett Scott.

===New York Yankees (1931–1933)===
 His 167.7 at-bats per strikeout in 1932 is still a single-season record.

According to his obituary published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he played his entire Major League career using only one bat (a 40-ouncer he dubbed &quot;Black Betsy.&quot;), which he kept in shape by rubbing with a Coke bottle and seasoning with chewing tobacco.

Sewell played in two World Series, in 1920 and 1932, winning both times. His 1977 induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame was by the Veterans Committee. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. (He joined the Indians&#x27; roster after September 1 in 1920 and normally would not have been eligible to participate in post-season play, but Wilbert Robinson, manager of the Brooklyn Robins, waived the rule because of the circumstances with Chapman.)

==Personal life==

Two of his brothers, Luke and Tommy, also played major league baseball. Tommy played in one game with the Chicago Cubs in 1927, and Luke played for four teams over 20 years and, as manager of the St. Louis Browns, led the team to its only pennant in 1944. His cousin Rip Sewell was a major league pitcher credited with inventing the eephus pitch.

Joe Sewell was a member of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Sewell-Thomas Stadium, the baseball stadium at the University of Alabama, is named in his honor and is nicknamed by Crimson Tide fans as &quot;The Joe&quot;. After his retirement, Sewell worked as a public relations man for a dairy and was a major league scout.

In 1964, at the age of 66, he became the Alabama baseball coach, achieving a 114–99 record in seven seasons.

One of his pitchers was future NFL standout, Alabama quarterback and 1966 MLB 10th round draftee (Yankees) Ken &quot;The Snake&quot; Stabler.

==Death==
Sewell died on March 6, 1990, aged 91, in Mobile, Alabama. He was the last surviving member of the 1920 World Champion Cleveland Indians.

Posthumously, Sewell&#x27;s community (Elmore County) has established a scholarship award recognizing local high school seniors who exhibit Christian character, leadership in their community, strong academic standing, and athletic achievements. Sewell graduated from Wetumpka High School in 1916.

<text>Bessbrook (Irish: &quot;An Sruthán&quot;) is a village in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. It lies about three miles (5 km) northwest of Newry and near the Newry bypass on the main A1 Belfast-Dublin road and Belfast-Dublin railway line. Today the village of Bessbrook straddles the three townlands of Maghernahely, Clogharevan and Maytown. Bessbrook is near Newry railway station. It had a population of 2,892 at the 2021 Census. The model village of Bessbrook, County Armagh is a visible memorial to the commercial endeavours of the Richardson family over a number of generations.

During the late 20th century some of the worst violence of &quot;the Troubles&quot; took place near the village and it became a military zone with a large garrison. The small village became the busiest (military) heliport in Europe.

== History ==
Bessbrook is named from Elizabeth or Bess Nicholson, wife of Joseph Nicholson whose family had carried on a linen business in the district from 1806 until 1845. The &#x27;brook&#x27; is a stream which runs through the outskirts of the village.

Bessbrook was founded by John Grubb Richardson in 1845 as a &#x27;model village&#x27; along with the Richardson Spinning industry, with spacious streets and squares surrounding a large linen mill owned by the Quaker Richardson family. In the 18th and 19th centuries the linen industry was a significant contributor to the wealth of Quaker families in Ulster. As a social experiment it is similar to the model of the better-known Bournville company town founded by the Cadbury family near Birmingham, England. The model village of Bessbrook, provided a model for George Cadburys “Bournville”, the famous model village in England and predates this development by more than 30 years. The founder of Bessbrook, John G. Richardson, was a Quaker and was likely aware of other quakers such as the Malcomson Family who set up Portlaw in County Waterford. This awareness had some influence on Richardson’s own schemes in Bessbrook.

Among the principles on which the village was based was a philosophy of &quot;Three P&#x27;s&quot;: there should be no public houses, no pawn shops, and consequently no need for police. It was John Grubb Richardson&#x27;s belief that without a public house there would be no need for a pawn brokers or police station. To this day there are no public houses in the village. Nor are there any pawn shops, although there was a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) station until its closure in June 2012. Richardson did not at first have any confirmed ideas about the benefits of abstinence from alcohol but in the first years following setting up Bessbrook he saw the damage alcohol was doing to his employees and his business. Most of the Bessbrook population supported this policy and in the 1870’s when a poll was taken the majority of the town confirmed their wish that the town would remain free of public houses and alcohol. In 1885 the hydro-electrically powered Bessbrook and Newry Tramway opened.

=== Infrastructure in the model village ===
At one time, Bessbrook linen was among the finest in the world, and the linen mill provided most of the employment in the village. Tenement houses were constructed for the mill workers, many of which were of such good quality that they are still inhabited today. Each house also had an allotment garden for the growing of vegetables, and the area of the village where they were situated is still known as &#x27;The Gardens&#x27;, although the allotments themselves have been replaced by further housing. Most of the buildings in the village are constructed of granite, which is abundant locally.

In the frequently segregated communities of Northern Ireland, Bessbrook is an unusually mixed village, with representation of Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic denominations. The Richardsons sometimes faced criticism that they did not employ enough Roman Catholics, however half of the employees of the linen company were Catholic. John G. Richardson facilitated the worship of Roman Catholic, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, and other communities by providing ground for their place of worship and also showed great attention to detail in insuring that the provided schooling was free of sectarianism. The village also has a Quaker meeting house. This is set in the demesne of The Woodhouse, which was inhabited by the Richardson family until the 1980s, and of Derrymore House – also a Richardson property until it was bequeathed to the National Trust; it was once the home of Isaac Corry MP. The area has been designated a historic park.

By the mid-1840s, when Bessbrook was set up as a model village it was not uncommon for Ulster workers to have housing built for them by factory owners, and Bessbrook was no different. John G. Richardson built housing for his workers and had a policy to bring poor people in, these people were often beggars and unqualified people, to work for him as he felt it would encourage these employees to improve themselves and raise themselves up to a higher standard. Each house had three to five rooms. There was a school in Bessbrook, the pupils of which seemed to be clean, intelligent and eager to learn. This school was funded by the parents who gave one penny to send their child there and by Bessbrook Spinning Co. who gave £100 to supplement government funding. There was a dispensary in the town and the workers subscribed to a medical club which was supplemented by donations from Bessbrook Spinning Co. which supported a doctor. There was a Temperance Hotel which acted as a social centre where English and Irish Newspapers could be bought, draughts and chess could be played, and people could indulge in smoking. The town boasted a Co-Operative store, a refreshment hall for travelling workers, a farm supplying milk, as well as allotments.

Following James N. Richardson III taking over from his father, John G. Richardson, withdrawing from management of the business, John G. Richardson busied himself with other projects which promoted schemes that would improve the life of the People in Bessbrook. These projects included the town hall, which provided a library and a room which facilitated lectures and meetings. These projects were largely funded from John G. Richardson’s personal wealth.

===The Troubles===
Bessbrook saw much of the worst violence in the Troubles. The linen mill was converted by the British Army into a major military base. A helicopter landing area was established to supply other military outposts in the area since road-borne movements of troops and supplies were vulnerable to landmine attack. At one stage the little village was reportedly the busiest helicopter airport in Europe.

Nine of the ten Protestants murdered by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in the Kingsmill massacre were from Bessbrook.

The end of the Troubles, following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, has led to some recovery for the village. Traffic restrictions have been relaxed and the visible security presence has been reduced. On 25 June 2007 the British Army withdrew their military presence from Bessbrook and closed all of their facilities, marking an end to Operation Banner in the South Armagh region. It was confirmed that the local police station would be disposed of by 2009, one of 26 stations that the Police Service of Northern Ireland announced would be closing due to cost efficiency measures. It later closed permanently in 2012 and the site was put up for sale in 2013.

== Places of interest ==
On the outskirts of the village is John Macneill&#x27;s Craigmore Viaduct, known locally as the Eighteen Arches, built in 1851. The viaduct still carries the Dublin-Belfast railway line and with eighteen, (60 ft) twenty metre high arches, spanning about quarter of a mile (500 m), it was for a long time the longest bridge in Ireland. It is constructed from local granite.

Derrymore House, a National Trust property open to the public, is nearby. It is an 18th-century thatched house set in over of parkland and woodland. The Act of Union was drafted in the drawing room of the house in 1800.

<doc id="825828" wikidata="Q388408" url="?curid=825828" title="Endless Love (1981 film)">
<text>Endless Love is a 1981 American romantic drama film directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and starring Brooke Shields, Martin Hewitt, Shirley Knight, Don Murray, Richard Kiley, Penelope Milford and Beatrice Straight. It also marked Tom Cruise&#x27;s film debut.

Based on the 1979 Scott Spencer novel of the same name, the screenplay was written by Judith Rascoe. The original music score was composed by Jonathan Tunick. Although the novel is set in the summer of 1969, the movie transports the action to the early 1980s. The film also discards the non-chronological structure of the novel and tells all the events in chronological sequence.

Critics compared the film unfavorably to the novel, which showcased the dangers of obsessive love. Despite the poor reviews, its eponymous theme song, performed by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, became a #1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song spent nine weeks at #1 and received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for &quot;Best Original Song&quot;, along with five Grammy Award nominations.

==Plot==
In suburban Chicago, 15-year-old Jade Butterfield and 17-year-old David Axelrod fall in love after being introduced by Jade&#x27;s older brother, Keith. The Butterfields&#x27; bohemian lifestyle, for which they&#x27;re well known in their community, allows Jade and David to develop an all-consuming and passionate relationship, including allowing them to have sex in Jade&#x27;s room. Where her family is open, David&#x27;s home life is dull; his parents are wealthy political activists who have little interest in his life.

One night, Jade&#x27;s mother, Ann, sneaks downstairs, catching Jade and David making love by the fireplace. She starts living vicariously through them, but her husband, Hugh, watches them with increasing unease. Jade&#x27;s nightly trysts begin to negatively impact her grades and her ability to sleep. One morning, she tries to steal a prescription sleeping pill from her father, but he catches her. As a last straw, Hugh demands that David stop seeing Jade until the end of the school year. David is devastated, believing that Hugh wants to destroy their relationship, but Ann calmly assures him that the time apart is for the best and will go by quickly.

Back at school, one of David&#x27;s friends, Billy, tells him that when he was eight, he tried to burn a pile of newspapers, got scared and put the fire out, and his parents thought he was a hero for saving the house from burning. Inspired by this grim story, David starts a fire on the Butterfields&#x27; front porch after their late-night party and walks away. Unfortunately, by the time he returns, the flame has spread too far under the high wind. David immediately evacuates the Butterfields from the burning house before he is subsequently apprehended.

Following the trial, David is convicted of second-degree arson, sentenced to five years&#x27; probation, committed into a mental hospital for evaluation and forbidden to go anywhere near Jade or her family again. He continues to write her daily, but the letters are not sent because of the no-contact order. His parents arrange to have him released early from the mental hospital, much to Hugh&#x27;s chagrin. Meanwhile, David receives his many letters upon his exit, and after realizing why Jade never wrote back, he decides to pursue her, although he knows it is a violation of his parole.

After the loss of their home, the Butterfields have moved from Chicago to Manhattan, where Ann and Hugh file for divorce. David unexpectedly visits Ann at her apartment. At dinner, she intimates she has an attraction to David, but he gently refuses her advances. When she is not looking, he thumbs through her address book, finding out where Jade is and discovers that she now attends the University of Vermont in Burlington. Intent on catching a bus to Vermont, David encounters Hugh on the street. Enraged, Hugh starts chasing him and is hit by a car and killed. Hugh&#x27;s fiancée, Ingrid, arrives on the scene just in time to see David leaving. He comes close to boarding the bus to Vermont but is overcome with grief and returns to Ann&#x27;s apartment and consoles her. Keith orders David to leave and tells him that Jade hates him whilst Ingrid, catching a glimpse of David, recognizes him from the accident.

Later, Jade goes to David&#x27;s hotel room and tells him that they have to leave their relationship in the past and move on with their lives separately. He pulls her back as she tries to leave, throwing her on the bed and holding her down until she admits she still loves him and they stay the night together. The next morning, Jade and David plan to return to Chicago and begin a new life together. Keith and Ingrid arrive at David’s hotel and tell Jade that David is at fault for their father&#x27;s death. She refuses to believe it at first, but when Ingrid confirms that David was actually at the scene she becomes horrified. David tries to explain, but Keith attacks him, and the two get in a struggle. The police arrive and arrest David for brawling, disturbing the peace and violating his parole.

David is sentenced to five years in a state prison and despairs that he may never see Jade again. At a lakeside, Jade informs her mother that nobody will ever love her as David does, and Ann expresses her understanding and approval. From prison, through his barred cell window, David sees Jade approach the prison to visit him.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Endless Love&quot; is based on Scott Spencer&#x27;s 1979 novel of the same name. The film is directed by Franco Zeffirelli and written by Judith Rascoe. The film stars Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt in the two leading roles. It is also the film debut of Hewitt, Tom Cruise, Jami Gertz, Jeff Marcus and Ian Ziering. Principal photography began on September 22, 1980 on location in Chicago, New York City and Long Island and on set at Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. Production was finished on December 19, 1980.

The MPAA awarded the initial cut of &quot;Endless Love&quot; an X rating. Director Franco Zeffirelli subsequently made several cuts in the love scenes between Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt to achieve a lower rating. The film was re-submitted to the MPAA five times before they awarded it an R rating.

==Release==
===Box office===

The film premiere for &quot;Endless Love&quot; took place on July 16, 1981, at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City. The film was released the next day. Despite the poor critical reception, the film was a box office success. It made $4,163,623 on its opening weekend and went on to gross $31,184,024 in total, becoming the twenty-second highest earning film domestically in 1981. Internationally, the film took in a further $1,308,650 bringing its total worldwide gross to $32,492,674.

===Reception===

The film received mostly negative reviews upon its release. Roger Ebert compared the film unfavorably with the novel, describing Martin Hewitt as miscast and criticizing the narrative, although he did praise Brooke Shields&#x27; performance:Is there anything good in the movie? Yes. Brooke Shields is good. She is a great natural beauty, and she demonstrates, in a scene of tenderness and concern for Hewitt and in a scene of rage with her father, that she has a strong, unaffected screen acting manner. But the movie as a whole does not understand the particular strengths of the novel that inspired it, does not convince us it understands adolescent love, does not seem to know its characters very well, and is a narrative and logical mess.
Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:There are two sorts of people who&#x27;ll be going to see &quot;Endless Love&quot; — those who have read the richly imaginative novel on which the movie is based and those who have not. There will be dismay in the first camp, but it may be nothing beside the bewilderment in the second.&quot;

Film historian Leonard Maltin seemed to agree, calling the film a &quot;textbook example of how to do everything wrong in a literary adaptation.&quot;

In 2014, Scott Spencer, the author of the novel on which the film was based, wrote, &quot;I was frankly surprised that something so tepid and conventional could have been fashioned from my slightly unhinged novel about the glorious destructive violence of erotic obsession&quot;. Spencer described the film as a &quot;botched&quot; job and wrote that Franco Zeffirelli &quot;egregiously and ridiculously misunderstood&quot; the novel.

As of November 2021, &quot;Endless Love&quot; holds a rating of 26% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews.

===Awards and nominations===

<text>The Intermountain Manufacturing Company (IMCO) was a US aircraft manufacturer of the 1960s based in Afton, Wyoming that produced agricultural aircraft.

IMCO was formed in 1962 to purchase the assets of the failed Call Aircraft Company, and the following year commenced new production of the CallAir A-9. IMCO also developed an enlarged and refined version of the aircraft, designated the B-1.

Aero Commander, a division of Rockwell International purchased IMCO in 1966 and relocated production to Albany, Georgia the following year.

<text>Aero Commander was an aircraft manufacturer formed in 1944. In subsequent years, it became a subsidiary of Rockwell International and Gulfstream Aerospace. The company ceased aircraft production in 1986.

==History==
Aero was formed in Culver City, California, in 1944 to design and manufacture a light twin-engined transport aircraft. Ted Smith, a former project engineer at Douglas Aircraft Company, assembled a team of 14 engineers to design what would be the Aero Commander. Preliminary design was completed in 1946. The first prototype took flight on April 23, 1948, and was certified by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) in June, 1950. Three men funded the company&#x27;s early efforts: Philadelphia attorney George Pew and Oklahoma City brothers William and Rufus Travis Amis.

In September 1950, it became the Aero Design and Engineering Company of Oklahoma. Its facilities consisted of an aircraft hangar and manufacturing facility located at what is now Wiley Post Airport near Oklahoma City. In August 1951, the first production Aero Commander, the piston-engined model 520, rolled off the assembly line. It was designed as a business class twin-engine aircraft for corporate travelers.

In 1954, the 520 was replaced by the 560 and 560A featuring a larger cabin and more powerful Lycoming piston engines. In 1955, the U.S. Air Force selected the Aero Commander as the personal transport for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, ordering 15 aircraft, two of which were used by The White House. This aircraft was a military version of the Aero Commander and was assigned a liaison function. It was used by Eisenhower to travel from Washington, D.C. to his farm at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In 1958, the Company introduced the first pressurized business aircraft in the form of the model 720 Alti-Cruiser.
The company was acquired by Rockwell-Standard in 1958 and changed its name to Aero Commander Inc. in late 1960. The aircraft added fuel injection engines and other modifications to increase performance, resulting in the 1960 introduction of the Twin Commander. With the advent of the small gas turbine engine, the 680 T model was released in 1964, followed by the 690 series in 1971, and the JetProp series in 1979. 

The company later incorporated other aircraft types developed at smaller companies and marketed them as components of the Aero Commander line. It also developed a business-twinjet, the 1121 Jet Commander. The production of this aircraft was delayed with the company finally delivering to its first customer, Timken Roller Bearing Corporation, on January 11, 1965. Aero Commander sold the manufacturing rights to Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), who produced it as the Westwind. 

In February 1981, Rockwell International sold the Aero Commander division to Gulfstream Aerospace. The final Twin Commander model 1000, released in the early 1980s, was powered by Dash 10 engines. In December 1985, Gulfstream Aerospace was acquired by Chrysler Corp. With a new focus on the business jet market, production of the Twin Commander ended in 1986.

In 1989, the Twin Commander Aircraft subsidiary of Gulfstream was acquired by Precision Aerospace Corporation. With this acquisition, the company transformed from an aircraft manufacturer to an OEM parts, service, and support provider. In 2003, the company was reincorporated as Twin Commander Aircraft, LLC. In 2005, the company was acquired from Precision in a management buyout.

==Aircraft==

Ag Commander was a brand name used by Aero Commander for their line of agricultural aircraft. Two unrelated aircraft were marketed under this name: the &quot;CallAir A-9&quot;, sold as the &quot;Ag Commander A-9&quot; and &quot;B-9&quot;, and the &quot;Ayres Thrush&quot; (aka the &quot;Snow S-2&quot;), sold as the &quot;Ag Commander S-2&quot;. Both aircraft were originally the products of smaller manufacturers that Aero Commander had purchased. The &quot;Ag Commander&quot; brand was dropped in 1970, but production continued as the Rockwell S2R Thrush Commander.

<text>Hunter Tylo (born Deborah Jo Hunter on 3 July 1962 in Fort Worth, Texas) is an author and a former American actress and model. She portrayed the role of Taylor Hayes (1990–2002, 2004–14, 2018–19) on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

==Early life==
Tylo was raised in Springstown, Texas. 

Tylo has an older sister Elizabeth as well as a younger brother named Cliff. She had an older brother Jay who died on August 29, 2018. 

Tylo has been credited as Deborah Morehart; Morehart was the last name of her first husband.

==Career==
In 1984, credited as Deborah Morehart, Tylo appeared in the sorority slasher film &quot;The Initiation&quot; with future &quot;Melrose Place&quot; actress Daphne Zuniga. Tylo subsequently became well known after playing regular roles in US daytime soap operas. Her television debut was on &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1985. Tylo was fired from the role in 1988, on the grounds of having a relationship with another cast member, Michael Tylo (whom she married in 1987).

In 1989, Tylo was cast as Marina Toscano, the half-sister of Isabella Toscano, on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. The character was an antagonist who caused trouble for one of the soap&#x27;s most popular couples, Steven &quot;Patch&quot; Johnson and Kayla Brady. Tylo later said, &quot;Everyone hated my character.[...] I hated her. They [producers] said they were going to do something with her, but they never did. [...] I dreaded going to work for the last few weeks I was on the show.&quot; The character was later killed off and Tylo left the series in 1990. 

Discouraged by her lack of success on soap operas, Tylo decided to quit acting and enrolled at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York, intending to be a pre-med student. She completed two years towards her bachelor&#x27;s degree. As she and her husband were preparing to move to New York City permanently, she was offered the role of Dr. Taylor Hayes on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. She initially resisted the part but eventually relented. She began her tenure in 1990, while still pursuing her degree at Fordham.

In 2000, Tylo released her autobiography, &quot;Making a Miracle&quot;. Tylo left &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in 2002. She returned to the show in 2004 for a two-episode appearance as a vision. In May 2005, she returned as a series regular and left the series again in July 2013. In 2014 she returned to the show for a several weeks story arc. From 2018 to 2019, she returned as a recurring character. 

Tylo has been listed twice on &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;50 Most Beautiful People In The World&quot;.

===Melrose Place Lawsuit===
In 1996, Tylo was cast in the primetime soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and opted to leave &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; to take the role. However, she was fired by &quot;Melrose Place&quot; producer Aaron Spelling prior to filming any episodes for the series when she announced she was pregnant. The character Tylo was to play, Taylor McBride, was recast with Lisa Rinna taking the role. Tylo quickly returned to &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. Tylo sued Spelling on grounds of discrimination for being pregnant and won $4.8 million from a Los Angeles jury. Spelling argued that Tylo&#x27;s pregnancy rendered her unable to play the character, who was supposed to be a sexy seductress. During the trial, Tylo published pictures of herself while pregnant, which showed that she retained a slim figure. Prior to trial, during the discovery phase of the litigation, Tylo&#x27;s lawyers won a partial victory in an interlocutory appeal challenging a lower court&#x27;s order compelling her to answer a broad range of personal questions. The Court of Appeal established Tylo&#x27;s right to refuse to answer questions in her deposition about marital problems and psychological treatment, although the Court sustained the portion of the order which compelled her to answer questions about her efforts to become pregnant, her husband&#x27;s ability or inability to impregnate her, and communications with her agent with respect to her efforts and ability to become pregnant. The case is widely recognized as an important one in establishing the right of privacy in deposition and the right of actresses to continue to work while pregnant.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
Tylo has been married three times and has four children. 

At age 17 she married her first husband, Tom Morehart, in 1980. They have a son, Christopher. Tylo and Morehart divorced in 1984. In 1987, she married actor Michael Tylo. The couple had one son, Michael Edward &quot;Mickey&quot; Tylo Jr (22 April 1988) and two daughters, Izabella Gabrielle (November 12, 1996) and Katya Ariel (January 15, 1998). In 1998, Katya was diagnosed with a rare cancer of the eye called retinoblastoma. Doctors removed the affected right eye and began chemotherapy. Later in the year, a tumor was detected in Katya&#x27;s other eye; that tumor inexplicably disappeared. Katya recovered and wears a prosthetic right eye. The couple divorced in 2005. On October 18, 2007, their 19-year-old son drowned in the family pool in Henderson, Nevada. The Clark County Coroner concluded that Michael Tylo Jr.&#x27;s death was caused by &quot;drowning due to seizure disorder&quot; and was ruled accidental.

In May 2008, Tylo filed a restraining order against boyfriend Corey Cofield, claiming that he had acted violently towards her and her children. In October 2008 the order was terminated by Tylo stating that Cofield was &quot;...actively been taking parenting classes and has attended family and couple&#x27;s therapy&quot;.

Her mother Joanne Hunter died in 2009. 

On November 29, 2009, Tylo married Gerson Archila in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled on August 30, 2018. Archila had changed his name from Gerrson Archila Morales to Gerson Archila to avoid his criminal past of poor moral character being detected. Archila has been convicted for three counts of spousal abuse, auto theft, drug paraphernalia, misrepresentation by false identity, and hiding a criminal past.

===Religion===
Tylo is a born again Christian. She attributes her daughter Katya&#x27;s recovery from cancer to constant prayer and credits her faith for helping her deal with the death of her son, Michael.

<text>Caviar or caviare is a food consisting of salt-cured roe of the family Acipenseridae. Caviar is considered a delicacy and is eaten as a garnish or spread. Traditionally, the term caviar refers only to roe from wild sturgeon in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea (beluga, ossetra and sevruga caviars). The term caviar can also describe the roe of other species of sturgeon or other fish such as paddlefish, salmon, steelhead, trout, lumpfish, whitefish, or carp.

The roe can be &quot;fresh&quot; (non-pasteurized) or pasteurized, which reduces its culinary and economic value.

==Terminology==
According to the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization, roe from any fish not belonging to the Acipenseriformes order (including Acipenseridae, or sturgeon &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, and Polyodontidae or paddlefish) are not caviar, but &quot;substitutes of caviar&quot;. This position is also adopted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the World Wide Fund for Nature, the United States Customs Service, and France.

The term &quot;caviar&quot; is sometimes used to describe dishes that are perceived to resemble caviar, such as &quot;eggplant caviar&quot; (made from eggplant) and &quot;Texas caviar&quot; (made from black-eyed peas).

The term &quot;caviare&quot; or &quot;caviar&quot; was first introduced into the English language in the late 16th century and appears to have been borrowed from a number of European languages at the same time, including French &quot;cavial&quot;, Italian &quot;caviale&quot;, Portuguese &quot;caviar&quot;, and Spanish &quot;cabial&quot;, all of which are ultimately derived from Turkish &quot;khāvyār&quot;. Up to the 17th century, archaic spellings included &quot;chauiale&quot;, &quot;cavery&quot;, and &quot;cauiarie&quot;, and as early as 1625, it was becoming a three-syllable word, with the final &quot;e&quot; being dropped in speech. In Russian, the term for caviar is &quot;ikra&quot;, a term that was used in the English language in the 16th and 17th centuries as &quot;ikary&quot;.

==History==
Caviar and sturgeon from the Sea of Azov began reaching the tables of aristocratic and noble Greeks in the 10th century, after the commencement of large-scale trading between the Byzantine Empire and Kievan Rus&#x27;. The Russians likely learned to process fish eggs with salt from Greek traders who had passed along the Black Sea coast, but it was not until after the Mongol invasions that the caviar industry developed in Astrakhan. Production was for a long time centered on the Caspian Sea, with the Iranians and Russians accounting for most of its output.

In the 16th century, François Rabelais described caviar as the finest item of what is now called hors d&#x27;oeuvre. By 1569, the Russians had conquered the entire Volga River to its mouth. The Volga and its tributaries offered a diverse range of fish, including sturgeon and its caviar, as well as sterlets, a type of small sturgeon that pleased both Russian locals and foreigners.

Caviar was eaten differently in the past compared to today. Medieval Russians often ate it hot. &quot;The Travels of Olearius in Seventeenth-Century Russia&quot; says &quot;they expel the roe from the membrane in which it is contained, salt it, and after it has stood for six to eight days, mix it with pepper and finely chopped onions. Some also add vinegar and country butter before serving it. It is not a bad dish. If one pours a bit of lemon juice over it, instead of vinegar, it gives a good appetite, and has a restorative effect.&quot; 

==Varieties==
The main types of caviar from sturgeon species native to the Caspian Sea are Beluga, Sterlet, Kaluga hybrid, Ossetra, Siberian sturgeon and Sevruga. American White Sturgeon caviar is abundant and native to California and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The rarest and costliest is from beluga sturgeon that swim in the Caspian Sea, which is bordered by Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan. Wild caviar production was suspended in Russia between 2008 and 2011 to allow wild stocks to replenish. Azerbaijan and Iran also allow the fishing of sturgeon off their coasts. Beluga caviar is prized for its soft, extremely large (pea-size) eggs. It can range in colour from pale silver-grey to black. It is followed by the small golden sterlet caviar which is rare and was once reserved for Russian, Iranian and Austrian royalty. Next in quality is the medium-sized, light brown to rich brown Ossetra, also known as Russian caviar. Others in the quality ranking are the grey sevruga caviar, the Chinese Kaluga caviar, and the American white sturgeon caviar. The Siberian variety with black beads is similar to sevruga and is popular because of its reduced (five years) harvest period, but it has a higher brine content than other kinds. The Chinese Kaluga hybrid varies in colour from dark grey to light golden green and is a close cousin of beluga caviar.

===Quality factors and cost===
An expensive caviar example at sold for £20,000 (then US$34,500) is the Iranian &#x27;Almas&#x27; product (from , &quot;diamond&quot;) produced from the eggs of a rare albino sturgeon between 60 and 100 years old from the southern Caspian Sea. Wild beluga sturgeon caviar from the Caspian Sea was priced in 2012 at $16,000 per . Cheaper alternatives have been developed from the roe of whitefish and the North Atlantic salmon.

Conventional sturgeon caviar was priced in 2014 at about $105 per and from albino sturgeon up to $800 per ounce. Other quality factors are texture – with firmness having higher quality value – flavour qualities, such as creaminess, butter taste, and brine or mild fish finish, and whether the caviar was taken from the fish by massage (higher value) rather than by killing it. Caviar is generally sold in ounces. An ounce of sturgeon caviar costs between $45 and $1,000, depending on the variety of sturgeon and other factors.

==Industry==
===China===
China produces the most caviar of any single country. The largest caviar company in the world is the Chinese brand Kaluga Queen, which cultivates sturgeon at Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang.

===Russia===
In the wake of over-fishing, the harvest and sale of black caviar were banned in Russia in 2007. The ban on sturgeon fishing in the Caspian Sea has led to the development of aquaculture as an economically viable means of commercial caviar production. Russian caviar exports were also banned from 2002 to 2011.

===Italy===

Cristoforo da Messisbugo in his book &quot;Libro novo nel qual si insegna a far d&#x27;ogni sorte di vivanda&quot;, Venice, 1564, at page 110, gave the first recorded recipe in Italy about extraction of the eggs from the roe and caviar preparation &quot;to be consumed fresh or to preserve&quot;.
The writer and voyager Jérôme Lalande in his book &quot;Voyage en Italie&quot;, Paris, 1771, vol. 8, page 269, noted that many sturgeon were caught in the Po delta area in the territory of Ferrara.
In 1753 a diplomatic war broke out between the Papal States, governing the Ferrara territory, and the Venetian Republic about sturgeon fishing rights in the Po River, the border between the two states. From about 1920 and until 1942, there was a shop in Ferrara, named &quot;Nuta&quot; from the nickname of the owner Benvenuta Ascoli, that processed all the sturgeons caught in the Po River for caviar extraction, using an elaboration of the original Messisbugo recipe, and shipped it to Italy and Europe. A new owner sporadically continued production until 1972, when the sturgeon stopped swimming up the Po River. Since 2015, some sturgeon have reappeared in the Po.

Currently, Italian caviar is obtained almost entirely from bred sturgeons. The caviar production is concentrated predominantly in Brescia, which is considered the capital of Italian caviar: in this area, in Calvisano, is located the world&#x27;s largest sturgeon farm that produces annually 25 tonnes of caviar. Italy is a top producer of caviar.

===North America===
In the early 20th century, Canada and the United States were the major caviar suppliers to Europe; they harvested roe from the lake sturgeon in the North American Midwest, and from the shortnose sturgeon and the Atlantic sturgeon spawning in the rivers of the East Coast of the United States. The American caviar industry started when Henry Schacht, a German immigrant, opened a business catching sturgeon on the Delaware River. He treated his caviar with German salt and exported a great deal of it to Europe. Around the same time, sturgeon was fished from the Columbia River on the West Coast of the United States, also supplying caviar. American caviar was so plentiful at the time that it was given away at bars to induce or prolong patrons&#x27; thirst.

Today, the shortnose sturgeon is rated &quot;Vulnerable&quot; in the IUCN Red List of endangered species and rated &quot;Endangered&quot; per the Endangered Species Act. With the depletion of Caspian and Black Sea caviar, production of farmed or &quot;sustainable&quot; caviar has greatly increased. In particular, northern California is reported to account for 70% to 80% of U.S. production.

In 2021, a significant illegal sturgeon egg harvesting and selling ring run in part by the former top sturgeon biologist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was discovered and broken up by investigators.

In coastal British Columbia, Fraser River white sturgeon are sustainably farmed to produce caviar.

===Spain===

The 17th-century book &quot;Don Quixote&quot; mentions &quot;cavial&quot; in a banquet of German pilgrims.
Until 1992, sturgeons and caviar were collected at the lower parts of rivers Guadalquivir, Ebro, Duero and Tajo.
From 1932 to 1970, the Ybarra family had a factory in Coria del Río.
Overfishing, pollution and the Alcalá del Río dam eliminated the wild population of &quot;Acipenser naccarii&quot;.
In Spain, a fish farm called Caviar de Riofrío produces organic caviar at Loja, Granada, Andalusia.

===Uruguay===
As well with Canada and the United States, Uruguay has become a major producer and exporter.

===Israel===
Kibbutz Dan in Israel produces four tons of caviar a year. The farm is fed by the Dan River, a tributary of the Jordan River.

===Madagascar===
Madagascar is the first African country that produces and exports caviar since 2018.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, caviar production is relatively new and smaller in scale. Caviar is harvested from farmed sturgeon fish in Tanjung Malim, Perak. The caviar produced here is marketed as &quot;tropical caviar&quot;. The first Malaysian brand of tropical caviar was launched in March 2019.

==Ecology==
Overfishing, smuggling and pollution caused by sewage entry into the Caspian Sea have considerably reduced the sea&#x27;s sturgeon population.

In September 2005, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service banned the import of Caspian Sea Beluga caviar to protect the endangered Beluga sturgeon; a month later, the ban was extended to include Beluga caviar from the entire Black Sea basin. In January 2006, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) supported an international embargo on caviar export. In January 2007, this ban was partly lifted, allowing the sale of 96 tons of caviar, 15% below the official 2005 level. In July 2010, Russia and some other CIS countries restarted the export of caviar. The 2010 quotas allow for the export of three tons of beluga, 17 tons of sevruga and 27 tons of osetra. In September 2010, Kazakhstan launched a state monopoly brand, Zhaik Balyk, from the Kazakh word for the Ural River. Under the CITES agreement, Kazakhstan was granted the right to produce 13 of the 80 tons allowed up until 28 February 2011.

==Extraction==
Commercial caviar production historically involved stunning the fish and extracting the ovaries. Another method of extracting caviar is by removing eggs through a small incision, which allows the female to continue producing roe. Other farmers use a process called &quot;stripping&quot;, which extracts the caviar from the fish via a small incision made along the urogenital muscle when the fish is deemed to be ready to be processed. An ultrasound is used to determine the correct timing. Removing the caviar by massage may yield higher quality and a more sustainable source.

==Preparation==
Preparation follows a sequence that has not significantly changed over the last century. First, the ovaries are removed from a sedated female sturgeon and passed through a sieve to remove the membrane. Freed roes are rinsed to wash away impurities. Roes are now ready to become caviar by adding a precise amount of salt for taste and preservation. The fresh product is tasted and graded according to quality. Finally, the eggs are packed into lacquer-lined tins that will be further processed or sold directly to customers.

==Substitutes==

A sturgeon caviar imitation is a black or red-coloured lumpsucker caviar sold throughout Europe in small glass jars.

In Sweden and Finland, the roes of many fish species, including vendace, burbot, salmon and common whitefish, are also commonly eaten in a similar manner as caviar. However, they are not caviar &#x27;substitutes&#x27; but are enjoyed in their own right.

Spherification of liquids with alginate (a seaweed polysaccharide) is used to recreate caviar&#x27;s texture. With liquids flavored to resemble caviar, one obtains kosher and vegan caviar substitutes. They resemble beluga caviar in appearance and are either used as a food prop for television and film or enjoyed by vegetarians and other people worldwide.

In Scandinavia, a type of sandwich spread is available, made from smoked cod roe and other ingredients, which is referred to as &quot;smörgåskaviar&quot; (meaning &quot;sandwich caviar&quot;). Outside Scandinavia, the product is referred to as &quot;creamed smoked roe&quot; or in French as &quot;Caviar de Lysekil&quot;.

==Storage and nutrition==
Caviar is highly perishable and must be kept refrigerated until consumption.

Caviar is 48% water, 25% protein, 18% fats, and 4% carbohydrates.

In a common serving amount of 16 grams (one tablespoon), caviar supplies 44 kilocalories of food energy, 53% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin B12, and moderate amounts (10-15% DV) of sodium, iron, magnesium, and selenium, with no other micronutrients in significant content.

<doc id="825888" wikidata="Q1639997" url="?curid=825888" title="Spontaneous remission">
<text>Spontaneous remission, also called spontaneous healing or spontaneous regression, is an unexpected improvement or cure from a disease that usually progresses. These terms are commonly used for unexpected transient or final improvements in cancer. Spontaneous remissions concern cancers of the haematopoietic system (blood cancer, e.g., leukemia), while spontaneous regressions concern palpable tumors; however, both terms are often used interchangeably.

==Definition==
The spontaneous regression and remission from cancer was defined by Everson and Cole in their 1966 book as &quot;the partial or complete disappearance of a malignant tumour in the absence of all treatment, or in the presence of therapy which is considered inadequate to exert significant influence on neoplastic disease.&quot;

==Frequency of spontaneous regression in cancer==
It has long been assumed that spontaneous regressions, let alone cures, from cancer are rare phenomena, and that some forms of cancer are more prone to unexpected courses (melanoma, neuroblastoma, lymphoma) than others (carcinoma). Frequency was estimated to be about 1 in 100,000 cancers; however, this proportion might be an under- or an overestimate. For one, not all cases of spontaneous regression can be apprehended, either because the case was not well documented or the physician was not willing to publish, or simply because the patient ceased to attend a clinic any more. On the other hand, for the past 100 years almost all cancer patients have received some form of treatment, and the influence of that treatment cannot always be excluded.

It is likely that the frequency of spontaneous regression in small tumors has been drastically underrated. In a carefully designed study on mammography it was found that 22% of all breast cancer cases underwent spontaneous regression.

==Causes==
Everson and Cole offered as explanation for spontaneous regression from cancer:

Challis and Stam, even more at a loss, concluded in 1989, &quot;In summary, we are left to conclude that, although a great number of interesting and unusual cases continue to be published annually, there is still little conclusive data that explains the occurrence of spontaneous regression.&quot;

Apoptosis (programmed cell death) and angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels) are sometimes discussed as possible causes of spontaneous regression. But both mechanisms need appropriate biochemical triggers and cannot initiate on their own. Indeed, in many cancer cells apoptosis is defective, and angiogenesis is activated, both of these effects being caused by mutations in cancer cells; cancer exists because both mechanisms are malfunctioning.

There are several case reports of spontaneous regressions from cancer occurring after a fever brought on by infection, suggesting a possible causal connection. If this coincidence in time would be a causal connection, it should as well precipitate as prophylactic effect, i.e. feverish infections should lower the risk to develop cancer later. This could be confirmed by collecting epidemiological studies.

<text>A nurse anesthetist is an advanced practice nurse who administers anesthesia for surgery or other medical procedures. They are involved in the administration of anesthesia in a majority of countries, with varying levels of autonomy. Nurse anesthetists provide all services of anesthesia for patients before, during, and after surgery. Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, (CRNA) are dedicated to the safe administration of anesthesia delivery and work within a diverse team. They are dedicated to patient advocacy, safety and professional development. In some localities, nurse anesthetists provide anesthesia to patients independently; in others they do so under the supervision of physicians. In the United States, the physician may be an anesthesiologist, surgeon, or podiatrist. The International Federation of Nurse Anesthetists was established in 1989 as a forum for developing standards of education, practice, and a code of ethics.

== History of CRNAs ==

In the United States, nurse anesthetists are called Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). CRNAs account for approximately half of the anesthesia providers in the United States and are the main providers of anesthesia in rural America.

Nurses have been providing anesthesia care to patients since the American Civil War. Nurse anesthetists are considered an essential role to the health care workforce. They provide pain management and emergency services, including airway management and blood and fluid resuscitation, which was very important to patients in the Civil War. Depending on the local system of healthcare, they participate only during the operation itself, or may also be involved before and after (for preanesthetic assessment and immediate postoperative management). The National Association of Nurse Anesthetists professional association was established by Agatha Hodgkins in 1931. It was renamed the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists in 1939. The group established educational institutions for nurse anesthetists in 1952, and established the CRNA certification in 1957. AANA continuing education was established in 1977. As of 2011, some 92% of CRNAs in the U.S. were represented by the AANA.

Scope of practice rules vary between healthcare facility and state. Before 2001, Medicare required that physicians supervise CRNAs in the administration of anesthesia. In 2001, Medicare&#x27;s rules changed, allowing individual states to decide whether CRNAs may administer anesthesia without physician supervision. In the absence of a state requirement that physicians supervise CRNAs, individual healthcare facilities decide. CRNA organizations have lobbied in many states for the ability to practice without physician supervision; these efforts are opposed by physician groups. In 2011, sixteen states granted CRNAs autonomy, allowing them to practice without physician oversight. In 2017, there were 27 states in which CRNAs could independently practice (that is, &quot;without a written collaborative agreement, supervision or conditions for practice&quot;). In 2020, there was no physician supervision requirement for nurse anesthetists in ambulatory surgical facilities in 31 states In states that have opted out of supervision, the Joint Commission and CMS recognize CRNAs as licensed independent practitioners. In states requiring supervision, CRNAs have liability separate from supervising practitioners and are able to administer anesthesia independently of anesthesiologists.

== Education ==
A nurse anesthetist will need to complete two to three years of higher education, beyond the bachelor&#x27;s of nursing degree.

Before becoming a nurse anesthetist, one must complete a Bachelors of Science in Nursing degree. A minimum of one year of full-time work experience as a registered nurse in a critical care setting is required before applying to CRNA school. The average experience of RNs entering nurse anesthesia educational programs is 2.9 years. Nurse anesthetists are required to attend accredited educational programs covering all areas of anesthesia. This education provides training about the anesthetics needed for patients in any type of procedure or surgery. After completing an accredited program, CRNAs must pass a national certification exam to acquire this designation. It is important to have the best education for this field for the significance of anesthesia. By 2025 the Council on Accreditation, the organization which accredits nurse anesthetist programs, will require all graduating CRNAs to be doctorate prepared.

== Salary ==
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a CRNA salary is around $181,040. Salaries within the US vary by state. Overall employment for nurse anesthetists and other medical professions is projected to grow 45 percent from 2020 to 2030.

== Work environment ==
CRNAs typically work in healthcare settings such as emergency rooms, intensive care units, and operating rooms. Their environment is with medical and surgical teams with procedures that can occur anytime. Some partnerships they work with are anesthesiologists, dentists, surgeons, and other medics in serving patients who need of receiving anesthesia. Nurse anesthetists are an essential part of everyday medical facilities. The need of CRNAs is anticipated to grow.

== Skills and procedures ==
Nurse anesthetists work with anesthesiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologist assistants, anesthesia technicians, and others. CRNAs communicate with the surgeon and interdisciplinary team to design an anesthesia plan for a patient. Some procedures that nurse anesthetists offer include:
*Evaluation of the patient prior to anesthesia
*Physical assessment and pre-operative teaching before the anesthesia
*Administering anesthesia
*Airway management 
== Roles and responsibilities ==
CRNAs have important roles when it comes to patient care. They need to meet all the patients&#x27; standards and help ensure the patient is in good condition before receiving an anesthesia plan.Some of the roles and responsibilities a CRNA need to require for this position include: 
*Bedside manner 
*Record-keeping skills 
*Communication skills 
*Teamwork with other nurses and doctors 
*Inhaled anesthesia administration 
*Administration of blood and medication 
*Epidural placement 
*Placement of arterial and central lines 

The CRNA profession requires an understanding, accurate, and responsible attitude to work this position. You must have strong communication skills with the patient and your team to become a CRNA. The freedom of a nurse anesthetist is expanded compared to an RN that allows you to oversee the patient and with your team. 

== Nurse anesthetist vs. anesthesiologist ==
Nurse anesthetist and physician anesthesiologists have certain distinctions, however they share many similarities. Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists are nurses who have specialized training to perform anesthesia. In comparison, an anesthesiologist is a trained physician who specializes in anesthesia.

== Terminology ==
The AANA recognizes &quot;Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist&quot;, &quot;CRNA&quot;, &quot;nurse anesthetist&quot;, and &quot;nurse anesthesiologist&quot; as equivalent titles. The use of &quot;nurse anesthetist&quot; is substantially more common than the use of &quot;nurse anesthesiologist;&quot; terms &quot;anesthesia nurse&quot; and &quot;anesthetist nurse&quot; are unheard of.

Use of the term &quot;nurse anesthesiologist&quot; has been criticized by those who argue that the term &quot;anesthesiologist&quot; should be limited to medical doctors. For example, groups representing anesthesiologists and other medical doctors, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), oppose the use of this phrase to describe CRNAs and call it misleading.

In 2021, after a year-long rebranding effort, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists changed its name to the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology. The name change was condemned by physician groups, including the AMA, ASA, American Board of Anesthesiology, American Board of Medical Specialties, and American Osteopathic Association. Physicians&#x27; organizations said that the name change was &quot;title misappropriation&quot; that was deceptive, misleading to patients, and cause confusion in care settings.

In 2021, the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld a decision by the New Hampshire Board of Medicine that blocked nurse anesthetists from identifying themselves as anesthesiologists and limited use of the title to MDs and DOs specializing in anesthesiology.

<doc id="825926" wikidata="Q2540765" url="?curid=825926" title="Cameo-Parkway Records">
<text>Cameo-Parkway Records was the parent company of Cameo Records and Parkway Records, which were major American Philadelphia-based record labels from 1956 (for Cameo) and 1958 (for Parkway) to 1967. Among the types of music released were doo-wop, dance hits, popular/rock, rockabilly, big band, garage rock, soul and novelty records.

Until 1962, Cameo was also the parent company name for both labels, and Parkway was a subsidiary. In 1962, the parent company was renamed from Cameo to Cameo-Parkway, to give both labels equal status. In some foreign markets, Cameo-Parkway was also a label name, issuing records by artists from both labels. The Cameo-Parkway catalogue is currently owned by ABKCO Records.

==History==
Cameo Records was founded in December 1956 in Philadelphia by Bernie Lowe and Kal Mann; it has no connection to the 1920s record label Cameo Records. Parkway, initially a subsidiary label, was formed in 1958.

Mann and Lowe had been a successful songwriting team prior to the start of the label, with Mann writing lyrics and Lowe the music; their biggest hit prior to starting the label was Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear&quot;. Dave Appell joined the label from its inception as A&amp;R director, and the three worked together as a production team on many early Cameo releases. Mann and Lowe wrote many of the label&#x27;s early singles, while Mann and Appell also became a successful songwriting team that was responsible for many of the label&#x27;s hits, particularly after Lowe cut back on his songwriting around 1961, to attend to the business of running the label. In addition, Appell&#x27;s group the Applejacks functioned as Cameo&#x27;s house band for the first few years of, serving as backing musicians for the label&#x27;s vocalists as well as issuing a handful of instrumental singles on their own. Lowe, also a musician, played piano on many early tracks.

The first hit for Cameo was &quot;Butterfly&quot; by Charlie Gracie, which reached No. 1 nationally in early 1957; it was also Cameo-Parkway&#x27;s first of five chart-toppers. Throughout the remainder of the decade, Cameo continued to have hits by groups like the R&amp;B group the Rays, who had a No. 3 hit with &quot;Silhouettes&quot; later that year (picked up from independent XYZ Records). In 1958, the label had further hits with &quot;Dinner With Drac&quot;, a novelty record by John Zacherle in the top 10, and &quot;Mexican Hat Rock&quot;, an instrumental by the Applejacks, in the top 20.

A major factor in Cameo-Parkway&#x27;s success was its relationship with the Philadelphia-based TV program &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. Being located in the same city where this popular nationally broadcast music show was produced meant that Cameo-Parkway artists were always available to perform on the show—especially in the event any other act should cancel. Host and producer Dick Clark has spoken of the &quot;warm relationship&quot; his program had with Cameo-Parkway, and of the label&#x27;s willingness to ensure that quality musical acts were always available to the program on short notice. The label benefited tremendously from the arrangement, as the exposure many Cameo-Parkway artists received on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; helped propel them to stardom.

In 1959, Bobby Rydell scored his first hits with &quot;Kissin&#x27; Time&quot; and &quot;We Got Love&quot; on Cameo. From 1960 to 1964, Rydell was the label&#x27;s second largest hit maker after Chubby Checker, scoring with such hits as &quot;Wild One&quot; (his biggest hit, peaking at No. 2), &quot;Swingin&#x27; School&quot;, &quot;Volare&quot;, &quot;The Cha-Cha-Cha&quot;, &quot;Forget Him&quot; and others.

Chubby Checker had a minor novelty hit in the summer of 1959 called &quot;The Class&quot;, which featured Checker doing comic imitations of singers Fats Domino, the Coasters, Elvis Presley, drummer Cozy Cole, and Ricky Nelson, Frankie Avalon, and Fabian Forte as The Chipmunks. In 1960, Checker&#x27;s cover of Hank Ballard&#x27;s &quot;The Twist&quot; became Parkway&#x27;s first big hit. Although Ballard&#x27;s version only reached No. 16 on the R&amp;B chart in 1958, Checker&#x27;s version went to No. 1 in 1960, and again in early 1962. Checker had several hits, including &quot;Pony Time&quot; (his second No. 1), &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Slow Twistin&#x27;&quot; (with Dee Dee Sharp), &quot;Limbo Rock&quot;, &quot;Popeye the Hitchhiker&quot;, &quot;Birdland&quot; and others.

Around 1961, the Cameo and Parkway labels began developing some new stars. The vocal group the Dovells, which featured Len Barry as the lead singer, released &quot;Bristol Stomp&quot;, which reached No. 2 in late 1961, followed by &quot;Bristol Twistin&#x27; Annie,&quot; &quot;(Do The New) Continental,&quot; &quot;Hully Gully Baby&quot; and other dance-related songs in 1962 and 1963. &quot;You Can&#x27;t Sit Down&quot;, a vocal version of the Phil Upchurch instrumental hit, was No. 35 in Cash Box magazine&#x27;s year end-survey for 1963. The R&amp;B quartet the Orlons released &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot;, which hit No. 2 in the summer of 1962. They had a few more top 20 hits, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Hang Up&quot;, &quot;South Street&quot;, &quot;Not Me&quot; and &quot;Crossfire!&quot;

Fifteen-year-old Dee Dee Sharp had done a duet with Chubby Checker on &quot;Slow Twistin&#x27;&quot;, and recorded her first solo single, &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot;, on the same day. It went to No. 2 in the spring of 1962. More dance songs followed, including the follow-up &quot;Gravy&quot; and another dance song, &quot;Ride!&quot;

In the summer of 1963 the No. 1 hit &quot;So Much in Love&quot; by the smooth R&amp;B group the Tymes marked the last hit from Cameo-Parkway&#x27;s peak period.

In the UK, Cameo and Parkway recordings were released first on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label, then on London Records, then on Top Rank, then on EMI&#x27;s Columbia label, then briefly Pye International, before finally appearing on their own Pye-distributed Cameo-Parkway label.

== Decline and shutdown ==
In early 1964, three near-simultaneous events sent Cameo-Parkway into a sharp decline from which it would never fully recover. The first was the move of &quot;American Bandstand&quot; from Philadelphia to Los Angeles in February. Suddenly, Cameo-Parkway&#x27;s primary source of national exposure and promotion was gone. Just as devastating (as it was to many other American labels) was the second event: the onslaught of the British Invasion in 1964/1965, which dramatically changed the tastes of the American record buying public. In a 2021 retrospective, Ken Barnes, analyzing the hit acts of 1963, noted that Cameo-Parkway acts were among the hardest hit by the Invasion, with most acts associated with them suffering permanent career damage; Barnes also cited the &quot;Bandstand&quot; move and the rise of Motown Records as other factors in Cameo-Parkway&#x27;s downfall. Cameo tried to keep pace by licensing a handful of early British beat group singles, including the first two singles by the Kinks, but none made the US charts.

The third and final event was that Bernie Lowe had become increasingly disenchanted with the business side of record making and, suffering from nervous exhaustion and bouts of depression, he sold his stake in the company in 1964. Mann and Appel soon followed. By mid-1965 none of Cameo-Parkway&#x27;s founding trio were associated with the label, and their biggest stars (Bobby Rydell and Chubby Checker) had also left. Cameo&#x27;s new management was unable to replicate its success with artists like Jo Ann Campbell, Maynard Ferguson, Clark Terry, the instrumental group LeRoy &amp; His Rockin&#x27; Fellers, and TV-stars-turned-singers such as Clint Eastwood and Merv Griffin.

In mid-1966, 23-year-old Neil Bogart was made the label&#x27;s new head of Artists and repertoire (A&amp;R). Turning to Midwestern garage bands and orchestrated soul productions (including the distribution of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Windy C&quot; label), Bogart managed to shepherd in a brief Cameo-Parkway renaissance. The last major hits for the label were &quot;96 Tears&quot; by Question Mark and the Mysterians (picked up from independent Pa-Go-Go Records), which went to No. 1 in the fall of 1966, a novelty remake of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; by comedian Bill Minkin imitating Robert F. Kennedy under the name Senator Bobby (1966), and &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot; by the Ohio Express (originally on the Attack label as by The Rare Breed) (1967). Bogart also signed Bob Seger to his first recording contract, and Cameo-Parkway issued Seger&#x27;s first five singles, which were all huge regional hits in Michigan but failed to catch fire nationally.

In mid-1967, Cameo-Parkway entered into a short-lived distribution pact with MGM Records and released four more albums (two on Cameo, one on Parkway and one on Vando), and three more singles (one on Parkway and two on Vando). Cameo&#x27;s final single, &quot;Billy Sunshine&quot; by Evie Sands (KC-2002), was originally released with the red and yellow &quot;CP&quot; label then reissued with the new MGM-designated label. For the first time both label names appeared on the record labels, although neither the Cameo or Parkway name was emphasized, and the two series continued to use separate catalog numbering systems. That suggests that a gradual merger of the two labels was in progress, but it was never completed. By late 1967, after financial problems worsened, the Cameo-Parkway company was sold to Allen Klein, and renamed ABKCO Records, with Bell Records acquiring its remaining subsidiary, Vando label. Cameo Parkway Records was shut down in September 1967. Bogart landed feet first at the newly formed Buddah Records, founded by former MGM Records executive Art Kass, and brought along the former Cameo Parkway promotion staff.

== Subsidiary labels ==
Wyncote Records was a budget label started in 1964. It released compilation albums of material by Cameo and Parkway artists as well as new albums of soundtrack and easy listening music. These records were mainly distributed in drug, book and department stores, usually through rack jobbers.

Other related labels, mostly independently owned but distributed by Cameo-Parkway, included
*Audio Arts!: The first two singles were released under Cameo/Parkway before the label was sold to Amy / Mala / Bell
*Chariot: At least five singles were released under Cameo/Parkway before the label was sold to Amy / Mala / Bell
*Cheltenham: At least four singles released from 1965–1966
*Cotton: At least three singles released in 1962
*Fairmount, featuring Lonnie Youngblood: At least 27 singles have been released on this label
*Ivanhoe: At least one single was distributed under Cameo/Parkway
*Key-Loc: At least one single was distributed under Cameo/Parkway by Sunny and the Sunliners
*Lucky Eleven, based in Flint, Michigan, featuring Terry Knight and the Pack, which eventually transformed into Grand Funk Railroad
*Sentar: Owned by the families of pop group the New Colony Six (the label&#x27;s only group), four singles and one album were released under Sentar&#x27;s Cameo/Parkway distribution
*Showplace, featuring the Yellow Payges (at least two singles distributed)
*Tomorrow: Originally distributed by Atco, then by Cameo/Parkway. At least two singles were distributed under C/P
*Vando: Owned by Van McCoy, five singles and one album were released under the label&#x27;s C/P distribution, mostly by Chris Bartley
*Winchester: Only two singles were released under this label, one by the Tymes and the other by the Spokesmen
*Windy C: Owned by Curtis Mayfield, eight singles and one album were released on this label, mostly by the Five Stairsteps

===Philadelphia connection===
Several C/P labels were based on hometown suburbs, highways and landmarks, including...
*Parkway: Benjamin Franklin Parkway
*Fairmount: Fairmount Park; there is also a Fairmount Ave. north of the Philadelphia Museum of Art
*Wyncote: Northern suburb of Philadelphia where C/P founder Bernie Lowe resided and set up office for C/P
*Cheltenham: Cheltenham Avenue; there is also a Cheltenham High School in suburban Wyncote

== Reissues ==
ABKCO reissued Cameo-Parkway recordings in the early 1970s, but allowed them to fall out of print after that time. Virtually all Cameo-Parkway recordings, including all of their numerous chart hits, were officially unavailable in any format for about 30 years, from 1975 to 2005. In May 2005 ABKCO revived the Cameo-Parkway name for reissues only, and released a multi-CD box set of the labels&#x27; most notable output: &quot;Cameo-Parkway: 1957-1967&quot;. In October 2005 it began to issue various single-artist &quot;best of&quot; CD compilations, including Charlie Gracie, Bobby Rydell, Chubby Checker, Dee Dee Sharp, the Dovells, the Orlons, the Tymes and Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians. A various artists CD titled &quot;Cameo-Parkway: The Greatest Hits&quot; was also issued, as well as two digital-only compilations: &quot;Holiday Hits From Cameo Parkway&quot; and &quot;Original Northern Soul Hits From Cameo Parkway&quot;.

ABKCO has also begun to license its repertoire out to other labels, allowing Universal Music Group to license some songs for its &quot;Complete Introduction to Northern Soul&quot; box set in 2008, and allowing Collectors&#x27; Choice Music to reissue several albums in 2010. Despite these reissues, many more obscure Cameo-Parkway recordings, and even a few of their lesser hits, remain unavailable.

<text>An agricultural aircraft is an aircraft that has been built or converted for agricultural use – usually aerial application of pesticides (crop dusting) or fertilizer (aerial topdressing); in these roles, they are referred to as &quot;crop dusters&quot; or &quot;top dressers&quot;. Agricultural aircraft are also used for hydroseeding.

The most common agricultural aircraft are fixed-wing – such as the Air Tractor, Cessna Ag-wagon, Gippsland GA200, Grumman Ag Cat, PZL-106 KRUK, M-18 Dromader, PAC Fletcher, Piper PA-36 Pawnee Brave, Embraer EMB 202 Ipanema, and Rockwell Thrush Commander – but helicopters are also used.

Generally, agricultural aircraft have piston or turboprop engines. The only known exception is the Polish PZL M-15 Belphegor which has a jet engine.

==Early use of aircraft in agriculture==
Crop dusting with insecticides began in the 1920s in the United States. The first widely used agricultural aircraft were converted war-surplus biplanes, such as the De Havilland Tiger Moth and Stearman. After more effective insecticides and fungicides were developed in the 1940s, and aerial topdressing was developed by government research in New Zealand, purpose-built agricultural fixed-wing aircraft became common.

==Designs==
In the US and Europe, agricultural aircraft are typically small, simple, and rugged. Most have spraying systems attached to the trailing edges of their wings, and pumps are usually driven by wind turbines. In places where farms are larger, such as New Zealand, Australia, the former Warsaw Pact nations, and parts of the developing world, larger and more powerful aircraft have been used, including turboprop powered aircraft such as the PAC Cresco, twin engined types such as the Lockheed Lodestar and the WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor – a turbofan-powered biplane. All tend to be of simple, rugged STOL design. Sometimes a ram air turbine is used as an auxiliary power source for the pumping machinery instead of taking power directly from the engine (because this can be installed without any modifications of the airplane&#x27;s mechanical systems). In places where dedicated use as an agricultural aircraft is uneconomic, utility types such as the Antonov An-2 biplane and De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver have been used.

In the case of helicopters, tanks are placed on or outside the body of the aircraft, while a spray rig, extending outward to the sides, is attached well below the main rotor blades. Hydroseeding is often done by helicopters using tanks and drop systems much like those used for aerial firefighting.

==Techniques==
To reduce drift of the sprayed materials, agricultural pilots attempt to fly just above the crops being treated. Fields are often surrounded by obstacles such as trees, telephone lines, and farm buildings. Purpose-built agricultural airplanes have strengthened cockpits to protect the pilot if an accident occurs.

==Conflicting views on aerial spraying==

Aerial spraying has been controversial since the 1960s, due to environmental concerns about pesticide drift (raised for example by Rachel Carson&#x27;s book &quot;Silent Spring&quot;). It is now often subject to restrictions, for example spraying pesticide is generally banned in Sweden, although exceptions can be made such as for an area plagued by mosquitoes during summer. The aerial spread of fertilizer has also raised concerns, for example in New Zealand fertilizer entering streams has been found to disproportionately promote growth of species that are more able to exploit the nutrients, in a process known as eutrophication, which has led to restrictions on topdressing near waterways.

<doc id="825933" wikidata="Q61813" url="?curid=825933" title="Abraham Gotthelf Kästner">
<text>Abraham Gotthelf Kästner (27 September 1719 – 20 June 1800) was a German mathematician and epigrammatist.

He was known in his professional life for writing textbooks and compiling encyclopedias rather than for original research. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was one of his doctoral students, and admired the man greatly. He became most well-known for his epigrammatic poems. The crater Kästner on the Moon is named after him.

== Life ==

Kästner was the son of law professor Abraham Kästner. He married Anna Rosina Baumann in 1757 after a 12-year engagement. She died on 4 March 1758, less than a year later, of lung disease. Later Kästner had a daughter Catharine with his cleaning lady.

Kästner studied law, philosophy, physics, mathematics and metaphysics in Leipzig from 1731, and was appointed a Notary in 1733. He gained his habilitation from the University of Leipzig in 1739, and lectured there in mathematics, philosophy, logic and law, becoming an associate professor in 1746. In 1751 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1756 he took up a position as a full professor of natural philosophy and geometry at the University of Göttingen. In 1763, succeeding Tobias Mayer, he became director of the observatory as well. One of his doctoral students was the physicist and aphorist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who became a colleague of his at Göttingen. Other notable doctoral students were Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben, Johann Pfaff (doctoral advisor of Carl Friedrich Gauss), Johann Tobias Mayer, Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes, Farkas Bolyai (father of János Bolyai), and Georg Klügel. Kästner died in 1800 in Göttingen.

== Work ==
Kästner became most well known for his poems, which appeared first in print without his consent in 1781 and were notable for their biting humour and sharp irony on different contemporary personalities. They were published in &quot;Vermischten Schriften 1 und 2&quot; (Altenburg 1783, 2 volumes), and further poems were published in &quot;Gesammelten poetischen und prosaischen schönwissenschaftlichen Werken&quot; (Berlin 1841, 4 volumes) and later in Joseph Kürschner&#x27;s &quot;Deutscher Nationalliteratur&quot;, volume 73 (hrsg. von Minor; Stuttgart 1883).

His numerous mathematical writings include &quot;Anfangsgründe der Mathematik&quot; (&quot;Foundations of Mathematics&quot;) (Göttingen 1758-69, 4 volumes; 6th edition 1800) and &quot;Geschichte der Mathematik&quot; (&quot;History of Mathematics&quot;) (Göttingen 1796-1800, 4 volumes). &quot;Geschichte der Mathematik&quot; is considered an astute work, but lacks a comprehensive overview of all subsections of mathematics.

He also translated many of the Proceedings of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences into German, including all volumes of the Proceedings (&quot;Handlingar&quot;) between 1749 and 1781 and some of New Proceedings (&quot;Nya handlingar&quot;) from 1784 to 1792.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1789.

<doc id="825942" wikidata="Q5307057" url="?curid=825942" title="Dress to Kill (Eddie Izzard)">
<text>Dress to Kill is the title of a performance by Eddie Izzard, and is a continuation of the British comedian&#x27;s surrealist, ideas-based comedy. The VHS was recorded during a performance in San Francisco, California, United States. However, the tour was a global one. During this tour Izzard also wrote the book &quot;Dress to Kill&quot; with David Quantick (photographs by Steve Double), published by Virgin Books in hardback in 1998 and paperback in 2000.

Izzard&#x27;s humour includes observations on the American concept of history, beginning with his quote &quot;I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from&quot; and continuing through diversions about the belief that all Europeans live in castles (&quot;we just long for a bungalow or something&quot;) and the attitude of Americans toward historical landmarks. Additionally, Izzard takes time to explain his background as an &quot;executive&quot; transvestite and how it affected his desire to join the military. This is explained through a proposal for the Army&#x27;s &quot;first battalion transvestite brigade...with &quot;fantastic&quot; makeup and a fantastic gun.&quot;

The centerpiece of the performance is a retelling of British history from Stonehenge through to the Reformation. This is done with Izzard adopting a very Italian accent (and miming riding on a Vespa) to signify the Pope talking to Henry VIII (&quot;who is Sean Connery for this film&quot;) and explaining that he can&#x27;t marry as many wives as he wants to. This is set against the backdrop of Martin Luther pinning his 95 Theses on the door of Wittenberg Cathedral, a paper that reads &quot;Eine Minuten bitte. Ich habe einen kleinen Problemo avec diese Religione.&quot; &quot;He was from everywhere,&quot; explains Izzard to great cheers from the audience. Similar to his use of Sean Connery as the voice of Henry VIII, he uses the voice of James Mason as the voice of God.

Izzard, a self-proclaimed film buff, also describes the plot of &quot;The Great Escape&quot; in a semi-improvised manner. He is particularly fond of Steve McQueen&#x27;s role in the film, and goes to great lengths to explain how inaccurate his escape through Central Europe actually is (&quot;within fifteen minutes he&#x27;s on the borders of Switzerland. This is from Poland! And if you don&#x27;t know the geography, it goes Poland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, Venezuela, Africa, Beirut, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and then Switzerland.&quot;).

Diversions are also made in relation to the Heimlich maneuver and the American Dream, while the performance ends with Izzard re-telling the story of how he didn&#x27;t lose his virginity. An encore is then performed, featuring Izzard delivering the plot of the film &quot;Speed&quot; in French and explaining how his schoolboy French, (&quot;la souris est sous la table, le chat est sur la chaise, et le singe est sur la branche&quot;) serves him in France itself.

One of Izzard&#x27;s most well-known routines was performed during &quot;Dress To Kill&quot;: a satirical depiction of Church of England fundamentalism, wherein Izzard explains how Church of England fundamentalism would be impossible because people would be shouting out &quot;You must have tea and cake with the vicar or you DIE!&quot; and &quot;CAKE OR DEATH?!&quot; The latter phrase has become so well known that it is now the name of an Eddie Izzard fansite and has inspired a Christian website called &quot;Anglican Memes&quot; for those who &quot;like gentle fun being poked at the church but are not interested in church-bashing or posting anything offensive.&quot;

<doc id="825945" wikidata="Q6045533" url="?curid=825945" title="Interbay, Seattle">
<text>Interbay is a neighborhood in northwestern Seattle, Washington. It consists of the valley between Queen Anne Hill on the east and Magnolia on the west, plus filled-in areas of Smith Cove and Salmon Bay. The neighborhood is bounded on the north by Salmon Bay, part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, across which is Ballard; on the south by what remains of Smith Cove, an inlet of Elliott Bay; on the east by 15th Avenue W. and Elliott Avenue W.; and on the west by the BNSF Railway. The Ballard Bridge crosses the ship canal from Interbay to Ballard.

Much of Interbay is taken up by BNSF Railway&#x27;s Balmer Yard. Interbay is also home to Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal on Salmon Bay and the Port of Seattle&#x27;s Piers 86, 90, and 91 on Smith Cove. Its main thoroughfares are Elliott Avenue W. (northwest- and southeast-bound) and 15th Avenue W. (north- and southbound).

==History==

It appears that the valley between Magnolia and Queen Anne was carved out during the Vashon Stade of the Fraser glaciation (roughly 14,000–17,000 years ago), A thin layer of sand throughout the area may date from a tsunami following an earthquake along the Seattle Fault Zone about 1,000 years ago.

Although Interbay fell within the traditional geographic range of the Duwamish, early ethnographers did not record contact-era or earlier Native American villages in the area. Nonetheless, University of Washington ethnologist T. T. Waterman lists several native place names at or near Smith Cove and Salmon Bay.

The Denny Party saw Interbay&#x27;s development potential when they explored the area in 1852, but chose to settle farther south. Their settlement became the core of Seattle. Meanwhile, most of Interbay came to be owned by Erasmus M. Smithers (1830–1905), later the founder of Renton, and Ohio-born physician and poet Henry A. Smith (1830–1915), after whom Smith&#x27;s Cove is now named. Smith and his wife, mother, and sister began with a claim on Salmon Bay near the present-day Ballard, and steadily acquired more land, extending their holdings south through Interbay to Smith Cove. In particular, the Smiths bought when so many other were selling during the 1855–56 Indian War (&quot;see Battle of Seattle&quot;).

Smith established a settlement known as Boulevard roughly halfway between Smith Cove and Salmon Bay, along a street he called Grand Boulevard (present-day West Dravus Street). He farmed, practiced medicine, and wrote. His most famous piece of writing, published in the 1880s, purported to be an English-language rendering of Chief Seattle&#x27;s speech on the occasion of an 1854 treaty conference; there is question about the authenticity of the translation.

In 1884 the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (SLSER) purchased all but of Smith&#x27;s in Interbay and built a north–south rail line through the area. The train stopped on Grand Boulevard near Gilman and Thorndyke Avenues, spurring further commercial development and the rise of a blue-collar village. In 1891, Seattle annexed Magnolia and Interbay, including Boulevard. By 1894, the post office name had been changed from &quot;Boulevard&quot; to &quot;Interbay&quot;, the name that has continued to this day.

The railway route through Interbay eventually came under the control of James J. Hill and the Great Northern Railway, as did much of at Smith Cove. Hill established a major depot and port at the cove, including Piers 38 and 39 (later renumbered 88 and 89)(now demolished), which were located east of present-day Piers 90 and 91. In 1896 Nippon Yusen Kaisha established the first regular steamship service between Asia and the Pacific Coast of North America, with Smith Cove as its American port.

During the 1911–1916 construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal along Salmon Bay, about of Smith Cove tidelands were filled with material from the dredging. The then (1911) new Port of Seattle built Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal on Salmon Bay at the north end of Interbay and bought the Great Northern docks and approximately at Smith&#x27;s Cove, where they developed two new coal and lumber piers, today&#x27;s Piers 90 and 91. These developments at either end of Interbay led to the increasing industrialization of the area.

This maritime trade spurred the rise of companies in Interbay including rope factory Portland Cordage, Rudd Paint Manufacturing, Berquist&#x27;s Vinegar Works, and the Chicago Junk Company (later Tsubota Steel and Pipe Company). Finns, Poles, Russians, Germans, Austrians, and Scots figured prominently among those who settled and worked in the neighborhood.

The Asian trade out of Smith Cove continued until 1934, when the violence there accompanying the Maritime Strike of 1934 led to a diversion of this trade to the Port of Los Angeles.

During the Great Depression, Interbay was the site of one of Seattle&#x27;s Hoovervilles.

From 1941 into the early 1970s, Smith Cove served as a supply depot for the United States Navy, before returning to use as a civilian port. A few buildings and warehouses can still be found on the site that trace back to that time, including Quarters A, also known as &quot;The Admiral&#x27;s House&quot;, perched on the SW corner of Magnolia and overlooking piers 90 and 91. The large white painted home is now in private ownership and used as an event space.

A proposed modern monorail would have run along 15th Ave NW, but the initiative collapsed in 2005 after eight years of contention. The D Line runs along 15th Ave W, from 2012 to present. A transit center for the new Expedia office complex was completed in 2019. The route of the Link expansion to Ballard will pass along the Interbay corridor.

==Bridging Interbay==

The southern part of Interbay was originally the Smith Cove tideflats. All of Interbay was divided from the 1880s onward by an increasing number of north–south railway lines. This motivated numerous bridges and trestles running east–west across the neighborhood. The first of these was at Grand Boulevard (now West Dravus Street). Around 1900 there was both a roadway and a trestle at Grand Boulevard for the Seattle-Fort Lawton street trolley line. The first of several bridges across Smith Cove at Garfield Street Bridge (site of the current Magnolia Bridge) was built some time between 1910 and 1912. The 23rd Avenue West trestle and the South Shore trestle were both western extensions of the West Garfield Street Bridge, leading to different points in Magnolia to the West. The Wheeler Street Bridge was a complex of four trestles. The Wheeler Street West trestle ran from 15th
Avenue West to Thorndyke Avenue West. The Lawton Way trestle intersected that at a diagonal and trestle extensions ran to both 20th Avenue West and Halliday Street on the Magnolia Bluffs.

As of 2008, besides the Magnolia Bridge over the former tideflats and the West Dravus trestle, Interbay is also spanned by a flyover from Nickerson Street at West Emerson Place, just south of Salmon Bay and the Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal, near the south end of the Ballard Bridge. There is no longer a crossing at Wheeler Street (just south of the Interbay Golf Course).

==Interbay today==

Interbay today remains home to BNSF Railway&#x27;s Balmer Yard and related locomotive maintenance shops, the Port of Seattle&#x27;s Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal on Salmon Bay and Piers 86, 90, and 91 on Smith Cove, and related facilities. It is also home to a Washington Army National Guard armory, Interbay Stadium, the Interbay P-Patch (a large community garden), and the Interbay Golf Course. Five late 19th century houses near Smith Cove, known as the Fourteenth Avenue West Group, have official status as a city landmark. There is a miscellany of light industrial, warehouse, wholesale, and retail businesses along 15th Avenue West, as well as a few professional offices and some housing. There continues to be a small shopping and dining neighborhood at West Dravus Street, the former Grand Boulevard. Near the Magnolia Bridge on 15th is the Center for Sex Positive Culture. A bicycle and foot trail comes north from the Central Waterfront by Belltown through Myrtle Edwards Park continues through the pier facilities around Smith Cove and parallels the railway tracks on their west through Interbay, ending on the west (Magnolia) side of the tracks on 20th Avenue West about three blocks south of Dravus. On April 2, 2015 Expedia, Inc. announced their purchase of the Amgen &quot;Helix&quot; facility along Elliot Ave. for $228.9m and their plans to move their corporate headquarters there from Bellevue, Washington by 2018.

<doc id="825959" wikidata="Q661379" url="?curid=825959" title="International Table Tennis Federation">
<text>The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) is the governing body for all national table tennis associations that use ITTF-approved sponge table tennis rackets. The role of the ITTF includes overseeing rules and regulations and seeking technological improvement for the sport of table tennis. The ITTF is responsible for the organization of numerous international competitions, including the World Table Tennis Championships.

==Founding history==
The ITTF was founded in 1926 by William Henry Lawes from Wymondham, the nine founding members being Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, British India, Sweden, and Wales. The first international tournament was held in January 1926 in Berlin, while the first World Table Tennis Championships was held in December 1926 in London.

Toward the end of 2000, the ITTF instituted several rules changes aimed at making table tennis more viable as a televised spectator sport. The older 38 mm balls were officially replaced by 40 mm balls. This increased the ball&#x27;s air resistance, and effectively slowed down the game. In 2003, the ITTF moved its headquarters from Hastings to Lausanne and set the ITTF Museum there.

In 2007, the governance for para table tennis was transferred from the International Paralympic Committee to the ITTF. In February 2008, the ITTF announced several rules changes after an ITTF Executive Meeting in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China with regards to a player&#x27;s eligibility to play for a new association. The new ruling was to encourage associations to develop their own players.

In 2019, the ITTF created its subsidiary World Table Tennis (WTT) to manage all its commercial and events business. The ITTF&#x27;s current headquarters are located in Lausanne while their Asia-Pacific office is based in Singapore and search for a new site for headquarters is in the process. The current president is Petra Sörling from Sweden. Sörling became the eighth person to hold the office in 2021.
==Membership==

The ITTF recognises five continental federations. There are currently 227 member associations within the ITTF.
==Organisational structure==
All member associations of the ITTF attend annual general meeting (AGM). Agendas on changes of the constitution, laws of table tennis, applications for membership etc. are discussed and finalised through votes. Also, the president of ITTF, 8 executive vice-presidents, and 32 or less continental representatives are elected at an AGM, serving for a four-year term. The president, executive vice-presidents, and the chairman of the athletes&#x27; commission compose executive committee.

The executive committee, continental representatives and presidents of the five continental federations or their appointees compose the board of directors (Board). The Board manages the work of the ITTF between AGMs. Several committees, commissions, working groups or panels work under the constitution of ITTF or under the Board.

==Role in diplomacy==
Unlike the organisations for more popular sports, the ITTF tends to recognise teams from generally unrecognised governing bodies for disputed territory. For example, it recognised the Table Tennis Federation of Kosovo in 2003 even though Kosovo was excluded from most other sports. It recognised the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1953 and allowed some basic diplomacy which lead to an opening for U.S. President Richard Nixon, called &quot;Ping Pong Diplomacy&quot;, in the early 1970s.

The ITTF also approved unified Korean team to compete at the World Table Tennis Championships in 1991 and 2018.

In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ITTF banned Russian and Belarusian players and officials from its competitions. But this reaction has slowed down in 30 March 2023, stated that Russian and Belarusian players will be re-allowed to participate ITTF and WTT competitions under strict conditions of neutrality, with government or state officials, and national symbols such as flags and anthems of both countries to continue being banned in ITTF-sanctioned events.

==Rules==

===Player eligibility===
For ITTF world title events, a player is eligible to play for his association by registering with the ITTF. If the player chooses to play for a new association, he shall register with the ITTF, through the new association. The player will be eligible to play for the new association after three, five, seven years after the date of registration, if the player is under the age of 15, 18, 21 respectively. The player will be eligible to play for the new association after nine years if the player is at least 21 years old.

===Service and point system===
The table tennis point system was reduced from a 21 to an 11-point scoring system in 2001. A game shall be won by the player or pair first scoring 11 points unless both players or pairs score 10 points, when the game shall be won by the first player or pair subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. This was intended to make games more fast-paced and exciting. The ITTF also changed the rules on service to prevent a player from hiding the ball during service, in order to increase the average length of rallies and to reduce the server&#x27;s advantage. Today, the game changes from time to time mainly to improve on the excitement for television viewers.

===Speed glue ban===
In 2007, ITTF&#x27;s board of directors in Zagreb decided to implement the VOC-free glue rule at Junior events, starting from 1 January 2008, as a transitional period before the full implementation of the VOC ban on 1 September 2008.

As of 1 January 2009, all speed glue was to have been banned.

==ITTF tournaments==

The ITTF and its subsidiary WTT hold international tournaments and the ITTF maintains official world ranking lists based on players&#x27; results in tournaments throughout the year.

Conventions: MT/WT: men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s team; MS/WS: men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s singles; MD/WD: men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s doubles; XD: mixed doubles
;Major international events
;Junior events
;Para events
==Ranking method==
;Singles

==ITTF Museum==
The ITTF Museum was previously in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the ITTF is based. The ITTF decided in 2014 to move the museum to Shanghai, China, which was planning the China Table Tennis Museum around the same time. The new museum was designated in the same building with the China Table Tennis Museum on different floors, managed and operated by Shanghai University of Sport, and officially opened in 2018.

<doc id="825964" wikidata="Q412270" url="?curid=825964" title="Ethyl butyrate">
<text>Ethyl butyrate, also known as ethyl butanoate, or butyric ether, is an ester with the chemical formula CH3CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. It is soluble in propylene glycol, paraffin oil, and kerosene. It has a fruity odor, similar to pineapple, and is a key ingredient used as a flavor enhancer in processed orange juices. It also occurs naturally in many fruits, albeit at lower concentrations.

==Uses==
It is commonly used as artificial flavoring resembling orange juice and is hence used in nearly all orange juices sold in the US, including those sold as &quot;fresh&quot; or “concentrated&quot;. It is also used in alcoholic beverages (e.g. martinis, daiquiris etc.), as a solvent in perfumery products, and as a plasticizer for cellulose.

Ethyl butyrate is one of the most common chemicals used in flavors and fragrances. It can be used in a variety of flavors: orange (most common), cherry, pineapple, mango, guava, bubblegum, peach, apricot, fig, and plum. Ethyl butyrate is synthesised in Jamaican rum upon the estrification of butyric acid from muck and ethanol during the distillation process. This gives Jamaican rum its pleasant flavour. In industrial use, it is also one of the cheapest chemicals, which only adds to its popularity.

==Production==
It can be synthesized by reacting ethanol and butyric acid. This is a condensation reaction, meaning water is produced in the reaction as a byproduct. Ethyl butyrate from natural sources can be distinguished from synthetic ethyl butyrate by Stable Isotope Ratio Analysis (SIRA).

<doc id="825965" wikidata="Q6644403" url="?curid=825965" title="List of universities in Venezuela">
<text>Venezuela has a wide array of universities, offering courses in a broad variety of subjects, spread between a total 23 public and 24 private universities located across several states. As a result of a Royal Decree signed by Philip V of Spain, the Central University of Venezuela—the country&#x27;s oldest—was founded in 1721 as &quot;Universidad Real y Pontificia de Caracas&quot;. The campus was originally at the now-known &quot;Palacio de las Academias&quot; but, in 1944, president Isaías Medina Angarita relocated it to the University City of Caracas.

The second oldest university is the University of the Andes. Established in 1810 as the &quot;Real Universidad de San Buenaventura de Mérida de los Caballeros&quot;, its origins date back to 1785 when Fray founded a priest school in the city of Mérida. The University of Zulia—the third-oldest university—was founded in 1891 when the Federal College of Maracaibo was converted into a university. The government ordered the closure of the university for political reasons in 1904, and it remained closed until 1946. The University of Carabobo is the last to be founded before the twentieth century by being established in 1892 and dating back to 1833 when the College of Carabobo was created by presidential decree.

The first private university established in the country was the Andres Bello Catholic University, founded in 1953 as the &quot;Catholic University of Venezuela&quot; under the government of Marcos Pérez Jiménez. The development of the Nueva Esparta University begun when the Nueva Esparta College was established in 1954. After major improvements over the structure, the university was formally re-appointed under its current name. Originally designed as an extension of the Andres Bello Catholic University in 1962, the Catholic University of Táchira was established as an autonomic university in 1982, becoming the second catholic university in the country. The Metropolitan University&#x27;s foundation dates back to 1960, when entrepreneur Eugenio Mendoza led a civil group to develop an institution &quot;skilled to capacitate, with modern criteria, young students from all social classes.&quot; The university was finally established in 1970.

She played Lizbeth Bachman, a sophisticated heiress torn between playboy Jordy Clegg and handicapped doctor Thomas McCandless. Walker played the role from the show&#x27;s launch until she left in 1984.

She returned to daytime as mob princess Olivia St. John on &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1988 to 1990, playing a villainess complicating the lives of Duke Lavery and his family. Walker would make a brief return to this role in 2017.

She made additional appearances as Alex on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in August 2007 for the show&#x27;s 9,999th and 10,000th episodes, Her character later returned again on November 2, 2007 for a brief run and again on January 2, 2009, March 15, 2011 and November 17, 2011.

<text>A recreation room (also known as a rec room, rumpus room, play room, playroom, games room, or ruckus room) is a room used for a variety of purposes, such as parties, games and other everyday or casual activities. The term &quot;recreation room&quot; is most prevalent in the United States, while &quot;rumpus room&quot; is more common in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. In the United Kingdom, the most common term is &quot;games room&quot;, or sometimes &quot;den&quot;. Some, however, will have a room specific to one particular game or entertainment unit often found in a recreation room, or some have a &quot;snug&quot;, which is a smaller cosy room for watching films and playing video games. Often children and teenagers entertain their friends in their home&#x27;s recreation room, which is often located in the basement, away from the main living areas of the house. Usually it is a larger space than a living room, enabling the area to serve multiple purposes and entertain moderately large groups.

== Contents ==
Recreation rooms can have many themes and contents, depending on their intended use.

=== Entertainment ===
Recreation rooms are normally centered on some form of entertainment, typically an audio/video setup. This can consist of something as elaborate as a projection screen with surround sound or something as simple as a base model television.

=== Seating ===
Couches, pub tables/chairs, bar stools, bean bag chairs, and recliners may all be used in recreation rooms.

=== Games ===
Tabletop games are frequent in recreation rooms. In addition to games played on a normal table, recreation rooms sometimes include custom game tables for table tennis (ping pong), table football (foosball), table shuffleboard, air hockey, or billiards (pool). Custom tables for casino games such as poker, blackjack, and craps are also common. Other games include dart boards and arcade games such as pinball and video games. More substantial game rooms may have mini bowling lanes, indoor golf simulators, and other specialty amenities.

=== Food and drink ===
Refrigerators, microwave ovens, wet bars, popcorn makers, ice cream makers, and soda fountains can sometimes be found in recreation rooms.

<text>In Western architecture, a living room, also called a lounge room (Australian English), lounge (British English), sitting room (British English), or drawing room, is a room for relaxing and socializing in a residential house or apartment. Such a room is sometimes called a front room when it is near the main entrance at the front of the house. In large, formal homes, a sitting room is often a small private living area adjacent to a bedroom, such as the Queens&#x27; Sitting Room and the Lincoln Sitting Room of the White House.

In the late 19th or early 20th century, Edward Bok advocated using the term &quot;living room&quot; for the room then commonly called a &quot;parlo[u]r&quot; or &quot;drawing room&quot;, and is sometimes erroneously credited with inventing the term. It is now a term used more frequently when referring to a space to relax and unwind within a household. Within different parts of the world, living rooms are designed differently and evolving, but all share the same purpose, to gather users in a comfortable space.

== Overview ==
In homes that lack a parlour or family room, the living room may also function as a drawing room for guests. Objects in living rooms may be used &quot;to instigate and mediate contemplation about significant others, as well as to regulate the amount of intimacy desired with guests.&quot;

A typical Western living room may contain furnishings such as a couch, chairs, occasional tables, coffee tables, bookshelves, televisions, electric lamps, rugs, or other furniture. Depending on climate, sitting rooms would traditionally contain a fireplace, dating from when this was necessary for heating. In a Japanese sitting room, called a &quot;washitsu&quot;, the floor is covered with tatami, sectioned mats, on which people can sit comfortably. They also typically consist of shoji, fusuma, and ramas which allow for the space to be very minimalistic and cohesive. Japanese living room design concepts contradicted UK and New Zealand ideals in the way that Japanese culture believed in warming the person, instead of the home. This consisted of owning a portable hibachi for cooking needs rather than heating needs, meanwhile people in the UK and New Zealand used fireplaces to warm the space and not for cooking needs. Japanese cultural belief systems affected their design characteristics in the way that ornamentation should be minimal while incorporating natural elements.


== From parlour room to living room ==
Until the late 19th century, the front parlour was the room in the house used for formal social events, including where the recent deceased were laid out before their funeral. This room had only traditionally been used on Sundays or for formal occasions such as the ceremonies of deceased family members before proper burial; it was the buffer zone between the public and private area within the house. Sundays are now more typically used for watching football on large color televisions causing larger family rooms to become more popular during the 1970s. The term &quot;living room&quot; is found initially in the decorating literature of the 1890s, where a living room is understood to be a reflection of the personality of the designer, rather than the Victorian conventions of the day. Only the wealthy were able to afford several rooms within a space such as parlors, libraries, drawing rooms, and smoking rooms.

The change in terminology is credited to Edward Bok due to his accreditation of the magazine article, Ladies&#x27; Home Journal. The article was specifically targeted to women and provided them with reliance of popular content in relation to home design at an affordable price and Bok&#x27;s vision of the ideal American household and the roles of the women. Bok strongly believed that the space should be &quot;lived in&quot; rather than having an expensively furnished room that was rarely used within the household. He had promoted the new name to encourage people to use the room in their daily lives as a gathering space.

== Evolution of the modern living room idea==
Interior designers and architects throughout time have continuously studied users within a space to design to best fit their needs and wants. King of France, Louis XIV’s Palace of Versailles can be considered having one of the most lavishly decorated living rooms in the late 1600s. During King Louis XIV&#x27;s reign, the architectural Louis XIV style or &quot;Louis Quatorze&quot; was established. This style can also be identified as the French Classicism and had an influence on other countries. It included the bold use of marble and bronze materials. Louis XIV worked alongside Louis Le Vau and Augustin-Charles d’Aviler to design &quot;appartments de parade,&quot; otherwise known as formal rooms that usually consisted of discussing and conducting business matters. They also designed, &quot;appartements de commodité,&quot; which were rooms that the homeowners could relax and lounge in. This style, known as the Louis XV style, or &quot;Louis Quinze&quot;, was designed intentionally to combine formality with a new level of comfort. Charles Étienne Briseux, French architect whose architectural style was prominently Louis Quinze, published &quot;Architecture moderne ou L’art de bien bâtir&quot; in 1728, introduced comfort which later became an obsession to have specific materiality and furnishings within the interior of a space. Its influenced began in Paris, France, and then quickly spread across Europe reaching the attention of the wealthy and lavish.

The Industrial Revolution emerged in the late 1700s which completely shifted America from an artisan and handmade process to a society that was dominated by a machine manufacturing industry. This allowed the production of chairs, tables, light bulbs, telegraphs, and radios that allowed society to purchase at a reasonable price to add into their home. The rise of the Industrial Revolution played a huge role in the advancement of the living room because due to mass production, decorative items became more available to the middle class.

An example of this evolution is the Miller House designed by Eero Saarinen. Saarinen knew that he wanted to design a living room not only with an appropriate architectural style but to feature &quot;conversation pit&quot; that sunk users to the ground making them feel a bit more &quot;grounded.&quot; It encouraged relaxation and conversing which the Miller House was one of the first spaces to celebrate and introduce the conversation pit. The Miller House&#x27;s architectural style was known as Mid-century modern, this indicated that it was introduced after World War II between 1945 and 1960. The movement was associated with minimal ornamentation, simplicity, honest materials, and craftsmanship.

==Casting==
Selma Diamond died from lung cancer after the second season. Florence Halop was hired to replace Diamond as the new bailiff, but she was also a heavy smoker and similarly developed lung cancer and died after she completed filming season three. She was replaced by Marsha Warfield, who played bailiff Roz Russell until the series ended in 1992.

In 1984, Shelley Hack was hired to replace Paula Kelly and portray new public defender Christine Sullivan—who was going to be romantically involved with Judge Harry Stone (Harry Anderson). But during rehearsals, Hack and producer Reinhold Weege realized there was a problem. &quot;What happened was the role was changed, Instead of being a funny lady, as she was in the reading, they had changed her into a straight woman. It wasn&#x27;t working, The concept just didn&#x27;t work and that&#x27;s what I told them...What&#x27;s the point if it&#x27;s not working?&quot; Hack and the producer mutually and amicably agreed she would not continue with the series.  Ellen Foley was brought in for season two as a new character, public defender Billie Young. For episode 2 of season 2 (as a guest, in what was meant to be the season 2 premiere)–and from season 3 onwards (as a regular cast member)—Markie Post was hired to portray Christine Sullivan.

==Theme music==
Every episode of &quot;Night Court&quot; opens (after a cold open) and closes with a jazz-influenced, bass-heavy theme tune composed by Jack Elliott, featuring Ernie Watts on saxophone while featuring video footage of prominent New York City landmarks such as the Brooklyn Bridge and the New York County Courthouse.

&quot;Night Court&quot;″s theme was used in the season-5 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Bill &amp; Peter&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;, featuring animations of former US President Bill Clinton playing saxophone along with Secret Service musicians playing backup.

&quot;Night Court&quot;″s theme was sampled for the remix to Cam&#x27;Ron&#x27;s 1998 single &quot;Horse &amp; Carriage&quot;. It was produced by Darrell &quot;Digga&quot; Branch and featured Big Pun, Charli Baltimore, Wyclef Jean, and Silkk the Shocker.

Following the end credits theme music, a distinctive laugh can be heard dubbed over the vanity logo displaying producer Reinhold Weege&#x27;s &quot;Starry Night Productions&quot;. This same laugh can be heard coming from the studio audience throughout numerous seasons of &quot;Night Court&quot;. At first it was thought to be the canned laugh of voice actor Mel Blanc or even star Harry Anderson; but in fact, it was the laugh of Chuck Weege, Reinhold&#x27;s father, who attended nearly all of the tapings in person (until Reinhold left the show after the sixth season).

==Episodes==

Special releases

The &quot;Television Favorites&quot; compilation DVD included the pilot episode, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;; both parts of the fourth-season finale, &quot;Her Honor&quot;; the fifth-season episodes &quot;Death of a Bailiff&quot; and &quot;Who Was That Mashed Man?&quot;; and the sixth-season episode &quot;Fire&quot;, which marked the beginning of Harry&#x27;s relationship with Christine.

Harry Anderson, Markie Post, and Charles Robinson appeared in the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episode, &quot;The One with the Cast of Night Court&quot;. John Larroquette is also mentioned; Harry says he had just spoken to John, which annoys Markie (who has not had recent contact with her absent former co-star) and begins an argument between them that lasts for most of the story.

<text>In planetary geology, an albedo feature is a large area on the surface of a planet (or other Solar System body) which shows a contrast in brightness or darkness (albedo) with adjacent areas.

Historically, albedo features were the first (and usually only) features to be seen and named on Mars and Mercury. Early classical maps (such as those of Schiaparelli and Antoniadi) showed only albedo features, and it was not until the arrival of space probes that other surface features such as craters could be seen.

On bodies other than Mars and Mercury, an albedo feature is sometimes called a regio.

On bodies with a very thick atmosphere like Venus or Titan, permanent albedo features cannot be seen using ordinary optical telescopes because the surface is not visible, and only clouds and other transient atmospheric phenomena are seen. The &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; probe observed multiple albedo features on Titan after its arrival in Saturn&#x27;s orbit in 2004.

The first albedo feature ever seen on another planet was Syrtis Major Planum on Mars in the 17th century.

Today, thanks to space probes, very high-resolution images of surface features on Mars and Mercury are available, and the classical nomenclature based on albedo features has fallen somewhat into disuse, although it is still used for Earth-based observing of Mars by amateur astronomers.

However, for some Solar System bodies (such as Pluto prior to the &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission), the best available images show only albedo features. These images were usually taken by the Hubble Space Telescope or by ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics.

Cydonia Mensae on Mars is an example of an albedo feature.

<doc id="826003" wikidata="Q5421561" url="?curid=826003" title="Export of cryptography from the United States">
<text>The export of cryptography from the United States to other countries has experienced various levels of restrictions over time. World War II illustrated that code-breaking and cryptography can play an integral part in national security and the ability to prosecute war. Changes in technology and the preservation of free speech have been competing factors in the regulation and constraint of cryptographic technologies for export.

==History==
===Cold War era===
In the early days of the Cold War, the U.S. and its allies developed an elaborate series of export control regulations designed to prevent a wide range of Western technology from falling into the hands of others, particularly the Eastern bloc. All export of technology classed as &#x27;critical&#x27; required a license. CoCom was organized to coordinate Western export controls.

Two types of technology were protected: technology associated only with weapons of war (&quot;munitions&quot;) and dual use technology, which also had commercial applications. In the U.S., dual use technology export was controlled by the Department of Commerce, while munitions were controlled by the State Department. Since in the immediate post WWII period the market for cryptography was almost entirely military, the encryption technology (techniques as well as equipment and, after computers began to play a larger role in modern life, crypto software) was included as &quot;Category XI - Miscellaneous Articles&quot; and later &quot;Category XIII - Auxiliary Military Equipment&quot; item into the United States Munitions List on November 17, 1954. The multinational control of the export of cryptography on the Western side of the cold war divide was done via the mechanisms of CoCom.

By the 1960s, however, financial organizations were beginning to require strong commercial encryption on the rapidly growing field of wired money transfer. The U.S. Government&#x27;s introduction of the Data Encryption Standard in 1975 meant that commercial uses of high quality encryption would become common, and serious problems of export control began to arise. Generally these were dealt with through case-by-case export license request proceedings brought by computer manufacturers, such as IBM, and by their large corporate customers.

===PC era===

Encryption export controls became a matter of public concern with the introduction of the personal computer. Phil Zimmermann&#x27;s PGP encryption software and its distribution on the Internet in 1991 was the first major &#x27;individual level&#x27; challenge to controls on export of cryptography. The growth of electronic commerce in the 1990s created additional pressure for reduced restrictions. VideoCipher II also used DES to scramble satellite TV audio.

In 1989, non-encryption use of cryptography (such as access control and message authentication) was removed from export control with a Commodity Jurisdiction. In 1992, an exception was formally added in the USML for non-encryption use of cryptography (and satellite TV descramblers) and a deal between NSA and the Software Publishers Association made 40-bit RC2 and RC4 encryption easily exportable using a Commodity Jurisdiction with special &quot;7-day&quot; and &quot;15-day&quot; review processes (which transferred control from the State Department to the Commerce Department). At this stage Western governments had, in practice, a split personality when it came to encryption; policy was made by the military cryptanalysts, who were solely concerned with preventing their &#x27;enemies&#x27; acquiring secrets, but that policy was then communicated to commerce by officials whose job was to support industry.

Shortly afterward, Netscape&#x27;s SSL technology was widely adopted as a method for protecting credit card transactions using public key cryptography. Netscape developed two versions of its web browser. The &quot;U.S. edition&quot; supported full size (typically 1024-bit or larger) RSA public keys in combination with full size symmetric keys (secret keys) (128-bit RC4 or 3DES in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0). The &quot;International Edition&quot; had its effective key lengths reduced to 512 bits and 40 bits respectively (&quot;RSA_EXPORT&quot; with 40-bit RC2 or RC4 in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0). Acquiring the &#x27;U.S. domestic&#x27; version turned out to be sufficient hassle that most computer users, even in the U.S., ended up with the &#x27;International&#x27; version, whose weak 40-bit encryption can currently be broken in a matter of days using a single computer. A similar situation occurred with Lotus Notes for the same reasons.

Legal challenges by Peter Junger and other civil libertarians and privacy advocates, the widespread availability of encryption software outside the U.S., and the perception by many companies that adverse publicity about weak encryption was limiting their sales and the growth of e-commerce, led to a series of relaxations in US export controls, culminating in 1996 in President Bill Clinton signing the Executive Order 13026 transferring the commercial encryption from the Munition List to the Commerce Control List. Furthermore, the order stated that, &quot;the software shall not be considered or treated as &#x27;technology&#x27;&quot; in the sense of Export Administration Regulations. The Commodity Jurisdiction process was replaced with a Commodity Classification process, and a provision was added to allow export of 56-bit encryption if the exporter promised to add &quot;key recovery&quot; backdoors by the end of 1998. In 1999, the EAR was changed to allow 56-bit encryption (based on RC2, RC4, RC5, DES or CAST) and 1024-bit RSA to be exported without any backdoors, and new SSL cipher suites were introduced to support this (&quot;RSA_EXPORT1024&quot; with 56-bit RC4 or DES). In 2000, the Department of Commerce implemented rules that greatly simplified the export of commercial and open source software containing cryptography, including allowing the key length restrictions to be removed after going through the Commodity Classification process (to classify the software as &quot;retail&quot;) and adding an exception for publicly available encryption source code.

===Current status===
, non-military cryptography exports from the U.S. are controlled by the Department of Commerce&#x27;s Bureau of Industry and Security. Some restrictions still exist, even for mass market products; particularly with regards to export to &quot;rogue states&quot; and terrorist organizations. Militarized encryption equipment, TEMPEST-approved electronics, custom cryptographic software, and even cryptographic consulting services still require an export license. Furthermore, encryption registration with the BIS is required for the export of &quot;mass market encryption commodities, software and components with encryption exceeding 64 bits&quot; (). For elliptic curves algorithms and asymmetric algorithms, the requirements for key length are 128 bit and 768 bits, respectively. In addition, other items require a one-time review by, or notification to, BIS prior to export to most countries. For instance, the BIS must be notified before open-source cryptographic software is made publicly available on the Internet, though no review is required. Export regulations have been relaxed from pre-1996 standards, but are still complex. Other countries, notably those participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement, have similar restrictions. On March 29, 2021, the Implementation of Wassenaar Arrangement 2019 Plenary Decisions was published in the Federal Register. This rule included changes to license exception ENC Section 740.17 of the EAR

==U.S. export rules==
U.S. non-military exports are controlled by Export Administration Regulations (EAR), a short name for the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 15 chapter VII, subchapter C.

Encryption items specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted or modified for military
applications (including command, control and intelligence applications) are controlled by
the Department of State on the United States Munitions List.

===Terminology===
Encryption export terminology is defined in EAR part 772.1. In particular:

* &quot;Encryption Component&quot; is an encryption commodity or software (but not the source code), including encryption chips, integrated circuits etc.
* &quot;Encryption items&quot; include non-military encryption commodities, software, and technology.
* &quot;Open cryptographic interface&quot; is a mechanism which is designed to allow a customer or other party to insert cryptographic functionality without the intervention, help or assistance of the manufacturer or its agents.
* &quot;Ancillary cryptography&quot; items are the ones primarily used not for computing and communications, but for digital rights management; games, household appliances; printing, photo and video recording (but not videoconferencing); business process automation; industrial or manufacturing systems (including robotics, fire alarms and HVAC); automotive, aviation and other transportation systems.

Export destinations are classified by the EAR Supplement No. 1 to Part 740 into four &quot;country groups&quot; (A, B, D, E) with further subdivisions; a country can belong to more than one group. For the purposes of encryption, groups B, D:1, and E:1 are important:

* B is a large list of countries that are subject to relaxed encryption export rules
* D:1 is a short list of countries that are subject to stricter export control. Notable countries on this list include China and Russia.
* E:1 is a very short list of &quot;terrorist-supporting&quot; countries (as of 2009, includes five countries (Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria); previously contained six countries and was also called &quot;terrorist 6&quot; or T-6)

The EAR Supplement No. 1 to Part 738 (Commerce Country Chart) contains the table with &quot;country restrictions&quot;. If a line of table that corresponds to the country contains an X in the &quot;reason for control&quot; column, the export of a controlled item requires a license, unless an &quot;exception&quot; can be applied. For the purposes of encryption, the following three reasons for control are important:

* NS1 National Security Column 1
* AT1 Anti-Terrorism Column 1
* EI Encryption Items is currently same as NS1

===Classification===
For export purposes each item is classified with the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) with the help of the Commerce Control List (CCL, Supplement No. 1 to the EAR part 774). In particular:

* 5A002 Systems, equipment, electronic assemblies, and integrated circuits for &quot;information security. Reasons for Control: NS1, AT1.
* 5A992 &quot;Mass market&quot; encryption commodities and other equipment not controlled by 5A002. Reason for Control: AT1.
* 5B002 Equipment for development or production of items classified as 5A002, 5B002, 5D002 or 5E002. Reasons for Control: NS1, AT1.
* 5D002 Encryption software. Reasons for control: NS1, AT1.
** used to develop, produce, or use items classified as 5A002, 5B002, 5D002
** supporting technology controlled by 5E002
** modeling the functions of equipment controlled by 5A002 or 5B002
** used to certify software controlled by 5D002
* 5D992 Encryption software not controlled by 5D002. Reasons for control: AT1.
* 5E002 Technology for the development, production or use of equipment controlled by 5A002 or 5B002 or software controlled by 5D002. Reasons for control: NS1, AT1.
* 5E992 Technology for the 5x992 items. Reasons for control: AT1.

An item can be either self-classified, or a classification (&quot;review&quot;) requested from the BIS. A BIS review is required for typical items to get the 5A992 or 5D992 classification.

<text>Frederick John Miller (November 24, 1824 – May 11, 1888) was a brewery owner in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He founded the Miller Brewing Company at the Plank Road Brewery, purchased in 1855. He learned the brewing business in Germany at Sigmaringen.

He was born &quot;Friedrich Johannes Miller&quot; in Riedlingen in the Kingdom of Württemberg. Some German records, like the one about the baptism of his first son Joseph Eduard, also state the name as Müller. Since the end of the 20th century, some publications state Miller&#x27;s name as &quot;Frederick Edward John Miller&quot; from which they derive the birth name &quot;Friedrich Eduard Johann(es) Müller&quot;.

Miller married Josephine Müller in Friedrichshafen, Württemberg, on June 7, 1853. Their first child, Joseph Edward Miller, was born the next year. In 1854, the family emigrated to the United States, spending the first year in New York. They moved to Wisconsin in 1855, arriving through New Orleans.

Josephine died in April 1860 and Miller married Lisette Gross and had five children who survived infancy: Ernst, Emil, Frederick II, Clara, and Elise. Clara married Carl A. Miller (no relation), also a German immigrant.

Frederick Miller once owned a tract of land in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan that is now Craig Lake State Park.

Miller died of cancer in 1888 at age 63, and was buried in the Calvary Cemetery in Milwaukee. Following his death, the company was run by his surviving three sons and son-in-law Carl.

Miller&#x27;s younger daughter Elise was the mother of Harry G. John (1919–1992), president of the company from 1946 to 1947 and founder of the De Rance Corporation, once the world&#x27;s largest Catholic charity.

Older daughter Clara&#x27;s son Frederick C. Miller (1906–1954) was an All-American college football player at Notre Dame under Knute Rockne and became president of the company after John in 1947. He and his 20-year-old son Fred, Jr., were killed in a plane crash in Milwaukee in 1954. The nine-passenger twin-engine company aircraft was a converted Lockheed Ventura. It was bound for Winnipeg for a December hunting trip at Portage la Prairie; the crash also killed the two company pilots, brothers Joseph and Paul Laird.

<text>Pangaea Proxima (also called Pangaea Ultima, Neopangaea, and Pangaea II) is a possible future supercontinent configuration. Consistent with the supercontinent cycle, Pangaea Proxima could form within the next 250 million years. This potential configuration, hypothesized by Christopher Scotese in November 1982, earned its name from its similarity to the previous Pangaea supercontinent. Scotese later changed Pangaea Ultima (Last Pangaea) to Pangaea Proxima (Next Pangaea) to alleviate confusion about the name Pangaea Ultima which could imply that it would be the last supercontinent. The concept was suggested by extrapolating past cycles of formation and breakup of supercontinents, not on theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of tectonic change, which are too imprecise to project that far into the future. &quot;It&#x27;s all pretty much fantasy to start with,&quot; Scotese has said. &quot;But it&#x27;s a fun exercise to think about what might happen. And you can only do it if you have a really clear idea of why things happen in the first place.&quot; 

Supercontinents describe the merger of all, or nearly all, of Earth&#x27;s landmass into a single contiguous continent. In the Pangaea Proxima scenario, subduction at the western Atlantic, east of the Americas, leads to the subduction of the Atlantic mid-ocean ridge followed by subduction destroying the Atlantic and Indian basin, causing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to close, bringing the Americas back together with Africa and Europe. As with most supercontinents, the interior areas of Pangaea Proxima are presumed to become humid, semi-arid deserts that will be prone to extreme temperatures up to 55°C. Most land mammals, including humans&#x27; descendants, may be driven to extinction (comparable to the Permian–Triassic extinction event) because of these environments.

==Formation==
According to the Pangaea Proxima hypothesis, the Atlantic and Indian Oceans will continue to get wider until new subduction zones bring the continents back together, forming a future Pangaea. Most continents and microcontinents are predicted to collide with Eurasia, just as they did when most continents collided with Laurentia.

In the next 50 million years (assuming no new subduction zones come into being before then), North America is predicted to shift west and Eurasia east, and possibly even to the south, bringing Great Britain closer to the North Pole and Siberia southward towards warm, subtropical latitudes. Africa is predicted to collide with Europe and Arabia, closing the Mediterranean Sea (thus completely closing the Tethys Ocean (or Neotethys)) and the Red Sea between Sudan and Saudi Arabia while the Persian Gulf will be closed off resulting in Iran to become a landlocked country. A long mountain range (the Mediterranean Mountain Range) would then extend from Iberia, across Southern Europe and into Asia. Some are even predicted to have peaks higher than Mount Everest between Spain, Greece, Italy, and Egypt. Similarly, Australia is predicted to beach itself past the doorstep of Southeast Asia, causing islands such as the Philippines and Indonesia to be compressed inland, forming another potential mountain range while Japan will collide with China, Korea, and Russia. Meanwhile, Southern and Baja California are predicted to have already collided with Alaska with new mountain ranges formed between the United States and Canada.

About 125 million years from now, the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to stop widening and begin to shrink as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge seafloor spreading gives way to subduction. In this scenario, the mid-ocean ridge between South America and Africa will probably be subducted first; the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to narrow as a result of subduction beneath the Americas. The Indian Ocean is also predicted to be smaller due to northward subduction of oceanic crust into the Central Indian trench. Antarctica is expected to split in two and shift northwards, colliding with Madagascar and Australia, enclosing a remnant of the Indian Ocean, which Scotese calls the &quot;Medi-Pangaean Sea&quot;.

When the last of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is subducted beneath the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to close rapidly. Research by Duarte &quot;et al&quot; in 2024 is consistent with this, noting that the Gibraltar Arc may evolve into a subduction zone entering the Atlantic Ocean and forming an Atlantic analogue to the current Ring of Fire, leading to the closure of the Atlantic Ocean.

At 250 million years in the future, the Atlantic is predicted to have closed, with only small vestiges of the former ocean remaining. North America will have collided with Africa, but be in a more southerly position than where it rifted away. South America is predicted to be wrapped around the southern tip of Africa and Antarctica, completely enclosing the Medi-Pangaean Sea, which will become a supertoxic inland sea that begins to poison the surrounding oceans, lands and atmosphere, leading to another great extinction event. The supercontinent will be encircled by a global ocean, the Neopanthalassan Ocean (meaning &quot;new&quot; Panthalassan Ocean), which encircles half the Earth. The Earth is expected to have a hothouse climate with an average global temperature of . The only areas likely to be habitable for land mammals are those closest to the poles.

== Effects ==
The formation of Pangaea Proxima will probably dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. The sea level may drop because of increased glaciation. The rate of surface weathering may rise, increasing the rate at which organic material is buried. Pangaea Proxima also has the potential to lower global temperatures and increase atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering global temperatures. These changes as described above can result in more rapid biological evolution as new niches emerge. It has been suggested that the rise in &quot;p&quot;CO2 and the increased continentality that would accompany the assembly of Pangaea Proxima will result in climatic extremes intense enough to bring about the mass extinction of mammals.

Pangaea Proxima could also insulate the mantle. The flow of heat will be concentrated, resulting in volcanism and the flooding of large areas with basalt. Rifts will form and Pangaea Proxima will split up once more in 400 to 500 million years. Earth may thereafter experience a warming period as occurred during the Cretaceous period, which marked the split-up of the previous Pangaea supercontinent.

== Models ==
There are two models for the formation of Pangaea Proxima — an early model and the current model. The two models differ in where they place Australia, Antarctica, and Chukotka.

The early model, created in 1982 and shown on the Paleomap Project website, places Australia and Antarctica connected to each other as a separate landmass to Pangaea Proxima, close to the South Pole, and Chukotka staying with Eurasia.

The current model, created in 2001 and shown on Christopher Scotese&#x27;s YouTube channel, has Australia attached to China, East Antarctica attached to South America, and West Antarctica attached to Australia, with Chukotka and the Kamchatka Peninsula attached to North America (Chukotka is on the North American plate; while the Kamchatka Peninsula could either lie on the North American plate or be part of a separate Okhotsk microplate).

==Other suggested future supercontinents==
Paleogeologist Ronald Blakey has described predictions of the next 15 to 85 million years of tectonic development as fairly settled, without supercontinent formation. Beyond that, he cautions that the geologic record is full of unexpected shifts in tectonic activity driven by currents deep in the Earth&#x27;s mantle which are largely undetectable and poorly understood, making longer projections &quot;very, very speculative&quot;. In addition to Pangaea Proxima, two other hypothetical supercontinents—&quot;Amasia&quot; and &quot;Novopangaea&quot;—were illustrated in an October 2007 &quot;New Scientist&quot; article. Another supercontinent, Aurica, has been suggested in an article published in 2016.

Research from Curtin University in Australia and Peking University in China published in 2022 supports an Amasia scenario within 200 to 300 million years. The study in the National Science Review suggests that the Pacific Ocean, shrinking since the time of the dinosaurs, may continue until it has closed entirely, resulting in the collision of the Americas with Eurasia.

<text>Noir is a science fiction novel by K. W. Jeter, published in 1998. It uses the conventions of film noir – the alienated, doomed hero, the cynical private detective, the femme fatale, universal corruption and moral breakdown – to portray a dystopian vision of capitalism run riot.

Even the monochrome visual style of &quot;film noir&quot; is a factor in &quot;Noir&quot;, as the hero has had his eyes specially treated to show the world as a black-and-white movie, altering his perception of people and objects around him so they fit into the aesthetic. The hero is a detective named McNihil who is hired by corporate executives ostensibly to investigate the death of one of their colleagues.

The book is set in the Pacific Fringe – the only remaining industrialised part of the world – in a society where free market capitalism holds absolute sway. Even the dead, including the hero&#x27;s wife, can be brought back to life as slave labour if they fail to meet their financial obligations. The internet has evolved radically so that emails can be seen fluttering around the recipient and pestering for attention, while strange online sexual experiences can be had through electronic surrogates called prowlers.

<doc id="826033" wikidata="Q4881225" url="?curid=826033" title="Beijing–Zhangjiakou Expressway">
<text>The Jingzhang Expressway () is a expressway in China connecting Beijing and Zhangjiakou. Construction began in 1998 and finished November 16, 2002. The expressway&#x27;s name comes from the combination of one-character Chinese abbreviations for Beijing and Zhangjiakou (Beijing—Jing, Zhangjiakou—Zhang).

It is a part of the Jingda Expressway from central Beijing to Datong, in Shanxi province, which was built to reduce traffic on the increasingly congested China National Highway 110, which runs from Beijing to Qingtongxia.

The Jingzhang Expressway has shortened the driving time between Beijing and Zhangjiakou from over three hours to two hours. Its construction is a part of broader goals to improve the road network structure in Hebei Province, stimulate the economy along the route, and promote the economic development of the Zhangjiakou area.

==Route description==
The Jingzhang Expressway is part of the Jingda Expressway and a part of the China National highway system, a network of trunk ways across mainland China. It stretches from the Beijing City Limits Toll Gate to Zhangjiakou, crossing through locations such as the Guanting Reservoir. While the expressway starts in Beijing, the majority of it runs within Hebei province.

The basic route begins at Badaling Expressway; goes through Donghuayuan, Huailai, and Xiahuayuan; and terminates at Zhangjiakou.

==History==
The expressway was created in segments, starting in Hebei. The challenge was how to cross the Guanting Reservoir. Initial plans avoided bridges and instead routed traffic around the reservoir. In the end, a bridge across the Guanting Reservoir was built, shortening the expressway&#x27;s total distance.

The Jingzhang Expressway&#x27;s final segment—linking it to the Badaling Expressway—was completed in November 2002. As of that moment, traffic could flow directly from Beijing through to Zhangjiakou in the form of a direct expressway. Previously, traffic entered the expressway bound for Zhangjiakou only at the Tumu toll gate (later disused), from Beijing.

===August 2010 traffic jam===
Even though this initial traffic jam was solved, poor road conditions persisted for years. And in August 2010, one of the longest traffic jams ever recorded lasted more than ten days. Lorries carrying supplies to help road construction and ease congestion around the city were one of the main causes for the traffic jam. Roughly 100,000 travelers ended up in the traffic jam. Throughout the whole traffic jam vendors sold drivers and passengers food and water as they waited for the whole ordeal to end.

Potential trouble spots included:
* Guanting service area
* Toll gates (on the expressway, not at the individual exits)
* Major checkpoint at Kangzhuang, Beijing

At the toll station in Daijiaying, and at every exit in the Beijing direction, road signs urged drivers to use China National Highway 110 instead of the Jingzhang Expressway. The traffic jam meant that usual two-hour trip from Zhangjiakou to Beijing took nearly two days instead.

These traffic jams continued on and off well into 2005. As a result, a second expressway linking Beijing to Zhangjiakou is in the plans.

The main reason for the jams was bureaucracy. At every change of jurisdiction, there was a toll gate where lorries not only paid their tolls but also underwent weight examinations. The issue was every province had different standards and did not recognise the certificates issued from toll gates in other provinces claiming that the lorries were not overloaded, forcing trucks to redo the test in every province. Beijing enforced a very low tolerance and forced even passenger cars to undergo the weight examination.

If a lorry was overweight, it had to unload and pass through the test again. Few people cooperated, instead willing to sit it out by parking their lorries on the hard shoulder of the expressway. The average time it took for a lorry to get through the test varied from five to 50 minutes, depending on the results.

==Road conditions==

===Speed limit===
Most of the expressway has a speed limit of 110 km/h. Hillier terrain and the Guanting Bridge have a lower speed limit of 80 km/h. Speed checks are rare.

===Tolls===
The entire stretch charges tolls. The toll system is not networked.

===Lanes===
The expressway has four lanes (two up, two down) throughout.

===Surface conditions===
Surface conditions are moderately good.

===Traffic===
Traffic conditions to Zhangjiakou from Beijing are better than those in the opposite direction.

==Major exits==
Major exits from the expressway are at Donghuayuan, Huailai, Jimingyi, Xiahuayuan, and Zhangjiakou.

==Service areas==
The Guanting Service Area is next to the Guanting Bridge.

==Connections==
The expressway becomes Badaling Expressway 60 km from Beijing.

After exit no. 5, the Jingzhang Expressway spins off to the right; continuing straight ahead leads to Datong in Shanxi province via the Xuanda Expressway instead.

==List of exits==

Key: ↗ = exit, ⇆ = main interchange; ¥ = central toll gate; S = service area

Exits heading west and northwest from Beijing (City Limits Toll Gate) are:

<doc id="826034" wikidata="Q941081" url="?curid=826034" title="Half-track">
<text>A half-track is a civilian or military vehicle with regular wheels at the front for steering and continuous tracks at the back to propel the vehicle and carry most of the load. The purpose of this combination is to produce a vehicle with the cross-country capabilities of a tank and the handling of a wheeled vehicle.

==Performance==

The main advantage of half-tracks over wheeled vehicles is that the tracks reduce the pressure on any given area of the ground by spreading the vehicle&#x27;s weight over a larger area, which gives it greater mobility over soft terrain like mud and snow, while they do not require the complex steering mechanisms of fully tracked vehicles, relying instead on their front wheels to direct the vehicle, augmented in some cases by track braking controlled by the steering wheel.

It is not difficult for someone who can drive a car to drive a half-track, which is a great advantage over fully tracked vehicles, which require specialized training. Half-tracks thus facilitate moving personnel and equipment successfully across varying terrain.

The main disadvantage is the increased maintenance to maintain track tension, and the reduced life span of tracks (up to 10,000 km) compared to tires (up to 80,000 km).

==History==

===Kégresse track===


The French engineer Adolphe Kégresse converted a number of cars from the personal car pool of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to half-tracks in 1911. His system was named after him: the Kégresse track, which used a flexible belt rather than interlocking metal segments. He applied it to several vehicles in the imperial garage, including Rolls-Royce cars and Packard trucks. The Imperial Russian Army also fitted the system to a number of their Austin Armoured Cars. From 1916 onward, there was a Russian project by the Putilov Plant to produce military half-tracks (the Austin-Putilov model), along the same lines, using trucks and French track parts.

After the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union, Kégresse returned to his native France, where the system was used on Citroën cars between 1921 and 1937 for off-road and military vehicles.

===Steam log hauler===

The concept originated with the hauling of logs in the northeastern US, with the Lombard Steam Log Hauler built by Alvin Lombard of Waterville, Maine, from 1899 to 1917. The vehicle resembled a railway steam locomotive, with sled steering (or wheels) in front and at the rear, crawlers driven by chains instead of the driving wheels of a locomotive.

By 1907, dog and pony show operator H. H. Linn abandoned his gas-and-steam-powered four- and six-wheel-drive creations and had Lombard build a motor home/traction engine run by an underslung four-cylinder Brennan gasoline engine to travel the unimproved roads of the day, with wheels at the front and tracks at the rear: the first payload-carrying half-track. By 1909 this was replaced by a smaller machine with two wheels at the front and a single track behind, since rural wooden bridges presented problems.

Stability issues, together with a dispute between Linn and Lombard, led Linn to create the Linn Manufacturing Company, builder of the Linn tractor, for building and putting onto the market his own improved civilian half-track–style machines. Lombard attempted to follow but, for the most part, remained a pulling machine. Linn would later register &quot;Haftrak&quot; and &quot;Catruk&quot; as trademarks, the latter for a half-track meant to convert hydraulically from truck to crawler configuration.


===World War I===
Tractors used to tow artillery and designs with front wheels and tracks at the rear began to appear prior to the outbreak of war, often based on agricultural machines such as the Holt tractor. The basic half-track concept was originally showcased by the British during the war.

With such tractors, the tactical use of heavier guns to supplement the light horse-drawn field guns became feasible. For example, in the British Army it allowed the heavy guns of the Royal Garrison Artillery to be used flexibly on the battlefield. In England, starting in 1905, David Roberts of Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons had attempted to interest British military officials in a tracked vehicle, but failed.

Holt bought the patents related to the &quot;chain track&quot; track-type tractor from Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons in 1914 for £4,000. Unlike the Holt tractor, which had a steerable tiller wheel in front of the tracks, the Hornsby crawler was steered by controlling power to each track.

When World War I broke out, with the problem of trench warfare and the difficulty of transporting supplies to the front, the pulling power of crawling-type tractors drew the attention of the military. With tanks coming onto the scene, however, the combination of tracks and wheels seemed impractical when fully tracked or six-wheel, four-wheel drive vehicles were available.

The half-track saw a comeback in the 1930s, with development occurring in several countries that would use them in World War II. The White Motor Company, which had designed armored cars for the United States Army and United States Marines, continued after the First World War to develop armored cars and added tracks for the M2 half-track car and M3 half-track.

===&quot;Autochenille&quot; and &quot;autoneige&quot;===
There were many civilian half-track experiments in the 1920s and 1930s. The Citroën company sponsored several scientific expeditions crossing deserts in North Africa and Central Asia, using their &quot;autochenilles&quot;. After World War I, the US military wanted to develop a semi-tracked personnel carrier vehicle, so it looked at these civilian half-tracks. In the late 1920s the US Army purchased several Citroën-Kégresse vehicles for evaluation followed by a licence to produce them. This resulted in the Army Ordnance Department building a prototype in 1939. In September 1940 it went into production with the military M2 and M3 half-track versions.

With the snow and ice of Canada in mind, Joseph-Armand Bombardier developed 7- and 12-passenger half-track &quot;autoneiges&quot; in the 1930s, starting what would become the Bombardier industrial conglomerate. The Bombardier vehicle had tracks for propulsion in the rear and skis for steering in front. The skis could be replaced with wheels in the summer, but this was uncommon.

The Red Army also experimented with half-tracks, such as the BA-30, but found them expensive and unreliable. Although not a feature on American World War II vehicles, steering could be assisted by track braking, controlled by the steering wheel.
===World War II half-track use===
In the US, 43,000 halftracks were produced by three primary manufacturers, the largest being the White Motor Company, the original designer, with a total of 15,414 accepted by the War Department. The other manufacturers, Autocar and Diamond T, built 12,168 and 12,421, respectively. These designs were produced under license in Canada, and were widely supplied under the Lend Lease program, with 5,000 supplied to the USSR alone. 

The fourth manufacturer of American-made half-tracks was the International Motor Truck Corporation division of International Harvester. IH built approximately 12,853 half-tracks, which were shipped to Europe for use by British and French troops. In 1942, they produced 152 M5 units and 5 M14 units at the Springfield Works; in 1943 they produced 2,026 M9 units, 1,407 M0A1 units, 4,473 M5 units, 1,600 M14 units, and 400 M17 units, all at the Springfield Works; in 1944 they produced 1,100 M5A1 units and 1,100 M17 units also at the Springfield Works; and in 1945 they built 589 M5A1 and 1 M5A3 units at Springfield Works. The IHC half-tracks differed visibly from the White, Diamond T, and AutoCar units in several ways. The IHC units had flat front fenders instead of fenders with compound curves; used the International Red Diamond 450 engines instead of the Hercules 160AX engines used by the other manufacturers; used IHC Model 1856 4-speed transmissions instead of the Spicer 4-speed transmissions used by the other manufacturers; had IHC Model FOK-1370 front drive axles instead of the Timken front axles used by their competitors; used IHC Model RHT-1590 axles in the rear instead of the Timken axles used by their competitors; and were constructed with fully welded armor with rounded rear corners instead of the bolted armor with square corners used by the other three manufacturers.

In August 1944, Allied forces liberated Paris. The first vehicle to enter the city was an M3 named &quot;España Cañí&quot; and driven by Spanish soldiers fighting under the French tricolor. There followed several days of parades in late August. One parade of 25 August 1944 was down the Champs-Élysées, with Charles de Gaulle leading throngs of Parisians, and French soldiers driving IH half-tracks.

====Infantry transporters====
Half-tracks were used extensively in World War II, especially by the Germans with their armored Demag-designed Sd.Kfz. 250s and Hanomag-designed Sd.Kfz. 251s; and by the Americans with their M2s and M3s.

====Support weapon platforms====
Half-tracks were widely used as mortar carriers, self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, self-propelled anti-tank guns, armored fighting vehicles and in other tasks.

====Utility and tractor half-tracks====
The Germans used a small 2 seater 1/2-ton class half-track &quot;motorcycle&quot;, the Sd.Kfz. 2 (better known as the &quot;Kleines Kettenkraftrad&quot; HK 101 or &quot;Kettenkrad&quot; for short – &quot;Ketten&quot; meaning tracks, and &quot;krad&quot; being the military abbreviation of the German word &quot;Kraftrad&quot;, the administrative German term for motorcycle), to pull small artillery guns, for ammunition haulage, general transport and as a ground towing vehicle for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter. Built by NSU Motorenwerke AG Neckarsulm and Stoewer Werke Stettin, a total of 8,345 vehicles were produced between 1940 and 1944.

Other Wehrmacht models were:
* 1-ton class, Sd.Kfz. 10 produced by Demag, Berlin; Adler, Frankfurt am Main; Büssing-NAG, Brunswick; Phänomen, Cottbus and Saurer, Vienna, a total of 25,000 vehicles - its drivetrain was used for the Sd.Kfz. 250
* 3-ton class, Sd.Kfz. 11 produced by Hanomag, Adler, Auto-Union and Skoda from 1938 to 1944, a total of 25,000 vehicles - its drivetrain was used for the Sd.Kfz. 251
* 5-ton class. Sd.Kfz. 6, manufactured by Büssing-NAG, Berlin-Oberschönweide; Daimler-Benz and Praga (Czechoslovakia), about 3,500 vehicles in total
* 8-ton class. Sd.Kfz. 7, production was of about 12,000 vehicles
* 12-ton class. Sd.Kfz. 8, some 4,000 vehicles were produced by five manufacturers
* 18-ton class. Sd.Kfz. 9, a production of only 2,000 vehicles

Larger German half-track tractors were used to tow anti-tank and field artillery pieces. The largest of these were also used by mechanical engineers to retrieve bogged down vehicles or perform repairs such as engine maintenance. Maultier half-tracks used to transport supplies to forward units were essentially civilian trucks which had had their rear axles replaced by Panzer I or Panzer II running gear. A replacement half-track design introduced later in World War II, the 1943-introduced &quot;Schwerer Wehrmachtschlepper&quot;, was meant to replace the 3-tonne and 5-tonne capacity models – only some 825 examples were built before the war&#x27;s end.

A common feature of virtually all German World War II half-tracks was the so-called &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; overlapped/interleaved roadwheel arrangement with a &quot;slack track&quot; system possessing no return rollers under the return run of track, used from the small &quot;Kettenkrad&quot; to the nine-tonne capacity Sd.Kfz. 9 vehicle, and most famously used on Henschel&#x27;s Tiger I and MAN&#x27;s Panther main battle tanks.

===Cold War use===
Half-tracks were extensively used after World War II until the late 1960s, mostly in form of surplus World War II vehicles. Half-tracks saw combat in the French colonial empire in the First Indochina War and the Algerian War; in the Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts; and the early wars of the Arab–Israeli conflict.

Half-tracks continued in use by the Israeli Army where they were deemed to outperform fully tracked and fully wheeled vehicles for non-combat payload tasks such as carrying telecommunications equipment. As of March 2008, 600 half-tracks were still officially listed as on active duty.

==Civilian use==
Many Second World War half-tracks were sold off to civilian users either as surplus stock or later due to obsolescence when the fully tracked armoured personnel carrier was introduced into service. Most were used in engineering-related tasks involving terrain that would be difficult for even four-wheel drive trucks, such as snow, sand and water-logged soil. Many were significantly modified for their new roles, including being fitted with winches, small cranes, and generators after the rear cabin sides were removed.

Some World War II half-tracks were used as all-terrain fire department pumpers or tankers.

<text>.hack//Liminality is an OVA series directly related to the &quot;.hack&quot; video game series for the PlayStation 2, with the perspective of &quot;Liminality&quot; focused on the real world as opposed to the games&#x27; MMORPG &quot;The World&quot;. &quot;Liminality&quot; was separated into four volumes; each volume was released with its corresponding game. The initial episode is 45 minutes long, while subsequent episodes are 30 minutes long. The video series was directed by Koichi Mashimo, written by Kazunori Itō with music by Yuki Kajiura. Primary Animation production was handled by Mashimo&#x27;s studio Bee Train which collaborated for the four games as well as handled major production on .hack//Sign.

==Releases==
The games were packaged with DVDs featuring episodes of &quot;.hack//Liminality&quot;, an original video animation (OVA) series that depicts events that occur concurrently with the games.

==Plot==

===In the case of Mai Minase===

The episode starts when Tokuoka was kicked out of CC Corp. Mai and her boyfriend, Tomonari Kasumi (known to The World as Sieg), are taken to a hospital due to both of them collapsing while playing a MMORPG called The World. Despite Mai waking up shortly after arriving at the hospital, Tomonari remains in a coma. For this, Mai is the object of rumors, especially when the clubhouse (known as G-study) is closed after the incident. It is soon revealed that she heard a certain sound (which is also present at important points in &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;) shortly before collapsing, and she later discovers that it is A in C major, which is used to tune instruments, including her violin. It was this sound that enabled her to wake up, and it was the first sound she made when she did. She meets Junichiro Tokuoka, and although she distrusts him at the beginning, as they investigate into Tomonari&#x27;s coma, they soon become allies, if not friends. The investigation itself starts with Tokuoka accessing Tomonari&#x27;s (Sieg&#x27;s) account on The World, with Mai providing the password. Tokuoka accidentally opens the e-mail, and discovers that two users, Yukichin and Kyo, are close with Tomonari and have been harassing him with e-mails regarding his absence. It is also revealed during the course of the episode that Tomonari took the name &quot;Sieg&quot; as a contraction of Siegfried, from Richard Wagner&#x27;s operatic cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. Balmung is the name of Siegfried&#x27;s sword, and Tomonari told Mai that he would become the possessor rather than the sword: a reference to the fact that he aimed to surpass the player character Balmung of the Azure Sky, one of the Descendants of Fianna. Tokuoka and Mai&#x27;s investigation leads them to break into G-study, in order to attempt to recreate the same situation so that they can find out why Mai and Tomonari collapsed. The sound starts up again when they enter a field, and although Mai saves herself, Tokuoka seems to be losing it. In desperation, Mai destroys the monitor and the computer that they were using, and drags him outside, where a splash of rainwater wakes him up. After that, the two pledge to find out just what C.C.Corp. is hiding, and what it will take to wake everyone up.

An interesting easter egg is if you turn on the subtitles, in the scene where Tomonari&#x27;s friend is fixing the computer, for a few seconds, keywords will pop up. Those keywords in the Theta server lead to where the Soul Blades reside.

===In the case of Yuki Aihara===

Tokuoka and Mai are on their way to meet with Yuki (known to The World as Yukichin), who is in Yokohama. Tokuoka gets stuck in traffic, and Mai goes to the library in Tokyo to attempt to look up information. During this time, she hears the sound. Meanwhile, Yuki is watching a movie when suddenly THE WORLD flashes on the screen, the power goes out, and the employees attempt to evacuate the building. Yuki runs into an unnamed woman who works at the building, and the two try to find their way out while the crowd gets stuck on the broken escalators. The two eventually resort to climbing through a ventilation shaft to a hallway with an elevator. After the fire alarm activates and starts sending out carbon dioxide, the woman rips off her shirt sleeves and makes mittens for both of them to slide down the elevator cables. At the same time, Tokuoka is finding his way to the meeting point without his car, as it is still trapped in gridlock, and Mai is using an old offline newspaper reel to look up information. She comes across Harald Hoerwick (the creator of The World), and the Epitaph of Twilight. Later, she contacts Kyo, and finds out that fires have broken out all over Yokohama, and that there is no cell phone service there either. Yuki and the woman find themselves at the bottom of the shaft, and it seems that the woman has twisted her ankle. They make their way onto the first floor regardless, and discover upon exiting the building that many cars have crashed. The woman says that it is the second coming of Pluto&#x27;s Kiss. Finally, at 9:00, six hours after Tokuoka said that he would meet Yuki, he arrives to find Yuki waiting for him. Mai finally gets through to Tokuoka, and Kyo gets through to Yuki, and it is discovered that Kyo knows quite a bit about the Epitaph of Twilight.

===In the case of Kyoko Tohno===

Junichiro Tokuoka travels to the city of Hida-Takayama to meet up with a miss Kyoko Tohno to discuss further details surrounding the mysteries in &quot;The World&quot; as well as the legends surrounding &quot;The Epitaph of Twilight.&quot;

After receiving a phone call from a person working under the alias Bith the Black, Tokuoka and Kyoko realize that they are being watched by Helba&#x27;s agents. A series of messages from Bith lead them to numerous historical sites throughout the city. As several of the messages come from e-mails sent to Mai Minase and Yuki Aihara, Tokuoka suspects that Helba has been following their actions for quite some time.

The team begins to eventually put together the puzzle behind the mysterious woman of Emma Wielant the author of &quot;the Epitaph.&quot; After a chance run in with Kyoko&#x27;s Father, they discover that he was contacted by Bith as well, working under another alias &quot;Ichiro Sato&quot;.

Over lunch Ichiro explains that Harald Hoerwick had used the game Fragment, the precursor to The World, to create a tribute to Emma&#x27;s Epitaph of Twilight. But that alone wouldn&#x27;t explain the current situation facing The World. He goes on to say that the incidents involving the coma victims were created as a result of Harald attempting to bring the real world into the online world, creating a hazy barrier between the two worlds, a concept called &quot;Liminality&quot;.

Ichiro informs Tokuoka and Kyoko that he needs their help, but that in helping him, they will become criminals. Despite the risk, they both agree to help. Ichiro says that CC Corp intends to shut down the servers of The World, thereby destroying any possible clues to awakening the coma victims. He tells them to meet with him on Christmas Eve at Urayasu, then drives away. Tokuoka asks Kyoko if she&#x27;s really sure about helping him, causing her to reaffirm her commitment to the cause.

===Trismegistus===

Several weeks after the meeting in Hida-Takayama on Christmas Eve, Junichiro Tokuoka, Kyoko Tohno, Yuki Aihara, and Mai Minase all gather on a dinner boat in Tokyo Bay, to prepare for their risky (and most certainly illegal) mission. Despite their nervousness, each one is dedicated to helping Ichiro Sato complete the mission sent from Helba. Ichiro himself soon arrives on a different boat. While traveling to their destination, Ichiro reveals the true nature of the problems that have been plaguing The World. Harald Hoerwick&#x27;s program, &quot;Fragment&quot;, had been nothing more than a program to create an &quot;Ultimate AI&quot;. The system to create this A.I. had somehow become self autonomous, and was working to delay the birth of the A.I. known as Aura, to keep itself from finishing its purpose and ceasing to exist. If the problems are to be solved, the Ultimate A.I. must be born, and it is up to Tokuoka and his team to help that event occur.

Under the cover of night they sneak into a CC Corp data station located on the edge of the bay. Avoiding the guards, Ichiro hacks into the security system allowing them to enter the main building. Inside the central control room, Tokuoka begins setting up their hardware to gain access to the computer systems and join up in Helba&#x27;s private server. The data has to compile, an act which will take about 15–20 minutes to complete. While he waits, Tokuoka asks Yuki to bring him some coffee from a vending machine. She gets the coffee and brings it to him, not realizing that she just created several new problems. By using the vending machines she has triggered the security system potentially alerting the night security patrol staff to their presence.

Outside, a patrol car comes by, investigating the entrance into the facility. They figure it is nothing more than a system error but realize somebody is actually inside when they discover that somebody used one of the vending machines inside. Realizing they have been discovered, Ichiro enlists the help of Yuki and Kyoko to buy Tokuoka and Mai some time.

The data now compiled Tokuoka logs into The World using Sieg&#x27;s account. Mai finds herself watching a battle involving Sieg and a character named Orca. Suddenly, the server begins to malfunction and crash as CC Corp begins deleting their servers. Tokuoka realizes that if they complete this, everybody who is currently fighting will fall into a coma and the Ultimate A.I. will never be born. As he struggles to come up with a solution, Ichiro comes in and announces that they&#x27;re out of time.

Walking out of the police station, he finds Mai and the girls waiting for him. Mai says that the Ultimate A.I. has finally been born, and Tokuoka pulls out a disk containing enough evidence to bring CC Corp to court. The four happily go out to eat and celebrate their victory.

<doc id="826045" wikidata="Q638241" url="?curid=826045" title="Arcturus (band)">
<text>Arcturus is a Norwegian avant-garde metal band formed in 1991. Their name, which translates to &quot;Bear Guardian,&quot; references the Behenian fixed star Arcturus.

==History==
The band has released five official full-length albums. Arcturus has continuously experimented throughout their career, drawing influences and incorporating elements from a wide range of musical styles, including black metal and classical music, while maintaining their roots as a metal outfit.

===Early days===
The original line-up changed when bassist/vocalist Marius Vold (formerly of Thorns) left the band for personal reasons. The band soon earned the label of a black metal supergroup, consisting of Kristoffer &quot;Garm&quot; Rygg on vocals, Carl August Tidemann on guitar, Skoll on bass, and the two other original members, Hellhammer on drums and Steinar Sverd Johnsen as the main composer/keyboard player. In 1994, Samoth played guitar on the EP &quot;Constellation&quot; and released it on his record label, Nocturnal Art.

===Post-Garm era===
After three full-length albums, Rygg departed from the band. He was replaced by Øyvind Hægeland from the band Spiral Architect. Øyvind performed live with the band but did not appear on any recordings. On 5 January 2005, the band announced that Øyvind had moved too far away for his continued involvement to be practical, and they parted ways. He was succeeded by Simen &quot;ICS Vortex&quot; Hestnæs, who had previously provided vocals on three Arcturus tracks: &quot;Master of Disguise,&quot; &quot;The Chaos Path,&quot; and &quot;Painting My Horror&quot; on &quot;La Masquerade Infernale&quot;. Following Carl August Tidemann&#x27;s departure, Knut Magne Valle joined the band. In 2003, Tore Moren joined on second guitar for live performances and eventually became an official member of the band. Knut and Tore then shared lead guitar duties, with Knut using a 7-string guitar and Tore employing a standard 6-string guitar.

===Breakup===
On 16 April 2007, it was announced that the band would be disbanding, with further details revealed in an official statement released on the band&#x27;s website on 17 April. The official statement, written by all the band members, confirmed rumors that had circulated after their Melbourne concert—the final show of their Australian tour—during which ICS Vortex introduced the performance with the words, &quot;Welcome to the last Arcturus show — ever.&quot; The statement further explained that the decision to disband had been made &quot;some time ago,&quot; and that due to ongoing &quot;things&quot; in their careers and lives, the members could no longer &quot;find the time to continue working with this band.&quot; The statement concluded with a tribute to the band&#x27;s fans: &quot;We are humble and grateful to all the people that have supported and loved us over the years.&quot;

===Reunion===
Rumors circulated online that Arcturus might reform with Garm as the vocalist. Hellhammer confirmed that an Arcturus reunion was inevitable and that Garm had expressed interest in participating. However, Garm later indicated on his personal Facebook page that he was not interested. 

Furthermore, ICS Vortex mentioned plans to resurrect &quot;a band or three&quot; in a blog post shortly after his removal from Dimmu Borgir.

ICS Vortex confirmed an Arcturus reunion show at the ProgPower USA 2011 Festival. In addition, Vortex stated, &quot;Beloved freaks! ProgPower USA 2011 will host the first Arcturus concert in 5 years. This is our first performance in the United States, and since we&#x27;re all retarded, probably the last.&quot; The planned show was later canceled due to &quot;hibernation sickness&quot; and &quot;outdated parts.&quot; Instead, Arcturus planned its first reunion show to be at Avant-Garde Night vol. 2 in Poland, but this show was also canceled.

Arcturus finally performed their reunion show on 9 September 2011 at the KICK Nattklubb &amp; Scene in Kristiansand, Norway. ICS Vortex confirmed that the band was working on a new album. In 2012, they went on to perform at the Inferno Metal Festival, Hellfest Summer Open Air, the O2 Academy in Islington, and the Eindhoven Metal Meeting. On 10 October 2014, Arcturus confirmed on Facebook that ICS Vortex had finished recording vocals for their as-yet-untitled album.

After much speculation among fans online, on 26 February 2015, it was announced that Arcturus had signed a new recording contract with the German record label Prophecy Productions and that they would finally release their new album &quot;Arcturian&quot; on 8 May. The label commented: &quot;Arcturus are legend. Unparalleled in creativity, musicianship and artistic approach since their foundation days, mastermind Steinar &#x27;Sverd&#x27; Johnsen and his cosmic crew, consisting of past and present members of bands like Ulver, Mayhem, Dimmu Borgir, Borknagar, and Ved Buens Ende, have been dancing their very own tightrope between genius and madness ever since. With each of their releases being an interstellar journey of its own and always ahead of their time, Arcturus can justifiably be labeled as the epitome of avant-garde metal...&quot;

On 27 March 2015, Arcturus released &quot;The Arcturian Sign,&quot; the first single from &quot;Arcturian&quot;. The album was released on 8 May of that year.

<text>: &quot;For another Saint Theodore, see: Theodore Stratelates or Saint Theodore (disambiguation)&quot;.
Saint Theodore (Άγιος Θεοδώρος), distinguished as Theodore of Amasea, Theodore the Recruit (Θεοδώρος ό Τήρων), and by other names, is a Christian saint and Great Martyr, particularly revered in the Eastern Orthodox Churches but also honored in Roman Catholicism and Oriental Orthodoxy. According to legend, he was a legionary in the Roman army who suffered martyrdom by immolation at Amasea in Galatian Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey) during the Great Persecution under Diocletian in the early 4th century. Venerated by the late 4th century, he became a prominent warrior saint during the Middle Ages, attracted a great deal of additional legends including accounts of battle against dragons, and was often confused with (or was the original source of) the similar Theodore Stratelates of Heraclea. 

==Names==
Theodore is the English form of the Latin masculine given name from Ancient Greek &quot;Theódōros&quot; () from &quot;Theós&quot; (, &quot;God&quot;) + &quot;dō̂ron&quot; (, &quot;gift&quot;). In Rome, he was also known to locals as St Toto. He was eventually distinguished from other saints named Theodore as Theodore the Recruit, Theodore the Tyro, or Theodore the Soldier ( or ; or , &quot;Theódōros Tḗrōn&quot; or &quot;ho Tḗrōn&quot;). The same name is variously anglicized as Theodore Tiron, Tiro, Tyron, Tyro, and Teron. (Nilles argued that this epithet was a later mistake and that, rather than being a recruit, Theodore&#x27;s name had originally referenced his service in the .) The saint is also distinguished as Theodore of Amasea, Theodore of Euchaita, and Theodore Martyr. The epithets are not generally needed, as Theodore Tiron is generally the intendend saint when the name &quot;St Theodore&quot; is used without other clarification.
==Legend==
===Martyrdom===
Theodore was a Greek, born in Amasea. The basic legend recounts that Theodore&#x27;s cohort was sent to Pontus for winter quarters. Christianity was still illegal and Galerius, prior to his 311 Edict of Toleration at Serdica, enforced his co-emperor Diocletian&#x27;s Great Persecution. When the soldiers of Theodore&#x27;s cohort were obliged to perform pagan sacrifice at Amasea in Galatian Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey, about south of the Black Coast at Sinop), he refused and recounted a confession of faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Rather than immediately execute him, the judgestaking pity on his youthdelayed their sentence to allow him to change his mind. Theodore then burned the city&#x27;s temple of Magna Mater (Cybele), whereupon he was again arrested, tortured, and martyred by immolation. The year of his martyrdom is cited as 287 in the &quot;legenda aurea&quot;, but later tradition including Butler has the year 306. His relics were later carried to Euchaita, possibly his birthplace, by the Christian empress Eusebia sometime before her death in 360.
===Dragon slaying===


Iconography of a horseman with a spear overcoming evil as personified as a dragon was widespread throughout the Christian period. Iconographic representations of St Theodore as dragon-slayer are dated to as early as the 7th century, certainly by the early 10th century (the oldest certain depiction of Theodore killing a dragon is at Aghtamar, dated ). Theodore is reported as having destroyed a dragon near Euchaita in a legend not younger than the late 9th century. The earliest image of St Theodore as a horseman (named in Latin) is from Vinica, North Macedonia and, if genuine, dates to the 6th or 7th century. Here, Theodore is not slaying a dragon, but holding a &quot;draco&quot; standard.

The &quot;Christianisation&quot; of the Thracian horseman iconography can be traced to the Cappadocian cave churches of Göreme, where frescoes of the 10th century show military saints on horseback confronting serpents with one, two or three heads. One of the earliest examples is from the church known as Mavrucan 3 (), generally dated to the 10th century, which portrays two &quot;sacred riders&quot; confronting a two serpents twined around a tree, in a striking parallel to the Dioskuroi stela, except that the riders are now attacking the snake in the &quot;tree of life&quot; instead of a boar.
In this example, at least, there appear to be two snakes with separate heads, but other examples of 10th-century Cappadocia show polycephalous snakes.
A poorly preserved wall-painting at the (&quot;Snake Church&quot;) that depicts the two saints Theodore and George attacking a dragon has been tentatively dated to the 10th century, or alternatively even to the mid-9th. A similar example, but showing three equestrian saints, Demetrius, Theodore and George, is from the &quot;Zoodochos Pigi&quot; chapel in central Macedonia in Greece, in the prefecture of Kilkis, near the modern village of Kolchida, dated to the 9th or 10th century.

A 12th-century depiction of Theodore as equestrian dragon-slayer is found in four muqarna panels in the nave of the Cappella Palatina in Palermo.

The dragon motif was transferred to the George legend from that of his fellow soldier saint, Saint Theodore Tiro.
The transfer of the dragon iconography from Theodore, or Theodore and George as &quot;Dioskuroi&quot; to George on his own, first becomes tangible in the early 11th century. The oldest certain images of St. George combatting the serpent date are still found in Cappadocia, in particular the image in the church of Saint Barbara, Soganh (dated 1006 or 1021).

===The two Theodores===
The emergence of Theodore Stratelates as a separate saint is attested from the late 9th century. The two Theodores were frequently depicted alongside one another in the later Byzantine period. Theodore Stratelates had a shrine at Euchaneia, but was said to have originally been from Euchaita. His &quot;lives&quot; are listed in Bibliotecha Hagiographica Graeca 1760–1773.

Numerous conflicting legends grew up about the life and martyrdom of St Theodore so that, in order to bring some consistency into the stories, it seems to have been assumed that there must have been two different saints, St Theodore Tiron of Amasea and St Theodore Stratelates of Heraclea.

There is much confusion between these two saints, and each of them is sometimes said to have had a shrine at Euchaita in Pontus. In fact the shrine existed before any distinction was made between these two saints. The separate shrine of Stratelates was at Euchaneia, a different place. They were distinguished at least by the 9th century. However it is now generally accepted, at least in the west, that there was in fact only one St Theodore. Delehaye wrote in 1909 that the existence of the second Theodore had not been historically established, and Walter in 2003 wrote that &quot;the Stratelates is surely a fiction&quot;. Blackburn et al. treat the second figure as a promotion in rank of the former.

There were several churches dedicated to both saints, Theodore Tiron and Theodore Stratelates. For instance at Dobarsko and at Serres, at the monastery of Kuprianou at Constantinople and at Pergamon.

==Veneration==
The veneration of St Theodore is attested by the late 4th century, when Gregory of Nyssa preached an encomium or homily in his honor at his sanctuary in the winter of 381. It is uncertain if this sanctuary was located at Amasea or Euchaita, but a church at Euchaita related to pilgrimage in Theodore&#x27;s honor is known to have existed from at least . His cult spread rapidly and he became highly popular. The patriarch Nectarius preached a sermon on Theodore at Constantinople before 397. There was a church dedicated to him in Constantinople in 452, a mosaic created of him at Rome&#x27;s Church of SS Cosmas &amp; Damian , and San Teodoro al Palatino, a separate circular church in his honor at the foot of the Palatine, was consecrated in the 6th or 7th century.

The initial center of veneration was in the district around Amasea. From at least the 9th century (and possibly much earlier), Euchaita housed the relics of the saint and became an important place of pilgrimage, to the point it was also known as Theodoropolis. In a tradition recorded in the 10th or 11th century, a woman from Euchaita named Eusebia had transferred the saint&#x27;s relics according to his wishes. The same tradition also associates Theodore with the dragon slayer motif. In the late 11th century, the Amasea province was gradually overwhelmed by the Turkish invasion and Euchaita became depopulated.

St Theodore became especially important in the Eastern Orthodox Church, where his cult spread widely. Gregory of Nyssa said nothing about St Theodore&#x27;s life beyond the basic legend as given above, but he told how he could influence the lives of his hearers and specifically mentioned that he could intervene in battles. This became a particularly important attribute of St Theodore. Theodore was one of the important military saints of Byzantium and eventually had 15 churches in his honor in Constantinople. He was also widely venerated in Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine and there are churches dedicated to him in Jerusalem and Damascus. The oldest Georgian &quot;Bir el Qutt inscriptions&quot; mention him twice. After the period of iconoclasm, from the 9th century, he was depicted as a soldier in military dress. A tradition origating in Cappadocia from the 9th or 10th century depicted him as dragon-slayer alongside Saints Demetrius and George. He was adopted as a military saint by the crusaders.

In Western Europe, Theodore was the patron saint of Venice during its period under Byzantine hegemony and the doge&#x27;s chapel was dedicated to him until the 9th century, when Venice largely replaced him with St Mark as a sign of its growing independence. His cult spread during the Crusades. His body was said to have been transferred to Brindisi in the 12th century, after which he was honored as that city&#x27;s patron. Gaeta claimed to have taken his head. Chartres Cathedral in France has a 13th-century stained glass window with 38 panels depicting Theodore&#x27;s life, but his cult did not become common beyond Italy.

San Teodoro in Rome was made a collegiate church by Pope Felix IV and was made available to the Orthodox by Pope John Paul II in 2000, with services beginning in 2004.

===Iconography===
In mosaics and icons, he is most often shown in military dress from the 6th century, but sometimes in civilian or court dress. When on horseback, he is always in military dress, possibly spearing a dragon, and often accompanied by St George. Both he and St Theodore Stratelates are shown with thick black hair and pointed beards, usually one point for Theodore Tiron and two points for Stratelates.

His encounter with a dragon was increasingly transferred to the more-widely venerated Saint George beginning in the 13th century.

===Feast days===
In the Eastern church, St Theodore of Amasea is celebrated on 8 February in the Slavonic Byzantine calendar or on 17 February or on the 1st Saturday in Lent. In the western church, his date was 9 November but, since 1969 after the Second Vatican Council, he is no longer liturgically celebrated except in certain local calendars.

The Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, celebrate a miracle attributed to St. Theodore Tyro on the First Saturday of Great Lent. At the end of the Presanctified Liturgy on Friday evening (since, liturgically, the day begins at sunset) a special canon to St. Theodore, composed by St. John of Damascus, is chanted. Then the priest blesses kolyva (boiled wheat with honey and raisins) which is distributed to the faithful in commemoration of the following miracle worked by St. Theodore on the First Saturday of Great Lent:

Fifty years after the death of St Theodore, the emperor Julian the Apostate (361-363) commanded the governor of Constantinople during the first week of Great Lent to sprinkle all the food provisions in the marketplace with the blood offered to pagan idols, knowing that the people would be hungry after the strict fasting of the first week. Thus he would force the Christians to unknowingly eat food &quot;polluted&quot; (from the Christian perspective) with the blood of idolatry. St Theodore appeared in a dream to the Archbishop of Constantinople, Eudoxius, ordering him to inform all the Christians that no one should buy anything at the market, but rather to boil the wheat they had at home and eat it sweetened with honey.

After the service, the &quot;kolyva&quot; is distributed to all who are present and, after Holy Communion and the antidoron, is the first food eaten after the strict fasting of the first week.
===Venice===
St Theodore was the patron saint of Venice before the relics of Saint Mark were (according to tradition) brought to the city in 828. The original chapel of the Doge was dedicated to St Theodore, though, after the translation of the relics of St Mark, it was superseded by the church of St Mark.

There is some doubt whether this first patron of Venice was Theodore of Amasea or Theodore of Heraclea, although Demus opted emphatically for the latter in 1960 and was followed in this by Fenlon. However, Demus later noted that none of the 12th-century mosaics which show St Theodore mentions more than his name and that he may have become the patron of the city before the two saints were distinguished. In fact the Venetians never appear to have made any distinction between the different St Theodores. None of the mosaics in Venice&#x27;s St Mark&#x27;s Basilica show him in military dress.

There were 15 churches in Constantinople dedicated to St Theodore, who was a Greek saint, specially venerated by the Eastern church. Venice had originally been a subject city of the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Venetians saw St Theodore as a symbol of their subjection to Constantinople. The adoption of St Mark as their patron helped to establish their independence.

The new church of St Mark was built between the old chapel of St Theodore and the Ducal Palace. When this was enlarged and rebuilt in the late 11th century, the chapel of St Theodore disappeared in the rebuilding. There is today a small chapel dedicated to St Theodore, behind St Mark&#x27;s church, but this was not built until 1486. (It was later occupied by the Inquisition in Venice).
The two Byzantine columns in the Piazzetta in Venice were set up soon after 1172. The eastern column bears a strange animal representing the winged lion of St Mark. A statue representing St Theodore was placed on the western column in 1372, but this was not the statue now to be seen there, which is a composite of several fragments, some antique, including a crocodile to represent a dragon, and was placed there in the second half of the 15th century. The statue on the pillar is now a copy of the original, which is kept elsewhere for its preservation.

Reputed relics of St Theodore were taken from Mesembria by a Venetian admiral in 1257 and, after being first placed in a Venetian church in Constantinople, were brought to Venice in 1267. They were placed in the church of San Salvatore.

<doc id="826126" wikidata="Q11146497" url="?curid=826126" title="Jinji Expressway">
<text>The Jinji Expressway runs entirely within Tianjin, linking Tianjin city in the south with Ji County in the north, which is reflected in its name, Tianjin - Ji County - Jinji Expressway. The expressway stretches for 104 kilometres and opened on 26 September 2003, just days before China&#x27;s National Day holiday, October 1.

==Route==
It starts just after the Jinzhonglu exit on the Jingjintang Expressway and the Tianjin outer ring road, and heads northeast, gradually heading north, eventually crossing the Jingshen Expressway at Jinwei (Baodi North).

After this, it heads directly north toward Ji County, crossing China National Highway 102, before coming to an end at Bangxi Highway, near Ji County.

The expressway passes through Dongli District, Beichen District, Baodi District and Ji County.

The northern end is close to portions of the Great Wall of China. This end has been linked up to the Jingping Expressway since 2008. The Jinji Expressway therefore forms another (somewhat indirect) passageway from Beijing to Tianjin.

==Exits and Service Areas==
The expressway has remarkably few exits and just one service area. Additional toll charges apply for vehicles of non-Tianjin licence plates coming into Tianjin, waived only for military and diplomatic vehicles, as well as vehicles on emergency duty.

==Speed Limit==
There is a uniform speed limit of 110 km/h, albeit national legislation raising it to 120 km/h (which is the speed limit it was actually designed for).</text><links>

<doc id="826127" wikidata="Q1364020" url="?curid=826127" title="False awakening">
<text>A false awakening is a vivid and convincing dream about awakening from sleep, while the dreamer in reality continues to sleep. After a false awakening, subjects often dream they are performing their daily morning routine such as showering or eating breakfast. False awakenings, mainly those in which one dreams that they have awoken from a sleep that featured dreams, take on aspects of a double dream or a dream within a dream. A classic example in fiction is the double false awakening of the protagonist in Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Portrait&quot; (1835).

Studies have shown that false awakening is closely related to lucid dreaming that often transforms into one another. The only differentiating feature between them is that the dreamer has a logical understanding of the dream in a lucid dream, while that is not the case in a false awakening.

Once one realizes they are falsely awakened, they either wake up or begin lucid dreaming.

== Related concepts ==
=== Lucidity ===
A false awakening may occur following a dream or following a lucid dream (one in which the dreamer has been aware of dreaming). Particularly, if the false awakening follows a lucid dream, the false awakening may turn into a &quot;pre-lucid dream&quot;, that is, one in which the dreamer may start to wonder if they are really awake and may or may not come to the correct conclusion. In a study by Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett, 2,000 dreams from 200 subjects were examined and it was found that false awakenings and lucidity were significantly more likely to occur within the same dream or within different dreams of the same night. False awakenings often preceded lucidity as a cue, but they could also follow the realization of lucidity, often losing it in the process.

=== False awakenings loops ===
Because the mind still dreams after a false awakening, there may be more than one false awakening in a single dream. Subjects may dream they wake up, eat breakfast, brush their teeth, and so on; suddenly awake again in bed (still in a dream), begin morning rituals again, awaken again, and so forth. The philosopher Bertrand Russell claimed to have experienced &quot;about a hundred&quot; false awakenings in succession while coming around from a general anesthetic.

===Protoconscious world===
Giorgio Buzzi suggests that FAs may indicate the occasional re-appearing of a vestigial (or anyway anomalous) REM sleep in the context of disturbed or hyper-aroused sleep (lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis, or situations of high anticipation). This peculiar form of REM sleep permits the replay of unaltered experiential memories, thus providing a unique opportunity to study how waking experiences interact with the hypothesized predictive model of the world. In particular, it could permit to catch a glimpse of the protoconscious world without the distorting effect of ordinary REM sleep.

In accordance with the proposed hypothesis, a high prevalence of FAs could be expected in children, whose &quot;REM sleep machinery&quot; might be less developed.

====Gibson&#x27;s hypothesis====
Gibson&#x27;s dream protoconsciousness theory states that false awakening is shaped on some fixed patterns depicting real activities, especially the day to day routine. False awakening is often associated with highly realistic environmental details of the familiar events like the day to day activities or autobiographic and episodic moments.

== Symptoms ==
=== Realism and non-realism ===
Certain aspects of life may be dramatized or out of place in false awakenings. Things may seem wrong: details, like the painting on a wall, not being able to talk or difficulty reading (reportedly, reading in lucid dreams is often difficult or impossible). A common theme in false awakenings is visiting the bathroom, upon which the dreamer will see that their reflection in the mirror is distorted (which can be an opportunity for lucidity, but usually resulting in wakefulness).

== Types ==
Celia Green suggested a distinction should be made between two types of false awakening:

=== Type 1 ===
Type 1 is the more common, in which the dreamer seems to wake up, but not necessarily in realistic surroundings, that is, not in their own bedroom. A pre-lucid dream may ensue. More commonly, dreamers will believe they have awakened, and then either genuinely wake up in their own bed or &quot;fall back asleep&quot; in the dream.

A common false awakening is a &quot;late for work&quot; scenario. A person may &quot;wake up&quot; in a typical room, with most things looking normal, and realize they overslept and missed the start time at work or school. Clocks, if found in the dream, will show time indicating that fact. The resulting panic is often strong enough to truly awaken the dreamer (much like from a nightmare).

Another common Type 1 example of false awakening can result in bedwetting. In this scenario the dreamer has had a false awakening and while in the state of dream has performed all the traditional behaviors that precede urinatingarising from bed, walking to the bathroom, and sitting down on the toilet or walking up to a urinal. The dreamer may then urinate and suddenly wake up to find they have wet themselves.

=== Type 2 ===
The type 2 false awakening seems to be considerably less common. Green characterized it as follows:
Charles McCreery draws attention to the similarity between this description and the description by the German psychopathologist Karl Jaspers (1923) of the so-called &quot;primary delusionary experience&quot; (a general feeling that precedes more specific delusory belief). Jaspers wrote:
McCreery suggests this phenomenological similarity is not coincidental and results from the idea that both phenomena, the Type 2 false awakening and the primary delusionary experience, are phenomena of sleep. He suggests that the primary delusionary experience, like other phenomena of psychosis such as hallucinations and secondary or specific delusions, represents an intrusion into waking consciousness of processes associated with stage 1 sleep. It is suggested that the reason for these intrusions is that the psychotic subject is in a state of hyper-arousal, a state that can lead to what Ian Oswald called &quot;micro-sleeps&quot; in waking life.

Other researchers doubt that these are clearly distinguished types, as opposed to being points on a subtle spectrum.

== Experimental descriptions ==
The clinical and neurophysiological descriptions of false awakening are rare. One notable report by Takeuchi et al, was considered by some experts as a case of false awakening. It depicts a hypnagogic hallucination of an unpleasant and fearful feeling of presence in sleeping lab with perception of having risen from the bed. The polysomnography showed abundant trains of alpha rhythm on EEG (sometimes blocked by REMs mixed with slow eye movements and low muscle tone). Conversely, the 2 experiences of FA monitored here were close to regular REM sleep. Even, quantitative analysis clearly shows thetha waves predominantly, suggesting that these 2 experiences being product of a dreaming rather than a fully conscious brain.

The clinical and neurophysiological characteristics of false awakening are:-

# One does not feel paralysed.
# One feels that the surroundings are familiar.
# Frequently associated with anxiety.
# The EEG shows low Alpha and beta bands but high delta and theta bands.
# The EOG shows the presence of spontaneous REMs.

<text>David William Hughes (born 26 November 1970) is an Australian stand-up comedian, television and radio presenter. He is known for his larrikin personality, drawling Australian accent, and deadpan comedic delivery.

Hughes has previously been co-host of &quot;Hughesy &amp; Kate&quot; on Nova 100, KIIS Network and Hit Network, &quot;Hughesy, Ed &amp; Erin&quot; with Ed Kavalee &amp; Erin Molan on 2DayFM and a panellist on &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot; on Network 10.

==Early life==
After graduating from the all-boys Christian Brothers&#x27; College, Warrnambool in 1988, where he was dux of the school, Hughes briefly studied information technology at Swinburne University in Melbourne, and then accounting at Deakin University in Warrnambool before dropping out to eventually pursue a career in comedy.

==Career==
===Comedy===
After leaving university, it was seven years before Hughes found work as a stand-up comedian and he did a variety of jobs including working at an abattoir, as a bricklayer&#x27;s labourer and a shop assistant.

After dreaming about being a comedian since he was a youngster, his first comedy gig came at age 22 when he was living in Perth doing labouring jobs and he decided, &quot;I&#x27;m going to have a crack&quot;. Appearing onstage he acknowledges that he was &quot;just horrible&quot; but after three attempts over six months he gained his confidence and went on to become a headline act.

He is a regular performer at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Some of his shows have been released on CD (&quot;Dave Hughes: Whatever&quot;), and on DVD (&quot;Dave Hughes, Live&quot;, &quot;Dave Hughes - Handy&quot; and &quot;David Hughes - Pointless&quot;).

===Television===
Hughes had his first break on mainstream television when he was asked to do stand-up on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, a show Hughes revered growing up. Hughes recalled in a 2021 50-year anniversary &quot;Hey Hey&quot; special that he had not been more nervous before or since that set.

Hughes co-hosted the ABC comedy talk show &quot;The Glass House&quot; along with Wil Anderson and Corinne Grant. However, it was axed in 2006 amid political controversy.

He has had guest spots on television programs &quot;The Fat&quot;, &quot;Rove Live&quot;, &quot;The Panel&quot;, &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Your Generation&quot;, &quot;The Project&quot;, &quot;Studio 10&quot;, &quot;All Star Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Under Melbourne Tonight&quot;, &quot;Spicks &amp; Specks&quot;, &quot;The Living Room&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot;, &quot;Would I Lie to You? Australia&quot; and &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention?&quot;.

For ten years (2003–2013), Hughes was a co-host of the Australian Football League-themed Network Ten Saturday night show &quot;Before The Game&quot; alongside Mick Molloy, Anthony Lehmann, Andy Maher and Neroli Meadows.

Hughes worked on Australian television show &quot;Rove&quot; in 2007, with a weekly &quot;Hughesy Loses It&quot; segment. In 2008–09, the segment evolved into a recurring segment known as &quot;Help me Hughesy&quot; where he would rant about a given topic.

On 20 July 2009, Hughes began co-hosting the half-hour Channel 10 show &quot;The 7PM Project&quot;, which later expanded to become the hour-long &quot;The Project&quot;. His regular co-hosts were Charlie Pickering and Carrie Bickmore. In June 2011, Hughes was one of the few people to be granted a one-on-one interview with the Dalai Lama during his visit to Australia.

In December 2013 Hughes resigned from his full-time position on &quot;The Project&quot; to return to stand-up comedy. Hughes would, however, appear once a week on the show from wherever he was around the country. Hughes is quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s definitely a tough decision, as we have had so many unbelievable moments on the desk. You meet some of the biggest stars in the world and chat with them and have some wonderful times.&quot; Hughes later stated his reason for leaving &quot;The Project&quot; in 2016 with Mia Freedman on her podcast &quot;No Filter&quot;:The news cycle is so set, it&#x27;s just the same. The news cycle rarely changes. We talk about the same things endlessly and no one&#x27;s got the answers. Nothing&#x27;s changed in so long. But to sit there every night and talk about the same things, it&#x27;s just too much. I&#x27;m a comedian, so yeah, that&#x27;s really why.

Hughes began a year-long round of stand-up engagements around Australia, in Adelaide in February 2014, where he and his family will be based for five weeks before moving onto other venues.

In October 2014 Hughes guest-starred in an episode of ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Julia Zemiro&#x27;s Home Delivery&quot;, in which Zemiro accompanied Hughes back to his home-town of Warrnambool to reminisce about his childhood and to explore what influenced him to embark on a career in comedy.

Hughes was the new solo host of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in 2016.

Hughes returned to Network Ten in 2018 to host a new panel show, &quot;Hughesy, We Have a Problem&quot;. From 2019 to 2023, he was a panellist on &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot; for its full run. In 2025, Hughes appeared as a contestant on the eleventh season of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

===Radio===

==== Nova 100 ====
In December 2001 Hughes joined comedians Kate Langbroek and Dave O&#x27;Neil to co-host a weekday breakfast program &quot;Hughesy, Kate &amp; Dave&quot; from 6am to 9am on Melbourne&#x27;s Nova 100. In the past, he has worked for the Triple M network of Australian active rock radio stations. Dave O&#x27;Neil later left the station to join Vega 91.5.

==== KIIS Network ====
In November 2014 Australian Radio Network announced the show would relaunch on its KIIS Network of stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide in the drivetime slot, replacing Rosso on Drive on KIIS 106.5 and Mix 101.1, and local announcers on 97.3 FM and Mix 102.3. The show commenced on 27 January 2015, anchored by former 90.9 Sea FM and 2DayFM announcer Matty Acton. The show was pulled from the KIIS Network on 24 November 2016, a week prior to their final show. Hughes and Langbroek were unable to farewell listeners.

==== Hit Network ====

In September 2017 Southern Cross Austereo announced that Hughes and Kate Langbroek would join the Hit Network in 2018 to replace &quot;Hamish and Andy&quot;.

In January 2019 Kate Langbroek and her family moved to Bologna, Italy and Langbroek continued to host the show until June. In August 2019, it was announced that Kate will file reports for the show for the remainder of the year. Ed Kavalee filled in as co-host until December.

In December 2019 Kate Langbroek resigned from the show confirming that she will extend her time in Italy. Ed Kavalee has been announced as her replacement from January 2020 and the show was renamed &quot;Hughesy &amp; Ed.&quot; It was also announced that the show will air from 5pm until 7pm.

In November 2020, Southern Cross Austereo announced that Hughes, Ed Kavalee and Erin Molan would replace Jamie Angel to host &quot;The 2Day FM Morning Crew with Hughesy, Ed and Erin Molan&quot; from Monday, January 18, 2021. A one-hour highlights package will air nationally at 6pm across the Hit Network.

In August 2024, Southern Cross Austereo announced that &quot;Hughesy, Ed &amp; Erin&quot; had been axed with 2Day FM taking a new direction. The last show aired on Wednesday 7 August. &quot;Jimmy &amp; Nath&quot; will host breakfast for the remainder of the year.   

===Advertising===
In 2005 Hughes appeared in a series of television commercials for the Australian car manufacturer Holden.

In 2009 Huges appeared in a three embedded advertising zoot review shorts promoting the return of Samboy Chips in which he reveals his favourite flavour is Atomic Tomato and shows off his signature &quot;Conga Line&quot; chip eating technique. 
===Acting===
Early in his career, Hughes had a brief appearance in an episode of &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1998.

Hughes has also appeared in Ed Kavalee&#x27;s comedy films &quot;Scumbus&quot;, which aired on Ch-10 in 2012 and the yet-to-screen &quot;Border Protection Squad&quot;.

==Personal life==
He married Holly Ife, a reporter with the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, on 31 December 2006. They have three children together.

Hughes has haemochromatosis. He gave up drinking alcohol when he was 22 after deciding that it had become a bad influence in his life. Hughes is a vegan.

Hughes is a keen supporter of the Carlton football team in the AFL and even asked the Dalai Lama to bless Carlton; after doing so, the Dalai Lama commented: &quot;It probably won&#x27;t do much, and it didn&#x27;t.&quot;

==Controversy==

During the 2007 Logie Awards, which he co-hosted with Adam Hills and Fifi Box, Hughes referred to radio shock-jock Kyle Sandilands as a &quot;massive dickhead&quot; to applause and laughter from the audience. Later that year, when interviewed on &quot;Enough Rope&quot; with Andrew Denton, Sandilands said of Hughes, &quot;I hate him – the next time I see him I&#x27;m going to punch him in the throat.&quot; Hughes retorted by releasing an official apology, which said in part that Hughes was &quot;sincerely and deeply sorry that Kyle Sandilands is a massive dickhead&quot; and that &quot;massive dickheads have the same rights as normal people.&quot;

<text>Sunny Beach ( , &quot;Slanchev bryag&quot;) is a seaside resort on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, north of Burgas and south of Varna.

Created in 1958 as a weekend getaway for Bulgarian families, Sunny Beach has become the largest tourist and vacation spot in the country. Today, the area contributes a significant part of the province&#x27;s annual gross domestic product. Initially a small beachside resort, it has grown to include a large variety of recreational activities and services, gambling establishments as well as sports and music venues.

Its rapid growth makes it the largest resort on the entire Black Sea coast; to the south, the complex has merged with the town of Nesebar.

== Tourism ==

Sunny Beach has a very small permanent population, but during the summer the resort is home to many thousands of tourists. The main strip of high-rise hotels backing onto the beach is long and extends along a wide bay between Sveti Vlas and Nessebar, soon to connect with the village of Tankovo.

=== History ===

The planning of Sunny Beach began in 1957, and construction began with decree No 120/30 June 1958 of the Council of Ministers of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria.
The construction of Sunny Beach began north of the Nessebar Strait in an area that geographers have long called the small Nessebar desert - endless sands that form dunes, including two wells of geraniums. From these two wells, a kilometer away from the town, the inhabitants of the peninsula drank water.

On June 1, 1959, the first restaurant, &quot;Neptune&quot;, was opened.

During the afforestation of Sunny Beach, 550,000 m³ of fertile soil were transferred to the territory of the complex, 300,000 coniferous and deciduous large-sized trees were planted, 770,000 ornamental shrubs, 100,000 roses, 200,000 dunes, with investments exceeding BGN 150 million.

Sunny Beach is the first Bulgarian resort to be awarded the Blue Flag eco award, erected by a beach ritual in front of the Europe Hotel on July 4, 1995.

The millionth tourist of the complex was registered on September 22, 1969. The two millionth tourist of the complex was registered on August 30, 1973. The five millionth tourist was registered on June 15, 1981. Official statistics show that for the period 1959 - 1988 7 699 100 people were vacationing in Sunny Beach, of which 5 162 600 were foreign tourists and 2 536 590 Bulgarian citizens. In 1989 it has 108 hotels with over 27,000 beds and over 130 restaurants, attractions and public places, night clubs, bars and discos, coffee shops and aperitifs. Sunny Beach EAD was a 100% state-owned joint-stock company until March 14, 1994, when it was announced for privatization by the Privatization Agency. On July 16, 1997, after the sale by the state of 25% of the company&#x27;s capital through the first wave of mass privatization, the name of the issuer was changed to Sunny Beach AD.

Sunny Beach was selected as one of the Top 100 Beaches in the world in 2024, according to the prestigious Golden Beach Award, which highlights destinations renowned for their beauty, vibrant atmosphere, inclusivity, community spirit, and cultural significance.

==Transport==
The airports serving Sunny Beach are Burgas Airport and Varna Airport. After the construction of the Black Sea highway, Sunny Beach has established itself as one of the largest socio-economic centers in Eastern Bulgaria. The resort is connected with the cities of Varna, Burgas, and Sofia through numerous bus lines.

==Attractions==
Attractions for tourists include the beach, water sports, and the nearby historic site of Nessebar. There are two water parks near the resort and third to be built soon near the exit to Kosharitca.
The Decade of Symphonic Music, part of the International Folklore Festival, fashion shows, and various beach competitions are held in Sunny Beach. The Golden Orpheus song contest was held here until 1999.

==Climate==
Sunny Beach has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;; Trewartha climate classification &quot;Cf&quot;). Average annual temperatures is around 14 °C. During the summer the sea temperatures stay around 26 °C. Winters are cool, windy and have moderate rainfall.

==Media==
The BBC has broadcast the programme &quot;Booze, Bar Crawls and Bulgaria: Stacey Dooley Investigates&quot;. This focussed on the negative aspects of the Sunny Beach resort such as excessive drinking, overpriced private medical treatment and the availability of illegal drugs.

The UK&#x27;s Channel 4 have commissioned Dragonfly Film and Television Productions to film three episodes of the next series of &quot;What Happens in Sunny Beach, Bulgaria&quot;. The show portrays the activities of Britons who escape their mundane lives to enjoy the lawlessness of Sunny Beach.

In 2022, Channel 4 also commissioned Parable to produce the 6-part documentary series &quot;Emergency on Sunny Beach&quot;, covering how local emergency services and frontline workers handle the summer peak in tourists, and what they think of the British tourists. The series was broadcast in 2023.

<doc id="826212" wikidata="Q7822832" url="?curid=826212" title="Tony Lupien">
<text>Ulysses John &quot;Tony&quot; Lupien Jr. (April 23, 1917 – July 9, 2004) was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was a left-handed batter who played for the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox. Lupien was an all-around athlete and successful coach. He was the grandfather of professional wrestler and hollywood actor John Cena.

==Early life==
Lupien was born in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, the son of Eugenie Gosselin and Ulysses J. Lupien. His parents were of French Canadian descent, and his father was named &quot;Ulysses&quot; because of his great-grandfather&#x27;s admiration for president Ulysses S. Grant. Lupien graduated from Harvard in 1939. At Harvard, he was captain of the baseball team as a junior and of the basketball team as a senior. He was the Eastern Intercollegiate League batting champion in 1938 and 1939, and he also was a quarterback for his freshman football team.

==Career==
Upon graduation from Harvard, Lupien signed a professional baseball contract with the Red Sox and played the 1939 season for the Double-A Scranton Red Sox Eastern League championship team. He made his major league debut for the Red Sox on September 12, 1940. One of his most productive seasons came in 1942 when he batted .281 with three home runs and 70 runs batted in for the Red Sox. He was traded to the Phillies where he played in 1944 and early in 1945, before serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II. In the 1944 season, he hit .283 with five homers, 52 RBI, 82 runs, 23 doubles, 9 triples and 18 stolen bases. After his discharge from the Navy, Lupien played two years for the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, where his 1947 record of batting .341, with 21 homers and 110 RBI, led to his return to the major leagues for one final season in 1948, with the White Sox.

Lupien finished his MLB career hitting .268 with 18 home runs, 230 RBI, 285 runs, 92 doubles, 30 triples, and 57 stolen bases in 614 games. Excellent defensively, he recorded a .993 fielding percentage with only 45 errors in 6077 total chances in 602 games covering 5338 innings. In 1949, he played with Triple-A Toledo (American Association). He concluded his professional career from 1951 to 1953 and in 1955 when he was a player as well as field and general manager with the Jamestown Falcons and Corning Independents, in the PONY League. From 1951 to 1956, he was head basketball coach at Middlebury College, compiling a record of 60–49 in five seasons.

In 1956, Lupien was hired as the Dartmouth Big Green baseball coach. He spent 21 seasons at Dartmouth College and guided his teams to 313 wins, 305 losses and three ties, winning the Eastern Baseball Intercollegiate League championship four times (1963, 1967, 1969–70). His 1970 team advanced to the College World Series at Omaha, Nebraska where it finished fifth. That team had a 24–10 record that included a 21-game win streak. He was also the Dartmouth freshman basketball coach from 1956 to 1968.

==Personal life and legacy==
Lupien retired from coaching in 1977, but continued to work for many years as a stockbroker with various firms in New England. He died in Norwich, Vermont, at 87 years of age. He was married to Natalie Nichols, and later to Mildred Robinson. His grandson is professional wrestler and actor John Cena, with whom he shared a birthday. He was Catholic.

Lupien was recognized for decades as a great teacher and mentor. He was also an outspoken observer of labor relations in professional baseball. In 1980 he collaborated with writer Lee Lowenfish to author &quot;The Imperfect Diamond&quot;, a book that remains a definitive text on baseball labor from the introduction of the reserve clause in 1879 to the litigation in the 1970s that led to free agency.

<text>Colonel Robert Hope Moncrieff Aitken (8 February 1826 – 18 September 1887) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details of Nomination==
He was 31 years old, and a lieutenant in the 13th Bengal Native Infantry, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC:
==Later life==

In later life he achieved the rank of colonel.

He died in 1887 and is buried in the Eastern Cemetery at St Andrews on the upper terrace.

==Family==

Robert was the son of John Aitken and Jane Christie, of Cupar, Fife, Scotland. He came from a long line of army personnel. His cousin Robert Digby-Jones also received the Victoria Cross (posthumously) for actions at Ladysmith in 1900.

==Legacy==

His Victoria Cross is now part of the collections at the National Army Museum &quot;(Chelsea, England)&quot;. He is unique in that the decoration ceremony took place at the same location, the Residency at Lucknow, nearly at the exact spot where several of his V.C. actions had occurred. However, he did not receive the actual medal on this occasion, as it had been mislaid.

A memorial was erected at the Residency in Lucknow. It reads:

<doc id="826216" wikidata="Q1648748" url="?curid=826216" title="Galaxy morphological classification">
<text>Galaxy morphological classification is a system used by astronomers to divide galaxies into groups based on their visual appearance. There are several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies, the most famous being the Hubble sequence, devised by Edwin Hubble and later expanded by Gérard de Vaucouleurs and Allan Sandage. However, galaxy classification and morphology are now largely done using computational methods and physical morphology.

== Hubble sequence ==

The Hubble sequence is a morphological classification scheme for galaxies invented by Edwin Hubble in 1926.
It is often known colloquially as the “Hubble tuning-fork” because of the shape in which it is traditionally represented. Hubble&#x27;s scheme divides galaxies into three broad classes based on their visual appearance (originally on photographic plates):
* Elliptical galaxies have smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in images. They are denoted by the letter &quot;E&quot;, followed by an integer &quot;n&quot; representing their degree of ellipticity on the sky. The specific ellipticity rating depends on ratio of the major (a) to minor axes (b), thus:
:: formula_1
* Spiral galaxies consist of a flattened disk, with stars forming a (usually two-armed) spiral structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge, which is similar in appearance to an elliptical galaxy. They are given the symbol &quot;S&quot;. Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge. These barred spirals are given the symbol &quot;SB&quot;.
* Lenticular galaxies (designated S0) also consist of a bright central bulge surrounded by an extended, disk-like structure but, unlike spiral galaxies, the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity.

These broad classes can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance and to encompass other types of galaxies, such as irregular galaxies, which have no obvious regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal).

The Hubble sequence is often represented in the form of a two-pronged fork, with the ellipticals on the left (with the degree of ellipticity increasing from left to right) and the barred and unbarred spirals forming the two parallel prongs of the fork on the right. Lenticular galaxies are placed between the ellipticals and the spirals, at the point where the two prongs meet the “handle”.

To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in amateur astronomy.
Nonetheless, in June 2019, citizen scientists through Galaxy Zoo reported that the usual Hubble classification, particularly concerning spiral galaxies, may not be supported, and may need updating.

== De Vaucouleurs system ==

The de Vaucouleurs system for classifying galaxies is a widely used extension to the Hubble sequence, first described by Gérard de Vaucouleurs in 1959. De Vaucouleurs argued that Hubble&#x27;s two-dimensional classification of spiral galaxies—based on the tightness of the spiral arms and the presence or absence of a bar—did not adequately describe the full range of observed galaxy morphologies. In particular, he argued that rings and lenses are important structural components of spiral galaxies.

The de Vaucouleurs system retains Hubble&#x27;s basic division of galaxies into ellipticals, lenticulars, spirals and irregulars. To complement Hubble&#x27;s scheme, de Vaucouleurs introduced a more elaborate classification system for spiral galaxies, based on three morphological characteristics:

The different elements of the classification scheme are combined — in the order in which they are listed — to give the complete classification of a galaxy. For example, a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms and a ring is denoted SAB(r)c.

Visually, the de Vaucouleurs system can be represented as a three-dimensional version of Hubble&#x27;s tuning fork, with stage (spiralness) on the &quot;x&quot;-axis, family (barredness) on the &quot;y&quot;-axis, and variety (ringedness) on the &quot;z&quot;-axis.

===Numerical Hubble stage===
De Vaucouleurs also assigned numerical values to each class of galaxy in his scheme. Values of the numerical Hubble stage &quot;T&quot; run from −6 to +10, with negative numbers corresponding to early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) and positive numbers to late types (spirals and irregulars). Thus, as a rough rule, lower values of &quot;T&quot; correspond to a larger fraction of the stellar mass contained in a spheroid/bulge relative to the disk. The approximate mapping between the spheroid-to-total stellar mass ratio (MB/MT) and the Hubble stage is MB/MT=(10−T)2/256 based on local galaxies.

Elliptical galaxies are divided into three &#x27;stages&#x27;: compact ellipticals (cE), normal ellipticals (E) and late types (E+). Lenticulars are similarly subdivided into early (S−), intermediate (S0) and late (S+) types. Irregular galaxies can be of type magellanic irregulars (&quot;T&quot; = 10) or &#x27;compact&#x27; (&quot;T&quot; = 11).
The use of numerical stages allows for more quantitative studies of galaxy morphology.

== Yerkes (or Morgan) scheme ==
The Yerkes scheme was created by American astronomer William Wilson Morgan. Together with Philip Keenan, Morgan also developed the MK system for the classification of stars through their spectra. The Yerkes scheme uses the spectra of stars in the galaxy; the shape, real and apparent; and the degree of the central concentration to classify galaxies.



Thus, for example, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as kS5.

<text>Major-General Ernest Wright Alexander (2 October 1870 – 25 August 1934) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
===Early career===
Ernest Wright Alexander was born at 87 Everton Road, Liverpool on 2 October 1870, the son of one of the directors of the Suez Canal. Alexander was educated at Harrow School before going to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery as a second lieutenant on 27 July 1889.

In 1892 he travelled to serve in India, where he was promoted to lieutenant on 27 July, and to captain on 26 December 1899. Alexander returned to England in 1900 before completing a second tour of India between 1903 and 1906, leaving upon his promotion to major on 25 April. The military historian J. M. Bourne describes Alexander&#x27;s career to this point as &quot;unspectacular&quot;.

===Action at Elouges===
Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, and Alexander began his service in the First World War. Stationed in Belgium, he took part in the Great Retreat later the same month. Commanding the 119th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, Alexander was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for gallantry on 24 August, during the action of Elouges. When the flank guard was attacked by a German corps, Alexander handled his battery against overwhelming odds with such conspicuous success that all his guns were saved notwithstanding that they had to be withdrawn by hand by himself and volunteers led by a Captain (Francis Octavius Grenfell) of the 9th Lancers. This enabled the retirement of the 5th Division to be carried out without serious loss. Subsequently, Major Alexander rescued a wounded man under heavy fire. The full citation for his VC reads as follows:

===Later service===
Grenfell also received the VC, and two of Alexander&#x27;s sergeants were awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Alexander&#x27;s VC was the third to be won during the First World War, two having been achieved on the day before his. He was subsequently created a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1915.Alexander&#x27;s bravery saw him gain quick promotion during the war, being promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier-general within a year of fighting at Elouges.

Towards the start of 1916 he was appointed Brigadier General Royal Artillery to XV Corps, a unit which played a large role in the First day on the Somme. Alexander laid down effective artillery barrages as XV Corps advanced, playing a large part in the success of its attacks at Fricourt and Mametz. The military historian, Brigadier-General Sir James Edmonds, was so impressed by Alexander&#x27;s techniques that he reproduced full plans of his barrages in the &quot;History of the Great War&quot;. Alexander continued to develop his creeping barrages which proved pivotal in XV Corps&#x27; victory at the Battle of Bazentin Ridge on 14 July.

After being made a brevet colonel in January 1917, Alexander was subsequently given command of the Royal Artillery serving in XI Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Haking, in May. He continued with XI Corps until April 1918 when he was promoted to major-general and given command of First Army&#x27;s Royal Artillery. This promotion came about because First Army was commanded by General Sir Henry Horne, who had been promoted off the back of his successes while in command of XV Corps in 1916, and perceived he owed a debt to Alexander for this.

Alexander continued to receive awards as the war came to an end, being created a Cavalier of the Military Order of Savoy in September 1918, and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in January 1919. In August he then received the French Croix de Guerre and was created a Grand Officer of the Military Order of Avis by Portugal. He went on to command the Royal Artillery within the Southern Area of Aldershot Command.

He retired from the army in October 1920 and, having reverted to his substantive rank of colonel the year before, in March 1919, was granted the honorary rank of major-general.

===Retirement===
In retirement Alexander became a deputy lieutenant of Devon on 17 June 1931.

He died in his 64th year on 25 August 1934 in Kingsbridge, Devon, and was buried at Putney Vale Cemetery. His medal group is on display at the Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>α-Ethyltryptamine (αET, AET), also known as etryptamine, is an entactogen and stimulant drug of the tryptamine family. It was originally developed and marketed as an antidepressant under the brand name Monase by Upjohn in the 1960s before being withdrawn due to toxicity.
Side effects of αET include facial flushing, headache, gastrointestinal distress, insomnia, irritability, appetite loss, and sedation, among others. A rare side effect of αET is agranulocytosis. αET acts as a releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as a weak serotonin receptor agonist, and as a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor. It may also produce serotonergic neurotoxicity. αET is a substituted tryptamine and is closely related to α-methyltryptamine (αMT) and other α-alkylated tryptamines.
αET was first described in 1947. It was used as an antidepressant for about a year around 1961. The drug started being used recreationally in the 1980s and several deaths have been reported. αET is a controlled substance in various countries, including the United States and United Kingdom. There has been renewed interest in αET, for instance as an alternative to MDMA, with the development of psychedelics and entactogens as medicines in the 2020s.

==Medical uses==
αET was previously used medically as an antidepressant and &quot;psychic energizer&quot; to treat people with depression. It was used for this indication under the brand name Monase.

===Available forms===
αET was available pharmaceutically as the acetate salt under the brand name Monase in the form of 15mg oral tablets.

==Effects==
αET is reported to have entactogen and weak psychostimulant effects. Euphoria, increased energy, openness, and empathy have been specifically reported. Unlike αMT and other tryptamines, αET is not reported to have psychedelic or hallucinogenic effects. The drug is described as less stimulating and intense than MDMA (&quot;ecstasy&quot;) but as otherwise having entactogenic effects resembling those of MDMA. The dose of αET used recreationally has been reported to be 100 to 160mg, its onset of action has been reported to be 0.5 to 1.5hours, and its duration of action at the preceding doses is described as 6 to 8hours. Rapid tolerance to repeated administration of αET has been described.

==Side effects==
Side effects of αET at antidepressant doses have included facial flushing, headache, gastrointestinal distress, insomnia, irritability, and sedation. Additional side effects of αET at recreational doses have included appetite loss and feelings of intoxication. Feelings of lethargy and sedation can occur once the drug wears off.

As with many other serotonin releasing agents, toxicity, such as serotonin syndrome, can occur when excessive doses are taken or when combined with certain drugs such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Several deaths have been associated with recreational use of αET.

Rarely, agranulocytosis has occurred with prolonged administration of αET at antidepressant doses and has been said to have resulted in several cases and/or deaths.

==Overdose==
αET has been administered in clinical studies at doses of up to 300mg per day. An approximate but unconfirmed 700mg dose resulted in fatal hyperthermia and agitated delirium in one case. LD50 doses of αET for various species have been studied and described. Treatment of αET intoxication or overdose is supportive. Severe and potentially life-threatening hyperthermia may occur. Serotonergic toxicity associated with serotonergic agents like αET can be managed with benzodiazepines and with the serotonin receptor antagonist cyproheptadine.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Similarly to αMT, αET is a releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, with serotonin being the primary neurotransmitter affected. It is about 10-fold more potent in inducing serotonin release than in inducing dopamine release and about 28-fold more potent in inducing serotonin release than in inducing norepinephrine release. The (+)-enantiomer of αET, (+)-αET, is a serotonin–dopamine releasing agent (SDRA) and is one of the few such agents known. It is about 1.7-fold more potent in inducing serotonin release than in inducing dopamine release, about 17-fold more potent in inducing serotonin release than in inducing norepinephrine release, and is about 10-fold more potent in inducing dopamine release than in inducing norepinephrine release.

In addition to acting as a monoamine releasing agent, αET acts as a serotonin receptor agonist. It is known to act as a weak partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ( &gt; 10,000nM; Emax = 21%). (–)-αET is inactive as a 5-HT2A receptor agonist at concentrations of up to 10μM, whereas (+)-αET is a 5-HT2A receptor agonist with an EC50 value of 1,250nM and an Emax value of 61%. αET has also been found to have weak affinity for the 5-HT1, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F, and 5-HT2B receptors.

αET is a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). It is specifically a selective and reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). An value of 260μM &quot;in vitro&quot; and 80 to 100% inhibition of MAO-A at a dose of 10mg/kg in rats &quot;in vivo&quot; have been reported. αET is described as slightly more potent as an MAOI than dextroamphetamine. Both enantiomers of αET have similar activity as MAOIs, whereas αET&#x27;s major metabolite 6-hydroxy-αET is inactive. The relatively weak MAOI actions of αET have been considered unlikely to be involved in its stimulant, antidepressant, and other psychoactive effects by certain sources.

The stimulant effects of αET have been said to lie primarily in (–)-αET, whereas hallucinogenic effects have been said to be present in (+)-αET. However, these claims appear to be based on animal drug discrimination studies and are not necessarily in accordance with functional studies. Generalization to may have been anomalous and due to the serotonin-releasing actions of αET rather than due to serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation and associated psychedelic effects. Accordingly, αET does not produce the head-twitch response in rodents, unlike known psychedelics. In addition, clear hallucinogenic effects of αET have never been documented in humans even at high doses, although the individual enantiomers of αET have never been studied in humans.

αET has been found to produce serotonergic neurotoxicity similar to that of MDMA and &quot;para&quot;-chloroamphetamine (PCA) in rats. This has included long-lasting reductions in serotonin levels, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, and serotonin uptake sites in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The dosage of αET employed was 8doses of 30mg/kg by subcutaneous injection with doses spaced by 12-hour intervals. There are prominent species differences in the neurotoxicity of monoamine releasing agents. Primates appear to be more susceptible to the damage caused by serotonergic neurotoxins like MDMA than rodents.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The absorption of αET appears to be rapid. It has a relatively large volume of distribution. The drug undergoes hydroxylation to form the major metabolite 6-hydroxy-αET (3-(2-aminobutyl)-6-hydroxyindole). This metabolite is inactive. αET is eliminated primarily in urine and a majority of a dose is excreted in urine within 12 to 24hours. Its elimination half-life is approximately 8hours.

==Chemistry==
αET, also known as 3-(2-aminobutyl)indole, is a substituted tryptamine and α-alkyltryptamine derivative. Analogues of αET include α-methyltryptamine (αMT) and other substituted α-alkylated tryptamines like 5-MeO-αET, 5-chloro-αMT (PAL-542), and 5-fluoro-αET (PAL-545).

==History==
αET was first described in the scientific literature in 1947. The enantiomers of αET were first individually described in 1970.

Originally believed to exert its effects predominantly via monoamine oxidase inhibition, αET was developed during the 1960s as an antidepressant by Upjohn chemical company in the United States under the generic name etryptamine and the brand name Monase, but was withdrawn from potential commercial use due to incidence of idiosyncratic agranulocytosis in several patients. It was on the market for about a year, around 1961, and was given to more than 5,000patients, before being withdrawn. αET was usually used as an antidepressant at doses of 30 to 40mg/day (but up to 75mg/day), which are lower than the doses that have been used recreationally.

αET gained limited recreational popularity as a designer drug with MDMA-like effects in the 1980s. Subsequently, in the United States it was added to the Schedule I list of illegal substances in 1993 or 1994.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
&quot;Etryptamine&quot; is the formal generic name of the drug and its and . In the case of the acetate salt, its generic name is &quot;etryptamine acetate&quot; and this is its . Etryptamine was used pharmaceutically as etryptamine acetate. Etryptamine is much more well known as &quot;alpha-ethyltryptamine&quot; or &quot;α-ethyltryptamine&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;αET&quot;, &quot;α-ET&quot;, or &quot;AET&quot;). Other synonyms of αET and/or its acetate salt include &quot;3-(2-aminobutyl)indole&quot;, &quot;3-indolylbutylamine&quot;, &quot;PAL-125&quot;, &quot;U-17312E&quot;, &quot;Ro 3-1932&quot;, &quot;NSC-63963&quot;, and &quot;NSC-88061&quot;, as well as its former brand name &quot;Monase&quot;.

===Recreational use===
αET has been used as a recreational drug since the 1980s. Purported street names include Trip, ET, Love Pearls, and Love Pills.

===Legal status===
αET is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States and a Class A controlled substance in the United Kingdom.

==Research==
Besides depression, αET has been studied in people with schizophrenia and other conditions.

<text>The Médaille militaire (, &quot;Military Medal&quot;) is a military decoration of the French Republic for other ranks for meritorious service and acts of bravery in action against an enemy force. It is the third highest award of the French Republic, after the Legion of Honour, a civil and military order, and the Order of Liberation, a Second World War-only order. The &quot;Médaille militaire&quot; is therefore the most senior entirely military active French decoration.

During World War I, 230,000 &quot;médailles&quot; were awarded, when 1,400,000 French Army soldiers were killed and 3,000,000 wounded. For comparison, the UK Military Medal was awarded on 115,000 occasions in World War I, when 673,375 British Army soldiers were killed and 1,643,469 wounded. There were 628 awards to 627 recipients of the Victoria Cross, the United Kingdom&#x27;s highest military decoration. 

The award was first established in 1852 by the first President of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte who may have taken his inspiration from a medal established and awarded by his father, Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland.

After the First World War, the Military Medal was also temporarily awarded for wounds received in combat.

==Statute==
Like many other French awards, the &quot;médaille&quot; can be awarded for different reasons. It can be awarded to foreign nationals serving with or alongside the French armed forces.

* To members of the military other than commissioned officers (including enlisted ranks, non-commissioned officers and &quot;aspirants&quot; or Officer Designate).
** As an award for valour, it is the second highest award ranking immediately after the Legion of Honour.
** As an &quot;in between&quot; medal for enlisted members, NCO and O(D) awarded the Legion of Honour for &quot;combat actions&quot;, nowadays mostly done posthumously.
** As a service medal, for long-serving NCOs.
* To generals and admirals who have been commanders-in-chief, as a supreme award for leadership. These general officers must already have been awarded the grand cross of the Legion of Honour.

==Award description==
The Médaille militaire is a silver laurel wreath, in diameter, wrapped around a central gold medallion bearing the left profile of Marianne, effigy of the French Republic, the original 2nd Empire variant bore the left profile of Emperor Napoleon III. The central gold medallion is surrounded by a blue enamelled ring bearing the gilt inscription &quot;RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE&quot; () with a small gilt five-pointed star at the bottom for a 4th Republic award, three stars for a 5th Republic variant, the 3rd Republic variant bore the date 1870, the 2nd Empire variant bore the gilt inscription &quot;LOUIS-NAPOLEON&quot; in lieu of &quot;RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE&quot; and had flowers on both sides of the small star at the bottom. The original variant was topped by a silver imperial eagle with a loop through which the suspension ring passed, all other variants were and are topped by a device composed of a breastplate superimposed over crossed cannons, a naval anchor, sabres, swords and battle axes, to which the suspension ring passes through a loop for attachment to a ribbon. The reverse of the medallion is common to all variants since inception of the award, it bears the relief inscription on three lines &quot;VALEUR ET DISCIPLINE&quot; () and is surrounded by a blue enamelled ring.

The ribbon of the Médaille militaire is wide, yellow in color with green stripes on each edge. This ribbon was borrowed from the Order of the Iron Crown which it effectively replaced in France.


==Recipients==


The Médaille militaire was awarded in some number to British and allied forces (allies of the French Empire) during the Crimean War of 1854–1856 and in reasonably large numbers to allied forces in the 1914–1918 war. During the Second World War, the &quot;Médaille&quot; reached its highest numbers of foreign bestowals, most often to members of the British Army as well as to the United States military. The general&#x27;s &quot;médaille&quot; was awarded to Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Josip Broz Tito, as supreme commanders of the UK, US and Yugoslav military forces, but to also effective military leaders, such as General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower, and to Admiral of the Fleet Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope.

==Unit award==
In addition to the individual medal, the Médaille militaire is also authorized as a unit award to those military commands who display the same criteria of bravery as would be required for the individual medal. The &quot;médaille&quot; is displayed on the flag of these units. It is one of the rarest unit awards in the French military.

This unit award should not be confused with the &quot;fourragère de la médaille militaire&quot;, which is a cord suspended from the shoulder of a military uniform worn by members of units which had been mentioned in despatches. A &quot;fourragère aux couleurs du ruban de la médaille militaire&quot; (&quot;fourragère&quot; in the colours of the ribbon of the &quot;médaille militaire&quot;) is worn by units which had been mentioned four times, a &quot;fourragère aux couleurs de la légion d&#x27;honneur et de la médaille militaire&quot; (&quot;fourragère&quot; in the colours of the ribbons of the &quot;légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; and the &quot;médaille militaire&quot;) for units mentioned twelve times. Ten American units can wear the &quot;fourragère de la médaille militaire&quot;.

<text>John Alexander VC (died 24 September 1857) was a British Army soldier and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Alexander was a private in the 90th Perthshire Light Infantry (later known as The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)), during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 18 June 1855 after the attack on the Redan at Sebastopol, Alexander went out from the trenches under very heavy fire and brought in several wounded men. On 6 September, when he was with a working party in the most advanced trench, he went out under heavy fire and helped to bring in a captain who was severely wounded.

He was later killed in action during the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny in British India on 24 September 1857.

==The medal==
Private Alexander&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the National War Museum of Scotland at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland.

<text>AET is a Malaysian-owned Singapore-headquartered owner and global operator of crude and clean petroleum tankers alongside specialist activities including dynamic positioning shuttle tankers (DPSTs), hydro-carbon capture and ship-to-ship lightering to oil and gas companies, refineries and petroleum traders. Its fleet of over 60 vessels includes 11 LNG dual-fuel vessels comprising five dual-fuel VLCCs, four dual-fuel Aframaxes and two dual-fuel Dynamic Positioning Shuttle Tankers, making it one of the leading providers of maritime transport to the international petroleum industry.

==History==
Originally a subsidiary of Neptune Orient Lines, AET, formerly American Eagle Tankers, was formed in Houston in 1994 to serve the US Gulf lightering market. From a fleet of just three tankers, the company grew to become a major force in that rapidly developing market.

In April 2003, it was announced that AET would become a wholly owned subsidiary of international logistics provider MISC Berhad (formerly the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation). The sale was finalised in July 2003. At that time, AET was operating around 25 vessels and this provided MISC with the critical mass and strategic positioning to serve its global petroleum customers with coverage in the Atlantic Basin, the Persian Gulf and the East Coast.

In 2007, the company&#x27;s operations around the world were brought together under the single, global brand of AET.

==AET today==
AET has its headquarters in Singapore with commercial operations being conducted from regional offices in Houston, London, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Galveston, Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo and Stavanger.

On behalf of oil majors and large trading houses, AET transports crude oil across the world&#x27;s oceans in its fleet of Dynamic Positioning Shuttle Tankers (DPST), Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC), Aframax and Suezmax tankers. It also moves refined products in a fleet of smaller clean tankers. In addition, the company leads the industry in the provision of US Gulf lightering services with over 14,000 ship-to-ship (STS) transfers in total – a specialised operation involving the safe transfer of crude oil at sea from large tankers to smaller ships that are more suited to enter the ports along the US coast. As part of its commitment to this sector, AET has in its fleet lightering support vessels (LSVs) - the first purpose built vessels of this kind to be constructed anywhere in the world - to replace its old workboat fleet.

The company&#x27;s current fleet (as at 31 March 2021) totals 11 DPSTs, 9 VLCCs, 28 Aframax, one Panamax, 6 Suezmax and 19 clean tankers. Expansion plans include a further 11 vessels that are currently being built. The latest fleet list can be found on their website.

<text>A fork in the road is a metaphor, , for a deciding moment in life or history when a choice between presented options is required, and, once made, the choice cannot be reversed.

==Examples==
*There is a common motif in Russian folk tales, where a vityaz (Russian knight) comes to a fork in the road and sees a menhir with an inscription that reads: &quot;If you ride to the left, you will lose your horse, if you ride to the right, you will lose your head&quot;.
*The phrase appears in the Book of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 21:19–23 NRSV).
&quot;Mortal, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall issue from the same land. And make a signpost, make it for a fork in the road leading to a city; mark out the road for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites or to Judah and to Jerusalem the fortified. 
*A fork in the road is mused upon by Robert Frost in his poem &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;, which begins, &quot;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...&quot;
*Malapropist extraordinaire Yogi Berra&#x27;s saying &quot;When you come to a fork in the road, take it&quot; made the title of his book &quot;When You Come to a Fork in the Road, Take It!: Inspiration and Wisdom From One of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Heroes&quot;. 
*It is also depicted in the book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; where Alice came to a fork in the road and saw a Cheshire cat in the tree. 
*The album cover of &quot;A Nice Pair&quot; includes a literal depiction of a fork in the road, a visual pun on the expression..
*During the inauguration of Donald J Trump as the 47th President of the United States of America on January 20, 2025, Elon Musk said in his controversial speech &quot;This was a fork in the road in human civilization.&quot; On January 28, the Trump administration Office of Personnel Management sent an email titled &quot;Fork in the Road&quot; to over 2 million federal employees that essentially offered them 8 months salary if they would quit. The email was similar to a same titled email Musk sent to all Twitter employees when he took over that company.

<text>Michael Allmand (22 August 1923 – 24 June 1944) was an English Second World War recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born into a Catholic family in London in 1923, Allmand attended Ampleforth College before studying history at Oxford University in 1941. He joined the British Indian Army in 1942 and was commissioned into the Indian Armoured Corps for service in the Far East.

He later volunteered to serve with the Chindits and in 1944 saw action against the Japanese during the Battle of Mogaung, during which he was killed in action at the age of 20.

==Early life==
Michael Allmand was born in Golders Green, London, to Professor Arthur John MC and Marguerite Marie Allmand on 22 August 1923. Allmand&#x27;s father, son of Frank (1858-1948) and Mary Allmand, née Thomas (1861-1918), was a Professor of chemistry at King&#x27;s College London and later dean of the faculty who came from a flour milling family in Wrexham, England (later Wales). The Allmands originated in the Malpas area of Cheshire. Allmand&#x27;s mother Marguerite hailed from a family of Normans from the Saint-Lô district who were small landowners and professionals. Allmand grew up in a bilingual home speaking both English and French.

Allmand had a brother, the medieval historian Christopher Allmand (1936–2022), and a sister Marguerite Allmand (1921–2009), later Marguerite Murphy, who was a member of the Auxiliary Territorial Service and worked as a code breaker at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. Allmand was raised in a Roman Catholic family, with his father being a convert to the faith and later a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, who were parishioners at St. Edward the Confessor Church Golders Green. Allmand himself had a deep and abiding religious faith.

Allmands childhood home was at No 5 North Square, Hampstead Garden Suburb.

Allmand was educated at Ampleforth College, in North Yorkshire, England, before attending Oriel College, Oxford in 1941 where he began to study history. While at Oxford, Allmand served as the founding editor of a literary review journal called &quot;The Wind and the Rain&quot;, and began writing a biography of Edmund Burke.

==Military career==
At the end of 1942, amidst the backdrop of World War II, Allmand left university and joined the British Indian Army. He was commissioned into the Indian Armoured Corps, and assigned to the 6th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own Lancers. Allmand was sent to India where, following a call from GHQ India, he volunteered for service with the Chindits during Operation Thursday and was subsequently attached to the 3rd Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles (3/6 GR).

For the operation, 3/6 GR were assigned to the 77th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Mike Calvert, and divided into two columns. They were flown in by glider to landing zone BROADWAY in the northern Kaukwe valley on 5 March 1944. Despite heavy casualties and the destruction of a large number of gliders, a stronghold was established and from there columns were sent out to the north and south. The 3/6 GR were sent north towards Mawlu and Hopin where they probed Japanese defences. They were later sent north to another stronghold dubbed &quot;Blackpool&quot; where they were tasked with supporting Chinese forces around Mogaung and Myitkyina under US General Joseph Stilwell, who re-roled them as conventional infantry. Beginning on 6 June, the 77th Brigade advanced the final to Mogaung with the intent of capturing it. Between monsoonal rains and heavy casualties from the fighting as well as tropical diseases, the advance took a heavy toll on the Chindits. They were facing over 4,000 Japanese and by the end of the first week the brigade, having started with over 2,000 men, was down to just 550 and each battalion was at company strength.

Initially, Allmand was given command of a platoon. On 11 June, two days after 3/6 GR had reached the outskirts of the town, Allmand&#x27;s platoon was tasked with capturing a road bridge about away from the central railway station, close to where the Japanese had established their headquarters in a building dubbed the &quot;Red House&quot;. During the assault, his platoon took heavy fire and the attack stalled; leading from the front, Allmand went ahead, rallying his troops as he attacked the defenders with grenades and his kukri. Later he was promoted to acting captain and took over command of a company following the loss of its commander. He was again in the thick of the fighting on 13 June when he led an assault to secure some high ground by singlehandedly destroying several machine-gun positions.

On 23 June, during the final stages of the advance on Mogaung, Allmand&#x27;s company was tasked with capturing Natyigon village and securing the railway bridge that spanned the Mogaung River. Attacking to the left of the &quot;Red House&quot;, Allmand&#x27;s company was held up by machine-gun fire from an embankment near the bridge, Allmand went forward again. His movement was hampered by severe trench foot due to the poor conditions that the Chindits had faced. He nevertheless fought his way &quot;through deep mud and shell-holes&quot; and knocked out the machine-gun with grenades before being wounded. A short time later, another member of 3/6 GR, Tul Bahadur Pun, charged the bridge singlehandedly, killing the remaining Japanese defenders and securing it for the Gurkhas. Both Tul Bahadur and Allmand were later nominated for the Victoria Cross.

It was largely due to Allmand&#x27;s bravery that Mogaung was captured. Although he was pulled out of the line of fire by another Gurkha – Sergeant Tilbir Gurung, who received the Military Medal for his act – Allmand subsequently died of his wounds early on 24 June. At the time he was just two months short of his twenty-first birthday. His Victoria Cross was awarded posthumously and was presented to his family by King George VI at Buckingham Palace on 17 July 1945, having been announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 26 October 1944. Allmand also received the following other decorations: the 1939–1945 Star, the Burma Star and the War Medal 1939–1945.

Allmand&#x27;s body is interred at the Taukkyan War Cemetery, in Burma.

==Victoria Cross citation==
The citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; which announced Allmand&#x27;s award reads:

== Legacy ==

The Victoria Cross medal remained in Allmand&#x27;s family&#x27;s possession until 1991, when it was presented to the Regimental Trust in Hong Kong. Later, in 2003, the medal was donated to the Gurkha Museum at Winchester in Hampshire, England.

Allmand&#x27;s life is commemorated in the Memorial Window at the St Edward the Confessor Catholic Church in Golders Green, London. 

Allmand is named on the Chindit Memorial, Memorial Gates and the Oriel College War memorial. He is also commemorated in John Bunting&#x27;s Scotch Corners Chapel, a chapel on the edge of the North Yorkshire Moores dedicated to the War dead of Ampleforth College.

The Michael Allmand Trophy is presented by the Combined Cadet Force contingent at Ampleforth College to the Cadet who scores the highest in their leadership competition. Allmand is also commemorated in the Library of Ampleforth where a painted portrait of him hangs. Allmand&#x27;s name was added to the Golders Green War Memorial by fixing his name on to the bronze book that commemorates the World War II victims.

<text>Ascot Racecourse is a dual-purpose British racecourse, located in Ascot, Berkshire, England, about 25 miles west of London. Ascot is used for thoroughbred horse racing, and it hosts 13 of Britain&#x27;s 36 annual Flat Group 1 horse races and three Grade 1 Jumps races. The current racetrack&#x27;s grandstand was completed in 2006.

Ascot Racecourse is visited by approximately 600,000 people a year, accounting for 10% of all UK racegoers. The racecourse covers leased from the Crown Estate and enjoys close association with the British Royal Family. Ascot was founded in 1711 by Queen Anne and located approximately from Windsor Castle.

Royal stands have been in use at the sports venue since the late 18th century. The main grandstand has been demolished and rebuilt on many occasions. The first public grandstand was built in 1839 and was again redeveloped over the centuries. Her Majesty Elizabeth II used to visit the Ascot Racecourse quite frequently, and the seating area was reconstructed in 1961 and named in her honour, but the stand was demolished and replaced from 2004.

Ascot currently stages 26 days of racing over the course of the year, comprising 18 flat meetings between April and October, and 8 jump meetings between October and March. The Royal Meeting, held in June each year, remains the highlight of the British summer social calendar attracting over 350,000 spectators for the week. The prestigious King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes is run over the course in July.

==History==

Over its 300-year history, Ascot has established itself as a national institution, with Royal Ascot being the centerpiece of the British summer social calendar and the ultimate stage for the best racehorses in the world.

The racecourse was founded in 1711 by Queen Anne. When out riding from Windsor Castle, she came upon an area of open heath that looked, in her words, &#x27;ideal for horses to gallop at full stretch&#x27;. Her plans for a new race meeting were subsequently announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 12 July 1711.

That first meeting was held on 11 August 1711, the original date (and a race scheduled for 6 August) having been postponed for reasons unspecified, although it has been speculated that the course was simply not ready. The Queen and a &quot;brilliant suite&quot; drove from Windsor Castle to witness it, with the first race being a seven horse £50 plate, won by a horse called Doctor owned by the Duke of St Albans. The original racecourse was laid out by William Lowen for the first meet.

Queen Anne&#x27;s gift to racing, founding the Royal Racecourse, is marked by the tradition of opening Royal Ascot with The Queen Anne Stakes run over the straight mile.

The first permanent building was not erected until 1793, and was built by local Windsor builder George Slingsby. Holding 1,650 people, it was used for almost fifty years. In 1813 an Act of Parliament ensured that the Ascot Heath would be kept and used as a racecourse for the public in the future, securing racing at Ascot for future generations. A new grandstand was opened in 1839 at a cost of £10,000.


The administration of the Royal Racecourse is handled on behalf of the Crown by a representative appointed by the Monarch. Up until 1901, the racecourse was managed by the Master of the Royal Buckhounds. Lord Churchill was appointed His Majesty&#x27;s Representative in 1901, responsible for running the course and determining entrance to the Royal Enclosure. The Ascot Authority was established in 1913 by a further Act of Parliament, the Ascot Authority Act 1913 (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. lxxxiv), with His Majesty&#x27;s Representative becoming Senior Trustee. Today, as Ascot Authority (Holdings) Limited, Ascot has a formal board chaired by Sir Francis Brooke Bt. who also serves as Her Majesty&#x27;s Representative (Senior Trustee) at Ascot.

Between 1940 and 1943 racing was not run at Ascot. The racecourse was commandeered by the army with the Grandstand providing accommodation for gunners of the Royal Artillery. Racing resumed on 15 May 1943 with an eight-race card. The first post-war fixture was held on 21 May 1945, when the then 19 years old Princess Elizabeth attended Ascot for the first time. The first National Hunt meeting was held at Ascot in 1965, the course having been established using turf from Hurst Park Racecourse, which closed in 1962.

As an owner and breeder of racehorses, Queen Elizabeth II took a keen interest in racing. The jockeys riding the Queen&#x27;s horses could be identified by her racing colours: purple body with gold braid, scarlet sleeves, and a black velvet cap with gold fringe. The Queen attended the annual Royal Meeting from her Coronation in 1953 to 2021, and traditionally presented The Gold Cup and The Diamond Jubilee Stakes each year. In 2013, The Queen&#x27;s filly, Estimate, triumphed in Ascot&#x27;s showpiece race, The Gold Cup – the first time that The Gold Cup has been won by a reigning monarch.

==Grandstand redevelopments==
===1793- 1800s===
Before the public stand for the seating of spectators was built, there was a Royal Stand and betting stand. The Royal Stand was redeveloped from its original foundation in 1793 and subsequently replaced in 1822 when King George IV commissioned a newly built Royal Enclosure with a royal box. Then, the first public grandstand at the Ascot Racecourse was erected in 1838, seating about 3,000 spectators. Construction continued, and by 1859, the Iron Stand was built, then the Alexandra Stand extension in 1863, and also there was a colonnade entrance built in 1876. Additionally, in 1896, a clock tower was installed.

===1900s===
During the reign of King Edward VII, in the 20th century between 1901-02 the three grandstands were demolished, and the Jockey Club, Royal, and Royal Enclosure Stands were built at a cost £57,636 (). Also, the Five Shilling Stand was built in 1908 for the public to attend races at a cheaper price, later known as the Silver Ring Stand, it cost £30,000. Then, in 1926, the Iron Stand was rebuilt, and the Tote Stand was built in 1929, which is still in use today.

====Queen Elizabeth Stand====

From 13 June 1961, the main grandstand consisting of the Victorian Grand, Alexandra and Iron stands were demolished to make way for a new grandstand named the Queen Elizabeth Stand, which could seat 13,000 people. It was completed in the following 11 months at a cost of £1,000,000 (). Also, the Members&#x27; Stand was built in 1964.

===2004===

The Ascot Grandstand was demolished and rebuilt between 20042006 and was closed for a £220 million redevelopment, the single biggest investment in British horse racing. The racecourse was reopened by the Queen on 20 June 2006. The redevelopment was designed by architect firm HOK (Populous), and was engineered by Buro Happold and built by Laing O&#x27;Rourke. The main part of the redevelopment programme was the construction of the 30m x 300m lightweight parasol roof structure of the 480 metre long grandstand for the 30,000 seating arrangement, this was designed and built by Austrian specialist contractor Waagner-Biro. The overall capacity of the grandstand was for 80,000 spectators sitting and standing, and for the racecourse to host over 300,000 attendees during Royal Ascot week. For the 2005 season, the Royal Ascot meet was held at York Racecourse. At the end of 2006, a £10 million programme of further alterations was announced to improve the viewing from lower levels of the grandstand using an innovative steel composite product (&quot;SPS&quot; sandwich plate system) to reprofile the existing concrete terraces.

== The seasons – flat and jumps ==
The first major redevelopment of the racecourse came in 1954, when the straight mile was moved to make more room for spectators. The flat season at Ascot is run from April to October, beginning with Royal Ascot Trials Day and finishing with QIPCO British Champions Day. In all, Ascot hosts 18 days of flat racing each year, totalling roughly 115 flat races each summer. Grass is cut to a regulation 4 inches exactly for flat racing. Ascot hosts 13 Group 1 Flat races each year including the Gold Cup, St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes, King&#x27;s Stand Stakes, Commonwealth Cup and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. British Champions Day holds the greatest number of Group 1 races of any raceday at Ascot with four races at the top level. Ascot has hosted many of the world&#x27;s most famous flat horses including Frankel, Nijinsky, Sagaro, Yeats, Mill Reef, Grundy, Dancing Brave, Swain, Galileo and Enable.

The first jumps fixture was held at Ascot in 1965. The national hunt course, a right handed triangular shaped course like the flat course, is laid out inside the flat track, and is about 1m 5f round, with ten fences, including two in the straight, and six flights of hurdles. The track is famed for being one of the toughest courses with a 73-foot climb from the lowest point, Swinley Bottom, to the highest point, the winning post. Ascot hosts eight days of jumps racing between October and March, starting with the Fireworks Spectacular Family Raceday and finishing with the Spring Family Raceday. Included are both steeplechase and hurdle races, with around 50 jumps races in all being held at Ascot each season. Grass is cut to a regulation 5 inches exactly for jumps racing. Notable jumps races held at Ascot are the Clarence House Chase, Ascot Chase and Long Walk Hurdle, all Grade 1 contests. Ascot has hosted many of the world&#x27;s most famous jumps horses including Arkle, Desert Orchid, Sprinter Sacre, Sire De Grugy, Kauto Star, Cue Card, Baracouda, Thistlecrack, Cyrname and Altior.

==Royal Ascot==
Royal Ascot evolved from the first four-day race meeting held at Ascot in 1768, although the meeting as it is known today only really started to take shape with the introduction of The Gold Cup in 1807. Until 1939, Royal Ascot was the only race meeting held at the racecourse. The Gold Cup remains the feature race of the third day of Royal Ascot, traditionally the busiest day of the week, when high fashion and exquisite millinery take centre stage alongside flat racing&#x27;s most elite stayers. During the racecourse&#x27;s redevelopment in 2005, the Royal Meeting was held at York Racecourse.

Each of the five days of Royal Ascot begins with the Royal Procession at 2pm, when the monarch and other members of the royal family arrive down the straight mile in the Royal Landaus, accompanied by the playing of the National Anthem and the raising of the Royal Standard. This tradition was started in 1825 by King George IV.

Royal Ascot is Britain&#x27;s most valuable race meeting, attracting many of the world&#x27;s finest racehorses to compete for millions of pounds in prize money (just over £7.3million in 2019). Approximately 500 horses race across the five days. Eighteen Group races, eight of them Group 1, are staged each year and are broadcast to audiences in almost 200 territories around the world.

Ascot employees increase by more than 6,500 temporary staff, with over 33,500 items of temporary furniture and 20,000 flowers and shrubs grown especially for the Royal Meeting.

There are four enclosures in total at Royal Ascot, three of them open to the public. The Royal Enclosure is the most prestigious, with access strictly limited. First-time applicants must apply to the Royal Enclosure Office and gain sponsorship from someone who has attended the Royal Enclosure for at least four years. Existing members are sent invitations by His Majesty&#x27;s Representative to request badges each year. Badges are hand written and can only be worn by the named person. Colours of badges vary for each day of the Royal Meeting.

The Royal Enclosure has a very strict dress code, with men wearing grey, navy or black morning dress and top hat, and women wearing formal daywear and a hat with a solid base of 4 inches or more in diameter. The origins of the Royal Ascot dress code can be traced back to the early 19th century when Beau Brummel, a close friend of the Prince Regent, decreed that men of elegance should wear waisted black coats and white cravats with pantaloons to the Royal Meeting.

The Queen Anne Enclosure is Royal Ascot&#x27;s premier public enclosure, granting guests access to the parade ring, grandstand and trackside lawns. Guests in the Queen Anne Enclosure are also invited to participate in the daily tradition of singing around the bandstand after racing. The dress code in the Queen Anne Enclosure is still formal, but more relaxed than that of the Royal Enclosure. Women must dress in a manner that befits a formal occasion and must wear a hat or fascinator at all times. Gentlemen are required to wear a full-length suit with a collared shirt, tie and socks covering the ankle.

The Windsor Enclosure offers a more informal and relaxed atmosphere. There is no formal dress code, but guests are encouraged to wear &quot;smart daywear&quot;—collared shirts and jackets for men, hats or fascinators for women. Guests in the Windsor Enclosure are the first to view the Royal Procession as the enclosure is positioned to the east of the Grandstand along the Straight Mile. The Village Enclosure has been a successful addition since 2017 and is located on the Heath, in the middle of the racecourse. This enclosure, open from the Thursday to Saturday of the Royal Meeting, offers a combination of exciting street food, al fresco dining, live music and unique views of the track and famous Ascot grandstand.

The dress code in the Village Enclosure is similar, but slightly less formal to that of the Queen Anne Enclosure, with women wearing formal daywear and a hat and men wearing jackets, full-length trousers, a tie and socks covering the ankle.

The annual Royal Meeting takes place over five days, each with a unique offering of racing and atmosphere. The week begins on a Tuesday, with the first race traditionally being the Queen Anne Stakes. Two further Group 1 contests normally take place on this day, the King Charles III Stakes and the St James&#x27; Palace Stakes round off the feature races on the card.

The highlight of Wednesday&#x27;s racing is the Group 1 Prince of Wales&#x27;s Stakes, won in 2019 by superstars Crystal Ocean and Frankie Dettori.

On Thursday, the oldest and most prestigious race takes place – the Gold Cup staged over two-and-a-half miles, making it a stiff test for even the world&#x27;s most elite long-distance horses. In 2020, this historic race was taken by reigning champion, Stradivarius, with jockey Frankie Dettori on board, for a third consecutive year. It is also the day where high fashion and millinery masterpieces take centre stage, and has been colloquially termed &quot;Ladies Day&quot;.

The fourth day of the Royal Meeting features two Group 1 races in the Coronation Stakes and the Commonwealth Cup, whilst the final day, Saturday, offers a relaxed and social atmosphere. The quality of racing is no less top-notch, with the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Stakes being the feature race, won in 2019 by Blue Point, who became the first horse since Choisir to win the Diamond Jubilee and King&#x27;s Stand in the same year.

The 2020 meeting was held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== QIPCO King George Diamond Weekend ==
While the grandeur of Royal Ascot takes centre stage in June, Ascot&#x27;s premier summer race actually takes place in July. As Europe&#x27;s midsummer middle-distance showpiece, The King George VI and Queen Elizabeth QIPCO Stakes has seen many champions crowned including legends such as Mill Reef, Dancing Brave, Nashwan, Galileo and Enable. In 2020 Enable made history by becoming the first triple winner of the race having also landed the crown in 2019 following an epic duel with Crystal Ocean and as a three-year-old in 2017. There are also two dual winners to date – Dahlia and Swain.

==British Champions Day==
Since 2011 Ascot has staged QIPCO British Champions Day annually in October, now the culmination of the European elite flat racing season. The great Frankel won The Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Champions Day 2011, and the curtain came down on the career of officially the best horse of all time when he won The Champion Stakes a year later. Sir Henry Cecil&#x27;s pride and joy won five of his 14 races at Ascot in all.

The culmination of the British Champions Series, QIPCO British Champions Day sees the crowning of the Champion Jockey, Champion Apprentice, Champion Trainer and Champion Owner of each year. The day hosts five Group races, four of them being Group 1, providing a truly unique day of quality racing. The meeting also has a strong social atmosphere, with a post-racing after party seeing off the flat season in style. 


==Notable races==
==Shergar Cup==

The Shergar Cup is an annual event, taking place in August, at Ascot since 2000. Named in honour of Shergar, who won the 1981 Epsom Derby, the day was originally sponsored by Shergar&#x27;s owner, the Aga Khan. Now sponsored by Dubai Duty Free, the event attracts approximately 30,000 spectators each year.

The world&#x27;s premier international jockeys competition has four teams: Great Britain and Ireland, Europe, The Rest of The World and The Girls. Teams compete for points in each of the six races in an attempt to win the Shergar Cup, presented to the winning team at the closing ceremony. The Alistair Haggis Silver Saddle is also awarded to the jockey with the most points at the end of the day, with previous winners including Kieren Fallon, Ryan Moore, Sammy Jo Bell and Hayley Turner.

A post racing concert is also held at the Dubai Duty Free Shergar Cup, with previous acts including Rita Ora, Craig David and All Saints.

== Family racedays at Ascot ==
Ascot Racecourse holds four annual family racedays:
* The Spring Family Raceday in March
* The Summer Mile Family Raceday in July
* The Fireworks Spectacular Family Raceday in October or November
* The Christmas Family Raceday in December

Each day hosts a plethora of additional activities for children and aims to promote a love of racing in younger generations.

Ascot Racecourse launched the Colts and Fillies club, a free club for children aged 17 and under, in 2002. It has 20,000 members and promotes making racing more accessible for younger audiences. The club owns a racehorse and organises trips, competitions, days out and special activities on Family Racedays.

== Events outside of horse racing ==
Ascot Racecourse has become a popular venue for events, with 300+ meeting and conference rooms as well as the Grandstand Atrium, with over 4,000 square meters of exhibition space. Many parties and weddings are held at the racecourse every year, including large Asian weddings of up to 1,000 guests.

==Royal Ascot Cricket Club and Ascot United==

The racecourse is also home to Royal Ascot Cricket Club, which was founded in 1883. The club&#x27;s ground is situated in the middle of the racecourse. Ascot United F.C. is located towards the eastern side of the site. A new clubhouse, stand and floodlighting have recently been erected.

==In popular culture==
The 1910 Royal Meeting was the inspiration for Cecil Beaton&#x27;s Ascot Gavotte scene in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), as, following the death of King Edward VII, Royal Ascot became &quot;Black Ascot&quot; with all occupants of the Royal Enclosure &#x27;dressing in black, save for white flowers or strings of pearls&#x27;.

The racecourse has been used for filming many times – most notably three times in James Bond productions, the first being in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), where Bond (played for the last time by Roger Moore) was beginning his mission to defeat Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), whose horse was racing there. The racecourse was used again in &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012) where it stood in for Shanghai Pudong International Airport.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Charles Groves Wright Anderson (12 February 1897 – 11 November 1988) was a South African-born Australian soldier, farmer, and politician. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross and a member of the Australian House of Representatives.

After growing up in Africa and being schooled in England, Anderson served as an officer during the East African campaign against the Germans during the First World War, reaching the rank of captain and being awarded the Military Cross. After the war, Anderson settled as a farmer in Kenya. In the early 1930s, he married an Australian woman and later moved to Australia, where he became a grazier. In 1939, he joined the Militia, Australia&#x27;s part-time military force, before volunteering for overseas service after the outbreak of the Second World War. In early 1941, he was deployed to Malaya as part of the 8th Division, where he rose to command the 2/19th Battalion against the Japanese following their invasion of Malaya in December of that year. For his actions around Muar in January 1942, he was awarded the Victoria Cross before being captured at the end of the fighting on Singapore. He spent over three years in Japanese captivity, before being released at the end of the war.

In the post-war years, Anderson returned to farming and served as a federal parliamentarian, representing the Division of Hume twice between 1949 and 1961, before retiring. He died in Canberra at the age of 91.

==Early life==
Anderson was born on 12 February 1897 in Cape Town, South Africa, to Scottish parents. His father, Alfred Gerald Wright Anderson, an auditor and newspaper editor, had been born in England, while his mother, Emma (Maïa) Louise Antoinette, née Trossaert had been born in Belgium. The middle child of five, when Anderson was three the family moved to Nairobi in Kenya, where his father began farming. He attended a local school until 1907, when his parents sent him to England. He lived with family members until 1910, when he was accepted to attend St Brendan&#x27;s College in Bristol as a boarder.

He remained in England until the outbreak of the First World War. Returning to Kenya, in November 1914, Anderson enlisted as a soldier in the local forces, before later being allocated to the Calcutta Volunteer Battalion as a gunner. On 13 October 1916, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the King&#x27;s African Rifles. He fought with the regiment&#x27;s 3rd Battalion in the East African campaign against the Askari soldiers of the German colonial forces. Anderson was awarded the Military Cross for his service in this campaign.

Following the war, having reached the rank of temporary captain, Anderson was demobilised in February 1919 and lived the life of a gentleman farmer in Kenya, marrying Edith Tout, an Australian, in February 1931. He remained active as a part-time soldier and was promoted to substantive captain in 1932. Two years later the couple moved to Australia where they purchased a grazing property near Young, New South Wales. He joined the Citizens Military Forces in March 1939, being appointed to the 56th Infantry Battalion as a captain. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Anderson was temporarily promoted to the rank of major in October 1939. In June 1940, he volunteered for overseas service by joining the Second Australian Imperial Force.

==Second World War==

In July 1940, Anderson was assigned to the newly formed 2/19th Infantry Battalion, part of the 22nd Brigade, of the 8th Division. Recruited from New South Wales, after training around Ingleburn and then Bathurst, in February 1941 the 22nd Brigade was deployed to Malaya to bolster the garrison there amidst concerns about Japanese intentions in the region.

Holding the rank of major, Anderson was appointed second-in-command of the battalion and due to his experience in jungle warfare, he was placed in charge of training the battalion&#x27;s soldiers to use the jungle as a &quot;friend&quot;. In August he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and took over as commanding officer of the 2/19th. The war in the Pacific began on 7 December 1941 when Japanese landed on the north-east coast of Malaya around Kota Bahru and launched thrusts along the western coast of the Malay Peninsula from Thailand. Initially the 2/19th was not committed to the fighting, but in mid-January, after the Japanese advance had pushed the British Commonwealth troops back to Johore, the 2/19th was detached from the 22nd Brigade and sent to the west coast to support the hard-pressed battalions of &#x27;Westforce&#x27;, an ad hoc formation consisting of Australian and Indian troops.

During the period of 18–22 January 1942 in the Battle of Muar near the Muar River, the 44-year-old Anderson was in command of a small force which destroyed ten enemy tanks. When they were later cut off, Anderson led his force through of enemy-occupied territory, being attacked by air and ground forces all the way. Many times in the journey from Muar to Parit Sulong, Anderson had to lead bayonet charges and hand-to-hand combat against the Japanese.

Anderson is famous for leading the Allied attack in Parit Sulong against the Japanese when the Allies were retreating to Yong Peng to meet up with the main force heading for Singapore. Upon reaching the small town of Parit Sulong on the way, they discovered their way blocked because the main bridge was already in Japanese hands with a Japanese machine gun defending the bridge. They were surrounded and a heavy battle ensued for several days in Parit Sulong. The Allied troops at Yong Peng under Gordon Bennett unsuccessfully attempted to break through the Japanese lines to reinforce Anderson&#x27;s men, but without reinforcements, Anderson and his troops had to try many times to recapture the bridge but was unable to do so. Heavily outnumbered, Anderson&#x27;s Australian and Indian troops were attacked and harassed continuously by Japanese tanks, machine gun, mortar and air attacks and suffered heavy casualties. Yet they held their position for several days and refused to surrender. During the battle, Anderson had tried to evacuate the wounded by using an ambulance, but the Japanese would not let the vehicles pass the bridge.

Although the detachment attempted to fight its way through another of enemy-occupied territory to Yong Peng, this proved impossible, and Anderson had to destroy his equipment and attempted to work his way around the enemy. Anderson then ordered every able man to escape through the jungle to link up with the retreating main force in Yong Peng heading for Singapore. They had no choice but to leave the wounded to be cared for by the enemy, assuming the Japanese would take care of the wounded. But unfortunately, the Japanese unit at Parit Sulong later executed the approximately 150 wounded Australian and Indian soldiers next to the bridge of Parit Sulong, in the Parit Sulong Massacre.

For his brave actions and leadership in Muar and the difficult retreat from Muar to Parit Sulong and the subsequent difficult battle at Parit Sulong led by Anderson, he was awarded the highest and most prestigious decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to British Commonwealth forces.

His VC citation, as listed in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 13 February 1942, states: &quot;...for setting a magnificent example of brave leadership, determination and outstanding courage. He not only showed fighting qualities of very high order but throughout exposed himself to danger without any regard for his own personal safety&quot;.

Following the action around Muar and Parit Sulong, Anderson went to Singapore, as the Allies withdrew across the Causeway to prepare a line of defence. Shortly afterwards he was hospitalised and, as a result, missed the majority of the fighting following the Japanese landings on 8 February 1942. As the situation became desperate, on 13 February, Anderson discharged himself and returned to the heavily mauled 2/19th, by then down to just 180 men from its authorised strength of 900. He led them until the surrender was announced two days later.

Anderson was captured and for the next three years was held as a prisoner of war. He was the chief staff officer under Brigadier Arthur Varley of the 22nd Brigade in A Force – the first contingent of POWs at Changi to voluntarily avail themselves of a Japanese &quot;offer&quot; to move to a new location where they were told there would be abundant food and a healthy climate. In reality the group of 3,000 were shipped to Burma and were used as slave labour to build the 415 km railway link between Nong Pladuk in Thailand and Thanbyuzayat in Burma. Throughout his time in captivity, Anderson worked to mitigate the hardships of other prisoners, leading by personal example and maintaining morale. At the end of the war, Anderson was repatriated back to Australia. His appointment in the army was terminated on 21 December 1945 and he returned to his property in New South Wales.

==Later life==
Charles Anderson entered politics in 1949, winning the Division of Hume in the House of Representatives for the Country Party, with an 18.8% swing. He lost his seat in the 1951 federal election and unsuccessfully stood for Hume at the subsequent 1954 election. However, he regained the seat at the 1955 election and remained in parliament until his defeat at the 1961 election. While in parliament Anderson served as a member of both the joint committee on the Australian Capital Territory and the joint committee on foreign affairs.

Between 1957 and 1960, although he was retired from active military service, Anderson fulfilled the role of honorary colonel of the 4th and 56th Battalions. Anderson owned farming properties around Young, New South Wales, and following his retirement from politics in 1961, moved permanently to Red Hill in Canberra, where he died in 1988. He was survived by three of his four children. There is a memorial stone and plaque for Anderson at Norwood Crematorium, Australian Capital Territory. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, Australia.

==Honours and awards==







In common with other Victoria Cross and George Cross recipients living at the time, after his service in the two world wars Anderson also received both the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal (1953) and the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal (1977). Both of these medals form part of his medal set, which is held by the Australian War Memorial.

<text>In condensed matter physics, scintillation ( ) is the physical process where a material, called a scintillator, emits ultraviolet or visible light under excitation from high energy photons (X-rays or gamma rays) or energetic particles (such as electrons, alpha particles, neutrons, or ions). See scintillator and scintillation counter for practical applications.

==Overview==
Scintillation is an example of luminescence, whereby light of a characteristic spectrum is emitted following the absorption of radiation. The scintillation process can be summarized in three main stages: conversion, transport and energy transfer to the luminescence center, and luminescence. The emitted radiation is usually less energetic than the absorbed radiation, hence scintillation is generally a down-conversion process.

== Conversion processes ==
The first stage of scintillation, conversion, is the process where the energy from the incident radiation is absorbed by the scintillator and highly energetic electrons and holes are created in the material. The energy absorption mechanism by the scintillator depends on the type and energy of radiation involved. For highly energetic photons such as X-rays (0.1 keV &lt; formula_1 &lt; 100 keV) and γ-rays (formula_1 &gt; 100 keV), three types of interactions are responsible for the energy conversion process in scintillation: photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering, and pair production, which only occurs when formula_1 &gt; 1022 keV, i.e. the photon has enough energy to create an electron-positron pair.

These processes have different attenuation coefficients, which depend mainly on the energy of the incident radiation, the average atomic number of the material and the density of the material. Generally the absorption of high energy radiation is described by:

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the intensity of the incident radiation, formula_6 is the thickness of the material, and formula_7 is the linear attenuation coefficient, which is the sum of the attenuation coefficients of the various contributions:

:formula_8

At lower X-ray energies (formula_9 60 keV), the most dominant process is the photoelectric effect, where the photons are fully absorbed by bound electrons in the material, usually core electrons in the K- or L-shell of the atom, and then ejected, leading to the ionization of the host atom. The linear attenuation coefficient contribution for the photoelectric effect is given by:

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the density of the scintillator, formula_12 is the average atomic number, formula_13 is a constant that varies between 3 and 4, and formula_1 is the energy of the photon. At low X-ray energies, scintillator materials with atoms with high atomic numbers and densities are favored for more efficient absorption of the incident radiation.

At higher energies (formula_1 formula_16 60 keV) Compton scattering, the inelastic scattering of photons by bound electrons, often also leading to ionization of the host atom, becomes the more dominant conversion process. The linear attenuation coefficient contribution for Compton scattering is given by:

:formula_17

Unlike the photoelectric effect, the absorption resulting from Compton scattering is independent of the atomic number of the atoms present in the crystal, but linearly on their density.

At γ-ray energies higher than formula_1 &gt; 1022 keV, i.e. energies higher than twice the rest-mass energy of the electron, pair production starts to occur. Pair production is the relativistic phenomenon where the energy of a photon is converted into an electron-positron pair. The created electron and positron will then further interact with the scintillating material to generate energetic electron and holes. The attenuation coefficient contribution for pair production is given by:

:formula_19

where formula_20 is the rest mass of the electron and formula_21 is the speed of light. Hence, at high γ-ray energies, the energy absorption depends both on the density and average atomic number of the scintillator. In addition, unlike for the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering, pair production becomes more probable as the energy of the incident photons increases, and pair production becomes the most dominant conversion process above formula_1~ 8 MeV.

The formula_23 term includes other (minor) contributions, such as Rayleigh (coherent) scattering at low energies and photonuclear reactions at very high energies, which also contribute to the conversion, however the contribution from Rayleigh scattering is almost negligible and photonuclear reactions become relevant only at very high energies.

After the energy of the incident radiation is absorbed and converted into so-called hot electrons and holes in the material, these energetic charge carriers will interact with other particles and quasi-particles in the scintillator (electrons, plasmons, phonons), leading to an &quot;avalanche event&quot;, where a great number of secondary electron–hole pairs are produced until the hot electrons and holes have lost sufficient energy. The large number of electrons and holes that result from this process will then undergo thermalization, i.e. dissipation of part of their energy through interaction with phonons in the material

The resulting large number of energetic charge carriers will then undergo further energy dissipation called thermalization. This occurs via interaction with phonons for electrons and Auger processes for holes.

The average timescale for conversion, including energy absorption and thermalization has been estimated to be in the order of 1 ps, which is much faster than the average decay time in photoluminescence.

== Charge transport of excited carriers ==
The second stage of scintillation is the charge transport of thermalized electrons and holes towards luminescence centers and the energy transfer to the atoms involved in the luminescence process. In this stage, the large number of electrons and holes that have been generated during the conversion process, migrate inside the material. This is probably one of the most critical phases of scintillation, since it is generally in this stage where most loss of efficiency occur due to effects such as trapping or non-radiative recombination. These are mainly caused by the presence of defects in the scintillator crystal, such as impurities, ionic vacancies, and grain boundaries. The charge transport can also become a bottleneck for the timing of the scintillation process. The charge transport phase is also one of the least understood parts of scintillation and depends strongly on the type material involved and its intrinsic charge conduction properties.

==Luminescence==
Once the electrons and holes reach the luminescence centers, the third and final stage of scintillation occurs: luminescence. In this stage the electrons and holes are captured potential paths by the luminescent center, and then the electrons and hole recombine radiatively. The exact details of the luminescence phase also depend on the type of material used for scintillation.

=== Inorganic crystals ===
For photons such as gamma rays, thallium activated NaI crystals (NaI(Tl)) are often used. For a faster response (but only 5% of the output) CsF crystals can be used.

=== Organic scintillators ===
In organic molecules scintillation is a product of π-orbitals. Organic materials form molecular crystals where the molecules are loosely bound by Van der Waals forces. The ground state of 12C is 1s2 2s2 2p2. In valence bond theory, when carbon forms compounds, one of the 2s electrons is excited into the 2p state resulting in a configuration of 1s2 2s1 2p3. To describe the different valencies of carbon, the four valence electron orbitals, one 2s and three 2p, are considered to be mixed or hybridized in several alternative configurations. For example, in a tetrahedral configuration the s and p3 orbitals combine to produce four hybrid orbitals. In another configuration, known as trigonal configuration, one of the p-orbitals (say pz) remains unchanged and three hybrid orbitals are produced by mixing the s, px and py orbitals. The orbitals that are symmetrical about the bonding axes and plane of the molecule (sp2) are known as σ-electrons and the bonds are called σ-bonds. The pz orbital is called a π-orbital. A π-bond occurs when two π-orbitals interact. This occurs when their nodal planes are coplanar.

In certain organic molecules π-orbitals interact to produce a common nodal plane. These form delocalized π-electrons that can be excited by radiation. The de-excitation of the delocalized π-electrons results in luminescence.

The excited states of π-electron systems can be explained by the perimeter free-electron model (Platt 1949). This model is used for describing polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of condensed systems of benzenoid rings in which no C atom belongs to more than two rings and every C atom is on the periphery.

The ring can be approximated as a circle with circumference l. The wave-function of the electron orbital must satisfy the condition of a plane rotator:

:formula_24

The corresponding solutions to the Schrödinger wave equation are:

:formula_25

where q is the orbital ring quantum number; the number of nodes of the wave-function. Since the electron can have spin up and spin down and can rotate about the circle in both directions all of the energy levels except the lowest are doubly degenerate.

The above shows the π-electronic energy levels of an organic molecule. Absorption of radiation is followed by molecular vibration to the S1 state. This is followed by a de-excitation to the S0 state called fluorescence. The population of triplet states is also possible by other means. The triplet states decay with a much longer decay time than singlet states, which results in what is called the slow component of the decay process (the fluorescence process is called the fast component). Depending on the particular energy loss of a certain particle (dE/dx), the &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; states are occupied in different proportions. The relative intensities in the light output of these states thus differs for different dE/dx. This property of scintillators allows for pulse shape discrimination: it is possible to identify which particle was detected by looking at the pulse shape. Of course, the difference in shape is visible in the trailing side of the pulse, since it is due to the decay of the excited states.

<text>Scintillation is a fluctuation in the amplitude of a target on a radar display. It is closely related to target glint, or wander, an apparent displacement of the target from its mean position. This effect can be caused by a shift of the effective reflection point on the target, but has other causes as well. The fluctuations can be slow (scan-to-scan) or rapid (pulse-to-pulse).

It appears especially at seaside level.

Scintillation and glint are actually two manifestations of the same phenomenon and are most properly linked to one another in target modeling.

<text>The Ericsson cycle is named after inventor John Ericsson who designed and built many unique heat engines based on various thermodynamic cycles. He is credited with inventing two unique heat engine cycles and developing practical engines based on these cycles. His &quot;first&quot; cycle is now known as the closed Brayton cycle, while his second cycle is what is now called the Ericsson cycle.
Ericsson is one of the few who built open-cycle engines, but he also built closed-cycle ones.

==Ideal Ericsson cycle==

The following is a list of the four processes that occur between the four stages of the ideal Ericsson cycle:
*Process 1 -&gt; 2: Isothermal compression. The compression space is assumed to be intercooled, so the gas undergoes isothermal compression. The compressed air flows into a storage tank at constant pressure. In the ideal cycle, there is no heat transfer across the tank walls.
*Process 2 -&gt; 3: Isobaric heat addition. From the tank, the compressed air flows through the regenerator and picks up heat at a high constant-pressure on the way to the heated power-cylinder.
*Process 3 -&gt; 4: Isothermal expansion. The power-cylinder expansion-space is heated externally, and the gas undergoes isothermal expansion.
*Process 4 -&gt; 1: Isobaric heat removal. Before the air is released as exhaust, it is passed back through the regenerator, thus cooling the gas at a low constant pressure, and heating the regenerator for the next cycle.

===Comparison with Carnot, Diesel, Otto, and Stirling cycles===

The ideal Otto and Diesel cycles are not totally reversible because they involve heat transfer through a finite temperature difference during the irreversible isochoric/isobaric heat-addition and isochoric heat-rejection processes. The aforementioned irreversibility renders the thermal efficiency of these cycles less than that of a Carnot engine operating within the same limits of temperature. Another cycle that features isobaric heat-addition and heat-rejection processes is the Ericsson cycle. The Ericsson cycle is an altered version of the Carnot cycle in which the two isentropic processes featured in the Carnot cycle are replaced by two isothermal regeneration processes.

The Ericsson cycle is often compared with the Stirling cycle, since the engine designs based on these respective cycles are both external combustion engines with regenerators. The Ericsson is perhaps most similar to the so-called &quot;double-acting&quot; type of Stirling engine, in which the displacer piston also acts as the power piston. Theoretically, both of these cycles have so called &quot;ideal&quot; efficiency, which is the highest allowed by the second law of thermodynamics. The most well-known ideal cycle is the Carnot cycle, although a useful &quot;Carnot engine&quot; is not known to have been invented.
The theoretical efficiencies for both, Ericsson and Stirling cycles acting in the same limits are equal to the Carnot Efficiency for same limits.

===Comparison with the Brayton cycle===

The first cycle Ericsson developed is now called the &quot;Brayton cycle&quot;, commonly applied to gas turbine engines.

The second Ericsson cycle is the cycle most commonly referred to as simply the &quot;Ericsson cycle&quot;. The (second) Ericsson cycle is also the limit of an ideal gas-turbine Brayton cycle, operating with multistage intercooled compression, and multistage expansion with reheat and regeneration. Compared to the Brayton cycle which uses adiabatic compression and expansion, the second Ericsson cycle uses isothermal compression and expansion, thus producing more net work per stroke. Also the use of regeneration in the Ericsson cycle increases efficiency by reducing the required heat input. For further comparisons of thermodynamic cycles, see heat engine.

==Ericsson engine==


The Ericsson engine is based on the Ericsson cycle, and is known as an &quot;external combustion engine&quot;, because it is externally heated. To improve efficiency, the engine has a regenerator or recuperator between the compressor and the expander. The engine can be run open- or closed-cycle. Expansion occurs simultaneously with compression, on opposite sides of the piston.

==Regenerator==

Ericsson coined the term &quot;regenerator&quot; for his independent invention of the mixed-flow counter-current heat exchanger. However, Rev. Robert Stirling had invented the same device, prior to Ericsson, so the invention is credited to Stirling. Stirling called it an &quot;economiser&quot; or &quot;economizer&quot;, because it increased the fuel economy of various types of heat processes. The invention was found to be useful, in many other devices and systems, where it became more widely used, since other types of engines became favored over the Stirling engine. The term &quot;regenerator&quot; is now the name given to the component in the Stirling engine.

The term &quot;recuperator&quot; refers to a separated-flow, counter-current heat exchanger. As if this weren&#x27;t confusing enough, a mixed-flow regenerator is sometimes used as a quasi-separated-flow recuperator. This can be done through the use of moving valves, or by a rotating regenerates with fixed baffles, or by the use of other moving parts. When heat is recovered from exhaust gases and used to preheat combustion air, typically the term recuperator is used, because the two flows are separate.

==History==
In 1791, before Ericsson, John Barber proposed a similar engine. The Barber engine used a bellows compressor and a turbine expander, but it lacked a regenerator/recuperator. There are no records of a working Barber engine. Ericsson invented and patented his first engine using an external version of the Brayton cycle in 1833 (number 6409/1833 British). This was 18 years before Joule and 43 years before Brayton. Brayton engines were all piston engines and for the most part, internal combustion versions of the un-recuperated Ericsson engine. The &quot;Brayton cycle&quot; is now known as the gas turbine cycle, which differs from the original &quot;Brayton cycle&quot; in the use of a turbine compressor and expander. The gas turbine cycle is used for all modern gas turbine and turbojet engines, however simple cycle turbines are often recuperated to improve efficiency and these recuperated turbines more closely resemble Ericsson&#x27;s work.

Ericsson eventually abandoned the open cycle in favor of the traditional closed Stirling cycle.

Ericsson&#x27;s engine can easily be modified to operate in a closed-cycle mode, using a second, lower-pressure, cooled container between the original exhaust and intake. In closed cycle, the lower pressure can be significantly above ambient pressure, and He or H2 working gas can be used. Because of the higher pressure difference between the upward and downward movement of the work-piston, specific output can be greater than of a valveless Stirling engine. The added cost is the valve. Ericsson&#x27;s engine also minimizes mechanical losses: the power necessary for compression does not go through crank-bearing frictional losses, but is applied directly from the expansion force. The piston-type Ericsson engine can potentially be the highest efficiency heat engine arrangement ever constructed. Admittedly, this has yet to be proven in practical applications.

Ericsson designed and built a very great number of engines running on various cycles including steam, Stirling, Brayton, externally heated diesel air fluid cycle. He ran his engines on a great variety of fuels including coal and solar heat.

Ericsson was also responsible for an early use of the screw propeller for ship propulsion, in the USS &quot;Princeton&quot;, built in 1842–43.

===Caloric ship &quot;Ericsson&quot;===
In 1851 the Ericsson-cycle engine (the second of the two discussed here) was used to power a 2,000-ton ship, the caloric ship &quot;Ericsson&quot;, and ran flawlessly for 73 hours. The combination engine produced about . It had a combination of four dual-piston engines; the larger expansion piston/cylinder, at in diameter, was perhaps the largest piston ever built. Rumor has it that tables were placed on top of those pistons (obviously in the cool compression chamber, not the hot power chamber) and dinner was served and eaten, while the engine was running at full power. At 6.5 RPM the pressure was limited to . According to the official report it only consumed 4200 kg coal per 24 hours (original target was 8000 kg, which is still better than contemporary steam engines). The one sea trial proved that even though the engine ran well, the ship was underpowered. Some time after the trials, the &quot;Ericsson&quot; sank. When it was raised, the Ericsson-cycle engine was removed and a steam engine took its place. The ship was wrecked when blown aground in November 1892 at the entrance to Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada.

==Today&#x27;s potential==

The Ericsson cycle (and the similar Brayton cycle) receives renewed interest today to extract power from the exhaust heat of gas (and producer gas) engines and solar concentrators. An important advantage of the Ericsson cycle over the widely known Stirling engine is often not recognized : the volume of the heat exchanger does not adversely affect the efficiency.

(...)&quot;despite having significant advantages over the Stirling. Amongst them, it is worth to note that the Ericsson engine heat exchangers are not dead volumes, whereas the Stirling engine heat exchangers designer has to face a difficult compromise between as large heat transfer areas as possible, but as small heat exchanger volumes as possible.&quot;

For medium and large engines the cost of valves can be small compared to this advantage. Turbocompressor plus turbine implementations seem favorable in the MWe range, positive displacement compressor plus turbine for Nx100 kWe power, and positive displacement compressor+expander below 100 kW. With high temperature hydraulic fluid, both the compressor and the expander can be liquid-ring pumps even up to 400 °C, with rotating casing for best efficiency.

<text>WordMARC Composer was a scientifically oriented word processor developed by MARC Software, an offshoot of MARC Analysis Research Corporation (which specialized in high end Finite Element Analysis software for mechanical engineering). It ran originally on minicomputers such as Prime and Digital Equipment Corporation VAX. When the IBM PC emerged as the platform of choice for word processing, WordMARC allowed users to easily move documents from a minicomputer (where they could be easily shared) to PCs.

WordMARC was the creation of Pedro Marcal, who pioneered work in finite element analysis and needed a technical word processor that both supported complex notations and was capable of running on minicomputers and other high-end machines such as Alliant and AT&amp;T.

WordMARC was originally known as MUSE (MARC Universal Screen Editor), but the name was changed because of a trademark conflict with another company when the product was ported to the IBM PC.

==Features==
In comparison with WordPerfect, WordMARC&#x27;s formatting metadata was always hidden. This was considered friendlier to novice users, and less likely to result in mangled documents.

Although it was billed as a WYSIWYG system, it did not provide for display of proportional fonts. It did, however allow the use of proportional fonts by adjusting the margins based on the current text size using an estimated average character width in version 1. Primeword v2 had font character width tables, and were given a utility that could generate them from HP font files.

Advanced features (for its time) included Document Assembly (maintaining each chapter of a book in separate files and combining them for printing or to produce a table of contents or index), automatic paragraph numbering, footnotes, endnotes, support for mixed fonts, multi-level equations and scientific characters.

An early version offered support for Japanese characters. The Unix version of WordMARC supported PostScript.

==Company history==
In 1999 the company became MSC Software and in May was purchased by MacNeal-Schwendler Corp.

<text>Francis George Steiner, FBA (April 23, 1929 – February 3, 2020) was a Franco-American literary critic, essayist, philosopher, novelist and educator. He wrote extensively about the relationship between language, literature and society, as well as the impact of the Holocaust. A 2001 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Steiner as a &quot;polyglot and polymath&quot;.

Among his admirers, Steiner is ranked &quot;among the great minds in today&#x27;s literary world&quot;. English novelist A. S. Byatt described him as a &quot;late, late, late Renaissance man ... a European metaphysician with an instinct for the driving ideas of our time&quot;. Harriet Harvey-Wood, a former literature director of the British Council, described him as a &quot;magnificent lecturer – prophetic and doom-laden [who would] turn up with half a page of scribbled notes, and never refer to them&quot;.

Steiner was Professor of English and Comparative Literature in the University of Geneva (1974–94), Professor of Comparative Literature and Fellow in the University of Oxford (1994–95), Professor of Poetry in Harvard University (2001–02) and an Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge.

==Early life==
Frances George Steiner was born on April 23, 1929, in Paris, to Viennese Jewish parents Else (née Franzos) and Frederick Georg Steiner. He had an elder sister, Ruth Lilian, who was born in Vienna in 1922. Else Steiner was a Viennese grande dame. Frederick Steiner had been a senior lawyer at Austria&#x27;s central bank, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank; in Paris he was an investment banker.

Five years before Steiner&#x27;s birth, his father had moved his family from Austria to France to escape the growing threat of anti-Semitism. He believed that Jews were &quot;endangered guests wherever they went&quot; and equipped his children with languages. Steiner grew up with three mother tongues: German, English, and French; his mother was multilingual and would often &quot;begin a sentence in one language and end it in another&quot;.

When he was six years old, his father, who believed in the importance of classical education, taught him to read the &quot;Iliad&quot; in the original Greek. His mother, for whom &quot;self-pity was nauseating&quot;, helped Steiner overcome a handicap he had been born with, a withered right arm. Instead of allowing him to become left-handed, she insisted he use his right hand as an able-bodied person would.

Steiner&#x27;s first formal education took place at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly in Paris. In 1940, during World War II, Steiner&#x27;s father was in New York City on an economic mission for the French government when the Germans were preparing to invade France, and he got permission for his family to travel to New York. Steiner, his mother, and his sister Lilian, left by ship from Genoa. Within a month of their move, the Nazis occupied Paris, and of the many Jewish children in Steiner&#x27;s class at school, he was one of only two who survived the war. Again his father&#x27;s insight had saved his family, and this made Steiner feel like a survivor, which profoundly influenced his later writings. &quot;My whole life has been about death, remembering and the Holocaust.&quot; Steiner became a &quot;grateful wanderer&quot;, saying that &quot;Trees have roots and I have legs; I owe my life to that.&quot; He spent the rest of his school years at the Lycée Français de New York in Manhattan, and became a United States citizen in 1944.

After high school, Steiner went to the University of Chicago, where he studied literature as well as mathematics and physics, and obtained a BA degree in 1948. This was followed by an MA degree from Harvard University in 1950. He then attended Balliol College, Oxford, on a Rhodes Scholarship.

==Career==
From 1956 to 1958, Steiner was a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He also held a Fulbright professorship in Innsbruck, Austria, from 1958 to 1959. In 1959, he was appointed Gauss Lecturer at Princeton, where he lectured for another two years. He then became a founding fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge in 1961. Steiner was initially not well received at Cambridge by the English faculty. Some disapproved of this charismatic &quot;firebrand with a foreign accent&quot; and questioned the relevance of the Holocaust he constantly referred to in his lectures. Bryan Cheyette, professor of 20th-century literature at the University of Southampton said that at the time, &quot;Britain [...] didn&#x27;t think it had a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz, Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain.&quot; While Steiner received a professorial salary, he was never made a full professor at Cambridge with the right to examine. He had the option of leaving for professorships in the United States, but Steiner&#x27;s father objected, saying that Hitler, who said no one bearing their name would be left in Europe, would then have won. Steiner remained in England because &quot;I&#x27;d do anything rather than face such contempt from my father.&quot; He was elected an Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College in 1969.

After several years as a freelance writer and occasional lecturer, Steiner accepted the post of Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva in 1974; he held this post for 20 years, teaching in four languages. He lived by Goethe&#x27;s maxim that &quot;no monoglot truly knows his own language.&quot; He became professor emeritus in the University of Geneva upon his retirement in 1994 and an Honorary Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, in 1995. He also held the positions of the first Lord Weidenfeld Professor of Comparative European Literature and Fellow of St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 1994 to 1995, and Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University from 2001 to 2002.

Steiner was called &quot;an intelligent and intellectual critic and essayist.&quot; He was active on undergraduate publications while at the University of Chicago and later became a regular contributor of reviews and articles to many journals and newspapers including &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for over thirty years, contributing over two hundred reviews.

While Steiner generally took things very seriously, he also revealed an unexpected deadpan humor: when he was once asked if he had ever read anything trivial as a child, he replied, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

==Views==
Steiner was regarded as a polymath and is often credited with having recast the role of the critic by having explored art and thought unbounded by national frontiers or academic disciplines. He advocated generalisation over specialisation, and insisted that the notion of being literate must encompass knowledge of both arts and sciences. Steiner believed that nationalism is too inherently violent to satisfy the moral prerogative of Judaism, having said &quot;that because of what we are, there are things we can&#x27;t do.&quot;

Among Steiner&#x27;s non-traditional views, in his autobiography titled &quot;Errata&quot; (1997), Steiner related his sympathetic stance towards the use of brothels since his college years at the University of Chicago. As Steiner stated, &quot;My virginity offended Alfie (his college room-mate). He found it ostentatious and vaguely corrupt in a nineteen-year-old... He sniffed the fear in me with disdain. And marched me off to Cicero, Illinois, a town justly ill famed but, by virtue of its name, reassuring to me. There he organized, with casual authority, an initiation as thorough as it was gentle. It is this unlikely gentleness, the caring under circumstances so outwardly crass, that blesses me still.&quot;

Central to Steiner&#x27;s thinking, he stated, &quot;is my astonishment, naïve as it seems to people, that you can use human speech both to love, to build, to forgive, and also to torture, to hate, to destroy and to annihilate.&quot;

Steiner received criticism and support for his views that racism is inherent in everyone and that tolerance is only skin deep. He is reported to have said: &quot;It&#x27;s very easy to sit here, in this room, and say &#x27;racism is horrible&#x27;. But ask me the same thing if a Jamaican family moved next door with six children and they play reggae and rock music all day. Or if an estate agent comes to my house and tells me that because a Jamaican family has moved next door the value of my property has fallen through the floor. Ask me then!&quot;

==Works==
Steiner&#x27;s literary career spanned half a century. He published original essays and books that address the anomalies of contemporary Western culture, issues of language and its &quot;debasement&quot; in the post-Holocaust age. His field was primarily comparative literature, and his work as a critic tended toward exploring cultural and philosophical issues, particularly dealing with translation and the nature of language and literature.

Steiner&#x27;s first published book was &quot;Tolstoy or Dostoevsky: An Essay in Contrast&quot; (1960), which was a study of the different ideas and ideologies of the Russian writers Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky. &quot;The Death of Tragedy&quot; (1961) originated as his doctoral thesis at the University of Oxford and examined literature from the ancient Greeks to the mid-20th century. His best-known book, &quot;After Babel&quot; (1975), was an early and influential contribution to the field of translation studies. It was adapted for television as &quot;The Tongues of Men&quot; (1977), and was the inspiration behind the creation in 1983 of the English avant-rock group News from Babel.

Works of literary fiction by Steiner include four short story collections, &quot;Anno Domini: Three Stories&quot; (1964), &quot;Proofs and Three Parables&quot; (1992), &quot;The Deeps of the Sea&quot; (1996), and &quot;A cinq heures de l&#x27;après-midi&quot; (2008); and his controversial novella, &quot;The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.&quot; (1981). &quot;Portage to San Cristobal&quot;, in which Jewish Nazi hunters find Adolf Hitler (the &quot;A.H.&quot; of the novella&#x27;s title) alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after the end of World War II, explored ideas about the origins of European anti-semitism first expounded by Steiner in his critical work &quot;In Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1971). Steiner has suggested that Nazism was Europe&#x27;s revenge on the Jews for inventing conscience. Cheyette sees Steiner&#x27;s fiction as &quot;an exploratory space where he can think against himself.&quot; It &quot;contrasts its humility and openness with his increasingly closed and orthodox critical work.&quot; Central to it is the survivor&#x27;s &quot;terrible, envy about not being there – having missed the rendezvous with hell&quot;.

&quot;No Passion Spent&quot; (1996) is a collection of essays on topics as diverse as Kierkegaard, Homer in translation, Biblical texts, and Freud&#x27;s dream theory. &quot;Errata: An Examined Life&quot; (1997) is a semi-autobiography, and &quot;Grammars of Creation&quot; (2001), based on Steiner&#x27;s 1990 Gifford Lectures delivered at the University of Glasgow, explores a range of subjects from cosmology to poetry. Steiner&#x27;s last book, &quot;A Long Saturday: Conversations&quot;, was written with Laure Adler; it was published in French in 2014 and in English in 2017.

==Personal life and death==
After his doctoral thesis at Oxford, a draft of &quot;The Death of Tragedy&quot; (later published by Faber and Faber), was rejected, Steiner took time off from his studies to teach English at Williams College and to work as leader writer for the London-based weekly publication &quot;The Economist&quot; between 1952 and 1956. It was during this time that he met Zara Shakow, a New Yorker of Lithuanian descent. She had also studied at Harvard and they met in London at the suggestion of their former professors. &quot;The professors had had a bet ... that we would get married if we ever met.&quot; They married in 1955, the year he received his DPhil from Oxford University. They had a son, David Steiner (who served as New York State&#x27;s Commissioner of Education from 2009 to 2011) and a daughter, Deborah Steiner (Professor of Classics at Columbia University). He last lived in Cambridge, England. He died at home on February 3, 2020, at the age of 90, and Zara Steiner died from pneumonia ten days later.

<doc id="826291" wikidata="Q321298" url="?curid=826291" title="Aegina (mythology)">
<text>Aegina (; ) was a figure of Greek mythology, the nymph of the island that bears her name, Aegina, lying in the Saronic Gulf between Attica and the Peloponnesos. The archaic Temple of Aphaea, the &quot;Invisible Goddess&quot;, on the island was later subsumed by the cult of Athena. &quot;Aphaia&quot; (Ἀφαῖα) may be read as an attribute of Aegina that provides an epithet, or as a doublet of the goddess.

== Family ==
Though the name &quot;Aegina&quot; betokens a goat-nymph, such as was Cretan Amalthea, she was given a mainland identity as the daughter of the river-god Asopus and the nymph Metope; of their twelve or twenty daughters, many were ravished by Apollo or Zeus. Aegina bore at least two children: Menoetius by Actor, and Aeacus by Zeus, both of whom became kings. A certain Damocrateia, who married Menoetius, was also called her daughter by Zeus.

The mortal son Menoetius was king of Opus, and was counted among the Argonauts. His son was Patroclus, Achilles&#x27; first cousin once removed through their paternal family connection to Aegina, and his intimate companion.

The son made immortal, Aeacus, was the king of Aegina, and was known to have contributed help to Poseidon and Apollo in building the walls of Troy. Through him, Aegina was the great-grandmother of Achilles, who was son of Peleus, son of Aeacus.

In one account, Aegina was also called the mother of Sinope by Ares. Otherwise, she was usually her sister; both were daughters of Asopus.

== Mythology ==
===Abduction===
According to Apollodorus and Pindar, Aegina was abducted by Zeus, with Ovid adding that he did so in the form of a flame; he then took her to an island near Attica, then called Oenone, henceforth known by her name. Aegina&#x27;s father Asopus chased after them; his search took him to Corinth, where Sisyphus was king. Sisyphus, having chanced to see a great bird bearing a maiden away to a nearby island, informed Asopus. Though Asopus pursued them, Zeus threw down his thunderbolts sending Asopus back to his own waters. Aegina eventually gave birth to her son Aeacus, who became king of the island.

===Myrmidons===
When the city of Aegina was depopulated by a plague sent by Hera in jealous reprisal for Zeus&#x27;s love of Aegina, the king Aeacus prayed to Zeus for the ants that were currently infesting an oak tree to morph into humans to repopulate his kingdom. Thus the myrmidons were created.

<text>General Sir Hugh Henry Gough ( ; 14 November 1833 – 12 May 1909) was a senior British Indian Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Gough was born into a family of Anglo-Irish gentry in Calcutta, Bengal, India, on 14 November 1833. He was commissioned ensign in the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry in September 1853 aged 19, and was still serving with the Indian Army on the outbreak of the First Indian War of Independence in 1857.

==Victoria Cross==
Gough was 23 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1st Bengal European Light Cavalry (later 19th Hussars) during the 1857 Rebellion, when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC:
==Later career==
Gough commanded the 12th Bengal Cavalry in the 1868 Abyssinian expedition, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in August 1868. He served under General Frederick Roberts during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, including the battles of Peiwar Kotal in December 1878 and Charasia in October 1879. He also commanded the cavalry brigade on Roberts&#x27; march from Kabul to Kandahar in August 1880, and the Battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1881.

After a number of senior military posts in India, Gough achieved the rank of general in 1894. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1896, before retiring a year later. He was then appointed Keeper of the Jewel House at the Tower of London, dying while still holding this office on 12 May 1909. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Family==
General Gough was the third son of Judge George Gough and Charlotte Margaret Becher. He was brother to General Sir Charles Gough, and uncle of the senior First World War commanders General Sir Hubert Gough and Brigadier General Sir John Gough. He was the grandnephew of Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Gough.

Gough married Anne Margaret Hill on 8 September 1863 and they had five sons and four daughters. These included Charlotte Elise Gough (died 17 August 1942), who married Lieutenant General Sir Henry Wilson, by whom she had three children:
*Captain Arthur Henry Maitland Wilson, 12th Cavalry, b 22 January 1885, accidentally killed in Khaniken, Mesopotamia 29 January 1918.
*Hugh Maitland Wilson, 6 April 1886.
*Muriel Maitland Wilson, died unmarried 25 June 1950.

<doc id="826299" wikidata="Q1089000" url="?curid=826299" title="Sarati">
<text>Sarati is an artificial script, one of several scripts created by J. R. R. Tolkien. According to Tolkien&#x27;s mythology, the Sarati alphabet was invented by the Elf Rúmil of Tirion.

== External history ==

As Tolkien strove to create a world that would feel authentic, he realized that for that to be possible, he must invent accompanying scripts for his languages. And, being a perfectionist, he acknowledged that a fully-fledged writing system could not have just appeared out of nowhere. Therefore, he set out to create a series of scripts for the elves as well as for the humans and dwarves that would indicate a certain degree of evolution and development. The first script for the elves was the Sarati which eventually developed into Tengwar by Fëanor. 

Known as the first writing system of Arda, Sarati was in the fiction invented by the Ñoldorin chronicler Rúmil of Valinor in the Valian Year of 1179. It was he &quot;who first achieved fitting signs for the recording of speech and song&quot; The writing system is officially called Sarati as each letter of the script represents a &quot;sarat&quot;. However, Tolkien sometimes called the writing system &quot;The Tengwar of Rúmil&quot;, where the word &quot;tengwar&quot; means &quot;letters&quot; in Quenya. &quot;Sarati&quot; is the Quenya name for Rúmil&#x27;s script.

Upon marrying and getting a job as an assistant on the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, Tolkien began to keep a diary that was written exclusively using the &quot;alphabet of Rúmil&quot;. It has been described as a script that looks like a &quot;mixture of Hebrew, Greek, and Pitman&#x27;s shorthand.&quot;

== Description ==

Each full character represents a consonant, while vowels are represented with diacritics (called tehtar in the terminology associated with the Tengwar). In Sarati, vowel signs are written to the left if the vowel comes before or to the right if after the consonants in horizontal writing. In vertical writing, vowels are written above and below in the same principle. According to Tolkien, consonants were considered more salient than vowels, and vowels were considered merely modifiers. When writing Quenya, the sign for &quot;a&quot; is usually omitted, as it is the most common vowel in Quenya. This makes Sarati an abugida with an inherent vowel of &quot;a&quot;.

=== Consonants ===

In accordance with the leading theory at the time, the consonants were created as the main characters of Sarati, while the role of vowels was secondary and were used to accentuate the consonants. The consonants, more so than the vowels, appear differently throughout the texts. Only the shapes of a select few sarati are stable, varying just slightly. The alterations of the shapes can be mostly attributed to Tolkien&#x27;s constant work on the development of the script.

=== Vowels ===

As mentioned above, the role of the vowels was to emphasize linguistically and, possibly, aesthetically, the consonants of the script. Therefore, the vowels fill the role of diacritics, which can be pronounced either before or after the consonant. The vowel diacritics often can also double the sound or indicate an adjacent &quot;s&quot; or a preceding homorganic nasal.
Though vowel diacritics vary considerably less frequently than the consonants, vowels had undergone considerable changes throughout the years.

== Features ==

As Sarati was created for the Eldar who were ambidextrous, the script can be written right-to-left; left-to-right; top-to-bottom, from the right or left; or boustrophedon (back-and-forth).
When writing from right-to-left, the left hand was employed, whereas when writing left-to-right, the right hand was used. This prevented the accidental smudging of ink, and allowed the writer to see what had just been written. Also, as Sarati was meant to represent an older script, its distinguishing trait of allowing the script to be written in multiple directions is meant to mirror real ancient scripts that are known for their less rigid nature.

While a fair amount of punctuation marks have been created for the script, Sarati has established only two punctuation marks (both of which serve as a full stop) that are used consistently throughout texts. 

Tolkien created a system of Rúmilian numerals for Sarati.

<doc id="826311" wikidata="Q278765" url="?curid=826311" title="Cross-docking">
<text>Cross-docking is a logistical practice of Just-In-Time Scheduling where materials are delivered directly from a manufacturer or a mode of transportation to a customer or another mode of transportation. Cross-docking often aims to minimize overheads related to storing goods between shipments or while awaiting a customer&#x27;s order. This may be done to change the type of conveyance, to sort material intended for different destinations, or to combine material from different origins into transport vehicles (or containers) with the same or similar destinations.

Cross-docking takes place in a distribution docking terminal; usually consisting of trucks and dock doors on two (inbound and outbound) sides with minimal storage space.

In the LTL trucking industry, cross-docking is done by moving cargo from one transport vehicle directly onto another, with minimal or no warehousing. In retail practice, cross-docking operations may utilize staging areas where inbound materials are sorted, consolidated, and stored until the outbound shipment is complete and ready to ship.

== History ==
Cross-dock operations were pioneered in the US trucking industry in the 1930s, and have been in continuous use in less-than-truckload operations ever since. The US military began using cross-docking operations in the 1950s. Wal-Mart began using cross-docking in the retail sector in the late 1980s.

As of 2014 almost half of all US warehouses are cross-docking. 

==Advantages of retail cross-docking==
* Streamlines the supply chain, from point of origin to point of sale 
* Reduces labor costs through less inventory handling 
* Reduces inventory holding costs by reducing storage times and potentially eliminating the need to retain safety stock 
* Products reach the distributor, and consequently the customer, faster 
* Reduces or eliminates warehousing costs 
* May increase available retail sales space
* Less risk of inventory handling
* No need for large warehouse areas
* Easier to screen product quality

==Risks of cross-docking ==
* Fewer suppliers
* Supply chain vulnerability from disruptions
* Reduced storage availability
* An adequate transport fleet is needed to operate
* A computerized logistics system is needed
* Additional freight handling can lead to product damage
* Labor costs are also incurred in the moving and shipping of stock
* Accidentally splitting up shipments larger than a single pallet leading to multiple deliveries or lost items

==Types of cross-docking==
* Full pallet load operation
* Case-load order makeup
* Hybrid cross-docking
* Opportunistic cross-docking
* Truck/rail consolidation
* Short-term storage

==Typical applications==
* &quot;Hub and spoke&quot; arrangements, where materials are brought in to one central location and then sorted for delivery to a variety of destinations
* Consolidation arrangements, where a variety of smaller shipments are combined into one larger shipment for economy of transport
* Deconsolidation arrangements, where large shipments (e.g., railcar lots) are broken down into smaller lots for ease of delivery

Retail cross-dock example: using cross-docking, Wal-Mart was able to effectively leverage its logistical volume into a core strategic competency.
* Wal-Mart operates an extensive satellite network of distribution centers serviced by company-owned trucks
* Wal-Mart&#x27;s satellite network sends point-of-sale (POS) data directly to 4,000 vendors.
* Each register is directly connected to a satellite system sending sales information to Wal-Mart’s headquarters and distribution centers.

==Factors influencing the use of retail cross-docks==
* Cross-docking depends on continuous communication between suppliers, distribution centers, and all points of sale
* Customer and supplier geography, particularly when a single corporate customer has many multiple branches or using points
* Freight costs for the commodities being transported
* Cost of inventory in transit
* Complexity of loads
* Handling methods
* Logistics software integration between supplier(s), vendor, and shipper
* Tracking of inventory in transit

==Products suitable for cross-docking==
* Perishable goods – These are products that are time sensitive like agricultural products and require instant shipping. Other products that use Last In First Out inventory management method may also apply cross docking.
* Staple products – Staple products like staple food, clothes always have a high demand and go through a less storage time. Businesses with these types of products may include them in their cross docking model to reduce storage costs.
* Promotional items – Cross-docking comes in handy for eCommerce platforms that have clearance sale programs.

==Cross-dock facility design==
Cross-dock facilities are generally designed in an &quot;I&quot; configuration, which is an elongated rectangle. The goal in using this shape is to maximize the number of inbound and outbound doors that can be added to the facility while keeping the floor area inside the facility to a minimum. Bartholdi and Gue (2004) demonstrated that this shape is ideal for facilities with 150 doors or less. For facilities with 150–200 doors, a &quot;T&quot; shape is more cost effective. Finally, for facilities with 200 or more doors, the cost-minimizing shape is an &quot;X&quot;.

<doc id="826318" wikidata="Q5094594" url="?curid=826318" title="Cheyenne Mountain Zoo">
<text>The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is a zoological park located southwest of downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Cheyenne Mountain in the United States. At an elevation of above sea level, it is the highest zoo in the country. The zoo covers , 40 of which are in use. The zoo houses more than 750 animals, representing nearly 170 different species, with more than 30 endangered species. The zoo was ranked the #4 best zoo in North America in 2018 by &quot;USA Today&quot;. It is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

==History==
Businessman Spencer Penrose was given a gift of a bear in 1916 which inspired him to collect animals. Animals were housed at Penrose&#x27;s Broadmoor Hotel until a monkey bit a hotel guest. Cheyenne Mountain Zoo was founded in 1926 to house the collection of exotic animals. In 1938, Spencer Penrose incorporated the Zoo as a non-profit public trust. Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization and does not receive local or regional public tax support.

On August 6, 2018, the zoo was hit by fast-moving and unexpected severe weather that brought with it baseball-sized hail. The staff was praised in national media and by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for their use of the incident command system to swiftly move animals and visitors indoors. But just as some humans were confused and didn&#x27;t know where to go, many animals stayed outside in confusion despite having on-exhibit dens as required by the AZA. Three zoo employees were hospitalized following efforts to save animals and guests from the unusually large hail. Several animals were hospitalized as well and five animals (two peafowl, a cape vulture, a Muscovy duck, and a young meerkat pup) died of their injuries.

=== Giraffe herd history ===
Cheyenne Mountain is known for its large and prolific giraffe herd. Two hundred giraffes have been born at the zoo since 1954. The zoo is a trusted source for knowledge on caring for giraffes and it maintains a collection of plasma should other facilities need it. When Dobby the giraffe was born at the Denver Zoo in 2017 without the necessary antibodies for survival, Cheyenne Mountain sent banked giraffe plasma from their herd to Denver. The subsequent blood transfusion was successful and Dobby survived.

In 2022, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo established the International Center for the Care and Conservation of Giraffe. Among other things, it is involved in hosting workshops and offering consulting services to improve and enrich the lives of giraffes in human care.

==Exhibits==

* African Rift Valley is an African savanna themed exhibit containing African crowned cranes, African lions, African spurred tortoises, Colobus monkeys, Grant&#x27;s zebra, griffon vultures, meerkats, okapis, red river hogs, reticulated giraffe, and rock hyrax.

==Conservation==

The zoo breeds endangered animals such as black-footed ferrets, Wyoming toads and Mexican gray wolves. The zoo participates in over 30 Species Survival Plan programs.

In particular, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo has had unique success breeding black-footed ferrets and 647 kits have been born &quot;on the mountain&quot; as of 2024.

The zoo financially supports multiple field conservation programs through Quarters for Conservation which allows guests to choose what programs they want to support. The zoo recently reached $2 million raised through the program since 2008. It also participates in the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation project along with the Houston Zoo, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, and Zoo New England to release endangered amphibian species back to the wild.

<doc id="826320" wikidata="Q6905834" url="?curid=826320" title="Montgomery Zoo">
<text>Montgomery Zoo is a zoo located on the north side of Montgomery, Alabama. The zoo is an independent city department, and is supported in part by The Montgomery Area Zoological Society. It is home to approximately 750 animals representing 140 species. After not renewing their Association of Zoos and Aquariums membership in 2013, the zoo opted to remain accredited solely by the Zoological Association of America. The Mann Wildlife Learning Museum opened in January 2003 and serves as the administration building. The museum features taxidermy displays with a focus on native wildlife, game species, and wildlife management.

==History==

The Montgomery Zoo began as a small menagerie in 1920 in Oak Park in the Oak Park neighborhood, a residential district in Central, Montgomery. Initially started as a small children&#x27;s zoo as a part of a local community park, the zoo housed alligators, monkeys, bears and assorted other animals. There was a small train and carousel for the children. The zoo closed down between 1960 and 1971 due to racial tensions, and an unwillingness to integrate.

In 1972, the Montgomery Zoo reopened at its current location. The zoo began with six acres, a small petting zoo for the children, assorted monkeys, a flight cage designed after the 1906 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, and a chimpanzee named Benji. In 1976, the Montgomery Zoo hosted its first fundraising event entitled Zoo Day. This initial event grew to become an annual event and is now called Zoo Weekend. Today, an average Zoo Weekend will host as many as 18,000 guests.

In 1989, ground-breaking took place expanding the zoo to 40 acres. After two years of construction, the community welcomed a new zoo in 1991. Barrier-free and multi-species exhibits highlighted the expansion, as well as the zoo being divided into five continental realms: Africa, Australia, Asia, North America, and South America. Since then the zoo has continued to grow and expand. In 1992, the cougar and lynx exhibit was opened in North American realm, the Reptile House, jaguar, and ocelot exhibit were completed in South America; and the new chimpanzee and colobus monkey exhibits opened in the Africa realm. In 1993, the Bengal tiger exhibit opened in the Asian realm with one white and one orange tiger. In 1995, the bald eagle exhibit opened in North American realm and Monkey Island was completely renovated in South America. In 1996, the American black bear exhibit opened and the first baby cheetah was born. In 1998, the maned wolf and Indian rhino exhibits opened. In 1999, the new front gate entrance and gift shop opened. In 2003, the Mann Wildlife Learning Museum was completed and opened on zoo property. In 2004, the African elephant exhibit opened, housing three female elephants.

In March 2008, the North American river otter exhibit opened featuring two river otters and an additional habitat for an alligator snapping turtle. In June 2010, the zoo opened the Giraffe Encounter and feeding stations at the river otters and koi fish ponds. The following year, both the Parakeet Cove and Horse Trail Rides were added as animal encounters. In August 2012, the Zoofari Skylift Ride was completed. Two months later, the Birmingham Zoo&#x27;s two male lions, Baron and Vulcan were displayed in their exhibit at the African realm. Two years later, these two lions were sent to Salt Lake City&#x27;s Hogle Zoo to breed with Woodland Park Zoo&#x27;s two lionesses.

The new American alligator habitat opened with four bachelor males in summer 2014.

==Exhibits==

===Australia===
The Australian Realm is viewed from a boardwalk. Although it originally displayed Australian animals, it is currently in a state of redevelopment. This exhibit opened with red kangaroo, dama wallaby, parma wallaby, emu, black swan, cereopsis, radjah shelduck, and magpie goose. The small seasonal exhibit, which formerly housed warthogs and aardwolf, currently houses the red river hog.

Current occupants of this exhibit area include a walk-through interactive aviary for Budgerigar and Pygmy hippopotamus,

===Asia===

One of the central exhibits of the zoo is the large Asian Hoofstock yard. Opened in 1991 with the rest of the ‘new zoo’ this exhibit and its collection have remained mostly unchanged since its construction. The tigers have a view of the hoofstock over a moat. Additionally, Indian peafowl roam the zoo grounds.
*Fallow deer
*Axis deer
*Blackbuck
*Nilgai
*Sarus crane
*Swan goose
The exhibit formerly held Eld’s deer, banteng, demoiselle crane, mandarin duck, common shelduck, and teal. There are additional habitats for the Bengal tiger pair and Indian rhinoceros. The first baby rhino for the zoo was a male born October 1, 2007. The first Indian rhinoceros ever born by artificial insemination was born on June 5, 2013.

===Africa===
The African Realm is the largest exhibit complex in the zoo. The African Savanna Elephant habitat was opened in 2005 with the first three female elephants. It includes waterfalls, a large pool, a barn with a flexible design to allow for the separation of individuals, and several enrichment items scattered across the exhibit that change on a regular basis. The African ungulates and elephants are placed within a panoramic view, and from the cafe all appear to share the same space.

This exhibit displays:
*Bontebok
*Common ostrich
*Eastern bongo
*Egyptian goose
*Grant&#x27;s zebra
*Greater kudu
*Grey crowned crane
*Marabou stork
*Pygmy hippopotamus
*White-backed vulture
Another yard adjacent to the hoofstock houses a family of Reticulated giraffes and Abyssinian ground hornbills. The giraffes can be seen up close and fed from the Overlook Cafe.

The Old World Aviary is also seen from the Overlook Cafe and is adjacent to the giraffe feeding post. It is home to a variety of African birds and a mammal species:

*Blue duiker
*Hammerkop
*Sacred ibis
*Guinea fowl
*Crowned hornbill
*African black duck
The African Realm is also home to the siamang (indigenous to Asia), Chimpanzee, lion, and cheetah.

===South America===
South America is the original and oldest section of the existing zoo. It utilizes what remains of the petting zoo that originally opened at the zoo&#x27;s current location in 1972. The enclosures here are more antiquated, and this section is full of smaller, more traditional, and less modern exhibits.

*Jaguar
*Kori bustard
*Patagonian mara 
*Blue and gold macaw
*Squirrel monkey 
*Ring-Tailed Lemur
*Maned wolf
*Giant anteater

*Scarlet ibis
*Ringed teal 
*Cattle egret
*Great egret
*Turkey vulture
*Snowy egret
*Wood stork
*Wood duck
*Yellow-bellied slider

*Pancake tortoise
*Emerald tree boa
*Dwarf caiman
*Reticulated python
*Solomon Islands skink
*Mossy frog
*Komodo dragon
===North America===

The North American exhibit is full of several species of hoofstock that can be found in Alabama and other parts of the United States.

*White-tailed deer
*Bison
*Wild turkey
*Elk
*Bighorn sheep
*Brown pelican
*Wood duck
There are separate enclosures for the cougar, Canadian lynx, black bear, bald eagle, river otter, and a pair of young American alligators.

==Mann Wildlife Learning Museum==

In 2003, the Mann Wildlife Learning Museum was purchased by the Montgomery Area Zoological Society and moved to the Montgomery Zoo. The collection of large animals on display was taken with bow and arrow by trophy hunter George Mann. Guests visiting the Mann Wildlife Learning Museum are able to touch and feel the furs and antlers of some of the animals on display. The animals are in a three-sided display so you can walk up close and see the animal and their habitat. All the displays are assembled from natural material and actual plants, rocks, trees, dirt and sand collected from the actual site where the display animals lived. There is also a fish room, where many species of mounted fish are on display, including stingrays, sharks, marlin, blue fin and a killer whale.

==Other Attractions==

Feeding stations are located at the Asian koi fish pond. The zoo also has a Giraffe Encounter Post located at the giraffe exhibit in the African realm. Parakeet Cove is an interactive walk-through aviary and was built in 2012. The Zoofari Skylift Adventure Ride opened in 2014, and gives guests an aerial view of the park. The petting zoo features a collection of pygmy goats, ducks, and llamas and is located in the playground area near the Asian realm of the zoo.
The keepers host daily lion and elephant talks and training sessions.

In 2011, the Montgomery Zoo began raising funds for the construction of a touch-and-feed stingray exhibit, where visitors would have a chance to directly interact with stingrays. The exhibit was officially opened on 6 March 2018. Shortly after, a life support system malfunction, that resulted in the loss of much of the marine life, caused for a complete overhaul of the life support systems and backup areas. The newly renovated exhibit opened in Fall 2021, Waters of the World, and features fish, invertebrates, and reptiles found in aquatic habitats all over the world.

The exhibit is adjacent to the Mann Wildlife Learning Museum, and near the Zoo&#x27;s Chimpanzee exhibit.

==Future plans==

Plans are currently being made for a butterfly pavilion to be constructed, in honor of those with breast cancer.

The Zoo is currently raising funds for the construction of a new reptile facility. In cooperation with the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, the Montgomery Zoo has plans to house the endangered species of Indian Crocodile known as the Gharial, along with several other species in the new facility. 2019&#x27;s &quot;Zoo Weekend&quot;, an annual fundraising event hosted by the Zoo since 1976, was solely dedicated to raising funds for this new exhibit. Currently, a large banner providing information of the new facility is hanging on the outside fence of the Greater rhea exhibit, located in the Zoo&#x27;s South America realm. The new facility serves as a replacement for the Zoo&#x27;s current Reptile House, which is also located in the South America realm.

<doc id="826322" wikidata="Q1187723" url="?curid=826322" title="Protestant Cemetery, Rome">
<text>The Non-Catholic Cemetery (), also referred to as the Protestant Cemetery () or the English Cemetery (), is a private cemetery in the rione of Testaccio in Rome. It is near Porta San Paolo and adjacent to the Pyramid of Cestius, a small-scale Egyptian-style pyramid built between 18 and 12 BCE as a tomb and later incorporated into the section of the Aurelian Walls that borders the cemetery. It has Mediterranean cypress, pomegranate and other trees, and a grassy meadow. It is the final resting place of non-Catholics including but not exclusive to Protestants or British people. The earliest known burial is that of a Dr Arthur, a Protestant medical doctor hailing from Edinburgh, in 1716. The English poets John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley, as well as Russian painter Karl Briullov and Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci are buried there.

== History ==
Since the norms of the Catholic Church forbade burying on consecrated ground non-Catholics – including Protestants, Jews and Orthodox – as well as suicides (these, after death, were &quot;expelled&quot; by the Christian community and buried outside the walls or at the extreme edge of the same). Burials occurred at night to avoid manifestations of religious fanaticism and to preserve the safety of those who participated in the funeral rites. An exception was made for Sir Walter Synnot, who managed to bury his daughter in broad daylight in 1821; he was accompanied by a group of guards to be protected from incursions of fanatics.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the area of the non-Catholic cemetery was called &quot;The meadows of the Roman people&quot;. It was an area of public property, where drovers used to graze the cattle, wine was kept in the cavities created in the so-called Monte dei Cocci, an artificial hill where the Romans went to have fun. The area was dominated by the Pyramid of Caius Cestius which for centuries was one of the most visited monuments of the city. It was the non-Catholics themselves who chose those places for their burials, and they were allowed by a decision of the Holy Office, which in 1671 consented that the &quot;non-Catholic Messers&quot; who died in the city were spared a burial in the shameful cemetery of Muro Torto. The first burial of a Protestant was that of a follower of the exiled King James VII and II, named William Arthur, who died in Rome where he had come to escape the repressions following the defeats of the Jacobites in Scotland. Other burials followed, which did not concern only courtiers of King James II, who in the meanwhile had settled in Rome. It is said that in 1732 the treasurer of the King of England, William Ellis, was buried at the foot of the Pyramid. By that time the area had acquired the status of a cemetery of the British, although the people buried there were not only from the United Kingdom.

The cemetery developed without any official recognition and only at the end of 1700 Papal authorities started to take care of it. It was not until the 1820s that the Papal government appointed a custodian to oversee the area and the cemetery functions. The public disinterest was mainly determined by the fact that in the current mentality, where the only burial conceived by the Catholics were the ones happening in a church, the availability of a cemetery that provided non-Catholic burials was not considered a privilege.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, only holly plants grew in the area, and there was no other natural nor artificial protection for the tombs scattered in the countryside, where cattle were grazing, as the cypresses that adorn the cemetery today were planted later on. In 1824 a moat was erected that surrounded the ancient part of the cemetery. In ancient times crosses or inscriptions were forbidden, as in all non-Catholic cemeteries, at least until 1870.

For a long time, there have been common graves divided by nations: Germany, Greece, Sweden and Romania.

As of 2011, the custody and management of the cemetery was entrusted to foreign representatives in Italy.

The great, hundred-year-old cypresses, the green meadow that surrounds part of the tombs, the white pyramid that stands behind the enclosure of Roman walls, together with the cats that walk undisturbed among the tombstones written in all the languages of the world, give to this small cemetery a peculiar aura. As in use in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, there are no photographs on the tombstones.

=== Italians ===
The Non-Catholic Cemetery of Rome is intended for the rest of all non-Catholics, without any distinction of nationality. Because of the scarcity of space, relatively few illustrious Italians are buried there, on the grounds of having expressed in life alternative culture and ideas (&quot;foreign&quot; compared to the dominant one), for the quality of their work, or for any other circumstances for which they were somehow deemed &quot;foreign&quot; in their own country. Among them, the politicians Antonio Gramsci and Emilio Lussu alongside Giorgio Napolitano, the writer and poet Dario Bellezza, the writers Carlo Emilio Gadda and Luce d&#x27;Eramo and a few others. It is rare that new burials are added. On 18 July 2019, the writer Andrea Camilleri was buried here. In 2023, former President of Italy Giorgio Napolitano was buried here.

==Burials==
Nicholas Stanley-Price has published an Inventory of early burials at the Non-Catholic Cemetery.

=== John Keats ===

Keats died in Rome of tuberculosis at the age of 25, and is buried in the cemetery. His epitaph, which does not mention him by name, is by his friends Joseph Severn and Charles Armitage Brown, and reads:
===Percy Bysshe Shelley===

Shelley drowned in 1822 in a sailing accident off the Italian Riviera. When his body washed up upon the shore, a copy of Keats&#x27;s poetry borrowed from Leigh Hunt was discovered in his pocket, doubled back, as though it had been put away in a hurry. He was cremated on the beach near Viareggio by his friends, the poet Lord Byron and the English adventurer Edward John Trelawny. His ashes were sent to the British consulate in Rome, who had them interred in the Protestant Cemetery some months later.

Shelley&#x27;s heart supposedly survived cremation and was snatched out of the flames by Trelawny, who subsequently gave it to Shelley&#x27;s widow, Mary. When Mary Shelley died, the heart was found in her desk wrapped in the manuscript of &quot;Adonais&quot;, the elegy Shelley had written the year before upon the death of Keats, in which the poet urges the traveller, &quot;Go thou to Rome ...&quot;.

Shelley and Mary&#x27;s three-year-old son William was also buried in the Protestant Cemetery.

Shelley&#x27;s heart was finally buried, encased in silver, in 1889, with the son who survived him, Sir Percy Florence Shelley, but his gravestone in the Protestant Cemetery is inscribed: &quot;Cor cordium&quot; (&quot;heart of hearts&quot;), followed by a quotation from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;:

<text>Hermann Emil Louis Fischer (; 9 October 1852 – 15 July 1919) was a German chemist and 1902 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He discovered the Fischer esterification. He also developed the Fischer projection, a symbolic way of drawing asymmetric carbon atoms. He also hypothesized lock and key mechanism of enzyme action. He never used his first given name, and was known throughout his life simply as Emil Fischer.

==Early years and career==
Fischer was born in Euskirchen, near Cologne, the son of Laurenz Fischer, a businessman, and his wife Julie Poensgen. After graduating he wished to study natural sciences, but his father compelled him to work in the family business until determining that his son was unsuitable. Fischer then attended the University of Bonn in 1871, but switched to the University of Strasbourg in 1872. He earned his doctorate in 1874 under Adolf von Baeyer with his study of phthaleins. 

Fischer remained with Baeyer in Strassburg as an independent research student. In the fall of 1874, he was appointed assistant of the organic laboratory. There in 1875, he discovered and named hydrazines, including unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, which became important much later during the Space Race, and phenylhydrazine. The latter compound reacts with carboxylic compounds (aldehydes and ketones) producing crystalline solids. The phenylhydrazones of sugars allowed him to develop his work on the synthesis of sugars and purines, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1902. Using the phenylhydrazone of piruvic acid, he developed the synthesis of indole. 

In 1875, von Baeyer was asked to succeed Justus von Liebig at the University of Munich and Fischer went there with him to become an assistant in organic chemistry. In 1878 Fischer qualified as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Munich, where he was appointed associate professor of analytical chemistry in 1879.

In 1882, he was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Erlangen and in 1885 at the University of Würzburg. In 1892 he succeeded von Hofmann as professor of chemistry at the University of Berlin.

==Research==
He investigated the derivatives of phenylhydriazines, establishing their relation to the diazo compounds, and he noted the readiness with which they entered into combination with other substances, giving origin to a wealth of hitherto unknown compounds. Of such condensation products undoubtedly the most important are the hydrazones, which result from the interaction with aldehydes and ketones. His observations, published in 1886, that such hydrazones, by treatment with hydrochloric acid or zinc chloride, yielded derivatives of indole, the parent substance of indigo, were a confirmation of the views advanced by von Baeyer on the subject of indigo and the many substances related to it.

He next turned to the fuchsine (then called &quot;rosaniline&quot;) magenta dyes, and in collaboration with his cousin Otto Fischer, he published papers in 1878 and 1879 which established that these dyes were derivatives of triphenylmethane. Emil Fischer&#x27;s next research was concerned with compounds related to uric acid. Here the ground had been broken by von Baeyer, but Fischer greatly advanced the field of knowledge of the purines. In 1881 and 1882 he published papers which established the formulae of uric acid, xanthine, caffeine (achieving the first synthesis), theobromine and some other compounds of this group. After purine itself was isolated, a variety of derivatives were prepared, some of which were patented in view of possible therapeutical applications.

Fischer is particularly noted for his work on sugars. Among his early discoveries related to hydrazine was that phenylhydrazine reacted with sugars to form substances which he named osazones, and which, being highly crystalline and readily formed, served to identify such carbohydrates more definitely than had been previously possible. Later, among other work, he is noted for the organic synthesis of -(+)-glucose. He showed how to deduce the formulae of the 16 stereoisomeric glucoses, and prepared several stereoisomerides, helping to confirm the Le Bel–Van &#x27;t Hoff rule of the asymmetric carbon atom.

In the field of enzymology, Fischer is known for his proposal of &quot;the lock and key&quot; model as a mechanism of substrate binding.

Fischer was also instrumental in the discovery of barbiturates, a class of sedative drugs used for insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety, and anesthesia. Along with the physician Josef von Mering, he helped to launch the first barbiturate sedative, barbital, in 1904. He next carried out pioneering work on proteins. By the introduction of new methods, he succeeded in breaking down the complex albumins into amino acids and other nitrogenous compounds, the constitutions of most of which were known, and by bringing about the recombination of these units, he prepared synthetic peptides which approximated to the natural products. His research group synthesised the first free dipeptide (Glycine-Glycine) in 1901. By 1906 about 65 peptides of different chain length and amino acid composition had been made by his research group. His researches made from 1899 to 1906 were published in 1907 with the title &quot;Untersuchungen über Aminosauren, Polypeptides und Proteine&quot;. Three years later the total number of peptides exceeded 100, with the longest being an 18 amino acid peptide containing 15 glycine and three leucine units. The 18 amino acid peptide gave the standard responses to tests for proteins used by physiological chemists - a positive Biuret test, precipitation by inorganic salts and cleavage by proteolytic enzymes

== Personal life and death ==
Fischer married Agnes Gerlach in 1888. She died seven years later, leaving him a widower with three sons. The younger two died during their military service in World War I, but the oldest, Hermann, became an organic chemist. Emil Fischer died in Berlin on 15 July 1919 at the age of 66.

==Honours, awards, and legacy==

In 1897 he put forward the idea to create the International Atomic Weights Commission. Fischer was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1899. He was awarded the 1902 Nobel Prize in chemistry &quot;in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his work on sugar and purine syntheses.&quot; He was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1904, an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1908, and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1909. 

Many names of chemical reactions and concepts are named after him:
* Fischer indole synthesis
* Fischer projection
* Fischer oxazole synthesis
* Fischer peptide synthesis
* Fischer phenylhydrazine and oxazone reaction
* Fischer–Speier esterification
* Fischer glycosidation
* Kiliani–Fischer synthesis
The Fischer–Tropsch process is named after Franz Emil Fischer, who headed the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research in Muelheim, and is unrelated to Fischer.

<doc id="826325" wikidata="Q318461" url="?curid=826325" title="Vasil Levski">
<text>Vasil Levski (, spelled in old Bulgarian orthography as , ), born Vasil Ivanov Kunchev (; 18 July 1837 – 18 February 1873), was a Bulgarian revolutionary who is, today, a national hero of Bulgaria. Dubbed the &quot;Apostle of Freedom&quot;, Levski ideologised and strategised a revolutionary movement to liberate Bulgaria from Ottoman rule. Levski founded the Internal Revolutionary Organisation, and sought to foment a nationwide uprising through a network of secret regional committees.

Born in the Sub-Balkan town of Karlovo to middle-class parents, Levski became an Orthodox monk before emigrating to join the two Bulgarian Legions in Serbia and other Bulgarian revolutionary groups. Abroad, he acquired the nickname &quot;Levski&quot; (&quot;Lionlike&quot;). After working as a teacher in Bulgarian lands, he propagated his views and developed the concept of his Bulgaria-based revolutionary organisation, an innovative idea that superseded the foreign-based detachment strategy of the past. In Romania, Levski helped institute the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee, composed of Bulgarian expatriates. During his tours of Bulgaria, Levski established a wide network of insurrectionary committees. Ottoman authorities, however, captured him at an inn near Lovech and executed him by hanging in Sofia.

Levski looked beyond the act of liberation and envisioned a Bulgarian republic of ethnic and religious equality, largely reflecting the liberal ideas of the French Revolution and contemporary Western society. He said, &quot;We will be free in complete liberty where the Bulgarian lives: in Bulgaria, Thrace, Macedonia; people of whatever ethnicity live in this heaven of ours, they will be equal in rights to the Bulgarian in everything.&quot; Levski held that all religious and ethnic groups live in a free Bulgaria enjoy equal rights. He is commemorated with monuments in Bulgaria and Serbia, and numerous national institutions bear his name. In 2007, he topped a nationwide television poll as the all-time greatest Bulgarian.

==Historical background==

The 19th-century Ottoman Empire&#x27;s economic hardships prompted its personification as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;. The reforms planned by the sultans faced insuperable difficulties. Bulgarian nationalism gradually emerged during the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded popular education, the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards the formation of a separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, in the wake of the Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier merchants and traders, who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize economic stability and widespread rural land ownership.

==Biography==
===Early life, education and monkhood===
Vasil Levski was born Vasil Ivanov Kunchev on 18 July 1837 in the town of Karlovo, within the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s European province of Rumelia. He was the namesake of his maternal uncle, Archimandrite (superior abbot) Vasil (Василий, &quot;Vasiliy&quot;). Levski&#x27;s parents, Ivan Kunchev and Gina Kuncheva (née Karaivanova), came from a family of clergy and craftsmen and were members of the emerging Bulgarian middle class. An eminent but struggling local craftsman, Ivan Kunchev died in 1844. Levski had two younger brothers, Hristo and Petar, and an older sister, Yana; another sister, Maria, died during childhood.
Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later described the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, and a small moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov&#x27;s memories of Levski&#x27;s appearance are supported by Levski&#x27;s contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.

Levski began his education at a school in Karlovo, studying homespun tailoring as a local craftsman&#x27;s apprentice. In 1855, Levski&#x27;s uncle Basil—archimandrite and envoy of the Hilandar monastery—took him to Stara Zagora, where he attended school and worked as Basil&#x27;s servant. Afterward, Levski joined a clerical training course. On 7 December 1858, he became an Orthodox monk in the Sopot monastery under the religious name Ignatius (Игнатий, &quot;Ignatiy&quot;) and was promoted in 1859 to hierodeacon, which later inspired one of Levski&#x27;s informal nicknames, &quot;The Deacon&quot; (Дякона, &quot;Dyakona&quot;).

===First Bulgarian Legion and educational work===
Inspired by Georgi Sava Rakovski&#x27;s revolutionary ideas, Levski left for the Serbian capital Belgrade during the spring of 1862. In Belgrade, Rakovski had been assembling the First Bulgarian Legion, a military detachment formed by Bulgarian volunteers and revolutionary workers seeking the overthrow of Ottoman rule. Abandoning his service as a monk, Levski enlisted as a volunteer. At the time, relations between the Serbs and their Ottoman suzerains were tense. During the Battle of Belgrade in which Turkish forces entered the city, Levski and the Legion distinguished themselves in repelling them.
Further militant conflicts in Belgrade were eventually resolved diplomatically, and the First Bulgarian Legion was disbanded under Ottoman pressure on 12 September 1862. His courage during training and fighting earned him his nickname Levski (&quot;Lionlike&quot;). After the legion&#x27;s disbandment, Levski joined Ilyo Voyvoda&#x27;s detachment at Kragujevac, but returned to Rakovski in Belgrade after discovering that Ilyo&#x27;s plans to invade Bulgaria had failed.
In the spring of 1863, Levski returned to Bulgarian lands after a brief stay in Romania. His uncle Basil reported him as a rebel to the Ottoman authorities, and Levski was imprisoned in Plovdiv for three months, but released due to the help of the doctor R. Petrov and the Russian vice-consul Nayden Gerov. On Easter 1864, Levski officially relinquished his religious office. From May 1864 until March 1866, he worked as a teacher in Voynyagovo near Karlovo; while there, he supported and gave shelter to persecuted Bulgarians and organised patriotic groups among the population. His activity caused suspicion among the Ottoman authorities, and he was forced to move. From the spring of 1866 to the spring of 1867, he taught in Enikyoy and Kongas, two Northern Dobruja villages near Tulcea.

===Hitov&#x27;s detachment and Second Bulgarian Legion===
In November 1866, Levski visited Rakovski in Iaşi. Two revolutionary bands led by Panayot Hitov and Filip Totyu had been inciting the Bulgarian diaspora community in Romania to invade Bulgaria and organise anti-Ottoman resistance. On the recommendation of Rakovski, Vasil Levski was selected as the standard-bearer of Hitov&#x27;s detachment. In April 1867, the band crossed the Danube at Tutrakan, moved through the Ludogorie region and reached the Balkan Mountains. After skirmishing, the band fled to Serbia through Pirot in August.
In Serbia, the government was again favourable towards the Bulgarian revolutionaries&#x27; aspirations and allowed them to establish in Belgrade the Second Bulgarian Legion, an organisation similar to its predecessor and its goals. Levski was a prominent member of the Legion, but between February and April 1868 he suffered from a gastric condition that required surgery. Bedridden, he could not participate in the Legion&#x27;s training. After the Legion was again disbanded under political pressure, Levski attempted to reunite with his compatriots, but was arrested in Zaječar and briefly imprisoned. Upon his release he went to Romania, where Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha were mobilising revolutionary detachments. For various reasons, including his stomach problems and strategic differences, Levski did not participate. In the winter of 1868, he became acquainted with poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev and lived with him in an abandoned windmill near Bucharest.

===Bulgarian tours and work in Romania===
Rejecting the emigrant detachment strategy for internal propaganda, Levski undertook his first tour of the Bulgarian lands to engage all layers of Bulgarian society for a successful revolution. On 11 December 1868, he travelled by steamship from Turnu Măgurele to Istanbul, the starting point of a trek that lasted until 24 February 1869, when Levski returned to Romania. During this canvassing and reconnaissance mission, Levski is thought to have visited Plovdiv, Perushtitsa, Karlovo, Sopot, Kazanlak, Sliven, Tarnovo, Lovech, Pleven and Nikopol, establishing links with local patriots.

After a two-month stay in Bucharest, Vasil Levski returned to Bulgaria for a second tour, lasting from 1 May to 26 August 1869. On this tour he carried proclamations printed in Romania by the political figure Ivan Kasabov. They legitimised Levski as the representative of a Bulgarian provisional government. Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol, Pleven, Karlovo, Plovdiv, Pazardzhik, Perushtitsa, Stara Zagora, Chirpan, Sliven, Lovech, Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Sevlievo and Tryavna. According to some researchers, Levski established the earliest of his secret committees during this tour, but those assumptions are based on uncertain data.
From late August 1869 to May the following year, Levski was active in the Romanian capital Bucharest. He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov, whose participation in the foundation of the Bulgarian Literary Society Levski approved in writing. Karavelov&#x27;s publications gathered a number of followers and initiated the foundation of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), a centralised revolutionary diasporic organisation that included Levski as a founding member and statute drafter. In disagreement over planning, Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and began to put into action his concept of an internal revolutionary network.

===Creation of the Internal Revolutionary Organisation===
Despite insufficient documentation of Levski&#x27;s activities in 1870, it is known that he spent a year and a half establishing a wide network of secret committees in Bulgarian cities and villages. The network, the Internal Revolutionary Organisation (IRO), was centred around the Lovech Central Committee, also called &quot;BRCC in Bulgaria&quot; or the &quot;provisional government&quot;. The goal of the committees was to prepare for a coordinated uprising. The network of committees was at its densest in the central Bulgarian regions, particularly around Sofia, Plovdiv and Stara Zagora. Revolutionary committees were also established in some parts of Macedonia, Dobruja and Strandzha and around the more peripheral urban centres Kyustendil, Vratsa and Vidin. IRO committees purchased armaments and organised detachments of volunteers. According to one study, the organisation had just over 1,000 members in the early 1870s. Most members were intellectuals and traders, though all layers of Bulgarian society were represented.

Individuals obtained IRO membership in secrecy: the initiation ritual involved a formal oath of allegiance over the Gospel or a Christian cross, a gun and a knife; treason was punishable by death, and secret police monitored each member&#x27;s activities. Through clandestine channels of reliable people, relations were maintained with the revolutionary diasporic community. The internal correspondence employed encryption, conventional signs, and fake personal and committee names. Although Levski himself headed the organisation, he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk-turned-revolutionary Matey Preobrazhenski, the adventurous Dimitar Obshti, and the young Angel Kanchev.
Apocryphal and semi-legendary anecdotal stories surround the creation of Levski&#x27;s Internal Revolutionary Organisation. Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture, Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels. For example, he is known to have dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes. In the autumn of 1871, Levski and Angel Kanchev published the &quot;Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People&quot;, a BRCC draft statute containing ideological, organisational and penal sections. It was sent out to the local committees and to the diasporic community for discussion. The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872; at the time, his views on the revolution had clearly matured.

As IRO expanded, it coordinated its activities more with the Bucharest-based BRCC. On Levski&#x27;s initiative, a general assembly was called between 29 April and 4 May 1872. At the assembly, the delegates approved a programme and a statute, elected Lyuben Karavelov as the organisation&#x27;s leader and authorised Levski as the BRCC executive body&#x27;s only legitimate representative in the Bulgarian lands. After attending the assembly, Levski returned to Bulgaria and reorganised IRO&#x27;s internal structure in accordance with BRCC&#x27;s recommendations. Thus, the Lovech Central Committee was reduced to a regular local committee, and the first region-wide revolutionary centres were founded. The lack of funds, however, precipitated the organisation into a crisis, and Levski&#x27;s solitary judgements on important strategic and tactical matters were increasingly questioned.

===Capture and execution===
In that situation, Levski&#x27;s assistant Dimitar Obshti robbed an Ottoman postal convoy in the Arabakonak pass on 22 September 1872, without approval from Levski or the leadership of the movement. While the robbery was successful and provided IRO with 125,000 groschen, Obshti and the other perpetrators were soon arrested. The preliminary investigation and trial revealed the revolutionary organisation&#x27;s size and its close relations with BRCC. Obshti and other prisoners made a full confession and revealed Levski&#x27;s leading role.
Realising that he was in danger, Levski decided to flee to Romania, where he would meet Karavelov and discuss these events. First, however, he had to collect important documentation from the committee archive in Lovech, which would constitute important evidence if seized by the Ottomans. He stayed at the nearby village inn in Kakrina, where he was surprised and arrested on the morning of 27 December 1872. Starting with the writings of Lyuben Karavelov, it was widely accepted that a priest named Krastyo Nikiforov betrayed Levski to the police. This theory has been disputed by the researchers like Ivan Panchovski and Vasil Boyanov for lack of evidence.

Initially taken to Tarnovo for interrogation, Levski was sent to Sofia on 4 January. There, he was taken to trial. While he acknowledged his identity, he did not reveal his accomplices or details related to his organisation, taking full blame. Ottoman authorities sentenced Levski to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out on 18 February 1873 in Sofia, where the Monument to Vasil Levski now stands. The location of Levski&#x27;s grave is uncertain, but in the 1980s, writer Nikolay Haytov campaigned for the Church of St. Petka of the Saddlers as Levski&#x27;s burial place, which the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences concluded as possible yet unverifiable.

Levski&#x27;s death intensified the crisis in the Bulgarian revolutionary movement, and most IRO committees soon disintegrated. Nevertheless, five years after Levski&#x27;s hanging, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 secured the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the wake of the April Uprising of 1876. The Treaty of San Stefano of 3 March 1878 established the Bulgarian state as an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria under &quot;de jure&quot; Ottoman suzerainty.

==Revolutionary theory and ideas==
At the end of the 1860s, Levski developed a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski&#x27;s theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski&#x27;s ideas effectively, such as the use of foreign-based armed detachments (чети, &quot;cheti&quot;) to provoke a general revolt. Levski&#x27;s idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population however—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.
Levski envisioned Bulgaria as a democratic republic, occasionally finding common ground with the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot;, and largely reflecting the liberal ideas of the French Revolution and contemporary Western society. He said, &quot;We will be free in complete liberty where the Bulgarian lives: in Bulgaria, Thrace, Macedonia; people of whatever ethnicity live in this heaven of ours, they will be equal in rights to the Bulgarian in everything. We will have a flag that says, &#x27;Pure and sacred republic&#x27;... It is time, by a single deed, to achieve what our French brothers have been seeking...&quot; Levski held that all religious and ethnic groups in a free Bulgaria—whether Bulgarians, Turks, Jews or others—should enjoy equal rights. He reiterated that the Bulgarian revolutionaries fought against the sultan&#x27;s government, not against the Turkish people and their religion: &quot;We&#x27;re not driving away the Turkish people nor their faith, but the emperor and his laws (in a word, the Turkish government), which has been ruling not only us, but the Turk himself in a barbarian way.&quot;

Levski was prepared to sacrifice his life for the revolution and place Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people above personal interests: &quot;If I shall win, I shall win for the entire people. If I shall lose, I shall lose only myself.&quot; In a liberated Bulgaria, he did not envision himself as a national leader or a high-ranking official: &quot;We yearn to see a free fatherland, and [then] one could even order me to graze the ducks, isn&#x27;t that right?&quot; In the spirit of Garibaldi, Levski planned to assist other oppressed peoples of the world in their liberation once Bulgaria was reestablished. He also advocated &quot;strict and regular accounting&quot; in his revolutionary organisation, and did not tolerate corruption.

==Commemoration==
In cities and villages across Bulgaria, Levski&#x27;s contributions to the liberation movement are commemorated with numerous monuments, and many streets bear his name. Monuments to Levski also exist outside Bulgaria—in Belgrade, Serbia, Dimitrovgrad, Serbia, Parcani, Transnistria, Moldova, Bucharest, Romania, Paris, France, Washington, D.C., United States, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Three museums dedicated to Levski have been organised: one in Karlovo, one in Lovech and one in Kakrina. The Monument to Vasil Levski in Sofia was erected on the site of his execution.

Several institutions in Bulgaria have been named in Vasil Levski&#x27;s honour; these include the football and sports club of Levski Sofia, Levski Sofia (sports club), the Vasil Levski National Sports Academy and the Vasil Levski National Military University. Bulgaria&#x27;s national stadium bears the name Vasil Levski National Stadium. The 1000 Bulgarian leva banknote, in circulation between 1994 and 1999, featured Levski&#x27;s portrait on its obverse side and his monument in Sofia on the reverse. The town of Levski and six villages around the country have also been named in his honour. The Antarctic Place-names Commission of Bulgaria named an Antarctic ridge and peak on Livingston Island of the South Shetland Islands Levski Ridge and Levski Peak respectively.

The life of Vasil Levski has been widely featured in Bulgarian literature and popular culture. Poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev dedicated his last work to Levski, &quot;The Hanging of Vasil Levski&quot;. The poem, an elegy, was probably written in late 1875. Prose and poetry writer Ivan Vazov devoted an ode to the revolutionary. Eponymously titled &quot;Levski&quot;, it was published as part of the cycle &quot;Epic of the Forgotten&quot;. Levski has also inspired works by writers Hristo Smirnenski and Nikolay Haytov, among others. Songs devoted to Levski can be found in the folklore tradition of Macedonia as well. In February 2007, a nationwide poll conducted as part of the &quot;Velikite Balgari&quot; (&quot;The Great Bulgarians&quot;) television show, a local spin-off of &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot;, named Vasil Levski the greatest Bulgarian of all time.

There have been motions to glorify Vasil Levski as a saint of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. However, historian Stefan Chureshki has emphasised that while Levski&#x27;s post-monastical life was one of a martyr, it was incompatible with the Orthodox concept of sainthood. Chureshki makes reference to Levski&#x27;s correspondences, which show that Levski threatened wealthy Bulgarians (чорбаджии, &quot;chorbadzhii&quot;) and traitors with death, endorsed theft from the rich for pragmatic revolutionary purposes and voluntarily gave up his religious office to devote himself to the secular struggle for liberation.

Vasil Levski&#x27;s hanging is observed annually across Bulgaria on 19 February instead of 18 February, due to the erroneous calculation of 19th-century Julian calendar dates after Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916. Although the location of Levski&#x27;s grave has not been determined, some of his hair is on exhibit at the National Museum of Military History. After Levski gave up monkhood in 1863, he shaved his hair, which his mother and later his sister Yana preserved. Levski&#x27;s personal items—such as his silver Christian cross, his copper water vessel, his Gasser revolver, made in Austria-Hungary in 1869, and the shackles from his imprisonment in Sofia—are also exhibited in the military history museum, while Levski&#x27;s sabre can be seen in the Lovech regional museum.

Vasil Levski is referenced by the video game Star Citizen, in which future society &quot;The People&#x27;s Alliance of Levski&quot; adopt an ideology based upon his views.

A pond in the Arbor Hills Nature Preserve in Plano, Texas is named in honor of Vasil Levski.

February 17, 2025 the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, Rumen Radev, officially named Sofia Airport after the Apostle of Freedom, Vasil Levski. The new name “Vasil Levski” – Sofia Airport will be installed on the terminal building.

<text>Bassano del Grappa ( or &quot;Bassan&quot;, ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot;, in the Vicenza province, in the region of Veneto, in northern Italy. It bounds the communes of Cassola, Marostica, Solagna, Pove del Grappa, Romano d&#x27;Ezzelino, Campolongo sul Brenta, Conco, Rosà, Cartigliano and Nove. Some neighbourhoods of these communes have become in practice a part of the urban area of Bassano, so that the population of the whole conurbation totals around 70,000 people.

The 16th century painter Jacopo Bassano was born, worked, and died in Bassano, and took the town name as his own surname.

==History==

===Prehistoric and Roman periods===

The city was founded in the 2nd century BC by a Roman called Bassianus, whence the name, as an agricultural estate. However, an ancient bronze sword (called &quot;spada di Riccardo&quot;), found in 2009
and dating back to the 7th century BC, possibly between the 18th and 15th century BC, suggests that the area of Bassano was already inhabited not just in the pre-Roman period, but possibly even in the pre-Venetic period, as confirmed by some artifacts found in a necropolis located in the neighbourhood of San Giorgio di Angarano.
===From the Middle Ages to Venice===

The first news of the existence of the medieval city dates from 998, while the castle is mentioned first in 1150. In 1175 Bassano was conquered by Vicenza, but the city maintained a semi-autonomous status as a free comune in the 13th century also, when it was home to the family of the Ezzelini, who first unified the various territories of Veneto.

In 1278, according to Giovanni da Nono, Matteo of the Cortusi family of Padua was elected &quot;podestà&quot;. In 1281, the city came under Paduan control. In 1368 Bassano was acquired by the Visconti of Milan and was given the status of &quot;separate land&quot; (&quot;terra separata&quot;).

In 1404, Bassano became a part of the Stato da Tera &#x27;Mainland State&#x27; of the Venetian Republic, which granted the Bassanese district the status of autonomous &quot;podesteria&quot;, &quot;free and separate from whatever city and from the jurisdiction of whatever city&quot; (&quot;sit ipsa terra exempta et separata a quacumque civitate et iurisdictione cuiuscumque civitatis&quot;) and subordinate only to Venice. The autonomous district included Bassano properly and the villas of Cartigliano, Cismon and Primolano, Rossano, San Nazario, Pove, Solagna plus Cassola (on lands previously belonging to Pove and Solagna) and Tezze and Rosà (on lands previously part of Bassano). In addition to this, Valstagna and Campese (then belonging to Vicenza and the Seven Communes) and Romano and Mussolente (then belonging to Treviso) had strong commercial and political ties with the district as they were located very close to Bassano and its port on the river Brenta connected with Venice. In 1760 Doge Francesco Loredan granted Bassano the title of City, subsequently retained under the Austrian and the Italian States. The Serenissima did not alter the town&#x27;s magistratures, limiting itself to impose a Captain chosen by the Venetian Senate. The city became home to a flourishing industry producing wool, silk, iron and copper, and mainly for ceramics; in the 18th became especially famous in all Europe for the presence of the printer company.

===From the fall of Venice to modern times===

During the French Revolutionary Wars the city was the site of the Battle of Bassano. Napoleon Bonaparte remained in Bassano del Grappa for many months. In 1815 it was included in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, and became part of the unified Kingdom of Italy in 1866. 

Until 1928 the name of the town was Bassano Veneto. After the terrible battles on Mount Grappa in World War I, where thousands of soldiers died, a decision was made to change the name of the town. In 1928, the name was changed to Bassano del Grappa, meaning Bassano of Mount Grappa, as a memorial to the soldiers killed.
Ernest Hemingway during his days as an ambulance driver in the war spent many days in Bassano and eventually settled there as part of A Farewell to Arms. Also other American writers spent some days in Bassano during World War I such as Scott Fitzgerald and Dos Passos.

During World War I Bassano was in the front area, and all industrial activities were halted.

In the last days of World War II, Bassano del Grappa was bombed by USAF B-24s and B-17s.

The symbol of the town is the covered Ponte Vecchio, which was designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in 1569. The wooden pontoon bridge was destroyed many times, the last time during World War II. The Alpine soldiers, Alpini, have always revered the wooden bridge and Bassano del Grappa. After the destruction of the bridge, they took up a private collection and had the bridge completely rebuilt. Soldiers often flock to the bridge to remember and sing songs from their days as alpine soldiers. The grappa shop of Nardini Distillery is located on the bridge, known as Ponte degli Alpini.

Bassano del Grappa is also the long residence town of Renzo Rosso, the founder and President of Diesel. Since Diesel began to expand in the mid-1980s, the company has become an important source of business for the city and its surrounding region. As thanks for the support that Rosso has received locally, he has invested personally in the city&#x27;s professional soccer team, Bassano Virtus 55 S.T.

==Geography==
Bassano is located at above sea level and has an area of . Its highest point is at , whereas the lowest point is at . The city lies at the foothills of the Venetian Prealps, where river Brenta comes out the southern end of Canal di Brenta (also called Valbrenta &#x27;Brenta valley&#x27;) and flows in the lowlands at the borders of Vicenza, Treviso and Padua provinces.

==Main sights==

*The cathedral (&quot;Duomo&quot;), built around the year 1000 but renovated in 1417. It has works by Leandro da Bassano, Ottavio Marinali and others
*The &quot;Castello Superiore&quot; (Upper Castle)
*The church of St. John the Baptist, built in the 14th century and restored in the 18th century.
*San Francesco: with a &quot;Crucifix&quot; by Guariento (14th century) and remains of contemporary frescoes. Next to the church is the Town Museum, with ancient archaeological remains, works by Antonio Canova and the Tiepolos, and drawings by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Spagnoletto, Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt
*The wooden covered bridge, built on the Brenta River, known as &quot;Ponte Vecchio&quot; or &quot;Ponte degli Alpini&quot;, was designed in 1569 by the architect Andrea Palladio to replace a pre-existing construction existing from at least 1209. The bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1748, and was rebuilt three years later. The Nardini tavern on the bridge is unchanged since 1779.
*&quot;Palazzo Michieli-Bonato&quot;, with a façade frescoed by Jacopo da Bassano.
*The &quot;Palazzo del Municipio&quot; (Town Hall), erected from 1404. It has a noteworthy loggia and a fresco attributed to Jacopo da Bassano.
*The &quot;Monte di Pietà&quot;, a Renaissance edifice with 15th-century coats of arms.
*The &quot;Palazzo Sturm&quot;, home to the Ceramics Museum
*The &quot;Torre Civica&quot; (Civic Tower, 14th Century) 43 metres, in Piazza Garibaldi.

In the neighbourhood are the &quot;Villa Rezzonico&quot;, designed by Baldassarre Longhena, Art Nouveau&#x27;s &quot;Villa Agnesina&quot;, designed by Francesco Bonfanti in 1923, and the 17th century &quot;Villa Bianchi-Michiel&quot;, with a garden decorated by statues.

== Administrative subdivisions ==
The municipal statute (art.6, par.2) of Bassano, recognizes only Rubbio as frazione and defines Campese, Marchesane, San Michele, Sant&#x27;Eusebio and Valrovina as contrade. The other existing neighbourhoods of Bassano are not mentioned in the statute. However, in practice, all the administrative subdivisions have the same prerogatives and are named quartieri.

=== Frazioni ===
Rubbio is a &quot;frazione&quot; and quartiere located at an altitude of on the Asiago plateau. This hamlet is contiguous with another hamlet, also named Rubbio, which is part of the commune of Conco. Thus, in practice, the two hamlets form one village (named Rubbio), even though they belong to two different communes from the administrative point of view.

=== Contrade ===
Officially, the &quot;contrade&quot; (in ven. &quot;contrae&quot;) are Campese, Marchesane, San Michele, Sant&#x27;Eusebio and Valrovina. From an administrative point of view these are also &quot;quartieri&quot;. However, in practice, some of these neighbourhoods themselves contain smaller inhabited areas (as streets, groups of houses) also called contrade: there are thus contrade within contrade. Besides, some places known as contrade exist also within other neighbourhoods which are officially simply defined as &quot;quartieri&quot;, but not contrade.

=== Quartieri ===
All the administrative subdivisions (&quot;quartieri&quot;) of Bassano are: Centro Storico, Margnan-Conca d&#x27;oro, San Marco, San Vito, Ca&#x27;Baroncello, Quartiere Firenze, Nuovo Ospedale, San Lazzaro, San Fortunato, Borgo Zucco, Marchesane, Rondò Brenta, Angarano, Quartiere XXV Aprile, Sant&#x27;Eusebio, San Michele, Valrovina, Rubbio, Campese, Merlo, Quartiere Pré, Santa Croce.

Rubbio, with an area of 6.835 km2, is the largest &quot;quartiere&quot; of Bassano, but also the least populated (86 inhabitants in 2009).

Quartiere Prè (an old venetian plural meaning &quot;meadows&quot;, the modern ven. plural is &quot;prai&quot;), located in the southern lowland of Bassano, is the second least populated &quot;quartiere&quot; (299 inhabitants in 2009). Part of it hosts an industrial zone that also falls in the nearby San Lazzaro, but it also contains a considerable rural area which falls within the &quot;Parco rurale sovracomunale Civiltà delle Rogge&quot; regional park.

San Vito, in the north-eastern part of Bassano, is the most inhabited &quot;quartiere&quot; (5841 inhabitants in year 2009). It merges with the built-up areas of the bordering comunes Romano d&#x27;Ezzelino, San Giuseppe di Cassola and Pove del Grappa.

=== Territorial variations ===
Until 1928, the official name of Bassano del Grappa was simply Bassano (as it is still informally called today).
In 1878, the neighbourhood of Campese, previously belonging to the commune of Campolongo sul Brenta, was detached from Campolongo and aggregated to Bassano. In 1938, the commune of Valrovina, which also comprised Rubbio, was suppressed and aggregated to Bassano.

<text>The pyramid of Cestius (in Italian, &quot;Piramide di Caio Cestio&quot; or &quot;Piramide Cestia&quot;) is an ancient Roman pyramid in Rome, Italy, near the Porta San Paolo and the Protestant Cemetery. It was built in the style of the Nubian pyramids as a tomb for Gaius Cestius, a member of the Epulones religious corporation. It stands at a fork between two ancient roads, the Via Ostiensis and another road that ran west to the Tiber along the approximate line of the modern Via Marmorata. Due to its incorporation into the city&#x27;s fortifications, it is today one of the best-preserved ancient buildings in Rome.

==Physical attributes==
The pyramid was built about 18–12 BC as a tomb for Gaius Cestius, a magistrate and member of one of the four great religious corporations in Rome, the &quot;Septemviri Epulonum&quot;. It is of brick-faced concrete covered with slabs of white marble standing on a travertine foundation. The pyramid measures 100 Roman feet (29.6 m) square at the base and stands 125 Roman feet (37 m) high.
In the interior is the burial chamber, a simple barrel-vaulted rectangular cavity measuring 5.95 metres long, 4.10 m wide and 4.80 m high. When opened in 1660, the chamber was found to be decorated with frescoes, which were recorded by Pietro Santo Bartoli. Only scant traces of these frescoes survive, and no trace of any other contents. The tomb had been sealed when it was built, with no exterior entrance, but had been plundered at some time thereafter, probably during antiquity. Until the end of restoration works in 2015, it was not possible for visitors to access the interior, except by special permission typically only granted to scholars. Since the beginning of May 2015, the pyramid is open to the public every second and fourth Saturday each month. Visitors must arrange their visit in advance.

==Inscriptions==
A dedicatory inscription is carved on both northwestern and southeastern faces, so as to be visible from both sides. It reads:


Below the inscription only on the southeastern face is a second inscription recording the circumstances of the tomb&#x27;s construction. This reads:

Another inscription on the east face is of modern origins, having been carved on the orders of Pope Alexander VII in 1663. Reading &quot;&quot;, it commemorates excavation and restoration work carried out in and around the tomb between 1660–62.

At the time of its construction, the pyramid of Cestius would have stood in open countryside (tombs being forbidden within the city walls). Rome grew enormously during the imperial period, and, by the 3rd century AD, the pyramid would have been surrounded by buildings. It originally stood in a low-walled enclosure, flanked by statues, columns and other tombs. Two marble bases were found next to the pyramid during excavations in the 1660s, complete with fragments of the bronze statues that originally had stood on their tops. The bases carried an inscription recorded by Bartoli in an engraving of 1697:

This identifies Cestius&#x27; heirs as Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus, a famous general; Publius Rutilius Lupus, an orator whose father of the same name had been consul in 90 BC; and Lucius Junius Silanus, a member of the distinguished &quot;gens&quot; Junia. The heirs had set up the statues and bases using money raised from the sale of valuable cloths (&quot;attalici&quot;). Cestius had stated in his will that the cloths were to be deposited in the tomb, but this practice had been forbidden by a recent edict passed by the aediles.

==History==

The pyramid was built for Gaius Cestius Epulo, the son of Lucius, of the tribe of Pobilia. The inscription on it mentions that Cestius was a &quot;praetor&quot;, a tribune of the plebs, and a &quot;septemvir&quot; of the Epulones. The tomb was completed in 330 days and was one of two pyramid shaped tombs in the city of Rome. Its construction was regulated by sumptuary laws, which limit extreme displays of wealth such as in feasts, clothing, funerals, and tombs. While these laws can be traced back to the mid-5th century BC, they were much more strictly passed and enforced around the time of Cestius’ death.

The sharply pointed shape of the pyramid is strongly reminiscent of the pyramids of Nubia, in particular of the kingdom of Meroë, which had been attacked by Rome in 23 BC. The similarity suggests that Cestius had possibly served in that campaign and perhaps intended the pyramid to serve as a commemoration. His pyramid was not the only one in Rome; a larger one—the &quot;pyramid of Romulus&quot; — of similar form but unknown origins stood between the Vatican and the Mausoleum of Hadrian but was dismantled in the 16th century by Pope Alexander VI and the marble was used for the steps of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.
Some writers have questioned whether the Roman pyramids were modelled on the much less steeply pointed Egyptian pyramids exemplified by the famous pyramids of Giza. However, the relatively shallow Giza-type pyramids were not exclusively used by the Egyptians; steeper pyramids of the Nubian type were favored by the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt that had been brought to an end in the Roman conquest of 30 BC. The pyramid was, in any case, built during a period when Rome was going through a fad for all things Egyptian. The fusion of Roman and Egyptian styles is further highlighted by the fact that the exterior is distinctly &quot;egyptianizing&quot;, while the interior displays classic Roman fresco paintings and a barrel vaulted ceiling. The Circus Maximus was adorned by Augustus with an Egyptian obelisk, and pyramids were built elsewhere in the Roman Empire around this time.
During the construction of the Aurelian Walls between 271 and 275, the pyramid was incorporated into the walls to form a triangular bastion. It was one of many structures in the city to be reused to form part of the new walls, probably to reduce the cost and enable the structure to be built more quickly. It still forms part of a well-preserved stretch of the walls, a short distance from the Porta San Paolo.

The origins of the pyramid were forgotten during the Middle Ages. The inhabitants of Rome came to believe that it was the tomb of Remus (&quot;Meta Remi&quot;) and that its counterpart near the Vatican was the tomb of Romulus, a belief recorded by Petrarch. Its true provenance was clarified by Pope Alexander VII&#x27;s excavations in the 1660s, which cleared the vegetation that had overgrown the pyramid, uncovered the inscriptions on its faces, tunnelled into the tomb&#x27;s burial chamber and found the bases of two bronze statues that had stood alongside the pyramid.
The pyramid was an essential sight for many who undertook the Grand Tour in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was much admired by architects, becoming the primary model for pyramids built in the West during this period. Percy Bysshe Shelley described it as &quot;one keen pyramid with wedge sublime&quot; in &quot;Adonaïs&quot;, his 1821 elegy for John Keats. In turn the English novelist and poet Thomas Hardy saw the pyramid during a visit to the nearby Protestant Cemetery in 1887 and was inspired to write a poem, &quot;Rome: At the Pyramid of Cestius near the Graves of Shelley and Keats&quot;, in which he wondered: &quot;Who, then was Cestius, / and what is he to me?&quot;

In 2001, the pyramid&#x27;s entrance and interior underwent restoration. In 2011, further work was announced to clean and restore the pyramid&#x27;s badly damaged marble cladding, through which water seepage has endangered the frescoes within. The restoration is sponsored by Japanese businessman Yuzo Yagi, whose €1-million donation resulted in a call for tenders to carry out the work issued by the &quot;Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Roma&quot; whose officials drew up the project and are supervising such an intervention along with Italy&#x27;s Ministry of Cultural Heritage. Restoration work started in March 2013.

The pyramid is the namesake of the Piramide station of the Rome Metro.

<text>The white-bellied antbird (Myrmeciza longipes), is a passerine bird in subfamily Thamnophilinae of family Thamnophilidae, the &quot;typical antbirds&quot;. It is found in Panama, on Trinidad, and across northern South America. It is also called Swainson&#x27;s antcatcher (usually in historical sources) after William Swainson, who first described it scientifically.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The white-bellied antbird was described by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1825 and given the binomial name &quot;Drymophila longipes&quot;. It was moved to genus &quot;Myrmeciza&quot; in 1841 by the English zoologist George Robert Gray with it as the type species. The genus formerly included more than 20 species. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that &quot;Myrmeciza&quot;, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, most of the species then in &quot;Myrmeciza&quot; were moved to 12 other genera leaving the white-bellied antbird as only the only member of the genus.

The name &quot;Myrmeciza&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;myrmeco-&quot; (ant) and &quot;-izo&quot; (ambush). The specific epithet also comes from Greek, &quot;longi-&quot; (long) and &quot;-pes&quot; (foot). Both are somewhat inaccurate, as the species is not an obligate army ant follower, does not specialize in eating ants, and does not have unusually long legs.

The white-bellied antbird has these four subspecies:

* &quot;M. l. panamensis&quot; 
* &quot;M. l. longipes&quot; 
* &quot;M. l. boucardi&quot; 
* &quot;M. l. griseipectus&quot; 

Some authors have suggested that some of the subspecies warrant treatment as full species.

==Description==

The white-bellied antbird is about long and weighs an average of about . Adult males of the nominate subspecies &quot;M. l. longipes&quot; have a cinnamon rufous crown, upperparts, wings, and tail. They have a hidden white patch between their scapulars. Their lesser wing coverts have white or pale buff edges and sometimes cinnamon tips. The sides of their head, their throat, and their upper breast are black and bordered with slate gray. Their lower breast and belly are white, their flanks tawny or buffy, and their undertail coverts tawny. Adult females have similar upperparts to males with the addition of black bars near the end of their wing coverts. The sides of their head are dark brown. Their chin is white, their throat and upper breast ochraceous buff, their lower breast and belly white, their flanks ochraceous buff, and their undertail coverts tawny ochraceous. Both sexes&#x27; legs and feet are pinkish gray.

Males of subspecies &quot;M. l. panamensis&quot; have more black and less white on their underparts than the nominate. &quot;M. l. boucardi&quot; males have a gray crown; females are richer ochraceous on their throat and breast than the nominate. &quot;M. l. griseipectus&quot; males have black extending only slightly onto their breast and also large black spots on their wing coverts. Females have more white on their belly than the nominate.

==Distribution and habitat==

The white-bellied antbird has a disjunct distribution. The subspecies are found thus:

* &quot;M. l. panamensis&quot;: Caribbean slope of Panama from Colón Province east, Pacific slope of Panama from Coclé Province east, and northern Colombia from extreme northern Chocó Department east to La Guajira Department
* &quot;M. l. longipes&quot;: from east slope of northeastern Colombia&#x27;s Eastern Andes east through northern Venezuela to Sucre state; Trinidad
* &quot;M. l. boucardi&quot;: upper Magdalena River Valley in central Colombia
* &quot;M. l. griseipectus&quot; : east of the Andes in central Colombia&#x27;s Meta Department, southern and eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and northeastern Brazil north of the Amazon from Roraima east

The white-bellied antbird primarily inhabits the floor and understorey of moderately humid semi-deciduous forest. It also occurs in deciduous forest, small tracts of more humid rainforest, gallery forest, and shrubby secondary forest. In elevation it reaches in Panama, in Colombia, in Venezuela, and in Brazil.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The white-bellied antbird is a year-round resident throughout its range.

===Feeding===

The white-bellied antbird feeds on a variety of insects and probably also spiders. Individuals, pairs, and family groups forage in dense vegetation mostly on the ground and also up to about above it. It captures prey by tossing aside and picking from leaf litter, by reaching to glean vegetation, or by jumping up to the underside of overhanging vegetation. It regularly follows army ant swarms but is not dependent on them. It seldom joins mixed-species feeding flocks.

===Breeding===

The white-bellied antbird&#x27;s breeding season has not been fully defined and appears to vary geographically, but it overall spans at least March to June. It builds a cup nest of twigs and rootlets lined with finer fibers. Its clutch size appears to be two eggs; they are white to creamy white with brown, lilac, or purple markings.
===Vocalization===

The male white-bellied antbird&#x27;s song is &quot;a bright, ringing crescendo of 15-25 loud, rapid &quot;jeer&quot; notes...descending, trailing off, and ending in a few &quot;chew&quot; notes on [the] same pitch&quot;. Females sing a similar though shorter song. The species&#x27; calls include &quot;a short, liquid rattle&quot; and a &quot;long...thin, downslurred whistle, sometimes abbreviated&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the white-bellied antbird as being of Least Concern. It has a large range and an estimated population of at least 500,000 mature individuals. Its population is believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified. It is considered fairly common to common across its range, which includes &quot;numerous parks and reserves in nearly every country&quot;.

<text>Morris Kline (May 1, 1908 – June 10, 1992) was a professor of mathematics, a writer on the history, philosophy, and teaching of mathematics, and also a popularizer of mathematical subjects.

== Education and career ==
Kline was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn and resided in Jamaica, Queens. After graduating from Boys High School in Brooklyn, he studied mathematics at New York University, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1930, a master&#x27;s degree in 1932, and a doctorate (Ph.D.) in 1936. He continued at NYU as an instructor until 1942.

During World War II, Kline was posted to the Signal Corps (United States Army) stationed at Belmar, New Jersey. Designated as a physicist, he worked in the engineering lab where radar was developed. After the war, he continued investigating electromagnetism, and from 1946 to 1966, he was director of the division for electromagnetic research at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Kline resumed his mathematical teaching at NYU, becoming a full professor in 1952.
He taught at New York University until 1975, and wrote many papers and more than a dozen books on various aspects of mathematics and particularly teaching of mathematics. He repeatedly stressed the need to teach the applications and usefulness of mathematics rather than expecting students to enjoy it for its own sake. Similarly, he urged that mathematical research concentrate on solving problems posed in other fields rather than building structures of interest only to other mathematicians.
One can get a sense of Kline&#x27;s views on teaching from the following:

== Critique of mathematics education ==
Morris Kline was a protagonist in the curriculum reform in mathematics education that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century, a period including the programs of the new math. An article by Kline in 1956 in &quot;The Mathematics Teacher&quot; was titled &quot;Mathematical texts and teachers: a tirade&quot;. Calling out teachers who blame students for their failures, he wrote &quot;There is a student problem, but there are also three other factors which are responsible for the present state of mathematical learning, namely, the curricula, the texts, and the teachers.&quot; The tirade touched a nerve, and changes started to happen. But then Kline switched to being a critic of some of the changes. In 1958, he wrote &quot;Ancients versus moderns: a new battle of the books&quot;. The article was accompanied by a rebuttal by Albert E. Meder Jr. of Rutgers University. He says, &quot;I find objectionable: first, vague generalizations, entirely undocumented, concerning views held by &#x27;modernists&#x27;, and second, the inferences drawn from what has not been said by the &#x27;modernists&#x27;.&quot; 
By 1966, Kline proposed an eight-page high school plan. The rebuttal for this article was by James H. Zant; it asserted that Kline had &quot;a general lack of knowledge of what was going on in schools with reference to textbooks, teaching, and curriculum.&quot; Zant criticized Kline&#x27;s writing for &quot;vagueness, distortion of facts, undocumented statements and overgeneralization.&quot;

In 1966 and 1970, Kline issued two further criticisms. In 1973, St. Martin&#x27;s Press contributed to the dialogue by publishing Kline&#x27;s critique, &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Add: the Failure of the New Math&quot;. Its opening chapter is a parody of instruction as students&#x27; intuitions are challenged by the new jargon. The book recapitulates the debates from &quot;Mathematics Teacher&quot;, with Kline conceding some progress: He cites Howard Fehr of Columbia University who sought to unify the subject through its general concepts: sets, operations, mappings, relations, and structures in the Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study.

In 1977, Kline turned to undergraduate university education; he took on the academic mathematics establishment with his &quot;Why the Professor Can&#x27;t Teach: The Dilemma of University Education&quot;. Kline argues that the onus on professors in the United States to conduct research misdirects the scholarly method that characterizes good teaching. He lauds scholarship as expressed by expository writing or reviews of original work of others. For scholarship, he expects critical attitudes to topics, materials and methods. Among the rebuttals are those by D.T. Finkbeiner, Harry Pollard, and Peter Hilton. Pollard conceded, &quot;The society in which learning is admired and pursued for its own sake has disappeared.&quot; The Hilton review was more direct: Kline has &quot;placed in the hand of enemies…[a] weapon&quot;. Having started in 1956 as an agitator for change in mathematics education, he became a critic of some trends. Skilled expositor that he was, editors frequently felt his expressions were best tempered with rebuttal.

In considering what motivated Morris Kline to protest, consider Professor Meder&#x27;s opinion:I am wondering whether in point of fact, Professor Kline really likes mathematics [...] I think that he is at heart a physicist, or perhaps a &#x27;natural philosopher&#x27;, not a mathematician, and that the reason he does not like the proposals for orienting the secondary school college preparatory mathematics curriculum to the diverse needs of the twentieth century by making use of some concepts developed in mathematics in the last hundred years or so is not that this is bad mathematics, but that it minimizes the importance of physics.

It might appear so, as Kline recalls E. H. Moore&#x27;s recommendation to combine science and mathematics at the high school level. But a closer reading shows Kline calling mathematics a &quot;part of man&#x27;s efforts to understand and master his world&quot;, and he sees that role in a broad spectrum of sciences.

== Critique of mathematics research ==
In &quot;&quot; (ch. XIII: &quot;The Isolation of Mathematics&quot;), Kline deplored the way mathematics research was being conducted, complaining that often mathematicians are not willing to become acquainted with the (sometimes deep) context needed to solve applied problems in sciences, and instead prefer to invent pure mathematics problems that are not necessarily of any consequence. Kline also blamed the publish or perish academic culture for this state of affairs.

<doc id="826372" wikidata="Q715893" url="?curid=826372" title="Momir Bulatović">
<text>Momir Bulatović (; 21 September 1956 – 30 June 2019) was a Yugoslav and Montenegrin politician. He was the first president of the Republic of Montenegro from 1990 to 1998, after which he served as the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1998 until 2000, when Slobodan Milošević was overthrown. He was a leader of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro from 1989 to 1997, when he split from DPS after a conflict with Milo Đukanović.

During his mandate as president of Montenegro within Yugoslavia, he oversaw the engagement of Montenegrin reservists in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in the siege of Dubrovnik as well as in the Bosnian War. According to Florence Hartmann, Bulatović was subject to an investigation by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but was not charged. He was a defense witness in the trials of Slobodan Milošević, Radovan Karadžić, and Nikola Šainović at the ICTY.

==Early life==
Bulatović was born in Belgrade as the son of a Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) officer who originated from Montenegro. The family lived in the Voždovac neighbourhood. Due to the nature of his father&#x27;s job his family frequently relocated throughout Yugoslavia. When Momir was five years old, the family moved to Zadar in Croatia, where he completed his primary and secondary education.

In 1975 the 18-year-old Bulatović moved to Titograd to study at the Veljko Vlahović University&#x27;s Faculty of Economics. According to Bulatović, he wanted to return to Belgrade for university studies, but his family did not have enough money to send him there, so he ended up in Titograd.

Upon graduating he continued as an assistant at the same university and soon earned a master&#x27;s degree.

==Anti-bureaucratic revolution (1989)==
In November 1988, while working as an assistant at the Faculty of Economics in Podgorica, Bulatović was named coordinator of the League of Communists of Montenegro. After the anti-bureaucratic revolution in January 1989, Bulatović was promoted to the presidency of the League of Communists of Montenegro.

With the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bulatović became president of Yugoslavia&#x27;s Republic of Montenegro, serving in that position from 23 December 1990 to 15 January 1998. During his tenure, he was a loyal ally to Slobodan Milošević, and oversaw the Montenegrin reserve of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in the Croatian and Bosnian wars. 

In the 1990 Yugoslav Communist party&#x27;s congress, Bulatović supported Milošević&#x27;s agenda of changing the party&#x27;s voting system to a one-member-one-vote system which would give a numerical majority to Serbs. Montenegro also supported Serbia in opposing all reforms proposed by Slovenia that were deemed to be intended to devolve power to the republics. The Slovenian and Croatian communist factions abdicated the party in what they saw as an attempt by Milošević to create Serb hegemony in the party. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia collapsed, Bulatović followed the political changes in the other republics and made Montenegro a multi-party democracy and formed the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) with former communists.

==President of Montenegro (1990–1998)==

===Siege of Dubrovnik (1991)===
On 1 October 1991, Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington came to Titograd and asked Bulatović if Dubrovnik was in danger of an attack by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army. According to testimony by Nikola Samardžić to the ICTY, a member of Bulatović&#x27;s cabinet, Bulatović promised Carrington that Dubrovnik would not be attacked. Just a few hours after meeting Carrington, Bulatović attended a meeting with several generals of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, including Pavle Strugar, after which Bulatović told Samardžić that &quot;30,000 Ustashe are coming from Dubrovnik to seize the Bay of Kotor&quot;, and that a response was urgent. Bulatović ultimately participated in ordering an attempted annexation of Dubrovnik to Montenegro, additionally claiming that it was historically linked to Montenegro. After the war ended, Bulatović claimed that the attack on Dubrovnik was &quot;the only way to prevent the conflict from spreading into Montenegro&quot;, but also asserted that the military gave the government of Montenegro &quot;false information&quot;.

===Carrington&#x27;s proposal (1991)===
The siege of Dubrovnik, in addition to war crimes committed, had enormous consequences for Yugoslavia&#x27;s international standing. The European Economic Community invited Carrington and representatives from Yugoslavia to negotiate a peace accord known as the Carrington plan on 19 October 1991, in The Hague. The proposal of a &quot;loose federation of independent states&quot; was a non-starter for Milošević, who preferred a centralized Yugoslavia with institutional powers in Belgrade. Bulatović, to the shock of Milošević and his own party members, agreed to Carrington&#x27;s terms and even signed a draft of the plan during an overnight session of the Montenegrin parliament on October 17, arguing that it would secure Montenegro&#x27;s interests and end the Yugoslav wars. Bulatović&#x27;s signature potentially guaranteed Montenegro&#x27;s legal right to secede from Yugoslavia, resulting in an almost explosive rift with the Yugoslav leadership in Belgrade. Borisav Jović contacted Bulatović about his support for the Carrington plan in disbelief, asking him if he had been paid off by the Croats, Austrians, or Italians. Bulatović claimed that the Carrington proposal offered Montenegro the Prevlaka peninsula, and that it guaranteed Montenegro would not be subject to sanctions. Furthermore, Montenegro was allegedly offered a large amount of aid from the West with Italian foreign minister Gianni De Michelis telling Bulatović that he &quot;wanted to chart an independent course from Belgrade.&quot; In a follow-up session of the Montenegrin parliament on 24–25 October, parliament and party members ratified Bulatović&#x27;s signature on the Carrington plan, making the accord more imminent.

However, in a sharp turn, the Narodna Stranka (People&#x27;s Party) called for an emergency session in the Montenegrin parliament, during which Bulatović was accused of treason. Milo Đukanović defended Bulatović in the parliamentary hearing. Bulatović tried to make his own case, telling the parliament members &quot;if servility and acceptance of everything coming from Belgrade is the criteria for good governance in Montenegro, then this nation doesn&#x27;t need a government, elections, or political parties.&quot; Subsequently, Bulatović was invited to a meeting with Milošević and Jović in Belgrade; Bulatović described the meeting as &quot;very explosive&quot;. As a result of the meeting, Milošević added a clause to Bulatović&#x27;s Carrington commitment, such that a republic could decide to stay in Yugoslavia through a referendum. This resulted in the 1992 independence referendum, where voters in Montenegro decided to remain in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

=== Muslim communities in Montenegro ===

With the war raging in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulatović faced the first serious threat of &quot;spill-over&quot; in the summer of in 1992, when Muslims in Pljevlja were subject to intimidation and violence. On 6 August 1992, a local warlord named Milika &quot;Čeko&quot; Dačević walked into Pljevlja&#x27;s police headquarters to ask that a vehicle which was seized be returned to his personal envoy, threatening to &quot;declare war&quot; on Pljevlja. Although Bulatović described Dačević as someone &quot;who hardly can be characterized as sane&quot;, over half of the police force turned themselves over to Dačević during his custody, essentially turning over the police station to Dačević&#x27;s militia. In addition to the stand-off with Dačević, his militia included forces of the Kornjača brothers from Čajniče, who helped blocked off the town from a garrison of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). Duško Kornjača threatened to kill all of the Muslims in Pljevlja unless Dačević was released. The militia&#x27;s control over Pljevlja was strong enough that the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army garrison in Pljevlja, composed of only 73 soldiers, refused to confront them. As a result, on 7 August 1992, Bulatović, Đukanović, Dobrica Ćosić and Života Panić came to Pljevlja to negotiate with all parties involved. During the negotiations, a representative of Pljevlja&#x27;s Islamic community named Hakija Ajanović asked Bulatović to tighten border controls to prevent Serbian paramilitaries from Bosnia entering Montenegro. In contrast, Bulatović had been told by the police that &quot;the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina was not possible to secure&quot;. In the end, Bulatović and his colleagues promised the Islamic community in Pljevlja that they would attempt to disarm the paramilitaries and add reinforcements of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army to patrol the town. To satisfy the militia, Bulatović asked the local Muslims not to seek autonomy, although they had not done so over the course of the meeting.

In spite of Bulatović&#x27;s reassurances, Pljevlja&#x27;s Muslim community suffered various incidents, particularly in the village of Bukovica where six Muslim inhabitants were killed from 1992 to 1995. Additionally, the first kidnapping of Muslim inhabitants took place in Pljevlja on February 15, 1993, where Muslim family members were taken to a prison in Čajniče. After a negotiation leading to the release of Serbian reservists held as prisoners by the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulatović announced the freeing of the Bungur family from the Čajniče prison in 1993, crediting Ćosić and Radovan Karadžić &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for the family&#x27;s freedom.

In May 1993, Bulatović participated in the negotiations of the Vance-Owen Plan, held in Athens in the presence of Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis. Bulatović along with Ćosić and Milošević collaborated in pressuring Karadžić to sign the plan. Karadžić eventually signed the plan, after which Bulatović traveled with Ćosić and Milošević to Pale, where they tried to convince wartime Republika Srpska&#x27;s parliament to adopt the resolution signed in Athens. The parliament of Republika Srpska in Pale rejected the resolution in defiance of the Milošević-Ćosić-Bulatović team, and the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued for another two years.

===Loss to Đukanović and departure from DPS===
On 11 July 1997, the national committee (&quot;&quot;Glavni odbor&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;GO&quot;&quot;) of DPS, formerly the League of Communists, held a closed doors session after which the committee selected Milica Pejanović-Đurišić to replace Bulatović as the party president. The party split had enormous implications, making a political confrontation between Đukanović and Bulatović inevitable. This manifested in the 1997 Montenegrin presidential election held in October, which Đukanović won by a thin margin. Although the OSCE recognized the result as legitimate, Bulatović claimed that the United States interfered in Đukanović&#x27;s favor. Bulatović then participated in the mobilization of a large demonstration at Đukanović&#x27;s inauguration in Podgorica on 14 January 1998. The protest at Đukanović&#x27;s inauguration was confronted by the police, resulting in the injury of 44 policemen and four civilians.

On 21 March 1998, Bulatović mobilized a large fraction from DPS CG and helped found the Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro (SNP).

==Prime Minister of Yugoslavia (1998–2000)==
On 21 May 1998, Bulatović was named the new prime minister of Yugoslavia by the country&#x27;s parliament, replacing Đukanović loyalist Radoje Kontić. On 23 March 1999, he signed a declaration of a state of war when NATO began bombing Yugoslavia. He resigned on 9 October 2000, shortly after Milošević was ousted.

==Later life, death and legacy==
Bulatović withdrew from frontline politics in 2001. His son Boško died at the age of 21 on 24 June 2008 after a short illness.

In 2017, Bulatović took part in protests by the pro-Serb opposition in Montenegro against the country&#x27;s NATO membership. He was last seen in public at the funeral of Mirjana Marković in April 2019.

Bulatović died on 30 June 2019 at his family&#x27;s home near Podgorica. A close associate, Milan Knežević, said the former president apparently suffered a heart attack. He was 62. Knežević, an opposition politician, said Bulatović &quot;left a permanent trace in Montenegrin politics as a man who fought for his beliefs until the last day.&quot; Others, including some prosecutors at the ICTY, saw him as one of Milošević&#x27;s partners in crime in the 1990s wars in Yugoslavia.
