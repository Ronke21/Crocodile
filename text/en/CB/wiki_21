<text>The Ford Escape is a compact crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Ford Motor Company since the 2001 model year. The first Ford SUV derived from a car platform, the Escape fell below the Ford Explorer in size; the Escape is currently sized between the Ford EcoSport and Ford Edge. The 2005 model year Ford Escape Hybrid was the first hybrid-electric vehicle from Ford, and the first hybrid produced as an SUV.

The first two generations of the Escape used the Ford CD2 platform (jointly developed with Mazda), leading to the release of the Mazda Tribute and Mercury Mariner; as with the Escape, both the Tribute and Mariner were marketed in North America (the Mariner was never marketed in Canada). In Europe, the Escape was initially branded as the Ford Maverick from 2001 to 2008 (replacing a Nissan-produced SUV).

Under the mid-2000s &quot;One Ford&quot; globalization strategy, the third and fourth-generation designs of the Escape have been unified with the Ford Kuga, designed by Ford of Europe. Sharing a common body and chassis underpinnings (and several engines), the Escape and Kuga are manufactured in their home markets. As with previous generations, the fourth-generation Escape is offered with gasoline, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid options. Outside of North America, the Ford Escape is marketed in Australia, China, and Taiwan.


== First generation (2001) ==

The first generation of Ford Escape was released in 2000 for the 2001 model year. It was jointly developed with Mazda, in which Ford owned a controlling interest, and was released simultaneously with the Mazda Tribute. Although the Escape and Tribute shared the same underpinnings constructed from the Ford CD2 platform (based on Mazda GF underpinnings), the only panels common to the two vehicles were the roof and floor pressings. Powertrains were supplied by Mazda with respect to the base inline-four engine, with Ford providing the optional V6. At first, the twinned models were assembled by Ford in the US for North American consumption, with Mazda in Japan supplying cars for other markets. This followed a long history of Mazda-derived Fords, starting with the Ford Courier in the 1970s.

At the time, larger sport-utility vehicles tended to use pickup truck–based, body-on-frame designs. Other car makers, Jeep, Toyota and Honda had been offering smaller unibody designs, the Jeep Cherokee (XJ), RAV4, and CR-V respectively. Solid rear axles were commonly used on the full-sized truck-based SUVs and Jeep Cherokee due to their ability to carry heavy loads at the expense of a comfortable ride and good handling. Ford and Mazda decided to offer a car-like, unibody design with a fully independent suspension and rack and pinion steering similar to the RAV4 and CR-V in the Escape. Although not meant for serious off-roading, a full-time all-wheel-drive (AWD) system supplied by Dana was optional, which included a locking center differential activated by a switch on the dashboard. The AWD system normally sends most of the power from the engine to the front wheels. If slipping is detected at the front, more power will be sent to the rear wheels in a fraction of a second. The four wheel drive system was a newer version of Ford&#x27;s &quot;Control Trac&quot; 4x4 system, dubbed the Control Trac II 4WD in the Escape. This system allowed the front wheels to receive 100% of the torque until a slip was detected. Using a Rotary Blade Coupling, the rear wheels could be sent up to 100% of the power in fractions of a second. When switching the system from &quot;Auto&quot; to &quot;On,&quot; the front and rear axles are locked at a 50/50 split; the reaction time necessary to engage the rear wheels is reduced via an integrated bypass clutch. The Control Trac II system allows for a four-wheel drive vehicle without the use of a center differential. The entire braking system was built by Continental Teves, including the ABS and various related suspension components.

Ford also sold the first generation Escape in Europe and China as the Ford Maverick, replacing the previous Nissan-sourced model. Then in 2004, for the 2005 model year, Ford&#x27;s Mercury division released a rebadged version called the Mercury Mariner, sold mainly in North America. The first-generation Escape remains notable as the first SUV to offer a hybrid drivetrain option, released in 2004 for the 2005 model year to North American markets only. CKD production began in 2002 at Ford Lio Ho Motor Co. in Taiwan for various Asian markets. One difference between the Tribute and the Ford Escape is that, in an effort to culture a sporty image, the Tribute&#x27;s suspension is tuned for a firmer ride than the Escape.

Mainstream production of the first generation Escape/Tribute ended in late 2006. For Asia-Pacific markets, both received respective facelifts in 2006 and had production fully transferred to Ford Lio Ho in Taiwan. Extended production of the Mazda lasted until 2010, and until 2012 for Ford.

=== Ford Escape ===
==== 2000–2004 (BA, ZA) ====
In North America, it slotted below the larger, truck-based Explorer in Ford&#x27;s lineup, but was marginally larger than the small SUV offerings from Honda and Toyota. Although it is technically a crossover vehicle, it is marketed by Ford as part of its traditional SUV lineup (Escape, Explorer, Expedition) rather than its separate crossover lineup (Edge, Flex) due to its more conventional SUV styling.

From 2001 to 2004, the Ford Escape was sold in Europe under the Maverick name, and replaced a rebadged version of the Nissan Mistral/Terrano II. Only two versions were made, the 2.0 L Zetec inline-4 engine with manual transmission and 3.0 L Duratec V6 with automatic transmission, both using gasoline. The absence of a diesel version did not help sales and the vehicle was temporarily discontinued in late 2003. However, the Maverick, in the UK for example, was only available in XLT trim. Plus, the dashboard was not the same as the US Escape; it was instead taken from the Mazda Tribute. The Maverick was reintroduced in 2005 in certain European markets with the Duratec V6 engine. The Maverick was assembled in Russia for the Russian market. As of 2006, the Maverick was no longer sold in Europe, leaving Ford without a compact SUV until the 2008 Ford Kuga was introduced. The Maverick was primarily designed for on-road use – sold with normal road tires, and to be used with front-wheel drive most of the time.

In the Philippines, Ford introduced the Escape in 2001. It originally came in two grades; &quot;XLS&quot; and &quot;XLT&quot;, but by early 2004, Ford axed the &quot;XLT&quot; (all-wheel drive model) and replaced it with the newly-introduced &quot;V6&quot; trim. The &quot;XLS&quot; is powered by Ford&#x27;s 2.3L Duratec inline-four engine paired to a 4-speed automatic. It came with keyless entry, fabric upholstery, 4 speakers, and six-CD audio system, among other features. The &quot;V6&quot; is powered by Ford&#x27;s 3.0L V6 engine paired to a 4-speed automatic. It featured a power moon roof, leather upholstery, automatic seat adjusters and recliners, keyless entry, and immobilizer.

==== Safety ====
Crash-test results for the Escape have been mixed. In the New Car Assessment Program administered by the US-based National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the car received five out of five stars for driver protection and four out of five stars for passenger protection in a frontal impact. The SUV received five stars for both driver and rear passenger in the side impact test. In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s frontal offset test, 2001–2004 Escapes received a score of &quot;Marginal&quot;. In the side impact crash test, vehicles equipped with the optional side air bags received a score of &quot;Good&quot; in the , while those without the optional air bags received a score of &quot;Poor&quot;.

All Escapes are equipped with a passive &#x27;Immobiliser&#x27; called SecuriLock. This feature includes an RFID chip embedded in the key, which the car reads each time the driver inserts the key. If the key does not provide a valid confirmation signal, the vehicle does not run, even if the key is perfectly cut to match the original. Theft, injury, and collision losses reported to insurance companies for the Escape are among the lowest in its class.

==== North America ====
In the United States, all Escapes included standard equipment such as power windows with an automatic driver-door window, power door locks, anti-lock braking system (ABS), keyless entry, a folding rear-bench seat, 16-inch wheels, and air conditioning. In addition, an Escape buyer could choose from one of several different trim levels that were available, which included:

XLS (2001–2007): As the most basic trim level of the Escape, the XLS included: the 2.0-liter &quot;Zetec&quot; (2001–2004) and the 2.3-liter &quot;Duratec&quot; (2005–2007) engines, a five-speed manual transmission, 15-inch steel wheels, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players (later, just a single-CD player in 2005, adding MP3 capability in 2007 along with SIRIUS) and four speakers, high-back front bucket seats, and cloth-and-vinyl seating surfaces. Options included 15- or 16-inch alloy wheels and the 3.0-liter V6 engine (2001–2004) mated to a four-speed automatic transmission (some of which were available as the XLS Popular Group). Four-wheel drive was not available with the four-cylinder engine for the 2004 model year.

XLT (2001–2007): As the top-of-the-line trim level of the Escape for 2001, and the most popular trim level of the Escape throughout its entire run (2001–2007), the XLT added the following equipment to the base XLS trim level: 16-inch alloy wheels, security alarm, cloth seating surfaces, and an enhanced interior. Options included an AM/FM stereo with a six-disc, in-dash CD changer (which later became standard equipment on all Escapes), a power sunroof, leather-and-vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, and the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer. All 2002–2007 XLT and higher models came with a four-speed automatic transmission, with such models from 2002 to 2004 also coming standard with the 3.0-liter V6 engine.

XLT Sport (2002–2007): The XLT Sport was one of the more popular trim levels of the Escape from 2002 to 2007. It included all standard XLT equipment, plus V6 engine, automatic transmission, sport interior trim, and 16-inch machined alloy wheels. Options were the same as the standard XLT trim level, except that a power moonroof was not available until 2005.

Limited (2003–2007): As the top-of-the-line trim level of the Escape from 2003 to 2007, the Limited trim level added the following equipment to the XLT Sport trim level: an AM/FM stereo with six-disc in-dash CD/MP3 changer, the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer, low-back front bucket seats, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual power heated front bucket seats, a security system, color-keyed exterior trim, luxury interior trim, and a unique front grille. Options were limited, but included a power moonroof.

Hybrid (2005–2007): Based on the mid-range XLT trim level, the Hybrid included: the 2.3-liter &quot;Duratec&quot; inline-four engine with a continuously variable transmission and electric motor, power front bucket seats, low-back front bucket seats, enhanced cloth seating surfaces, unique 16-inch alloy wheels, and four-wheel disc brakes (front vented, rear solid). Options included a power moonroof, a unique integrated GPS navigational system with hybrid information system, Sirius Satellite Radio, the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, and a &quot;two-tone&quot; exterior paint scheme, with silver-painted lower exterior trim and front and rear bumpers.

==== 2004–2006 (ZB) ====
The Escape and Tribute were updated in February 2004 for the 2005 model year with a new base engine (the 2.3 L Duratec 23), which replaced the Zetec 2.0 L four-cylinder. The most powerful engine remained the Duratec 3.0 L V6, with new engine mounts. Ford also added advanced airbag and seatbelt safety systems, an intelligent AWD system, and exterior minor changes, which included a redesigned front bumper. The 2005 model year was the first with an automatic transmission available on the base four-cylinder models. Models equipped with the V6 engine and four-wheel drive now featured four-wheel disc brakes (front vented, rear solid). The automatic shifter was moved from the column to the console on all models equipped with automatic transmissions. Ford also deleted the rear-seat recline feature to improve the safety of rear-seat occupants in the event of a rear crash.

==== 2006–2008 (ZC; Asia-Pacific) ====

Previewed by the Ford Equator Concept in 2005, a revamped ZC Escape designed in Taiwan by Ford Lio Ho went on sale in the second half of 2006 for the Asian and Pacific markets (except South Korea, where the North American-market Escape is sold). Major external changes included a redesigned front bumper, grille, headlights and hood, and rear bumper, as well as LED taillights.

On the inside, changes included a floor-mounted automatic-transmission shifter, in place of the column shifter, as well as a redesigned center stack containing audio and climate controls. Climate control is automatic on all models except the XLS. The Limited model also featured full color-coded bumpers, wheel arches and side moldings, as well as side mirrors with integrated LED indicators. Rear drum brakes have been replaced by disc brakes all round.

The 3.0 L V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%, while the 2.3 L 4-cylinder has improved midrange torque and an electronic throttle, as well as a slight increase in power to . Both engines had been certified to meet Euro III emission regulations. A four-speed automatic carried over and was the sole transmission choice. Two different four-speed automatic transmissions were used, CD4E for 3.0 L V6 and GF4AX-EL for 2.3 L 4-cylinder.

==== 2008–2009 (ZD; Asia-Pacific) ====
Previewed by the Ford Escape Adventure Concept, the ZD Escape designed in Taiwan by Ford Lio Ho for Asia-Pacific markets went on sale in mid-2008, bringing numerous changes. In Australia, the V6 engine was dropped, leaving only the 2.3-liter four-cylinder.

The model range was also simplified, with only a single specification available. Changes to the body included an all-new front bumper, grille, headlights and bonnet, featuring an enlarged Ford emblem set upon a three-bar chrome grille. At the rear, new, slimmer tail lights were featured, which were arranged horizontally, rather than vertically. In addition, the B-pillar was now painted black, rather than body-colour. Compared with the previous model, all external bumpers, mirrors, and cladding were painted the same colour as the body (previously, this was only available on the upscale Limited model). Equipment levels have also improved. Compared to the base model ZC Escape, the ZD included standard side airbags, automatic climate control, 16&quot; alloy wheels, and mirrors with integrated indicators. Unlike most other competitors in its class, curtain airbags and electronic stability control were not available.

==== 2009–2012 (ZD; Asia-Pacific) ====
In 2009, a facelift of the ZD Escape developed by Ford Lio Ho brought about a new grille and front bumper. Chrome trim was completely removed from the grille, replaced with a smaller, black honeycomb grille as the last Ford Escape. In its final years, it was sold alongside its successor, Ford Kuga until the Kuga replaced it in 2013.

=== Mercury Mariner ===

Introduced in 2004 for the 2005-model-year refresh of the Ford Escape in the US, Ford&#x27;s Mercury division released a version called the Mercury Mariner. The Mariner is Mercury&#x27;s first car-based SUV, and was slotted below the Mercury Mountaineer in its lineup. The Mariner was officially offered in the US, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. The Mariner includes stylistic differences, such as a two-tone interior, turn signal repeaters borrowed from the European-market Ford Maverick (the Escape&#x27;s name in Europe), monotone cladding, and the Mercury &quot;waterfall&quot; front grille. Unlike its counterparts, Mercury did not offer a manual transmission as part of the powertrain lineup. The Mariner was the first Mercury with a four-cylinder since the Mercury Cougar was dropped in 2002. For 2006, the lineup was expanded with the introduction of the Mariner Hybrid. Sales ended after the 2007 model year, replaced by a second generation, again a rebadged Ford Escape.

On September 7, 2006, Ford delivered a special &quot;Presidential Edition&quot; Mercury Mariner Hybrid to former President Bill Clinton. Its custom features include: LED lighting, 120V outlet, rear bucket seats, center console &amp; rear seat fold-out writing desks, personal DVD players for each seat, refrigerator, increased rear seat legroom. There have also been several undisclosed security modifications made to the vehicle.

The Mariner Hybrid powertrain was identical to its sibling, the Ford Escape Hybrid. It was launched to the U.S. market in 2006 and was discontinued in 2010 (in the second generation) when the Mercury car division itself was discontinued by Ford. The Mariner hybrid sold a total of 12,300 units.

Like the Ford Escape Hybrid, the Mariner Hybrid is a &quot;full&quot; hybrid electric system, meaning the system can switch automatically between pure electric power, pure gasoline engine power, or a combination of both, for maximum performance and efficiency at all speeds and loads. When braking or decelerating, the Mariner&#x27;s hybrid system uses regenerative braking, where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle&#x27;s momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. With , the Mariner Hybrid has nearly the same acceleration performance as the conventional V6 Mariner. Again, just like the Escape Hybrid, it gets a respectable average of and is sometimes said to be the most fuel efficient sport utility vehicle on the road.

=== Hybrid ===
The Ford Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid are the gasoline–electric hybrid powered versions that launched in the U.S. in 2004 for the 2005 model year. Assembled in Kansas City, Missouri, it was the first hybrid SUV produced for sale and the first hybrid from an American manufacturer (alongside the Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra Hybrids during the same model year). According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the first-generation Ford Escape Hybrid is 70% more efficient than the regular Escape. While the Mercury Mariner was also offered as a hybrid, the option was not available on the Mazda Tribute.

Escape hybrid versions can be identified by the &quot;Hybrid&quot; badges located on the front doors as well as near the right tailgate. In addition, the driver&#x27;s side window in the cargo area is smaller to accommodate a ventilation slot for the high-voltage battery. There was also a &quot;Special Appearance Package&quot; available as an option on the 2005–2007 Hybrid models. This package replaced the traditional lower cladding of the Escape with a silver finish. Standard equipment on the Escape Hybrid includes: an eight-way power adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, cruise control, a six-CD stereo, 16-inch alloy wheels, power door locks with remote keyless entry, power windows, four-wheel disc brakes, and electric power steering.

Ford built 17,000 Escape Hybrids in the second half of 2004, four times as many as it had originally planned. Starting in 2005, New York City and other cities in the world began using the Ford Escape Hybrid as taxicabs. The Ford Escape Hybrid won the &quot;North American Truck of the Year&quot; award in 2005.

==== Drivetrain technology ====
The Escape Hybrid uses hybrid technology similar to that used in the Toyota Prius. Ford engineers realized their technology may conflict with patents held by Toyota, which led to a 2004 patent-sharing accord between the companies, licensing Ford&#x27;s use of some of Toyota&#x27;s hybrid technology in exchange for Toyota&#x27;s use of some of Ford&#x27;s diesel and direct-injection engine technology. Ford maintains that Ford received no technical assistance from Toyota in developing the hybrid powertrain, but that some hybrid engine technologies developed by Ford independently were found to be similar to technologies previously patented by Toyota, so licenses were obtained. Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd., a Japanese automotive components supplier belonging to the Toyota Group, supplies the HD-10 hybrid continuously variable transmission for the Escape Hybrid. While Toyota produces its third-generation Prius transmission in-house, Aisin is the only supplier of hybrid transmissions to other manufacturers. Friction has arisen concerning Aisin&#x27;s allocation of limited production capacity and engineering resources to Ford. Sanyo Electric Co. built the , 330 volt 5.5 Ah (would make it 1.8kWh storage), 250-cell nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery pack for the 2005 Escape Hybrid.

The Escape Hybrid is a full hybrid, meaning the system can switch automatically between pure electric power, pure gasoline engine power, or a combination of electric battery and gasoline engine operating together, for maximum performance and efficiency at all speeds and loads. When braking or decelerating, the Escape&#x27;s hybrid system uses regenerative braking, where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle&#x27;s momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. The Escape Hybrid&#x27;s 133 horsepower (99 kW) Atkinson cycle gasoline I4 engine and electric motor combine to give , which gives the Hybrid Escape nearly the same acceleration performance as the conventional V6 Escape due to the electric motor&#x27;s torque being available from zero rpm.

The hybrid is said to give approximately 75% greater efficiency, the FWD version has EPA ratings of 30 mpg and 28 highway, with combined 29 mpg. The AWD version EPA ratings 28 city and 26 highway, combined 27 mpg -U.S. in city traffic, and has demonstrated it can travel 400–500 miles (644–805 km) on a single mpg-U.S. (7.6L-8.1 L/100 km; 35–37 mpg-imp) on the highway. To obtain these mileage figures, the owners manual states that pure gasoline, not ethanol blends, must be used. In 2006, Ford showed an Escape that could run on E85 fuel.

Unlike conventional vehicles, hybrids often achieve better figures in the city because they do not waste power idling and can recover some power when stopping (by using regenerative braking) that would be wasted in a conventional vehicle.

=== Recalls ===

==== Subframe failure ====
In April 2014, Ford issued a recall on 386,000 Ford Escapes and Mazda Tributes for model years 2001–2004 for Escapes manufactured October 22, 1999, through January 23, 2004, for Canada and the northern &quot;salt belt&quot; states in the US. Subframe rust can result in the lower control arm mount breaking or detaching from the subframe, resulting in a loss of steering control and the risk of crash. Dealers have installed a crossbrace reinforcement to any vehicle affected by the recall. Model years 2005–2007 were not affected.

== Second generation (2008) ==

The second-generation Ford Escape debuted at the 2006 Los Angeles International Auto Show. The North American market Escape and its Mazda Tribute and Mercury Mariner siblings were redesigned to stay competitive with other new compact SUVs; however, most of the internals have been carried over for the 2008 model year. The Escape still uses the CD2 platform. Ford also included an electronic stability control system on the 2008 Escape. The Mercury version lasted until late 2010, withdrawn from the market as part of the closure of the Mercury brand, with Mazda&#x27;s Tribute ending production in late 2011. Ford ended manufacture of the second-generation Escape in 2012.

The updated Escape received some styling cues from the Explorer, Edge, and Expedition. Changes included a new grille with larger headlamps in the front fascia, while the sides were revised with cleaner lines and rounder wheel arches. The interior was also completely redesigned, including the newest standard Ford family navigation system.

The 2008 Escape and its Mercury Mariner sibling were the first vehicles to feature Ford&#x27;s pull-drift steering mode, an enhancement made possible by applying software control to the Electric Power Steering (EPS) system. This system came standard on all second-generation CD2 models. All second-generation CD2 models came with front disc/rear drum brakes, except for 2008 Hybrid models which carried over the four-wheel disc brake setup from the previous generation.

The 2008 models of all three CD-2 versions retained the previous generation&#x27;s engines and transmissions. However, the manual transmission was only available with the four-cylinder and front-wheel drive. For 2009, all three versions received engine and transmission upgrades that increased performance and fuel economy.

Ford ended production on the second-generation Escape in 2012 and moved production to its Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where it was succeeded by a new Escape based on its European CUV counterpart, the Ford Kuga.

=== Ford ===
A new concept version for the Asian market, called the &quot;Ford Escape Adventure Concept&quot;, was revealed at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. It features a revised front and rear fascia, incorporating Ford&#x27;s three-bar grille styling theme and restyled LED tail lamps.

For the 2009 model year, the 2.3 L Duratec 23 was replaced by a new 2.5 L Duratec 25 4-cylinder, which boosted standard power to and of torque, while increasing fuel economy by 1 mpg (~2L/100 km) on both urban and extra-urban cycles. This engine was the base engine on all trims. The 3.0 L Duratec 30 V6, optional on XLT and now Limited, was thoroughly updated, resulting in a increase, bringing power output to and of torque. The Duratec 30 also saw a fuel economy improvement. Another significant change was the switch to Ford&#x27;s new 6F35 6-speed automatic, which became standard on all models except the XLS FWD, where it was optional.

The Hybrid is also upgraded to use the 2.5 L (albeit still using the Atkinson cycle for better fuel economy). Efficiency improved to city and highway according to the US EPA. The 2.5 L engine brings the Hybrid&#x27;s power output up by to combined when the electric motor is added in. In addition, the 2009 hybrid model changed the air conditioning compressor from an engine-driven belt to being electrically powered by the HV traction battery. This allowed the air-conditioning system to continue cooling while the gas engine was off; for example, while at stop lights.

Other mechanical changes include a new rear stabilizer bar, revised suspension tuning, upgrades to the 3.0 L V6 that brought power to 240 hp, and a new exhaust system on all Escapes. The braking system for the Hybrid versions has been revised with a vacuum assist unit that reviewers have said give the brakes a consistent feel over the entire travel of the brake pedal. Previous versions of the Hybrid were reported to have a slightly mushy brake feel, primarily due to the fact that for the first part of the brake travel and braking the system is regenerating power instead of engaging the brake pads against the rotors. However, the brakes, when tested, gave the Escape extremely long stops.

For 2009, Ford&#x27;s SYNC system was standard on the Hybrid, Hybrid Limited, and conventional Limited models, and optional on the XLS and XLT.

The Escape underwent some minor aerodynamic changes for 2009, including a revised front chin spoiler and rear tire spoilers. Along with the addition of rear tire spoilers is an optional 17&quot; chrome-clad wheel equipped with a new Michelin &quot;Low-Rolling-Resistance-Tire&quot;, slightly increasing ground clearance and improving traction over the standard 16&quot; wheels and tires. Another new feature is Ford&#x27;s Easy-Fuel capless fuel filling system. 2009 also saw the introduction of the optional &quot;sport appearance package&quot;, which changed the front grille from chrome to gloss black, added a gloss black appliqué to the front bumper, changed the rocker covers and door handles from unpainted black plastic to body-coloured, added a gloss black rear spoiler, black headlamp housings, black 17&quot; rims, and black cloth/leather interior with piano black trim. This option was only available on the XLT trim level and only with ingot silver, sterling gray, steel blue, or tuxedo black metallic paints. The &quot;Escape&quot; badge was entirely removed from the front doors, and V6 badges were also removed from the front fenders on V6 models.

As of August 2009, the Escape was among the four Ford vehicles, along with the Focus, F-Series and Ranger, to benefit the most from the Cash for Clunkers program, where it showed a 49 percent increase in sales.

In mid-2009, for the 2010 model year, the Escape added a standard integrated spotter mirror for better blind-spot viewing. Everything else added in the 2008 and 2009 model years was carried over, but the optional orders have been renamed to Rapid Specification Codes (100S for XLS, 200S for XLT, and 300S for Limited). Other new features and changes for 2010 included Active Park Assist (optional on Limited models). Active Park Assist uses sensors on the front and rear of the vehicle to detect an available parallel-parking space and automatically steers the vehicle into the space while the driver controls the accelerator and brakes. A liftgate-mounted backup camera also became optional on Limited. The camera sends images to a video display in the rearview mirror or the navigation system screen to help enhance visibility directly behind the vehicle when it is in reverse. The liftgate release handle was relocated to the bottom of the liftgate. V6 models now came standard with flex-fuel capability, and 4WD models no longer had the 4WD badge on the liftgate.

No cosmetic changes were made for the 2011 model year, except that later models featured a redesigned liftgate glass handle. The only minor change is the standardization of SYNC Traffic &amp; Directions on models equipped with Ford Sync.

There are no cosmetic or equipment changes for the 2012 model year. The third-generation Escape was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

Previously unavailable Electronic Stability Control system became standard on the second generation. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests the Escape along with its cousins, the Mercury Mariner and the Mazda Tribute, are rated &quot;Good&quot; in both frontal and side impact crash tests. They are rated &quot;Good&quot; for rear crash protection as well and were given the &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award until 2010. In roof strength tests the Escape receives a &quot;Marginal&quot; rating while hybrid models are rated &quot;Poor&quot;.

=== Mazda ===
In 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Tribute was significantly revamped, like its Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner siblings. Originally set to be renamed the Mazda CX-5, the vehicle kept the Tribute name. The changes were significant, but fell short of a &quot;clean sheet&quot; redesign, as the vehicles remained on the CD2 platform, and kept the old 2.3 L MZR I4, and 3.0 L AJ V6 engines. Visible changes include all new sheet metal and interior. The interior was significantly upgraded using all new components and higher quality materials, and was generally praised by automotive journalists. However, unlike the first generation of the Tribute, which had unique exterior and interior from its siblings, the new model only differs from its siblings in the &quot;nose&quot; (front fenders, hood, and front fascia), tail lights and detailing. Notable changes to the exterior include higher belt line, and more pronounced wheel arches. Overall the car was to look larger and more substantial than the previous model. As a cost-saving measure, the rear brake was reverted to drum brake, with predictable criticisms.

The 2008 Mazda Tribute (non-hybrid) was first unveiled at the 2007 Montreal International Auto Show, and the 2008 Mazda Tribute went on sale in March 2007. A new addition was the Hybrid model, which was previously only available on the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner.

The Tribute received additional major changes to improve performance for the 2009 model year, mostly by way of mechanical upgrades. Most significantly, all new engines replaced the increasingly outmatched 2.3L I4 and 3.0L V6. Mazda&#x27;s new MZR 2.5L I4 replaced the 2.3L, boosting horsepower to and of torque at 4000 rpm. Despite increased horsepower, fuel economy also increased by on both urban and extra-urban cycles. The optional 3.0 L (AJ) V6 was thoroughly updated, resulting in a increase, bringing power output to and of torque. It also sees a 1 mpg improvement. The Tribute Hybrid was dropped after the 2009 model year.

Another significant change was the switch to Ford&#x27;s new 6F 6-speed automatic, which became standard on all V6 equipped models and optional on the I4. As well, new front and rear stabilizer bars were added for 2009 to improve ride handling after complaints about diminished performance following the 2008 changes. Others changes included redesigned seats, daytime running lamps, optional steering-wheel mounted audio controls, and other additional features. The Tribute was discontinued in November 2011 at the end of the 2011 model year, replaced by the Mazda CX-5 for 2012 that is different from the Escape.

=== Mercury ===
For the 2008 model year, the Mariner was significantly updated with a new look, although it remained on the Ford CD2 platform used by the previous generation. The first 2008 Mercury Mariner was unveiled at the South Florida International Auto Show on October 6, 2006. The changes included a new seats, headlights, taillights, a new liftgate, a higher beltline and new doors and wheels. The interior was also significantly updated with higher quality materials and more refined features. The engines remained the same but the 3.0 L Duratec V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by 10%.

The 2009 Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner were unveiled at the 2008 Washington Auto Show. Sporting a 2.5-liter engine and 6-speed automatic transmission that replaced the four-speed automatic transmission, the new powertrain improved the EPA fuel economy by 1 mile per gallon and increased power by 11% to . Also, the existing 3.0-liter Duratec V6 was bumped from to . The new engine was also the new basis for Ford&#x27;s hybrid models, including the Ford Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid. &quot;For every eight Escape and Mariner vehicles we sell, one of them is a hybrid, and the appeal is growing,&quot; says Sue Cischke, Ford senior vice president, Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering.

For the 2010 model year, the Mariner added Ford&#x27;s MyKey and trailer sway controls as standard on all trim levels. Models equipped with the V6 engine were now flex-fuel capable. Ford has also done away with the Euro-style turn signal repeaters for this model year. For the 2011 model year, the Mariner featured HD Radio as a standard, but continued with the same features as the 2010 models. This version of the Mariner was its last, as Ford discontinued the Mercury brand because of declining sales. The last Mercury Mariner rolled of the assembly line on October 5, 2010.

=== Hybrid ===
The second generation Ford Escape Hybrid received some minor styling tweaks inside and out. The major cosmetic changes included new bumpers, grille, headlights and taillights to match Ford&#x27;s new edge style. But the drivetrain was essentially the same mechanically but has had extensive software modifications. For 2009, a larger, more powerful engine was introduced, together with a revised suspension, addition of stability control, the debut of &quot;Sync&quot; voice-control system and a capless fuel filler system. The batteries and other hybrid components in a 2009 Escape hybrid added about 136 kg (300 lbs) to the vehicle. However, the added weight was blamed for an adverse effect in handling. Furthermore, from 2009 onward, rear disc brakes of previous years were swapped for drum brakes, which was criticized as a &quot;strange step backward&quot;.

The second generation Escape Hybrid was offered in two levels of specification, an undesignated &quot;base&quot; model and the more expensive &quot;Limited&quot; trim. The &quot;base&quot; included: a 60/40 split-fold rear bench seat, &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot; with roll stability control, and a single-disc four-speaker CD/MP3 stereo with Sirius Satellite Radio compatibility. The &quot;Limited&quot; adds: a chrome front grille, heated front seats, a six-way power driver&#x27;s seat and full leather upholstery, rear park assist, ambient lighting, and 16-inch six-spoke alloy wheels. For the 2009 model year, Ford SYNC became standard on both Hybrid trims and the Ford Escape Hybrid replaced the &quot;ESCAPE&quot; badges on doors with &quot;&quot;HYBRID&quot;,&quot; while relocating the logo for Ford hybrid models from near the driver&#x27;s side doors next to the &quot;HYBRID&quot; text. 2010 models saw the addition of MyKey, trailer sway controls, and integrated spotter mirror for better blind spot viewing. New optional extras are active park assist and a rear-view camera.

Ford developed a prototype E85 Hybrid Escape, the first flexible fuel hybrid electric vehicle capable of running on 85% ethanol. In 2007 Ford produced 20 demonstration Escape Hybrid E85s for real-world testing in fleets around the U.S.

From 2009, the gas engine was 2.5L Atkinson-cycle four cylinder engine with 155 hp at 6,000 rpm with an electric motor that produces 94 hp at 5,000 rpm. The maximum combined output of both was 177 hp.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the fuel economy for the 2010 Escape Hybrid (FWD) at city, and highway. The following table compares fuel economy, carbon footprint, and petroleum consumption between the hybrid version and other drivetrains of the Escape family as estimated by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy. The Escape Hybrid met both California&#x27;s SULEV and PZEV standards, with tailpipe emissions better than 90% less than the average 2003 new car and zero evaporative emissions.

By early 2012 Ford discontinued the production of the Escape Hybrid due to the introduction of the third generation Escape. Two of the new 2013 model year Escapes have direct-injected and turbocharged EcoBoost units (of 1.6 and 2.0 liters) that deliver a higher fuel economy than the 2012 model. A total of 122,850 Escape Hybrids were built since 2005, along with 12,300 units of its sibling the Mercury Mariner Hybrid, discontinued in 2010.

==== Plug-in hybrid ====

Three companies have converted Ford Escape Hybrids to plug-in under a contract with the NYSERDA and delivered them in 2007: Electrovaya of Toronto Canada, Hymotion also of Toronto Canada, Hybrids Plus of Boulder Colorado, United States.

Ford developed a research Escape Plug-in Hybrid and delivered the first of a fleet of 20 to Southern California Edison (SCE) in December 2007 to begin road testing. This project was a collaboration aimed to explore the future of plug-in hybrids and evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility&#x27;s electrical grid. Some of the vehicles were evaluated &quot;in typical customer settings&quot;, according to Ford. Ford also developed the first ever flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV, which was delivered to the United States Department of Energy in June 2008. This plug-in version of the Escape Hybrid runs on gasoline or E85 and is also part of the demonstration fleet Ford developed in a partnership with Southern California Edison and the Electric Power Research Institute.

Both the E85 version and the conventional gasoline engine version use a 10 kwh lithium-ion battery, which allows for a range at or less. When the battery&#x27;s charge drops to 30%, the vehicle switches to its four-cylinder engine, assisted by the batteries, operating as a regular hybrid electric vehicle. The vehicle has a display system that shows the driver how efficient the vehicle is at any given time. If the vehicle uses its engine and is running in traditional hybrid mode, fuel economy is rated at in the city and on the highway.

This fleet of 20 Ford Escape Plug-ins was field tested with utility company fleets in California, New York, Ohio, North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Quebec, Canada, with sales scheduled to being in 2012.

In August 2009 Ford delivered the first Escape Plug-in equipped with intelligent vehicle-to-grid (V2G) communications and control system technology to American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio. This technology allows the vehicle operator to program when to recharge the vehicle, for how long and at what utility rate. The battery systems communicate directly with the electrical grid via smart meters provided by utility companies through wireless networking. During the two years since the demonstration program began, the fleet of Escape Plug-ins has logged more than , and Ford plans to equip all 21 plug-in hybrid Escapes with the vehicle-to-grid communications technology.

The Ford demonstration vehicles and Hybrids Plus conversions are similar. The conversion involves the replacement of the original NiMH battery, located on the floor of the trunk, with a larger capacity Li-ion battery, in the same location and substantially the same volume as the original battery. The Electrovaya and Hymotion conversions retain the original battery, and augment its capacity with a Li-ion battery that occupies a significant portion of the trunk. In all cases, the conversion also involves the addition of a charger and of a power plug.

== Third generation (2013) ==
The third-generation Escape was first shown at the 2011 Los Angeles Auto Show. It was designed and rebadged by Ford of Europe alongside the largely identical European-market Ford Kuga. It was released to North American markets in 2012 for the 2013 model year. Many markets that previously used the &quot;Escape&quot; nameplate have switched to &quot;Kuga&quot; under the One Ford program, apart from the Middle East where it still bears the &quot;Escape&quot; nameplate.

The third-generation Escape is claimed to be 10 percent more aerodynamic than the previous generation. Also new for the 2013 model year is the MyFord Touch entertainment system, which offers an all-new user interface and additional features. Another new feature is the optional hands-free liftgate. A person carrying the keyless entry transmitter can raise a foot under the rear bumper of the Escape to open the tailgate. Ecofriendly seat fabrics are standard on lower trim levels, and the vehicle&#x27;s carpeting is mostly constructed from recycled plastic water bottles. This allows the new Escape to be mostly recyclable at the end of its lifecycle.

Production of the 2013 Ford Escape began 11 April 2012, with ceremonies in June 2012. The production of the previous generation 2012 Escape ended on 28 April 2012, overlapping slightly in production with the 2013 model due to plant issues, with the 2012 Ford Escape vehicles being limited in availability at Ford showrooms. In May 2012, the third-generation Escape became available at most dealerships across the United States, and was introduced in Canada starting June.

=== Powertrain ===
The base engine is the 2.5 L Duratec naturally aspirated inline-four engine which made and of torque. This engine was less powerful and efficient than newer &quot;EcoBoost&quot; engines, but it had lower cost, and was exclusive to the S trim level. On higher trims, two &quot;EcoBoost&quot; inline four-cylinder turbocharged engines were offered in North America, which were the 2.0 L which made and of torque, and the debuting 1.6 L which made and of torque. Ford claimed that the fuel economy of the new 1.6 L EcoBoost engine would match that of the previous Ford Escape Hybrid, while the new 2.0 L engine produced more torque than the previous 3.0 L V6 unit. The 1.6 L was rated for compared to the old hybrid&#x27;s combined by the EPA, though the Ecoboost compared more favorably on the highway with ratings of outperforming the hybrid&#x27;s .

The transmission is either a six-speed conventional automatic or dual-clutch automatic. The previous generation&#x27;s hybrid model with its 2.5 L Atkinson powertrain was indirectly replaced by the C-Max Hybrid, and the 3.0 L V6 engine was dropped.

=== Trim levels ===
The third-generation Escape was offered with front-wheel drive in the S trim level, and front- or all-wheel drive in the SE, SEL, and Titanium trim levels. The SEL trim was discontinued after the 2013 model year, but was reintroduced for 2018.

For the 2015 model, in the United States and Canada, Ford updated the standard naturally aspirated 2.5 L four-cylinder engine&#x27;s specification to and of torque.

=== 2017 refresh ===
On 18 November 2015, Ford unveiled a refreshed mid-cycle update of the Escape, which went on sale in the beginning of 2016 for the 2017 model year. The refresh added an Edge-inspired front fascia, while tweaking the rear end that now sports reshaped LED taillights and a newly adopted two-slat, hexagonal grille. The interior was also adjusted slightly in the cabin area and on the steering wheel.

The Sync 3 infotainment system was added as a new feature, along with a new smartphone app called Sync Connect, which allows owners to remotely monitor their vehicle, check fuel levels, lock and unlock doors, and start the engine. The 2.5 Duratec and 2.0 EcoBoost engine line-up was joined by a new 1.5 L turbocharged four-cylinder option, replacing the 1.6 L.

Ford engineers promised additional refinement to the 2017 Escape, particularly as evidenced by extremely low road- and wind-noise levels. The doors and B pillars are insulated, the front wheel wells are lined, and acoustic glass is used for the side windows. Also, new seals are used for the windshield and hood. The new Escape showcased a number of new-to-it features, from faster-charging USB ports to an application that lets drivers unlock the vehicle and start the engine through a smartphone.

Dubbed Sync Connect, this feature helps to locate the vehicle in a crowded parking lot, check the fuel level, and alert the owner when service is due. A number of driver-assist features were available: Enhanced park assist, lane-keeping, forward collision warning, and adaptive cruise control. Production of the facelifted 2017 Ford Escape started on 18 March 2016, at the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky.

=== Safety ===

=== Recall ===
In March 2017, Ford recalled 692,700 2014 Escapes because of faulty door latches.

=== Fire hazard ===
In December 2012, Ford recalled over 70,000 Escapes in the United States and Canada with 1.6 L engines that may overheat and cause fires, after 12 reports of fires in Escapes were reported to Ford.

In November 2013, Ford recalled over 160,000 Escapes with 1.6 L EcoBoost engines because of oil and fuel leaks that could lead to engine fires, after 13 fires caused by leaks were reported to Ford; the recall also covered about 12,000 to correct fuel lines installed incorrectly that could become chafed and leak gasoline.

In March 2017, Ford recalled 2014 Escapes with 1.6 L EcoBoost engines because of a risk of engine fires caused by a &quot;lack of coolant circulation&quot;. The recall partly contributed to a charge of US$300 million by Ford.

== Fourth generation (2020) ==
The fourth-generation Escape debuted on April 2, 2019, and went on sale in the third quarter of 2019 as a 2020 model. It is manufactured at the Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky. It is related to the third-generation Ford Kuga, outside North America.

Compared to its predecessor, the model is claimed to be lighter by over while occupying a footprint that is larger due to a wider track and longer length. With its larger size, the Escape provides more interior space for occupants by increasing headroom, shoulder space, and hip room for both rows of seats. Combustion-powered models are equipped with sliding second-row seats that allows a maximum of of cargo space.

In China and Taiwan, the fourth generation Escape has a slightly restyled front fascia compared to the North American version, and would be sold alongside the previous generation, which was sold as the Ford Kuga.

=== Powertrain ===
There are four new engine-transmission combinations including a plug-in gas-electric hybrid that can go on electricity alone with an efficiency rating of 100 MPGe, as well as a conventional hybrid and two turbocharged engines mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.

The base engine, a turbocharged 1.5-liter inline three-cylinder, makes and of torque. It is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission with front-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive. An available turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes and of torque but only comes with all-wheel drive.

The Escape Hybrid, returning after an extended absence, and all-new plug-in hybrid are powered by a 2.5-liter gasoline inline-four that runs on the more efficient Atkinson cycle, along with two electric motors and a planetary gearset that combines the two power sources and allows for gear-ratio changes, essentially operating as a continuously variable transmission setup known as an eCVT. The standard hybrid&#x27;s battery pack is rated at 1.1 kilowatt-hours, while the plug-in hybrid&#x27;s is significantly larger, at 14.4 kWh with a 10.7 kWh usable capacity; both are lithium-ion packs that fit underneath the cabin floor. Combined horsepower for the standard hybrid is , while the plug-in has combined.

In China, the Escape plug-in hybrid comes with &quot;CAF384WQ2P&quot; 1.5-liter three-cylinder turbocharged gasoline engine that produces at 6000rpm and of torque from 1750-4500rpm, paired with a &quot;TZ236XYHF45&quot; permanent magnet synchronous motor outputting and ; combined output is through an eCVT transmission. The battery is a 15.1kWh liquid-cooled 400V NMC pack which allows for an NEDC range of .

=== Markets ===

==== United States ====
In the United States, the Escape was available in five trim levels from 2020 to 2022: S, SE, SE Sport(2020 only, becoming an appearance package on SE trim from 2021 to 2022), SEL, and Titanium. All trims except for the S trim (only available with a gasoline engine) and the SE Sport (only available as a gasoline hybrid model) are available with gasoline-only, gasoline hybrid, and gasoline plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powertrains. All models offer a choice of either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, except for PHEV models which are only available with front-wheel drive.

The PHEV model became available in U.S. dealers in October 2021 for the 2021 model year.

==== Mexico ====
On October 17, 2019, this generation went on sale in Mexico with the 2.0-liter Ecoboost and 2.5-liter hybrid powertrains. For 2022, the Ecoboost engine was dropped and was indirectly replaced by the newly introduced Ford Territory, making the Escape a hybrid only model in the country.

==== Australia ====
The fourth-generation Escape became available in Australia in the third quarter of 2020, designated as the ZH series. While marketed as the Escape, the Australian model adopts the exterior styling from the European Kuga as the vehicles are sourced from Spain. Powertrain options include a 2.0-litre &quot;EcoBoost&quot; gasoline engine and a 2.5-litre plug-in hybrid. Trim levels offered are standard, ST-Line, and Vignale. Ford discontinued the Escape in Australia in 2023 due to poor sales, and is being indirectly replaced by the electric Mustang Mach-E.

==== Middle East ====
The fourth-generation Escape was launched in the GCC markets in 2021. It is powered by the 1.5-litre turbo petrol engine and it is offered in two grades, Ambiente and Trend. The Escape was discontinued in 2022 and was indirectly replaced by the Ford Territory.

==== China and Taiwan ====
In China, the fourth-generation Escape was sold alongside its predecessor, which was sold as the Kuga in China. The Chinese market version features a restyled front fascia with a larger grille, and the blue oval logo being positioned in the center of the grille. However, the ST-line trim has the same design as European model. The Escape also comes with a localized entertainment system called Sync+ with a larger display. The same styling variant was also sold as the Ford Kuga in the Taiwanese market with the 1.5-liter engine models, while 2.0-liter engine models were sold with European style front grille.

=== 2023 refresh ===
Ford announced a refreshed Escape lineup for the North American market in October 2022 for the 2023 model year. The exterior featured minor changes including an updated grille and headlights, restyled taillights that lack amber turn signal bulbs in the US and an optional front light bar. While the power output remains the same, both EcoBoost engines were heavily reworked to meet emissions standards. The hybrid and plug-in hybrid were only slightly modified, and power ratings drop slightly due to following new SAE J2908 measurement methods.

The interior features updates to the console and infotainment system. All models now come with a digital gauge cluster, with an 8-inch screen flanked by digital temperature and fuel level gauges coming standard, and the optional 12.3 inch LCD dashboard is retained with updated graphics. The 8-inch LCD infotainment system is retained for lower models, while higher models receive a new 13.2 inch infotainment system with SYNC 4. Models with the 8-inch infotainment screen retain physical knobs and buttons for the climate controls, while the new larger screen setup only has up to 6 shortcut buttons and a volume knob; all climate and vehicle settings are controlled via the touchscreen.

The previous trim lineup was entirely replaced, with the S, SE, and Titanium trims supplanted by Base, Active, and Platinum, respectively; the SEL trim was also discontinued and indirectly replaced with three &quot;ST-Line&quot; trim levels. Meanwhile, the plug-in hybrid version, previously offered in combination with other trims, became a standalone trim.

=== Safety ===
The 2020 Escape was awarded the &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

<text>Call off the Search is the debut studio album by British jazz and blues singer Katie Melua, released in 2003.

==Recording and release==
British songwriter, producer and arranger Mike Batt signed Melua to his Dramatico recording and management label after she performed at a showcase at the Brit School for the Performing Arts in early 2003. Batt was looking for a young artist capable of &quot;performing jazz and blues in an interesting way&quot;. Melua went into the studio soon after with Batt as the producer. She recorded songs written by Batt, John Mayall, Delores J. Silver, herself, Randy Newman, and James Shelton. Melua wrote &quot;Faraway Voice&quot; about singer Eva Cassidy. &quot;Belfast (Penguins and Cats)&quot; refers to Melua&#x27;s upbringing in Belfast, Northern Ireland: &quot;Penguins&quot; referring to Protestants and &quot;Cats&quot; to Catholics.

&quot;Call off the Search&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2003. It became a hit, reaching number one on the UK album chart in January 2004 and the top twenty of the Australian album chart in June 2004. It spent 87 weeks in the ARIA Top 100, certified Platinum for shipments of 70,000+. First single &quot;The Closest Thing to Crazy&quot;, written by Batt, reached the top five in Ireland, top ten in the UK, top twenty in Norway, and top fifty in Australia. The second single from the album was the title track, &quot;Call Off the Search&quot;, which gave Melua her second UK top twenty hit. The third single, a cover of Mayall&#x27;s &quot;Crawling up a Hill&quot;, was released on 18 July as the third single in the UK. In the UK the album sold 1.8 million copies within its first five months of release, making it six times platinum. It spent six weeks at the top of the UK chart.

==Chart performance==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Call off the Search&quot; was the 5th best selling album of 2004 with 1,356,962 copies sold, and has sold over 1.9 million copies in the UK as of January 2013.

<text>Shawiya, or Shawiya Berber, also spelt Chaouïa (native form: &quot;Tacawit&quot; ), is a Zenati Berber language spoken in Algeria by the Shawiya people. The language&#x27;s primary speech area is the Awras Mountains in Eastern Algeria and the surrounding areas, including parts of Western Tunisia, including Batna, Khenchela, Sétif, Oum El Bouaghi, Souk Ahras, Tébessa and the northern part of Biskra. 
It is closely related to the Shenwa language of Central Algeria.

==Language==
The Shawiya people call their language &quot;Tacawit&quot; (&quot;Thashawith&quot;) ( or ). Estimates of number of speakers range from 1.4 to 3 million speakers.

The French spelling of &quot;Chaouïa&quot; is commonly seen, due to the influence of French conventions on Algeria. Other spellings are &quot;Chaoui&quot;, &quot;Shawia&quot;, &quot;Tachawit&quot;, &quot;Thachawith&quot;, &quot;Tachaouith&quot; and &quot;Thchèwith&quot;. In Shawiya, the leading – pronounced in that phonetic environment – is often reduced to an , so the native name is often heard as &quot;Hašawiθ&quot;.

Shawiya Berber was, until recently, an unwritten language and rarely taught at school. As the Shawiya people were predominantly rural and secluded, they often code-switch to Algerian Arabic, French or even English to discuss non-traditional technology and sociological concerns.

Recently, the Shawiya language, together with the Kabyle language, has begun to achieve some cultural and media prominence thanks to the Berber cultural and political movements in Algeria and to the introduction of Berber language education in some public schools.

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===
* can also be laxed as .

=== Consonants ===
* All consonants are geminated in tense positions. The tense equivalents of the spirants are the plosives . Simple do not occur phonemically, and simple is apparently uncommon. 
*Sounds are only heard when /n/ precedes semivowels /j, w/.
*Sounds are only heard when in tense positions.

<text>Sened is an extinct East Zenati Berber language that was spoken in the nearby towns of Sened and Majoura (Berber &quot;Tmagurt&quot;) in southern Tunisia until the mid-20th century. In 1911, the whole town of Sened spoke Berber; by 1968, only the elderly did.

<doc id="802893" wikidata="Q2267028" url="?curid=802893" title="History of Arda">
<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, the history of Arda, also called the history of Middle-earth, began when the Ainur entered Arda, following the creation events in the Ainulindalë and long ages of labour throughout Eä, the fictional universe. Time from that point was measured using Valian Years, though the subsequent history of Arda was divided into three time periods using different years, known as the Years of the Lamps, the Years of the Trees, and the Years of the Sun. A separate, overlapping chronology divides the history into &#x27;Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar&#x27;. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves during the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries of the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the Years of the Sun. Most Middle-earth stories take place in the first three Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar.

Major themes of the history are the divine creation of the world, followed by the splintering of the created light as different wills come into conflict. Scholars have noted the biblical echoes of God, Satan, and the fall of man here, rooted in Tolkien&#x27;s own Christian faith. Arda is, as critics have noted, &quot;our own green and solid Earth at some quite remote epoch in the past.&quot; As such, it has not only an immediate story but a history, and the whole thing is an &quot;imagined prehistory&quot; of the Earth as it is now.

==Music of the Ainur==

The supreme deity of Tolkien&#x27;s universe is Eru Ilúvatar. Ilúvatar created spirits named the Ainur from his thoughts, and some were considered brothers or sisters. Ilúvatar made divine music with them. Melkor, then the most powerful of the Ainur, broke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar began first a second theme, and then a third theme, which the Ainur could not comprehend since they were not the source of it. The essence of their song symbolized the history of the whole universe and the Children of Ilúvatar that were to dwell in it – Men and Elves.

Then Ilúvatar created Eä, which means &quot;to be,&quot; the universe itself, and formed within it Arda, the Earth, &quot;globed within the void&quot;: the world together with the three airs is set apart from &quot;Avakúma&quot;, the &quot;void&quot; without. The first 15 of the Ainur that descended to Arda, and the most powerful ones, were called Valar; the lesser Ainur were called Maiar.

== Years of Arda ==

=== Valian Years ===

==== Years of the Lamps ====

When the Valar entered Arda, it was still lifeless and had no distinct geographical features. The initial shape of Arda, chosen by the Valar, was much more symmetrical, including the central continent of Middle-earth. Middle-earth was also originally much larger, and was lit by the misty light that veiled the barren ground. The Valar concentrated this light in two large lamps, called Illuin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë forged two great pillar-like mountains, Helcar in the north and Ringil in the south. Illuin was set upon Helcar and Ormal upon Ringil. In the middle, where the light of the lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt at the island of Almaren upon the Great Lake.
This period, known as the Spring of Arda, was a time when the Valar had ordered the World as they wished and rested upon Almaren, and Melkor lurked beyond the Walls of Night. During this time animals first appeared, and forests started to grow.
The Spring of Arda was interrupted when Melkor returned to Arda, creating his fortress of Utumno (Udûn) beneath the Iron Mountains in the far north. The period ended when Melkor assaulted and destroyed the Lamps of the Valar. Arda was again darkened, and the fall of the great Lamps spoiled the symmetry of Arda&#x27;s surface. New continents were created: Aman in the West, Middle-earth proper in the middle, the uninhabited lands (later called the Land of the Sun) in the East. At the site of the northern lamp was later the inland Sea of Helcar, of which Cuiviénen was a bay. At the site of the southern lamp was later the Sea of Ringil. After the destruction of the Two Lamps the Years of the Lamps ended and the Years of the Trees began. A Valian Year was considerably longer than a solar year.

==== Years of the Trees ====

After the destruction of the Two Lamps and the kingdom of Almaren, the Valar abandoned Middle-earth, moving to the continent of Aman. There they built their Second Kingdom, Valinor. Yavanna made the Two Trees, named &quot;Telperion&quot; (the silver tree) and &quot;Laurelin&quot; (the golden tree) in the land of Valinor. The Trees illuminated Valinor, leaving Middle-earth in darkness. The Years of the Trees were contemporary with Middle-earth&#x27;s Sleep of Yavanna (recalled by Treebeard as the Great Darkness).

The Years of the Trees were divided into two epochs. The first ten ages, the Days of Bliss, saw peace and prosperity in Valinor. The Eagles, the Ents, and the Dwarves were conceived by Manwë, Yavanna, and Aulë respectively, but placed into slumber until the awakening of the Elves. The next ten ages, called the Noontide of the Blessed Realm, saw Varda kindling the stars above Middle-earth. This was the first time after the Spring of Arda that Middle-earth was illuminated. The first Elves awoke in Cuiviénen in the middle of Middle-earth, marking the start of the First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar, and were soon approached by the Enemy Melkor who hoped to enslave them. Learning of this, the Valar and the Maiar came into Middle-earth and, in the War of the Powers (also called the Battle of the Powers), defeated Melkor and brought him captive to Valinor. This began the period of the Peace of Arda.

After the War of the Powers, Oromë of the Valar summoned the Elves to Aman. Many of the Elves went with Oromë on the Great Journey westwards towards Aman. Along the journey several groups of Elves tarried, notably the Nandor and the Sindar. The three clans that arrived at Aman were the Vanyar, the Noldor, and the Teleri. They made their home in Eldamar. After Melkor appeared to repent and was released after his servitude of three Ages, he stirred up rivalry between the Noldorin King Finwë&#x27;s two sons Fëanor and Fingolfin. With the help of the giant spider Ungoliant, he killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils, three gems crafted by Fëanor that contained light of the Two Trees, from his vault, and destroyed the Trees of the Valar. The world was again dark, save for the faint starlight.

Bitter at the Valar&#x27;s inactivity, Fëanor and his house left to pursue Melkor, cursing him with the name &quot;Morgoth&quot;. While his brother Finarfin chose to stay in Valinor, a larger host led by Fingolfin followed Fëanor. They reached Alqualondë, the port-city of the Teleri, who forbade them from taking their ships for the journey to Middle-earth. The first Kinslaying thus ensued, and the Noldor that partook were exiled indefinitely. Fëanor and his children in return swore an oath to retake the Silmarils, that the Valar turned to a curse over the house of Fëanor. Fëanor&#x27;s host sailed on the boats, leaving Fingolfin&#x27;s host behind – who crossed over to Middle-earth on the Helcaraxë (Grinding Ice) in the far north, losing many. The War of the Great Jewels followed, and lasted until the end of the First Age. Meanwhile, the Valar took the last living fruit of &quot;Laurelin&quot; and the last living flower of &quot;Telperion&quot; and used them to create the Moon and Sun, which remained a part of Arda, but were separate from Ambar (the world). The first rising of the sun over Ambar heralded the end of the Years of the Trees, and the start of the Years of the Sun, which last to the present day.

===Years of the Sun===

The Years of the Sun were the last of the three great time-periods of Arda. They began with the first sunrise in conjunction with the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, and last until the present day. The Years of the Sun began towards the end of the First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar and continued through the Second, Third, and part of the Fourth in Tolkien&#x27;s stories. Tolkien estimated that modern times would correspond to the sixth or seventh age.

==Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar==

The First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar (&quot;Eruhíni&quot;) began during the Years of the Trees when the Elves awoke in Cuiviénen in the middle-east of Middle-earth. This marked the start of the years when the Children of Ilúvatar were active in Middle-earth.

===First Age===


The First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar, also referred to as the Elder Days in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, began during the Years of the Trees when the Elves awoke at Cuiviénen, and hence the events mentioned above under &quot;Years of the Trees&quot; overlap with the beginning of the First Age.

Having crossed into Middle-earth, Fëanor was soon lost in an attack on Morgoth&#x27;s Balrogs – but his sons survived and founded realms, as did the followers of his half-brother Fingolfin, who reached Beleriand after Fëanor&#x27;s death. In the &quot;Dagor Aglareb&quot; (&quot;Glorious Battle&quot;), the armies of the Noldor led by Fingolfin and Maedhros attacked from the east and west, destroying the invading Orcs and laid siege to Morgoth&#x27;s stronghold Angband. The Noldor for a time maintained the Siege of Angband, resulting in the Long Peace. This Peace lasted hundreds of years, during which time Men arrived over the Blue Mountains. Fingolfin died when Morgoth broke the siege in the &quot;Dagor Bragollach&quot; (&quot;Battle of Sudden Flame&quot;). The Elves, Men, and Dwarves were all disastrously defeated in the &quot;Nírnaeth Arnoediad&quot; (&quot;Battle of Unnumbered Tears&quot;), and one by one, the kingdoms fell, even the hidden ones of Doriath and Gondolin.

At the end of the age, all that remained of free Elves and Men in Beleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the River Sirion and another on the Isle of Balar. Eärendil possessed the Silmaril which his wife Elwing&#x27;s grandparents, Beren and Lúthien, had taken from Morgoth. But Fëanor&#x27;s sons still maintained that all the Silmarils belonged to them, and so there were two more Kinslayings. Eärendil and Elwing crossed the Great Sea to beg the Valar for aid against Morgoth. They responded, sending forth a great host. In the War of Wrath, Melkor was utterly defeated. He was expelled into the Void and most of his works were destroyed, bringing the First Age to an end. This came at a terrible cost, however, as most of Beleriand itself was sunk.

===Second Age===

The Second Age is characterized by the establishment and flourishing of Númenor, the rise of Sauron in Middle-earth, the creation of the Rings of Power and the Ringwraiths, and the early wars of the Rings between Sauron and the Elves. It ended with Sauron&#x27;s defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.

At the start of the Second Age, the Men who had remained faithful were given the island of Númenor, in the middle of the Great Sea, and there they established a powerful kingdom. The White Tree of Númenor was planted in the King&#x27;s city of Armenelos; and it was said that while that tree stood in the King&#x27;s courtyard, the reign of Númenor would endure. The Elves were granted pardon for the sins of Fëanor, and were allowed to return home to the Undying Lands. The Númenóreans became great seafarers, and were learned, wise, and had a lifespan beyond other men. At first, they honored the Ban of the Valar, never sailing into the Undying Lands. They went east to Middle-earth and taught the men living there valuable skills. After a time, they became jealous of the Elves for their immortality. Sauron, Morgoth&#x27;s chief servant, was still active. As Annatar, in disguise he taught the Elves of Eregion the craft of creating Rings of Power. Seven Rings were made for the Dwarves, while Nine were made for Men who later became known as the Ringwraiths. He built a stronghold called Barad-dûr and secretly forged the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom to control the other rings and their bearers. Celebrimbor, a grandson of Fëanor, forged three mighty rings on his own: Vilya, possessed first by the Elven king Gil-galad, then by Elrond; Nenya, wielded by Galadriel; and Narya, given by Celebrimbor to Círdan, who gave it to Gandalf.

As soon as Sauron put on the One Ring, the Elves realized that they had been betrayed and removed the Three (Sauron eventually obtained the Seven and the Nine. While he was unable to suborn the Dwarf ringbearers, he had more success with the Men who bore the Nine; they became the Nazgûl, the Ringwraiths). Sauron then made war on the elves and nearly destroyed them utterly during the Dark Years, but when it seemed defeat was imminent, the Númenóreans joined the battle and completely crushed the forces of Sauron. Sauron never forgot the ruin brought on his armies by the Númenóreans, and made it his goal to destroy them.

Towards the end of the age, the Númenóreans became increasingly haughty. Now they sought to dominate other men and to establish kingdoms. Centuries after Tar-Minastir&#x27;s engagement, when Sauron had largely recovered, Ar-Pharazôn, the last and most powerful of the Kings of Númenor, humbled Sauron – his armies deserting in the face of Númenor&#x27;s might – and brought him to Númenor as a hostage, although this was Sauron&#x27;s goal. At this time still beautiful in appearance, Sauron gained Ar-Pharazôn&#x27;s trust and became high priest in the cult of Melkor. At this time, the Faithful (who still worshipped the one god, Eru Ilúvatar), were persecuted openly by those called the King&#x27;s Men, and were sacrificed in the name of Melkor. Eventually, Sauron convinced Ar-Pharazôn to invade Aman, promising him that he would thus obtain immortality. Amandil, chief of the Faithful, sailed westward to warn the Valar. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion prepared to flee eastwards, taking with them a seedling of the White Tree of Númenor before Sauron destroyed it, and the &quot;palantíri&quot;, gifts of the elves. When the King&#x27;s forces set foot on Aman, the Valar laid down their guardianship of the world and called on Ilúvatar to intervene.

The world was changed into a sphere and the continent of Aman was removed, although the Old Straight Road, a sailing route from Middle-earth to Aman, accessible to the Elves but not to mortals, persisted. Númenor was utterly destroyed, as was the fair body of Sauron; however, his spirit returned to Mordor, where he again took up the One Ring, and gathered his strength once more. Elendil, his sons and the remainder of the Faithful sailed to Middle-earth, where they founded the realms in exile of Gondor and Arnor.
Sauron arose again and challenged them. The Elves allied with Men to form the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. For seven years, the Alliance laid siege to Barad-dûr, until at last Sauron himself entered the field. He slew Elendil, High King of Gondor and Arnor, and Gil-galad, the last High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth. However, Isildur took up the hilt of Narsil, his father&#x27;s shattered sword, and cut the One Ring from Sauron&#x27;s hand. Sauron was defeated, but not utterly destroyed. Afterward, Isildur ignored the counsel of Elrond, and rather than destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, he kept it as weregild for his dead father. But the Ring betrayed him and slipped from his finger as he was escaping from an Orc ambush at the Gladden Fields. Isildur was killed by an orc arrow, and the Ring was lost in the Anduin River.

===Third Age===


The Third Age lasted for 3021 years, beginning with the first overthrow of Sauron at the hands of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men following the downfall of Númenor, and ending with the War of the Ring and final defeat of Sauron, the events narrated in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Virtually the entire history of the Third Age takes place in Middle-earth. The Third Age saw the rise in power of the realms of Arnor and Gondor, and their fall. Arnor was divided into three petty Kingdoms, which fell one by one in the wars with Sauron&#x27;s vassal kingdom of Angmar, whilst Gondor fell victim to Kin-strife, plague, Wainriders, and Corsairs. In this time, the line of the Kings of Gondor ends, with the House of the Stewards ruling in their stead. Meanwhile, the heirs of Isildur from the fallen kingdom of Arnor wander Middle-earth, aided only by Elrond in Rivendell; but the line of rightful heirs remains unbroken throughout the age.

This age was characterized by the waning of the Elves. In the beginning of the Third Age, many Elves left for Valinor because they were disturbed by the recent war. However, Elven kingdoms still survived in Lindon, Lothlórien, and Mirkwood. Rivendell also became a prominent haven for the Elves and other races. Throughout the Age, they chose not to mingle much in the matters of other lands, and only came to the aid of other races in time of war. The Elves devoted themselves to artistic pleasures, and tended to the lands which they occupied. The gradual decline of Elven populations occurred throughout the Age as the rise of Sauron came to dominate Middle-earth. By the end of the Third Age, only fragments of the once-grand Elven civilization survived in Middle-earth.

The Wizards arrived around a thousand years after the start of this period to aid the Free Peoples, most importantly Gandalf and Saruman. The One Ring was found by Sméagol but, under the power of the Ring and ignorant of its true nature, he retreated with the Ring to a secret life under the Misty Mountains. Middle-earth&#x27;s devastating Great Plague originated in its vast eastern region, Rhûn, where it caused considerable suffering. By the winter of late the Plague spread from Rhûn into Wilderland, on the east of Middle-earth&#x27;s western lands; in Wilderland it killed more than half the population. In the following year the Great Plague spread into Gondor and then Eriador. In Gondor the Plague caused many deaths, including King Telemnar, his children, and the White Tree; the population of the capital city Osgiliath was decimated, and government of the kingdom was transferred to Minas Tirith. In Eriador, the nascent Hobbit-realm of the Shire suffered &quot;great loss&quot; in what they called the Dark Plague.
The so-called Watchful Peace began in , when Gandalf went to Dol Guldur and the evil dwelling there (later known to be Sauron) fled to the far east. It lasted until , when Sauron returned with new strength. During this period Gondor strengthened its borders, keeping a watchful eye on the east, as Minas Morgul was still a threat on their flank and Mordor was still occupied with Orcs. There were minor skirmishes with Umbar. In the north, Arnor was long gone, but the Hobbits of the Shire prospered, getting their first Took Thain, and colonizing Buckland. The Dwarves of Durin&#x27;s folk under Thorin I abandoned Erebor, and left for the Grey Mountains, where most of their kin now gathered. Meanwhile, Sauron created a strong alliance between the tribes of Easterlings, so that when he returned he had many Men in his service.

The main events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; occur in . By the time of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Sauron had recovered, and was seeking the One Ring. The events of the ensuing War of the Ring leading to the end of the Third Age is the subject of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and summarized in &quot;Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age&quot;. After the defeat of Sauron, Aragorn takes his place as King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, restoring the line of Kings from the Stewards of Gondor. Aragorn marries the daughter of Elrond, Arwen, thus for the last time adding Elvish blood to the royal line. As the age ends, Gandalf, Frodo Baggins and many of the remaining Elves of Middle-earth sail from the Grey Havens to Aman.

=== Fourth Age ===


With the end of the Third Age began the Dominion of Men. Elves were no longer involved in Human affairs, and most Elves left for Valinor; those that remain behind &quot;fade&quot; and diminish. A similar fate meets the Dwarves: although Erebor becomes an ally of the Reunited Kingdom, there are indications that Khazad-dûm is refounded together with a colony established by Gimli in the White Mountains. Together, they disappear from human history.

Eldarion, son of Aragorn II Elessar and Arwen Evenstar, became King of the Reunited Kingdom in F.A. 120. Aragorn gave him the tokens of his rule, and then surrendered his life willingly, as his ancestors had done thousands of years before. Arwen left him to rule alone, passing away to the now-empty land of Lórien where she died. Upon the death of Aragorn, Legolas departed Middle-earth for Valinor, taking Gimli with him and ending the Fellowship of the Ring in Middle-earth.

Tolkien once considered writing a sequel to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, called &quot;The New Shadow&quot;, which would have taken place in Eldarion&#x27;s reign, and in which Eldarion deals with his people turning to evil practices – in effect, a repetition of the history of Númenor. In a 1972 letter concerning this draft, Tolkien mentioned that Eldarion&#x27;s reign would have lasted for about 100 years after the death of Aragorn. His realm was to be &quot;great and long-enduring&quot;, but the lifespan of the royal house was not to be restored; it would continue to wane until it was like that of ordinary Men.

=== Later Ages ===

Later Ages continue up to modern times, the remade Arda being equated with Earth. With the loss of all its peoples except Man, and the reshaping of the continents, all that is left of Middle-earth is a dim memory in folklore, legend, and old words. Tolkien estimated that the Fourth Age began approximately 6,000 years ago, and that we would now be in the 6th or 7th Age.

=== Dagor Dagorath ===

In a letter, Tolkien wrote that &quot;This legendarium [&quot;The Silmarillion&quot;] ends with a vision of the end of the world [after all the ages have elapsed], its breaking and remaking, and the recovery of the Silmarilli and the &#x27;light before the Sun&#x27; – after a final battle [Dagor Dagorath] which owes, I suppose, more to the Norse vision of than to anything else, though it is not much like it.&quot; The concept of Dagor Dagorath appears in many of Tolkien&#x27;s manuscripts that were published by his son Christopher in &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; series, but not in the published &quot;Silmarillion&quot;, where the eventual fate of Arda is left open-ended in the closing lines of the &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot;.

== Analysis ==

=== Creation and sub-creation ===

Scholars, noting that Tolkien was a devout Catholic, have stated that the &quot;Ainulindalë&quot; creation myth echoes the Christian account of creation. Brian Rosebury calls its prose &quot;appropriately &#x27;scriptural&#x27;&quot;. Verlyn Flieger cites Tolkien&#x27;s poem &quot;Mythopoeia&quot; (&quot;Creation of Myth&quot;), where he speaks of &quot;man, sub-creator, the refracted light / through whom is splintered from a single White / to many hues, and endlessly combined / in living shapes&quot;. She analyses in detail the successive splintering of the original created light, via the Two Lamps, the Two Trees, and the Silmarils, as the wills of different beings conflict. She states that for Tolkien, this creative light was equated with the Christian &quot;Logos&quot;, the Divine Word. Jane Chance remarks on the biblical theme of the conflict between the creator Eru Ilúvatar and the fallen Vala Melkor/Morgoth, mirroring that between God and Satan. Similarly, she notes, the struggles of Elves and Men corrupted by Morgoth and his spiritual descendant Sauron echo those of Adam and Eve tempted by Satan in the Garden of Eden, and the fall of man.

Flieger has observed that the splintering of the created light is a process of decline and fall from a once-perfect state. She identifies a theory of decline that influenced Tolkien, namely Owen Barfield&#x27;s theory of language in his 1928 book &quot;Poetic Diction&quot;. The central idea was that there was once a unified set of meanings in an ancient language, and that modern languages are derived from this by fragmentation of meaning. Tolkien took this to imply the separation of peoples, in particular the complicated and repeated sundering of the Elves.

=== A dark mythology ===

Scholars including Flieger have noted that if Tolkien intended to create a mythology for England, in the history of Arda as told in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; he had made it very dark. John Garth has identified his experiences in the First World War as formative; he began his Middle-earth writings at that time. Flieger suggests that Middle-earth arose not only from Tolkien&#x27;s own wartime experience, but out of that of his dead schoolfriends Geoffrey Bache Smith and Rob Gilson. Janet Brennan Croft writes that Tolkien&#x27;s first prose work after returning from the war was &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;, and that it is &quot;full of extended and terrifying scenes of battle&quot;; she notes that the streetfighting is described over 16 pages.

The Tolkien scholar Norbert Schürer notes the 2022 book &quot;The Fall of Númenor&quot; and the Amazon television series &quot;The Rings of Power&quot;, both about the Second Age, and asks what the period signifies for the legendarium as a whole. In his view, the period is problematic, having only one finished tale, the Atlantis-style &quot;Akallabêth&quot;. He proposes that Tolkien wanted to link the First Age (most of the content of the 1977 &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;) with the Third Age (of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;) by joining them together with a central period. In his view, this could not work for Tolkien, because the Second Age centred on &quot;the failure, decline, and corruption&quot; at the core of human life; Schürer argues that this was unacceptable to Tolkien as a Christian.

=== Greek mythology ===

Among the many influences that scholars have proposed as possibly important on the history of Arda is Greek mythology. The disappearance of the island of Númenor recalls Atlantis. The Valar borrow many attributes from the Olympian gods. Like the Olympians, the Valar live in the world, but on a high mountain, separated from mortals; Ulmo, Lord of the Waters, owes much to Poseidon, and Manwë, the Lord of the Air and King of the Valar, to Zeus. Tolkien compared Beren and Lúthien with Orpheus and Eurydice, but with the gender roles reversed. He mentioned Oedipus, too, in connection with Túrin in the &quot;Children of Húrin&quot;. Flieger has compared Fëanor with Prometheus: they are associated with fire, and are punished for rebelling against the gods&#x27; decrees.

=== &quot;Imagined prehistory&quot; ===

Arda is summed up by the Tolkien scholar Paul H. Kocher as &quot;our own green and solid Earth at some quite remote epoch in the past.&quot; Kocher notes Tolkien&#x27;s statement in the Prologue, equating Middle-earth with the actual Earth, separated by a long period of time:

In a letter written in 1958, Tolkien states that while the time is invented, the place, planet Earth, is not (italics in original):

In the same letter, he places the beginning of the Fourth Age some 6,000 years in the past:

The Tolkien scholar Richard C. West writes that one of the &quot;very final passages&quot; of the internal chronology of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;, ends not just with Arwen&#x27;s death, but the statement that her grave will remain on the hill of Cerin Amroth in what was Lothlorien &quot;until the world is changed, and all the days of her life are utterly forgotten by men that come after ... and with the passing of [Arwen] Evenstar no more is said in this book of the days of old.&quot; West observes that this points up a &quot;highly unusual&quot; aspect of Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium among modern fantasy: it is set &quot;in the real world but in an imagined prehistory.&quot; As a result, West explains, Tolkien can build what he likes in that distant past, elves and wizards and hobbits and all the rest, provided that he tears it all down again, so that the modern world can emerge from the wreckage, with nothing but &quot;a word or two, a few vague legends and confused traditions...&quot; to show for it.

West praises and quotes Kocher on Tolkien&#x27;s imagined prehistory and the implied process of fading to lead from fantasy to the modern world:

The Tolkien scholar Stuart D. Lee and the medievalist Elizabeth Solopova make &quot;an attempt at a summary&quot;, which runs as follows. The &quot;Silmarillion&quot; describes events &quot;presented as factual&quot; but taking place before Earth&#x27;s actual recorded history. What happened is processed through the generations as folk-myths and legends, especially among the (Old) English. Before the Fall of Númenor, the world was flat. In the Fall, it became round; further geological events reshaped the continents into the Earth as it now is. All the same, the old tales survive here and there, resulting in mentions of Dwarves and Elves in real Medieval literature. Thus, Tolkien&#x27;s imagined mythology &quot;is an attempt to reconstruct our pre-history.&quot; Lee and Solopova comment that &quot;Only by understanding this can we fully realize the true scale of his project and comprehend how enormous his achievement was.&quot;

The poet W. H. Auden wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;no previous writer has, to my knowledge, created an imaginary world and a feigned history in such detail. By the time the reader has finished the trilogy, including the appendices to this last volume, he knows as much about Tolkien&#x27;s Middle Earth, its landscape, its fauna and flora, its peoples, their languages, their history, their cultural habits, as, outside his special field, he knows about the actual world.&quot; The scholar Margaret Hiley comments that Auden&#x27;s &quot;feigned history&quot; echoes Tolkien&#x27;s own statement in the foreword to the second edition of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; that he much preferred history, true or feigned, to allegory; and that Middle-earth&#x27;s history is told in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

<doc id="802895" wikidata="Q17376040" url="?curid=802895" title="Private limited company">
<text>A private limited company is any type of business entity in &quot;private&quot; ownership used in many jurisdictions, in contrast to a publicly listed company, with some differences from country to country. Examples include the &quot;LLC&quot; in the United States, &quot;private company limited by shares&quot; in the United Kingdom, &quot;GmbH&quot; in Germany and Austria, (BV) in The Netherlands and Belgium, (SARL) in France, (S.r.l.) in Italy, and (SRL) in the Spanish-speaking world. The benefit of having a private limited company is that there is limited liability.

== Abbreviations ==
==Albania==
In Albania, a limited liability company () is a commercial company founded by persons of physical or judicial status, who are not liable for the company and personally bear losses only up to the outstanding contribution agreements. Partners&#x27; contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company. Each partner has his quota in the company in proportion to the contribution of the capital so the registered capital of the company is divided between the partners based on the proportional ratio of their contribution. In Albania a limited liability company may not have a capital of less than 100 lek.

==Argentina==
Although not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called &quot;Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.)&quot; and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called &quot;shares&quot;), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law N° 19550 and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.

== Bolivia ==
In Bolivia, the LLC variant is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.). These companies&#x27; legal framework consist in the Trade Code (Decree Law N° 14379 of February 25, 1977), its modifications and other supplementary laws. The members participate in it through capital stakes, and their liability is limited to the value of their contributions. The number of members must be minimum 2 and maximum 25.

==Bosnia and Herzegovina==
Bosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia contemplates LLCs as &quot;društvo s ograničenom odgovornošću&quot; (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name. A shareholder or member in a d.o.o. is only personally liable up to the value of the member&#x27;s investment in the company.

==Brazil==
The corporate structure in Brazilian law most similar to the American LLC is the &quot;Sociedade Limitada&quot; (&quot;Ltda.&quot;), under the new Brazilian Civil Code of 2002. The &quot;sociedade limitada&quot; is the new name of the &quot;sociedade por quotas de responsabilidade limitada&quot;, and it can be organized as &quot;empresária&quot; or &quot;simples&quot;, under this new code, roughly corresponding to the form types of &quot;comercial&quot; (&quot;commercial&quot;) and &quot;civil&quot; (&quot;non commercial&quot;) of the Commercial Code. A new law in Brazil has made it legal to obtain an LLC by a sole-proprietor in two forms: &quot;Empresa Individual de Responsabilidade Limitada&quot; (&quot;Eireli&quot; for short), or &quot;Sociedade Unipessoal Limitada&quot; (&quot;Ltda.&quot;). The main requirement for an Eireli is a capital of 100 times the current minimum wage, R$ 78.800,00 (US$26.267.00) as of 2015; whereas for a &quot;Sociedade Unipessoal Limitada&quot; the same rules apply as for other &quot;Sociedades Limitadas&quot; 

==Bulgaria==
Bulgarian legislation corresponds LLCs (Ltd, GmbH, SARL, etc.) as &quot;Дружество с ограничена отговорност&quot; (&quot;Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost&quot;; company with limited liability). Companies incorporated under this structure append the cyrillic abbreviation &quot;ООД&quot; (Latin script: OOD) to their name. In the case of an LLC incorporated with a sole-shareholder/member (sole-ownership), this is designated and known as &quot;Еднолично дружество с ограничена отговорност&quot; (&quot;Ednolichno druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost&quot;; sole-ownership company with limited liability) and abbreviated as &quot;ЕООД&quot; (EOOD). The EOOD specifically, is exempted from annual, general or extraordinary meetings for making decisions and may just issue written resolutions.

==Colombia==
Colombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The &quot;Ltda.&quot; abbreviation is also used in Colombia.

==Croatia==
In Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed &quot;društvo s ograničenom odgovornošću&quot; (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated &quot;d.o.o.&quot;. A public limited liability company is termed a &quot;dioničko društvo&quot; (literal: joint stock company) abbreviated &quot;d.d.&quot;.

==Czechia==
Czech legislation contemplates LLCs as &quot;společnost s ručením omezeným&quot; (&quot;s.r.o.&quot; or &quot;spol. s r.o.&quot;). An &quot;s.r.o.&quot; is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (&quot;jednatel&quot;, mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.

==Denmark==
The Danish form of the LLC is the &quot;kommanditselskab&quot; (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the &quot;komplementar&quot; which is fully liable, and the &quot;kommanditist&quot; which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income &quot;passes through&quot; the company directly to the shareholders.

==Dominican Republic==
Dominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as &quot;Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada&quot;, also known by their abbreviation &quot;S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.

==Estonia==
The Estonian version of private limited company (limited liability company) is called &quot;osaühing&quot; (OÜ). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name.
An OÜ is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is €2,500.

==Finland==
Although not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy () or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. Since 1 July 2019, there is no minimum capital required by law.

==Germany==
Because of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of (GmbH) because it has aspects of a corporation; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of &quot;Kommanditgesellschaft&quot; (KG), which is the German equivalent of a limited partnership. Based on the literal translation of the word &quot;company&quot;, an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is GmbH &amp; Co KG, a nested Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) where a (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the Bundesfinanzministerium (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a &quot;corporation&quot; or as a &quot;limited partnership&quot;. It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.

==Greece==
A limited liability company (LLC) in Greece is synonymous to an EPE (ΕΠΕ - Εταιρεία Περιορισμένης Ευθύνης).

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, the Limited Company is the most commonly incorporated type of company and bears the characteristics of a Limited Liability Company. The core characteristics of a Hong Kong Limited Company include: i) it requires a minimum of one shareholder and one director (can be the same person), ii) a Hong Kong company requires a company secretary resident in HK, iii) foreign ownership is allowed, iv) company shareholders have limited liability and v) the company must have registered HK address.

Entrepreneurs who register a company in Hong Kong can choose a Hong Kong offshore company. This company structure is basically a HK Limited Company but all business is conducted outside of Hong Kong. The advantage of this structure is that all business income that is sourced outside of Hong Kong is tax exempt.

==Hungary==
Hungarian legislation contemplates LLCs as &quot;korlátolt felelősségű társaság&quot;. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation &quot;Kft.&quot; to their name (spelled capitalized as part of the name). Hungarian LLCs are required to have a 3 million HUF (Hungarian forint; approx. US$) starting capital. The time of formation by the new electronic formation option has been reduced from 2 weeks to 2 hours, additional cost of formation is around 100,000 HUF (approx. US$). Kft.s can be formed by the cooperation of lawyers.

The Hungarian kft. is the most common form of doing business in Hungary. As being part of the European Union (EU), Hungarian kft.s can now obtain an EU VAT registration number for doing business across the EU. The Hungarian EU-VAT reg. number starts with &quot;HU&quot;. This way the existence of the subject company, VAT issues and the cross-check is available on the common EU website for companies.

== Iceland ==
According to Icelandic legislation, there are two main types of LLC forms, private and public held limited liability forms. Private LLC is abbreviated &quot;Ehf.&quot; The minimum capital of 500,000 Icelandic krónas (kr.). Public LLC is abbreviated &quot;Hf.&quot; with minimum capital of 4,000,000 kr.

==Iran==
As of 2015, there are seven types of companies which can be registered under Iran&#x27;s company registration law. One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage. LLPs in Iran are named according to the format illustrated by the following example: &quot;Sherkat Ba Masooliyate Mahdood&quot; translates as &quot;Sherkat شرکت Company&quot; + &quot;Mahdood محدود Limited&quot; + &quot;Masooliyat مسئولیت Liability&quot;.

==Italy==
The Italian Civil Code, approved in 1942 and as amended by the Government Act 6/2003 and furthers modifications, mainly provides three forms of limited liability company:
* &quot;Società per azioni&quot; (S.p.A.): the minimum required starting capital for an SpA is €50,000. The capital is divided into shares (azioni) that can be transferred by endorsement or bought and sold on stock exchange. Only SpAs can be quoted in stock exchange market, issue corporate bonds, and other financial instruments. SpA form and a higher capital are required by law to operate in protected businesses (i.e. banks, leasing companies, etc.).
* &quot;Società a responsabilità limitata&quot; (Srl): the minimum required starting capital for an Srl is €10,000. Its capital is divided into stakes (quote) which can be bought or sold just by notarial act. Srls can issue corporate bonds but are subject to many limitations. Similar to the Srl is the Società Cooperativa a Responsabilità Limitata (Scarl) whose scope is not making profit but give benefits to stakes&#x27; holders.
* &quot;Società in accomandita per azioni&quot; (Sapa): the minimum required starting capital for a Sapa is €120,000 divided into shares. Sapas have a mixed liability scheme, where standard shareholders have limited liability while managing shareholders have full liability. Except this, SAPAs are exactly like SPAs even if uncommon.

Companies append the corresponding abbreviation to their company names.

==Japan==
Japan passed legislation in 1996 creating a new type of business organization, godo kaisha (J-LLC), a close variant of the American LLC. Japanese Tax authority does not consider J-LLC (Godo-Kaisha) a pass-through entity, but as a taxable entity.

== Latvia ==
Limited liability company in Latvia is referred to as &quot;sabiedrība ar ierobežotu atbildību&quot; (SIA). SIA is taxed as a corporation. The minimum share capital required by law is €2,800. But it is allowed to set up SIA with share capital €1.00, but it must be increased to minimum share capital €2,800 by increasing share capital with money or by moving at least 25% from annual profit until capital will be €2,800.

Mexican legislation contemplates LLCs as &quot;Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada&quot; (including &quot;Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada de Capital Variable&quot;), also known for their abbreviation &quot;S. de R.L.&quot; (or &quot;S de R.L. de C.V.&quot;) (&quot;limited liability company&quot; or &quot;limited liability company with/of variable capital&quot;). S. de R.L.&#x27;s award limited liability to its members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital) and also act as pass-through or flow-through entities whereby profits are &quot;passed-through&quot; to its members, avoiding double taxation. This type of company is widely used by foreign investors in Mexico because of its &quot;pass-through&quot; modality and its &quot;check the box&quot; capability under the IRC (Internal Revenue Code of the U.S.).

==Moldova==
Moldovan legislation contemplates LLCs as &quot;Societate cu Răspundere Limitată&quot;, abbreviated &quot;S.R.L.&quot;, and are regulated member(s)-founder(s), and other non-founder members, minimum one member-founder and maximum total of 50 members, at least one of them must be the founder of the company, but all of the 50 could be also founders.

==North Macedonia==

Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation &quot;д.о.о.&quot; (&quot;d.o.o.&quot;) to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d.o.o. is €5,000.

==Norway==
In Norway, the closest to an LLC is probably the &quot;kommandittselskap&quot; (KS). In a K/S there are two types of participants, one &quot; komplementar&quot; which is fully liable, and one or more &quot;kommandittist&quot;, with limited liability. There are minimum capital requirements. The KS is a tax-transparent company, which means the income &quot;passes through&quot; the company directly to the shareholders.

There is no direct equivalent of an LLC in Peru, but some similar corporate forms include:

* &quot;Sociedad anónima cerrada&quot; (S.A.C.), a corporation which must have at least two and not more than twenty shareholders; its shares may not be offered to the public and cannot be traded on the stock exchange.
* &quot;Sociedad comercial de responsabilidad limitada&quot; (S.R.L.), a commercial partnership divided in equal participations which may not be called &quot;shares&quot;. It must have at least two and not more than twenty partners.
* &quot;Sociedad civil de responsabilidad limitada&quot; (S. Civil de R. L.), a professional partnership of at least two and not more than thirty individuals, with co-owner participation in the form of capital, of professional contribution, or of any combination of both.
* &quot;Empresa individual de responsabilidad limitada&quot; (E.I.R.L.), a legal entity with one single owner.

The capital for any of the above entities is freely determined by its statutes. There is no minimum requirement except for entities with certain types of activities, mainly in the financial markets, and then irrespective of their type.

==Poland==
In Poland, a limited liability company is referred to literally as &quot;company with limited liability&quot; (), legally abbreviated as &quot;sp. z o.o.&quot; (or sometimes &quot;Sp. z o.o.&quot; in particular names). Informally, in the Polish speaking slang, it is abbreviated as &quot;spółka zoo&quot; (pronounced with a long &quot;o&quot;, as in &quot;tow.&quot;). However, &quot;sp. z o.o.&quot; has a (separate from its owners) legal personality, which gives it the ability to do certain actions under law, and it is considered a &quot;corporation&quot;.

The minimum start capital is 5,000 PLN (since 2009; until then, 50,000 PLN).

==Portugal==
In Portugal, LLCs are called &quot;Sociedades por Quotas&quot;, that is, &quot;company by shares&quot;, usually abbreviated &quot;Lda.&quot;. They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, since 2006 the transference of them is not required to be done in the presence of a civil law notary, except if the company owns buildings, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and there is no minimum capital required by law for a &quot;Lda.&quot; in excess of the minimum value of €1 per share, and thus per partner.
The capital is not required to be deposited at the time of the registration of the company, instead the share holders have until 31 December of the year the registry was made. 

==Romania==
Romania recognizes the limited liability company since 1990 under the name of &quot;societate cu răspundere limitată&quot; (S.R.L.), in which the owners are personally liable for the company obligations within the limit of their contribution to social capital. The minimum start capital is no longer 200 RON, it was reduced to 1 RON which currently amounts to less than €0.2.

==Russia==
In Russia and certain other former Soviet countries, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as Obshchestvo s ogranichennoy otvetstvennost&#x27;yu (lit., &quot;company with limited liability&quot;), usually abbreviated OOO, or in some CIS countries as OcOO.

Although a Russian limited liability company shares the same name with an American LLC, it is different in many ways. Most importantly, a Russian LLC is not tax transparent: the company is taxed at the corporate level, and then, upon distribution of dividends, shareholders pay income tax (personal or corporate).

A limited liability company is the most popular form of legal undertaking in Russia for simple shareholding structures.

The minimum capital required is 10,000 Russian rubles.

Also, the Russia have Closed Action Company - &quot;Закрытое Акционерное Общество&quot; 26.12.1995 N 208 - The Law of Federation &quot;(about) Action Company&quot; or &quot;Joint-stock company&quot; or &quot;The limited liability company have stock or share&quot; 12.26.1995 N 208, as Closed Joint-stock company and Open Joint-stock company.
A Closed Joint-stock company such as a Limited Liability Company. But they have a difference that a stockholder may to bear out own portion, as capital, from the Limited Liability Company, but a stockholder of Closed Joint-stock company may to bear out own portion only as money.
The minimum capital required is 10,000 Russian rubles by Closed Joint-stock company. 
The minimum capital required is 100,000 Russian rubles by Open Joint-stock company.

==Serbia==
Serbia legislation contemplates limited company as Друштво са ограниченом одговорношћу but functioning it is more similar to limited partnership. For many other reasons for example as in the Czech Republic, a &quot;d.o.o.&quot; is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. The minimum capital required by law is 100 RSD, which is currently less than €1.

==Slovakia==
In Slovakia, the law contemplates &quot;spoločnosť s ručením obmedzeným&quot; (abbreviation &quot;spol. s r. o.&quot; or &quot;s. r. o.&quot;) or as the rough equivalent of a limited liability company. It is very popular form of business organization due to ensurance of limited liability in exchange for a relatively small investment into the registered capital. From one to 50 associates can found it through a founding agreement with minimum registered capital of €5000, minimum €750 per person, in money or other property. (§ 105–153 of Act. No 513/1991 Coll. – Commercial Code as amended.)

==Slovenia==
Slovenian legislation contemplates LLCs as &quot;družba z omejeno odgovornostjo&quot;. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation &quot;d. o. o.&quot; to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a &quot;d. o. o.&quot; is €7,500. Due to the high cost and complicated bookkeeping of a real corporation, this is a more widespread form.

==Spain==
In Spain, LLCs are called &quot;Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada&quot; (SRL), &quot;company of limited responsibility&quot;, or &quot;sociedad limitada&quot; (SL), or &quot;limited partnership&quot;. They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, the transference of them having to be done compulsorily in the presence of a civil law notary, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a &quot;S.L.&quot; is at least €3,000.

==Sweden==
Sweden has no equivalent of an LLC. The closest company form is the &quot;handelsbolag&quot; (lit.: &quot;trade company&quot;). The Swedish AB (&quot;aktiebolag&quot;; lit.: &quot;share company&quot;), like the &quot;handelsbolag&quot;, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in a private company, &quot;privat aktiebolag&quot;, is SEK 25,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. The AB structure requires shareholders, a board of directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year. Depending on the size of the AB, the accounts may have to be audited. Creation or purchase &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created &quot;aktiebolag&quot; can be an expensive and time-consuming operation. Creation of public limited liability companies, or &quot;publikt aktiebolag&quot;, which can raise capital from the public, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 500,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.

==Switzerland==
The Swiss Code of Obligations provides for different kinds of companies with limited liability, the two most commonly used are:

Swiss Limited Liability Company: The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German &quot;Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung&quot; (abbreviation: &quot;GmbH&quot;), in French &quot;Société à responsabilité limitée&quot; (abbreviation: &quot;S.à r.l.&quot; or &quot;SARL&quot;) and in Italian &quot;Società a Garanzia Limitata&quot; (abbreviation: &quot;SaGL&quot;). A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs, the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC&#x27;s obligations is limited to its capital contribution, a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed, and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the members’ right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest. The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.

Swiss Corporation (in English common law context usually translated as &quot; company limited by shares&quot;): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German &quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (abbreviation: &quot;AG&quot;), in French &quot;Société Anonyme&quot; (abbreviation: &quot;SA&quot;) and in Italian &quot;Società Anonima&quot; (abbreviation: &quot;SA&quot;). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties. Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares) and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.

==Tajikistan==
In Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as &quot;Ҷамъияти дорои масъулияти маҳдуд&quot;, Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as &quot;ҶДММ&quot;.

==Thailand==
Most kinds of commercial organisations with an annual turnover of more than ฿1,800,000.00 are supposed to register a Limited Company with verified capital of at least ฿1,800,000.00 and pay VAT sales tax.
The process of incorporation is however complex and needs to be prepared by an accredited law firm or accountant. It includes the registration for VAT. The company registration number is the same as the Tax ID number which must then figure on all invoices and sales receipts with VAT breakdown shown separately. For most purposes, foreign nationals are not permitted to be share holders or declared board members although there are exceptions for very high level investors.

==Turkey==
Minimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. Şti. (Which means &quot;Limited Şirketi.)&quot;

==Ukraine==
This type of entity has existed in Ukraine since the 1990s. LLC is the most common type of business entity in Ukraine. In Ukrainian, it is spelled &quot;Товариство з обмеженою відповідальністю&quot; (abbreviated – TОВ, TзОВ), in transliteration &quot;Tovarystvo z Obmezhenoyu Vidpovidalnistyu,&quot; that is, &quot;company with limited liability&quot;.

By Ukrainian law LLC is a legal person. Authorized capital of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) hryvnia (less than 0,04 US cents). There is no state fee for LLC formation.

By Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of company&#x27;s income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement. Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.

Taxation. &quot;LLC can be registered:&quot;

* as corporate/profit tax (18% rate) with or without VAT (up to 20% rate, depends on product or service) tax payer;
* fixed tax rate (in transliteration &quot;yediniy podatok&quot; or &quot;sproschena sistema opodatkuvannia&quot;) is a 5% rate from revenue, with or without (on request) VAT registration.

==United Arab Emirates==
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. 
Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals. In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company&#x27;s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public. Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLCs are not allowed to practice their activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.

==United Kingdom==
The new form of limited liability partnership (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including VAT. Otherwise, all companies, including limited companies and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to United Kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.

==United States==
In the United States, the term &quot;privately held company&quot; can either refer to a limited liability company or a corporation. By default, all corporations are privately held. Corporations have to get permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer shares to the public. As a result, all newly formed corporations are automatically classified as privately owned.

One of the big differences between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation is that a corporation can issue stock and an LLC cannot. LLCs are structured like a partnership, whereas a corporation is structured like a private limited company.

A limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statutes. The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH (&quot;Company with limited liability&quot;), a type of business organization in Germany, and by the , a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.

In the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in Wyoming in 1977 as special interest legislation for an oil company. In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes. However, later that year, the IRS proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entity&#x27;s liabilities. In 1982, Florida adopted an LLC act modeled on Wyoming&#x27;s LLC Act. Due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of LLCs, no other states introduced LLC legislation until after 1988. In 1988, the IRS issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a Wyoming-style LLC as a partnership for tax purposes. By 1996, nearly every state had enacted an LLC statute. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act in 1996 and revised it in 2006.

A potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state&#x27;s courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly Delaware for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business. Of course, this could also be considered an advantage for a party that would prefer to remain in state court in instances where the opposing party seeks to remove a matter to federal court.

AOL was set up as an LLC during its ownership by Time Warner from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for BMW&#x27;s American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. Chrysler has been an LLC since restructuring during the auto industry bailout of 2009, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.

<text>In ionizing radiation detection physics, a semiconductor detector is a device that uses a semiconductor (usually silicon or germanium) to measure the effect of incident charged particles or photons.

Semiconductor detectors find broad application for radiation protection, gamma and X-ray spectrometry, and as particle detectors.

== Detection mechanism ==
In semiconductor detectors, ionizing radiation is measured by the number of charge carriers set free in the detector material which is arranged between two electrodes, by the radiation. Ionizing radiation produces free electrons and electron holes. The number of electron-hole pairs is proportional to the energy of the radiation to the semiconductor. As a result, a number of electrons are transferred from the valence band to the conduction band, and an equal number of holes are created in the valence band. Under the influence of an electric field, electrons and holes travel to the electrodes, where they result in a pulse that can be measured in an outer circuit, as described by the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The holes travel in the opposite direction and can also be measured. As the amount of energy required to create an electron-hole pair is known, and is independent of the energy of the incident radiation, measuring the number of electron-hole pairs allows the energy of the incident radiation to be determined.

The energy required to produce electron-hole-pairs is very low compared to the energy required to produce paired ions in a gas detector. Consequently, in semiconductor detectors the statistical variation of the pulse height is smaller and the energy resolution is higher. As the electrons travel fast, the time resolution is also very good, and is dependent upon rise time. Compared with gaseous ionization detectors, the density of a semiconductor detector is very high, and charged particles of high energy can give off their energy in a semiconductor of relatively small dimensions.

== Detector types ==
=== Silicon detectors ===
Most silicon particle detectors work, in principle, by doping narrow (usually around 100 micrometers wide) silicon strips to turn them into diodes, which are then reverse biased. As charged particles pass through these strips, they cause small ionization currents that can be detected and measured. Arranging thousands of these detectors around a collision point in a particle accelerator can yield an accurate picture of what paths particles take. Silicon detectors have a much higher resolution in tracking charged particles than older technologies such as cloud chambers or wire chambers. The drawback is that silicon detectors are much more expensive than these older technologies and require sophisticated cooling to reduce leakage currents (noise source). They also suffer degradation over time from radiation, however, this can be greatly reduced thanks to the Lazarus effect.

=== Diamond detectors ===
Diamond detectors have many similarities with silicon detectors but are expected to offer significant advantages – in particular a high radiation hardness and very low drift currents. They are also suited to neutron detection. At present, however, they are much more expensive and more difficult to manufacture.

=== Germanium detectors ===
Germanium detectors are mostly used for gamma spectroscopy in nuclear physics, as well as x-ray spectroscopy. While silicon detectors cannot be thicker than a few millimeters, germanium can have a sensitive layer (depletion region) thickness of centimeters, and therefore can be used as a total absorption detector for gamma rays up to a few MeV. These detectors are also called high-purity germanium detectors (HPGe) or hyperpure germanium detectors. Before current purification techniques were refined, germanium crystals could not be produced with purity sufficient to enable their use as spectroscopy detectors. Impurities in the crystals trap electrons and holes, ruining the performance of the detectors. Consequently, germanium crystals were doped with lithium ions (Ge(Li)), in order to produce an intrinsic region in which the electrons and holes would be able to reach the contacts and produce a signal.

When germanium detectors were first developed, only very small crystals were available. Low efficiency was the result, and germanium detector efficiency is still often quoted in relative terms to a &quot;standard&quot; 3″ x 3″ NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. Crystal growth techniques have since improved, allowing detectors to be manufactured that are as large as or larger than commonly available NaI crystals, although such detectors cost more than €100,000 (US$113,000).

, HPGe detectors commonly use lithium diffusion to make an n+ ohmic contact, and boron implantation to make a p+ contact. Coaxial detectors with a central n+ contact are referred to as n-type detectors, while p-type detectors have a p+ central contact. The thickness of these contacts represents a dead layer around the surface of the crystal within which energy depositions do not result in detector signals. The central contact in these detectors is opposite to the surface contact, making the dead layer in n-type detectors smaller than the dead layer in p-type detectors. Typical dead layer thicknesses are several hundred micrometers for a Li diffusion layer and a few tenths of a micrometer for a B implantation layer.

The major drawback of germanium detectors is that they must be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures to produce spectroscopic data. At higher temperatures, the electrons can easily cross the band gap in the crystal and reach the conduction band, where they are free to respond to the electric field, producing too much electrical noise to be useful as a spectrometer. Cooling to liquid nitrogen temperature (77K) reduces thermal excitations of valence electrons so that only a gamma ray interaction can give an electron the energy necessary to cross the band gap and reach the conduction band. Cooling with liquid nitrogen is inconvenient, as the detector requires hours to cool down to operating temperature before it can be used, and cannot be allowed to warm up during use. Ge(Li) crystals could never be allowed to warm up, as the lithium would drift out of the crystal, ruining the detector. HPGe detectors can be allowed to warm up to room temperature when not in use.

Commercial systems became available that use advanced refrigeration techniques (for example pulse tube refrigerator) to eliminate the need for liquid nitrogen cooling.

Germanium detectors with multi-strip electrodes, orthogonal on opposing faces, can indicate the 2-D location of the ionization trail within a large single crystal of Ge. Detectors like this have been used in COSI balloon-born astronomy missions (NASA, 2016) and will be used in an orbital observatory (NASA, 2025) Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI).

Because germanium detectors are highly efficient in photon detection, they can be used for a variety of additional applications. High-purity germanium detectors are used by Homeland Security to differentiate between naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) and weaponized or otherwise harmful radioactive material. They are also used in monitering the environment due to the concern of the use of nuclear power. Finally, high-purity germanium detectors are used for medical imaging and nuclear physics research, making them a rather diverse detector as far as applications go. 

=== Cadmium telluride and cadmium zinc telluride detectors ===
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors have been developed for use in X-ray spectroscopy and gamma spectroscopy. The high density of these materials means they can effectively attenuate X-rays and gamma-rays with energies of greater than 20 keV that traditional silicon-based sensors are unable to detect. The wide band gap of these materials also means they have high resistivity and are able to operate at, or close to, room temperature (~295K) unlike germanium-based sensors. These detector materials can be used to produce sensors with different electrode structures for imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy. However, CZT detectors are generally unable to match the resolution of germanium detectors, with some of this difference being attributable to poor positive charge-carrier transport to the electrode. Efforts to mitigate this effect have included the development of novel electrodes to negate the need for both polarities of carriers to be collected.

== Integrated Systems ==
Semiconductor detectors are often commercially integrated into larger systems for various radiation measurement applications.

=== Automated Sample Changing for Germanium Detectors ===
Gamma spectrometers using HPGe detectors are often used for measurement of low levels of gamma-emitting radionuclides in environmental samples, which requires a low background environment, usually achieved by enclosing the sample and detector in a lead shield known as a &#x27;lead castle&#x27;. Automated systems have been developed to sequentially move a number of samples into and out of the lead castle for measurement. Due to the complexities of opening the shield and moving the samples, this automation has traditionally been expensive, but lower-cost autosamplers have recently been introduced.

=== Radioactive Waste Assay Machines ===
Semiconductor detectors especially HPGe are often integrated into devices for characterising packaged radioactive waste. This can be as simple as detectors being mounted on a moveable platform to be brought to an area for in-situ measurements and paired with shielding to restrict the field-of-view of the detector to the area of interest for one-shot &quot;open detector geometry&quot; measurements, or for waste in drums, systems such as the Segmented Gamma Scanner (SGS) combine a semiconductor detector with integrated mechatronics to rotate the item and scan the detector across different sections. If the detector field of view is scanned across small areas of the item in multiple axes as is done with a Tomographic Gamma Scanner (TGS), Tomography can be used to extract 3D information about the density and gamma emissions of the item.

=== Gamma Cameras ===
Semiconductor detectors are used in some Gamma Cameras and Gamma imaging systems

<doc id="802927" wikidata="Q1387192" url="?curid=802927" title="Roman Turek">
<text>Roman Turek (born May 21, 1970) is a Czech former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Dallas Stars, St. Louis Blues and Calgary Flames in a nine-year National Hockey League (NHL) career. He last played in the Czech Extraliga for HC České Budějovice.

==Playing career==

===Dallas Stars===
Drafted 113th overall by the Minnesota North Stars in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, Turek moved with the franchise to Dallas, where he initially played as the third-string goaltender behind Andy Moog and Artūrs Irbe before serving as the backup to Ed Belfour. He won a Stanley Cup in this role in 1999. Despite his backup role, he achieved international glory with the Czech Republic national team, backstopping them to a gold medal at the 1996 World Championships. In this year, he also played in Germany for the Nürnberg Ice Tigers.

===St. Louis Blues===
The Stars, fearing they would lose Turek to the Atlanta Thrashers in the upcoming expansion draft, traded him to the St. Louis Blues in the 1999 off-season, and Turek finally got his chance to shine as he topped the league with seven shutouts and won the William M. Jennings Trophy in his first season. He helped the Blues to the Presidents&#x27; Trophy that year and the Blues entered the playoffs with high expectations. However, St. Louis was eliminated in seven games by the eighth-seeded San Jose Sharks, with some aggravated Blues fans pinning responsibility on Turek because of some soft goals he allowed, including one in game 7 that was fired from centre ice by Sharks captain Owen Nolan. However, he played a second season with the Blues while being challenged for the starting position by backup Brent Johnson. He put up good numbers again, this time helping the Blues reach the playoffs as the fourth seed, where they again faced the Sharks in the first round. This time, Turek helped the Blues eliminate the Sharks in six games and then helped them sweep the Dallas Stars, his former team, in the second round. However, in the third round against the Colorado Avalanche, soft goals plagued him again (including one scored after an attempt to scoop the puck into his glove with his stick) and again in some fan circles bore the brunt of the blame for the Blues&#x27; third round 4–1 ouster.

===Calgary Flames===

In the off-season, Turek was traded to the Calgary Flames.

In the 2003–04 season, Turek&#x27;s status as the Flames&#x27; starting goaltender was altered drastically when, following an injury to Turek, Darryl Sutter traded a conditional draft pick to the San Jose Sharks for Miikka Kiprusoff. Though he struggled in San Jose, Kiprusoff&#x27;s stellar performances in Calgary relegated Turek to the bench. However, Turek was a dependable backup, as Kiprusoff led the Flames to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning.

In 2004, Turek restructured his contract to substantially drop his salary from $5 million plus bonuses for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons. The restructuring brought his salary to between $1 million and $2 million, with potential earnings relying heavily on performance bonuses. The restructuring saved the Calgary Flames organization between $3 million and $4 million in the 2004–05 season.

Turek announced his retirement from the NHL on August 9, 2005.

==International play==
* 1994 Played for Czech Republic at 1994 Winter Olympics

<doc id="802932" wikidata="Q2311035" url="?curid=802932" title="Vaal Triangle">
<text>The Vaal Triangle is a triangular area formed by Vereeniging, Vanderbijlpark and Sasolburg about 60 km south of Johannesburg, South Africa. The area forms a substantial urban complex. Meyerton, just north of Vereeniging, is also sometimes included in the complex, and residents of Sharpeville, Boipatong, Bophelong, the greater Sebokeng area (including Evaton), Three Rivers, Heidelberg and Deneysville also generally tend to consider themselves to live in the Vaal Triangle. The area straddles the Vaal River and is a major industrial region, which is home to former Iron and Steel Corporation Iscor, now ArcelorMittal South Africa, and Sasol, respectively the steel and petrochemical processing facilities.

== Pollution ==
Due to the heavy industries in and around the Vaal Triangle it has become infamous for its air pollution and respiratory disease. According to an analysis by OpenAQ, the area regularly registers the highest concentration of PM2.5 particulate pollution worldwide.
In 2013, research by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) revealed that areas in the Vaal Triangle have persistently higher concentrations of air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, than in the rest of South Africa. For this reason, local Afrikaans speaking people often refer to the region as the &quot;Vuil Driehoek&quot; (meaning &quot;Dirty Triangle&quot;) as a pun on &quot;Vaal Driehoek&quot; (the Afrikaans translation for Vaal Triangle).
== Tourism and recreation ==

Nearby is the Vaal Dam, from which the massive PWV megalopolis (Pretoria, Witwatersrand and Vereeniging) draws its water. The PWV forms the urban heart of Gauteng province. The Witwatersrand is the name given to the area that comprises the Greater Johannesburg metropole and the gold-bearing reef along which gold was discovered in 1886.

The Vaal Dam is well-patronised by people from Johannesburg over the weekends and during holidays, as it provides extensive water recreation facilities some 70 km south of the city.

<text>Steve Silver&#x27;s Beach Blanket Babylon was the world&#x27;s longest-running musical revue. The show began its run in 1974, at the Savoy Tivoli and later moved to the larger Club Fugazi in the North Beach district of San Francisco.

The show was created by Steve Silver (1944–1995) along with sisters, native San Franciscans, Roberta and Nancy Bleiweiss. The three started on the streets of San Francisco. Nancy was the star of the show, created her characters and wrote all her own dialogue for all her characters for The Valentine Show (which preceded BBB at the Savoy Tivoli) in Beach Blanket Babylon and Beach Blanket Babylon Goes Bananas, Roberta was the show&#x27;s manager, Associate Director, Promotion and Publicity Director, Box Office Manager (She made the original tickets for the show (that performed at the Savoy Tivoli) on a copy machine, cut them with scissors and sold the tickets for $2.50 from her home, as a make-shift box office. She then took the tickets to the Tivoli and sold tickets at the door before getting ready to also be a performer in the original show), procured sponsors for the original shows, did the accounting and wrote checks and also performed in the original shows at Savoy Tivoli, Olympus, Dance Your Ass Off and Club Fugazi. 

The character of Snow White did not appear in the original shows. It wasn&#x27;t until the two sisters were no longer in the show that the show title changed to Beach Blanket Babylon Goes to the Stars.
 and continued since 1995 under the direction of his widow, Jo Schuman Silver, with frequent changes and spoofs of pop and political culture. Performers wear disproportionately large hats/wigs and gaudy costumes while performing satirical renditions of popular songs.

On April 17, 2019, Jo Schuman Silver announced to the staff that the show would be closing on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

== Plot summary ==
The original Beach Blanket Babylon (started in 1974) and Beach Blanket Babylon Goes Bananas (that started in 1975) evolved from the street group that Roberta and Nancy Bleiweiss and Steve Silver performed on the streets of San Francisco during the early 70s when street artists made a living performing.&#x27;Beach Blanket Babylon Goes to the Stars&#x27; did not start until the late 70s. It follows Snow White as she takes a fast-paced journey around the world in search of her &quot;Prince Charming&quot;. Along the way she encounters a large group of figures from popular culture, who together perform satirical songs. Figures lampooned include politicians and political figures from the San Francisco, California and U.S. governments, film and television stars, famous singers and athletes, and others who have been in the news. Also present are long-running characters such as Glinda the Good Witch, Mr. Peanut, Louis XIV, Oprah Winfrey, James Brown, Tina Turner, Carmen Miranda, Elvis Presley, a band of dancing French Poodles, and Snow White&#x27;s tour guide, a female narrator who takes on several incarnations from an Italian pizza lady to a cowgirl.

<text>HTC–Highroad () was a former professional cycling team competing in international road bicycle races. Their last title sponsor was HTC Corporation, a Taiwanese manufacturer of smartphones but dissolved at the end of the 2011 season from a failure to find a new sponsor. High Road Sports was the management company of team manager Bob Stapleton. Past title sponsors include Columbia Sportswear and Deutsche Telekom.

The team was founded in 1991 as Team Telekom, sponsored by Deutsche Telekom. In 2004 their name changed to the T-Mobile Team. The team was under the management of Bob Stapleton and Rolf Aldag. Former leaders included Olaf Ludwig, Walter Godefroot and Eddy Vandenhecke (managers), Luuc Eisenga (spokesperson) and Brian Holm, Valerio Piva (sports directors).

==History==

===Team beginnings: 1988–1991===
At the end of 1988, former World Champion Hennie Kuiper set up a German cycling team that was sponsored by the city of Stuttgart and rode on Eddy Merckx Cycles. The team was called &quot;Stuttgart-Merckx-Gonsor&quot; for the 1989 season and had nine riders (which included Udo Bölts). At that time when there were no German cycling teams and the country&#x27;s main cycling event, the Rund um den Henninger Turm had not been won by a German since Rudi Altig in 1970. During its first year of existence team rider Dariusc Kajzer brought the team its first success in the National Road Race Championships in Germany. The team became &quot;Stuttgart-Mercedes-Merckx-Puma&quot; in 1990 and Bölts continued the success of the team by becoming road race champion of Germany.

===Team Telekom: 1991–2004 ===
Deutsche Telekom came in as the main sponsor in 1991 and the team was known as &quot;Telekom-Mercedes-Merckx-Puma&quot;. According to an interview with Godefroot, it was Bölts’ 17th place at the 1991 Vuelta a España that prompted him to accept the Telekom management&#x27;s offer to take over the running of the team. Godefroot signed several riders including Classics specialist and 1991 Paris–Roubaix winner Marc Madiot. Bölts who was involved with the team since its beginnings in 1989 would stay with the team until 2003, continued building on the successes of the team by winning stage 19, the Queen stage of the 1992 Giro d&#x27;Italia. Jens Heppner continued this streak with his overall tenth place at the 1992 Tour de France.

The Telekom team signed all the promising cyclists that were coming from Germany at that time and who were becoming successful. These included Jens Heppner and Christian Henn in 1992, Erik Zabel, Rolf Aldag and Steffen Wesemann in 1993 and Jan Ullrich in 1994. Many of these riders would ride for more than ten years with the team. Olaf Ludwig also signed in 1993 and finished his career with the team. In 1994, Zabel won the first UCI Road World Cup victory in the history of the team, the Paris–Tours.

In 1993, the team again achieved success in the national championship road race in Germany. This was the start of the team&#x27;s 11 year domination and possession of the German champion&#x27;s jersey. Many of the successful team riders that spent many years of their career with Telekom would become German national champions – Bernd Gröne in 1993, Jens Heppner in 1994, Bölts in 1990, 1995 and 1999, Christian Henn in 1996, Jan Ullrich in 1997 and 2001, Erik Zabel in 1998 and 2003, Rolf Aldag in 2000, Danilo Hondo in 2002 and finally Andreas Klöden in 2004.

The team soon became an important presence on the international cycling stage. However the team was not invited to the 1995 Tour de France. Eventually the organisers of the Tour agreed that six Telekom members, namely Rolf Aldag, Udo Bölts, Jens Heppner, Vladimir Pulnikov, Erik Zabel and Olaf Ludwig would join with three members of the ZG Mobili to form a composite team. Zabel went on to win two stages in the race.

The next two years saw the international breakthrough of the team. Godefroot brought in the Danish rider, Bjarne Riis, the third-place finisher of the 1995 Tour and he went on to win the 1996 Tour de France, with the then 22-year-old German support rider Jan Ullrich finishing in second place. In addition, Zabel won the first of six green jerseys for winning the points competition. Bolts won the Clásica de San Sebastián and Wesemann won his second and the first of four wins with the Telekom team of the Peace Race.

The 1997 Tour de France saw the emergence of Ullrich as he won the race with support from Riis, who in turn had won the World Cup race, Amstel Gold Race earlier in 1997. Team Telekom also won the team classification, as the overall strongest team of the 1997 Tour. In addition, Bolts won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, Zabel won Milan–San Remo for the first of four times with the team. Ullrich also won the Championships of Hamburg semi-classic. The following year this race was elevated to the status of World Cup. In addition the Deutschland Tour returned in 1999 – evidence of the continuing popularity of cycling in Germany at the time. While Ullrich had a crash in the race and was forced to retire, Team Telekom did win the first edition of the race with Heppner and would win the race again with Alexander Vinokourov in 2001.

Ullrich finished second in the 1998 Tour de France but went on to win the 1999 Vuelta a España, although he missed the 1999 Tour de France due to a knee injury. After winning the Vuelta, Ullrich became World time trial champion which enabled him to wear the rainbow jersey during time trials. He would win this again in 2001. The next year, Zabel won the overall World Cup victory, having won the Milan–San Remo and Amstel Gold Race, while Ullrich was placed second again in the 2000 Tour de France to Lance Armstrong. Ullrich won the gold medal in the Olympic road race and the silver medal in the Olympic time trial. In 2001, Zabel won Milan–San Remo for the fourth time. Ullrich came in second in the 2001 Tour de France, while Zabel won six stages combined in the 2001 Tour and Vuelta. Kazakh rider Alexander Vinokourov won the Paris–Nice stage race in 2002, a feat he would duplicate in 2003, also winning the Amstel Gold Race and Tour de Suisse that year. As Ullrich left the team to form Team Bianchi in 2003, Vinokourov became team leader for the 2003 Tour de France. He finished in third place, just below the second placed Ullrich. Zabel won the 2003 Paris–Tours, while Italian rider Daniele Nardello took the Züri-Metzgete.

The team had a continuous presence at the top of the professional peloton and continued to sign the emerging German cyclists of the times including Andreas Klöden in 1998, Jörg Jaksche in 1999, Matthias Kessler in 2000 and Stefan Schumacher in 2002. In addition, the team also signed many successful non-German riders such as Georg Totschnig, Alexander Vinokourov, Cadel Evans, Santiago Botero and Paolo Savoldelli.

In 2005 a film titled &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; was released. It is a record of the 100th anniversary (but only the 90th running because of World War I and World War II) of the 2003 Tour de France in from the perspective of the then-Team Telekom.

===T-Mobile: 2004 – November 2007===

From 2004, the team changed its name to T-Mobile. Jan Ullrich returned to the team. The team achieved a great number of success, among which was Steffen Wesemann&#x27;s win in the Tour of Flanders. Coming up to the 2004 Tour de France, Kloden became German road race champion and Ullrich won the Tour de Suisse and raced the 2004 Tour de France as team leader, while Vinokourov did not ride the Tour de France for the team. Jan Ullrich finished fourth, while Andreas Klöden was the best placed rider of the team in second place. T-Mobile Team won the team classification, as the overall strongest team of the 2004 Tour. In the spring season of 2005, Vinokourov won the Liège–Bastogne–Liège classic race. Ullrich, as the team leader, finished 3rd overall in the 2005 Tour de France. Alexander Vinokourov rode in support, and finished fifth as he won two stages, including the final stage on the Champs-Élysées. Italian rider Giuseppe Guerini also won a stage and T-Mobile Team matched their 2004 feat by once again winning the team classification in 2005. Zabel won the Paris–Tours for the third time at the end of the season.

In July 2005, during the 2005 Tour, Vinokourov&#x27;s contract was running out and speculation was abundant if he was to stay with T-Mobile. With four days left of the 2005 Tour, he made an announcement that he would leave the team to pursue his own chances of winning the Tour de France as a team captain and after the Tour he joined the Liberty Seguros team. After 13 years with Team Telekom and T-Mobile Team, Erik Zabel also left in 2005 to ride for the newly formed Team Milram. Before the 2006 season, Walter Godefroot stepped down and Olaf Ludwig became the new T-Mobile team manager.

===Doping scandals: 2006–2007 ===
In the most controversial scandal since the 1998 tour, thirteen riders were expelled from the 2006 Tour de France stemming from a Spanish doping scandal, on the eve of Strasbourg prologue to the 93rd edition. Jan Ullrich, one of the favorites to win the race, was among those excluded from the Tour. Another T-Mobile rider, Óscar Sevilla, was also expelled, leaving the team starting with only seven riders.

On July 9, the team announced the dismissal of its sporting director, Rudy Pevenage, for his implication with former Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich in a Spanish blood doping scandal. &quot;The contract linking T-Mobile to Pevenage has been retrospectively stopped on June 30&quot;, the team&#x27;s general manager, Olaf Ludwig, said.

On July 21, 2006, T-Mobile fired Jan Ullrich from the team pending the doping investigation.
At the 2006 Tour de France, T-Mobile won the team classification for the third consecutive year, Andreas Klöden reached the podium (3rd place) for the second time, Matthias Kessler won Stage 3, Serhiy Honchar won two individual time trials (Stages 7 and 19) and wore the yellow jersey for 3 days (after Stages 7–9).

After the Tour de France, the team changed significantly; team manager, Olaf Ludwig left the team and was replaced by Bob Stapleton. Rolf Aldag, Allan Peiper and Tristan Hoffman became &quot;directeur sportifs&quot;. As already discussed Ullrich, Sevilla and Pevenage were dismissed from the team. Several riders who had been with the team for a long time such as Steffen Wesemann, Andreas Klöden and Matthias Kessler left. However, the reason is unclear. Jörg Ludewig was put on suspension and his contract was not increased in connection with intention to dope previously in his career and before he joined T-Mobile. Eddy Mazzoleni who was in his first year for the team also left. The contracts of Bram Schmitz and Bas Giling were not renewed. Dr. Lothar Heinrich, the team doctor since 1995, and Dr. Andreas Schmid set up a new comprehensive testing system. Following the revelations that came out of the Operación Puerto investigation, Heinrich allegedly nearly quit the sport but instead he joined with Stapleton and other team staff to create a new system of internal controls and health checks that he insisted would demonstrate that T-Mobile riders were clean and to restore credibility to the sport.

In May 2007, several former riders admitted to using banned substances (including EPO) while riding for the team in the mid-1990s, including Erik Zabel, Rolf Aldag, Brian Holm, Bjarne Riis, Bert Dietz, Udo Bölts and Christian Henn including the seasons in which Riis and Ullrich won the Tour de France. Team doctors Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich also confessed to participating and administering banned substances. The latter was Team Telekom&#x27;s sporting director until May 3, 2007, when he was suspended following allegations published in former team member Jef d&#x27;Hont&#x27;s book. Jef d&#x27;Hont had worked as a massage therapist for Team Telekom in 1992–96, and revealed in his book how the doping system had been organized at the team, throughout those years.

In an effort to present a renewed image the team brought a young team to the 2007 Tour de France, and promoted a drug-free attitude and image. Despite this, team member Patrik Sinkewitz tested positive for elevated testosterone during a training camp. The test results were only announced when Sinkewitz had dropped out of the Tour because of injury. He was still in hospital when he was suspended from Team T-Mobile, and was dismissed on July 31, 2007.

=== Team High Road: November 2007 – June 2008 ===

In November 2007, Deutsche Telekom AG announced that it was to end sponsorship of professional cycling with immediate effect. The team continued under the name &quot;Team High Road&quot; through June 2008. The team changed nationality in February 2008, switching from Germany to the United States.
The team continued due to the funding from the team owner, Bob Stapleton, as the team did not have enough time to gather sponsors for the new year. The team had a successful start to the year with Luxembourg rider, Kim Kirchen winning the classic La Flèche Wallonne. Results like this and also High-Road&#x27;s performance at the Giro d&#x27;Italia helped the team secure a sponsor for the end of the year.

=== Team Columbia and Team Columbia–High Road: July 2008 – June 2009 ===
On June 15, 2008 Columbia Sportswear announced a three-year sponsorship of the team beginning on July 5, the start of the Tour de France, changing the name to &quot;Team Columbia&quot;. The sponsorship included both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. The team went on to have a highly successful Tour, winning 5 stages (four of which went to British sprinter Mark Cavendish) and team leader Kim Kirchen lead the overall classification for four days and the points competition for three.

=== Team Columbia–HTC: June 2009 – January 2010 and Team HTC–Columbia: January 2010 – 2011===
On June 29, 2009 HTC announced a three-year sponsorship of the team beginning with the 2009 Tour de France. The team&#x27;s new name was &quot;Team Columbia–HTC.&quot; Like the Columbia Sportswear sponsorship, the HTC sponsorship included both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. The team enjoyed great success at the 2009 Tour de France with Mark Cavendish winning 6 stages over the course of the 3 weeks. The most memorable of these was his victory on the Champs-Élysées in Paris where he won by a huge margin; almost 30m, with his own lead out man, Mark Renshaw having enough time to come in 2nd with his arms raised. A documentary film called &quot;Chasing Legends&quot; was later released that covered the 2009 tour through the eyes of HTC–Columbia.

August proved a very good month for Norwegian all-rounder Edvald Boasson Hagen, with two stage wins and a podium finish in the Tour of Poland and two more stage wins and the GC win in the Eneco Tour. After stage wins in the other two Grand Tours of 2009, it took the team only three days to win yet another in the Vuelta, where Gregory Henderson took home the flowers.

Despite its many successes, Team Columbia did not seem to be able to afford as many top riders as they had, and due to their many victories, a lot of riders were targeted by other teams for the 2010 season. Notable riders such as Kim Kirchen, Edvald Boasson Hagen, Michael Barry, George Hincapie and Thomas Lövkvist elected to leave the team. As replacements, a lot of young talented riders, such as Jan Ghyselinck, Rasmus Guldhammer and Martin and Peter Velits were contracted.

On October 17, 2010, Team Columbia HTC announced a tie up with Specialized for 2011. Specialized would supply the team&#x27;s frames, forks, and helmets. The men would race the S-Works Tarmac for most road races, the S-Works Roubaix for cobbled classics, and the Shiv TT in time trials. The all-new S-Works Prevail and TT3 helmets would protect the riders in road and TT applications, respectively.

On August 4, 2011, General Manager, Bob Stapleton announced that Team HTC–Highroad were to fold at the end of the 2011 season after failing to find a new sponsor.

The team&#x27;s final event was the Chrono des Nations, in October 2011. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams both finished with victories, Tony Martin winning the men&#x27;s 48 km time trial, while Amber Neben won the women&#x27;s 20 km event. This gave the team 121 victories in its final year.

HTC–Highroad was voted 2011 Team of the Year by Cyclingnews.com, and won the Best Team and Best Women&#x27;s Team awards at the Velonews awards for 2011.

<text>Azapirones are a class of drugs used as anxiolytics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. They are commonly used as add-ons to other antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

== List of azapirones ==

The azapirones include the following agents:
; Anxiolytics
* Alnespirone (S-20,499)
* Binospirone (MDL-73,005)
* BMY-7,378 (CAS number: )
* Buspirone (Buspar)
* Enilospirone (CERM-3,726)
* Eptapirone (F-11,440)
* Gepirone (Exxua)
* Ipsapirone (TVX-Q-7,821)
* MJ-7378 (CAS number: )
* Revospirone (BAY-VQ-7,813)
* Tandospirone (Sediel)
* Zalospirone (WY-47,846)
; Antipsychotics
* Perospirone (Lullan)
* Tiospirone (BMY-13,859)
* Umespirone (KC-9,172)
; others
*SNAP-8719 (CAS number: )
*CID:14086451
==Medical uses==
Azapirones have shown benefit in general anxiety and augmenting SSRIs in social anxiety and depression. Evidence is not clear for panic disorder and functional gastrointestinal disorders.

Tandospirone has also been used to augment antipsychotics in Japan as it improves cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Buspirone is being investigated for this purpose as well.

== Side effects ==
Side effects of azapirones may include dizziness, headaches, restlessness, nausea, and diarrhea.

Azapirones have more tolerable adverse effects than many other available anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines or SSRIs. Unlike benzodiazepines, azapirones lack abuse potential and are not addictive, do not cause cognitive/memory impairment or sedation, and do not appear to induce appreciable tolerance or physical dependence. However, azapirones are considered less effective with slow onset in controlling symptoms.

== Chemistry ==

Buspirone was originally classified as an azaspirodecanedione, shortened to azapirone or azaspirone due to the fact that its chemical structure contained this moiety, and other drugs with similar structures were labeled as such as well. However, despite all being called azapirones, not all of them actually contain the azapirodecanedione component, and most in fact do not or contain a variation of it. Additionally, many azapirones are also pyrimidinylpiperazines, though again this does not apply to them all.

Drugs classed as azapirones can be identified by their -&quot;spirone&quot; or -&quot;pirone&quot; suffix.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===

On a pharmacological level, azapirones varyingly possess activity at the following receptors:

* 5-HT1A receptor (as partial or full agonists)
* 5-HT2A receptor (as inverse agonists)
* D2 receptor (as antagonists or partial agonists)
* α1-adrenergic receptor (as antagonists)
* α2-adrenergic receptor (as antagonists)

Actions at D4, 5-HT2C, 5-HT7, and sigma receptors have also been shown for some azapirones.

While some of the listed properties such as 5-HT2A and D2 blockade may be useful in certain indications such as in the treatment of schizophrenia (as with perospirone and tiospirone), all of them except 5-HT1A agonism are generally undesirable in anxiolytics and only contribute to side effects. As a result, further development has commenced to bring more selective of anxiolytic agents to the market. An example of this initiative is gepirone, which was recently approved after completing clinical trials in the United States for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Another example is tandospirone which has been licensed in Japan for the treatment of anxiety and as an augmentation to antidepressants for depression.

5-HT1A receptor partial agonists have demonstrated efficacy against depression in rodent studies and human clinical trials. Unfortunately, however, their efficacy is limited and they are only relatively mild antidepressants. Instead of being used as monotherapy treatments, they are more commonly employed as augmentations to serotonergic antidepressants like the SSRIs. It has been proposed that high intrinsic activity at 5-HT1A postsynaptic receptors is necessary for maximal therapeutic benefits to come to prominence, and as a result, investigation has commenced in azapirones which act as 5-HT1A receptor full agonists such as alnespirone and eptapirone. Indeed, in preclinical studies, eptapirone produces robust antidepressant effects which surpass those of even high doses of imipramine and paroxetine.

====Comparison of binding profiles====
=== Pharmacokinetics ===

Azapirones are poorly but nonetheless appreciably absorbed and have a rapid onset of action, but have only very short half-lives ranging from 1–3 hours. As a result, they must be administered 2–3 times a day. The only exception to this rule is umespirone, which has a very long duration with a single dose lasting as long as 23 hours. Unfortunately, umespirone has not been commercialized. Although never commercially produced, Bristol-Myers Squibb applied for a patent on October 28, 1993, and received the patent on July 11, 1995, for an extended release formulation of buspirone. An extended release formulation of gepirone is currently under development and if approved, should help to improve this issue.

Metabolism of azapirones occurs in the liver and they are excreted in urine and feces. A common metabolite of several azapirones including buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, revospirone, and tandospirone is 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP). 1-PP possesses 5-HT1A partial agonist and α2-adrenergic antagonist actions and likely contributes overall mostly to side effects.

<text>Blacktoft Sands RSPB reserve is a nature reserve in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which leases the site from Associated British Ports.

==Description==
The site is on the southern bank of the Ouse, west of its confluence with the River Trent, opposite the village of Blacktoft, and is a wetland. Being at the beginning of the Humber Estuary, the water is slightly saline. The reserve&#x27;s tidal reedbed is the largest in England. It is managed using a mixture of grazing with our six konik horses, reed cutting and maintaining and excavation of pools within the reedbed.

==Wildlife==
As an RSPB reserve Blacktoft Sands is known for its birdlife. The headline species are wetland birds which are rare in Britain. Breeding birds include Western marsh harrier, great bittern and bearded reedling which are reedbed specialists, while the pied avocet prefers the saline lagoons. Hen harrier is a notable wintering species, joining the previously mentioned species, along with merlin, peregrine falcon and barn owl. Large numbers of Eurasian teal and Eurasian wigeon also winter. The great bitterns first bred in 2000 and the pied avocets in 1992 and the Humber is now home to nationally important populations of these species. The Humber Estuary overall is important for breeding and wintering waders and wildfowl. The site is also important for passage birds such as Eurasian spoonbill, spotted redshank and ruff.

The lagoons are home to some rare specialist invertebrates including the amphipods &quot;Gammarus insensibilis&quot; and &quot;Gammarus chevreuxi&quot;, as well as the chironomid &quot;Glyptotendipes barbipes&quot;.

<text>Churchdown is a large village in Gloucestershire, England, situated between Gloucester and Cheltenham in the south of the Tewkesbury Borough.

The village has two centres. The older (Brookfield or &quot;village&quot;) centre is in Church Road near St Andrew&#x27;s Church; the more modern centre is in St John&#x27;s Avenue near St John&#x27;s Church. Churchdown is a relatively large village, with a population of 11,261 (2001), reducing to 10,990 at the 2011 census.
The village has a size of approximately 16.5 km2 (exactly 4,076 acres). Accordingly, the population density is 666 persons/km2.

== Location ==
Churchdown is located in a semi-rural environment; so close to Gloucester and Cheltenham, but surrounded on three sides by open countryside. Churchdown borders Imjin Barracks and the district of Innsworth to the North West.

=== Churchdown Hill ===

A local landmark is Churchdown Hill (also known locally as &quot;Chosen Hill&quot;), which rises to 155 metres (510 ft) above sea level and has views across the Severn Vale and to the Cotswolds, Gloucester, Cheltenham, the Malvern Hills, and into Worcestershire.

The hill is home to the historic sites of Mussell Well, the &quot;Roman&quot; Steps, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, also an analogue and now a DAB radio transmitter broadcasting BBC Radio Gloucestershire and two reservoirs operated by Severn Trent Water.

Churchdown Hill is supported by a local group called &quot;The Friends of Churchdown Hill&quot;. The &quot;Friends&quot; were active in the establishment of the Woodland Trust&#x27;s Churchdown Hill Nature Reserves and have published a walking guide and map to the hill.

====Nature reserves====
Parts of Churchdown Hill are managed by the Woodland Trust and are open freely to the public.

=== Administrative ===
Churchdown is within the parliamentary constituency of North Cotswolds. At a local government level, Churchdown is represented as two wards - Churchdown Brookfield (the southern half of Churchdown also known locally as &quot;Churchdown Village&quot;) and Churchdown St John&#x27;s (the northern half near St John&#x27;s church). The boundary between the two wards is the A40 Golden Valley Bypass road. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was in the South West Region for the European Parliament.

== Transport and travel ==
Churchdown has long benefited from a convenient location along routes between larger settlements. The Gloucester and Cheltenham Tramroad brought prosperity to the northern (St John&#x27;s) end of the village. This was succeeded by a road between Cheltenham and Gloucester along a similar route (called Cheltenham Road East as it traverses Churchdown), which was once part of the main trunk road from London to Fishguard. This road now provides access to Cheltenham and Gloucester, and also to the M5 via the &quot;Golden Valley Bypass&quot; section of the A40. There are some Segregated Bicycle Paths but there are sections which do not connect with each other and have poor design.

=== Rail ===
From 1874 until 1964 Churchdown was served by a Churchdown railway station on the main line between Birmingham and Bristol. There are some remains of the station itself next to what is now Station Close, but only through rail traffic continues today on the Cross Country Route for example.
=== Air ===
Churchdown is adjacent to Gloucestershire Airport, still known locally as &quot;Staverton&quot;. Light aircraft are a regular feature in the skies above the village, and occasionally military aircraft past and present. For the last ten years, the airport is regularly used as a helicopter training base for police and military purposes.

===Bus===
Local bus services are operated by Stagecoach West. Three services pass through Churchdown: The 94 between Cheltenham and Gloucester passes through on Cheltenham Road east, every 10 minutes. There are also the 97/98 routes, which also run between Cheltenham and Gloucester, but take a different, longer route between the two towns. In the village, the 97 runs via Parton Road and the 98 via Pirton Lane.

== Local information ==

===Magazines ===
Residents enjoy the Churchdown Magazine, which is produced bimonthly and is delivered free of charge to 5,100 households. It includes articles of local interest, advertisements and details of local events, and has been in print since 1974.

Since 2010, residents also receive MyChurchdown magazine, delivered free of charge and bi-monthly. This full colour glossy magazine is accompanied by a website and social media presence, sharing news, events, adverts, notices and articles and features of interest to local residents.

== Education ==
:&quot;See also List of schools in Gloucestershire&quot;
Churchdown has six schools, including two secondary schools - Churchdown School Academy and Chosen Hill School. There are also several primary schools; Churchdown Parton Manor Infant and Junior Schools, St Mary&#x27;s Catholic School and Churchdown Village Infant and Junior Schools.

== Sport and leisure ==
Churchdown has an eighteen-hole golf course and driving range on its outskirts at Brickhampton, and an inline and skateboard facility at Churchdown Park. 
Churchdown also boasts numerous football pitches and rugby pitches, as well as sports halls at both Churchdown and Chosen Hill schools.

Youth football is active through the Churchdown Panthers, who play mostly in the Cheltenham FA league.

The Chosen Hill Former Pupils rugby club first team plays in the South West League and has an active youth section.

Prior to the First World War, a golf course operated between the railway line and Churchdown Hill, with a club house adjacent on Pirton Lane. The area is now open farmland. The nine golf holes had names; The Gate, The Spinney, Spion Kop, The Crab, Khyrats Oak, Oystershells Green, The Saddle, Rabbits Hill and The Railway Home.
Also a bowling green which is part of the Churchdown Club.

== Churches ==
:&quot;See also List of churches in Gloucestershire&quot;

Churchdown has three Church of England Churches: St John&#x27;s, St Andrew&#x27;s and St Bartholomew&#x27;s. There is also the Catholic Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour on Cheltenham Road East, and Churchdown Methodist Church on Chapel Hay Lane. St Bartholomew&#x27;s is on the top of Churchdown Hill, built upon the site of a pre-Christian, Iron Age settlement.

== Historic buildings ==
Churchdown has several interesting old structures including the Old School House on The Green, where the first village school was held, Ye Old House on Sandfield Road (thought to have been built in the 16th century), Dunstan Cottage in Chapel Hay Lane and The Cottage on Oldbury Orchard.

On The Green stands a house where Beatrix Potter stayed, when she visited Gloucester in 1901, hence her famous story &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot;.

== Other information ==
The village has two main rows of shops and two pubs - the Hare and Hounds near St John&#x27;s, and the Old Elm near St Andrew&#x27;s. There is also a Social Club (Churchdown Club) located in Church Road where games of bowls skittles and tennis take place, and Churchdown Community Centre on Parton Road which houses Churchdown Social Club, and in which various functions are held and skittles on two alleys. The formerly thriving row of shops on St. John&#x27;s Avenue are known locally as &quot;The Avey&quot;. This road is also where the local GP practise used to be. There was also a branch of HSBC, a Co-operative shop and many years ago there was also a greengrocers called Tredgetts, where local children who attended Churchdown Parton Manor infants school would go to purchase their fruits for their breaktime snack.

Composer Herbert Howells dedicated his Piano Quartet &quot;to the hill at Chosen and Ivor Gurney who knows it&quot;, referring to Churchdown Hill. The hill was also the direct inspiration for his &#x27;Chosen Tune&#x27;, dedicated to his fiancee who lived at Churchdown.

It is often assumed that the boundary between Churchdown and Innsworth is at the &quot;Hare and Hounds&quot; public house at the Parton Road / Cheltenham Road (B 4063) junction. However, this is an incorrect assumption. Innsworth actually begins at the roundabout where Innsworth Lane and Highgrove Way branch off. I.e. H., all of the housing development south-west of Imjin Barracks and between Innsworth Lane and Cheltenham Road is still part of Churchdown.

<text>The least bittern (Botaurus exilis) is a small heron, the smallest member of the family Ardeidae found in the Americas. This species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The least bittern was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the herons, cranes, storks, and bitterns in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea exilis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;minute bittern&quot; from Jamaica that had been included by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham did not specify how he had obtained the specimen. The least bittern was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; but when a molecular phylogenetic study of the heron family Ardeidae published in 2023 found that &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was paraphyletic, &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was merged into the genus &quot;Botaurus&quot; that had been introduced in 1819 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens.. The genus name &quot;Botaurus&quot; is Medieval Latin for a bittern. The specific epithet &quot;exilis&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;little&quot; or &quot;slender&quot;.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;B. e. exilis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Breeding: east Canada and east, southwest USA. Non-breeding: Central America and West Indies
* &quot;B. e. pullus&quot; (Van Rossem, 1930) – northwest Mexico
* &quot;B. e. erythromelas&quot; (Vieillot, 1817) – east Panama and north South America to north Bolivia and north Argentina
* &quot;B. e. limoncochae&quot; (Norton, DW, 1965) – east Ecuador
* &quot;B. e. bogotensis&quot; (Chapman, 1914) – central Colombia
* &quot;B. e. peruvianus&quot; (Bond, J, 1955) – west central Peru

North American birds were formerly divided into two subspecies, eastern (&quot;B. e. exilis&quot;) and western (&quot;B. e. hesperis&quot;), but this is no longer believed to be a valid distinction.

The least bittern forms a superspecies with the little bittern and yellow bittern.

===Cory&#x27;s least bittern===
A dark rufous morph, &quot;B. e. neoxenus&quot;, termed &quot;Cory&#x27;s bittern&quot; or &quot;Cory&#x27;s least bittern&quot; was originally described by Charles Cory as a separate species in 1885 from a specimen collected on or near the Caloosahatchee River, near Lake Okeechobee, in southwest Florida. Cory stated that the specimen was &quot;without doubt perfectly distinct from any other known species&quot;. Further specimens followed over the next decades from Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Ontario.

Initially, Cory&#x27;s least bittern was accepted as a valid species, with Elliott Coues and Richard Bowdler Sharpe both including it in published species lists. As early as 1892, however, doubts were raised about the validity of Cory&#x27;s least bittern as a separate species. Nonetheless, in 1896 Frank Chapman wrote a detailed paper supporting its retention as a valid species. Outram Bangs later argued, in 1915, that this view was wrong and proposed that Cory&#x27;s should become a junior synonym of least bittern. This view eventually prevailed, with the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union removing the species from their list of North American birds in 1923, although others held dissenting views until at least 1928.

Cory&#x27;s least bittern was once fairly common, but it is now exceptionally rare, with only five sightings since 1950. More than 50% of the historical records are from the Toronto region of Ontario. Initially known only from the North American subspecies &quot;exilis&quot;, it was first recorded in the South America subspecies &quot;erthyromelas&quot; in 1967.

==Description==

The least bittern is one of the smallest herons in the world, with perhaps only the dwarf bittern and the black-backed bittern averaging smaller in length. It can measure from in length, and the wingspan ranges from . Body mass is from , with most least bitterns weighing between , making this perhaps the lightest of all herons. A recent manual of avian body masses cites another species in this genus, the stripe-backed bittern, as having a mean body mass slightly lower than the least bittern, which is credited with a mean mass of .

The bird&#x27;s underparts and throat are white with light brown streaks. Its face and the sides of the neck are light brown; it has yellow eyes and a yellow bill. The adult male is glossy greenish-black on the back and crown; the adult female is glossy brown on these parts; both have white lines on their shoulders. They show light brown parts (covert feathers) on the wings in flight.

These birds make cooing and clucking sounds, usually in the early morning or near dusk.

==Behaviour==

The least bittern is an elusive bird. They spend much time straddling reeds. When alarmed, the least bittern freezes in place with its bill pointing up, turns its front and both eyes toward the source of alarm, and sometimes sways to resemble wind-blown marsh vegetation. This is perhaps a predator-avoidance behaviour, since its small size makes the bittern vulnerable to many potential predators. Thanks to its habit of perching among the reeds, the least bittern can feed from the surface of water that would be too deep for the wading strategy of other herons. The least bittern and much larger and different-looking American bittern often occupy the same wetlands but may have relatively little interaction because of differences in foraging habits, preferred prey, and timing of breeding cycles. The least bittern arrives on its breeding grounds about a month after the American bittern and leaves one or two months earlier. John James Audubon noted that a young captive least bittern was able to walk with ease between two books standing apart. When dead, the bird&#x27;s body measured across, indicating that it could compress its breadth to an extraordinary degree.

===Breeding===
These birds nest in large marshes with dense vegetation from southern Canada to northern Argentina. Nest of strips of rushes woven together to form a platform and fastened to saw grass growing on the bank of a stream. The nest is a well-concealed platform built from cattails and other marsh vegetation. The female lays four or five eggs, in extreme cases from two to seven. The eggs are pale blue or green. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating food. A second brood is often produced in a season.

These birds migrate from the northern parts of their range in winter to the southernmost coasts of the United States and areas further south, travelling at night.

===Food and feeding===
They mainly eat fish, frogs, crustaceans, insects and small mammals, which they capture with quick jabs of their bill while climbing through marsh plants.

==Status==
The numbers of these birds have declined in some areas due to loss of habitat. They are still fairly common but are more often heard than seen. As the species has a large range and a large total population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot;. The least bittern is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

<text>The Leshan Giant Buddha () is a tall stone statue, built between 713 and 803 (during the Tang dynasty). It is carved out of a cliff face of Cretaceous red bed sandstones that lies at the confluence of the Min River and Dadu River in the southern part of Sichuan Province in China, near the city of Leshan. The stone sculpture faces Mount Emei, with the rivers flowing below its feet. It is the largest and tallest stone Buddha statue in the world and it is by far the tallest pre-modern statue in the world. It is over from the Wuyou Temple.

The Mount Emei Scenic Area, including Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area, has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996.

==Location==
The Leshan Giant Buddha is located at Lingyun Mountain’s Qifeng Peak. Qifeng Peak is located at the junction of the Minjiang River, Qingyi River, and Dadu River.

Other than the Leshan Giant Buddha, the Danxia Landform also contains abundant history and cultural connotations, such as cliff tombs and cliff dwellings. The Mahao Cliff Tombs at the Leshan Giant Buddha scenic area were built in the Han dynasty, indicating ancient residents&#x27; living habits.

==History==

Construction started in 723 AD, led by a Chinese Buddhist monk named Hai Tong. He believed that Maitreya Buddha would calm the turbulent waters that constantly plagued the shipping vessels traveling down the river. When funding for the project was threatened, he is said to have gouged out his own eyes to show his piety and sincerity. After his death, however, the construction was delayed due to insufficient funding. The statue was only completed from the shoulders up at the time. Several years later, Hai Tong’s disciples continued work on the statue with financial support from a local official named Zhangchou Jianxiong. Hai Tong’s disciples continued the construction until the Knees, when construction was halted because Zhangchou JianXiang was called back to serve at the royal court in Chang’an. About 70 years later, Jiedushi Wei Gao continued to support and funded the project and the construction was finally completed by Hai Tong&#x27;s disciples in 803.

By the beginning of the Northern Song dynasty, the Leshan Giant Buddha had been damaged—the body was covered in moss, and the wooden pavilion had collapsed. During the reign of Song Renzong, the Giant Buddha was repaired once on a large scale and the wooden pavilion was rebuilt. Since then, the records of the destruction and reconstruction of the Buddha have been missing, and the original temple, Lingyun Temple, had been destroyed by war many times.

Apparently, the massive construction resulted in so much stone being removed from the cliff face and deposited into the river below that the currents were indeed altered by the statue, making the water safe for passing ships.

A sophisticated drainage system was incorporated into the Leshan Giant Buddha when it was built. It is still in working order. It includes drainage pipes carved into various places on the body, to carry away the water after the rains to reduce weathering.

When the Giant Buddha was carved, a huge thirteen-story wood structure (similar to the one at the Rongxian Giant Buddha) was built to shelter it from rain and sunshine. This structure was destroyed and sacked by the Mongols during the wars at the end of the Yuan dynasty. From then on, the stone statue was exposed to the elements.

==Degradation==
The Leshan Buddha has been affected by the pollution emanating from the unbridled development in the region. According to Xinhua news agency, the Leshan Giant Buddha and many Chinese natural and cultural heritage sites in the region have seen degradation from weathering, air pollution, and tourism. To address this issue, the government has promised restoration work. Furthermore, scientists have been investigating the interactions between the microbial community in the surrounding soil and above ground plants, and its effects on the sculpture. The body of The Giant Buddha of Leshan is covered today by different organisms lichen, ferns and other bryophytes, and various shrubs and gramineous plants. Current research hopes that greater understanding of plant- and microbe-induced weathering effects may aid in the preservation of The Giant Buddha of Leshan.

==Composition==
The entire art piece is built in stone, except for the ears that were designed in wood, covered with mud on the surface to make clay, and attached to the head.

==Dimensions==

At tall, the statue depicts a seated Buddha with his hands resting on his knees. His shoulders are wide and his smallest toenail is large enough to easily accommodate a seated person. There is a local saying: &quot;The mountain is a Buddha and the Buddha is a mountain&quot;. This is partially because the mountain range in which the Leshan Giant Buddha is located is thought to be shaped like a slumbering Buddha when seen from the river, with the Leshan Giant Buddha as its heart.

This statue, carved in the Lingyun Mountain, is the biggest and tallest stone Buddha statue in the world (only the modern Great Buddha of Thailand, made of concrete, is taller). Leshan Giant Buddha’s hair is composed of 1,021 spiraled curls embedded in his head that measures in height and in width. His ears, capable of holding two people inside, are long. He has long eyebrows, long fingers, wide shoulders, and a long nose. His mouth and each of his eyes have a width of . His instep that is around in width can hold about a hundred people and his smallest toenail can fit one seated person. This statue is ten stories high, which can be compared to the size of the Statue of Liberty if Buddha stood upright. Buddha’s body is placed in a symmetrical posture and the proportions of his various body parts are proportioned in accordance with the Buddharupa requirements of a statue. It has a calm form, which conforms to the Tang dynasty statues&#x27; style.

==Drainage system==
Behind the Buddha’s head and between his two ears, the Leshan Giant Buddha has a unique and advanced drainage system to preserve the statue from erosion. There are several hidden gutters and channels scattered in Buddha’s hair, collar, chest, and holes in the back of his ears and chest that have been carrying out the rainwater to keep the inner areas dry. This complex architectural system has been preventing the statue from eroding for the past 1,200 years.

==Protection==
After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the Leshan Giant Buddha was designated as a cultural relic and put under protection by the Sichuan Provincial People’s Committee in 1956. In 1996, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee included the Leshan Giant Buddha in the World Cultural and Natural Heritage List. In 1998, the Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area Management Committee was formally established. The management committee’s scope of control reached . In 2008, the Mount Emei - Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area Management Committee was formally established, with the main task of developing tourism resources for Mount Emei and the Leshan Giant Buddha. On 24 March 2002, the first phase of the Leshan Giant Buddha repair project by the World Bank officially started. The project included completely renovating the Buddha from chest up to the head and then strengthening the rock wall. On 23 June 2002, the second phase of the Leshan Giant Buddha Maintenance Project started. During this phase, the rocks at the Buddha’s feet were repaired and the eroded part of the rock below water level was repaired.

==Tourism==
Being one of the six world cultural heritage sites in the province of Sichuan, it receives a lot of tourist visits. From 2001 to 2003, it was ranked the second most popular attraction amongst the provincial heritage sites with 1.4 to 1.5 million visitors per year. In 2004, there was a breakthrough which led the numbers to drastically go up to 2.1 million visitors. From 2005 to 2007, it had around 2.3 to 2.8 million visitors per year, which was more than all the other sites. The influx of tourists has allowed the local economy to flourish from the various jobs and income provided. However, there is backlash as to how ethical the rise in tourism, can affect the quality of the statue. With that, the local government has set limits and guidelines to preserve the integrity of the statue. The Leshan Giant Buddha is most popular during Chinese New Year when tourists from all over the world come to pray for good luck.

The most convenient way to get to the Giant Buddha from Leshan Town is through the local bus 13. Upon arrival, it is necessary to purchase a ticket at the price of CNY 90 per person (including Wuyou Temple &amp; Mahao Cliff Tomb). The opening hours are 7:30am–6:30pm from April until October and 8:00am–5:30pm from October until March. The weekends and holidays are much busier compared to weekdays.

Apart from the main attraction, there are dozens of pathways throughout the mountain that can be explored by foot.
People come from all over the world to worship Maitreya. To get a closeup view, there is a pedestrian pathway that allows visitors to appreciate the changing view of Buddha’s body through multiple perspectives. It is important to note that the plank pathways there are steep and narrow. To get a more panoramic view of him, there are sightseeing boats available at the price of CNY 70 per person. Since these boats have a capacity of 35 passengers, there may be a waiting line.

<text>The title of Earl of Ulster has been created six times in the Peerage of Ireland  and twice in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Since 1928, the title has been held by the Duke of Gloucester and is used as a courtesy title by the Duke&#x27;s eldest son, currently Alexander Windsor, Earl of Ulster. The wife of the Earl of Ulster is known as the Countess of Ulster. Ulster, one of the four traditional provinces of Ireland, consists of nine counties: six of these make up Northern Ireland; the remainder are in the Republic of Ireland.

==History==

King Henry II of England granted three Palatinates or seigniories in Ireland to Norman nobles during the Norman invasion of Ireland, that are considered to be equivalents of either earldoms or lordships by modern historians. Richard de Clare, Count Striguil, a Norman-Welsh knight known as Strongbow, was created Earl of Leinster, and the Anglo-Norman Sir Hugh de Lacy was created Earl of Meath. In 1181, Sir John de Courcy was created Earl of Ulster by patent from King Henry II. De Courcy was later also created Lord of Connaught and quickly became a rival of the De Lacys. No record of his enrollment exists, but de Courcy enjoyed the grant of Ulster as an earldom, according to 19th-century analysis of deeds de Courcy executed that survived in patent rolls (the earliest of which dates to 1201).

Though Ulster covers one-sixth of Ireland, making it among the largest land grants in Ireland, De Courcy began aggressively seizing more land in Ireland without permission, drawing the ire of King John of England. Hugh de Lacy the younger, son of the Earl of Meath, accused de Courcy of neglecting to pay homage to King John. The king sent a letter to the feudal barons of Ulster — allies of de Courcy – informing them that if they did not convince their lord to pay proper homage, all their land would be seized. According to the &quot;Four Masters&quot;, in 1203, Hugh de Lacy the younger, along with a contingent of English soldiers from Meath, marched on Ulaid and expelled de Courcy. A bloody battle between the two sides ensued at a place called Dundaleathglass (possibly Down), but de Courcy escaped following the defeat. In 1204, the de Lacy forces drove de Courcy, &quot;the plunderer of churches and territories,&quot; into Tyrone, where he sought protection from the Clan Owen, but the English of Ulaid chased him as far as Carrickfergus, Antrim. On Good Friday 1204, de Courcy was praying at the Church of Downpatrick (from which he had expelled, in 1177, the Augustinian monks settled there by St Malachy in 1124, replacing them with Benedictine monks). According to the account of his capture, the unarmed de Courcy managed to take a weapon from de Lacy&#x27;s men and killed 13 of the men before he was finally subdued and sent to England where he was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Though he eventually returned to royal favour, de Courcy never returned to Ireland.

De Courcy&#x27;s lands and title were forfeited, and de Lacy was created the Earl of Ulster with the transfer of de Courcy&#x27;s rights. The creation specifically granted Hugh de Lacy the right to everything John de Courcy possessed on the day of the battle, with the exception of the churches, which remained with the Crown:

&quot;The King to Meyler Fitz Henry, &amp;c. and the Barons of Ireland, &amp;c.

Know ye, that we have given and granted to Hugh de Lascy, for his homage and service, the land of Ulster, with the appurtenances, to have and to hold as John de Curcy held the same the day on which the same Hugh overcame him in the field, or on the day preceding: SAVING however to us the crosses of the same land. And know ye, that we do retain with us the aforesaid Hugh, and are leading him with us in our service; and therefore to you we command that his land and all his you preserve, maintain and defend as our demesne. Witness myself, at Windsor, the 2nd day of May.&quot; — &quot;Rotuli Litterarum Patentium in Turri Londinensi asservati 6 John&quot;

An additional grant the following year confirmed granted to him the &quot;whole land of Ulster&quot; &quot;et hæredibus suis&quot; (with remainder to his heirs). He died in 1243, leaving only one legitimate daughter, Lady Maud de Lacy. Upon her marriage to Walter de Burgh, Lord of Connaught in 1264, de Burgh was created Earl of Ulster in right of his wife.

The Burgh coat of arms (&quot;or a cross gules&quot;) was adopted as the flag of Ulster, though the title passed through the female line out of the family and eventually merged with the Crown. After the third earl was murdered at age 20 (leading to the Burke Civil War), he left only a daughter, Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster. She married Lionel of Antwerp, second surviving son of King Edward III, who held the title &quot;jure uxoris&quot;. Their only child Philippa became Countess of Ulster &quot;suo jure&quot; while her husband, Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, held the title &quot;jure uxoris&quot;.

After the death of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March and 7th Earl of Ulster, the earldoms and estates were left to his nephew, Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, the son of Edmund&#x27;s elder sister Anne de Mortimer. Along with his land and titles, Richard also inherited Mortimer&#x27;s claim to the throne, which eventually led to the Wars of the Roses. After the Yorkist victory, Richard&#x27;s son Edward of York was crowned Edward IV in 4 March 1461, and the Earldom of Ulster merged with the Crown.

The title of Earl of Ulster has subsequently been recreated six times for members of the Royal Family. The current incarnation of the title dates to 31 March 1928, when Prince Henry, the third son of King George V and Queen Mary, was simultaneously created Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

<doc id="803002" wikidata="Q309993" url="?curid=803002" title="Chivu Stoica">
<text>Chivu Stoica (the family name being Chivu; 8 August 1908 – 18 February 1975) was a leading Romanian Communist politician, who served as 48th Prime Minister of Romania.

==Early life==
Stoica was born in Smeeni, Buzău County, the sixth child of a ploughman. At age 12, after 5 years of elementary school, he left home, and started working as an apprentice at Căile Ferate Române, the state railway corporation. In 1921, he moved to Bucharest, where he worked as a boilermaker at the Vulcan, Lemaître, and Malaxa companies. He joined the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ), serving as secretary for the Blue Sector of Bucharest until 1929. At the Malaxa works, he met Gheorghe Vasilichi, who recruited him into the Communist Party (PCR) in 1931.

==Career==

In spring 1931, Stoica started working for the Grivița Railway Yards, where he met Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Vasile Luca, and Constantin Doncea; together, they started organizing a strike. On 20 August 1934, he was sentenced to 15 years of prison for his role in the Grivița Strike of 1933. He spent time at the Aiud, Doftana, Târgu Ocna, Văcărești, and Caransebeș prisons. In 1935–1936 he was at Ocnele Mari Prison, together with Gheorghiu-Dej. In 1940, his sentence was reduced to 9 years of hard labor. Later, the War Council of the 1st Army Corps pardoned him, but he was interned in the Târgu Jiu camp. At the internment camp, he was close to Gheorghiu-Dej, who may have wanted Stoica to be his successor as General Secretary.
He was a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party from 1945 to 1975, and a member of the Politburo. He was Prime Minister of Romania between 1955 and 1961 and President of the State Council of Romania (de facto head of state) from 1965 until 1967.

<text>Earl of Birkenhead was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1922 for the noted lawyer and Conservative politician F. E. Smith, 1st Viscount Birkenhead. He was Solicitor-General in 1915, Attorney-General from 1915 to 1919, and Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1919 to 1922. Smith had already been created a Baronet in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1918, Baron Birkenhead, of Birkenhead in the County of Chester, in 1919, Viscount Birkenhead, of Birkenhead in the County of Chester, in 1921, and was made Viscount Furneaux, of Charlton in the County of Northampton, at the same time as he was given the earldom. The three peerages, along with the earldom, were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Viscount Furneaux was used as the courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom; the title was derived from the maiden name of Lord Birkenhead&#x27;s wife.

He was succeeded by his only son, the second Earl. He was also a Conservative politician and held minor office under Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill. However, Lord Birkenhead is best remembered as a biographer. He was succeeded by his only son, the third Earl. Like his father, he was a biographer. He never married and the titles became extinct on his early death in 1985. The second Earl&#x27;s daughter, Lady Juliet Townsend, was Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire.

Birkenhead was a member of the committee for the 1924 Olympic Games, and more than 50 years after his death he was portrayed by actor Nigel Davenport in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;.

<doc id="803012" wikidata="Q648570" url="?curid=803012" title="Milan Stojadinović">
<text>Milan Stojadinović (; 4 August 1888 – 26 October 1961) was a Serbian and Yugoslav politician and economist who was the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia from 1935 to 1939. He also was Foreign Minister from 1935 to 1939 and as Finance Minister three times (1922–1924, 1924–1926, 1934–1935).

==Early life==

Milan Stojadinović was born on 4 August 1888 in the Serbian town of Čačak. His father, Mihailo, was a municipal judge who relocated to Belgrade in 1904. It was here that the young Stojadinović finished his secondary education and became a sympathizer of the Serbian Social Democratic Party (SSDP). Later, he came to believe that the liberation of ethnic Serbs who lived in the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires was more important than bridging the gap between the upper and lower classes, and followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by joining the People&#x27;s Radical Party (NRS) of Nikola Pašić.

In the summer of 1906, Stojadinović was sent to Austria to learn German as a reward for successfully completing secondary school. While there, he fell under the influence of South Slavic youth movements and became a supporter of Yugoslav unity. He later returned to Serbia and began his studies at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law, specializing in economics and finance. He spent three years studying abroad, staying in Munich and Potsdam during the 1910–11 school year, Paris between 1911 and 1912, and London between 1912 and 1913. Stojadinović&#x27;s stay in Germany had a profound effect on his economic views and led him to write a doctoral dissertation on the country&#x27;s budget. He was greatly influenced by the German historical school of economics, which argued that economic policies should be developed according to the specific economic and cultural conditions prevalent in a society rather than being based on a universal model.

==Economist==

Stojadinović&#x27;s competence as an economist became evident during the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and during World War I, when he began working in the Serbian Ministry of Finance. Following the Serbian Army&#x27;s retreat through Albania during the winter of 1915, he withdrew with the Serbian government-in-exile to the Greek island of Corfu. He stayed there between 1916 and 1918 and distinguished himself as a financial expert by helping to stabilize the Serbian dinar.

Stojadinović met his future wife Augusta – a woman of mixed Greek-German heritage – during his stay in Corfu. The two settled in Belgrade following the war. Stojadinović was appointed assistant manager of a local branch of the English Commercial Bank in 1919, but resigned as director-general of the State Accounts Board of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes because of disagreements with the government of Prime Minister Ljubomir Davidović and his Democratic Party. He lectured economics at the University of Belgrade from 1920 to 1921, but quickly gave up on academia.

==Finance Minister==

Stojadinović became the Minister of Finance in 1922, aged only 34. He began writing for the Belgrade daily &quot;Politika&quot; and the English-language weekly &quot;The Economist&quot;. Following the proclamation of a royal dictatorship by King Alexander I in 1929, he sided with a faction of the NRS which stood opposed to the monarch being given dictatorial powers. The Radical Party broke into two in 1929, with the largest faction supporting King Alexander&#x27;s royal dictatorship and Stojadinović joining the opposition faction headed by the party&#x27;s Main Committee.

Despite being a suspected anti-monarchist by Yugoslav authorities, he was once again appointed to the position of Finance Minister in the government of Bogoljub Jevtić, who became prime minister following Alexander&#x27;s assassination in Marseille in October 1934. By this point, Stojadinović was the vice-president of the Belgrade Stock Exchange, chairman of a river navigation company, the director of a British-owned broadcasting station and a British-owned shipbuilding company. Despite the fact that it was clear that Italy and Hungary were behind the assassination of King Alexander, the fact that the League of Nations failed to take action against either of those countries, despite Yugoslavia presenting evidence of their involvement, served to convince Stojadinović that the League was useless.

==Prime minister==

In 1935, he became the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, which with some other parties formed a coalition &quot;Jugoslovenska Radikalna Zajednica&quot; (Yugoslav Radical Union, JRZ) and won the elections. The JRZ was made of the Serb Radicals, the Slovene People&#x27;s Party led by Father Anton Korošec and the Yugoslav Muslim Organization led by Mehmed Spaho, which Stojadinović called a &quot;three-legged chair&quot; that was missing a &quot;fourth leg&quot;, namely the support of the Croats. Stojadinović wrote in his memoirs: &quot;I called our party the three-legged chair, on which it was possible to sit when necessary, although a chair with four legs is far more stable&quot;. On 24 June 1935 he was elected prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He survived a failed assassination attempt by Damjan Arnautović, a school teacher, in 1935. The Regent for the boy king Peter II, the Prince Regent Paul, appointed Stojadinović Prime Minister partly because he was regarded as a financial expert who would deal with the effects of the Great Depression, and partly because Stojadinović was believed to be capable of making a deal with the Croat politicians to resolve the thorny question over whether Yugoslavia was to be a federation or a unitary state. One of Stojadinović&#x27;s first acts was to loosen censorship on the press and to free 10,000 political prisoners. Through the JRZ Stojadinović had a submissive &quot;skupshtina&quot; (parliament), but the JRZ never became the mass movement that Stojadinović had envisioned.

===Domestic issues===

The British historian Richard Crampton wrote that the basis of Stojadinović&#x27;s power rested on &quot;political jobbery&quot; and corruption as the JRZ functioned more as a patronage machine of a type very common to the Balkans rather than the fascistic mass movement that Stojadinović had intended. Interwar Yugoslavia was characterized by an etatist economic system with the state playing a very large role in the economy. The Yugoslav state owned all or most of the railroads, docks, mines, steel mills, forests, mills, hospitals, banks, publishing houses, hotels, theatres and opera houses in the country, together with the state having monopolies over the manufacturing, distribution and sales of matches, salt, cigarette paper, tobacco and kerosene. As the public sector jobs paid considerably better than the private sector, and there were more opportunities for corruption, there was much competition for jobs in the public sector, especially in a country as poor as Yugoslavia, meaning whatever government that was in power in Belgrade could build much support by operating a patronage machine which would hand out public sector jobs in exchange for votes. Every government in interwar Yugoslavia used the powers of patronage to reward its supporters with public sector jobs and punish its enemies by denying them the chance to work in the public sector. Stojadinović, like his predecessors, created a patronage machine as the basis of his power with JRZ members being rewarded with employment in the public sector. However, the gradual improvement of the Yugoslav economy in the late 1930s after the nadir it had fallen to in 1932, the worst year of the Great Depression, did win Stojadinović a measure of popularity. Stojadinović believed that the solution to the Great Depression were closer economic links with Germany, which lacked many of the raw materials necessary for a modern industrial economy and whose population exceeded the capacity of German farmers to feed it. As Germany needed both food and raw materials such as iron, bauxite, copper and manganese, Yugoslavia enjoyed an economic bloom from 1935, exporting minerals and agricultural products to Germany on an enormous scale, leading to an economic revival and placing Yugoslavia in the German economic sphere of influence.

The Prince regent had hoped that Stojadinović would make overtures to the Croats, but Stojadinović&#x27;s unwillingness to discuss federalisation of Yugoslavia presented major difficulties to this end. As part of an attempt to reach out to the Croats, Stojadinović signed a concordat with the Vatican in 1935. The purpose of the Concordat was to win Croat support for the JRZ as it agreed informally during the negotiations if the Concordat was passed, then the Roman Catholic Church would ensure its moral influence with Croat voters in favor of the JRZ, but opposition from the Serbian Orthodox Church caused Stojadinović to put off submitting the concordat for ratification. In another concession to the Croats, Stojadinović allowed a statue of the assassinated Croat politician Stjepan Radić to be erected in Zagreb and for Croats who went into exile under King Alexander to return, including the son-in-law of Radić who had once called for independence for Croatia. Though in theory a supporter of economic liberalism, in practice Stojadinović favored an etatist economic policy, arguing that the state should intervene to end the Great Depression.

===Diplomacy===

Stojadinović recognized the military threats from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and surrounding countries as imminent. Right from the beginning of his prime-ministership, Stojadinović had worked towards bringing Yugoslavia closer to Germany and away from its traditional ally, France. In late 1935, Stojadinović appointed a well known Germanophile as the Yugoslav minister in Berlin to replace the former minister who had a more critical attitude towards the &quot;Reich&quot;. Even before the remilitarization of the Rhineland, Yugoslavia under the leadership of Stojadinović was moving towards a pro-German foreign policy. In 1935, Yugoslavia observed the sanctions that the League of Nations had imposed on Italy, which inflicted harm on the Yugoslav economy, and Stojadinović signed his first economic treaty with Germany at the same time. In February 1936, Stojadinović welcomed King Boris III of Bulgaria to Belgrade, marking the beginning of Yugoslav-Bulgarian rapprochement as Stojadinović wanted more friendly relations with Sofia to settle the &quot;Macedonian Question&quot; which poisoned Yugoslav-Bulgarian relations in the interwar period.

Yugoslavia had signed a treaty of alliance with France in 1927, at a time when the Rhineland was still occupied by France, and during Franco-Yugoslav staff talks, it was promised that France would take the offensive into western Germany if Germany should start another war. As long as the Rhineland remained a demilitarized zone, there was always the possibility of the French launching an offensive into western Germany, which reassured Yugoslavia. Weinberg wrote that the demilitarized status of the Rhineland the treaty of Versailles had imposed was &quot;...the single most important guarantee of peace in Europe&quot; for as long as the Rhineland was demilitarized, it was impossible for Germany to attack any of France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe without exposing itself to the risk of a devastating French offensive into western Germany. The remilitarization of the Rhineland on 7 March 1936 meant that Germany started building the West Wall along its border with France, which ended any hope of a French offensive into western Germany. From the Yugoslav viewpoint, the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the construction of the West Wall meant that Germany could now launch offensives into eastern Europe without fear of France, which led Stojadinović to break with the traditional pro-French foreign policy of Yugoslavia and to seek an understanding with the &quot;Reich&quot;. On 15–20 June 1936, the chiefs of staff of the Little Entente (Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) met in Bucharest to discuss their plans now that the Rhineland was re-militarized. The gloomy conclusion of the Bucharest meeting was that France was not a factor in Eastern Europe, and henceforward there were only two great powers in Eastern Europe, namely the Soviet Union and Germany, and the victory of either in another war would mean the end of their independence. Stojadinović viewed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia&#x27;s future sustainable only if a neutral status akin to that of Switzerland could be established. His foreign policies pushed consistently towards this goal. Examples are the non-aggression treaty with Italy and Yugoslavia&#x27;s extension of its treaty of friendship with France.

The policies pursued by Fascist Italy towards Yugoslavia were usually hostile, but starting in 1936, Benito Mussolini made a major effort to try to persuade Yugoslavia to renounce its alliance with France. After the election of the Popular Front government of Léon Blum in France, Italian foreign policy had turned very anti-French, and Mussolini as part of his anti-French strategy wanted to detach Yugoslavia from the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; as Yugoslavia was the only one of France&#x27;s eastern European allies that had a common frontier with Italy. Besides for his anti-French goals, Mussolini had plans to annex Albania and to use it as a base to conquer Greece, which was allied to Yugoslavia in the Balkan Pact, making an alliance with Belgrade useful from his viewpoint. Mussolini had expected that the assassination of King Alexander in 1934, which he had financed, would cause a civil war between the different peoples of Yugoslavia, which in turn would allow the Italians to seize the parts of Yugoslavia that they had long coveted. The assassination of Alexander on 9 October 1934 while on a state visit to France did not cause the expected civil war, showing Mussolini that Yugoslavia was more stable than he thought, causing him to temporarily abandon his plans against that country, and instead work for a rapprochement with Belgrade, which Stojadinović welcomed. From 1936 onward, there were increasing signs that Italy and Germany were putting aside their differences caused by the &quot;Austrian Question&quot; to work together with Mussolini proclaiming in a speech in Milan in October 1936 that there was now a &quot;Berlin-Rome axis&quot; in Europe. The existence of the &quot;Berlin-Rome axis&quot; ended whatever hopes the Yugoslavs might have had of playing off Italy against Germany.

===Balkan relations===
In October 1936, Stojadinović visited Istanbul and while on his way back to Belgrade stayed at Kricim Castle, which was the rural residence of King Boris. During his stay at Kricim castle, Boris and Stojadinović agreed to sign a friendship treaty. Under the terms of the Balkan Pact, approval by the other members was required if any member wanted to sign a treaty with another Balkan state. Stojadinović faced little opposition from Turkey, but both Romania and Greece objected strenuously, believing that Yugoslavia was deserting the alliance, and only reluctantly gave permission in January 1937. Both Romania and Greece only gave their assent when Stojadinović threatened to sign the pact without their permission, which would have broken up the Balkan Pact. 

In late 1936, Stojadinović sabotaged a diplomatic effort on the part of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay to strengthen the Little Entente of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia by having the terms of the Little Entente apply against aggression by any state, instead of only Hungary. Both King Carol II of Romania and President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia supported the French proposal, and Stojadinović was the lone holdout who refused to discuss amending the treaty which created the Little Entente. When a French envoy arrived in Belgrade in an attempt to persuade Stojadinović to change his mind, he stated that Yugoslavia was now so deeply into Germany&#x27;s economic sphere of influence that he could simply not risk a war with the &quot;Reich&quot;, which had become Yugoslavia&#x27;s largest trading partner and investor by far. Yugoslavia was so deeply into the German economic sphere that it was considered unnecessary in Berlin to sign an alliance with Belgrade, as it was calculated that economic interests alone would ensure that Yugoslavia was a &quot;de facto&quot; German ally. By 1938, 60% of Yugoslavia&#x27;s trade was with Germany, making the &quot;Reich&quot; into Yugoslavia&#x27;s largest trading partner with Germany importing bauxite, copper, and manganese as part of its preparations for war while the majority of consumer goods and capital equipment in Yugoslavia were German imports.

On 24 January 1937, Stojadinović signed the friendship pact with Bulgaria. Although the pact was actually a banal document saying that the peoples of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria were henceforward to live together in peace and friendship, at the time of the signing Stojadinović and his Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Kyoseivanov verbally agreed that Bulgaria would cease making claims on Yugoslav Macedonia in exchange for which Stojadinović would support Bulgarian claims against Greece. Stojadinović wanted much of Greek Macedonia for Yugoslavia, especially the port city of Thessaloniki, and the purpose of the friendship pact was to lay the basis of a Yugoslav-Bulgarian alliance against Greece. At the time of the signing, Stojadinović and Kyoseivanov agreed that Alexandroupoli would go to Bulgaria while Yugoslavia would take Thessaloniki. As Bulgaria was an ally of Italy via Boris&#x27; marriage to Princess Giovanna, the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, improving relations with Sofia fitted in with Stojadinović&#x27;s plans to improve relations with Rome. Stojadinović intended to end the problem of Ustasha terrorism in Croatia by a rapprochement with Italy that would cause the Italians to cease supporting the Ustasha, which would help with his plans to settle the &quot;Croat question&quot;.

===Croatia===

In January 1937, Stojadinović met with Vladko Maček of the Croatian Peasant Party at a meeting chaired by Prince Paul. Stojadinović rejected Maček&#x27;s demands for a federation, and instead preferred that Maček establish ties with Serbian opposition leaders to divide Yugoslav politics into two blocs that would transcend ethnicity, language and religion. One bloc would be a federalist bloc and another bloc would be unitarist, which Stojadinović saw as the solution to Yugoslavia&#x27;s problems of unity as it would create pan-Yugoslav ties that would ultimately weaken the prevailing ties of language, ethnicity and religion. Stojadinović tried to make himself the &quot;national&quot; leader of the Serbs in a way comparable to how Maček was viewed as the &quot;national&quot; leader of the Croats, Father Korošec as the &quot;national&quot; leader of the Slovenes and Spaho as the &quot;national&quot; leader of the Bosnian Muslims, but the heterogeneous values of the Serb voters caused the failure of his bid to be the Serb &quot;national leader&quot;. The fact that the Serbs were the largest single ethnic group in Yugoslavia meant that Serb voters did not feel the need to rally around a single &quot;national&quot; leader in the same way the minorities – who felt that they could not afford disunity and tended to vote for one party – did.

===Negotiations with the Axis powers===
In March 1937, Stojadinović told Raymond Brugère, the French minister in Belgrade, that France was secure behind the Maginot Line, but the construction of the West Wall meant that the French Army would probably stay behind the Maginot Line if Germany should attack any of France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe, which led him to the conclusion that Yugoslavia must not &quot;provoke&quot; Germany in any possible way. Without informing France, Czechoslovakia or Romania, Stojadinović opened negotiations in the winter of 1936–37 for an Italo-Yugoslav treaty intended to resolve all of the outstanding problems between the two countries. On 25 March 1937, the Italian foreign minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, arrived in Belgrade to sign the treaty alongside Stojadinović. Under the terms of the Italo-Yugoslav treaty, Italy promised to rein in the Ustasha; respect the borders of Yugoslavia; and accept Yugoslavia&#x27;s membership in the Little Entente, the League of Nations and the Balkan pact in exchange for which Yugoslavia accepted Albania as being in the Italian sphere of influence. Although Stojadinović did not formally repudiate either alliance with France or the Little Entente, the Italo-Yugoslav treaty brought Yugoslavia much closer to the Axis powers and did much to weaken its existing alliances, and brought a definitive end to the French effort to strengthen the Little Entente. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg summarized the effects of the Italo-Yugoslav treaty: &quot;Having signed with Italy, he [Stojadinović] could hardly be expected to sign an agreement with France that was designed to protect Yugoslavia against her new associate. Conversely, he could not promise to assist Czechoslovakia against Germany, Italy&#x27;s Axis partner. Stojadinović could, therefore, now safely assure the Germans that there would be no Yugoslav assistance pact with France&quot;.

The attempted Concordat with the Holy See caused severe protests from the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1937 and thus never came into effect. When the Concordat came up for ratification by the &quot;skupshtina&quot; on the night of 23–24 June 1937, protests broke out in Belgrade by Orthodox priests who called the concordat a sell-out to the Roman Catholic Church. The very night that the parliament was holding the vote to ratify the Concordat, the Patriarch Varnava of the Serbian Orthodox Church died, which for the Orthodox faithful was a sign that God disapproved of the Concordat. The fact that the Patriarch died the same night caused an immense backlash against the Concordat among the Serbs, and the Orthodox Church announced that all Orthodox deputies in the &quot;skupshtina&quot; who voted for the Concordat were now penalised. Stojadinović withdrew the Concordat in a bid to save his popularity with the Serbs, which damaged his reputation as a fair-minded negotiator with the Croats, with Maček accusing him of dealing in bad faith. The consequence of the failed Concordat was that Stojadinović lost popular support in both Croatia and Serbia. In October 1937, Maček signed an accord called the Bloc of National Agreement which brought together his own Croatian Peasant Party with the anti-Stojadinović faction of the Serb Radicals, the Democrats, the Agrarian Party and the Independent Democrats. By this time, despite the economic upturn, Stojadinović was widely unpopular owing to the rampant corruption within his government. The British novelist Rebecca West who went to Yugoslavia in 1937 to research her book &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; reported that ordinary people had told her that Stojadinović was &quot;a tyrant and enemy of freedom&quot; who was &quot;hated throughout the length and breadth of the land&quot; as persistent rumors had it that Stojadinović and company were looting the public treasury. In December 1937, Stojadinović visited Rome to meet Benito Mussolini and his son-in-law, the Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, both of whom he regarded as friends. Ciano wrote in his diary that Stojadinović: &quot;...liked the Mussolini formula: strength and consensus. King Alexander had only strength. S[tojadinović] wants to popularize his dictatorship&quot;. Ciano reciprocated Stojadinović&#x27;s admiration of Fascist Italy, writing in his diary he is &quot;our sincere friend... a strong, full-blooded man with a resonant laugh and a strong handshake... a man who inspires confidence... Of all the political men I have encountered so far in my European wanderings, he is the one I find the most interesting&quot;. Although Stojadinović brought along his wife, Ciano arranged parties &quot;with the most beautiful women of Rome society&quot;, knowing that Stojadinović was a womanizer who took many of the Roman beauties he met to his bed.

Under the Little Entente of 1921, Yugoslavia was obligated to go to war if Hungary attacked either Czechoslovakia or Romania. In January 1938, Stojadinović visited Germany to meet Adolf Hitler and assured him that he was a personal admirer of &quot;der Führer&quot; who wanted much closer German-Yugoslav ties. Hitler for his part, assured Stojadinović that as long as he continued his pro-German policies that not only would Germany never attack Yugoslavia, but would also not support Hungary&#x27;s claims against Yugoslavia, which for Stojadinović validated his foreign policy. Stojadinović promised Hitler that Yugoslavia would accept any &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria as Yugoslavia regarded the question of annexing Austria as an &quot;internal&quot; German matter. Stojadinović stated that Yugoslavia had always enjoyed good relations with Germany except when it viewed the &quot;Reich&quot; through &quot;somebody&#x27;s else spectacles&quot; (a reference to France), leading Hitler to say that Germany no longer viewed Yugoslavia &quot;through Viennese spectacles&quot;. 

Stojadinović&#x27;s remarks during his visit to Berlin led to an explosive meeting with Raymond Brugère, the French minister upon his return to Belgrade. Brugère was a bumptious character who did not always follow the niceties of diplomacy. Brugère confronted Stojadinović, expressing his &quot;astonishment&quot; about his statements in Berlin, leading to charge that Stojadinović was abandoning Yugoslavia&#x27;s friends for its enemies. Stojadinović who did not want to end the alliance with France responded by saying maintaining the alliance with France remained a &quot;fundamental&quot; element of his foreign policy, leading Brugère to demand proof of such intentions. Brugère demanded that Yugoslav Army general hold staff talks with French Army general staff again, and have Yugoslavia to start buying French arms again, saying that as far as he concerned that Yugoslavia was a French ally in word, not deed.

In 1938, Germany was planning to attack Czechoslovakia and Mussolini, in a bid to assist Hitler, worked to detach Yugoslavia from the Little Entente. In June 1938, Stojadinović met with Count Ciano and promised him that Yugoslavia would do nothing if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia. In return, Stojadinović asked that the Italians use their influence with the Hungarians to keep Hungary from attacking Czechoslovakia, saying the Little Entente was directed against Hungary, and as long as Hungary remained neutral, so would Yugoslavia. After the Munich Agreement, Stojadinović appeared quite comfortable with the idea of Germany as the hegemonic power in Eastern Europe, and German-Yugoslav relations had improved so much that in late 1938, Stojadinović began talks about buying weapons from Germany for Yugoslavia. Stojadinović started to call himself , Serbo-Croatian for &quot;leader&quot;, but abandoned the title when he realized that when pronounced repeatedly in Serbo-Croatian, it sounds like the word (&quot;devil&quot;), which the Prime Minister&#x27;s opponents took advantage of by mocking the JRZ supporters for seemingly hailing the &quot;devil&quot;. Furthermore, Stojadinović calling himself &quot;the leader&quot; led the Prince Regent Paul to doubt his loyalty to King Peter II.

===Replacement===

A day before the elections on 11 December 1938, Stojadinović told a group of journalists at a press conference in Belgrade that the JRZ&#x27;s platform was: &quot;One King, one nation, one state, prosperity at home, peace on the borders&quot;. During the election, Stojadinović presented himself as a strongman with campaign pamphlets proclaiming the slogan &quot;one king, one nation, one state&quot; and featured photographs of Stojadinović giving speeches to his uniformed followers. In late 1938 he was re-elected, albeit with a smaller margin than expected, failed in pacifying the Croats, raised a military-like legion of his own followers (&#x27;Green Shirts&#x27;), and did not formulate any clear political programme, providing the regent Paul with a welcomed pretext upon which to replace Stojadinović, on 5 February 1939, with Dragiša Cvetković. Prince Paul had by early 1939 come to see the ambitious Stojadinović with his dreams of being a fascist leader, as a threat to his own power.

Following his replacement, the Prince Regent went further by detaining Stojadinović without proper cause until he had managed, with the help of his strong personal ties to King George VI of the UK (who had been the Prince Regent&#x27;s best man in 1923) to enlist the support of the United Kingdom to have Stojadinović sent into exile to the British Crown colony of Mauritius, where he was kept during World War II. On 17 March 1941, Stojadinović was handed over to a British Army force in Greece, from where he was sent on to Mauritius. By this point, Paul favored exile as he feared Stojadinović could be the focus of a pro-Axis coup directed from Berlin. Paul wanted to ensure that there was no alternative leadership in Belgrade for which the Axis powers could do a deal with. The British prime minister Winston Churchill justified interning Stojadinović in Mauritius as he was a &quot;potential Quisling and an enemy&quot;.

==Emigration==

In 1946, Stojadinović went to Rio de Janeiro, and then to Buenos Aires, where he was reunited with his wife and two daughters. Stojadinović spent the rest of his life as presidential advisor on economic and financial affairs to governments in Argentina and founded the financial newspaper &quot;El Economista&quot;. Stojadinović was close to the Argentine president Juan Perón to whom he was an economic adviser. The affluent lifestyle of Stojadinović in Buenos Aires suggested that the rumors of personal corruption on his part during his time as prime minister had some foundation in fact. In 1954, Stojadinović met with Ante Pavelić, the former &quot;Poglavnik&quot; of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) who also lived in Buenos Aires, and agreed to cooperate with him on the creation of two independent and enlarged Croatian and Serbian states. Since Pavelić&#x27;s regime during World War II had killed between 300,000 and 500,000 Serbs, Stojadinović&#x27;s willingness to work with Pavelić largely discredited him both in Yugoslavia and among the Serb diaspora overseas. The Ustasha campaign against the Serbs in World War II is viewed by the Serbs as well as scholars as an act of genocide, and the photographs of Stojadinović shaking hands with Pavelić finished off whatever was left of his good reputation. He died in 1961. Stojadinović&#x27;s memoirs, titled &quot;Neither War, Nor Pact&quot; (&quot;Ni rat, ni pakt&quot;), were posthumously published in Buenos Aires in 1963 and were re-printed in Rijeka in 1970.

<text>The history of Limerick stretches back to its establishment by Vikings as a walled city on King&#x27;s Island (an island in the River Shannon) in 812, and to the granting of Limerick&#x27;s city charter in 1197.

King John ordered the building (1200) of a great castle. The city was besieged three times in the 17th century, culminating in the famous 1691 Treaty of Limerick and the flight of the defeated Catholic leaders abroad. Much of the city was built during the following Georgian prosperity, which ended abruptly with the Act of Union in 1800. Today the city has a growing multicultural population.

==Name==
&quot;Luimneach&quot; originally referred to the general area along the banks of the Shannon Estuary, which was known as &quot;Loch Luimnigh&quot;. The original pre-Viking and Viking era settlement on Kings Island was known in the annals as &quot;Inis Sibhtonn&quot; and &quot;Inis an Ghaill Duibh&quot;

The name dates from at least 561, but its original meaning is unclear. Early anglicised spellings of the name are &quot;Limnigh, Limnagh, Lumnigh&quot; and &quot;Lumnagh&quot;, which are closer to the Irish spelling. There are numerous places of the same name throughout Ireland (anglicised as Luimnagh, Lumnagh, Limnagh etc.). According to P W Joyce in &quot;The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places II&quot;, the name &quot;signifies a bare or barren spot of land&quot;. Similarly, others have suggested that the name derives from &quot;loimeanach&quot; meaning &quot;a bare marsh&quot; or &quot;a spot made bare by feeding horses&quot;. The &quot;Dindsenchas (The Metrical Dindsenchas III page 274)&quot;, attempted to explain the name in a number of ways, connecting it particularly with &quot;luimnigthe&quot; (&quot;cloaked&quot;) and &quot;luimnechda&quot; (&quot;shielded&quot;).

==Early history==
Limerick&#x27;s early history is virtually undocumented, other than by the oral tradition, because the Vikings were diligent in destroying Irish public records. William Camden wrote that the Irish had been jealous about their antiquity since the deluge and were ambitious to memorialise important events for posterity. The earliest provable settlement dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King&#x27;s Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity&#x27;s map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 AD the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called &quot;Regia&quot; at the same site as King&#x27;s Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by St. Patrick in 434 to baptise an Eóganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 Danes sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the town, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number.

==Viking origins==

The earliest record of Vikings at Limerick is in 845, reported by the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, and there are intermittent reports of Vikings in the region later in the 9th century. Permanent settlement on the site of modern Limerick had begun by 922. In that year a Viking jarl or prince called Tomrair mac Ailchi—Thórir Helgason—led the Limerick fleet on raids along the River Shannon, from the lake of Lough Derg to the lake of Lough Ree, pillaging ecclesiastical settlements. Two years later, the Dublin Vikings led by Gofraid ua Ímair attacked Limerick, but were driven off. The war between Dublin and Limerick continued until 937 when the Dubliners, now led by Gofraid&#x27;s son Amlaíb, captured Limerick&#x27;s king Amlaíb Cenncairech and for some reason destroyed his fleet. However, no battle is actually recorded and so a traditional interpretation has been that Amlaíb mac Gofraid was actually recruiting Amlaíb of Limerick for his upcoming conflict with Athelstan of England, which would turn out be the famous Battle of Brunanburh. The 920s and 930s are regarded as the height of Norse power in Ireland and only Limerick rivalled Dublin during this time.

The last Norse King of Limerick was Ivar of Limerick, who features prominently as an enemy of Mathgamain mac Cennétig and later his famous brother Brian Boru in the &quot;Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib&quot;. He and his allies were defeated by the Dál gCais, and after slaying Ivar, Brian would annex Norse Limerick and begin to make it the new capital of his kingdom.
The power of the Norsemen never recovered, and they were reduced to the level of a minor clan; however, they often played pivotal parts in the endless power struggles of the next few centuries.

Brian Boru&#x27;s son, Donnchad (Donough), was routed by Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster, in the year 1058 when Limerick was burned, a punishment he repeated five years later. A year later Diarmait defeated Donnchad again forcing him to flee overseas and installing Turlough instead. Obviously Limerick was of great importance as evidenced by being a contentious issue between neighbouring chieftains and foreigners who burned and pillaged the city. Brian Boru&#x27;s sons were usually called Kings of north Munster though their reigns were rather disturbed until 1164 when Donnchad mac Briain became King of Munster. His reign was successful, founding monasteries and nunneries, constructing several monuments, including a church on the Rock of Cashel, and in his grant bestowing his Limerick Gothic palace to the church he styled himself &quot;King of Limerick&quot;. However the Danes were still a powerful force who were able to obtain four sequential Danish bishops concentrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury not subservient to the See of Cashel.

==Anglo-Norman era==

The arrival of the Normans to the area in 1173 changed everything. Domnall Mór Ua Briain, the last styled King of Limerick, burned the city to the ground in 1174 in a bid to keep it from the hands of the new invaders. After he died in 1194, the Normans finally captured the area in 1195, under the leadership of Prince John. In 1197, King Richard I of England granted the city its first charter, and its first Mayor, Adam Sarvant, ten years before London. A castle, built on the orders of King John and bearing his name, was completed around 1200. Under the general peace imposed by Norman rule, Limerick prospered as a port and trading centre. By this time the city was divided into an area which became known as &quot;English Town&quot; on King&#x27;s Island surrounded by high walls, while another settlement, named &quot;Irish Town&quot;, where the Irish and Danes lived, had grown on the south bank of the river. In 1216 King John further granted the areas North (as far as a tributary of the Shannon) and South of the River to City to be known as the &quot;Northern&quot; and &quot;Southern&quot; Liberties. Around 1395 construction started on walls around Irishtown that were not completed until the end of the 15th century.

The city opened a mint in 1467. A 1574 document prepared for the Spanish ambassador attests to its wealth:
Limerick is stronger and more beautiful than all the other cities of Ireland, well walled with stout walls of hewn marble...there is no entrance except by stone bridges, one of the two of which has 14 arches, and the other eight ... for the most part the houses are of square stone of black marble and built in the form of towers and fortresses.

Luke Gernon, an English-born judge and resident of Limerick, wrote a similar description in 1620:

Lofty building of marble; in the High Street it is built from one gate to the other in a single form, like the Colleges in Oxford, so magnificent that at my first entrance it did amaze me.
In the 15th and 16th centuries, Limerick became a city-state isolated from the principal area of effective English rule, the Pale. Nevertheless, the Crown remained in control throughout the succeeding centuries. During the Reformation tensions arose between those loyal to the Catholic Church and those loyal to the newly established state religion — the Church of Ireland.

==Siege and treaty==
Limerick was besieged several times in the 17th century. The first was in 1642, when the Irish Confederates took the King John&#x27;s Castle from its English garrison. The city was besieged by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army under Henry Ireton in 1651. The city had supported Confederate Ireland since 1642 and was garrisoned by troops from Ulster. The Confederates supported the claims of Charles II to the English throne, and the besiegers fought for a parliamentary republic. Famine and plague led to the death of 5,000 residents before heavy bombardment of Irishtown led to breach and surrender in late October of that year.

In the Williamite war in Ireland, following the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, French and Irish forces (numbering 14,000) regrouped in behind Limerick&#x27;s walls. Time and war had led to a terrible decay of the once proud fortifications. The occupying armies are recorded as claiming that the walls could be knocked down with rotten apples. The Williamite besiegers, while numbering 20,000, were hampered by the loss of their heavier guns to an attack by Patrick Sarsfield. In fierce fighting, the walls were breached on three occasions, but the defenders prevailed. Eventually, the Williamites withdrew to Waterford.

William&#x27;s forces returned in August 1691. Limerick was now the last stronghold of the Catholic Jacobites, under the command of Sarsfield. The promised French reinforcement failed to arrive from the sea, and following the massacre of 850 defenders on Thomond Bridge, the city sued for peace. On 3 October 1691 the famous Treaty of Limerick was signed using a large stone set in the bridge as a table. The treaty allowed the Jacobites to leave under full military honours and sail to France. Two days later French reinforcements finally arrived. Sarsfield was urged to continue the fight but refused, insisting on abiding by the terms of the treaty. Sarsfield sailed to France with 19,000 troops and formed the Irish Brigade (see also the Flight of the Wild Geese). From 1693 the Papacy supported James II again, and so the treaty was repudiated by the Williamites, for which the city became known as &quot;The City of the Violated Treaty&quot; and is a point of bitterness in the city to this day.

==Georgian Limerick and Newtown Pery==

While in 1695 the repressive penal laws were introduced that banned Catholics from public office, buying freehold land, voting or practising their religion in public, Limerick&#x27;s position as the main port on the western side of Ireland meant that the city, and the Protestant upper class and the Catholic merchant class, began to prosper. The British version of mercantilism required a great deal of trans-Atlantic trade, and Limerick profited somewhat by this. Many significant public buildings and infrastructure projects were paid for with local trade taxes. The first infirmary was founded by the surgeon Sylvester O&#x27;Halloran in 1761. The House of Industry was built on northern bank of the river in 1774, in part as a poorhouse and infirmary. The late 17th and early 18th century saw a rapid expansion of the city as Limerick took on the appearance of a Georgian City. It was during this time that the city centre took on its present-day look with the planned terraced Georgian Townhouses a characteristic of the city today. Georgian Limerick dates from this period as part of Edmund Sexton Pery&#x27;s plan for the development of a new city on lands he owned to the south of the existing medieval city. In 1765, he commissioned the Italian engineer Davis Ducart to design a town plan on those lands which have since become known as Newtown Pery. The town was built in stages as Pery sold off leases to builders and developers who built four- and five-story townhouses in the Georgian fashion with long wide and elegant streets in grid plan design with O&#x27;Connell Street (previously Georges street) being laid out at this time also and forming the centre of the new town. The earliest Georgian houses are located in John&#x27;s Square in the Irishtown district of medieval Limerick and along Bank Place, Rutland Street &amp; Patrick Street in the Newtown Pery district which were built by the Arthur family — a prominent Limerick family during the 18th century. Some of Ireland&#x27;s finest examples of Georgian Architecture can be seen at the Crescent area and Pery Square. A basic sewer system was built in Newtownpery in the reign of George III by simply closing over the gutters. By the time of George&#x27;s reign, Limerick had 17 gates in the city walls, most of whose names continue in modern city placenames. St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital was completed in the south-side by 1827. Wellesley Bridge (later, Sarsfield Bridge) and new wet docks were also built during this time. Chief imports through the port included timber, coal, iron and tar. Exports included beef, pork, wheat, oats, flour and emigrants bound for North America. Exports of food continued during the Great Famine, often requiring the deployment of troops to protect the port.

The new, broad wide and elegant streets of Newtown Pery quickly attracted the city&#x27;s wealthiest families who left the old overcrowded narrow lanes and streets of medieval Limerick (Englishtown &amp; Irishtown) and marked the decline of the ancient and medieval quarter of Limerick. These parts of the city were left to the poorer citizens of Limerick and became characterised by poverty and squalor. Unfortunately some tangible links to Limerick&#x27;s eventful past were lost as historically important buildings were lost due to lack of maintenance such as the Exchange, Ireton&#x27;s Castle (from the siege of Limerick), and a collection of Flemish and Dutch styled housing that started after the Glorious Revolution (with some surviving up to the mid 20th Century) that fronted onto Nicholas Street, Mary Street, Broad Street &amp; Mungret Street that were eventually knocked due to poor condition.

==Great Famine==

No statistics exist on how many people in the Limerick area died during the famine. Nationally, the population declined by an average of 20%, half of whom died and half emigrated. While the Great Famine reduced the population of County Limerick by 70,000, the population of the City actually rose slightly, as people fled to the workhouses.

Ships berthed on the Limerick quaysides ready to transport produce from one of the most fertile parts of Ireland, the Golden Vale, to the English ports. Francis Spaight, a Limerick merchant, farmer, British magistrate and ship owner, recorded 386,909 barrels of oats, and 46,288 barrels of wheat being shipped out of Limerick between June 1846 and May 1847. Giving evidence to a British parliament select committee inquiring into the famine, Spaight said that:
 I found so great an advantage of getting rid of the pauper population upon my own property that I made every possible exertion to remove them ... I consider the failure of the potato crop to be the greatest possible value in one respect in enabling us to carry out the emigration system.

The same quaysides were the departure point for many emigrant ships sailing over the Atlantic. One week in April 1850 saw four ships, &quot;Marie Brennan&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;Triumph&quot;, an 1849 Youghal built ship, and &quot;Hannah&quot;, the smallest emigrant ship, glide down the Shannon towards the Americas. The latter three ship had 357 people aboard mostly comprising young men and women, depriving Ireland of their vigour and prosperity which they would bring to other nations instead. The &quot;Hannah&quot; at 59 feet long could barely hold the 60 passengers and eight crew, yet made eight trans-Atlantic voyages.

==Boycott against Limerick Jews==

Census returns record one Jew in Limerick in 1861. This doubled by 1871 and doubled again by 1881. Increases to 35, 90 and 130 are shown for 1888, 1892, and 1896 respectively. A small number of Lithuanian Jewish tradespeople, fleeing persecution in their homeland, began arriving in Limerick in 1878. They initially formed an accepted part of the city&#x27;s retail trade, centred on Collooney St. The community established a synagogue and a cemetery in the 1880s. Easter Sunday of 1884 saw the first of what were to be a series of sporadic violent antisemitic attacks and protests. The wife of Lieb Siev and their child were injured by stones and their house damaged by an angry crowd for which the ringleaders were sentenced to hard labour for a month. In 1892 two families were beaten and a stoning took place on 24 November 1896. Many details about Limerick&#x27;s Jewish families are recorded in the 1901 census that shows most were peddlers, though a few were described as drapery dealers and grocers.

In 1904 a young Catholic priest, Father John Creagh, of the Redemptorist order, delivered a fiery sermon castigating Jews for rejecting the divinity of Jesus Christ, usury alliance with the Freemasons then persecuting the Catholic Church in France, taking over Limerick&#x27;s economy, selling shoddy goods at inflated prices paid in instalments. He urged Catholics &quot;not to deal with the Jews.&quot; Later, after 32 Jews left Limerick due to the agitation, Fr. Creagh was disowned by his superiors who said that: &quot;religious persecution had no place in Ireland.&quot; The Limerick Pogrom was the economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years. Keogh suggests the name derives from their previous Lithuanian experience even though no Jews in Limerick were killed or even seriously injured. Limerick&#x27;s Protestants, many of whom were also traders, supported the Jews throughout the pogrom, but ultimately five Jewish families left the city and 26 families remained.

Some went to Cork, intending to embark on ships from Cobh to travel to America. The people of Cork welcomed them into their homes. Church halls were opened for the refugees, many of whom remained. Gerald Goldberg, a son of this migration, became Lord Mayor of Cork in 1977, and the Marcus brothers, David and Louis, grandchildren of the pogrom, would become hugely influential in Irish literature and Irish film, respectively.

==Struggle for independence==
The IRA and the independence movement of Sinn Féin gained popular support in Limerick following the repressions and executions of 1916. Royal Irish Constabulary carried out violent raids on the homes of suspected Sinn Féin sympathisers. Prisoners were interned without trial in Frongoch camp in North Wales. Following the arrest and death of Robert Byrne, a local republican and trade unionist, most of Limerick city and a part of the county were declared a &quot;Special Military Area under the Defence of the Realm Act&quot;. Special permits, to be issued by the RIC, would now be required to enter the city. In response, the Limerick Trades and Labour Council called for a general strike and boycott of the troops. A special strike committee was set up to print their own money and control food prices. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; referred to this committee as a Limerick Soviet; however, the high degree of involvement of the Catholic Church shows that it was in fact quite different from the recent Bolshevik uprising. An American army officer arriving in Limerick had to appear before the permits committee to get a lift to visit relatives outside Limerick, following which he said,
I guess it is some puzzle to know who rules these parts. You have to get a military permit to get in and be brought before a committee to get a permit to leave.

After 14 days the strike ended with a compromise on the permits issue.

Open conflict erupted on Roches Street in April 1920 between the Royal Welch Fusiliers and the general population, involving bayonets on the one side and stones and bottles on the other. The troops fired indiscriminately, killing a publican and an usherette from the Coliseum Cinema. The British Government organised a new force to quell the population. The Black and Tans, known as &quot;the sweepings of English jails&quot;, were formed of ex-servicemen. On the night of 6 March 1921, Limerick&#x27;s Mayor, George Clancy, and his wife were shot in their home by three Tans. On the same night the previous Mayor, Michael O&#x27;Callaghan, and Volunteer Joe O&#x27;Donoghue were murdered in their own homes after curfew. These assassinations became known as the Curfew Murders. IRA reprisals included the unsuccessful attack on six RIC men leaving a pub on Mungret Street and the shooting dead of a Black and Tan on Church Street. A truce between the IRA and the British forces came into effect on 9 July 1921.

==Free State==

On 5 December 1921 Éamon de Valera gave a speech (in what is now The Strand Hotel on the Ennis Road) cautioning against optimism in the peace process. A few hours later in London, Michael Collins signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, granting limited independence to the southern portion of Ireland as the Irish Free State, while retaining the six counties of Northern Ireland. The treaty also gifted the ports of Berehaven, Cobh and Lough Swilly to the United Kingdom as UK sovereign bases, while annuities would continue to be paid to the British government in lieu of money loaned to Irish tenants under various land acts. De Valera and others virulently opposed the treaty&#x27;s compromises. The scene was set for the civil war.

In Limerick, the first signs of trouble came when the British forces withdrew early in the New Year. Three separate Irish factions rushed in to fill the vacuum: The pro-Treaty Claremen of the First-Western Division under General Michael Brennan, who was asked by the new Free-State government to occupy the city because of doubts about the loyalty of Liam Forde&#x27;s Mid-Limerick Brigade. In the event the Brigade split into pro- and anti-Treaty factions, the latter led by Forde.

William St. became a battle zone by 7 p.m. on 11 July 1922, when the Free State troops opened fire on the Republican garrison holding the Ordnance Barracks. In the chaos, Roches Stores, which still stands on Sarsfield St, was looted. On 17 July, Eoin O&#x27;Duffy arrived in the city as part of a nationwide offensive, in command of 1,500 Free State reinforcements equipped with artillery.

The Free State forces brought up an 18-pounder gun on the 19th and blasted a breach in walls of the Ordnance Barracks, which they then stormed. The Castle Barracks was captured the following day. The Republicans then abandoned the city, burning the barracks still in their hands. Limerick Prison, designed to hold 120, contained 800 prisoners by November. The fighting in the city in July 1922, left six Free State soldiers and 12 civilians dead, with a further 87 wounded. The press reports stated that about thirty Anti-Treaty IRA men had been killed but a recent study puts their fatalities at just five.

The Civil War ended the following May in victory for the Free State. De Valera and the Republicans would refuse to take their seats in the new Dáil Éireann until 1927.

The Free State government set about rebuilding the county in the spirit of the times, with grand plans and schemes. The Shannon Scheme, the plan to build a Hydroelectric power station utilising the energy of Ireland&#x27;s largest river, was begun in 1925. The German electric company Siemens-Schuckertwerke (today Siemens AG) was awarded the 5.2 million pound contract, providing employment for 750 people. The Electricity Supply Board set up to manage the project gradually oversaw the electrification of rural Ireland.

==The Emergency==

Almost from the moment that de Valera and his new Fianna Fáil party were elected in 1932, Ireland was plunged into a series of &quot;emergencies&quot;. De Valera fulfilled an election promise to suspend the payment of land annuities to Britain, and Britain retaliated by raising import duties on agricultural products to 40%. De Valera swept through the Dáil the &quot;Emergency Imposition of Duties order&quot; imposing reciprocal taxes. The Anglo-Irish Trade War had begun.

Limerick&#x27;s farm-based economy was reduced to a state of barter. This was the period during which Ireland&#x27;s interventionist, control economic style was developed. The Laissez-faireism of the 1920s was abandoned in the face of skyrocketing unemployment, poverty and emigration. The state set up non-agricultural industries such as Turf Development Board (Later Bord na Móna) and Aer Rianta (airports authority). In 1935 Charles Lindbergh was consulted on the building of an airport on the Shannon Estuary at Rineanna (later renamed Shannon Airport), and in 1937 Foynes was developed as a stopping point on the flying boat route across the Atlantic. During this time, the de Valera government introduced several &quot;emergency&quot; laws to suppress the IRA and General Eoin O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s Blueshirt Anti-Fianna Fáil supporters.

This first &quot;Emergency&quot; ended in 1938 with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, when Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement policy allowed a climb down. The UK would end economic sanctions and return the treaty ports in exchange for a once-off payment of £10m.

The following year, the outbreak of World War II forced the introduction of the Emergency Powers Act 1939 to control communications, media, prices and imports. Ireland, with no native merchant fleet, and no coal, gas, or oil supplies faced hard times indeed. An army officer named Captain McKenna described it as the day &quot;&quot;Realisation dawned on Ireland that the country was surrounded by water, and that the sea was of vital importance to her&quot;.&quot; Towards the end of the war, shortages of rubber and petrol particularly ended all non-emergency motorised transport, including rail, to and within the city. Lord Adare restarted a four-horse stagecoach route to his hotel in Co. Limerick, a sight not seen since the 19th century.

The army was expanded massively to over 300,000 in preparation for the expected invasion by either Germany, attempting a stepping-stone approach to the invasion of Britain, or Britain herself, seeking use of the ports. Knockalisheen barracks (later Knockalisheen Refugee Camp) was built near Limerick at Meelick to house the new defence forces.

==Post war==

The economy of the Limerick area was largely neglected in the post war period and the city and county became characterised by extremely high emigration and unemployment. With the exception of Shannon Airport and a few related businesses and a few clothing factories, Limerick had no industry. The economy was based on farming and services, fuelled in no insignificant part by remittances from the extensive diaspora. A few of the many who left became successful abroad, including the actor Richard Harris, the BBC presenter Terry Wogan, and the school teacher turned memoirist, Frank McCourt.

Limerick also had a few famous visitors during this time. In 1963 Irish-American US President John F. Kennedy visited Limerick as part of his tour of Ireland. He was presented with a locally produced christening robe made of Limerick Lace. From 1956, about 500 Hungarian refugees were housed in Knockalisheen, near Meelick a few kilometres from the city, following the failed uprising in their country. A few settled, but the majority moved on within a few years to new lives in the UK and North America due to the bad economic situation in Limerick.

Shannon Airport also attracted a varied crowd. At this time nearly all transatlantic flights stopped at the airport, the most westerly in Europe, to refuel. &quot;Irish Times&quot; journalist Arthur Quinlan who was based at Shannon boasts at having interviewed every US president from Harry Truman to George H. W. Bush and many Soviet leaders, including Andrey Vyshinsky and Andrei Gromyko. He also famously taught Fidel Castro how to make an Irish coffee and interviewed Che Guevara. On 13 March 1965, Guevara suddenly arrived at the airport when his flight from Prague to Cuba developed mechanical problems, and Quinlan was on hand to interview him. Guevara talked of his Irish connections through the name Lynch and of his grandmother&#x27;s Irish roots in Galway. Later, Che, and some of his Cuban comrades, went to Limerick city and adjourned to the Hanratty&#x27;s Hotel on Glentworth Street. According to Quinlan, they returned that evening all wearing sprigs of shamrock, for Shannon and Limerick were preparing for the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations.

In 1968, the government published the Buchanan Report on the regional dimension to economic planning which had largely been ignored. The report recommended on the social and economic sustainability of industry in the regions, which gradually lead to investment and improvement in the Limerick area.

==Celtic Tiger==

The seemingly sudden economic growth of the 1990s, termed the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;, making Ireland one of the richest countries in the world, had deep foundations stretching back through the 1980s and 1970s. Shipping in Shannon estuary was developed extensively during the period with more than two billion pounds investment. A tanker terminal at Foynes and an oil jetty at Shannon Airport were built. In 1982 a massive alumina extraction plant was built at Aughinish. Now, 60,000-ton cargo vessels carry raw bauxite from West African mines to the plant, where it is refined to alumina. This is then exported to Canada, where it is further refined to aluminium. In 1985, a huge power plant began operating at Moneypoint, fed by regular visits by 150,000-tonne tankers. European Economic Community funding was poured into infrastructure. Industrial estates at Raheen and Plassey (Castletroy), and energetic government intervention, brought in numerous foreign firms, notably Analog Devices, Wang Laboratories and Dell Computers. A science and engineering focused third-level college called &quot;NIHE, Limerick&quot;, elevated in 1989 to university status as the University of Limerick, and the establishment of Limerick Institute of Technology (now the Technological University of the Shannon) furthered the area&#x27;s reputation as Ireland&#x27;s Silicon Valley. Thomond College of Education, Limerick was a successful teacher training college and was integrated into LIT (now TUS) in 1991.

In 1996, the city had a brief moment of world attention when the Irish writer Frank McCourt published &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. The book tells of the author&#x27;s childhood in a rundown and dirty slum of the 1930s and 40s, In 1999, it was made into a feature film. The slums spoken of in the book had long since been removed, and local people were embarrassed by the sudden unflattering discussion of the city. When McCourt wrote the book&#x27;s sequel, &quot;&#x27;Tis&quot;, it was answered with the locally written &quot;Tisn&#x27;t&quot;, which painted a better face on the city.

The appearance of the city has been undergoing a gradual face-lift: two new bridges over the Shannon, and a newly opened tunnel complete the orbital road; many of the older buildings have been replaced, some controversially such as the ancient Cruises Hotel (see Architecture of Limerick). Former city architect, Jim Barrett, led the way in turning Limerick around to face the river. Ireland&#x27;s third tallest building, the Riverpoint, was completed in 2008 near the Bishop&#x27;s Quay, overlooking the Shannon. The new wealth not only halted the high levels of emigration chronic through the 1980s, but led to the first large-scale immigration for centuries. The city now boasts a Russian delicatessen, a Chinese supermarket and several South Asian, African and Caribbean food shops. Near the Crescent Shopping Centre, and down the road from the LDS Church, is Limerick&#x27;s first Mosque.

==Post-2008 Crash==

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and the resulting Post-2008 Irish economic downturn caused economic damage to Limerick. Like other cities in Ireland, house prices collapsed by 50% from the pre-crash highs and took more than a decade to recover. As of 2017, the economy is recovering at a steady rate.

Today, Limerick has lifted itself to become the capital of the Mid-west region of Ireland. The city hosts many large US Multinational companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care (Ireland) in Castletroy, Regeneron and Eli-lily in Raheen and Verizon in the city centre. The University of Limerick has established a campus on Sarsfield Street in the city and the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare, O&#x27;Connell Street, has received a major facelift. The city remains a centrepoint for retail, hospitality and services.

<text>Viscount Midleton, of Midleton in the County of Cork, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1717 for Alan Brodrick, 1st Baron Brodrick, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and former Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. He was created Baron Brodrick, of Midleton in the County of Cork, in 1715 in the same peerage. His grandson, the third Viscount, co-represented Ashburton then New Shoreham in the British House of Commons. His son, the fourth Viscount, sat similarly for Whitchurch for 22 years. In 1796 he was created Baron Brodrick, of Peper Harow in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with a special remainder to the heirs male of his father, the third Viscount. On the death of his son, the fifth Viscount, this line of the family failed. 

He was succeeded by his first cousin, the sixth Viscount. He was the eldest son of Charles Brodrick, Archbishop of Cashel, fourth son of the third Viscount. His nephew, the eighth Viscount, briefly represented Mid Surrey in the House of Commons as a Conservative and served as Lord Lieutenant of Surrey between 1896 and 1905. His son, the ninth Viscount, was a prominent Conservative politician and government minister (1880-1906) and from 1910 was the nominal leader of the Irish Unionist Alliance (IUA) in Southern Ireland. Successful lobbying by him and associated Southern Unionists was instrumental in ensuring their representation in the Seanad of the Irish Free State however he failed to win some safeguards for fellow Southern Unionists in the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. In 1920 he was created Earl of Midleton and Viscount Dunsford, of Dunsford in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom which titles became extinct on the death of his son, the second Earl, in 1979. 

The Irish titles and barony of Brodrick passed on to his second cousin, the eleventh Viscount. He was the grandson of Reverend the Hon. Alan Brodrick, youngest son of the seventh Viscount. the titles are held by the eleventh Viscount&#x27;s son, the twelfth Viscount, who succeeded in 1988.

The ancestral seat of the Brodrick family was Peper Harow, its final form commissioned by the third Viscount, near Godalming, Surrey. The house was sold in 1944 by the second Earl of Midleton. The family&#x27;s original seat was Ballyannan Castle near Midleton in County Cork, which they occupied until , but continued to own; it was becoming a ruin by 1837.

<text>Eye Spy&quot; Magazine(International Intelligence&quot; Magazine in the United Kingdom) was a magazine published by Eye Spy Publishing Ltd. from North Yorkshire, England until 2020. In the United States, it was edited in New York City, in the Empire State Building.

==History and profile==
Eye Spy was started by Mark Birdsall in 2000. The magazine dealt with international intelligence stories, many of which had to do with such subjects as Al Qaeda, the destruction of TWA flight 800, the ex-Soviet Union, spies and their careers, the history of espionage, global terrorism and a wide array of other controversial issues all of which have to do with &#x27;intelligence&#x27;.

The magazine claimed to obtain its information from intelligence group sources worldwide. &quot;Eye Spy&quot; featured articles which discuss and analyze &#x27;James Bond&#x27; style spy technology on a perfectly serious level. There were also often glowing endorsements of training courses or instructional material marketed by companies linked to some of the magazine&#x27;s regular contributors. The magazine reported that it was required reading for actual intelligence industry professionals.

&quot;Eye Spy&quot; was an independent magazine and was sold in 36 countries.

<text>Harpalinae is the largest subfamily of ground beetles, containing more than 19,000 species worldwide. 


== Biology ==
This subfamily contains the most apomorphic ground beetles, displaying a wide range of forms and behaviors. The morphology of species within Harpalinae range from ant-mimics to charismatic members within the genus &quot;Pterostichus.&quot; Some exhibit rare feeding habits among ground beetles, including both omnivorous and even herbivorous species. Some members of Harpalinae, especially those restricted to the tropics, are considered to be arboreal. This variety of habitats has been considered to lead to the wide diversification of morphological traits.

== Systematics ==
Recent phylogenetic analysis of Harpalinae has placed approximately 19,000 species within around 40 tribes in this subfamily with nearby sister subfamily clades having species numbers in the hundreds or lower. Few subfamilies within Carabidae have been recovered as supported. The monophyly of Harpalinae has been established with respect to ribosomal DNA and the &quot;wingless&quot; gene. Further evidence to support this monophyly includes the similarities across the subfamily of their defensive secretions. Further phylogenetic analyses have recovered Brachininae and Trechinae as a clade with Harpalinae. As mentioned above, members in Harpalinae evolved to be arboreal. The evolution of these members involved multiple gains and losses of characters, with the evolution of arboreality originating and reversing several times. With a variety of behaviors and habitats, Harpalinae species are predicted to have had a diversification rate greater than that of the angiosperms.

== Fossil record ==
Fossil records and evolutionary history show that tribes within Harpalinae likely arose and diversified during the mid-Cretaceous period. A first fossil of a member of Harpalinae was dated to be from the late-Cretaceous period, and extant species of Harpalinae were found in Baltic amber.

== Ecology ==
Members of Harpalinae fulfill a variety of ecological niches. These include various symbioses with other insects, ovoviviparity, and even ectoparasitism. Harpaline beetles, like other ground beetles, have pygidial glands that are used for defensive secretions, some secretions containing formic acid. Members of Harpalinae are even considered agents of biological pest control, especially in agricultural settings. While likely not having co-evolved with the angiosperms, angiosperm radiation likely lead to the diversification of ecological niches in Harpalinae.

== Tribes ==
The subfamily Harpalinae contains around 40 tribes, consisting of 19,000 species worldwide. The variety of morphologies within Harpalinae make phylogenetic placements of tribes harder to establish without the support of genetic evidence. Molecular phylogenies may even point to such a rapid speciation of Harpalinae, showing some of these tribes arising at the same time. Supertribes have been constructed based on traits such as chemical defense structures, male and female reproductive structures, elytra morphology, and habitats. While these relationships are not entirely resolved, listed below are tribes currently pertaining to Harpalinae.

<doc id="803044" wikidata="Q720603" url="?curid=803044" title="George Stoneman">
<text>George Stoneman Jr. (August 8, 1822 – September 5, 1894) was a United States Army cavalry officer and politician who served as the 15th governor of California from 1883 to 1887.

Stoneman trained at West Point, graduating in 1846, and served in the U.S. Army for 36 years. He was involved in multiple conflicts, including the Mexican–American War, the Yuma War, and the American Civil War. In 1861, Stoneman was promoted to Brigadier General, and was later put in command of the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Corps, and subsequently the newly created cavalry corps.

At the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, under the command of Joseph Hooker, Stoneman failed in an ambitious attempt to penetrate behind enemy lines, getting bogged down at an important river crossing. Hooker placed much of the blame for the Union army&#x27;s defeat on Stoneman. His sharp criticism may have been in part intended to deflect blame placed on himself for the North&#x27;s defeat.

While commanding cavalry under William Tecumseh Sherman in Georgia, Stoneman was captured by Confederate soldiers, but soon exchanged. 
Shortly after the end of the American Civil War, Stoneman commanded occupying troops at Memphis, Tennessee, who were stationed at Fort Pickering. He had turned over control of law enforcement to the civilian government by May 1866, when the Memphis riots broke out and the major black neighborhoods were destroyed. When the city asked for help, he suppressed the rioting with the use of federal troops. He later moved out to California, where he had an estate in the San Gabriel Valley. He was elected as governor of California, serving between 1883 and 1887. He was not nominated a second time.

==Early life and military service==
Stoneman was born on a family farm in Busti, New York, the first child of ten. His parents were George Stoneman Sr., a lumberman and justice of the peace, and Catherine Rebecca Cheney Aldrich. He studied at the Jamestown Academy and entered the United States Military Academy in 1842; his roommate at West Point was future Confederate General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. He graduated 33rd in his class of 59 cadets in 1846. Stoneman was commissioned as a second Lieutenant in the Mormon Battalion, which from 1846 to 1847 made the march from Iowa to California, to participate in the Mexican–American War, though by the time the battalion arrived, California was controlled by the United States, and his unit never actually saw combat. Stoneman was assistant quartermaster for the march. He fought in the Yuma War and was responsible for survey parties mapping the Sierra Nevada range for railroad lines. After promotion to captain of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry in March 1855, he served mainly in Texas until 1861.

==Civil War service==
At the start of the Civil War Stoneman was in command of Fort Brown, Texas, and refused the order of Maj. Gen. David E. Twiggs, a southern sympathizer, to surrender to the newly established Confederate authorities there, escaping to the north with most of his command. Returning east, he was reassigned to the 1st US Cavalry and promoted to major on May 9, 1861. Stoneman then served as adjutant to General George McClellan during his campaign in Western Virginia during the summer. After McClellan became commander of the newly formed Army of the Potomac, he assigned Stoneman as his chief of cavalry; Stoneman was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on August 13. Stoneman had a difficult relationship with McClellan, who did not understand the proper use of cavalry in warfare, relegating it to assignment in small units to infantry brigades.

On November 22, 1861, Stoneman married Mary Oliver Hardisty of Baltimore. They had four children.

Following the failures of the Peninsula campaign, Stoneman was reassigned to the infantry, and received command of the 1st Division of the III Corps on September 10 after its former commander, Maj. Gen. Phil Kearny, had been killed a week earlier. The III Corps remained in Washington, D.C., during the Maryland campaign. On October 30, Stoneman was placed in command of the entire III corps. At Fredericksburg, it formed part of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker&#x27;s Center Grand Division and helped drive back a Confederate assault during the battle. Following Fredericksburg, Hooker became commander of the Army of the Potomac and decided to re-organize the cavalry into a single corps with Stoneman at its head.

===Stoneman&#x27;s raids===

The plan for the Battle of Chancellorsville was strategically daring. Hooker assigned Stoneman a key role in which his Cavalry Corps would raid deeply into Robert E. Lee&#x27;s rear areas and destroy vital railroad lines and supplies, distracting Lee from Hooker&#x27;s main assaults. However, Stoneman was a disappointment in this strategic role. The Cavalry Corps got off to a good start in May 1863, but quickly bogged down after crossing the Rapidan River. During the entire battle, Stoneman accomplished little, and Hooker considered him one of the principal reasons for the Union defeat at Chancellorsville. Hooker needed to deflect criticism from himself and relieved Stoneman of his cavalry command, sending him back to Washington, D.C., for medical treatment (chronic hemorrhoids, exacerbated by cavalry service), where in July he became a Chief of the U.S. Cavalry Bureau, a desk job. A large cavalry supply and training depot on the Potomac River was named Camp Stoneman in his honor.

In early 1864, Stoneman was impatient with garrison duty in Washington and requested another field command from his old friend Maj. Gen. John Schofield, who was in command of the Department of the Ohio. Although originally slated for an infantry corps, Stoneman assumed command of the Cavalry Corps of what would be known as the Army of the Ohio. As the army fought in the Atlanta Campaign under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, Stoneman commanded an unsuccessful raid of the infamous Andersonville Prison. In the course of the raid he and his aide, Myles Keogh were captured by Confederates outside of Macon, Georgia. However, the 5th Indiana Cavalry Regiment under Col. Thomas Butler made a valiant stand, allowing the rest of his forces to retreat. They were surrendered as well, despite protest by Col. Butler. Stoneman became the highest-ranking Union prisoner of war, and he remained prisoner for three months.

Stoneman was exchanged relatively quickly due to the personal request of General Sherman. Following his release, Stoneman was briefly the commander of the Department of the Ohio. In December 1864, Stoneman led a raid through southwestern Virginia. In March 1865, Stoneman took roughly 4,000 troops out of Knoxville, Tennessee, and led them on a raid of Virginia and North Carolina, the intent being to cripple Confederate infrastructure and demoralize the population. Within a week, they had sacked the towns of Hillsville, Asheville, and Christiansburg, among others, and destroyed several bridges, lead mines and railroads.

==Postbellum politics==
In June 1865, following the end of war, Stoneman was put in command of the Department of Tennessee in occupied Memphis. Stoneman was criticized for inaction in the early days of the 1866 Memphis riots, which may have increased the damage. Stoneman was subject to a congressional investigation, but was exonerated.

Stoneman was assigned to administer the military government in the sub-district of Petersburg, Virginia, and in 1868, he assumed command of the First Military District. A Democrat who was opposed to the radical Reconstruction, Stoneman pursued more moderate policies than the other Military Governors, which garnered him support among white Virginians.

Stoneman mustered out of volunteer service on September 1, 1866, and reverted to the regular army rank of colonel. In 1869, the Army transferred him out west to command the District of Arizona (1869–1870) and subsequently the Department of Arizona (1870–71). Stoneman was relieved of his command due to controversies surrounding his handling of the region&#x27;s Indians, including the Camp Grant massacre. On August 16, 1871, Stoneman was granted a disability retirement at his brevetted rank of Major General. Three days later, however, President Ulysses S. Grant revoked his disability licence, forcing him to retire at the rank of colonel.

Stoneman was a First Class Companion of the California Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==California==

Stoneman moved to California, the place of which he had dreamed since his service as a young officer before the war. He and his wife settled in the San Gabriel Valley on a estate called &quot;Los Robles,&quot; which is now a California Historical Landmark. He was appointed to the California Transportation Commission in 1876. In 1879 he was elected California Railroad Commissioner with the support of the Democratic, Workingmen&#x27;s, and New Constitution parties.

In 1882, Stoneman was elected governor of California as a Democrat and served a single four-year term. During his tenure, he advocated controlling the rates and limiting the power of the Southern Pacific Railroad; however, he was unsuccessful in his efforts against the railroad-controlled legislature. Stoneman also was a proponent of prison reform, believing prisoners could be rehabilitated through parole. He granted 260 pardons and commuted 146 prison sentences in the last few weeks of his term. Stoneman was not renominated for governor in 1886; he left office and retired from public service.

He returned to New York State for medical treatment, and to stay with his sister, Charlotte S. Williams. He suffered a stroke in April 1894 from which he was unable to recover. Stoneman died in Buffalo, New York, on September 5, 1894, at age 72 and was buried at Bentley Cemetery in Lakewood, New York.

==Legacy and honors==

Stoneman&#x27;s raids into North Carolina and Virginia in the last weeks of the war were memorialized by songwriter Robbie Robertson of The Band, in the 1969 song &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;.

Stoneman is not mentioned in the 1971 recording of the song by Joan Baez, in which she substitutes &quot;so much cavalry&quot; for &quot;Stoneman&#x27;s cavalry&quot;. Baez told Kurt Loder of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that she had learned the song by listening to the track on The Band&#x27;s album. Having never seen the printed lyrics, she sang the words as she (mis)heard them.

Stoneman Avenue in Alhambra, California, was named in his honor. Camp Stoneman, near Pittsburg, California, was the place from which many soldiers shipped out to the Pacific Theater in World War II and the Korean War. Stoneman Elementary School in San Marino, California, is built on Stoneman&#x27;s Los Robles Ranch property. In 1885, California, which owned Yosemite at the time, built a luxury hotel with accommodations for 150 guests near the present location of Curry Village and named the hotel Stoneman House. The adjoining Stoneman Meadow takes its name from the hotel. The nearby Stoneman Bridge takes its name from the meadow. The hotel burned to the ground in 1896. Stoneman Lake in Arizona is also named in his honor. General George Stoneman Business Park, the site of the Southern Tier Brewery, is located on the Stoneman family farm in the town of Busti, New York.

General Stoneman&#x27;s name is engraved on the Sonoma Veterans Memorial Park Star of Honor due to his time there before the Civil War.

<text>Earl Brassey was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1911 for the Liberal politician and former Governor of Victoria, Australia, Thomas Brassey, 1st Baron Brassey, eldest son of the railway magnate Thomas Brassey (1805-1870). He had already been created Baron Brassey, of Bulkeley in the County Palatine of Chester, in 1886, and was made Viscount Hythe, of Hythe in the County of Kent, at the same time as he was granted the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The titles became extinct upon the death of his son, the second Earl, in 1919.

Henry Brassey, 1st Baron Brassey of Apethorpe was the nephew of the first Earl.

<text>George Johnstone Stoney (15 February 1826 – 5 July 1911) was an Irish physicist known for introducing the term &quot;electron&quot; as the &quot;fundamental unit quantity of electricity&quot;.

He initially named it &quot;electrolion&quot; in 1881, and later named it “electron” in 1891. He published around 75 scientific papers during his lifetime.

==Education and employment ==
Stoney was born at Oakley Park, near Birr, County Offaly, in the Irish Midlands, the son of George Stoney (1792–) and Anne Blood (1801–1883). The Stoney family is an old-established Anglo-Irish family. He attended Trinity College Dublin, graduating with a B.A. degree in 1848. From 1848 to 1852 he worked as an astronomy assistant to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse at Birr Castle, County Offaly, where Parsons had built the world&#x27;s largest telescope, the 72-inch Leviathan of Parsonstown. Simultaneously Stoney continued to study physics and mathematics and was awarded an M.A. by Trinity College Dublin in 1852.

From 1852 to 1857, Stoney was professor of physics at Queen&#x27;s College Galway. From 1857 to 1882, he was employed as Secretary of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland, an administrative job based in Dublin. In the early 1880s, he moved to the post of superintendent of Civil Service Examinations in Ireland, a post he held until his retirement in 1893. In that year, he took up residence in London, England. Stoney died in 1911 at his home in Notting Hill, London. Stoney continued his independent scientific research throughout his decades of non-scientific employment duties in Dublin. He also served for decades as honorary secretary and then vice-president of the Royal Dublin Society, a scientific society modelled after the Royal Society of London, and after his move to London Stoney served on the council of that society too. Additionally, he intermittently served on scientific review committees of the British Association for the Advancement of Science from the early 1860s on.

==Scientific output==
Stoney published seventy-five scientific papers in a variety of journals, but chiefly in the journals of the Royal Dublin Society. He made significant contributions to cosmic physics and to the theory of gases. He estimated the number of molecules in a cubic millimetre of gas, at room temperature and pressure, from data obtained from the kinetic theory of gases. Stoney&#x27;s most important scientific work was the conception and calculation of the magnitude of the &quot;atom of electricity&quot;. In 1891, he proposed the term &quot;electron&quot; to describe the fundamental unit of electrical charge, and his contributions to research in this area laid the foundations for the eventual discovery of the particle by J. J. Thomson in 1897.

His scientific work was carried out in his spare time. A heliostat designed by Stoney is in the Science Museum Group collection.

Stoney was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1861 on the basis of being &quot;the author of papers on &quot;The Propagation of Waves&quot;, &quot;On the Rings seen in Fibrous Specimens of Calc Spar&quot;, and Molecular Physics, published in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, et cetera, Distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of Astronomy &amp; General Physics&quot;.

===Stoney units===

Stoney proposed the first system of natural units in 1881. He realized that a fixed amount of charge was transferred per chemical bond affected during electrolysis, the elementary charge &quot;e&quot;, which could serve as a unit of charge, and that combined with other known universal constants, namely the speed of light &quot;c&quot; and the Newtonian constant of gravitation &quot;G&quot;, a complete system of units could be derived. He showed how to derive units of mass, length, time and electric charge as base units. Due to the form in which Coulomb&#x27;s law was expressed, the constant 4&quot;πε&quot;0 was implicitly included, &quot;ε&quot;0 being the vacuum permittivity.

Like Stoney, Planck independently derived a system of natural units (of similar scale) some decades after him, using different constants of nature.

Hermann Weyl made a notable attempt to construct a unified theory by associating a gravitational unit of charge with the Stoney length. Weyl&#x27;s theory led to significant mathematical innovations but his theory is generally thought to lack physical significance.

== Family ==
Stoney married his cousin, Margaret Sophia Stoney; they had two sons and three daughters. For most of his decades in Dublin, Stoney resided in the Dundrum, Dublin neighbourhood. The street that he lived on was later renamed Stoney Road in his memory. After Stoney died in London, his cremated ashes were buried in St. Nahi&#x27;s Church in Dundrum.

One of Stoney&#x27;s sons, George Gerald Stoney FRS, was a scientist. His daughter Florence Stoney OBE was a radiologist while his daughter Edith is considered to be the first woman medical physicist. Stoney&#x27;s most scientifically notable relative was his nephew, the Dublin-based physicist George Francis FitzGerald (1851–1901).

His brother was the engineer Bindon Blood Stoney.

He was second cousin of the grandfather of Ethel Sara Turing, mother of Alan Turing.

==Legacy==

Stoney received an honorary Doctorate of Science (D.Sc.) from the University of Dublin in June 1902.

Stoney and FitzGerald were in regular communication on scientific matters. In addition, on political matters, both Stoney and FitzGerald were active opponents of the Irish Home Rule Movement. In their political opinion, the spirit of Irish Home Rule and later Irish nationalism was contrary to the spirit of science. Stoney resigned from his job as Secretary of Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland in 1882 in objection to a government decision to introduce &quot;sectarianism&quot; into the system; i.e., Stoney wanted to keep the system non-denominational, but the government acceded to Irish Catholic demands for Catholic institutions.

In 1902, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honour.

<text>Earl Roberts, of Kandahar in Afghanistan and Pretoria in the Transvaal Colony and of the City of Waterford, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1901 for Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, 1st Baron Roberts. He had already been created Baron Roberts, of Kandahar in Afghanistan, and of the City of Waterford, in 1892, and was made Viscount St Pierre at the same time as he was given the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The barony was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body while the viscountcy and earldom were created with special remainders to his daughters and the heirs male of their bodies, as his sons had already predeceased him. The barony became extinct on Lord Roberts&#x27;s death in 1914. He was succeeded in the viscountcy and earldom according to the special remainders by his eldest daughter, the second Countess. She died unmarried and was succeeded by her younger sister, the third Countess. The latter’s son and only child Lieutenant Frederick Roberts Alexander Lewin was killed in action in the Second World War and consequently the viscountcy and earldom became extinct on the third Countess’s death in 1955.

==Family==
Frederick Roberts was the son of Sir Abraham Roberts, who was also a distinguished soldier and general.

<doc id="803068" wikidata="Q6908378" url="?curid=803068" title="Moorfield Storey">
<text>Moorfield Storey (March 19, 1845 – October 24, 1929) was an American lawyer, anti-imperial activist, and civil rights leader based in Boston, Massachusetts. According to Storey&#x27;s biographer, William B. Hixson Jr., he had a worldview that embodied &quot;pacifism, anti-imperialism, and racial egalitarianism fully as much as it did laissez-faire and moral tone in government.&quot; Storey served as the founding president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), serving from 1909 to his death in 1929. He opposed United States expansionism beginning with the Spanish–American War.

==Early life==
Moorfield Storey was born in 1845 in Roxbury, Massachusetts, then a suburb of Boston. His family was descended from the earliest Puritan settlers in New England and had close connections with the abolitionist movement. Storey&#x27;s father was a Boston lawyer. The young Storey went to the Boston Latin School and graduated in 1862, during the beginning of the Civil War. He then continued onto Harvard University, where he was a member of the Glee Club, graduating in 1866, and then studied at Harvard Law School. In a speech almost thirty years later at Cambridge University, Storey discussed the mindset of the young men of his generation, stating that &quot;a great movement for intellectual, religious, and political freedom was just culminating&quot;.

==Career==
Storey established a law practice in Boston, Massachusetts as a founding partner of the firm Storey, Thorndike, Palmer, Dodge (Currently &quot;Locke Lord LLP&quot;). From 1873 to 1879 he was editor of the &quot;American Law Review&quot;. He was elected president of the American Bar Association in 1896, and was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as president of the Massachusetts Bar Association during 1913–14.

He was a well-known person in the &quot;Mugwump&quot; movement of 1884, and actively supported Grover Cleveland. As a strong believer in the gold standard, freedom of contract, and property rights, Storey opposed the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan and supported the National Democratic Party (Gold Democrats) third-party ticket in 1896. In 1887 he built a house on Great Cranberry Island.

An opponent of military intervention, Storey spoke at the first anti-imperialist mass meeting in Boston in June 1898, called because of the Spanish–American War. He was a vice president of the New England Anti-Imperialist League. In addition, he wrote a book brief for the Lodge Committee summarizing the war crimes of the Philippine–American War. From 1905 until its dissolution in 1921 Storey was the Anti-Imperialist League&#x27;s President. He perceived that &quot;national subjugation overseas and racial persecution at home were related,&quot; which drove his efforts at reform.

Storey was known to work 16-hour days, even into his later years. He was a fighter for unpopular issues, and as Bliss Perry wrote in his obituary for Storey, he was &quot;usually in the minority at any given time.&quot; Storey himself was quoted as saying &quot;It is not success to fight on the winning side. It is success to fight bravely for a principle even if one does not live to see it triumph.&quot; This determination to fight for the right, even if he did not win, led him to cross political swords with Presidents William Howard Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and United States Secretary of War Elihu Root.

==1900 Congressional campaign==
Late in the campaign of 1900, Storey seriously pondered running for president on a third-party ticket but decided against it as impractical. Instead, he ran a losing, but spirited and high-profile campaign for Congress as an independent anti-imperialist candidate. Other planks in his platform included support for the gold standard and free trade.

==Champion of civil rights==
Storey consistently and aggressively championed civil rights, not only for blacks but also for American Indians and immigrants. He opposed immigration restrictions, and supported racial equality and self-determination. 

&quot;When the white man governs himself, that is self-government,&quot; he declared, &quot;but when he governs himself and also governs another man, that is more than self-government–that is despotism.&quot;
Storey was the first president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), from its founding in 1909 until his death in 1929. According to his biographer Hixson, he &quot;launched and maintained the effective campaign to achieve the total destruction of the legal embodiment of white supremacy.&quot; He guided NAACP&#x27;s legal challenges to discriminatory laws that violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, especially related to disenfranchisement and segregation of blacks in the South, and led several important NAACP legal victories. Most notably, he was lead counsel before the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Buchanan v. Warley&quot; (1917). In that case, the Court unanimously overturned a Louisville law that racially segregated blacks by specific city blocks. The Court&#x27;s opinion reflected the jurisprudence of property rights and freedom of contract as embodied in the earlier precedent it had established in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;.

On February 17, 1916, he testified in opposition to the nomination of Louis D. Brandeis to the United States Supreme Court. Storey was on the conservative side in the Sacco and Vanzetti case.

Storey was, with James Weldon Johnson, the organizer of the 1919 National Conference on Lynching.

In 1920 Storey led the NAACP to take on the defense of the Elaine Twelve in their appeals from convictions for murder and the death penalty. The NAACP raised $50,000 for their defense, hiring two attorneys to manage the appeals in Arkansas. The cases were broken into two tracks because of technical trial issues, and six men (Ware et al.) were retried beginning in May 1920 after their defense team won the first appeal at the state supreme court. Storey worked with the team as the cases of six other men (Moore et al.) later reached the United States Supreme Court. In its ruling in &quot;Moore v. Dempsey&quot; (1923), the Court set an important precedent for reviewing state criminal cases against the standard of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and application of Bill of Rights to state actions.

==Later life==
In the 1920s, Storey opposed the U.S. occupations of Haiti and of the Dominican Republic as the chairperson of the Haiti-Santo Domingo Independence Society. He was also on the advisory committee of the American Fund for Public Service Committee on American Imperialism.

He died in Lincoln, Massachusetts in 1929, survived by four of his five children with Gertrude Cutts, whom he had married in 1870. She had died in 1912. His children were Charles Moorfield Storey, Elizabeth Storey Lovett, Richard Storey, Gertude Storey Burke and Katharine Storey Donald.

==Friendship with Edward Waldo Emerson and the Emerson family==

Storey was longtime friends with Edward Waldo Emerson, son of famous American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. The two were in the same graduating class at Harvard. Just after their graduation, Storey was one of two friends that accompanied Emerson on a camping trip. Also among the party was the elder Emerson, as well as Transcendentalist poet William Ellery Channing. The camping party encountered a fierce storm on their second night out, and Storey worked to lighten the mood by singing through storm, with the younger Emerson joining in to sing the chorus. The event is recorded in Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s journals of the time. The two men&#x27;s friendship continued for the next several decades, and they wrote a biography of former United States Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar together in 1911.

==Time with Charles Sumner==

From 1867 to 1869, Storey was a clerk for the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and served as a private secretary to its chairman, Senator Charles Sumner. Storey was introduced to Sumner through his father, and moved to the Senator&#x27;s house after his graduation from Harvard University. He accepted the position as it seemed the best route to continue his legal studies. Storey spent two years of his life as the Senator&#x27;s right-hand man and one of his only friends, as the progressive Sumner had made many enemies in Washington. During his tenure, he initially supported the removal of President Andrew Johnson from office but soon became disenchanted by what he viewed as the corruption and opportunism of politicians on both sides. He was admitted to the bar in 1869.

==Legacy==
Writer and editor Damon W. Root touted Storey as an historical role model for libertarian Democrats in a December 2007 article for &quot;Reason Magazine&quot;.

<text>William Wetmore Story (February 12, 1819 – October 7, 1895) was an American sculptor, art critic, poet, and editor.

==Life and career==

William Wetmore Story was the son of jurist Joseph Story and Sarah Waldo (Wetmore) Story. He graduated from Harvard College in 1838 and the Harvard Law School in 1840. After graduation, he continued his law studies under his father, was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, and prepared two legal treatises of value – &quot;Treatise on the Law of Contracts not under Seal&quot; (2 vols., 1844) and &quot;Treatise on the Law of Sales of Personal Property&quot; (1847).

He soon abandoned the law though to devote himself to sculpture, and after 1850 lived in Rome, where he had first visited in 1848, and where he counted among his friends the Brownings and Walter Savage Landor. In 1856, he received a commission for a bust of his late father, now in the Memorial Hall/Lowell Hall, Harvard University. Story&#x27;s apartment in Palazzo Barberini became a central location for Americans in Rome. During the American Civil War his letters to the &quot;Daily News&quot; in December 1861 (afterwards published as a pamphlet, &quot;The American Question&quot;, i.e. of neutrality), and his articles in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, had considerable influence on English opinion.

One of his most famous works, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, (1858) was described and admired in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s 1860 romance, &quot;The Marble Faun&quot;, and is on display in New York, NY at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Gallery 700. Another work, the &quot;Angel of Grief&quot;, has been replicated near the Stanford Mausoleum at Stanford University. Among the other life-size statues he completed were those of &quot;Saul&quot;, &quot;Sappho&quot;, &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Semiramide&quot;, &quot;Delilah&quot;, &quot;Judith&quot;, &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem Desolate&quot;, &quot;Sardanapolis&quot;, &quot;Solomon&quot;, &quot;Orestes&quot;, &quot;Canidia&quot;, and &quot;Shakespeare&quot;. His &quot;Saul&quot; was completed in Rome in 1865, and taken to England by Noel Wills who displayed it at Rendcomb College. It is now in the collection of North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh. His &quot;Sibyl&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; were exhibited at the 1863 Universal Exposition in London.

In the 1870s, Story submitted a design for the Washington Monument, then under a prolonged and troubled construction. Although the Washington National Monument Society considered his proposals &quot;vastly superior in artistic taste and beauty&quot; to the original 1836 design by Robert Mills, they were not adopted, and the monument was completed to Mills&#x27; scheme, only slightly modified. Story also sculpted a bronze statue of Joseph Henry on the Mall in Washington, D.C., the scientist who served as the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s first Secretary. His works &quot;Libyan Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; are on display at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, GA.

Story died at Vallombrosa Abbey, Italy, a place he was sentimentally attached to and which he chronicled in an informal travel journal, &quot;Vallombrosa&quot; in 1881. He is buried with his wife, Emelyn Story, in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome, under a statue of his own design, &quot;Angel of Grief&quot;.

A 1903 posthumous biography of Story (and his circle), entitled &quot;William Wetmore Story and His Friends&quot;, was penned by Henry James.

===Family===
His children also pursued artistic careers: Thomas Waldo Story (1854–1915) became a sculptor; Julian Russell Story (1857–1919) was a successful portrait painter; and Edith Marion (1844–1907), the Marchesa Peruzzi de&#x27; Medici, became a writer.

<text>Baron Egerton, of Tatton in the County Palatine of Chester, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 15 April 1859 for William Egerton (1806–1883), a politician from the Egerton family.

==History==
William Egerton (1806–1883) had earlier represented Lymington and Cheshire North in the House of Commons. His branch of the Egerton family is descended in the female line from Thomas Egerton, of Tatton Park in Cheshire, youngest son of John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgewater. Thomas Egerton&#x27;s granddaughter Hester Egerton (died 1780) married William Tatton. In 1780 they assumed by Royal licence the surname of Egerton in lieu of Tatton. Their son William Tatton Egerton sat as Member of Parliament for Chester. His son Wilbraham Egerton also represented this constituency in the House of Commons. He was the father of William Egerton, who was elevated to the peerage in 1859.

The 1st Baron Egerton died in 1883 and was succeeded by his eldest son Wilbraham. The 2nd Baron Egerton was Member of Parliament for Cheshire North and Cheshire Mid and served as Chairman of the Manchester Ship Canal. On 22 July 1897 he was created Viscount Salford, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, and Earl Egerton, of Tatton in the County Chester. Both titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The 1st Earl Egerton had one daughter but no sons and on his death in 1909 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct.

He was succeeded in the barony by his younger brother, the 3rd Baron Egerton. He had previously represented Cheshire Mid and Knutsford in Parliament. When he died, the titles passed to his son, Maurice Egerton, the 4th Baron. On his death in 1958 the barony became extinct, and Tatton Park was given to the National Trust.

Edward Christopher Egerton, younger brother of the first Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Cheshire East. His grandson Henry Jack Egerton was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy.

<text>Curtis Northrup Strange (born January 30, 1955) is an American professional golfer and TV color commentator. He is the winner of consecutive U.S. Open titles and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame and Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. He spent over 200 weeks in the top-10 of the Official World Golf Ranking between their debut in 1986 and 1990.

==Amateur career==
Strange and his identical twin brother, Allan, were born in Norfolk, Virginia. His father, a local country club owner, started him in golf at age 7. Strange graduated from Princess Anne High School in Virginia Beach, then enrolled at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He played golf for the Demon Deacons and was part of the NCAA Championship team with Jay Haas and Bob Byman that &quot;Golf World&quot; has labeled &quot;the greatest of all time&quot;. In 1974 Strange was ranked the #2 amateur in the country by &quot;Golf Digest&quot;. The following year, he was ranked number #3.

In the spring of 1976, Strange intended to transition from amateur to professional despite still being a junior in college. At this point, he was known for having one of the best amateur careers of all time. According to the golf columnist for &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, Richard Sink, &quot;Strange, only a junior, will leave behind a collegiate record perhaps unmatched.&quot; He finished in the top ten in all of his 25 college matches and finished in the top 5 in 21 of those. He won nine individual events and was the youngest NCAA Champion in golf at the time. In 1976, he was ranked #9 amateur in the country by &quot;Golf Digest&quot;.

==Professional career==
Strange was one of the leading players on the PGA Tour in the 1980s; 16 of his 17 tour victories took place in that decade. He topped the money list in 1985, 1987, and 1988, when he became the first to win a million dollars in official money in a season. His two majors were consecutive U.S. Opens in 1988 and 1989. Since World War II, only three golfers have successfully defended their titles at the U.S. Open; Brooks Koepka in 2018, Strange in 1989, and Ben Hogan in 1951. The 1989 U.S. Open was Strange&#x27;s last win on tour. In other majors, he led midway through the final round at The Masters in 1985, but finished two strokes back. Strange was also a runner-up at the PGA Championship in 1989, one stroke back. He played on five Ryder Cup teams (1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, and 1995) and captained the team in 2002.

Despite skipping the Open Championship several times in his prime, Strange played a considerable amount of international tournaments. He won the 1986 ABC Japan-U.S. Match, an event on the Japan Golf Tour that included many American pros. He also played extensively on the Australasian Tour. He won three events in Australia in the late 1980s and early 1990s and recorded runner-up finishes at the 1976 Australian Open, 1977 Colgate Champion of Champions, 1986 Air New Zealand Shell Open, and the 1990 Daikyo Palm Meadows Cup. Like Henrik Stenson and Ben Hogan, Strange was a natural left-hander who played right-handed.

==Later career and honors==
After reaching the age of 50 in January 2005, Strange began play on the Champions Tour, remarking, &quot;I was getting worse and said, &#x27;To hell with it.&#x27;&quot; His only top-five finishes came that first season; third place at the Constellation Energy Classic and a tie for fifth at the FedEx Kinko&#x27;s Classic. In 1997, he was hired as the lead golf analyst for ESPN/ABC, working alongside host Mike Tirico. He left due to a contract dispute before the 2004 U.S. Open, but rejoined ESPN/ABC at the 2008 U.S. Open, four years after he first left. In 2016, he was hired by Fox as a course reporter for their USGA championships.

In this capacity he has provided commentary for several notable events, including Tiger Woods&#x27; playoff win at the 1997 Mercedes Championships, David Duval&#x27;s final round of 59 at the 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Jean van de Velde&#x27;s collapse at the 1999 Open Championship, Woods achieving the career grand slam at the 2000 Open Championship, Peter Jacobsen becoming one of the oldest Tour winners at age 49 during the 2003 Greater Hartford Open, Woods&#x27; U.S. Open winning performance in 2008 (early rounds), Tom Watson nearly winning The Open Championship at age 59 in 2009, and Phil Mickelson&#x27;s final nine charge to win in 2013. On April 18, 2007, Strange was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame, and was inducted on November 12 at the World Golf Village in St. Augustine, Florida. In May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia.

<text>Edward L. Stratemeyer (; October 4, 1862 – May 10, 1930) was an American publisher, writer of children&#x27;s fiction and founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate. He is one of the most prolific writers in the world, having penned over 1,300 books and selling more than 500 million copies.

Stratemeyer created many well-known children&#x27;s fiction book series, including The Rover Boys, The Bobbsey Twins, Tom Swift, The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, many of which sold millions of copies and remain in publication. On his legacy, &quot;Fortune&quot; wrote: &quot;As oil had its Rockefeller, literature had its Stratemeyer.&quot;

==Early life==
Stratemeyer was born the youngest of six children in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to Henry Julius Stratemeyer, a tobacconist, and Anna Siegel. They were both from Hanover, Germany, immigrating to the United States in 1837. The siblings were educated in English and spoke it to each other.

Growing up, Stratemeyer read the works of Horatio Alger and William T. Adams, writers who penned rags-to-riches tales of the hardworking young American, which greatly influenced him.

As a teenager, Stratemeyer operated his own printing press in the basement of his father&#x27;s tobacco shop, distributing flyers and pamphlets among his friends and family. These included stories called &quot;The Newsboy&#x27;s Adventure&quot; and &quot;The Tale of a Lumberman&quot;. After he graduated from high school, he went to work in his father&#x27;s store. At the age of 26, he sold his first story, &quot;Victor Horton&#x27;s Idea&quot;, to the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Golden Days&quot; for $76, over six times the average 1888 weekly paycheck.

==Career==
Stratemeyer moved to Newark, New Jersey, in 1890 and opened a paper store. He ran his shop while continuing to write stories under pseudonyms. He was able to write for many genres including detective dime novels, westerns and serials that ran in newspapers.

In 1893, Stratemeyer hired the popular dime-novel writer Gilbert Patten, according to Patten&#x27;s own autobiography, &quot;Frank Merriwell&#x27;s &#x27;Father&#x27;: An Autobiography by Gilbert Patten (Burt L. Standish)&quot; (University of Oklahoma Press, 1964). Patten writes that he did not like Stratemeyer. (A less-reliable source says that Stratemeyer was hired by Patten to write as an editor for the Street &amp; Smith publication &quot;Good News&quot;.)

In 1894, he published his first full-length book, &quot;Richard Dare&#x27;s Venture&quot;, which was the first in his &quot;Bound to Succeed&quot; series. It contained autobiographical content and was similar to Alger&#x27;s rags-to-riches story formula.

In 1899, Horatio Alger wrote Stratemeyer as editor of the &quot;Good News&quot;, asking him to finish one of his manuscripts. Alger was in poor health at the time. When Alger died later the same year, Stratemeyer continued to edit and finish several of Alger&#x27;s other books. That same year, after Alger died, Stratemeyer wrote and published &quot;The Rover Boys&quot;, which became a tremendously popular series in the vein of the classic dime novel. &quot;The Rover Boys&quot; was described as &quot;The first highly successful series by Edward Stratemeyer; each volume had a preface from Edward Stratemeyer himself, thanking his readers and touting the other books. It&#x27;s generally accepted that Stratemeyer wrote all of the books.&quot; He said this series was his personal favorite.

Stratemeyer formed the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1905 and hired journalists to write stories based on his ideas. He paid them a flat rate for each book and kept the copyrights to the novels.

== Personal life ==
Stratemeyer married Magdalena Van Camp, the daughter of a Newark businessman, on March 25, 1891. The couple had two daughters: Harriet Stratemeyer Adams (1892–1982) and Edna C. Squier (1895–1974), both of whom would later take over the future Stratemeyer Syndicate.

Stratemeyer enjoyed the outdoors and often took annual summer trips to the Great Lakes, Lake George and Lake Champlain with his family. They traveled as far as the west coast and Yosemite. A humble man, he never sought public attention and preferred living a private and quiet life with his family at their home on N. 7th Street in the Roseville section of Newark. His relationships with his daughters were warm and Harriet recalled a lively atmosphere growing up.

Stratemeyer was a member of the Roseville Athletic Club and the New Jersey Historical Association.

Stratemeyer died at age 67 in Newark, New Jersey on May 10, 1930, of lobar pneumonia and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Hillside, New Jersey. On May 12, 1930, two days after his death, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that his &quot;Rover Boys&quot; series &quot;had sales exceeding 5,000,000 copies&quot;.

==Accomplishments==
Stratemeyer pioneered the book-packaging technique of producing a consistent, long-running series of books using a team of freelance writers. All of the books in the series used the same characters in similar situations. All of the freelance writers, including Mildred Benson, who developed the character of Nancy Drew, were published under a pen name owned by his company.

Through his Stratemeyer Syndicate, founded in 1906, Stratemeyer employed a massive number of editors, copy writers, stenographers, cowriters and secretaries. They greatly contributed to a new genre of juvenile fiction and helped launch several series, including
* (1899) &quot;The Rover Boys&quot;
* (1904) &quot;The Bobbsey Twins&quot;
* (1905) &quot;Dave Porter&quot;
* (1910) &quot;Tom Swift&quot;
* (1912) &quot;Baseball Joe&quot;
* (1927) &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;
* (1930) &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;
* (1934) &quot;The Dana Girls&quot;

==Fictional depictions==
Edward Stratemeyer appears in the television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;. In the series, Stratemeyer is the father of the fictional Nancy Stratemeyer, who dates Indiana Jones in high school. Indiana is a fan of Tom Swift and gives Stratemeyer advice for one of his stories.

<doc id="803094" wikidata="Q7770375" url="?curid=803094" title="The Trouble with Tracy">
<text>The Trouble with Tracy is a Canadian television series produced by CTV for the 1970–1971 television season, with intended distribution by the U.S.-based National General Pictures. The series was based on scripts from the American radio comedy &quot;Easy Aces&quot; (1930–1945), written by Goodman Ace.&quot;&quot; It is considered by some to be one of the worst situation comedies ever produced.

The series was produced as a daily show and aired on weekday afternoons at 3:30 pm, beginning September 14, 1970. 

130 episodes—seven episodes filmed every five days—were produced. The series was notable for its low production values. Errors, including flubbed lines and bloopers, often appeared in the final broadcasts due to the lack of budget for retakes. The series used a laugh track instead of a live studio audience.

==Production==

&quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot; was filmed in Toronto at the studios of CFTO-TV. The series was set in New York City and centered on a newlywed couple, Tracy Sherwood Young (Diane Nyland) and Doug Young (Steve Weston). Tracy, portrayed as cheerful and prone to malapropisms, often wore mini-skirts and was portrayed as naive and literal-minded. Doug was an advertising executive who frequently found himself exasperated by Tracy’s well-intentioned but often problematic attempts to be helpful.

Episodes typically took place in the Youngs&#x27; apartment or Doug&#x27;s workplace, often narrated by Doug. The storylines usually revolved around the complications caused by Tracy’s behavior, which affected Doug at home, work, or in social settings. Despite these challenges, the couple always reconciled by the end of each episode.

Other regular characters included:

*Paul Sherwood (Franz Russell) - Tracy&#x27;s hippie brother, known for his schemes to make money, often involving Tracy, and for frequently borrowing from Doug. 
*Mrs. Sherwood (Sylvia Lennick) - Tracy&#x27;s critical mother.
*Tony Marshall (Arch McDonnell) - The Youngs&#x27; friendly neighbor and a writer.
*Mr. Jonathan Norris (Ben Lennick) - Doug&#x27;s demanding boss.
*Sally Anderson (Bonnie Brooks) - Tracy&#x27;s ditsy cousin and Doug&#x27;s often irritating secretary.

Initially, the show&#x27;s pilot was titled The Married Youngs as a wordplay on &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot;, referencing the couple&#x27;s surname. The title was later changed to &quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot; by producer Seymour Berns, inspired by his daughter, Tracy.

The show aired Monday to Friday, producing 130 episodes during its original run. These episodes were later rerun in afternoon time slots well into the 1970s.

==Context==

&quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot; is often considered to have been produced solely to fulfill the requirements of the Canadian content regulations. Cultural critics, including Geoff Pevere, have noted that despite its lack of success, the series represents one of the early attempts to produce a scripted television program within the financial limitations of Canadian television production at the time.

At the time of the series’ production, American television networks had the financial resources and diverse programming portfolios to absorb losses by canceling underperforming shows early. CTV, facing financial challenges and limited national reach compared to CBC Television, was compelled to air the full series to recover its investment. The network had only recently emerged from near-bankruptcy in 1965 and operated as a cooperative of its affiliated stations. This structure required network programming to be funded and produced by individual stations, akin to models seen in PBS in the United States or ITV in the United Kingdom, rather than the centralized approach of modern commercial networks. 

==Ongoing influence in Canadian popular culture==
In his book &quot;TV North: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Canadian Television&quot;, Peter Kenter described &quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot; as &quot;universally considered the worst Canadian TV show of all time, especially by those who have never seen it.&quot; Despite its reputation, the show gained a cult following, particularly among viewers who discovered it as teenagers, with reruns continuing into the 1990s. These reruns often aired in early morning time slots, such as before &quot;Canada AM&quot;, as a cost-effective way to fill broadcast schedules.

The Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies featured a song called &quot;The Trouble With Tracy&quot; on one of their early demo tapes in 1988. Apart from the title, the song had no connection to the television show.

In March 2003, The Comedy Network announced plans to air a pilot for a new version of &quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot;, based on the original scripts. The pilot, scheduled for April 1, 2003, was intended to lead to a 13-episode series starring Laurie Elliott as Tracy and David Lipovitch as Doug. A press conference was held, during which Elliott, Lipovitch, and Diane Nyland participated in interviews and other promotional activities.

The entire campaign was revealed to be an April Fools&#x27; Day prank. The &quot;pilot&quot; consisted only of a brief introduction leading into an episode of &quot;The Gavin Crawford Show&quot;. The prank caught some media outlets by surprise, including the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;Canada AM&quot;, which had reported on the revival plans as if they were genuine.

<text>Fernand Baldet (16 March 1885 – 8 November 1964) was a French astronomer.

He worked with Count Aymar de la Baume Pluvinel observing Mars from the newly built observatory on Pic du Midi in 1909. The resulting photographs, taken with the 0.5 metre (20 inch) reflecting Baillaud telescope, were so sharp that they were able to disprove Percival Lowell&#x27;s claim of geometrical canals on the planet&#x27;s surface.

Baldet was the president of the Société astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1939 to 1945. In 1946, Baldet and Charles Maurain jointly received the Prix Jules Janssen, the society&#x27;s highest award.

The crater Baldet on the Moon and the crater Baldet on Mars were named in his honour.

Baldet was French pioneer of color photography working in Autochrome Lumière, Kodachrome and Agfacolor before the Second World War.

<text>The Earl of Fife or Mormaer of Fife was the ruler of the province of Fife in medieval Scotland, which encompassed the modern counties of Fife and Kinross. Due to their royal ancestry, the earls of Fife were the highest ranking nobles in the realm, and had the right to crown the king of Scots.

Held by the MacDuff family until it passed by resignation to the Stewarts, the earldom ended on the forfeiture and execution of Murdoch Stewart in 1425. The earldom was revived in 1759 with the style of Earl Fife for William Duff, a descendant of the MacDuffs. His great-great-grandson, the 6th Earl Fife, was made Earl of Fife in 1885 and Duke of Fife in 1889.

==Medieval earldom==
===Mormaer of Fife===
The mormaers of Fife, by the 12th century, had established themselves as the highest ranking native nobles in Scotland. They frequently held the office of Justiciar of Scotia - highest brithem in the land - and enjoyed the right of crowning the kings of the Scots. The Mormaer&#x27;s function, as with other medieval Scottish lordships, was partly kin-based. Hence, in 1385, the Earl of Fife, seen as the successor of the same lordship, is called &quot;capitalis legis de Clenmcduffe&quot; (&quot;Lord of the Law of the Children of Macduff&quot;).

The first earl was Alexander Scrymgeour (died 1306). Alexander served under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. He was the official and hereditary banner bearer for the king and was awarded title of earl and the demesne of Fife for services rendered. The lordship existed in the Middle Ages until its last earl, Murdoch (&quot;Muireadhach&quot;), Duke of Albany, was executed by James I of Scotland.

=== Chief of Clan Macduff===
The deputy or complementary position to mormaer or earl of Fife was leadership as Chief (&quot;ceann&quot;) of Clan MacDuff (&quot;clann meic Duibh&quot;). There is little doubt that the style MacDuib, or Macduff, derives from the name of King Cináed III mac Duib, and ultimately from this man&#x27;s father, King Dub (d. 966). Compare, for instance, that Domhnall, Lord of the Isles, signed a charter in 1408 as &quot;MacDomhnaill&quot;. The descendants of Cináed III adopted the name in the same way that the descendants of Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig called themselves &quot;Uí Briain&quot;, although it does seem that at least initially &quot;MacDuff&quot; was a style reserved for the man who held the Mormaership of Fife.

The chieftaincy of the clan was not always held by the mormaer, especially after the mormaerdom became subject to the laws of feudal primogeniture in the reign of Donnchadh I. For example, at the Battle of Falkirk, it is the head of the clan who led the men of Fife, rather than the Mormaer.

===End of Macduff line===
The Macduff line continued without interruption until the time of Isabella, the only child of Donnchad (Duncan) IV, Earl of Fife, and his wife Mary de Monthermer. She succeeded her father as &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Fife on his death in 1358, making her one of the most eligible maidens in Scotland. She married four times, but all her husbands died within a few years of their marriage. In 1371 she was persuaded to name Robert Stewart, Earl of Menteith (later Duke of Albany) as her heir, who was her brother-in-law by her second marriage to Walter Stewart. He thus succeeded her as twelfth Earl of Fife on her death in 1389. Duke Robert was succeeded as Duke of Albany, Earl of Fife, etc. by his son Murdoch in 1420. Duke Murdoch was forfeited and executed in 1425, due to his father&#x27;s part in the death of Prince David, Duke of Rothesay. Thus the earldom of Fife came to an end.

==Coat of arms==

The arms of the earldom of Fife are &quot;or, a lion rampant gules,&quot; that is, a red lion rampant on gold. These arms are testament to the earls&#x27; royal connection, as they differ from the king&#x27;s arms only in the exclusion of the flowered border, or royal tressure; in fact it is possible that the royal arms are actually a differenced version of those of the earl. The device of a lion is attested for the first time on the seal of the tenth earl, but had probably been used for a long time before this, though some early seals show a different shield, bearing pallets, or vertical stripes.

The arms of the earl of Fife are the basis for the arms of Fife Council, which show a knight on horseback in full armorial regalia, his shield, helm and the caparison of his horse bedecked with red lions. The Fife lion also appears in the first quarter of the duke of Fife&#x27;s arms.

==Earls Fife (1759)==

The earldom of Fife was resurrected in 1759 for William Duff, after he proved his descent from the original earls of Fife. This title was in the Peerage of Ireland, notwithstanding that Fife is in Scotland; the &quot;of&quot; was also excluded, as was &quot;not unfrequently&quot; the case in the Irish Peerage.

==Earls of Fife (1885)==

The title of Earl of Fife in the peerage of the United Kingdom was created in 1885 by Queen Victoria for Alexander Duff, 6th Earl Fife (1849–1912).

In 1889, Duff married Queen Victoria&#x27;s granddaughter Princess Louise. Queen Victoria elevated him to the dignity of Duke of Fife in the peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1900, Queen Victoria created a second dukedom of Fife for him which could pass to his daughters and their heirs male. After his death in 1912, the dukedom of Fife created in 1900 passed to his eldest daughter, Princess Alexandra, while his other titles, including the 1885 earldom of Fife and the 1889 dukedom of Fife, became extinct.

<text>The &#x27; (DVP, German for &quot;German People&#x27;s Police&quot;), commonly known as the &#x27; or VoPo, was the national uniformed police force of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) from 1945 to 1990. The Volkspolizei was a highly-centralized agency responsible for most civilian law enforcement in East Germany, maintaining 257,500 personnel at its peak. It worked closely along with the Stasi to maintain public order and identify threats to the regime.

== History ==

The was effectively founded in June 1945 when the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SVAG) established central police forces in the regions of Nazi Germany it occupied following after World War II.

The SVAG approved the arming of community-level police forces on 31 October 1945, but remained a non-militarised force, and by 1946 the comprised some 22,000 personnel. The police force experienced several challenges at this time: the proportion of non-trained personnel between 65 and 95% undermined its professionalism and turnover rates of personnel were initially as high as 50%, affecting the stability of the workforce. By 1948, membership had increased to approximately 65,000, but there were still issues of political unreliability and insufficient professional aptitude, which prompted a purge of 10,000 from the force in 1949; as a consequence, 86% of its membership were now members of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany. 

It was formally referred to as the (&quot;German People&#x27;s Police&quot;) from May 1949 onward, three months before the GDR&#x27;s founding.

It was dissolved during German reunification in 1990, and was superseded by the Bundespolizei of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Landespolizei of the reconstituted states of Saxony, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and Berlin.

== Organization ==
=== Main administration ===
With the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Volkspolizei was subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior. The Volkspolizei was divided into various individual branches and specialised forces:
* Criminal Investigation Department ()
* Railway Police Department ()
* Registration Department ()
* Traffic Police Department ()
* Uniformed Police Department ()
* Fire Department ()

In addition to these units, the Volkspolizei also comprised the paramilitary Kasernierte Volkspolizei (KVP, people&#x27;s police in barracks, similar to MVD Internal Troops), from which the National People&#x27;s Army (NVA) was formed in 1956.

== Function and effectiveness ==
The function of the Volkspolzei changed over time. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Volkspolizei can be regarded as the nucleus of all other armed state institutions of the GDR. It was the first institution of the East German state, from which other organisations such as the Stasi and the National People&#x27;s Army originated, both at the institutional and personnel level. Over time, however, it increasingly became but one agency within the GDR&#x27;s extensive security bureaucracy.

In terms of general policing duties, the Volkspolizei dealt with criminal activity as conventionally understood, such as theft, murder, and so on, but also performed duties including border protection, passport and identity controls, transport control, and the protection of sensitive buildings and areas, each of which were carried out by specialised departments. A critical part of the Volkspolizei was its grass-roots policing, introduced from 1952, whereby every GDR citizen had their own &quot;section commissioner&quot; (, ABV). Within their section, the ABV was responsible for all policing affairs regardless of branch or speciality in that area; in total, approximately 5,000 ABV positions were created all over the republic in order to cover an average of 4,000 inhabitants per section. Following the East German uprising of 1953, the number of sections and ABVs almost doubled. The purpose of the ABV was to establish and cultivate a &quot;close connection&quot; with their section&#x27;s population, in order to fulfil conventional policing duties, as well as enable the party to penetrate society at the very moment of the construction of socialism through state power.

Police functions were also extended beyond the official, paid forces through organisations such as Combat Groups of the Working Class (, KdA), organised units within factories and workplaces numbering around 400,000.

The effectiveness of the Volkspolizei was questioned following the Uprising of 1953. The leaders of the SED and the Volkspolizei interpreted the response by the GDR&#x27;s security apparatus as a debacle. Police stations and court houses were attacked, and throughout the disturbances sections of the Volkspolizei were effectively paralysed, with some personnel even joining the protesters. A central party report on 18 June 1953 concluded that: &quot;A stop must be put to the general phenomenon on 17 June, that people merely observed, withdrew, or allowed themselves to be ignored or disarmed.&quot; This failure by Volkspolizei personnel to engage in the confrontation was another serious concern.

In response to the failings of the police response greater coordination between the Stasi, the Volkspolizei and the National People&#x27;s Army was implemented. All three organisations cooperated under the local, regional, and central leaderships of the party, under the overall control of the National Defence Council. The failure by different agencies to cooperate was believed to have been partly responsible for the escalation of the June Uprising. In response, therefore, more effective coordination was instituted to ensure the rapid suppression of potential unrest and in moments of crisis, such as during August 1961 and August 1968. The efficiency of these forces and the close cooperation between state and party organs was a key factor in maintaining the outward semblance of stability from 1953 to 1989.

== Membership ==
=== Recruitment and training ===
Recruitment to the Volkspolizei required at least ten years of education, vocational training (see education in East Germany), military service, and a history of political loyalty.

Upon joining, a recruit would take a five-month course at the Police Academy (). The schedule contained political education, police law, criminal law and procedures, and military-style fitness training. Afterwards the recruit completed a 6-month practical internship.

The reasons Volkspolizei officers gave for joining the force were a desire to work with people, idealism, family tradition, belief in the system and the wish to serve one&#x27;s country.

From 1962, the Volkspolizei had its own school in Berlin-Biesdorf which trained around 3,500 officers up to 1989. There were several other schools. The (barracks units) had their own training facilities. Officers were initially trained in the army ground forces, from 1963 at the Officers&#x27; school and from 1971 to the officers&#x27; school in Dresden-Wilder Mann:

* - College of MdI &quot;Heinrich Rau&quot;, Radebeul
* - College of the MdI, &quot;Wilhelm Pieck&quot;, Aschersleben
* — University of the VP, Berlin-Biesdorf (Cecilienstraße)
* — Humboldt University Berlin / Criminalistics Section
* , Dresden (Officer school for standby units, &quot;Artur Becker&quot;, Dresden (now the headquarters of the State Criminal Office Saxony)
* (school for the section represented), Wolfen
* (School of Communication), Dommitzsch
* — Special School for service dogs, Pretzsch (Elbe)
* - Special School of medical services (in the district of Magdeburg)
* (Transport Police School), Halle (Saale)
* (Traffic Police School), Magdeburg
* , Neustrelitz (since 1984 central service similar school)

The Volkspolizei had approximately 80,000 full-time police officers and 177,500 volunteers.

With the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, authority over the police went to the newly created federal jurisdiction. About forty percent of the Volkspolizei employees had to leave the service.

=== Oath ===
The official oath that all Volkspolizei officers swore was:

=== Uniforms ===
With the exception of the , whose grey-green uniforms follow the style of the East German National People’s Army ( - NVA), all services wore the same basic uniform adopted in 1956 when it was officially established. There were various kinds of uniforms, worn according to the work or social situation and differing in material for summer or winter wear. Most uniforms — service, semi-dress, and parade — are gray-green but the transport police wore dark blue. The better quality and texture of the cloth in officers&#x27; uniforms distinguished them from the uniforms of enlisted personnel. The field and service uniforms became normal attire in garrison and for most other duty activities.

The basic categories of uniforms were field, service, semi-dress, and parade.

Field uniforms () were for only the . The field uniform consisted of the NVA&#x27;s service uniform. The uniform was worn with a field cap, service cap, or steel helmet; high black boots; and a leather belt with vertical web shoulder suspenders. In the winter, a quilted stone-grey padded suit without a camouflage pattern is worn over the service uniform. The winter uniform also includes a fur pile cap or a steel helmet, boots, knitted grey gloves, belt, and suspenders.

The service uniform () was a summer service uniform for officers with a bloused jacket, worn without a shirt, trousers, and a visored service cap, worn by all Volkspolizei members except for the , along with the . The winter service uniform version featured a jacket that had four large patch pockets with button-down tabs, worn with a black belt, the service cap, breeches, shirt, tie, belt, and high boots are provided for officers and NCOs. Enlisted and NCO caps had green piping, but Officer caps had silver piping for junior to mid-level officers and gold piping for senior officers. For winter, a long, heavy, belted overcoat was worn.

The semi-dress uniform (), except in details, was the same for all ranks and was worn on off-duty or off-post occasions. It included the service cap, jacket, long trousers, and black low-quarter shoes. The single-breasted jacket was worn without a belt, with a white or grey-green shirt and a green tie. Officers were allowed to wear the jacket with a white shirt. During periods of warm summer weather, either the shirt and tie or the jacket may be omitted. For a while a double-breasted jacket could be worn as optional wear by officers and warrant officers.

The parade uniform () for officers was the semi-dress jacket worn with all awards and decorations, breeches and riding boots, steel helmet or police shako () from 1950 to the late 1960s, white shirt, green neck-tie, and a ceremonial dagger on the left side, fastened to a silver-grey parade belt. Officers in guards of honour carry sabres. In winter, overcoat, scarf, and gloves were worn.

The type of work uniform () worn was governed by seasonal considerations and weather. Generally, reconditioned items of service clothing; field, semi-dress and winter padded uniforms; some dyed black, were issued for all types of fatigue and maintenance details. Coveralls are also used by the lower ranks, especially heavy vehicle and flying personnel. Officers in technical branches supervising fatigue details wear a laboratory-style smock.

Other types of uniforms existed. High-ranking officers occasionally wore white uniforms, or at least a white jacket similar to those worn by Generals in the National People&#x27;s Army, and staff officers were supplied with staff service uniforms. Women had their own uniforms consisting of jackets, skirts or slacks, blouses, caps, boots or pumps, and other appropriate items in accordance with the season and the occasion. Traffic police, motorcyclists, armoured vehicle personnel, and others have special items of apparel.

Volkspolizei uniform initially had green , but later reverted to white except for the transport police who wore blue. The uniform of the Kasernierte Volkspolizei is distinguished from that of the NVA ground force and Air Defence Force by a green armband with large silver letters identifying the wearer&#x27;s affiliation.

<text>Earl Sondes, of Lees Court in the County of Kent, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1880 for the former Conservative Member of Parliament for East Kent, George Milles, 5th Baron Sondes. He was made Viscount Throwley, of the County of Kent, at the same time, which title was used as a courtesy title by the eldest son and heir apparent of the Earl.
The title of Baron Sondes, of Lees Court in the County of Kent, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1760 for Lewis Watson. Born the Hon. Lewis Monson, he was the second son of John Monson, 1st Baron Monson, and his wife Lady Margaret Watson, youngest daughter of Lewis Watson, 1st Earl of Rockingham (see these titles for earlier history of the families). In 1746 he assumed the surname of Watson on succeeding to the estates of his cousin, Thomas Watson, 3rd Earl of Rockingham (who was also Viscount Sondes). His son, the second Baron, represented Hedon in the House of Commons. His younger son, the fourth Baron, who succeeded his brother in 1836, assumed in 1820 by Royal licence the surname of Milles only. On his death the title passed to his son, the aforementioned fifth Baron, who was created Earl Sondes in 1880.

The sister of the 4th Earl Sondes, Lady Isobel Milles-Lade (d.1990), was married to the 18th Earl of Derby, of Knowsley Hall, Lancashire.

The family seat of the Earls Sondes was Lees Court, in the village of Sheldwich, three miles south of Faversham. The Lees Court Estate is today owned by the Countess Sondes, widow of the 5th and last Earl Sondes. Lees Court itself was entirely destroyed by fire in November 1910, but was carefully rebuilt and is now subdivided into private apartments. The Estate during the early 1900s was 85,000 acres. Today the Estate is 7,000 acres which includes the Swale Estuary and the Faversham and Oare Creeks.

<text>The Kavalan (endonym ; &quot;people living in the plain&quot;; ) or Kuvalan are an indigenous people of Taiwan. Most of them moved to the coastal area of Hualien County and Taitung County in the 19th century due to encroachment by Han settlers. Their language is also known as Kavalan. Currently, the largest settlement of Kavalan is Xinshe (Kavalan: ) Village in Fengbin Township, Hualien County.

==History==

Legend has it that the Kavalan arrived by sea from the east and that when they saw the stunning beauty of this location, they decided then and there to settle this bountiful land. The newly arrived Kavalan fought many battles against the local Atayal people, and in the end the Kavalan drove the Atayal into the mountains—true to their name &quot;Kavalan&quot;, which means &quot;flatland people&quot;. That name subsequently morphed into &quot;Hamalan&quot;, ultimately yielding the modern-day Yilan City. They were referred as 36 Kavalan tribes (蛤仔難三十六社), although there were more than 60. In the past, tribes north of the Lanyang River were called Sai-sè-hoan (西勢番) while those south of the river were Tang-sè-hoan (東勢番).

The earliest record of the Kavalan in history was in 1632, when a Spanish ship went astray to this area by a typhoon. More clear record came in 1650 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Reportedly, at some point there was a Spanish province of in the area. Han Chinese tried to settle in the area as early as 1768. However, settlement did not succeed until 1796, when established the first village (now Toucheng). Eventually, many more Han Chinese entered this area and the life of Kavalan was forced to change. Many of them moved to Beipu Village (in Sincheng Township of Hualien County) between 1830 and 1840.

== Culture ==

=== Clothing ===
In the past, Kavalan&#x27;s men sometimes opted for shorter garments or exposing their chests and backs. The Han Chinese influence brought about the introduction of cotton clothing in the Han style.

Kavalan people wear traditional clothes only during important traditional performances and ritual practices. These traditional attires of the Kavalan community are unisex and are characterized by simplicity, typically featuring only one or two colors, predominantly black or white, and lack elaborate dyeing and colorful geometric patterns. The upper garments are practically identical for both men and women. The white shirt has a round neck, long sleeves, and a row of Chinese-style buttons in the middle, adorned with black cloth on the front. The lower garment usually consists of a skirt, commonly in black or white. Chiefs, elders, and shamans make an exception to this attire by wearing black pants and black shirt. 

A crucial element in the crafting of Kavalan clothing is banana fiber. The Kavalan people weave this fiber into hemp fabric, which is then used for creating traditional Kavalan attire, as well as daily necessities and accessories like belts, straw capes, and tote bags, often complementing their traditional clothing.

==Karewan incident==
In 1878, the Kavalan, and their Sakizaya allies, fought a devastating battle against Qing invaders after a dispute with Qing officials led to a local uprising. This event ended in disaster for both communities with many of their members slaughtered in the (also known as the &quot;Galeewan Incident&quot; or &quot;Kalyawan Battle&quot;). Others were displaced by Han settlers. The remaining Sakizaya, meanwhile, were forced to blend with other peoples, such as the Amis, with the intention of protecting their identity.

<doc id="803117" wikidata="Q723468" url="?curid=803117" title="Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo">
<text>Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo (; – 1505) was a Castilian author who arranged the modern version of the chivalric romance &quot;Amadís de Gaula&quot;, originally written in three books in the 14th century by an unknown author. Montalvo incorporated a fourth book in the original series, and followed it with a sequel, &quot;Las sergas de Esplandián&quot;. It is the sequel that Montalvo is most often noted for, mainly because within the book he coined the word &quot;California&quot;.

Montalvo is known to have been referred to by several other names, including; Garci Ordóñez de Montalvo, García Gutiérrez de Montalvo and García de Montalvo el Viejo.

==Biography==
Montalvo was born in Medina del Campo in the Province of Valladolid, Spain. He came from an influential family, belonging to the Pollino lineage, one of the seven who dominated Medina&#x27;s council policy. This lineage came from Martín Gutiérrez de Montalvo, VIII lord of Botalorno. At one time Montalvo had the title &quot;Alderman of Medina del Campo&quot; and was clerk of the land of the surrounding town. In 1482 he was part of a contingent sent from Medina del Campo to guard Alhama in the Province of Granada, which had recently been captured from the Moors.

Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo had three children: Pedro Vaca, Juan Vaca Montalvo and Francisco Vaca. His grandson García de Montalvo participated in the conquest of Venezuela and Peru around 1540 and was an informant for Fernández de Oviedo.

Records of a lawsuit held in the Chancery of Valladolid show that by 1505 Montalvo had died. Most of his works may have been published after his death.

==&quot;Las Sergas de Esplandián&quot;==
Montalvo spent many years translating and recasting the &quot;Amadis of Gaul&quot; novels and appending a fourth book of his own. He then wrote a sequel, &quot;Las sergas de Esplandián&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Esplandián&quot;), in which he tells the life and wandering of Amadis&#x27; eldest son. In the sequel Montalvo described a mythical Island of California as being west of the Indies:

The novel was highly influential in motivating Hernán Cortés and other explorers in the discovery of the &quot;island&quot;, which they believed lay along the west coast of North America. In 1539, Francisco de Ulloa, sailing under the commission of Cortés, explored the Gulf of California and the coast of Baja California peninsula, determining that it was a peninsula, not an island. Nevertheless, the cartographic misconception of California as an island persisted on many European maps well into the 18th century.

The saga was continued by books by later authors. The books were the sixth novel, &quot;Florisando&quot; (by Ruiz Paez de Ribera, 1510), followed by &quot;Lisuarte of Greece&quot; (by Feliciano de Silva, 1514), &quot;Lisuarte of Greece&quot; (by Juan Diaz, 1525), &quot;Amadis of Greece&quot; (by Feliciano de Silva, 1530), etc.

<text>National Normal University was a teacher&#x27;s college in Lebanon, Ohio. Located in southwestern Ohio, it opened in 1855 as Southwestern Normal School and took the name National Normal University in 1870. Alfred Holbrook was the first president and the school&#x27;s guiding force for most of its existence. He resigned in 1897 after 42 years. In 1907 the NNU became public and changed its name to Lebanon University.
The school went bankrupt in and finally closed in 1917. The school merged with Wilmington College in Wilmington, Ohio. The Warren County (Ohio) Historical Society in Lebanon, Ohio, now holds Lebanon University&#x27;s records.
In 1933 Alfred Holbrook College opened on the same campus. AHC moved to Manchester, Ohio where it closed in 1941. The original campus was demolished in 1977.

<text>Earl Sydney, of Scadbury in the County of Kent, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1874 for John Townshend, 3rd Viscount Sydney.

== Earl Sydney (1874) ==
The titles of Baron Sydney (third creation; 1783) and Viscount Sydney (second creation; 1789), were created in the Peerage of Great Britain, for the politician Thomas Townshend (1733–1800), known as Lord Sydney.

Townshend was then succeeded by his son, John Thomas Townshend, 2nd Viscount Sydney (1764–1831).

On his death, the titles passed to his son, the Liberal politician John Robert Townshend, 3rd Viscount Sydney (1805–1890), who was then elevated to the title of earl in 1874. Earl Sydney notably served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Lord Steward of the Household. On his death in 1890, however, in the absence of an heir, all his titles became extinct.

<doc id="803129" wikidata="Q951813" url="?curid=803129" title="Mazda Tribute">
<text>The (&quot;Code J14&quot;) is a compact SUV made by Japanese automaker Mazda from 2000 to 2011. It was jointly developed with Ford Motor Company and based on the front-wheel drive Mazda 626 platform, which was in turn the basis for the similar Ford Escape on the CD2 platform. The Tribute was priced below the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner in Ford&#x27;s CD2 SUV lineup.

The Tribute and Escape debuted in 2000, offering front- or all-wheel drive and a choice of a transversely mounted 2.0 L Ford Zetec 4-cylinder engine or 3.0 L Ford Duratec V6. The Ford Escape was also sold as the Ford Maverick in Europe with a Ford 2.0 L I4 Zeta engine with manual transmission, or 3.0 L Duratec coupled to automatic transmission.

One main difference between the Tribute and the Ford Escape/Maverick is that the Tribute&#x27;s suspension is tuned for a firmer ride than the Escape/Maverick, in order to correspond with Mazda&#x27;s sporty image. As Mazda had offered &quot;spiced up&quot; models in other segments such as the Mazda3 and CX-7, the utilitarian Tribute was replaced by the more aggressively styled and in-house-designed Mazda CX-5 in North America.


== First generation (EP; 2000) ==

=== 2000 ===
The Tribute made its debut at the 2000 Los Angeles Auto Show as a compact crossover SUV, a segment pioneered by the Toyota RAV4 in 1994. Its conservative styling resembled the Mazda Navajo, a rebadged two-door Ford Explorer which was retired in 1994. In Japan, Mazda had already been selling an SUV called the Mazda Proceed Levante, a rebadged Suzuki Escudo by 1995, but the Tribute was Mazda&#x27;s first original SUV. The Ford plant in Claycomo, Missouri assembled the Tribute for the North American market, alongside the Ford Escape. The Mazda plant in Hofu, Japan and the Ford Lio Ho plant in Taiwan also assembled the Tribute for their respective markets.
Japanese sales commenced in November 2001. The Japanese lineup was only available with a column-shifted four-speed automatic transmission. The lineup included the 2-liter LX with two- or four-wheel drive, and the four-wheel drive 3.0 V6 either as the LX or the well equipped GL-X. LX models were also available with a &quot;G package&quot;: this included aluminum wheels, side airbags, and tinted glass amongst other extras. In May 2001 a front-wheel drive V6 LX model was added, as was the option of an &quot;L package&quot; (with leather seats and more) on the GL-X version. In October 2001 the &quot;Field Break&quot; special edition was introduced; this leisure oriented model had seats with water-repellant fabric, a front pushbar, and other amenities aimed people with &quot;active&quot; lifestyles.

Engine options:
* 2.0 L YF I4, /183 N·m (135 lb·ft)
* 3.0 L AJ V6, /265 N·m (195 lb·ft)
The 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine had timing belt-driven Camshafts, while the 3.0 L Duratec V6 featured a maintenance-free timing chain.

=== 2004 facelift ===
Both the Escape and Tribute were refreshed in 2004 for the 2005 model year. In Japan, this change took place in December 2003. The base engine became the Mazda 2.3 L MZR inline-four, while the optional V6 remained the 3.0 L Duratec. In North American-built models, a floor-mounted automatic transmission shifter replaced the column shifter; However, Japanese-built models continued with a column shifter. The earlier DX, LX, and ES models were replaced with the Tribute i (four-cylinder) and Tribute s (V6). Also new was the availability of an automatic transmission coupled to the four-cylinder engine.

Japanese buyers only received a single V6-engined model, as the more powerful four-cylinder engine made the thirsty V6 somewhat superfluous. The V6 came only as a four-wheel drive &quot;Field Break&quot; model. The inline-four was available as an LX (also with front-wheel drive), FB-X, or Field Break. This lineup continued until Japanese sales ended in March 2006 and it was replaced with the similarly sized CX-7.

Engine options:
* 2.3 L L3 I4, /206 N·m (152 lb·ft)
* 3.0 L AJ V6, /261 N·m (193 lb·ft)

=== 2006 (Asia-Pacific) ===
A significantly facelifted version of the Tribute was released in the second half of 2006 for Asia Pacific markets. The updated Tribute featured a larger, bolder grille, with an enlarged Mazda emblem, as well as restyled front bumper and headlights. Side mirrors featured integrated indicators.

On the inside, changes included a new floor-mounted automatic transmission shifter, in place of the old column shifter (Asia-Pacific model only; US-built Tribute gained the floor shifter in 2005). The dashboard was updated with a new radio, and automatic electronic climate control on certain models. Mechanically, the rear drum brakes were replaced by disc brakes. Engines remain the same, but the V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%, while the 4-cylinder has improved mid-range torque and an electronic throttle. Both engines had been certified to meet Euro III emission regulations.

In 2008, Mazda Australia also discontinued the Tribute, its absence filled by the CX-7 introduced in the previous year. For other Asia-Pacific markets, production was shifted to the Ford Lio Ho plant in Jhongli, Taiwan, which also produces Tribute&#x27;s Ford Escape twin for Asia-Pacific markets. This arrangement continued until early 2010, when the Tribute for the Asia-Pacific markets ceased production, being fully replaced by the CX-7 imported from Japan.
== Second generation (2007) ==
In 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Tribute was significantly revamped, like its Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner siblings. Originally set to be renamed the &quot;Mazda CX-5&quot;, the vehicle kept the Tribute name. The changes were significant, but fell short of a &quot;clean sheet&quot; redesign, as the vehicles remained on the CD2 platform, and kept the existing 2.3 L L5-VE inline-four and 3.0 L AJ V6 engines. Visible changes included all new sheet metal and interior. The interior was significantly upgraded using all new components and higher quality materials, and was generally praised by automotive journalists. However, unlike the first generation of the Tribute, which had unique exterior and interior from its siblings, the new model only differs from its siblings in the &quot;nose&quot; (front fenders, hood, and front fascia), tail lights and detailing. Notable changes to the exterior include a higher belt line and more pronounced wheel arches. Overall the car was designed to look larger and more substantial than the previous model. As a cost-saving measure, rear drum brakes, replaced the previous discs, to criticism from the automotive press.

The 2008 Tribute (non-hybrid) was first unveiled at the 2007 Montreal International Auto Show and went on sale in March 2007.

A new addition was the Hybrid model which was previously only available on the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner.

The Tribute received additional major changes to improve performance for the 2009 model year, mostly by way of mechanical upgrades. Most significant were all new engines; Mazda&#x27;s new 2.5 L L5-VE I4 replaced the 2.3, boosting horsepower to and of torque at 4000 rpm. Despite increased horsepower, fuel economy also increased by on both urban and extra-urban cycles. The optional 3.0 L (AJ) V6 was updated, resulting in a increase, bringing output to and of torque. It also brought a 1 mpg improvement in fuel economy. 

Another significant change was the switch to Ford&#x27;s new 6F 6-speed automatic, which became standard on all V6 equipped models and optional on the four-cylinder versions. As well, new front and rear stabilizer bars were added for 2009 to improve ride handling after complaints about diminished performance following the 2008 changes. Others changes included redesigned seats, daytime running lamps, optional steering-mounted audio controls, and other additional features. The Tribute was discontinued at the end of the 2011 model year, replaced by the Mazda CX-5 in 2012.
== Sales ==

Within Australia, the Tribute was initially a popular choice of SUV, where it only trailed the likes of the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Nissan X-Trail, and the Subaru Forester. Whilst other territories around the world saw the Ford variant stand dominant, it was Mazda&#x27;s Tribute that was victorious in Australia by a factor of nearly 2 to 1.

<doc id="803132" wikidata="Q472773" url="?curid=803132" title="Four Evangelists">
<text>In Christian tradition, the Four Evangelists are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the authors attributed with the creation of the four canonical Gospel accounts. In the New Testament, they bear the following titles: the Gospel of Matthew; the Gospel of Mark; the Gospel of Luke; and the Gospel of John. 

==Gospels==


The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are known as the Synoptic Gospels, because they include many of the same stories, often in the same sequence or even verbatim. While the periods to which the gospels are usually dated suggest otherwise, convention traditionally holds that the authors were two of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, John and Matthew, as well as two &quot;apostolic men&quot;, Mark and Luke, whom Orthodox Tradition records as members of the 70 Apostles (Luke 10):
* Matthew – a former tax collector (Levi) who was called by Jesus to be one of the Twelve Apostles
* Mark – a follower of Peter and so an &quot;apostolic man&quot;
* Luke – a doctor who wrote what is now the book of Luke to Theophilus. Also known to have written the book of Acts (or Acts of the Apostles) and to have been a close friend of Paul of Tarsus
* John – a disciple of Jesus and the youngest of his Twelve Apostles

They are called evangelists, a word meaning &quot;people who proclaim good news&quot;, because their books aim to tell the &quot;good news&quot; (&quot;gospel&quot;) of Jesus.

==Symbols==
In iconography, the evangelists often appear in Evangelist portraits derived from classical tradition, and are also frequently represented by the symbols which originate from the four &quot;living creatures&quot; that draw the throne-chariot of God in the vision in Ezekiel 1 reflected in the Book of Revelation (ff), referred to as the four &#x27;Seraphim&#x27;, though neither source links the creatures to the Evangelists (of course the depiction of the Seraphim predates in chronology the writing of the New Testament which portrays the writers John, Luke, Mark, Matthew as symbolically embodied by the four Seraphim). Images normally, but not invariably, appear with wings like angels. When the symbols of the Four Evangelists appear together, it is called a Tetramorph, common in the Romanesque art of Europe such as church frescoes or murals.

The meanings accruing to the symbols grew over centuries, with an early formulation by Jerome, and were fully expressed by Rabanus Maurus, who set out three layers of meaning for the beasts: representing first the Evangelists, second the nature of Christ, and third the virtues required of a Christian for salvation. These animals may have originally been seen as representing the highest forms of the various types of animals: man, as king of creation, as the image of the creator; the lion, as king of beasts of prey (meat-eating); the ox, as king of domesticated animals (grass-eating); the eagle, as king of birds.

* Matthew the Evangelist, the author of the first gospel account, is symbolized by a winged man, or angel. Matthew&#x27;s gospel starts with Joseph&#x27;s genealogy from Abraham; it represents Jesus&#x27;s incarnation, and so Christ&#x27;s human nature. This signifies that Christians should use their reason for salvation.
* Mark the Evangelist, the author of the second gospel account, is symbolized by a winged lion—a figure of courage and monarchy. The lion also represents Jesus&#x27;s resurrection (because lions were believed to sleep with open eyes, a comparison with Christ in the tomb), and Christ as king. This signifies that Christians should be courageous on the path of salvation.
* Luke the Evangelist, the author of the third gospel account (and the Acts of the Apostles), is symbolized by a winged ox or bull—a figure of sacrifice, service, and strength. Luke&#x27;s account begins with the duties of Zechariah in the temple; it represents Jesus&#x27;s sacrifice in his Passion and Crucifixion, as well as Christ being high priest (this also represents Mary&#x27;s obedience). The ox signifies that Christians should be prepared to sacrifice themselves in following Christ.
* John the Evangelist, the author of the fourth gospel account, is symbolized by an eagle—a figure of the sky, and believed by Christian scholars to be able to look straight into the sun. John starts with an eternal overview of Jesus the Logos and goes on to describe many things with a &quot;higher&quot; christology than the other three (synoptic) gospels; it represents Jesus&#x27;s Ascension and Christ&#x27;s divine nature. This symbolizes that Christians should look on eternity without flinching as they journey towards their goal of union with God.

Each of the symbols is depicted with wings, following the biblical sources first in Ezekiel 1–2, and in Revelation. The symbols are shown with, or in place of, the Evangelists in early medieval Gospel Books, and are the usual accompaniment to Christ in Majesty when portrayed during the same period, reflecting the vision in Revelation. They were presented as one of the most common motifs found on church portals and apses, as well as many other locations.

When surrounding Christ, the figure of the man usually appears at top left—above Christ&#x27;s right hand, with the lion above Christ&#x27;s left arm. Underneath the man is the ox and underneath the lion is the eagle. This both reflects the medieval idea of the order of &quot;nobility&quot; of nature of the beasts (man, lion, ox, eagle) and the text of Ezekiel 1:10. From the 13th century, their use began to decline, as a new conception of &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot;, showing the wounds of the Passion, came into use. In Evangelist portraits, they sometimes appear to dictate to the writing evangelist.

==Naming==
Matthew is often cited as the &quot;first Gospel account&quot;, not only owing to its place in the canon, but also in view of the patristic witness to this effect. However, most biblical scholars see the gospel account of Mark as having been written first and John&#x27;s gospel account as having been written last of the four.

It is customary to refer to the gospels phrased as &quot;the Gospel of Matthew&quot; or as &quot;Matthew&#x27;s Gospel&quot;, and so on.

<text>Earl of Feversham is a title that has been created three times (the second time as Countess of Feversham), once in the Peerage of England, once in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. All three creations are now extinct.

The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1676 when Sir George Sondes was made Viscount Sondes and Earl of Feversham. Sondes had already been created Baron Throwley in 1676. The second Earl had already been created Baron Duras in the Peerage of England in 1673 by the time he succeeded to the earldom in 1677. However, all the titles became extinct on his death in 1709.

The second creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1719, when Ehrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Munster was made Countess of Feversham. She was created Baroness Glastonbury and Duchess of Kendal at the same time. The titles were for life only and became extinct on her death in 1743.

The third creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1868 when William Ernest Duncombe, 3rd Baron Feversham, was made Viscount Helmsley, of Helmsley in the North Riding of the County of York, and Earl of Feversham, of Ryedale in the North Riding of the County of York. For more information on this creation, see the Baron Feversham.

<doc id="803135" wikidata="Q724307" url="?curid=803135" title="Pantaleon">
<text>Pantaleon (, &quot;Pantaléōn&quot;) was a Greek king who reigned some time between 190 and 180 BC in Bactria and India. He was a younger contemporary or successor of the Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius, and is sometimes believed to have been his brother and/or subking. 

The scarcity of his coinage indicates a short reign. Known evidence suggests that he was replaced by his (probable) brother or son Agathocles, by whom he was commemorated on a &quot;pedigree&quot; coin.

==Copper-nickel coinage==
Some of his coins (as well as those of Agathocles and Euthydemus II) have another surprising characteristic: they are made of copper-nickel alloy, a technology that would not be developed in the West until the 18th century (some 1,890 years later), but was known by the Chinese at the time. This suggests that exchanges of the metallic alloy or technicians happened between China and the region of Bactria.

==Bilingual Indian-standard coinage==
He was the first Greek king to strike Indian coins, peculiar irregular bronzes representing a lion with a dancing Indian woman, probably the goddess Lakshmi (a type also known in the Post-Mauryan coinage of Gandhara), which suggests he had his base in Arachosia and Gandhara and wanted support from the native population.

<text>Routledge ( ) is a British multinational publisher. It was founded in 1836 by George Routledge, and specialises in providing academic books, journals and online resources in the fields of the humanities, behavioural science, education, law, and social science.
The company publishes approximately 1,800 journals and 5,000 new books each year and their backlist encompasses over 140,000 titles. Routledge is claimed to be the largest global academic publisher within humanities and social sciences.

In 1998, Routledge became a subdivision and imprint of its former rival, Taylor &amp; Francis Group (T&amp;F), as a result of a £90-million acquisition deal from Cinven, a venture capital group which had purchased it two years previously for £25 million. Following the merger of Informa and T&amp;F in 2004, Routledge became a publishing unit and major imprint within the Informa &quot;academic publishing&quot; division. Routledge is headquartered in the main T&amp;F office in Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire and also operates from T&amp;F offices globally including in Philadelphia, Melbourne, New Delhi, Singapore, and Beijing.

==History==
The firm originated in 1836, when the London bookseller George Routledge published an unsuccessful guidebook, &quot;The Beauties of Gilsland&quot;, with his brother-in-law W. H. (William Henry) Warne as assistant. In 1848, the pair entered the booming market for selling inexpensive imprints of works of fiction to rail travellers, in the style of the German Tauchnitz family, which became known as the &quot;Railway Library&quot;.

The venture was a success as railway usage grew, and it eventually led to Routledge, along with W H Warne&#x27;s brother Frederick Warne, to found the company, George Routledge &amp; Co. in 1851.
The following year in 1852, the company gained lucrative business through selling reprints of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, (in the public domain in the UK) which in turn enabled it to pay author Edward Bulwer-Lytton £20,000 for a 10-year lease allowing sole rights to print all 35 of his works including 19 of his novels to be sold cheaply as part of their &quot;Railway Library&quot; series.

The company was restyled in 1858 as Routledge, Warne &amp; Routledge when George Routledge&#x27;s son, Robert Warne Routledge, entered the partnership. Frederick Warne eventually left the company after the death of his brother W. H. Warne in May 1859 (died aged 37). Gaining rights to some titles, he founded Frederick Warne &amp; Co. in 1865, which became known for its Beatrix Potter books. In July 1865, George Routledge&#x27;s son Edmund Routledge became a partner, and the firm became George Routledge &amp; Sons.

By 1899, the company was running close to bankruptcy. Following a successful restructuring in 1902 by scientist Sir William Crookes, banker Arthur Ellis Franklin, William Swan Sonnenschein as managing director, and others, however, it was able to recover and began to acquire and merge with other publishing companies including J. C. Nimmo Ltd. in 1903. In 1912, the company took over the management of Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co., the descendant of companies founded by Charles Kegan Paul, Alexander Chenevix Trench, Nicholas Trübner, and George Redway.

These early 20th-century acquisitions brought with them lists of notable scholarly titles, and from 1912 onward, the company became increasingly concentrated in the academic and scholarly publishing business under the imprint &quot;Kegan Paul Trench Trubner&quot;, as well as reference, fiction and mysticism. In 1947, George Routledge and Sons finally merged with Kegan Paul Trench Trubner (the umlaut had been quietly dropped in the First World War) under the name of Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. Using C. K. Ogden and later Karl Mannheim as advisers the company was soon particularly known for its titles in philosophy, psychology and the social sciences.

In 1985, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul joined with Associated Book Publishers (ABP), which was later acquired by International Thomson in 1987. Under Thomson&#x27;s ownership, Routledge&#x27;s name and operations were retained, with the additions of backlists from Methuen, Tavistock Publications, Croom Helm and Unwin Hyman. In 1996, a management buyout financed by the European private equity firm Cinven saw Routledge operating as an independent company once again. In 1997, Cinven acquired journals publisher Carfax and book publisher Spon. In 1998, Cinven and Routledge&#x27;s directors accepted a deal for Routledge&#x27;s acquisition by Taylor &amp; Francis Group (T&amp;F), with the Routledge name being retained as an imprint and subdivision.

In 2004, T&amp;F became a division within Informa plc after a merger. Routledge continues as a primary publishing unit and imprint within Informa&#x27;s &#x27;academic publishing&#x27; division, publishing academic humanities and social science books, journals, reference works and digital products. Routledge has grown considerably as a result of organic growth and acquisitions of other publishing companies and other publishers&#x27; titles by its parent company. Humanities and social sciences titles acquired by T&amp;F from other publishers are rebranded under the Routledge imprint.

Routledge is a signatory of the SDG Publishers Compact, and has taken steps to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include achieving CarbonNeutral publication certification for their print books and journals, under the Natural Capital Partners&#x27; CarbonNeutral Protocol.

==People==
The English publisher Fredric Warburg was a commissioning editor at Routledge during the early 20th century. Novelist Nina Stibbe, author of &quot;Love, Nina&quot;, worked at the company as a commissioning editor in the 1990s. Cultural studies editor William Germano served as vice-president and publishing director for two decades before becoming dean of the humanities at Cooper Union.

== Authors ==
Routledge has published works from Adorno, Bohm, Butler, Derrida, Einstein, Foucault, Freud, Al Gore, Hayek, Hoppe, Jung, Levi-Strauss, McLuhan, Malinowski, Marcuse, Popper, Johan Rockström, Russell, Sartre, and Wittgenstein. The republished works of some of these authors have appeared as part of the Routledge Classics and Routledge Great Minds series. Competitors to the series are Verso Books&#x27; Radical Thinkers, Penguin Classics, and Oxford World&#x27;s Classics.

== Publications ==
Routledge has been criticised for a pricing structure which &quot;will limit readership to the privileged few&quot;, as opposed to options for open access offered by DOAJ, Unpaywall, and DOAB.

=== Reference works ===
Taylor and Francis closed down the Routledge print encyclopaedia division in 2006. Some of its publications were:

<text>Earl of Dartrey, of Dartrey in the County of Monaghan, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in July 1866 for The 3rd Baron Cremorne.

Thomas Dawson, Burgess of Armagh, came from Yorkshire to Ireland during the reign of Elizabeth I. During the 1650s and 1660s, his second son, Richard, a cornet in Cromwell&#x27;s cavalry, purchased 31 townlands which formed the nucleus of the family&#x27;s estates in County Monaghan. His only daughter and heiress, Frances, married her cousin Walter Dawson (died 1718) of Armagh, who built Dawson&#x27;s Grove, County Monaghan. Their son, Richard Dawson (died 1766), represented County Monaghan in the Irish House of Commons, becoming a Dublin banker and Alderman. He married Elizabeth Vesey, daughter of The Most Rev. Dr John Vesey, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Tuam and Lord Justice of Ireland.

Richard&#x27;s and Elizabeth&#x27;s third son, Thomas Dawson, also sat as Member of Parliament for County Monaghan from 1749 to 1768 in the Parliament of Ireland. In 1770, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Dartrey, of Dawson&#x27;s Grove in the County of Monaghan, and in 1785 he was made Viscount Cremorne, also in the Peerage of Ireland. Both titles were created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1797 (after his three sons had all predeceased him) he was created Baron Cremorne, of Castle Dawson in the County of Monaghan (some sources claim &quot;of Dawson-Grove in the County of Monaghan&quot;), in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to his nephew Richard Dawson, Member of the British Parliament for County Monaghan from 1801 to 1807. On Lord Cremorne&#x27;s death in 1813, the barony of Dartrey and the viscountcy became extinct.

However, Viscount Cremorne was succeeded in the Barony of Cremorne, according to the special remainder, by his great-nephew Richard Thomas Dawson, the second Baron. He was the son of the above Richard Dawson. Lord Cremorne represented County Monaghan in the British House of Commons between 1812 and 1813. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baron. In 1847 he was created Baron Dartrey, of Dartrey in the County of Monaghan, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He served as a government whip in the Liberal administrations of Lord Palmerston and Lord Russell. In 1866, he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Dartrey, of Dartrey in the County of Monaghan, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for County Monaghan from 1865 to 1868. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his youngest brother, the third Earl. He married Mary, 24th Baroness de Ros. Their eldest daughter Una succeeded her mother in the barony of de Ros (see the Baron de Ros for further history of this title). Lord Dartrey had two other daughters but no sons and on his death in 1933 all his titles became extinct.

Several other members of the Dawson family also gained distinction. Lucius Henry Dawson (died 1795), nephew of the first Viscount and uncle of the second Baron, was a captain in the Royal Navy. Thomas Vesey Dawson, also a nephew of the first Viscount and uncle of the second Baron, was Dean of Clonmacnoise. Thomas Vesey Dawson (1819–1854), second son of the second Baron, was a lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards and fought in the Crimean War, where he was killed in action at the Battle of Inkerman in 1854. His eldest son Vesey John Dawson was a major-general in the army, while his second son Douglas Dawson was a brigadier-general in the army as well as comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Department. Edward Stanley Dawson (1843–1919), second son of the first Earl, was a captain in the Royal Navy.

<doc id="803145" wikidata="Q3483106" url="?curid=803145" title="Siddha Yoga">
<text>Siddha Yoga is a spiritual path founded by Swami Muktananda (1908–1982). According to its literature, the Siddha Yoga tradition is &quot;based mainly on eastern philosophies&quot; and &quot;draws many of its teachings from the Indian yogic texts of Vedanta and Kashmir Shaivism, the Bhagavad Gita and the poet-saints.&quot; The present head of Siddha Yoga is Gurumayi Chidvilasananda.

Ashrams and meditation centers provide places to learn and practice Siddha Yoga. The two main ashrams are Gurudev Siddha Peeth in Ganeshpuri, India, and Shree Muktananda Ashram in New York State, USA. Siddha Yoga has meditation centers in several countries, including India, the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Japan.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Siddha Yoga&quot; (&quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;perfected&quot; yoga) is a Sanskrit term adopted by Muktananda to describe the path of self-realization that he embarked on under the guidance of his spiritual teacher, the Indian saint Bhagawan Nityananda. Muktananda regarded the path he learned from his teacher as a perfect path because it embraced all of the traditional yogas (jnana yoga, karma yoga, raja yoga, and bhakti yoga), spontaneously bringing the disciple to perfection in each. In 1975 Muktananda founded the SYDA Foundation (Siddha Yoga Dham Associates) to administer the work of his global &quot;meditation revolution&quot;.

&quot;Siddha Yoga&quot; has been a registered service mark of the SYDA Foundation, a domestic non-profit corporation, since 1977. As an educational service mark, it is used in teaching and conducting workshops for individual spiritual development.

The ancient generic Sanskrit term &quot;Siddha Yoga&quot; is attested in the Third Tantra of the &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; of Tirumular, a Tamil poet of the 7th or 8th century A definition of &quot;Siddha Yoga&quot; is also offered by Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha, a yogi from the dual Tirtha/Siddhayoga lineage, who wrote two books on &quot;Siddhayoga&quot; in the early 1900s:

A further definition of &quot;Siddha Yoga&quot; was offered in 1948 by Swami Purushottam Tirtha&#x27;s disciple, Swami Vishnu Tirtha:

== Teachings and practices ==

Muktananda&#x27;s Siddha Yoga is based on his personal selection &quot;from the teachings of his guru, Nityananda, and philosophical and practical traditions that preceded him, especially premodern hatha yoga, Vedanta, and Kashmir Shaivism.&quot; 

The Siddha Yoga practices are intended to help the seeker &quot;touch and expand the inner mystical state, until over time he or she becomes established in his experience of yoga or oneness with God.&quot;

=== Yoga practices ===

Siddha Yoga meditation, or the practice of turning the attention inward, involves silently focusing the attention on a mantra and on the flow of breath. The principal Siddha Yoga meditation mantra is Om Namah Shivaya.

Siddha Yoga chanting involves the use of music and sacred mantras &quot;to enter into a dialogue with the divine.&quot; There are two main types of Siddha Yoga chants: &quot;namasankirtana&quot; (lyrical chanting of Sanskrit mantras, typically the names of God), and &quot;swadhyaya&quot; (the chanting of longer Sanskrit scriptural texts). Scriptural texts chanted in Siddha Yoga ashrams and meditation centers include the morning and evening &quot;Arati&quot;; the &quot;Guru Gita&quot;, a hymn of 182 verses transmitted in the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;; &quot;Shree Rudram&quot;, an ancient hymn to Rudra (Shiva) preserved in the &quot;Krishna Yajurveda&quot;; and the &quot;Kundalini Stavah&quot;, an eight-stanza hymn to Kundalini.

Siddha Yoga students can participate in satsang, group meetings or programs held weekly at Siddha Yoga ashrams and meditation centers. Satsangs typically include talks, chanting, and meditation. The SYDA Foundation offers a variety of courses and retreats throughout the year, including the meditation intensives first developed by Muktananda in the 1970s.

Siddha Yoga students engage in seva, or &quot;selfless service&quot;, as a spiritual practice. Students can practice seva through volunteer work at an ashram or a meditation center in their city. The work of the SYDA Foundation is carried out by the work of &quot;sevites&quot;.

Other Siddha Yoga practices include japa (mantra repetition), contemplation, and dakshina, the traditional practice of making a voluntary monetary offering to a saint as an expression of gratitude for the grace and teachings one is said to have received.

=== Shaktipat ===

A central element of the Siddha Yoga path is shaktipat-diksha, literally translated as “initiation by descent of divine power,” through which a seeker’s Kundalini Shakti is awakened God-realization by the Guru. Once active, this inner power is said to support the seeker’s steady efforts to attain self-realization.

=== Holy days ===
Students of Siddha Yoga celebrate two major Hindu religious holy days: Maha Shivaratri (celebrated two days before the new moon in February/March) and Guru Purnima (celebrated on the full moon in July–August). They also celebrate the birthdays of Muktananda and Chidvilasananda; Muktananda&#x27;s divya diksha day (the day he received initiation); and the mahasamadhi anniversaries of Muktananda and Bhagawan Nityananda.

== History ==

=== Muktananda ===
==== India ====

Muktananda&#x27;s spiritual teacher, Bhagawan Nityananda, was born in South India. He first came to Ganeshpuri, a small village located 82 kilometers north of Mumbai, in 1936, settling there in a small hut built for him by the caretakers of the local Shiva temple. As his visitors and devotees increased in number, the hut expanded into an ashram. In his autobiography, &quot;Play of Consciousness,&quot; Muktananda describes how he received shaktipat initiation from Nityananda on August 15, 1947, and how he attained &quot;moksha&quot; or God-realization after nine more years of sadhana and discipleship. Nityananda installed Muktananda in a small three-room dwelling in Gavdevi, a mile from Ganeshpuri. After his death in 1961, Nityananda&#x27;s Ganeshpuri ashram was converted into a samadhi shrine and has subsequently become a renowned temple and pilgrimage site. Under Muktananda&#x27;s leadership the three-room dwelling in Gavdevi expanded into a flourishing ashram and international retreat site (Sri Gurudev Ashram, now Gurudev Siddha Peeth).

==== United States ====

From August 27 to 30, 1974, Muktananda led the first Shaktipat Intensive in Aspen, Colorado. Through Shaktipat Intensives, created by Muktananda, participants are said to receive shaktipat initiation (the awakening of Kundalini Shakti that is said to reside within a person) and to deepen their practice of Siddha Yoga meditation. Historically, Shaktipat initiation had been reserved for the few who had done many years of spiritual service and practices; Muktananda offered this initiation to newcomers and yogis alike.

In 1974, Muktananda founded the SYDA Foundation, an organization designated to protect, preserve and facilitate the dissemination of the Siddha Yoga teachings. In 1975 Muktananda founded the Siddha Yoga Ashram in Oakland in the San Francisco Bay Area, and in 1976 he established Shree Nityananda Ashram (now Shree Muktananda Ashram) in the former Gilbert Hotel, South Fallsburg in the Catskills Mountains, north of New York City. His fame increased to the point that he was made the subject of a &quot;New York&quot; magazine article (&quot;Hanging out with the Guru&quot;) and a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article (&quot;Instant Energy&quot;), both in 1976. In 1979, Muktananda created The Prison Project, designed to making the teachings, practices and experience of the Siddha Yoga path available to incarcerated seekers.
==== Death ====

Muktananda died on October 2, 1982. He appointed Gurumayi and Subhash Shetty as co-gurus of Siddha Yoga.

=== Subhash Shetty ===

Subhash Shetty (now known as Mahamandaleshwar Nityananda) is the former co-guru and spiritual leader of the Siddha Yoga path. He was appointed by Muktananda along with his sister.

In 1985, Gurumayi&#x27;s brother Nityananda stepped down &quot;in disputed circumstances&quot;, in which he and Gurumayi &quot;messily parted ways&quot;. In October 1985 he had his &quot;sannyasa&quot; vows revoked. He later told a journalist this was because he had broken his celibacy vow. A different version of the events was reported later, that there had been a battle for succession and Nityananda was forced to leave. In 1987, Nityananda started his own organization, Shanti Mandir. Both it and Shankarananda&#x27;s Shiva Yoga have been described as schisms from Siddha Yoga.

=== Gurumayi ===

One of Muktananda&#x27;s earliest and principal disciples was Malti Shetty, a young woman from Mumbai who accompanied him as his English language interpreter on his second and third World Tours. In May 1982, Muktananda installed Shetty (now known as Gurumayi Chidvilasananda or Gurumayi) along with her brother as a co-guru and spiritual leader of the Siddha Yoga path. Gurumayi is the sole spiritual leader of Siddha Yoga since her brother&#x27;s removal.

In 1992, Gurumayi&#x27;s humanitarian initiative, the PRASAD Project, was incorporated in the United States. The project is an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. It assists &quot;people to achieve lives of self-reliance and dignity by offering programs of health, education and sustainable community development in India, dental care in the United States and eye care in Mexico.&quot; In the treatment of cataracts, PRASAD de Mexico has &quot;performed free eye surgery on 26,087 adults and children.&quot; 
In 1997, Gurumayi founded the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute with its own publishing imprint, Agama Press. The mission of Muktabodha, based on Gurumayi’s original intention for the organization in 1997, is &quot;to preserve endangered texts from the religious and philosophical traditions of classical India and make them accessible for study and scholarship worldwide.&quot;

=== Moving online ===

In 2004, SYDA changed its focus from large events at its South Fallsburg ashram to bringing programs to where its followers lived. It stated this was to increase accessibility. The ashram staff was cut, and the Sadhana Kutir dormitory and office building (the former Windsor Hotel) was sold. Before 2008, the Ganeshpuri ashram had allowed Western backpackers to drop in for short stays and welcomed Indian visitors on weekends. Subsequently, only visits to its Nityananda temple and Muktananda&#x27;s shrine were permitted.

In 2011, the website was reworked to become the primary means of disseminating teachings and events. In 2013, the website began to livestream video programs. In 2020, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, Gurumayi started speaking in frequent livestreamed video satsangs. As of 2021, students may visit the ashrams only to offer short-term (less than six months) or long-term (six months or more) service, or to attend pre-booked retreats.

== Controversy ==

In 1981, Stan Trout, a swami for Siddha Yoga, wrote an open letter in which he referred a number of stories of Muktananda engaging in sexual activities with young women, and using Sidda Yoga members to harass and make death threats to force people to &quot;stop talking about your escapades with young girls in your bedroom.&quot; This included mention of former members being granted a restraining order against Muktananda and Siddha Yoga members. In 1983 William Rodarmor printed several allegations in &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; from anonymous female devotees that Muktananda regularly raped them. In the article, based on twenty five interviews, former devotees charged that Muktananda had engaged in rape of many women including underage devotees. In 1996 former devotees started a website entitled &quot;Leaving Siddha Yoga&quot; to express their grievances against Siddha Yoga. Lis Harris repeated and extended Rodarmor&#x27;s allegations in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (1994).

According to Lola Williamson, &quot;Muktananda stressed the value of celibacy for making progress on the spiritual path, but he almost certainly violated his own rules.&quot; Sarah Caldwell, in an essay in the academic journal &quot;Nova Religio&quot; (2001), argued that Muktananda was a practitioner of Shakta Tantrism, but also &quot;whatever Baba was doing, claiming it to be a form of Tantric initiation, seemed rather to retain only the bodily shell of a Tantric practice&quot;.

In November 2023 a lawsuit was filed in New York against the Siddha Yoga organization Syda Foundation on behalf of 3 plaintiffs. The lawsuit alleges a series of abuses by Swami Muktanada including rape and sexual assault during the 1970s and early 80s.

== Analysis ==

The personal quality of purity is emphasized in the Siddha Yoga tradition; the scholar of religion Karen Pechilis writes that Gurumayi&#x27;s purity is highlighted to show that she continues the guru tradition, and that she is a suitably pure person to be the spiritual leader of the organization. Pechilis comments that while purity may have been an implicit credential for her predecessor gurus, one point of view would be that it became &quot;explicit and greatly emphasized during the succession dispute and is now a primary lens&quot; for understanding Gurumayi&#x27;s spiritual path; unusually for female gurus, Pechilis writes, she was not apparently expected to marry at any time, and instead she took &quot;sannyasa&quot; in the way a male guru would.

John Paul Healy, who had been a devotee from 1981 to 1985, analysed the sociology of 32 former Siddha Yoga devotees. Some of the participants had moved to one or another of the two groups which split off from Siddha Yoga, Swami Nityananda&#x27;s Shanti Mandir and Shankarananda&#x27;s Shiva Yoga; they were moved to leave by the death of Muktananda, the changing leadership and the allegations that Muktananda had had sexual interactions with devotees, as well as changes in their own lives. Healy found that the brainwashing theory of conversion to cults did not apply to Siddha Yoga, but that people joined and stayed because they found the practice attractive, from the aromatic incense, the diet and lifestyle, the group meditation and chanting, and the experiences of the group, including of the guru. The changes within the organization after Muktananda&#x27;s death have been examined by scholars including Gene Thursby and Douglas Osto.

The scholars Jeffrey Kripal and Sarah Caldwell write that the 1997 book &quot;Meditation Revolution&quot;, which includes five recognized scholars among its six authors, essentially legitimizes, systematizes, and canonizes Chidvilasanda&#x27;s Siddha Yoga lineage. They state that this would be unexceptionable if presented as from devotees, but is problematic given their presentation of themselves as scholarly historians of religion.

The scholar of religion Catherine Wessinger comments that while devotees are varied, many are &quot;upwardly mobile&quot;, and that the path seems to attract people from Jewish and Roman Catholic backgrounds. She writes that Catholics will find many familiar features, such as venerated images of saints; the use of the rosary or &quot;mala&quot; to count repetitions of mantras; celibate &quot;ministers&quot; in distinctive robes; &quot;uplifting congregational singing; elaborate and beautiful worship and places of worship; and finally, a strong authority figure ... who[m] devotees believe is able to perform miracles in response to needs&quot;.

<text>Earl Canning was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1859 for the Conservative politician and then Viceroy of India, Charles Canning, 2nd Viscount Canning. He was the third and youngest son of the noted politician George Canning, Foreign Secretary from 1807 to 1809 and from 1822 to 1827, and Chancellor of the Exchequer and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1827. In 1828 George Canning&#x27;s widow Joan was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in honour of her husband as Viscountess Canning, of Kilbraham in the County of Kilkenny, with remainder to the heirs male of her body by her late husband. Lady Canning was the daughter of Major-General John Scott.

The first Earl Canning was childless and on his death in 1862 both titles became extinct.

Two other members of the Canning family also gained distinction. Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, and George Canning, 1st Baron Garvagh, were both first cousins of George Canning.

<text>Earl of Dublin is a title that has been created three times in British and Irish history.

It was created first on 22 October 1766 in the Peerage of Ireland for Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, younger brother of King George III. This title became extinct in 1790 upon the Duke&#x27;s dying childless. It was created again on 24 April 1799, again in the Peerage of Ireland, for Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, fourth son of George III. This title became extinct upon his death without sons, in 1820. It was created a third time on 10 September 1849 (or according to some sources, 17 January 1850) in the Peerage of the United Kingdom for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, eldest son of Queen Victoria.

<doc id="803158" wikidata="Q1262875" url="?curid=803158" title="Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro">
<text>Danilo I Petrović-Njegoš (; 25 May 1826 – 13 August 1860) was the ruling Prince of Montenegro from 1851 to 1860. The beginning of his reign marked the transition of Montenegro from a traditional theocratic form of government (Prince-Bishopric) into a secular Principality.

He became involved in a war with the Ottoman Empire in 1852, the Porte claiming jurisdiction in Montenegro, and the boundaries between the two countries were not defined until 1858. Danilo, with the help of his elder brother, Voivode Mirko, defeated the Ottomans at Ostrog in 1853 and in the Battle of Grahovac in 1858. The town of Danilovgrad is named after him.

==Rise to power as Prince==
When Petar II Petrović-Njegoš died, the Senate, under the influence of Đorđije Petrović (the wealthiest Montenegrin at the time), proclaimed Petar&#x27;s elder brother Pero Tomov as Prince (not bishop, or &quot;Vladika&quot;). Nevertheless, in a brief struggle for power, Pero, who commanded the support of the Senate, lost to the much younger Danilo who had much more support among the people.

Prior to the determination of Petar&#x27;s successor, after making peace between the Crmnica and Katunjani tribes, and being recognized by all of the Montenegrin clans except for the Bjelopavlići, Danilo traveled to Vienna, Austrian Empire and then to the Russian Empire, supposedly to be ordained as &quot;Vladika&quot;, not Prince. After Danilo returned from Russia in 1852, he took Pero and his supporters by surprise, bringing with him the endorsement from Nicholas I of Russia to become the Prince of Montenegro. Thus somewhat unexpectedly, Danilo became prince and Pero conceded defeat by returning to his position as president of the Senate.

After centuries of theocratic rule, Danilo was the first Montenegrin secular prince who did not hold the ecclesiastical position of the Vladika. He was planning to upgrade the status of Montenegro turning it into a kingdom but did not live long enough to see his ambitions realized.

==Military successes==
It was during Danilo&#x27;s reign that Montenegro won its most important battle with Turkey and its de facto independence. His charismatic elder brother, Grand Voivode Mirko Petrović-Njegoš led a 7,500 strong army and won the crucial Battle of Grahovac against the Turks (between 7,000 and 13,000) on 1 May 1858. The Turkish forces were routed. A considerable arsenal of war trophies was left in the Montenegrins hands, to come handy again in the final wars of independence in 1862 and 1875-1878. 

This major victory had had even more diplomatic significance. The glory of Montenegrin weapons was soon immortalized in the songs and literature of all the South Slavs, in particular the Serbs in Vojvodina, then part of Austria-Hungary. Montenegrin victory forced the Great Powers to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Turkey, de facto recognizing Montenegro&#x27;s centuries-long independence. In 1858, a commission of foreign powers representatives demarcated the border between Montenegro and Turkey. Montenegro gained Grahovo, Rudine, Nikšić&#x27;s Župa, more than a half of Drobnjaci, Tušina, Uskoci, Lipovo, Upper Vasojevići, and the part of Kuči and Dodoši.

==Alliance with Russia and its failure==
Danilo sought in Russia a military ally while trying not to upset Austria. His educated and wealthy wife together with Russia&#x27;s failure to live up to promise for Montenegro&#x27;s international recognition of full sovereignty, heavily influenced his Francophile attitude. This Francophile attitude was detrimental to Danilo&#x27;s relations with Russia, Austria and Serbia, who saw the good relations between Montenegro and France as a threat to their interests.

At the same time, all major European powers worked to undermine Russian influence in Southeastern Europe, which was the strongest in Montenegro. Knowing the mood of his people, Danilo refused to compromise on the sovereignty of Montenegro averting to the extent the pressure from Europeans. At the same time, Russia was in no position to help Montenegro after suffering a defeat in the Crimean War in 1854. In the subsequent Congress of Paris in 1856, Russian government representatives did not have enough strength to support Montenegrin demands for independence and territorial enlargement. However, the Russian government replied on Danilo&#x27;s memorandum &quot;that the Russian government has always recognized Montenegro&#x27;s independence and will always do so regardless of the position of other great powers&quot;. During the trip to the Second French Empire, Danilo received some financial help (200,000 francs annually) from France, hoping that France would ensure the formal recognition of Montenegro&#x27;s sovereignty. By the same token, Napoleon III hoped that this would bring Montenegro closer to French influence to the expense of Russia. This act of Danilo earned many enemies, since it was seen by many influential Montenegrins as a betrayal of Russia.Danilo&#x27;s enemies grew in numbers and included Danilo&#x27;s elder brother, Grand Voivode Mirko and the president of the Senate Đorđije Petrović. The plans to organize the elimination of the Prince were coined by the Montenegrin emigration led by Stevan Perović Cuca and assisted by foreign powers. Danilo&#x27;s loyals managed to assassinate Perović in Constantinople but the resistance to the Prince was not over.

==Danilo&#x27;s Code==
In domestic issues, Danilo was an authoritarian ruler. As it happened, the centralization of his power contributed to development of the modern functions of the state.

Danilo used the Law of Petar I Petrović-Njegoš as an inspiration for his own General Law of the Land from 1855 (&quot;Zakonik Danila Prvog&quot;). Danilo&#x27;s Code was based on the Montenegrin traditions and customs and it is considered to be the first national constitution in Montenegrin history. It also stated rules, protected privacy and banned warring on the Austrian Coast (Bay of Kotor).

Danilo organized the first census in Montenegro in 1855 and ordered that all Montenegrin households be recorded. According to the census, Montenegro&#x27;s population was 80,000.

Danilo established a tax plan, which was accepted by all tribes of Montenegro and the Hills except the Kuči; out of fear for conflict, Danilo at first did not turn to this problem, until in 1856, when he sent his brother, commander (&quot;vojvoda&quot;) Mirko to punish the Kuči. Some 247 people were killed, and the Kuči were thus forced to pay taxes as did other tribes. Another feud involved the Bjelopavlići clan, but the damage was limited by giving high ranks to the rebel leaders of the clan.

==Personal life==
After failed attempts of matching Danilo with Princess Kleopatra Karadjordjevic (1835-1855), daughter of Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia or with Baroness Anastasia Sina von Hodos und Kizdia (1838-1889), eldest daughter of a rich banker, Simon Freiherr Sina von Hodos und Kizdia, he was married on 12 January 1855 at Njeguši to Darinka Kvekić, younger daughter of Marko Kvekić and his wife, Jelisaveta Mirković. She was cousin of Spiridione Gopcevich and a member of a wealthy Serbian merchant family in Trieste. They had one daughter, Princess Olga (Cetinje, March 19, 1859 - Venice, September 21, 1896), who never married.

==Assassination and successor==
Danilo was assassinated in August 1860, as he was boarding a ship at the port of Kotor. The assassin was Todor Kadić from the Bjelopavlići clan. The Prince (&quot;Knjaz&quot;) Nikola, Danilo&#x27;s nephew, succeeded Danilo as the next secular Prince of Montenegro.

Born in Vila do Conde, Azevedo&#x27;s principal career successes were fifth overall at the 2001 Giro d&#x27;Italia, sixth overall at the 2002 Tour de France and fifth overall at the 2004 Tour de France. He also made a second place in the Germany Tour, just behind Michael Rogers. He won the queen-stage of the German competition.

Until 2005 he was a renowned domestique; his primary role was to serve as Lance Armstrong&#x27;s lieutenant in mountain stages, specifically stages in the Pyrenees Mountains. Lance Armstrong described him as the best lieutenant he has ever had. Nicknamed &quot;The Ace&quot;, he moved to US Postal (which became the now-defunct Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team) from Team ONCE (also defunct) in 2004.

In 2006 Azevedo wore the #1 background during the Tour de France and he claimed the highest finish in the general classification amongst his Discovery Channel teammates. Azevedo finished 18th overall, 37 minutes and 11 seconds behind race winner Óscar Pereiro, following the disqualification of apparent winner Floyd Landis.

To be able to spend more time with his family, Azevedo opted for a home team. He became the leader of the Benfica cycling team and aimed to win the Tour of Portugal. Azevedo finished his career at the end of the Tour of Portugal 2008.

In 2013 he was the directeur sportif for Chris Horner when he won the Vuelta.

<text>Earl of Camperdown, of Lundie in the County of Forfar and of Gleneagles in the County of Perth, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1831 for Robert Haldane-Duncan, 2nd Viscount Duncan. He was the son of the noted naval commander Admiral Adam Duncan, Baron of Lundie who was Commander-in-Chief of the North Sea from 1795 to 1801 and defeated a Franco-Dutch fleet at the Battle of Camperdown in October 1797. Later the same month he was honoured when he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth, and Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown and of Lundie in Our Shire of Perth. The first Earl was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was a Liberal politician and held minor office under Lord Palmerston from 1855 to 1858. Lord Camperdown assumed the additional surname of Haldane, which was the maiden name of his paternal grandmother. On his early death the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was also a Liberal politician and served under William Ewart Gladstone as a Lord of the Admiralty from 1870 to 1874. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, where he also died. Lord Camperdown was childless and on his death in 1933 all his titles became extinct.

William Duncan, uncle of the first Viscount, was created a baronet in 1764 (see Duncan baronets).

<doc id="803175" wikidata="Q2442570" url="?curid=803175" title="Tony Greaves, Baron Greaves">
<text>Anthony Robert Greaves, Baron Greaves (27 July 1942 – 23 March 2021) was a British politician and life peer. He was a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords.

==Education and early career==
Greaves was born on 27 July 1942 in Bradford, Yorkshire. His father, Geoffrey Greaves, was a police driving instructor and his mother was Moyra Greaves (). He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield before attending Hertford College, Oxford, where he obtained a BA in Geography. After moving to the north-west he became a member of Lancashire County Council for 25 years, and also a local councillor on Colne Borough Council and subsequently on Pendle Borough Council, on which he served until his death.

===Community Politics ===
Greaves was the mover—rather than author—of a motion at the Liberal Assembly in 1970 which committed the Liberal Party to pursuing community politics. He stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Pendle constituency in the 1997 General Election, finishing third with 11.6% of the vote.

==House of Lords==
Greaves was made a life peer on 4 May 2000 as Baron Greaves, of Pendle in the County of Lancashire. He was an advocate of social liberalism, and went on record opposing some of the reforms to his party brought about by Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg.

In 2010 Greaves went on record to express his personal frustration at the auction of a manorial title, the Lordship of Pendle, suspiciously close to his own. Greaves&#x27; concerns were later shown to be legitimate when it transpired that the Lordship of the Forest of Pendle belongs to the Barons Clitheroe and forms part of the Honour of Clitheroe holdings they have held since the Second World War. Its sale was invalid and had not been authorised by its owners.

===Criticism of sexual harassment claimants===
In 2013 Lord Greaves attracted criticism for offering comment that appeared to make light of accusations, by four Liberal Democrat members, of sexual harassment by another Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Rennard. Greaves wrote on a Liberal Democrat party message board: &quot;We don’t know the details of anything that may have happened. But it is hardly an offence for one adult person to make fairly mild sexual advances to another. What matters is whether they are . . . rebuffed. In passing, I would note and guess that if the allegations as made are a matter for resignation, perhaps around a half of the male members of the Lords over the age of 50 would probably not be seen again.&quot;

In 2015 he described complainants—who had all by then resigned from the Liberal Democrats—of having &#x27;a deliberate vendetta&#x27; against Rennard, writing &quot;I certainly accuse some of the women of not telling the truth and of a deliberate vendetta where the facts became lost in the fog of vitriol.&quot;

==Death==
Greaves died at his home in Winewall, Trawden, Lancashire, on 23 March 2021, aged 78. His death was sudden: he had made his last speech in the Lords less than a week earlier. His funeral took place on 9 April 2021.

<text>Communist Left of Spain () was a Trotskyist political party during the Second Spanish Republic. Its leader was Andreu Nin, who had been a supporter of the Left Opposition while living in Russia.

Although the group was affiliated to the Left Opposition, Leon Trotsky objected to its name, believing that it failed to stress that the organisation viewed itself as an external faction of the Communist Party. By April 1936, on the brink of the Spanish Civil War, Trotsky had denounced the Spanish left communists:

At present we must say openly that the Spanish “left communists” have allowed this extremely favorable interval to pass by completely and have revealed themselves as in no way better than the socialist and “communist” traitors. Really, there has been no lack of warnings! All the greater is the culpability of an Andres Nin, of an Andrade, &quot;etc.&quot; – With a correct policy the “Communist Left”, as a section of the Fourth International, might have been at the head of the Spanish proletariat today. Instead of this, it vegetates in the confused organization of a Maurin – without program, without perspective, and without any political importance.

It merged with the Right Opposition communist party &quot;Bloque Obrero y Campesino&quot; in September 1935, to form the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (&quot;POUM&quot;), which was also led by Nin until his kidnapping and death at the hands of NKVD in 1937.

<text>Early modern philosophy (also classical modern philosophy) was a period in the history of philosophy that overlaps with the beginning of the period known as modern philosophy. It succeeded the medieval era of philosophy. Early modern philosophy is usually thought to have occurred between the 16th and 18th centuries, though some philosophers and historians may put this period slightly earlier. During this time, influential philosophers included Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant, all of whom contributed to the current understanding of philosophy.

==Overview==
The early modern period in history is around –1789, but the label &quot;early modern philosophy&quot; is typically used to refer to a narrower period of time.

In the narrowest sense, the term is used to refer principally to the philosophy of the 17th century and 18th century, typically beginning with René Descartes. 17th-century philosophers typically included in such analyses are Thomas Hobbes, Blaise Pascal, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Isaac Newton. The 18th century, often known as the Age of Enlightenment, included such early modern figures as John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume.

The term is sometimes used more broadly, including earlier thinkers from the 16th century such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Michel de Montaigne, and Francis Bacon. Some definitions also broaden the range of thinkers included under the &quot;early modern&quot; moniker, such as Voltaire, Giambattista Vico, Thomas Paine. By the broadest definition, the early modern period is said to have ended in 1804 with the death of Immanuel Kant. Considered in this way, the period extends from the last Renaissance philosophers to the final days of the Age of Enlightenment.
Most scholars consider the period to begin with René Descartes’ &quot;Meditationes de Prima Philosophiae&quot; (Meditations on First Philosophy) in Paris in 1641 and conclude with the work of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (&quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;) in the 1780s.

At the time, various thinkers faced difficult philosophical challenges: reconciling the tenets of classical Aristotelian thought and Christian theology with the new technological advances that followed in the wake of Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton. A modern mechanical image of the cosmos in which mathematically definable universal laws directed the motion of lifeless objects without the interference of something non-physical, specifically challenged established ways of thought about the mind, body and God. In response, philosophers, many of whom were involved in experimental advances, invented and perfected various perspectives on humans’ relationship to the cosmos.

Three critical historical events that shaped Western thought profoundly were the Age of Discovery, the progress of modern science, and the Protestant reformation and its resulting civil wars. The relationship between philosophy and scientific research was complicated, as many early modern scientists considered themselves philosophers, conflating the two disciplines. These two fields would eventually separate. Contemporary philosophy&#x27;s epistemological and methodological concerns about scientific certainty remained regardless of such a separation.

The early modern intellectual era also contributed to the development of Western philosophy. New philosophical theories, such as the metaphysical, civic existence, epistemology, and rationalist thinking, were established. There was a strong emphasis on the advancement and expansion of rationalism, which placed a premium on rationality, reasoning, and discovery to pursue reality.

== Enlightenment Period ==
The Enlightenment, also referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, was a philosophical movement that dominated the realm of ideas in 18th-century Europe. It was founded on the principle that reason is the fundamental source of power and legitimacy, and it promoted principles such as liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional governance, and church-state separation. The Enlightenment was defined by a focus on science and reductionism, as well as a growing suspicion of religious rigidity. The Enlightenment&#x27;s ideals challenged the monarchy and the church, laying the groundwork for the political upheavals of the 18th and 19th centuries. According to French historians, the Age of Enlightenment began in 1715, the year Louis XIV died, and ended in 1789, the year of the French Revolution. According to some contemporary historians, the era begins in the 1620s, with the birth of the Scientific Revolution. However, during the first decades of the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th century, several national variations of the movement developed.The Englishmen Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, the Frenchman René Descartes, and the prominent natural philosophers of the Scientific Revolution, including Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, were significant 17th-century antecedents of the Enlightenment. Its origins are often ascribed to 1680s England, when Isaac Newton published his &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1686) and John Locke wrote his &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1689)—two works that laid the groundwork for the Enlightenment&#x27;s great advancements in science, mathematics, and philosophy.

The Age Of Enlightenment was swiftly sweeping across Europe. In the late seventeenth century, scientists such as Isaac Newton and authors such as John Locke challenged the established order. Newton&#x27;s principles of gravity and motion defined the universe in terms of natural principles that were independent of any spiritual source. Locke advocated the freedom of a people to replace a government that did not defend inherent rights to life, liberty, and property in the aftermath of England&#x27;s political instability. People began to mistrust the possibility of a God capable of predestining human beings to everlasting damnation and empowering a despotic ruler to rule. These ideals would permanently alter Europe.

=== Major Enlightenment concepts ===
Europe had a burst of philosophical and scientific activity in the mid-18th century, challenging established theories and dogmas. Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau headed the philosophic movement, arguing for a society founded on reason rather than religion and Catholic theology, for a new civic order based on natural law, and for science founded on experimentation and observation. Montesquieu, a political philosopher, proposed the notion of a government&#x27;s division of powers, which was enthusiastically accepted by the framers of the United States Constitution.

Two separate schools of Enlightenment philosophy existed. Inspired by Spinoza&#x27;s theory, the radical enlightenment argued for democracy, individual liberty, freedom of speech, and the abolition of religious authority. A second, more moderate kind, championed by René Descartes, John Locke, Christian Wolff, and Isaac Newton, aimed to strike a balance between reform and old power and religious institutions.

Science eventually began to dominate Enlightenment speech and thinking. Numerous Enlightenment authors and intellectuals came from scientific backgrounds and equated scientific progress with the downfall of religion and conventional authority in favour of the growth of free speech and ideas. In general, Enlightenment science placed a high premium on empiricism and logical reasoning, and was inextricably linked to the Enlightenment ideal of progression and development. However, as was the case with the majority of Enlightenment ideals, the advantages of science were not widely recognized.

The Enlightenment has traditionally been credited with laying the groundwork for current Western political and intellectual culture. It ushered in a period of political modernization in the West, focused on democratic principles and institutions and resulting in the establishment of modern, liberal democracies. The fundamentals of European liberal thought include the individual right, natural equality of all men, separation of powers, the artificial nature of political order (which resulted in the later distinction between civil society and the state), the view that all legitimate political power must be &quot;representative&quot; and based on popular consent, and liberal interpretationism.

Enlightenment-era criticism on religion was a reaction to Europe&#x27;s previous century of religious turmoil. Enlightenment intellectuals intended to limit organized religion&#x27;s political dominance, so averting another period of intolerable religious violence. Numerous unique concepts emerged, including deism (belief in God the Creator without reference to the Bible or other authoritative source) and atheism. The latter was hotly debated but garnered few supporters. Many, like Voltaire, believed that without believing in a God who punishes wrong, society&#x27;s moral order would be jeopardised.

== Characteristics ==
The early modern period arose from dramatic shifts in many fields of human endeavour. Among the most significant characteristics are the formalisation of science, the acceleration of scientific advancement, and the creation of secularised civic politics, law courts, and the nation-state. There was some skepticism against traditional interpretive concepts associated with the modern era, such as the distinction between empiricists and rationalists, which represented a philosophical and historical shift away from ethics, political philosophy, and metaphysical epistemology.

Individualism also emerged as a reaction to belief and authority, challenging the element of Christianity and Christianised philosophy united with whoever the desired political leader happened to be at the time. The steady rise of the bourgeoisie would challenge the power of the Church and begin the journey towards the eventual separation of church and state. The political and economic situation of Modern Europe would have an influence on philosophical thought, mainly on ethics and political philosophy.

The Scientific Revolution also gained legitimacy during this period. Early modern attempts to grapple with the philosophy of infinity focused on and discussed three fundamental disagreements about the infinite—differences that had their origins in the academic philosophical tradition. Philosophers such as Leibniz and Spinoza used this distinction to distinguish God&#x27;s qualitative infinity from the mathematically abstract concept of infinity. Early modern thinkers differentiated between actual and potential infinity. Academic tradition has traditionally rejected the existence of actual infinities in the created world but has acknowledged potential infinities, following Aristotle&#x27;s approach to Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes. Additionally, the advent of early modern thought was linked to changes in the period&#x27;s intellectual and cultural context, such as the advancement of natural science, theological contradictions within and between the Catholic and Protestant churches, and the growth of the modern nation-state.

== Significant thinkers ==

Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, Hobbes, and Kant, as well as philosophers such as Hugo Grotius, Pierre Gassendi, Antoine Arnauld, Nicolas Malebranche, Pierre Bayle, Samuel von Pufendorf, and Francis Hutcheson are all recognised as significant figures in early modern philosophy, for their discourses and theories developed throughout the various philosophical periods.

The political philosophy of natural law, developed by John Locke, was a common and significant concept in early modern thought. Natural law evolved into individual rights and subjective claims. Adding to Aristotle&#x27;s already known philosophy, Locke suggested that the government give its citizens what they believe are fundamental and natural rights. Thomas Hobbes, alternatively, asserted that natural law has a finite scope. Unchecked liberty led to a state of war where everybody struggled for life. Hobbes encapsulated this state of violence in one of philosophy&#x27;s most famous passages: &quot;And the life of man, solitary, bad, nasty, brutish, and brief&quot;. Thomas Hobbes&#x27; worldview concentrated on social and political order and how humans could coexist without danger or risk of civil war.

=== Thomas Hobbes ===
Hobbes&#x27; moral and political theory includes a consideration of natural rights. Hobbes&#x27; natural rights notion also included man in a &quot;state of nature&quot;. As he saw it, the basic natural (human) right was to use his power, as he will, to preserve his nature, which is to protect his life.

Natural liberty is distinct from universal laws, which Hobbes referred to as precepts, or rules discovered by reason, which ban a man from doing something that will destroy his life or deprives him of the means to retain it.

In Hobbes&#x27; view, life comprised just of freedoms and nothing else &quot;Because of that, everyone has the right to anything, even to one another&#x27;s body. Because of this, though, as long as inherent human rights to every commodity remain in place, there can be no long-term security for anybody.&quot;

This would result in the condition called the &quot;war of all against all,&quot; in which humans murder, steal, and enslave each other to remain alive. Hobbes theorised that human existence would be lonely, poor, ugly, brutish, and short in a state of chaos generated by unrestricted rights. As such, people would agree to give up many of their basic rights to build a political and civil society. Social contract theory was first articulated using this early argumentation.

Natural or institutional laws are useless without first being established by a sovereign authority. Before you can talk about right and unjust, some coercive authority must compel folks to keep their promises. There is no such coercive force before the establishment of the state. This coercive State would, in Hobbes&#x27; view, have the right to confiscate property in return for a guarantee of citizens&#x27; safety from one another and from foreign intervention.

According to social contract theory, &quot;inalienable rights&quot; are those rights that can&#x27;t be relinquished by people to the sovereign. These inherent rights were believed to be law-independent. Only the strongest could use their privileges in the state of nature. Thereby, individuals give up their natural rights to get protection, and thus have the legal rights conferred by the power to do so.

Many historical justifications for slavery and illiberal governance include consensual arrangements to relinquish inherent rights to freedom and self-determination. De facto inalienability arguments supplied the foundation for the anti-slavery movement to argue against all involuntary enslavement, not only slavery explicitly defined as such. An agreement to unlawfully divide a right would be void of law. Similarly, the argument was used by the democratic movement to reject explicit or implicit social covenants of subjection (e.g., pactum subjectionis) that subjugate a people, for example, in Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. According to Ernst Cassirer:There is, at least, one right that cannot be ceded or abandoned: the right to personality...They charged the great logician [Hobbes] with a contradiction in terms. If a man could give up his personality he would cease being a moral being. … There is no &quot;pactum subjectionis&quot;, no act of submission by which man can give up the state of free agent and enslave himself. For by such an act of renunciation he would give up that very character which constitutes his nature and essence: he would lose his humanity.

== Influence ==
Until the twenty-first century, standard accounts of early modern philosophy and traditional survey courses in Anglo-Saxon universities—presented histories dominated by Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.

Early modern theory has significantly impacted many modern developments, one of which is political philosophy. American political philosopher A. John Simmons examined two interrelated transitions in the early modern period. The first is a metaphysical contrast between political naturalism, which holds that human beings are political by birth, and political anti-naturalism, which holds that humankind&#x27;s natural state is apolitical. The second is the historical shift from &quot;complex, bureaucratic systems with intertwined religious and contractual relationships&quot; to political cultures that &quot;take the form of independent, territorial states&quot;. Observing how these transformations occur is important as the ideas advanced by early modern political theorists played an important role in the creation of political institutions that exist today.

The evolution of early modern philosophy has been recognized as inextricably linked to developments in the period&#x27;s intellectual and cultural environment through important developments in science, the Catholic and Protestant churches, and the rise of the new modern nation state.

<doc id="803181" wikidata="Q732683" url="?curid=803181" title="Watara Supervision">
<text>The Watara Supervision, also known as the QuickShot Supervision in the UK, is a monochrome handheld game console, originating from Asia, and introduced in 1992 as a cut-price competitor for Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy. It came packaged with a game called &quot;Crystball&quot;, which is similar to &quot;Breakout&quot;. One unique feature of the Supervision was that it could be linked up to a television via an official accessory. Games played in this way would display in four colors, much like Nintendo&#x27;s Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES. A full color TV link was also in the works, but because of the Supervision&#x27;s failure to make a major impression among gamers it was cancelled, along with the games which were in development for it.

Though the machine garnered some attention at launch (mainly due to the low price for the machine and its games, which many felt might enable it to make inroads into Nintendo&#x27;s market share) it was ultimately unsuccessful in unseating the Game Boy from its position as the world&#x27;s most popular handheld. Reasons commonly cited are the poor quality screen which was prone to blurring and made following the action difficult, a general lack of games and the simplistic nature of those that were released.

Yet another problem was that most of the games that were available were developed in Taiwan or Hong Kong, meaning that fans of big-name Western and Japanese developers were underwhelmed by the apparent lack of support from these companies. Only a tiny handful of games were developed by third parties, including Sachen and the British developer B.I.T.S. Up against Nintendo&#x27;s list of popular franchises (Zelda, Mario, Metroid) and those of its third parties (Castlevania, Mega Man) - all of which eventually surfaced on the Game Boy - the Supervision&#x27;s games were of little interest to most.

==Marketing==
The Watara Supervision&#x27;s main marketing point was its low price; the Supervision was US$49.95 in 1992 while the Game Boy was US$89.99. Games for the Supervision were also much cheaper than Game Boy games, and advertisements emphasized this price difference, with one British ad for the Supervision calling it &quot;the affordable hand-held games machine&quot;. It was also bundled with headphones, batteries, and a &quot;Breakout&quot; clone titled &quot;Crystball&quot;.

To keep their costs down, Watara farmed out the international marketing and distribution to third parties leading to various versions:

* Watara Supervision: sold in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Spain, Italy and Mexico. Tiltable screen configuration. 
* Quickshot Supervision (QS-800): sold in the UK by the well-known joystick brand. Tiltable screen configuration. 
* Hartung Supervision (SV-100): sold in Germany and Netherlands.
* 泰可BOY (Tiger Boy): sold in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Tai-Kerr Trading Co. 
* Audio Sonic Supervision (GB-1000, GB-2000): sold in Italy, France and other European countries. There are two known models. The GB-2000 looks like a Gameboy and the GB-1000 looks like the Watara, but without the name in the lower left corner of the screen.
* Vini Supervision: sold in Denmark and distributed by Vini Spil. Both models were also sold (the tilting one as model #9205).
* Videojet Supervision: sold in France. 
* Magnum Supervision: sold in the United States and Europe by Magnum International. Same appearance as the Videojet Supervision in three different housing colors: Gray, Yellow and Green.
* Electrolab Supervision: sold in Argentina by the Electrolab brand, under two different models: the Supervision (in a form factor resembling Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy) and the Hipervision. 
In the mid 1990s, the Supervision was once offered as a final prize on the television game show &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; (as well as &quot;Masters of the Maze&quot;). It was also offered as a prize on the premiere of the similarly short-lived &quot;The New Price is Right&quot; in 1994.

Quickshot&#x27;s UK version of the Supervision was heavily featured for a time on ITV&#x27;s gaming show &quot;Bad Influence!&quot; Presenter Violet Berlin could be seen playing a Supervision in many of the show&#x27;s publicity photos.

==History==
A prototype of the Supervision was exhibited at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 1992. The Supervision was released before Christmas 1992 with eighteen launch titles, and it was advertised that fifty games were released by November 1992. The Supervision&#x27;s game library was criticized for being &#x27;too simplistic&#x27; compared to that of other consoles, which outweighed the value of their budget price, which ranged from US$8.95 to US$14.95 per game. One critic from &quot;Electronic Games&quot; said in respect to the Supervision that &quot;it is still possible to be disappointed in a game that costs under fifteen dollars&quot;. Soon after the Supervision&#x27;s release, the Game Boy Basic packaging option was announced, which made the Game Boy more affordable, costing only ten dollars more than the Supervision; this undermined the Supervision&#x27;s &#x27;budget&#x27; marketing strategy.

Similar to the functionality of the Super Game Boy, the Supervision can be connected to a television to allow for a larger screen to play on. A peripheral that would add color support to games was planned for release in the latter half of 1993, but was never released. The Supervision was distributed in the US by Goldnation, and in France by AudioSonic. More third-party games were planned for release for the system in 1993 but never materialized, including movie licences such as &quot;Rambo&quot; and &quot;Terminator&quot;.

<doc id="803187" wikidata="Q926097" url="?curid=803187" title="Philoxenus Anicetus">
<text>Philoxenus Anicetus (Greek: , &quot;Philόxenos ho Aníkētos,&quot; meaning &quot;Philoxenus the Invincible&quot;) was an Indo-Greek king who ruled in the region spanning the Paropamisade to Punjab. Philoxenus seems to have been quite an important king who might briefly have ruled most of the Indo-Greek territory. Bopearachchi dates Philoxenus to c. 100–95 BCE and R. C. Senior to c. 125–110 BCE.

Historians have not yet connected Philoxenus with any dynasty, but he could have been the father of the princess Kalliope, who was married to the king Hermaeus.

==Coins of Philoxenos==
Philoxenus struck several series of bilingual Indian silver coins, with a reverse of a mounted king, a type previously used as obverse by Antimachus II sixty years earlier and as reverse on rare types of Nicias. Whether the horseman was a dynastic emblem or a portrait of the king as a cavalryman is unclear. Several Saka kings used similar horsemen on their coinage.

Philoxenus means &quot;lover of foreigners&quot; or &quot;hospitable&quot; in Greek, and considering that his drachms were square, a feature that was rare among Indo-Greeks but standard for Sakas, this shows that Philoxenus had good connection and relations with the nomads that had conquered Bactria.

Philoxenus struck bronzes with female deity/bull, or Helios/Nike.

Philoxenus also minted some Attic-type tetradrachms (with Greek legend only), meant for circulation in Bactria.

==Overstrikes==
One overstrike is known, of Epander over Philoxenus.

==Other coins==
Philoxenus issued a variety of different coin standards, including some Attic coins, square Indian coins, and also circular bilingual coins with Greek and Kharosthi scripts.

<doc id="803196" wikidata="Q1387162" url="?curid=803196" title="Nicias (Indo-Greek king)">
<text>Nicias (Greek: , &quot;Nikías&quot;; ) was an Indo-Greek king who ruled in the Paropamisade. Most of his relatively few coins have been found in northern Pakistan, indicating that he ruled a smaller principate around the lower Kabul valley. He was possibly a relative of Menander I.

==Time of reign==
Bopearachchi suggests that Nicias ruled c. 90–85 BC. This late date is supported by the absence of Attic coins (see below).

R. C. Senior on the other hand places him as a successor of Menander, c. 135–125 BC, according to his interpretation of hoard findings.

Regardless of which period is correct, the fact that Nicias ages visibly on his coins seems to indicate some longevity to his rule.

==The coinage of Nicias==

Nicias struck Indian silver drachms of diademed or helmeted king with three reverses:
*A standing king in armour making a blessing gesture, found on several drachms.
*An en face version of Menander&#x27;s Athena with thunderbolt is found on a unique tetradrachm.
*The third reverse is the type king on a prancing horse, as used by Antimachus II found on a single drachm.

His bronzes feature Zeus/dolphin or portrait / king on prancing horse. Some varieties are crude with lunate sigmas and square omicrons. Even though Nikias ruled in the western parts of the Indo-Greek realm, no Attic coins have been found.His monograms generally match those of the kings Theophilus and Philoxenus, though one is shared with Thraso, the short-lived son of Menander I.

<text>The Pepys Library of Magdalene College, Cambridge, is the personal library collected by Samuel Pepys which he bequeathed to the college following his death in 1703.

==Background==
Samuel Pepys was a lifelong bibliophile and carefully nurtured his large collection of books, manuscripts, and prints. At his death, there were more than 3,000 volumes, including the diary, all carefully catalogued and indexed; they form one of the most important surviving 17th-century private libraries.

Pepys made detailed provisions in his will for the preservation of his book collection, and when his nephew and heir, John Jackson, died in 1723, it was transferred intact to Magdalene. The bequest included all the original bookcases and his elaborate instructions that placement of the books &quot;... be strictly reviewed and, where found requiring it, more nicely adjusted&quot;. Under the terms of the bequest, none of the books may be sold, and no additional ones may be added to the library.

The library is housed in a room on the first floor of the Pepys Building in the second court of the college. It contains 3,000 books preserved in Pepys&#x27;s own bookcases for them (perhaps those his journal attributes to Sympson the Joiner) and organised by size as he had catalogued them.

==The collection==
The most important items in the Library are the six original bound manuscripts of Pepys&#x27;s diary but there are other remarkable holdings, including:

* Naval records compiled by Pepys when he was Secretary to the Admiralty, including two of the &quot;Anthony Rolls&quot;, illustrating the Royal Navy&#x27;s ships circa 1546, including the &quot;Mary Rose&quot;.
* Pepys&#x27; own copy of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687).
* Incunabula by William Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde and Richard Pynson.
* Sixty medieval manuscripts.
* The &#x27;Pepys Manuscript&#x27;, a late fifteenth-century English choirbook.
* Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s personal almanac.
* The earliest copy of John Heywood&#x27;s &quot;The Play of the Weather&quot;, published in 1533 shortly after being performed for Henry VIII.
* Over 1,800 printed ballads: one of the finest collections in existence and an important source for Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;.

A selection of the most interesting volumes are on display.

==Visiting==
The library is usually open to the public in the afternoons from Monday to Saturday. It is best to consult the Magdalene College website for current times.

==Pepys Building==
The Pepys Building is the principal ornament of the College and of considerable architectural interest. The plainer rear is of brick while the front is neo-classical and in Ketton stone. Built between 1670 and 1703, it has been described as &quot;a highly remarkable classical building of the date&quot;.

Construction was slow for want of money, but the project was revived after advice was sought from Robert Hooke in 1677. Samuel Pepys made three subscriptions to the building fund.

On the front of the building is the painted inscription &quot;Bibliotheca Pepysiana 1724&quot; which records the date of arrival of the library; above it are painted Pepys&#x27;s coat of arms and his motto &quot;Mens cujusque is est quisque&quot; (&quot;The mind&#x27;s the man&quot; taken from Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica&quot; 6.26).
