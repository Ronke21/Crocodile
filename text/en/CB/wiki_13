<text>Botaurus is a genus of bitterns, a group of wading birds in the heron family Ardeidae. The genus includes species that were previously placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Botaurus&quot; was introduced in 1819 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens. Stephens did not specify the type species but this was designated as &quot;Ardea stellaris&quot; Linnaeus (Eurasian bittern) by George Gray in 1840. The name &quot;Botaurus&quot; is Medieval Latin for a bittern. The word combines Latin &quot;bos&quot; meaning &quot;oxen&quot; (compare &quot;butire&quot; &quot;to boom&quot;) and &quot;taurus&quot; meaning &quot;bull&quot;. In describing the Eurasian bittern Stephens wrote: &quot;At this period the male makes a singular noise, which is compared with the deep bellowing of a bull, and is continued for about two months: ...&quot;.

The genus formerly contained fewer species. Molecular genetic studies found that the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Botaurus&quot;. To resolve the non-monophyly the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was merged into &quot;Botaurus&quot; which has priority.

The bitterns are large chunky, heavily streaked brown birds which breed in large reed beds. Almost uniquely for predatory birds, the female rears the young alone. They are secretive and well-camouflaged, and despite their size they can be difficult to observe except for occasional flight views. They eat fish, frogs, and similar aquatic life.

==Species==
The genus contains 14 species, this includes the New Zealand bittern which is now extinct.

<text>Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book is a mock self-help book by Walker Percy, published in 1983 by Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux.

Organized into roughly four sections that explore ideas of the self, Percy&#x27;s thesis is that the social ills which plague society are a result of humanity&#x27;s epic identity crisis. Percy uses semiotic theories (the theories of signs) to argue that human consciousness of the self is unique from all other &#x27;interactions&#x27; in the universe in that it is triadic. It requires two sets of dyadic interactions between that of the sign user, the sign, and what the sign stands for in order to be complete. As a result, persons are thrust into the predicament of finding a sign that &#x27;places&#x27; themselves.

The book contains numerous essays, quizzes, and &quot;thought experiments&quot; designed to satirize conventional self-help texts while provoking readers to undertake a thoughtful contemplation of their existential situations and the search for meaning and purpose that could derive from such reflections.

==Reception==
According to Andrew Hoogheem, it is:
:easily Walker Percy&#x27;s strangest book. On its surface a darkly humorous parody of the literature of self-help, this late work… runs the reader down a gauntlet of multiple-choice questions… whose cumulative effect is to leave her more bereft of answers than when she began. Along the way it conjures up dialogues between talk show hosts and long-dead theologians, inveigles its readers into seriously contemplating suicide, shoulders in on the debates of academic semioticians, presents an overview of world history that predicts World War III erupting as a consequence of Western anomie, and arrives at its denouement by way of… science fiction stories of nuclear war and alien encounters.

The book is a favorite of prominent philosopher Peter Kreeft, of Boston College, and a lecture on the subject appears on his personal website.

<doc id="799129" wikidata="Q950608" url="?curid=799129" title="The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams">
<text>The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams is a 1974 independent feature film produced by Charles E. Sellier Jr. and Raylan D. Jensen for Sunn Classic Pictures. The film&#x27;s popularity led to an NBC television series of the same name. The title character, played by Dan Haggerty, was loosely based on California mountain man John &quot;Grizzly&quot; Adams (1812–1860).

==Plot==
The film portrays the somewhat fictional Grizzly Adams as a frontier woodsman who fled into the mountains in the year 1853, after he was accused of a murder he didn&#x27;t commit. While struggling to survive, Adams saves an orphaned grizzly bear cub he adopts and names Ben. The bear, while growing to its huge adult size, becomes Adams&#x27; closest companion. Consistently kind and gentle, Adams discovers and demonstrates an uncanny ability to gain the trust of most of the indigenous wildlife of the region, and he helps, sometimes rescues, takes in and tames many species. Originally a hunter, with his learned affection for wildlife Adams resolves never to harm another animal whenever possible.

Adams also gains two human friends, an old mountain man trader named &quot;Mad Jack&quot; who is often featured with his mule (&quot;Number Seven&quot;), and a Native American by the name of &quot;Nakoma&quot;. Adams, Mad Jack, and Nakoma help myriad mountain visitors while protecting wildlife at the same time.

NBC aired the series finale of the TV series on February 21, 1982, by way of a two-hour TV movie called &quot;The Capture of Grizzly Adams&quot;; it presents an ending diverging from the 1974 TV movie portrayal. A hateful rancher, whose partner Adams allegedly killed, uses Adams&#x27; daughter Peg, who was not seen or mentioned since the 1974 film, in a ploy to lure the fugitive mountain man back to civilization and kill him. In the end, Adams exposes the rancher for the murder for which he was himself accused, proving his innocence.

==Production==
&quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot; TV series was created by Charles E. Sellier Jr. and produced through Schick Sunn Classic Pictures, a company based in Park City, Utah and operated by its founding executives, Patrick Frawley, Charles E. Sellier Jr., and Rayland Jenson. Parts of the series were shot in the Uinta National Forest, Wasatch National Forest, and Park City. The low-budget independent studio successfully introduced innovative marketing and promotional methods. Its 1974 &quot;Grizzly Adams&quot; movie was a runaway success. Produced on a small $140,000 budget, the film grossed over $45 million at the domestic box office and $65 million worldwide. It was the 7th highest-grossing film of 1974. The 43% market share captured by a 1976 airing of the film on NBC led to network executives green-lighting the television series. The series drew a 32% market share, a significant figure to this day. The series also aired at a time when the environmental movement was beginning to flourish.

Bozo was purchased from a Kansas zoo, and trained by R.E. (Bob) Leonard.

The show&#x27;s theme song, “Maybe,” was written and sung by Thom Pace. The song was released as a single in Europe. It spent nine weeks at number 1 in the single charts in Germany from November 19, 1979 to January 20, 1980. In Switzerland it reached number 2 and in Austria it rose to number 8. In 1980 won Germany&#x27;s Goldene Europa award for best song. At the beginning of each episode, part of the theme song is sung, while at the end, the entire theme song is sung. &quot;Mad Jack&quot; also introduces the circumstances of Grizzly Adams, referring to him as a &quot;greenhorn&quot;, his friendship with Ben and all of the animals. After selling many products bearing the Grizzly Adams brand name, the brand was eventually trademarked by its creator, film producer, Charles E. Sellier, Jr. Following Sellier&#x27;s death in early 2011, the brand rights were transferred to Grizzly Adams LLC.

Production for the series also took place in Utah, with location work in Arizona and Ruidoso, New Mexico, depending on weather conditions, due to the similarities in terrain. As with the film, animals were provided and trained by the Olympic Game Farm, housed at a second game farm built at Woodland. A scaled-down version of Grizzly Adams&#x27; cabin, used to make Dan Haggerty appear taller, is currently located at the Olympic Game Farm in Sequim, Washington.

==Home media==
Shout! Factory, under license from CBS Home Entertainment, released both seasons in two region-1, 4-DVD sets: season 1 on November 6, 2012, and Season 2 on February 19, 2013. The same eight discs were reissued as &quot;Grizzly Adams: The Complete Series&quot; on May 31, 2016.

The Season sets do not include the 1974 film &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot;, which led to the series.

<doc id="799139" wikidata="Q2095248" url="?curid=799139" title="1981 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1981 Atlantic hurricane season featured direct or indirect impacts from nearly all of its 12 tropical or subtropical storms. Overall, the season was fairly active, with 22 tropical depressions, 12 of which became named storms. 7 of those reached hurricane status and a further 3 intensified into major hurricanes. The season officially began on June 1, 1981, and lasted until November 30, 1981. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, tropical cyclogenesis can occur before these dates, as demonstrated with the development of two tropical depressions in April and Tropical Storm Arlene in May. At least one tropical cyclone formed in each month between April and November, with the final system, Subtropical Storm Three, becoming extratropical on November 17, 1981.

Although many tropical cyclones impacted land, few caused significant damage. Tropical Depression Eight was the most devastating storm of the season, causing five fatalities and $56.2 million in damage due to flooding over southeast Texas in August. During the same month, Hurricane Dennis produced heavy rainfall across Florida&#x27;s Miami metropolitan area and in parts of southeastern North Carolina, killing three people and leaving about $28.5 million in damage. Tropical Depression Two, Tropical Storm Bret, and Hurricane Katrina also resulted in fatalities. Collectively, the Atlantic tropical cyclones of this season were responsible for about $88.7 million in damage and 14 deaths.

==Seasonal summary==
The 1981 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. The season was high in activity, with 22 cyclones, 12 of which intensified into tropical or subtropical storms. Of those, seven intensified into a hurricane, while three strengthened into a major hurricane. This activity exceeded the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&#x27;s 1950-2005 average of 11 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. Although most of the systems made landfall or otherwise impacted land, few caused extensive damage or fatalities. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the 1981 Atlantic hurricane season caused about $88.7 million in damage and 14 deaths.

Tropical cyclogenesis began early, with two tropical depression forming in April, the first of which developing on April 6. Both tropical depressions were operationally unnumbered. Tropical Storm Arlene formed on May 6. The storm made landfall in Cuba two days later, before being absorbed later by a low. Tropical Depression Two moved out of the Gulf of Mexico into eastern Texas on June 5, producing localized rainfall amounts of and numerous tornadoes over Louisiana before recurving across the Southeast United States. Another previously unnumbered tropical depression formed over the Bay of Campeche later that month on June 17. It made landfall in Mexico south of Tampico before dissipating about two days later. Tropical Storm Bret formed as a subtropical low in the open Atlantic Ocean north of Bermuda on June 29, and made landfall in the Delmarva Peninsula.

The last of four previously unnumbered tropical depressions developed near Andros on July 2. It made landfall in southeast Florida and later in South Carolina before dissipating on July 4. Tropical Depression Four formed in the Gulf of Mexico on July 25, moving into Mexico the next day, and causing heavy rains in west Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas when its remnants moved into the United States. Tropical Storm Cindy formed on August 2 in the open Atlantic and became an extratropical cyclone on August 5. Hurricane Dennis formed on August 7 near South America. Dennis degenerated into a depression while making landfall in the Leeward Islands, but regained storm strength while over Cuba. Dennis moved near the southeast United States coastline from Florida to Virginia, briefly becoming a hurricane. Dennis weakened into a tropical storm and was declared an extratropical cyclone on August 22.

Tropical Depression Seven formed in mid-August and tracked through the Windward Islands before dissipating near Trinidad and Tobago. Tropical Depression Eight led to a significant flooding event between San Antonio and Houston on August 30 and August 31 while recurving through Texas into Louisiana. Hurricane Emily formed on September 1 southeast of Bermuda. Emily made a cyclonic loop as a tropical storm. Emily strengthened into a hurricane out in the North Atlantic Ocean and by September 12, was no longer identifiable. Hurricane Floyd was a Category 3 hurricane that grazed Bermuda, but no damage was reported. Hurricane Gert formed September 8, strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane, and followed the same track as Floyd, dissipating near the Azores. Hurricane Harvey became the strongest storm of the season, reaching Category 4 strength. Harvey never affected land, but ships reported tropical storm-force winds. Tropical Depression Thirteen brought gusts of tropical storm force to Bermuda in mid-to-late September. Hurricane Irene also stayed out at sea, reaching Category 3 strength before becoming extratropical in early October. The extratropical remnants of Irene made landfall in France.

Tropical Depression Fifteen was small and well-organized as it crossed the tropical Atlantic before weakening as it moved through the northeast Caribbean and southwest North Atlantic during late September and early October. Tropical Storm Jose was a short-lived storm forming out in the open Atlantic in late October. Jose never affected land and dissipated on November 1 near the Azores. Hurricane Katrina formed in the Caribbean Sea, and made landfall in Cuba after reaching hurricane strength. The final storm of the season, Subtropical Storm Three, formed in the Atlantic Ocean on November 12 and moved north, making landfall in Nova Scotia and becoming extratropical soon after.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 100, which is classified as &quot;near normal&quot; by NOAA and is slightly higher than the 1951-2000 average of 93.2. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

==Systems==
===Tropical Storm Arlene===

An area of thunderstorms originated in the eastern Pacific Ocean in early May, which crossed Central America into the western Caribbean, developing a low-level circulation on May 5 off the coast of Honduras. Thunderstorms were disorganized at first, although it organized sufficiently to develop into a tropical depression on May 6 near the Cayman Islands. It was a rare example of an Atlantic depression forming from a disturbance that originated in the eastern Pacific. Spiral rainbands developed around the center, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Arlene on May 7 while moving generally northeastward, steered by a ridge to its north. Arlene attained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) before it moved ashore in eastern Cuba early on May 8. While crossing eastern Cuba, the circulation of Arlene became ill-defined, and the storm weakened into a tropical depression, with strong wind shear exposing the circulation. After an area of thunderstorms reformed, Arlene re-intensified after exiting Cuba, reaching winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) over the southeastern Bahamas, based on observations from the Hurricane Hunters. Arlene soon weakened again back to a tropical depression, and on May 9 the system was absorbed by an advancing trough. Late the next day, the combined systems reorganized and resembled having some subtropical characteristics, although it weakened further by May 11.

As Arlene was approaching its first landfall, the National Hurricane Center noted the potential for heavy rainfall in Jamaica, Cuba, and the Bahamas; small boats in those regions were advised to remain at harbor. Meanwhile, the government of the Bahamas issued storm warnings for the central and southeastern portion of its country. There were no reports of damage or casualties from Cuba or the Bahamas, and therefore storm affects were judged to have been minimal. Early in the duration of Arlene, Cayman Brac reported winds; later, peak winds in the Bahamas reached around 35 mph (55 km/h). Arlene was the only May tropical storm on record to affect the Cuban province of Camagüey, although its passage was mostly noticed in its disruption of sugar cane production.
===Tropical Depression Two===

A tropical depression formed in the Bay of Campeche on June 3. Classified as Tropical Depression Two, the system moved north-northwest, lured by a closed upper-cyclone over the southern Great Plains. Shortly before 12:00 UTC on June 5, the depression made landfall near Matagorda, Texas, with winds of . Surface observations indicate that the depression&#x27;s barometric pressure at landfall ranged from . Although the depression dissipated later on June 5, its remnants quickly recurved through the Mississippi Valley, and deepened as it moved off the coast of the Mid-Atlantic states into the Atlantic on June 7.

The depression, in conjunction with an upper-level low, dropped heavy rainfall in the Greater Houston area, with a peak total of at Lake Anahuac. In Texas City, of water inside 16 homes forced the evacuation of their occupants, with at least 23 homes suffering water damage. Water also entered city hall. Some roads had roughly of standing water, stranding some motorists for hours. In Galveston, a tornado damaged forty homes and apartments, with severe damage to three homes and two apartment units. One business suffered major roof damage, while several cars were damaged at an auto dealership. The depression also spawned eight tornadoes in Louisiana. The most destructive tornado touched down in Rapides Parish, where it substantially damaged or destroyed thirty-eight cars at a dealership in Lecompte, severely damaged five homes and caused minor damage to four others, downed large trees, and tossed an 18-wheeler truck approximately . Overall, the depression killed three people, two due to flooding and one from an associated tornado. At least $4 million in damage was caused by this depression.
===Tropical Storm Bret===
A low-pressure area initially associated with a frontal system developed into a subtropical storm on June 29 while roughly east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The system headed westward and transitioned into Tropical Storm Bret around 06:00 UTC on June 30. Bret attained its peak intensity six hours later with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum atmospheric pressure of . However, Bret rapidly weakened as it approached the Mid-Atlantic and deteriorated to a minimal tropical storm by the time it made landfall on the Delmarva Peninsula early on July 1. The cyclone dissipated over northern Virginia several hours later.

Rainfall amounts were light, with a narrow area of over of precipitation reported near its track and within the central Appalachians, while a peak total of was observed at Big Meadows, Virginia. Locally heavy rains in western Pennsylvania caused some basement and street flooding. No significant damage was reported, but one fatality occurred at Nags Head, North Carolina, due to riptides.
===Tropical Depression Four===

A tropical disturbance moved across the Caribbean sea between July 20 and July 24 before moving across the Yucatán peninsula. After emerging into the south-central Gulf of Mexico, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression early on July 25. The depression moved west-northwest into northeast Mexico on July 26 before its surface circulation dissipated. Heavy rains fell across western Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas when the remains of this system interacted with a stationary front across the southern Plains between July 28 and July 30.
===Tropical Storm Cindy===

A cold front moved offshore North Carolina on July 30. An area of disturbed weather along the tail-end of the front subsequently began to develop cyclonic banding, resulting in the formation of a subtropical depression late on August 2 about northwest of Bermuda. After acquiring more central dense overcast, the subtropical depression transitioned into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on the following day. Soon, the depression also intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy late on August 3 about midway between Bermuda and Nova Scotia. Cindy tracked east-northeast until becoming extratropical on August 5 as it moved over colder sea surface temperatures to the southeast of Newfoundland.
===Hurricane Dennis===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 5. Two days later, the wave developed into a tropical depression well south of the Cape Verde Islands. The depression intensified into a tropical storm early on August 8. However, Dennis then encountered strong wind shear, causing the storm to weaken to a tropical depression on August 11. After crossing the Windward Islands on August 12, Dennis entered the Caribbean but degenerated into a tropical wave early the following day. The wave became a tropical depression again late on August 15 while approaching Cuba. Dennis reintensified into a tropical storm around 00:00 UTC on August 16, just prior to landfall near Playa Girón, Matanzas Province. The cyclone emerged into the Straits of Florida hours later, before striking the Florida Keys and then mainland Monroe County early the next day. It drifted across Florida, reaching the Atlantic near Cape Canaveral on August 19. Dennis continued to intensify and made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, but moved east-northeastward and soon tracked offshore. Late on August 20, Dennis deepened into a hurricane with winds of , before weakening to a tropical storm over colder waters on August 21. Dennis became extratropical northeast of Bermuda early on August 22 and persisted until being absorbed by a frontal system on August 26.

In the Caribbean, Dennis dropped heavy precipitation on some islands, including Martinique, Saint Lucia, the Virgin Islands, and the Greater Antilles. Flooding in Jamaica left at least 50 people homeless. In Florida, heavy rain fell in many areas to the east of the storm&#x27;s path. Much of southeast Florida received at least of precipitation, while over of rain fell in Homestead. Nearly all of Dade County was flooded to the south of Kendall Drive. Many businesses and homes in cities such as Homestead and Florida City suffered water damage. However, the worst damage was incurred to crops, which experienced a loss of over $17.26 million. One death and nearly $18.5 million in damage occurred in Florida. Farther north, Dennis also caused flooding in the Carolinas, inundating many streets and causing crop damage in both states. A weather-related traffic accident in South Carolina resulted in two fatalities. Twenty families in Columbus County, North Carolina, evacuated after the Waccamaw River overran its banks. Overall, Dennis left caused three deaths and about $28.5 million in damage.
===Tropical Depression Seven===

This system developed over the tropical Atlantic Ocean on August 18, moving westward and then southwestward towards the Windward Islands. The depression dissipated east of Trinidad and Tobago late on August 21.
===Tropical Depression Eight===
Tropical Depression Eight developed from a tropical disturbance over the Bay of Campeche on August 26. Moving northwestward, the cyclone failed to intensify into a tropical storm before making landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico on August 28, with winds of . After moving inland, the depression curved north-northwestward before degenerating into a surface low-pressure area near the Mexico–United States border on August 29. The remnants moved eastward across Texas and entered Louisiana before dissipating on September 1.

Although the system was only a surface low upon reaching Texas, a large thunderstorm complex developed near its center on August 29. This resulted in heavy rainfall across southeastern Texas, with a peak total of in Pine Springs in Fayette County, with much of that falling in only about six hours. One of the hardest hit areas was Lavaca County. At least 15 streets in downtown Hallettsville were flooded, damaging hundreds of cars, 150 to 200 homes, 75 businesses, and a few local government buildings. Five people were killed by floodwaters in Shiner. Throughout Lavaca County, more than 286 homes were damaged or destroyed, 17 bridges and several roads were washed out, and hundreds of head of cattle were drowned. The depression spawned 14 tornadoes, one of which caused extensive damage in the Galveston area. Overall, the depression left more than $56.2 million in damage.
===Hurricane Emily===

On September 1, a subtropical storm became Tropical Storm Emily southwest of Bermuda. Emily moved northeast, crossing the island the next day, but measured winds were below tropical storm force. The storm continued generally northeast and strengthened into a hurricane. Hurricane Emily weakened over the north Atlantic and was no longer identifiable as a weather system by September 12. Hurricane Emily caused beach erosion across the East Coast of the United States, but no other damage was reported.
===Hurricane Floyd===

Floyd was first tracked as a tropical depression on September 3 when it organized east of the Leeward Islands. As the depression moved northwest, it caused heavy rain. The highest rainfall reported was at Antigua. It strengthened into a tropical storm, then reached hurricane strength on September 7. Floyd turned to the northeast and passed just southeast of Bermuda as a weakening hurricane. As a tropical storm, Floyd moved east across the Atlantic until losing its identity on September 12.

No damages are associated with Floyd. Although Bermuda was directly affected, the island experienced the weaker half of the storm.
===Hurricane Gert===

A tropical wave exited western Africa on September 1, gradually developing a concentrated area of convection. Early on September 7, satellite imagery indicated that Tropical Depression Eleven formed about east of the Leeward Islands. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gert on the following day. The newly upgraded storm passed between Dominica and Guadeloupe and continued to intensify, making landfall on southeastern Puerto Rico with winds of late on September 8. After emerging into the Atlantic, Gert weakened while passing just north of the Dominican Republic. It restrengthened while turning northward near the Bahamas, becoming a hurricane on September 10. Midday on September 11, Gert peaked with winds of and a minimum pressure of . The hurricane turned northeastward and weakened over cooler waters, passing about north of Bermuda on September 12 as a tropical storm. On September 14, Gert weakened further to tropical depression status, dissipating the next day.

While passing through the Leeward Islands, Gert dropped moderate rainfall of on St. Thomas. Winds gusted to on the island. In Puerto Rico, rainfall peaked at in the municipality of Maricao, flooding some highways. Several towns on the southside of the island lost electricity during the storm due to downed power lines. Gale warnings were issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and later the southeastern Bahamas, and light rainfall occurred in the region, reaching on the island of San Salvador. Winds were light in Bermuda.
===Hurricane Harvey===

Harvey formed in the central Atlantic, reaching hurricane strength only a few hours after first becoming a named system on September 12. From its initial position several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands, Harvey moved northwest. Its path began curving more to the north, and was considered a threat to Bermuda until the continuing curve took Harvey away from the island. Harvey&#x27;s track became more easterly, and the storm weakened and became extratropical as it approached the Azores. Harvey caused no reported damage, although several ships reported experiencing tropical-storm-force winds.
===Tropical Depression Thirteen===

The thirteenth operationally classified tropical depression developed southwest of Bermuda on September 23, and was initially expected to intensify into a tropical storm. Although it failed to further intensify, Tropical Depression Thirteen brought squalls to Bermuda with winds gusts of tropical storm-force as it passed west of the island later that day. Moving northward, the system merged with a developing extratropical cyclone south of Nova Scotia on September 24.
===Hurricane Irene===

Satellite imagery detected a tropical disturbance off the coast of Africa on September 19. By September 23, the disturbance had developed a closed circulation and was designated as Tropical Storm Irene. The storm tracked northwest, becoming a hurricane on September 25. Irene then began to curve eastward as it gradually strengthened. On September 28, Irene strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane and reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of . Irene then gradually weakened, weakening below hurricane strength on October 1. Early on October 2, Irene became extratropical while located north of the Azores. The remaining extratropical storm moved over France on October 3.

===Tropical Depression Fifteen===

This tropical depression formed southwest of the Cape Verde Islands on September 27, and tracked through the deep tropics before weakening as it moved over the Leeward Islands late on September 30. Heavy rains occurred at Guadeloupe as the system passed by the island. The depression then recurved to the south and east of Bermuda late on October 4.
===Tropical Storm Jose===

Jose was a weak and short-lived tropical storm that formed far from land on October 29. It moved generally northeast before becoming subtropical and then dissipating on November 1 near the Azores.
===Hurricane Katrina===
A tropical depression formed on November 3 in the western Caribbean Sea about south of the Cayman Islands. The depression moved north, reaching tropical storm strength as it moved through the Cayman Islands. Katrina continued to strengthen, reaching hurricane strength half a day before landfall in Cuba. A weakening Katrina moved across eastern Cuba on November 6. After emerging over water, the storm accelerated northeast through the Bahamas. Katrina&#x27;s circulation fell apart, and the storm merged with a front on November 8.

The storm dropped heavy rainfall in the Cayman Islands and spawned a waterspout on Grand Cayman that resulted in minor damage. In Cuba, Katrina reportedly caused widespread flood damage, especially in Camagüey Province. A total of 4,641 homes were damaged to some degree, while 39 were demolished. Two deaths also occurred in Cuba. Heavy precipitation in the Bahamas caused significant crop losses on Long Island.
===Subtropical Storm Three===

A frontal low over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream organized into a subtropical storm on November 12 while east of Jacksonville, Florida. After moving northeastward, it turned to the northwest, threatening the northeastern United States as an intensifying subtropical storm that was gradually developing tropical characteristics. A high pressure system turned it to the northeast, and after peaking at it became extratropical near Nova Scotia on November 17. The storm produced significant beach erosion and coastal flooding.
===Other systems===
Four additional tropical depressions formed during the season which were operationally thought to have not developed and thus went unnumbered. The first such system developed northeast of the Lesser Antilles on April 6. Moving slowly southwestward, the depression dissipated over the Anegada Passage about 24 hours later. A small craft advisory and special marine warning were issued by the National Weather Service office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On April 19, another tropical depression formed over the southwestward Caribbean. The depression moved northeastward through the following day, before doubling-back to the southwest and dissipating by April 21. Another previously unnumbered tropical depression formed over the Bay of Campeche on June 17. It made landfall in Mexico south of Tampico before dissipating about two days later. A fourth unnumbered tropical depression developed near Andros on July 2. It made landfall in southeast Florida and later in South Carolina before dissipating on July 4. The depression dropped up of rainfall in Broward County, Florida, causing localized flooding. A waterspout-turned-tornado at Port Everglades overturned a shed and downed some power lines. Heavy precipitation also fell in South Carolina, especially in Clarendon and Sumter counties, inundating crops and flooding some cars, homes, a school, and stores in the Mayesville area.

==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1981. Most names were used for the first time, except for &quot;Arlene&quot;, &quot;Cindy&quot;, and &quot;Irene&quot;, which had been previously used under the old naming convention. No names were retired following the season, thus the same list was used again for the 1987 season.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1981 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1981 USD.

<text>Knox College is a private liberal arts college in Galesburg, Illinois. It was founded in 1837 and offers more than 60 courses of study.

==History==
Knox College was founded as Knox Manual Labor College by Presbyterians and Congregationalists from New York state organized by George Washington Gale, who previously had founded the Oneida Institute. Gale in 1836 released a &quot;Circular and Plan&quot; for the founding of a manual labor colleges which described a subscriber- and land purchase-based method of funding. His plan resulted in the founding of at least one school when in 1837 subscribers settled in what became Galesburg and began to build the college. The first President was Hiram Huntington Kellogg Sr., who went on a book-buying trip to England; the books he acquired form the Knox Manual Labor College Collection. Knox opened to students in 1843 and was one of the earliest colleges to admit Black people and women. Like Gale, many of the founders of Knox College and residents of Galesburg were abolitionists and actively supported the Underground Railroad.

Knox has been known by its present name since 1857. The name came about as a compromise among its founders. Though founded by a colony of Presbyterians and Congregationalists, the county where the college stands was already named Knox County, after Henry Knox, the first United States Secretary of War. Arguments have also been made that the college was named for Calvinist leader John Knox. It is not certain for which Knox it was named (if not both). George Candee Gale, a great-great-grandson of two of the founders, explains that

Contrary to general belief, Knox was not named for either General Knox or the Scottish Presbyterian Knox, according to my father... Some wanted the college named for one Knox, some for the other; so they compromised on KNOX. Certainly most of them were pious enough to want the churchman and fighters enough to want the soldier as well.

Jonathan Blanchard&#x27;s presidency led the school out of debt, but ignited a controversy about whether the school was loyal to the Congregational church or the Presbyterians. Gale and Blanchard were forced out of the school as a result. Knox was the site of the fifth debate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas in 1858. The Old Main building is the only extant site of the debates. Two years after the debates, during his presidential campaign, Lincoln was awarded Knox College&#x27;s first honorary doctorate—a Doctor of Laws degree, announced at the commencement exercises of 5 July 1860.

In 1841, a Female Seminary was built. The building burned down in 1843, but the college continued to provide classes for women, first in co-ed preparatory classes, then, by 1850, in the Female Collegiate Department. In 1857, a new 5-story Female Seminary building was constructed which accommodated up to ninety women. In 1867, the Knox College president William Curtis assaulted the Principal of the Female Seminary, Ada Howard. Curtis resigned after students protested and conducted a sit-down strike. In 1872, women were awarded college degrees for the first time at the college. As more women began to attend, the building was expanded in 1885. The addition was named Whiting Hall in recognition of the Principal of the Female Seminary Mrs. M. H. Whiting. In 1891, the college became fully co-ed. In 1892, the building was expanded again, and the entire building became Whiting Hall. It remained the sole women&#x27;s dormitory until after WWII.

==Academics==

Knox employs a 3–3 academic calendar rather than a traditional semester-based approach. In each of the three 10-week terms, students take three courses. Faculty members teach two courses each term, giving them more time for one-on-one mentoring.

All courses of study at Knox contain common elements, including an educational plan that students design.

With the implementation of Renewed Knox, the 2003 curriculum overhaul, the school expanded its academic offerings to meet the needs of a 21st-century liberal arts education. In 2003, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute awarded the school $1 million to create a new major in neuroscience; in 2005, the college signed agreements with The George Washington University to create an early admission program into the university&#x27;s medical school, and with the University of Rochester to create a direct admissions program into the university&#x27;s Simon School of Business&#x27;s MBA program; in 2007 the Peace Corps launched a new program at Knox, establishing the Peace Corps Preparatory Program, the first of its kind in the country; Chinese language instruction, Asian Studies, Environmental Studies, and Film Studies were all added; and new abroad studies programs have been created: the Japan Term, and Knox in New York.

Knox is also known for its Green Oaks term, an interdisciplinary program at the Green Oaks Biological Field Station. The Green Field Station began in 1955 under the guidance of zoologists Paul Shepard and George Ward.

The three most popular majors at Knox, based on 2021 graduates, were Business Administration and Management (28), Psychology (28), and Creative Writing (23).

===Lincoln Studies Center===
Rodney Davis and Douglas L. Wilson established the Lincoln Studies Center in 1998. The center deals with issues relating to Lincoln&#x27;s life and legacy by fostering new research, publishing monographs, hosting annual lectures and occasional symposia. Students are often employed as assistants in the various projects at the center. In August 2009, the National Endowment for the Humanities &quot;We the People&quot; initiative awarded Knox $850,000, &quot;a grant that will provide the base of a permanent endowment for the Center.&quot;

==Admission==
According to the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, Knox is considered a more selective institution, with a lower rate of transfer-in students. In the fall of 2018, 2,738 students applied, 2,500 students were admitted, and 345 chose to enroll. Of the class of 2017, 34% of students were in the top tenth of their class and 66% in the top quarter. The ACT composite Mid-50% range was 24–30 and the SAT mid-50% Range 1190–1380.

===Student body===
1,258 students were enrolled at Knox in September 2019. They came from 45 states and territories and 49 countries. Forty percent of U.S. students are of color and 19% are international students. Women make up 57% of the student body, men 43%.

===Tuition===
The comprehensive cost (tuition, room, board and fees) of an academic year at Knox was $60,144 in 2019–2020. 
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the median federal debt of Knox College graduates who received student loans was $27,000. In addition, only 63% of students who attended Knox earned, on average, more than those with only a high school diploma.

==Student life==

===Greek organizations===
Knox College is home to nine Greek-letter organizations, the oldest of which has been on campus since 1855. 

===Traditions===

Pumphandle is an annual tradition dating back to 1885 during which new members of the community are welcomed to Knox. On the afternoon before the start of the academic year, all members of the Knox community gather on the south lawn outside Old Main. The president of the college &quot;leads the welcoming line, shaking each person&#x27;s hand in turn. Everyone shakes the hands of those who have gone before, and the line grows, snaking around the campus.&quot;

Flunk Day is an annual spring carnival that allows students, staff, and faculty to mingle and have fun. Classes are canceled for the day as the student body turns its attention to a joke issue of the student newspaper, live music, inflatable bounce rooms, petting zoos, a mud pit, a paint fight, and a seniors vs faculty softball game. The date of Flunk Day changes every year and is a secret until the entire student body is awakened at around 5am on the day.

===Student media===
* &quot;The Knox Student&quot; — a weekly student newspaper
* &quot;Catch&quot; — a literary magazine
* &quot;Cellar Door&quot; — a workshop magazine
* &quot;The Common Room&quot; — online journal of literary criticism
* &quot; Quiver&quot; — a literary magazine of genre fiction
* &quot;X —&quot; a visual arts journal

&quot;The Knox Student&quot; has won numerous awards as one of the best college newspapers in the state of the Illinois, including numerous first-place category awards and general excellence awards from the Illinois College Press Association.

Knox&#x27;s radio station is WVKC. It is on the fourth floor of George Davis Hall, a former science building that now houses the social science and language departments. Its frequency in Galesburg is 90.7. The &quot;Princeton Review&quot; ranked it #7 in the nation for &quot;great college radio station&quot; in its 2011 &quot;Best 368 Colleges&quot;.

===Athletics===

The Knox College mascot is the &quot;Prairie Fire&quot;, a name it adopted in 1993 due to sensitivity about its previous nickname, the &quot;Old Siwash&quot;. The word &quot;Siwash&quot; is a corruption of the French term &quot;sauvage.&quot; This was a derogatory term used by European traders to refer to the indigenous people, with the French explorers experiencing Native American warfare tactics as barbaric and savage. The term &quot;Old Siwash&quot; was popularized by George Helgesen Fitch (Knox Class of 1897) in his Saturday Evening Post articles and a book &quot;At Good Old Siwash&quot;, and was adopted as the school&#x27;s nickname. The term was widely used to denote small midwestern liberal arts colleges because of the popularity of Fitch&#x27;s writings. In 1992 a college publication urged the school to reconsider the name given its additional previously unknown pejorative implications. The &quot;Prairie Fire&quot; refers to the annual spring burning of the prairie lands at Green Oaks. First conducted in the 1950s by Knox professor Paul Shepard, the burn protects prairie grasses from intrusions of woodland scrub and competition with &quot;exotic&quot; species. These invasive species have been introduced to Illinois from other regions or countries to the detriment of organisms that have evolved over millions of years in delicate balance with the environment and each other.

Knox is a member of the Midwest Conference of the NCAA at the Division III level. The school offers 21 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity sports, as well as 11 club sports, including water polo, fencing, and ultimate frisbee. 21st century athletic highlights would certainly include a string of conference championships for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams from 2014 through 2021 with the Men&#x27;s Soccer team producing All-American Forward Adetayo Adefioye and All region selections Nathaniel Logie, Charles Edemba and Raleigh Berry. All-American baseball player Drake Sykes&#x27; outstanding 2016 season. In addition, two-time All-American wrestler Jaran Rutledge placed in the NCAA Division III National Tournament in 2007 (3rd) and 2008 (8th), high-jumper Austin Rauch finished sixth at the 2019 NCAA Division III Indoor track national championships, and track stars Tyrell Pierce and Derrick Jackson were NCAA Division III All-American runners multiple times in the early 2020s. Most recently, the conference champion women&#x27;s basketball team competed in the national tournament in 2023.

Knox College and Monmouth College have the sixth-longest college football rivalry in the United States. The Bronze Turkey trophy, awarded annually to the victor of their game, was created in 1928 and is the brainchild of Knox football alumnus Bill Collins. ESPN named the Bronze Turkey the fifth &quot;most bizarre college football rivalry trophy&quot;. Monmouth has dominated the rivalry in recent years, with Knox last winning the game in 1998.

===Transportation===
Galesburg Transit provides Knox College students and faculty with free public transit within Galesburg.

==Campus==

Knox College has 45 academic and residential buildings on its campus. It has electron microscopes, a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, a 17-inch (0.43 m) Corrected Dall-Kirkham reflector telescope manufactured by Planewave Instruments, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer, access to the Inter University Consortium for Political &amp; Social Research, the Strong Collection of 18th- and 19th-century maps and photographs, the Hughes Collection of manuscripts and first editions from Hemingway and his &quot;Lost Generation&quot; contemporaries, and a natural prairie reserve, the Green Oaks Field Station. In 2018, a phased plan to renovate the Umbeck Science-Mathematics Center (SMC) was announced with classes being taught in the renovated space beginning with the winter term of 2020, with additional phases of renovations to follow. In 2006, the new E. &amp; L. Andrew Fitness Center was dedicated. The , $2.4-million facility features state-of-the-art equipment, and is significantly larger than the former fitness center, Memorial Gymnasium.

The atrium of the Umbeck Science-Mathematics Center houses one of the few complete Fin whale skeletons on display in North America.

The centerpiece of campus is Old Main, &quot;the oldest building on its campus, and the best preserved site of one of the 1858 senatorial debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas&quot;, a National Historic Landmark and part of the National Register of Historic Places.

Built in 1928, the Seymour Library was ranked third &quot;Best Library&quot; in the nation by the Princeton Review in 2001. Inside its leaded glass windows and oak-paneled reading rooms, the library houses 350,000 books and more than 14,000 periodicals. Its special collections include the Finley Collection of Midwest History, the Strong Collection of 18th- and 19th-century maps and photographs, the Hughes Collection of manuscripts and first editions of Faulkner, Hemingway and his &quot;Lost Generation&quot; contemporaries, and an original Diderot Encyclopédie.

In 2002, a major curriculum revision called &quot;Renewed Knox&quot; was launched. With this revision came the creation of six new academic centers: The Center for Research and Advanced Studies, The Center for Global Studies, The Center for Career and Pre-Professional Development, The Center for Community Service, The Center for Teaching and Learning, and The Center for Intercultural Life.

Students established the Knox College Community Garden in 2007 as an independent study project. It continues to be tended by student volunteers, and produces a variety of annual and perennial vegetables and flowers.

== U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard ==
According to the U.S. Department of Education, 21% of students who started college at Knox College later transferred to another school. This compares to the national average of over 30% of students transferring colleges. 17% of the entering class did not return after their first year. This compares to a national average of 30% of college students who do not return after their first year. African Americans make up 13.4% of the U.S. population in general, about 8% of surrounding area, and they are 6% of the Knox College student body. Knox College graduates typically earn between $18,300 and $33,100, less than the average starting salary paid to college graduates, about $50,000, although there is great variation in both of these figures based on chosen majors and career paths. Knox alumni go into fields ranging from literature to neurosurgery. Furthermore, published earning data is skewed by the fact that a significant number of Knox students do not seek full time employment immediately after graduating from Knox, instead going on to pursue graduate degree programs, including PhDs, medical school, and law school, during which time work is delayed or only part time.

<text>Gone to Earth is the third solo studio album by English singer-songwriter David Sylvian, released on 1 September 1986 on Virgin Records. A double album, &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; is the follow-up to his debut record, &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot;, and peaked at No. 24 in the UK Albums Chart.

==History==
The album is a two-record set featuring one record of experimental rock songs with vocals and one consisting entirely of ambient instrumental tracks. Guest artists include Robert Fripp (who co-wrote three songs) and Bill Nelson (who co-wrote one). The album was recorded through 1985 and mid-1986 at Jam Studios in North London, Eel Pie Studios and at The Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, England, with producer Steve Nye. Sylvian said in 1987: &quot;I&#x27;d have liked to have recorded it all at Shipton Manor but we ran out of studio time. The rest of the album was done in Townhouse Studios, London. I find that most of the work that was completed in London was substandard compared to the work that was completed in Oxfordshire.&quot;

Initially, Sylvian started on a variety of different musical projects that didn&#x27;t have a specific direction. He composed the film soundtrack &quot;Steel Cathedrals&quot; and the work &quot;Words with the Shaman&quot;, and worked on the songs &quot;Wave&quot;, &quot;Before The Bullfight&quot; and &quot;Laughter And Forgetting&quot;, that added up to a body of work that he felt was an incoherent collection of material. He persuaded Virgin Records to release &quot;Words with the Shaman&quot; as a 12&quot; EP, and &quot;Steel Cathedrals&quot; was put aside for a video release only. Sylvian then concentrated on the songs he was working on with the intention to develop them and flesh it out to a full album. At the time, he was also writing short instrumental pieces and wanted to pursue them as well. Sylvian&#x27;s record company were not particularly interested in his instrumental compositions, and funded the recording only of the songs on Disc 1 of the set, with Sylvian funding and recording the instrumentals on Disc 2 in his own time.

Sylvian, as on his earlier solo albums, continued to reference artists, writers and thinkers who were influencing him, though here he utilised the technique of using, within certain songs, snippets of the voices of particular figures. These include Robert Graves and Joseph Beuys. &quot;Taking the Veil&quot; lifted its title and lyrical theme directly from Max Ernst book &quot;A Little Girl Dreams of Taking the Veil&quot;. The song &quot;Laughter and Forgetting&quot; was partly inspired by Milan Kundera&#x27;s novel &quot;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&quot;.

Recording his compositions, Sylvian collaborated with a number of musicians such as guitarists Robert Fripp and Bill Nelson, his brother Steve Jansen and Richard Barbieri from his earlier band Japan, jazz pianist John Taylor, bassist Ian Maidman, Kenny Wheeler and Harry Beckett on flugelhorns, saxophonist Mel Collins and pedal steel guitarist B.J. Cole. 

Initially Sylvian pushed for &quot;River Man&quot; as the albums lead single, but Virgin Records opted for the more uptempo &quot;Taking the Veil&quot; as the albums first single. It reached no. 53 on the UK Singles Chart during a four week chart run. The album was released on 13 September 1986 to critical acclaim and peaked at no. 24 in the UK albums chart. and has been certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 60,000 copies. &quot;Silver Moon&quot; was released as the second and last single from the album, briefly entering the UK chart for two weeks, peaking at no. 83 in October 1986. The original cover art by Russell Mills was largely inspired by Sylvian&#x27;s then-current interest in Rosicrucianism and Gnosticism, particularly the writings of Robert Fludd.

Original UK, US and Japanese CD pressings omit four of the instrumentals: &quot;Silver Moon Over Sleeping Steeples&quot;, &quot;Camp Fire: Coyote Country&quot;, &quot;A Bird of Prey Vanishes into a Bright Blue Cloudless Sky&quot; and &quot;Sunlight Seen Through Towering Trees&quot;. Later Japanese CD editions and the &quot;Weatherbox&quot; box set both included the complete album on two discs. In 2003, the album was re-released in a double-disc format that mirrors the original vinyl release, and included three bonus remixes, while shortening the intro to &quot;Before the Bullfight&quot;.

In February 2019, as part of a redesigned monochrome sleeved vinyl reissue batch of his 1980s material, &quot;Gone To Earth&quot; was released as a double album with a black-and-white picture of Sylvian replacing the original artwork.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Gone to Earth&quot; was well received by the contemporary British music press. &quot;Sounds&quot;&#x27; Chris Roberts praised the album: &quot;it&#x27;s the perfect realisation of artist converting image to mood, subverting fantasy to super-reality. Delicate, but with the strength of legions, it&#x27;s an Eighties masterpiece and conceivably his finest approximation of distilled beauty &quot;ever&quot;... [Gone to Earth] is almost as breathtaking as it is life giving.&quot;

<text>Holometabola (from Ancient Greek &quot;complete&quot; + &quot;change&quot;), also known as Endopterygota (from &quot;inner&quot; + &quot;wing&quot; + Neo-Latin &quot;-having&quot;), is a supra-ordinal clade of insects within the infraclass Neoptera that go through distinctive larval, pupal, and adult stages. They undergo a radical metamorphosis, with the larval and adult stages differing considerably in their structure and behaviour. This is called holometabolism, or complete metamorphism.

==Evolution==

The Holometabola constitute the most diverse insect superorder, with over 1 million living species divided between 11 orders, containing insects such as butterflies, flies, fleas, bees, ants, and beetles.

The earliest holometabolan fossils date from the Carboniferous.

The Holometabola are sometimes divided into three assemblages: Neuropterida (Neuroptera, Megaloptera, Raphidioptera, Strepsiptera and Coleoptera), Hymenopteroida (Hymenoptera), and Panorpida (Siphonaptera, Diptera, Trichoptera, Lepidoptera and Mecoptera).

Molecular analysis has clarified the group&#x27;s phylogeny, as shown in the cladogram.

==Description==
The Endopterygota are distinguished from the Exopterygota by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota (literally &quot;internal winged forms&quot;) develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage. Exopterygota (&quot;external winged forms&quot;) develop wings on the outside of their bodies and do not go through a pupal stage. The latter trait is plesiomorphic, however, as it is found also in groups such as Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), which are not Neoptera, but more basal among insects.

<text>BrMSX was an MSX emulator for DOS, written by Ricardo Bittencourt. It was first released in 1997, and at the time was regarded as the fastest, most accurate MSX emulator.

==History==
In 1997, MSX emulation was still preliminary. The only MSX emulators available were fMSX and CJS MSX. Neither were very accurate at the time, nor were they fast enough to run all MSX software at full speed, on computers of that era.

BrMSX aimed to solve these two problems. In order to improve accuracy, the Z80 core was tested using ZEXALL, emulating every aspect of the CPU, down to the undocumented flags. Fast emulation was achieved by coding the emulator entirely in Assembly, and by using a number of hacks, the most successful being a dirty rectangles implementation known as the &quot;video cache&quot;.

Development of BrMSX started in September 1997, and the first public release was in November of the same year. The name itself, &quot;BrMSX&quot; has a double meaning. The &quot;Br&quot; in the name is an allusion to Brazil, the country where it was coded, but the characters also are the initials of the author, Ricardo Bittencourt. The logo, created by Raul Tabajara, reflects both the MSX imagery (by using a font similar to the logo of the MSX game Aleste) and the Brazilian flag (by using the round shield with the Brazilian sky). The mouse icon used in the GUI was a rendition of the keyboard of Expert (one of the Brazilian MSX models).

Eventually, interest in BrMSX faded, as fewer people used DOS-compatible systems. A Windows port came out later, but the last release (v3.0.16) was in Dec of 2003, and included the source code is dated as Mar of 2005. The DOS version stopped at Feb of 2003 (v2.10).

In 2017, the author rescued some of the history of the project with release granularity and published it on a git repository.

A number of features now common in MSX emulation were first seen in BrMSX:

* Z80 core fully compliant with ZEXALL
* Support to MegaRAM
* Support to samples generated by the PSG, PPI, and Konami Majutsushi
* MSX2+ cross-lines animation
* Disk drive emulation through I/O ports
* Dir as Disk, mount directories in the host machine
* ADVRAM, a hardware prototype that was never released commercially
* Interactive debugger
* Multiplayer games (using a serial cable)
* Fast forward button, to skip game introductions
* Save states
* TV emulation (blur filters and scanlines)
* Green monitor emulation 
* Emulation of the LEDs (Caps Lock, Kana and the Disk Drive)

<doc id="799173" wikidata="Q464348" url="?curid=799173" title="Takehito Koyasu">
<text>is a Japanese voice actor from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. He is affiliated with and representative of T&#x27;s Factory, a voice acting agency he founded in October 1998. His son is also a voice actor. Koyasu has taken over many of the characters played by Kaneto Shiozawa after his death.

==Career==
When Koyasu was in junior high school, he, as an aspiring screen actor himself, was such a movie buff that he would watch movies every day without going to school. By chance, he saw the scene before Tetsurō Hoshino&#x27;s departure in &quot;Adieu Galaxy Express 999&quot; where a group of nameless soldiers take him on the 999 and send him on his way, and was impressed by it. This sparked his interest in voice acting, and since then it has been his policy to aim for &quot;three-dimensional acting.&quot; After graduating from high school, he entered a training school. In 1988, he made his voice acting debut in &quot;Wowser&quot;, and in 1989, he played his first regular character as Gai, the King Yaksha in &quot;Legend of Heavenly Sphere Shurato&quot;. Although he was a regular character in the series, he was in the position of a villain whose inner workings were rarely discussed in the story, so it was difficult for Koyasu to grasp the role and he had to do several dozen retakes for a single line. He later said that although his name recognition as a voice actor had increased, he did not feel like he was doing his best.

Afterwards, Koyasu played the role of Minos in the OVA &quot;Aries&quot; released in 1990. The OVA was based on a fantasy manga of the same name that was being serialized at the time, and the voice actors for the main characters were to be decided by a magazine reader&#x27;s vote. Since Koyasu had appeared in &quot;Shurato&quot; shortly before this, he had some recognition among the viewers, and he received the most votes for the role of Hades, the main character. However, at the time, Koyasu was still an unknown name in the voice acting industry, and the production members voiced their concerns about giving the lead role to a newcomer like Koyasu. As a result, the results of the readers&#x27; poll were rejected, and Koyasu was given the role of Hades&#x27; subordinate Minos, a role with little screentime.

In &quot;Tekkaman Blade&quot;, Koyasu played the main character&#x27;s rival, Tekkaman Evil (Shinya Aiba). Koyasu himself has often said in interviews that this is his favorite character, and after a period of sluggish performance, he put his voice acting career on the line to play the role, which ultimately led to his recovery. He also said that when he was playing the character, he thought he was really great, but when he watched the footage again later in life, he thought he was terrible at it, which led him to believe he was making progress.

In the late 1990s, Koyasu worked on conceptualizing for the media franchise &quot;Weiß Kreuz&quot;. He also formed the voice acting unit &quot;Weiß&quot; consisting of voice castmates Shin-ichiro Miki, Tomokazu Seki and Hiro Yūki, and became the first male voice actor to appear on the cover of a voice acting magazine and the first voice actor to make a music clip. In 2000–2001, he was active in music under the name ZAZEL.

After working as a member of Production Baobab (1988–1998), Koyasu established his own representative office, T&#x27;s Factory, in 1998. On May 5, 2020, on the occasion of his birthday, the official website and Twitter account of T&#x27;s Factory were opened, and his profile was also released at the same time.

In 2020, Koyasu made his first appearance with his son, voice actor Kōki Koyasu, in an advertisement for &quot;Duel Masters&quot;. In April, he and Kōki teamed up for their own radio show, &quot;Takehito &amp; Kōki&#x27;s KOYASU RADIO.&quot;

In 2021, he won the Best Actor in Supporting Role award at the 15th Seiyu Awards.

Koyasu&#x27;s name &quot;Takehito&quot; comes from the fact that his birthday is on Children&#x27;s Day. His motto is to &quot;make two-dimensional into three-dimensional.&quot; His hobby is writing novels and he professes to like video games. He has played every game he has appeared in, but he is not very good at action or shooting games.

<text>Billy Joe Royal (April 3, 1942 – October 6, 2015) was an American country soul singer. His most successful record was &quot;Down in the Boondocks&quot; in 1965.

==Life and career==

Born in Valdosta, Georgia, to Clarence and Mary Sue Smith Royal, and raised in Marietta, Georgia, Royal performed at the Georgia Jubilee in Atlanta during his teens. He formed his own rock and roll band, and became a local star at the Bamboo Ranch in Savannah in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where his singing style was influenced by African-American performers, including Sam Cooke.
Royal was a friend of performer and songwriter Joe South, and recorded what was intended as a demo of South&#x27;s song &quot;Down in the Boondocks&quot;. The recording was heard at Columbia Records, who offered Royal a singing contract in 1965 and released his version of the song, produced by South. &quot;Down in the Boondocks&quot; remained his best-known song, reaching number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 38 in the UK.

He followed up his initial success with the singles &quot;I Knew You When&quot; (Top 20, 1965) and &quot;Hush&quot; (1967), also written and produced by Joe South. Another South composition, &quot;Yo-Yo&quot;, just missed the top 40 in Canada and charted poorly in the U.S. when Royal released it in 1967, but a later remake by The Osmonds was a much greater success. His 1969 single, &quot;Cherry Hill Park&quot;, peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In the 1970s his recording of &quot;Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot; gained popularity among Northern soul enthusiasts and was regularly played in Northern soul nightclubs.

By the late 1970s, Royal had become a regular performer in Las Vegas, and also appeared as an actor in movies and on television. His last hit on the US pop charts was in 1978, when his version of &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; became a minor hit. However, he reinvented himself in the 1980s as a mainstream country star, and had his first hit on the country music chart in 1985 with &quot;Burned Like a Rocket&quot;, released on the Atlantic label. His other country hits included &quot;I&#x27;ll Pin a Note on Your Pillow&quot; (1987), &quot;Tell It Like It Is&quot;, and &quot;Till I Can&#x27;t Take It Anymore&quot; (both 1989). His successes on the country charts continued until the early 1990s.

Royal experienced a second comeback during the 2000s due to regular airplay on Country and Classic radio stations. His music was further exposed to younger generations through a movement known as The Beat Army, an online music forum based on Facebook which is operated by author and music producer Paul Collins. Royal continued to tour regularly, performing concerts at casinos, music festivals, and clubs in North America, Japan, and throughout Europe. His set lists included a mixture of songs representing multiple genres from the 1960s onwards. He also played Robert Ally in the indie Western film, &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (2013), co-starring country singer Cody McCarver.

Royal died in his sleep on October 6, 2015, at his home in Morehead City, North Carolina.

<text>Susanna (; : &quot;lily&quot;), also called Susanna and the Elders, is a narrative included in the Book of Daniel (as chapter 13) by the Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches and Eastern Orthodox Churches. It is one of the additions to Daniel, placed in the Apocrypha by Protestants, with Anabaptists, Lutherans, Anglicans and Methodists regarding it as non-canonical but useful for purposes of edification. The text is not included in the Jewish Tanakh and is not mentioned in early Jewish literature, although it does appear to have been part of the original Septuagint from the 2nd century BC, and was revised by Theodotion, a Hellenistic Jewish redactor of the Septuagint text ().

==Summary==

A fair Hebrew wife named Susanna bathes privately (having sent her attendants away) in her locked and walled garden. Two elders, having previously said goodbye to each other, bump into each other again when they spy on her bathing. The two men realize they both lust for Susanna. When she makes her way back to her house, they accost her, demanding she have sexual intercourse with them. When she refuses, they have her arrested, claiming that the reason she sent her maids away was to be alone as she was having intercourse with a young man under a tree. 

She refuses to be blackmailed and is arrested and about to be put to death for adultery when the young Daniel interrupts the proceedings, shouting that the elders should be interrogated to prevent the death of an innocent.

After being separated, the two men are cross-examined in detail about what they saw and contradict each other about the tree under which Susanna supposedly met her lover. In the Greek text, the names of the trees cited by the elders form puns with the sentences given by Daniel. The first says they were under a mastic tree (, ), and Daniel says that an angel stands ready to cut (, ) him in two. The second says they were under an evergreen oak tree (, ), and Daniel says that an angel stands ready to saw (, ) him in two.

The great difference in size between a mastic and an oak makes the elders&#x27; lie plain to all the observers. The false accusers are put to death, and virtue triumphs.

==Date and textual history==

The Greek text survives in two versions. The received version is due to Theodotion; this has superseded the original Septuagint version, which now survives only in Syriac translation, in Papyrus 967 (3rd century AD), and exceptionally in a single medieval manuscript, known as Codex Chisianus 88.
The Greek puns in the texts have been cited by some as proof that the text never existed in Hebrew or Aramaic, but other researchers have suggested pairs of words for trees and cutting that sound similar enough to suppose that they could have been used in an original. The Anchor Bible uses &quot;yew&quot; and &quot;hew&quot;, and &quot;clove&quot; and &quot;cleave&quot;, to get this effect in English.

Sextus Julius Africanus did not regard the story as canonical. Jerome (347–420), while translating the Vulgate, treated this section as a non-canonical fable.
In his introduction, he indicated that Susanna was an apocryphal addition because it was not present in the Hebrew text of Daniel. Origen received the story as part of the &#x27;divine books&#x27; and censured &#x27;wicked presbyters&#x27; who did not recognize its authenticity (&quot;Hom Lev 1.3.&quot;), remarking that the story was commonly read in the early Church (&quot;Letter to Africanus&quot;); and claimed the two Elders who had accused Susanna were Ahab ben Kolaiah and Zedekiah ben Masseiah, (Jeremiah 29:21); he also noted the story&#x27;s absence in the Hebrew text, observing (in &quot;Epistola ad Africanum&quot;) that it was &quot;hidden&quot; by the Jews in some fashion. Origen&#x27;s claim is reminiscent of Justin Martyr&#x27;s charge that Jewish scribes &#x27;removed&#x27; certain verses from their Scriptures (&quot;Dialogue with Trypho: C.71-3&quot;). Although omitted from current Jewish scripture, the story of Susanna is acknowledged to have been part of Jewish tradition in the Second Temple period.

==Depictions in art==

The story is portrayed on the Lothair Crystal, an engraved rock crystal made in the Lotharingia region of northwest Europe in the mid 9th century, now in the British Museum.

The story was frequently painted from about 1470. Susanna is the subject of paintings by many artists, including (but not limited to) Lorenzo Lotto (&quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot;, 1517), Guido Reni, Rubens, Van Dyck (&quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot;), Tintoretto, Rembrandt, Tiepolo, and Artemisia Gentileschi (&quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot;, 1610). Some treatments, especially in the Baroque period, emphasize the drama, others concentrate on the nude; a 19th-century version by Francesco Hayez (National Gallery, London) has no elders visible at all. The Uruguayan painter Juan Manuel Blanes also painted two versions of the story, most notably one where the two voyeurs are not in sight, and Susanna looks to her right with a concerned expression on her face.

In 1681 Alessandro Stradella wrote an oratorio in two parts &quot;La Susanna&quot; for Francesco II, Duke of Modena, based upon the story.

In 1749, George Frideric Handel wrote an English-language oratorio &quot;Susanna&quot;.

Susanna (and not Peter Quince) is the subject of the 1915 poem &quot;Peter Quince at the Clavier&quot; by Wallace Stevens, which has been set to music by the American composer Dominic Argento and by the Canadian Gerald Berg.

American artist Thomas Hart Benton (1889–1975) painted a modern Susanna in 1938, now at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. He consciously included pubic hair, unlike the statue-like images of classical art. The fable was set during the Great Depression, and Benton included himself as one of the voyeurs.

The Belgian writer Marnix Gijsen borrows elements of the story in his first novel &quot;Het boek van Joachim van Babylon&quot;, 1947.

Pablo Picasso, too, rendered the subject in the mid-twentieth century, depicting Susanna much as he depicts his other less abstract reclining nudes. The elders are depicted as paintings hanging on the wall behind her. The picture, painted in 1955, is part of the permanent collection at the Museo Picasso Málaga.

The American opera &quot;Susannah&quot; by Carlisle Floyd, which takes place in the American South of the 20th century, is also inspired by this story, with the addition of a traveling preacher who seduces Susannah.

Shakespeare refers to this biblical episode in the trial scene of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, where Shylock praises Portia as being &quot;A second Daniel&quot; because of her sound judgments, a compliment then taken up by Gratiano when she rules against Shylock. (Note that this story is not part of the Jewish Book of Daniel, meaning that Shylock should probably be unfamiliar with it.) Shakespeare is assumed to have named his eldest daughter after the biblical character.

The story is also repeated in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; under the name &quot;The Devout Woman and the Two Wicked Elders&quot;.

<doc id="799210" wikidata="Q3632440" url="?curid=799210" title="Baby Huey">
<text>Baby Huey is a gigantic and naïve duckling cartoon character. He was created by Martin Taras for Paramount Pictures&#x27; Famous Studios, and became a Paramount cartoon star during the 1950s. Huey first appeared in &quot;Quack-a-Doodle-Doo&quot;, a Paramount &quot;Noveltoon&quot; theatrical short produced in 1949 and released in 1950.

==Famous Studios==

Huey first appeared onscreen in the &quot;Noveltoons&quot; short &quot;Quack-a-Doodle-Doo&quot;, released in theaters on March 3, 1950. The character&#x27;s voice was provided by Sid Raymond, an actor and comedian who created several other voices for Famous Studios&#x27; characters, including Katnip from Herman and Katnip. Eleven Baby Huey cartoons were produced between 1951 and 1959.

Many animated shorts featuring Huey had recurring themes. Most common among them was him trying to be just like any other kid his age. He would see his peers playing, and would immediately get excited. However, whenever he tried to involve himself in the activities of his peers (also anthropomorphic ducklings), he would often inadvertently cause problems at their expense, and as a result they would drive him away through trickery (and into tears). A hungry fox (voiced by Jackson Beck) would show up, originally intending to eat Huey&#x27;s peers, but upon seeing Huey as a bigger meal and overhearing the distraught duck&#x27;s desires to play with someone, would feign friendship and set traps along the way, all of which would prove ineffective on Huey and/or backfire on the fox. At first, Huey was blissfully unaware of the fox&#x27;s true agenda, but as his peers watched the annoyed fox in action from a safe distance (and fearing for &quot;his&quot; safety just as they did their own), Huey would come to realize the truth about his predator and dispose of him, usually by saying: &quot;Hey, you! You&#x27;re the fox! And I think you&#x27;re trying to kill me!&quot;, and would finish the fox. Other times, however, Huey would remain blissfully unaware and the exasperated fox would finally give up, fleeing Baby Huey before any more misfortune befell him. In the end, Huey&#x27;s peers would make amends for their previous attitudes towards him and happily include him in their activities.

Baby Huey had a sidekick in later comics. This was his slow-thinking cousin, whom he referred to as Cousin Dimwit. Dimwit was characterized as a fairly skinny duck in an oversized red woolen sweater, with sleeves that ran over his hands and hung down several inches.

==Harvey Comics and later animated appearances==
Baby Huey made a comic book debut in &quot;Little Audrey&quot; #25, 1952, by Harvey Comics. &quot;Harvey Comics Hits&quot; #60 was the second Harvey-published comic book to feature the character.

The 1956 comic &quot;Baby Huey, the Baby Giant&quot; was the first to bear the character&#x27;s name; it ran for 99 issues until 1972. The spin-off &quot;Baby Huey and Papa&quot; lasted for 33 issues (1962–1968), and &quot;Baby Huey in Duckland&quot; for 15 issues (1962–1966).

Huey&#x27;s parents, Papa and Mama Duck (Gilbert &amp; Silly), always struggled to manage their overgrown son despite his overbearing weight and strength, which often resulted in damage to his family&#x27;s house or car, injury to Papa, or a threat from Papa&#x27;s boss to fire him if Huey harmed the boss or caused damage to his home or office. Papa often disparaged Huey (who remained oblivious to his disapproval). Huey&#x27;s main sidekicks were small identical triplet ducks (who bore a striking resemblance to Donald Duck&#x27;s nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie) who resented or mocked Huey for his stupidity and clumsiness but depended on his superhero strength to get them out of trouble.

Characters who appeared in Baby Huey comic books in separate strips included Herman and Katnip and Buzzy the Funny Crow, who was always outsmarting a blue cat (who resembled Katnip) that tried to catch and eat him.

Harvey purchased the rights to all of Famous&#x27;s original characters in 1959, and Huey continued to appear regularly in Harvey publications until 1972. Huey was rarely seen for nearly two decades afterward, returning to comics in 1990.

Originally, Baby Huey was intended to appear as a cameo in the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; in the deleted scene &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot;.

Carbunkle Cartoons produced a new series of Baby Huey cartoons for television in 1994, which aired as &quot;The Baby Huey Show&quot; for two seasons. Sid Raymond reprised his role but was later replaced with Joe Alaskey, once the production was taken over by Film Roman.

He also starred in a live-action direct-to-video film, &quot;Baby Huey&#x27;s Great Easter Adventure&quot;, in 1999, voiced by Stephen Furst (who also directed the film) and portrayed physically by Rodger Bumpass (who had a cameo in this film).

U.S. President Bill Clinton in a 1993 conversation cited his similarities to Baby Huey: &quot;I&#x27;m a lot like Baby Huey. I&#x27;m fat. I&#x27;m ugly. But if you push me down, I keep coming back&quot;.

In &quot;The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper&quot; segment entitled &quot;Legend of Duh Bigfoot&quot;, Baby Huey makes a cameo at the end of that segment. In &quot;Harvey Girls Forever&quot;, Baby Huey makes cameo appearances in the third and fourth seasons as a Horn-a-Corn costume He makes a brief cameo in the final episode Harvey Endings as mutant Duck baby in a sewer

The documentary &quot;Hype!&quot; references Baby Huey, by comparing it to different music revolutions that hit different cities at random times.

<doc id="799214" wikidata="Q327348" url="?curid=799214" title="Mount Gambier">
<text>Mount Gambier is the second most populated city in South Australia, with a population of 31,308 as of the 2021 census. The city is located on the slopes of Mount Gambier, a volcano in the south east of the state, about south-east of the capital Adelaide and just from the Victorian border. The traditional owners of the area are the Bungandidj (or Buandik) people. Mount Gambier is the most important settlement in the Limestone Coast region and the seat of government for both the City of Mount Gambier and the District Council of Grant.

The city is well known for its geographical features, particularly its volcanic and limestone features, most notably Blue Lake/Waawor/Warwar, and its parks, gardens, caves and sinkholes.

==History==
Before British colonisation of South Australia, the Bungandidj (or Buandik/Boandik) people were the original Aboriginal inhabitants of the area. They referred to the peak of the volcanic mountain as &#x27;ereng balam&#x27; or &#x27;egree belum&#x27;, meaning &#x27;home of the eagle hawk&#x27;, but the mountain itself was called Berrin. A sinkhole in the township was referred to as &quot;thu-ghee&quot;.

The peak of the dormant Mount Gambier crater was sighted in 1800 by Lieutenant James Grant from the survey brig, HMS Lady Nelson, and named after Lord James Gambier, Admiral of the Fleet. It was the first place named by the British in what was later to become the colony of South Australia. The peak is marked by Centenary Tower, built in 1901 to commemorate the first sighting by colonists.

In 1839, Stephen Henty, one of the Henty brothers who occupied large landholdings at Portland and Merino, led an overland expedition to explore the Mount Gambier region. He was the first white man to climb the peak and view the blue crater lake.

The Henty brothers subsequently laid claim to Mount Gambier in 1842 and established a sheep station there. Conflict with the local Aboriginal residents quickly ensued that same year with Henty&#x27;s men shooting a number and burning their corpses. In March 1844, a band of Aboriginal people led by Koort Kirrup took a large number of Henty&#x27;s sheep. Henty&#x27;s men pursued and engaged them in a prolonged skirmish which resulted in the colonists having to retreat. 

Other British pastoralists and their shepherds in the region were being robbed, speared and murdered by the local Aboriginal population and they proposed to form hunting parties to shoot them indiscriminately. After the Aboriginal population destroyed between 200 and 300 sheep, the Henty brothers were forced to abandon the Mount Gambier property later in 1844 with significant loss of capital.

Evelyn Sturt, the brother of the explorer Charles Sturt soon took up the leasehold, establishing himself at nearby Compton and bringing 500 cattle and 3000 sheep to pasture at Mount Gambier. Sturt claimed he was able to control the Bungandidj people by &quot;a good rifle aimed by a correct eye&quot;. In May 1845, seven armed colonists pursued Aboriginal groups after livestock were taken. In late 1845, the first police station at Mount Gambier was formed. In 1846, the South Australian Mounted Police were involved in an affray with the Aborigines, shooting one and wounding another two. 

In 1847, Aboriginal people speared cattle and threatened to spear Sturt. Subsequently, Corporal McCulloch and his troopers went on a mission to disperse them. In November, two police and three men tracked a group of Aboriginal people who had taken about 300 sheep to the coast. In their attempt to handcuff them, spears were thrown at them, and during the ensuring fight, four were shot dead.

Industries soon began to appear. The Post Office opened on 22 September 1846, an Afro-American named John Byng built the Mount Gambier Hotel in 1847, and Dr Edward Wehl arrived in 1849 to begin a flour-milling operation.
Hastings Cunningham founded &quot;Gambierton&quot; in 1854 by subdividing a block of . From 1861 to 1878, the Post Office was known by this name before reverting to Mount Gambier. Local government appeared in 1863 when Dr Wehl, who now owned a substantial millhouse on Commercial Road, was elected chairman of the District Council of Mount Gambier. In December 1864, this became the District Council of Mount Gambier West and, at the same time, a separate District Council of Mount Gambier East was formed.

Incorporation in 1876 saw a further division, with the creation of the Town Council and Mr John Watson elected Mayor. Mount Gambier was governed in this fashion until 1932, when the District Council of East and West merged to form a single District Council of Mount Gambier once more.

On 9 December 1954, Mount Gambier was officially declared a city, and is now an important tourism centre in south-east South Australia.

, the town has not been officially dual-named, but the lakes and several other culturally significant features of the location were given dual names in February 2022, and dual naming is being planned for the city, mostly likely as Berrin, the name by which it is known to the local Indigenous community.

Mount Gambier&#x27;s urban area is located mainly along the northern slopes and plain of a maar volcano of the same name, Mount Gambier. Comprising several craters, it is part of the Newer Volcanics Province complex of volcanoes. One of these contains a huge lake of high-quality artesian drinking water which changes colour with the seasons. In winter, it is a steel grey and then changes to a spectacular cobalt blue in the summer, giving rise to its name, Blue Lake. 

This deep lake accommodates a range of unusual aquatic flora and fauna, in particular fields of large stromatolites. There are several other craters in the city including Valley Lake and the Leg of Mutton River. The region surrounding the city includes other volcanic features such as Mount Schank, along with many karst features such as water-filled caves, cenotès and sinkholes.

The city’s metropolitan area includes the following suburbs: Mount Gambier CBD (inner-city suburb), Suttontown (north-western suburb), Wandilo (north-western suburb), Mil-Lel (northern suburb), Worrolong (north-eastern suburb), Glenburnie (eastern suburb), Yahl (south-eastern suburb), Compton (western suburb), Moorak (southern suburb), Square Mile (south-eastern suburb), and OB Flat (south-eastern suburb).

Mount Gambier has only 40.5 clear days on an annual basis. Summer and annual mean temperatures are very cool for the latitude, being exposed to the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot;. Extreme summer minima near are especially of note, as these are unheard-of in northern hemisphere locations at a similar latitude and near the coast at sea level. The last occurrences of snow in the city were in 1951 and 1932.

==Governance==

Mount Gambier is the seat of local government for the City of Mount Gambier. The Council Chamber is in the Civic Centre at 10 Watson Terrace. In September 1875 a public meeting was held by ratepayers to discuss the creation of a municipality. The first town council was created on the 25th May 1876 with local newspaper editor John Watson elected mayor. In 1932 the Town Council area was enlarged and the two surrounding district councils merged.

A declaration by Governor Sir Robert George on the 9th December 1954 announced Mount Gambier was now a city. City status is achieved by reaching a population of 10,000 people. An Act of Parliament in 1953 changed the qualification from 20,000 residents to 10,000 residents. The Town Council of Mount Gambier was assigned the new name The Corporation of the City of Mount Gambier and official celebrations were held on the 17th January 1955.

The city consists of a mayor and ten councillors, elected equally from the East and West wards once every four years by postal voting. The Mayor of Mount Gambier council is Lynette Martin. The local government area is situated entirely within the District Council of Grant and due to the city&#x27;s growth there have been ongoing talks of amalgamation, the most recent boundary changes taking place in 2010.

Law and order for the Limestone Coast region is maintained via the Mount Gambier Police Complex at 42 Bay Road Mount Gambier, the Mount Gambier Magistrates Court at 41 Bay Road Mount Gambier and the Mount Gambier Prison at Moorak south of the city.

In state politics, Mount Gambier is located in the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Mount Gambier, which has been held since 2014 by former Liberal Party member Troy Bell, who was re-elected as an independent in the 2018 state election.

Mount Gambier also has two local representatives in the State Parliament’s Legislative Council being Liberal Ben Hood and Labor’s Clare Scriven.

In federal politics, Mount Gambier is located in the Australian House of Representatives division of Barker, which has been represented by Tony Pasin since 2013. It is a safe Liberal Party of Australia seat.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census, the population of the Mount Gambier census area was 26,878 people, making it the largest urban area in the state outside Adelaide. Approximately 52% of the population were female, 82.8% were Australian born, over 91.5% of residents were Australian citizens and 2.8% were indigenous.

The most popular industries for employment were Log Sawmilling and Timber Dressing (8%), School Education (4.8%) and Retail Trade (3.8%), while the unemployment rate is approx. 7%. The median weekly household income is A$814 or more per week, compared with $924 in Adelaide.

In the 2021 Census, 52.0% of residents identified themselves as having &#x27;No Religion&#x27;. The largest religious denominations represented were Catholics at 14.4%, Anglicans at 6.1%, and Uniting Church at 4.3%.

A 1976 study found that less than 10 per cent (around 160 people) of residents aged over 65 had lived in the area for less than 5 years, leading to a lack of specific aged-care facilities. The same source claimed &quot;The government in the south-east area of the state, consisting of three local councils, amounted to a single administration. In consequence, many residents of Victoria used to look across the border to Mount Gambier as their centre. Consequently, during the 1970s many elderly locals relocated to Victor Harbor and Moonta, both rural areas but with more resources available to cope with an ageing population&quot;.

==Economy==
The economy of Mount Gambier is driven by all three economic sectors, though it has emerged as a regional service economy with its main industry being the service industry and its key areas of business including tourism, hospitality, retail, professional services, government administration and education.

Historically, the town was served by multiple newspapers. Two earlier papers, the biweekly &quot;Mount Gambier Standard&quot; (3 May 1866 – 1874), and the &quot;South Eastern Star&quot; (2 October 1877 – 13 October 1930), were taken over by &quot;The Border Watch&quot;. Another, the &quot;South-Eastern Ensign&quot; (2 July 1875 – 30 June 1876), was also briefly printed. Later, a free commercial paper, the &quot;Exchange&quot; (1902 – 8 October 1942) ran in opposition to the &quot;Watch&quot;, and was published by the Clark family. However, it ceased when the Second World War caused paper restrictions and a decline in advertising.

<text>ABX Air, Inc., formerly Airborne Express, is a cargo airline headquartered at Wilmington Air Park near the City of Wilmington, Ohio, US. ABX Air operates scheduled, ad hoc charter and ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance and Insurance) freight services. It also provides flight support services and training. ABX Air is owned by Air Transport Services Group.

ABX Air&#x27;s main customer is DHL, and the majority of the freight it carries is for that company. Many of ABX Air&#x27;s aircraft are painted with DHL&#x27;s yellow and red livery.

ABX also operated cargo flights on behalf of Air Jamaica between Miami and the two Jamaican cities of Montego Bay (Donald Sangster International Airport) and Kingston (Norman Manley International Airport). One of their Boeing 767-200s routinely handled the flights, replacing the Douglas DC-8 types that flew previously. The aircraft flew with an Air Jamaica callsign of &quot;Jamaica&quot;.

== History ==
The airline was established in when Airborne Freight Corporation acquired Midwest Air Charter; operations started later that year. Airborne Express, as the airline was initially named, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Airborne Freight Corporation of Seattle. Apart from its core activity of cargo transportation, Airborne Express also performed airframe maintenance services to a number of aircraft types. At the company had 5,500 employees. In , the company acquired Boeing 767 aircraft for conversion to freighters.

ABX became a public company on August 16, 2003, as part of the merger of DHL and Airborne, in which DHL kept Airborne&#x27;s ground operations and spun off its air operations as ABX Air Inc. ABX Air&#x27;s common shares were traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol ABXA. In early 2007, ABX Air entered an ACMI agreement with All Nippon Airways to begin flying freight within Asia. The contract utilized two Boeing 767-200SF aircraft. In March 2007, the airline had 7,600 employees.
On November 2, 2007, CEO Joe Hete and the ABX Air board of directors announced that the company had entered into an agreement to acquire Cargo Holdings International, the parent company of Air Transport International (ATI) and Capital Cargo International Airlines for a cost of $350 million. The transaction was finalized on December 31, 2007, and ABX Air was reorganized as a subsidiary of a holding company, later named Air Transport Services Group (ATSG).
On November 10, 2008, ABX Air&#x27;s largest customer, DHL, announced a plan to exit the United States domestic market. Previous plans by DHL had been to keep its U.S. operations by contracting them out to United Parcel Service. On March 30, 2010, ABX Air&#x27;s parent company, ATSG, entered into new long-term agreements with DHL, under which ABX Air would continue providing airlift for the U.S. portion of DHL&#x27;s international network.

== Fleet ==

, the ABX Air fleet consists of the following aircraft:

*On December 22, 1996, an Airborne Express DC-8-63F operating as Flight 827 conducted a test flight after undergoing modifications at Piedmont Triad International Airport. While performing a stall test the airplane entered into a real stall and the flight crew was unable to recover before it crashed into mountainous terrain near Narrows, Virginia. All six occupants were killed.
*On June 29, 2008, a Boeing 767 parked at San Francisco International Airport was damaged beyond repair by a fire that broke out as it was being prepared for flight. An investigation by the NTSB revealed that a design fault was to blame for the fire, allowing a short circuit between electric wiring and an electrically conductive component of the oxygen system.

<doc id="799219" wikidata="Q756749" url="?curid=799219" title="1982 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1982 Atlantic hurricane season was an extremely inactive Atlantic hurricane season with five named tropical storms and one subtropical storm. Two storms became hurricanes, one of which reached major hurricane status. The season officially began on June 1, 1982, and lasted until November 30, 1982. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. Activity started early with Hurricane Alberto forming on the first day of the season. Alberto threatened the Southwestern Florida coast as a tropical storm, meadering offshore in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and causing 23 fatalities in Cuba. The next system, a subtropical storm, formed later in June and affected the same area as Alberto, causing $10 million in damage.

Tropical Storm Beryl formed on August 28, after a quiet July in the open Atlantic Ocean. Beryl grazed Cape Verde, killing 3 people. Tropical Depression Three formed just behind Beryl, tracking east and north of the Caribbean sea in early September. Soon after the dissipation of Beryl, Tropical Storm Chris formed in the Gulf of Mexico on September 9. Chris stayed a weak storm, making landfall near Sabine Pass, Texas, and dissipating over land on September 13. Hurricane Debby was the next storm and the strongest of the season. The formative stage of Debby produced rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing one death on the island, and soon strengthened into a Category 4 major hurricane. Debby passed by Newfoundland on September 18 and merged with a non-tropical low on September 20. In mid-September, Tropical Depression Six formed west of Africa, and tracked west-northwest, dissipating before reaching the Leeward Islands on September 20. Its remnant thunderstorm activity continued moving west-northwest, forming Tropical Depression Seven which moved near Bermuda on September 25 before dissipating offshore Nova Scotia. The final storm of the season, Tropical Storm Ernesto, was the shortest-lasting system and stayed out to sea, dissipating on October 3.

== Season summary ==

The season was very inactive because of strong vertical wind shear due to stronger than normal westerly winds aloft. The wind shear was contributed by a variety of factors including a very strong El Niño. Vertical wind shear was strong enough to disrupt convection in areas of disturbed weather so they could not develop further. The El Niño which affected this hurricane season extended into the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season. Higher than average values of African mineral dust during the most active portion of the hurricane season could have also suppressed tropical cyclone activity.
The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 32, which is classified as &quot;below normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Although officially, subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total, the figure above includes periods when fully tropical storms were in a subtropical phase.

== Systems ==
=== Hurricane Alberto ===
On June 1, a tropical depression formed off western Cuba from an organized cloud system. It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto traveled generally northeast on an erratic course, and briefly intensified to a Category 1 hurricane, one of the earliest hurricanes of June, and the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Due to strengthening vertical wind shear, Alberto then quickly weakened into a tropical storm, doubled back to the west, and dissipated near the Florida Keys on June 6. Alberto is an example of a storm to enter the Gulf of Mexico and dissipating while never making landfall, which is an unusual event.

Though the storm never made landfall, 23 deaths were reported in Cuba from significant flooding, the worst in 32 years. Southern Florida experienced moderate rainfall, with a peak of occurring in Tavernier.
=== Subtropical Storm One ===
The first subtropical storm of the season formed in the east-central Gulf of Mexico on June 18, and moved northeast for its entire life cycle. It crossed the Florida peninsula that night, causing the issuance of numerous severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings. The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at eight miles (13 km) southwest of DeSoto County, Florida. The storm continued, crossing the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and retained its strength until June 20 when it became extratropical near Newfoundland. The cyclone caused three deaths in Florida, sank a fishing trawler off the coast of North Carolina, and caused $10 million in damage (1982 USD). This was the only subtropical or tropical cyclone to impact the Eastern seaboard this season.
=== Tropical Storm Beryl ===
A well-developed tropical wave exited Africa on August 27. The next day, it developed into a tropical depression, and shortly thereafter it intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. On August 29, it passed just south of Cape Verde as it continued intensifying on its west-northwest track. An eye feature appeared in the convection on August 31, suggesting winds of near hurricane status; since the feature was located on the western side of the deep convection and the storm was slightly asymmetric, the intensity was held just below hurricane status. Shortly after, strong wind shear caused the storm to deteriorate, leaving the low-level circulation exposed on the western side. Beryl weakened to a tropical depression the next day due to the lack of convection, and it continued westward without redevelopment. On September 5, a reconnaissance flight into the depression found winds of ; this was deemed unrepresentative of the actual intensity as it was recorded in a squall line. The depression became disorganized once more and by September 6, it was no longer identifiable on satellites.

Early in its duration, Tropical Storm Beryl produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds on the Cape Verde island of Sal. The storm caused moderate damage across the archipelago, totaling $3 million (1982 USD). The passage of Beryl resulted in three casualties in Brava Island, as well as 122 injuries. In the period after the storm&#x27;s passage, the United States provided humanitarian aid and economic assistance to the country, helping the archipelago to reverse the effects of Beryl.
=== Tropical Depression Three ===

This system formed east of the Lesser Antilles on September 6 to the southeast of Tropical Storm Beryl in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. The depression moved northeast of the Leeward Islands during the afternoon of September 7 while experiencing southwest vertical wind shear, and moved into the southwest North Atlantic before dissipating east of the Bahamas on September 9.
=== Tropical Storm Chris ===
A surface low-pressure area developed on September 8 in the Gulf of Mexico. It drifted westward, and the next day it organized into a subtropical depression. Under the influence of a trough of low pressure, the depression turned northward, and after steadily becoming better organized it transitioned into Tropical Storm Chris by late on September 10. The storm attained peak winds of before moving ashore near Sabine Pass in Texas. Chris continued inland until it dissipated over central Arkansas on September 13. Prior to making landfall, as many as 6,500 people evacuated from southern Louisiana, while offshore many oil workers were evacuated inland.

Chris produced moderate rainfall along its path, peaking at in Delhi, Louisiana, with totals of over in Mississippi and Tennessee. The rainfall caused locally severe flooding as far inland as Tennessee and Kentucky, with flooding of some rivers reported. The storm spawned nine tornadoes, of which four were F2 or stronger on the Fujita scale. Upon moving ashore, the hurricane produced a to storm tide, resulting in severe damage to several boats in the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout its path, damage totaled $2 million (1982 USD).
=== Hurricane Debby ===
A tropical wave moved westward offshore the coast of Africa. The wave traveled across the Atlantic, and organized into a tropical depression off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic on September 13. The depression turned north and strengthened into Tropical Storm Debby on September 14 and then a hurricane early the next day. Debby moved north-northeast, pass just east of Bermuda. Debby continued strengthening as it moved north, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). The storm weakened significantly before passing to the southeast of Newfoundland on September 18, by which time Debby was a Category 2. The storm accelerated and began weakening over the colder waters of the north Atlantic. Debby became extratropical over the far north Atlantic and merged with a strong non-tropical system which was developing over British Isles on September 20.

The precursor disturbance to Debby dropped heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at in the southwestern portion of the island. Consequently, some rivers and streams overflowed and landslides occurred, while floodwaters entered some businesses and homes in Guayanilla. One person died after the car he was a passenger accidentally drove into a overflowing stream. Wind gusts on Bermuda approached 70 mph (110 km/h), leaving minor damage. Debby had little effect on Atlantic Canada, outside of heavy rainfall. Tropical storm-force winds were also recorded at Cape Race. A storm development related to Debby left two dead in Finland.
=== Tropical Depression Six ===

This tropical depression formed west of the Cape Verde Islands on September 16, and moved west-northwest across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The system moved within east of the Leeward Islands before dissipating on September 20.
=== Tropical Depression Seven ===

The remnant area of disturbed weather from Tropical Depression Six continued moving west-northwest into the southwest north Atlantic. A tropical depression formed from this area west of Bermuda on September 25. The system recurved off the north and northeast, dissipating in north Atlantic shipping lanes southeast of Nova Scotia on September 27.
=== Tropical Storm Ernesto ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 23. The west side of the wave expanded and was designated Tropical Depression Eight on September 30. The depression intensified, making a sharp turn on October 1. A reconnaissance flight found winds with a pressure of and the depression was given the name Ernesto. A second reconnaissance flight on October 1 recorded sustained winds of with a pressure of . However, on October 2, Ernesto rapidly weakened and by the next day, the cyclone became unidentifiable after merging with an extratropical low. Ernesto never approached land and caused no reported damage.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1982. Each name used this season was utilized for the first time, except for the name &quot;Debby&quot; as it has previously been used on the old naming lists, but spelled as &quot;Debbie&quot;. No names were retired from this list following the season, thus it was used again for the 1988 season. 

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1982 USD.

<text>The saker falcon (&quot;Falco cherrug&quot;) is a large falcon species. It breeds from Central Europe eastwards across the Palearctic to Manchuria. It is a partial migrant, which means that some part of the population is migratory, some part is not. In Europe, for example, a part of the juveniles are migrating, while adults are mostly resident. The European and West Asian migratory sakers spend the winter in the Sahel region. On migration, they cross the Middle East, the Arabian Peninsula, and Pakistan, where they are exposed to illegal trapping. The migratory birds to the east from Altai Mountains spend the winter in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

The saker falcon is the second fastest bird in level flight after the white-throated needletail swift (unconfirmed), capable of reaching . It is also the third fastest animal in the world overall after the peregrine falcon and the golden eagle, with all three species capable of executing high speed dives known as &quot;stooping&quot;, approaching . The saker falcon is the national bird of Hungary, the United Arab Emirates, and Mongolia. It is called by Arabs &quot;Hur&quot;, i.e., &quot;Free-bird&quot;, and it has been used in falconry in the Arabian Peninsula since ancient times. Saker falcons are the national bird of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Yemen and have been integral to Arab heritage and culture for over 9,000 years. They are the national emblem of many Arab countries.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
This species belongs to the close-knit hierofalcon complex. In this group, there is ample evidence for rampant hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting which confounds analyses of DNA sequence data to a massive extent; molecular studies with small sample sizes can simply not be expected to yield reliable conclusions in the entire hierofalcon group. The radiation of the entire living diversity of hierofalcons seems to have taken place in the Eemian interglacial at the start of the Late Pleistocene, a mere 130,000–115,000 years ago; the saker falcon represents a lineage that expanded out of northeastern Africa into the interior of southeastern Europe and Asia, by way of the eastern Mediterranean region.

The Saker Falcon has four officially recognized subspecies in the international ornithology according to IOC World Bird List:
* &quot;F.c. cherrug&quot; - the nominate subspecies distributed from Central Europe to Central Asia;
* &quot;F.c. coatsi&quot; - a subspecies of the desert regions of West and South Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan;
* &quot;F.c. milvipes&quot; - the typical subspecies widespread in most parts of Central Asia;
* &quot;F.c. hendersoni&quot; - the subspecies of high elevations of Tibet and the Qinghai Plateau.
Some saker falcons at the northeast edge of the range in the Altai Mountains are slightly larger, and darker and more heavily spotted on the underparts. These, known as the Altai falcon, have been treated in the past either as a distinct species &quot;Falco altaicus&quot; or as a hybrid between saker falcon and gyrfalcon. However, modern opinion (e.g. ) treats them as a form of saker falcons and new research in population genetics and ecology supports that view. According to a recent study, Altai falcons are genetically intermingled with the broader Asian Saker population and do not constitute a distinct cluster, indicating that they are only colour morphs, and do not represent a separate taxonomic entity.

In captivity, lanners and sakers can interbreed, and gyrfalcon-saker hybrids are also available (see bird flu experiment described in &quot;Ecology and status&quot;).
The specific name, &quot;cherrug&quot;, comes from the Sindhi name &quot;charg&quot; for a female saker. The common name &quot;saker&quot; comes from the () meaning &quot;falcon&quot;.

==Description==
The saker falcon is a large hierofalcon, larger than the lanner falcon and almost as large as gyrfalcon at length with a wingspan of . Males weigh between and females . It resembles a larger but browner Gyrfalcon. It is larger and more heavily built than the related Lanner Falcon.

Saker falcons tend to have variable plumage. Males and females are similar, except in size, as are young birds, although these tend to be darker and more heavily streaked. The call is a sharp &quot;kiy-ee&quot; or a repeated &quot;kyak-kyak-kyak&quot;.

==Ecology==
The saker falcon is a raptor of open grasslands preferably with some trees or cliffs. It often hunts by horizontal pursuit, rather than the peregrine&#x27;s stoop from a height, and feeds mainly on rodents and birds. In Europe, ground squirrels and feral pigeons are the most common prey items. This species usually builds no nest of own, but lays its 3–6 eggs in an old stick nest in a tree which was previously used by other birds such as storks, ravens or buzzards. It also often nests on cliffs.

Saker nests support a species-rich assemblage of commensal insects.

==Status and conservation==
BirdLife International categorises this bird as endangered, due to a rapid population decline, particularly on the central Asian breeding grounds. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United Arab Emirates have been the main destination for thousands of falcons caught and sold illegally for hefty sums at the black market. Kazakhstan is estimated to lose up to 1,000 saker falcons per year.

The species also faces pressure from habitat loss and destruction. The population was estimated to be between 7,200 and 8,800 mature individuals in 2004. However, sakers live at low densities across large ranges in remote regions, making distribution status difficult to assess. A climatic niche modelling study pinpointed certain remote areas for targeted population surveys. In the United States, Canada and Europe there are several captive breeding projects. The most dramatic decline of the saker falcon in Asia has been in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In contrast, a strongly protected and relatively abundant population persists in Hungary.

Saker falcons are known to be very susceptible to avian influenza, individuals having been found infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 (in Saudi Arabia) and H7N7 (in Italy) strains. Therefore, an experiment was done with hybrid gyr-saker falcons, which found that five falcons vaccinated with a commercial H5N2 influenza vaccine survived infection with a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, whereas five unvaccinated falcons died. This means that sakers could be protected from bird flu by vaccination, at least in captivity.

==In culture==
A Hungarian mythological bird, the Turul, was probably a saker falcon (&quot;kerecsensólyom&quot;), and the saker falcon is the national bird of Hungary. In 2012, the saker falcon was selected as the national bird of Mongolia.

===Use in falconry===
The saker falcon has been used in falconry for thousands of years, and like its very close relative, the gyrfalcon, is a highly regarded in it. Swift and powerful, it is effective against medium-sized to large-sized game bird species. Saker falcons can reach speeds of 120 to 150 km/h and suddenly swoop down on their prey. The saker falcon and peregrine falcon can be hybridised to provide falcons used in the control of larger birds considered pests.

<text>Arthur Ernest Wilder-Smith, FRSC (22 December 1915 – 14 September 1995) was a British organic chemist and young Earth creationist.

==Biography==
Wilder-Smith earned three doctorates; his first PhD in 1941 in Physical Organic Chemistry from Reading University, England, his second in 1964 in Pharmacology from the University of Geneva, and his third from Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), Zurich.

As a chemist, Wilder-Smith joined Imperial Chemical Industries during World War II. Following the war, the University of London made him the Countess of Lisburne Memorial Fellow. Wilder-Smith accepted an appointment as Director of Research for a Swiss pharmaceutical company. While in Switzerland, the Medical School of the University of Geneva elected him to teach Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, for which he received habilitation, the qualification required for professional appointments to European continental universities.

In 1957-1958 Wilder-Smith accepted the position of Visiting Assistant Professor at the Medical Center of the University of Illinois. In 1959-1961 he was Visiting Full Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Bergen Medical School in Norway. He returned to the University of Geneva for two years then received an appointment as Full Professor of Pharmacology back at the University of Illinois Medical Center in 1963. As a lecturer, he won three &#x27;Golden Apple&#x27; Awards in consecutive years for excellence in education and four awards for best series of senior year lectures.

Wilder-Smith was Professor of Pharmacology for two years at Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. He served as a NATO consultant for the prevention and treatment of drug abuse.

==Family life and religious views==
In 1949, A. E. Wilder-Smith married Beate (17 September 1928 – 15 January 2015), daughter of Rev. Wilhelm Gottwaldt, of Breslau, Germany. She accompanied him through twenty-three moves of their home and rearing of their four children, Oliver, Petra, Clive, and Einar. Each of their children are also professors in their respective medical fields at international universities.

Arthur Wilder-Smith began his education as an atheist. His wife, Beate Wilder-Smith, wrote that Arthur had concluded, &quot;If a loving God really existed, He surely would not have tolerated all the injustice and suffering evident in the world.&quot; He became acquainted with General Frost, a devout Christian who challenged Arthur&#x27;s atheistic worldview. Arthur placed his faith in Christ but continued to struggle intellectually with the difficulties between naturalistic evolution and biblical creation. While studying at Oxford, Arthur became acquainted with C. S. Lewis, a significant influence on Arthur&#x27;s thought processes and faith.

As a creationist, Wilder-Smith said there were problems with evolutionary views of the origin of life. This theme is reflected in many of his books including, &quot;The Creation of Life&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;s Origin, Man&#x27;s Destiny&quot;. According to Walter L. Bradley, Wilder-Smith contended &quot;that the conversion of energy flow into information remains, at present, undemonstrated and without theoretical basis.&quot; Some considered him Europe&#x27;s leading creationist. He was not afraid to correct creationists when he believed they were wrong as when he made the comment to Francis Arduini in 1984 that Henry M. Morris &quot;didn&#x27;t know a thing about thermodynamics&quot;.
In 1966 he published the book &quot;Herkunft und Zukunft des Menschen&quot; which promoted Burdick&#x27;s and other&#x27;s claims that dinosaur and human footprints existed together at Paluxy River. Wilder-Smith included in his book plates showing the Paluxy site including plates attributed to himself, Burdick and Taylor. With the exception of plate 6 from Burdick all plates claiming to be man tracks were in situ. In the mid-1980s the footprints were shown to be not of human origin, and some specimens were shown to be doctored or carved, in particular the loose blocks attributed to Burdick.

In 1970, Wilder-Smith published &quot;The Creation of Life: A Cybernetic Approach to Evolution&quot; which defended William Paley&#x27;s design argument with computer calculations of the improbability of genetic sequences, which he said could not be explained by evolution but required &quot;the abhorred necessity of divine intelligent activity behind nature,&quot; and that &quot;the same problem would be expected to beset the relationship between the designer behind nature and the intelligently designed part of nature known as man.&quot; His research and writing were influential in the formation of the intelligent design movement. In 2005, intelligent design advocate William A. Dembski wrote that Wilder-Smith&#x27;s &quot;intuitive ideas about information has been the impetus for much of my research.&quot; Wilder-Smith had never used the phrase &quot;intelligent design&quot; itself. The closest phrasing may be found in his 1968 publication &quot;Man’s origin, man’s destiny: a critical survey of the principles of evolution and Christianity&quot;, which with its argument that the mammary glands in whales could not have arisen by chance mutations. Wilder-Smith wrote that (emphasis added) &quot;To deny planning when studying such a system is to strain credulity more than to ask one to believe in an &quot;intelligent nipple designer&quot;, who incidentally must have understood hydraulics rather well.&quot;

In the 1986 Oxford Union debate, Wilder-Smith and creationist physicist Edgar Andrews (President of the Biblical Creation Society) debated creationism with biologists Richard Dawkins and John Maynard Smith.

Wilder-Smith&#x27;s book &quot;The Natural Sciences Know Nothing of Evolution&quot; was published in 1981 by an imprint of Creation-Life Publishing, and reprinted in 1992 by Answers in Genesis. Kenneth Christiansen, a biologist at Grinnell College, reviewed the book stating &quot;the most fundamental flaw of the book is an apparent confusion or ignorance (it is hard to tell) concerning our present understanding of the evolutionary process.&quot; He further noted that Wilder-Smith&#x27;s work disregarded basic literature in the field discussed. In 1998 the book was one of 19 which a public school board in Melvindale, Michigan, voted to purchase for school libraries &quot;to make sure the district was not supporting the theory of evolution as a fact&quot;. An analysis by the National Center for Science Education described the book as &quot;religious doctrine in disguise&quot; promoting the intelligent design argument, with abundant errors typical of creation science, misrepresenting the science of evolution.

<text>Espen J. Aarseth (born 1965) is a Norwegian academic specializing in the fields of video game studies and electronic literature. Aarseth completed his doctorate at the University of Bergen. He co-founded the Department of Humanistic Informatics at the University of Bergen, and worked there until 2003, at which time he was a full professor.

He is currently a full professor and Head of the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen, and principal investigator of a €2 million ERC Advanced grant for the project Making Sense of Games. Aarseth is also the Editor in Chief of Game Studies, the oldest peer-reviewed journal in the field of game studies, and member of the advisory board of G|A|M|E, a journal of comparative videogame analysis.

==&quot;Cybertext&quot;==
Aarseth&#x27;s works include groundbreaking &quot;Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature&quot; (Johns Hopkins UP 1997) book, which was originally his doctoral thesis. Cybertext focuses on mechanical organization of texts by placing the medium as a critical part of literary exchanges. The book introduces the concept of ergodic literature, which is a text that requires non-trivial effort to be traversed. The book also contains a well-known (pre-ludological) theory, &quot;typology of cybertext&quot; which allows ergodic texts to be classified by their functional qualities. (In Aarseth&#x27;s later work with Solveig Smedstad &amp; Lise Sunnanå this typology of cybertext transforms into &quot;a multi-dimensional typology of games&quot;.)

==Non-linear media==
Aarseth also wrote an article, &quot;Nonlinearity and Literary Theory&quot;, which was published in &quot;Hyper/Text/Theory&quot; and &quot;The New Media Reader&quot;. The article discusses the concept behind nonlinear texts, stepping away from the category of hypertext and delving into different types of media which can also be considered nonlinear. He identifies nonlinear texts as objects of verbal communication in which the words or sequence of words may differ from reading to reading. He also outlines the different categories and varieties of nonlinear texts. Additionally, he talks about how writing is more than just signs and symbols. Writing can be broken down into two units which are called textons and scriptons. The essay also discusses hypertext fiction in depth as well as works of interactive fiction, such as Colossal Cave Adventure, and MUDs.

<text>Guild Wars is an online role-playing game franchise developed by ArenaNet and published by NCSoft. The games were critically well received and won many editor&#x27;s choice awards, as well as awards such as &quot;Massively Multiplayer/Persistent World Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, as well as Best Value, Best Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), and Best Game. &quot;Guild Wars&quot; was noted for being the &quot;first major MMO to adopt a business model not based on monthly subscription fees&quot;, its instanced approach to gameplay, and the quality of the graphics and play for computers with low specifications. In April 2009, NCSoft announced that 6 million units of games in the &quot;Guild Wars&quot; series had been sold. The sequel and fourth major entry into the series, &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot;, was announced in March 2007 and released on August 28, 2012. It features updated graphics and gameplay mechanics, and continues the original &quot;Guild Wars&quot; tradition of no subscription fees. The &quot;Guild Wars&quot; series had sold 11.5 million copies by August 2015

==&quot;Guild Wars&quot; subseries (2005-2007)==

The original subseries consisting of the &quot;Guild Wars Prophecies&quot;, &quot;Guild Wars Factions&quot;, &quot;Guild Wars Nightfall&quot;, and &quot;Guild Wars: Eye of the North&quot; games coexist within a unified game world. The games provide two main modes of gameplay—a cooperative role-playing component that is specific to each campaign, and a competitive PvP component that is shared across all campaigns. Three stand-alone campaigns, one major expansion pack, and several &quot;mini&quot;-expansions were released in the series from April 2005 to April 2013. The games depict the fictional fantasy world of &quot;Tyria&quot;; each campaign focuses on events in disjointed sections of the world at roughly the same time. A player creates an avatar to play through the cooperative storyline of a campaign, taking on the role of a hero who must save Tyria from its antagonists. Players can group with other players and non-player characters, known as &quot;henchmen&quot; and &quot;heroes&quot;, to perform &quot;missions&quot; and &quot;quests&quot; found throughout the game-world. PvP combat is consensual, team based, and limited to areas designed for such combat. Players are allowed to create characters at maximum level and with the best equipment specifically for PvP play, which is unusual for MMORPGs. Historically, ArenaNet hosted official &quot;Guild Wars&quot; tournaments where the most successful players and guilds competed for the chance to play live at gaming conventions and win prizes up to US$100,000.

=== Gameplay ===
Players use a 3D avatar to interact with the world around them. The game predominantly features a third-person perspective but also has the option of first-person. These characters are able to walk/run and interact with other characters through chat. They can also perform actions such as fighting and picking up objects, as well as interacting with special objects.

=== Character creation ===
Players can choose from a range of up to ten different professions. When creating a character, players can select their hair style, face, skin tone, height and avatar name—the selection depending upon that profession chosen. As the player progresses through the game, they can unlock different armor and weapons to alter the visual appearance of that avatar. They can also decide whether they want their avatar to start in a Player vs. Environment world (the RPG aspect of the game), or get right into the competitive Player vs. Player and fight live against other players in the game.

The maximum level for character development is capped at 20—by this point, the character will also have reached 170 attribute points. Players may also choose to do certain quests to gain another 30 attribute points, making the maximum points available 200. Experience can still be gained and is used to learn more skills or buy consumable items throughout the game.

=== Professions ===

A profession is a type of class commonly found in most RPGs and is central to the gameplay in Guild Wars. Each profession has an array of attributes and skills that help narrow a class&#x27;s proficiency in order to perform a customized role that is determined by the player. The &quot;Warrior&quot; profession, for example, has access to the primary &quot;Strength&quot; attribute that increases their armor penetration with martial weapons, and is able to wear heavy armor providing the highest protection against physical damage of all professions. &quot;Elementalists&quot;, on the other hand, wear less protective armor, but can use their primary &quot;Energy Storage&quot; attribute to give them a much greater pool of energy than other professions.

Guild Wars also introduces the ability to choose a secondary profession, expanding the selection of attributes and skills. A character does not, however, have access to the primary attribute of its secondary profession. Many, but not all, skills become more powerful with more points in a class&#x27;s primary attribute. A Warrior/Elementalist, therefore, is a warrior who may use spells in combat, although the Elementalist spells used will generally not have as much power as those of a primary Elementalist. This is increased by the fact that runes, which among other things increase attribute levels, can only increase the attribute levels associated with a player&#x27;s primary profession.

There are over a thousand skills in the game that can be acquired by the character over time, but players may only use and equip up to 8 of them at any one time. This introduces levels of strategy, in which one must have a careful selection of skills that work well with one another and with teammates in order to survive.

The core professions are Warrior, Monk, Elementalist, Ranger, Necromancer and Mesmer. The Assassin and Ritualist professions are exclusive to Guild Wars: Factions, which can be played along with the aforementioned core professions. The Paragon and Dervish professions are exclusive to Guild Wars: Nightfall, and can also be played with the core professions. Unlike the campaigns, Guild Wars: Eye of the North (the only expansion pack of the Guild Wars franchise) does not offer any new playable professions.

=== Environment ===
The Guild Wars universe consists of persistent staging zones known as &quot;towns&quot; and &quot;outposts&quot;. These areas normally contain non-player characters that provide services such as merchandising or storage. Other NPC&#x27;s provide quests and present rewards to adventurers. These areas are also used when forming groups of people to go out into the world and play cooperatively. Players that venture out from the staging area and into an instanced explorable area are then able to use their weapons and skills to defeat monsters and interact with other objects in the game. As players progress through the game, they gain access to additional staging zones. Players can then transport their characters instantly from one staging area to another using a process commonly referred to as &#x27;map traveling&#x27;.

=== Combat ===
Apart from fighting with weapons, skills make up the majority of combat interaction. Each skill has a different effect when used, and fall under many different categories. They can range from offensive skills such as setting foes on fire and defensive skills which include resurrection and healing allies. Enchantments that include giving players extra health points or Hexes that drain the enemy&#x27;s life and add it to your own make up part of the skill selection in &quot;Guild Wars&quot;. Attack skills are used in conjunction with weapons to augment the damage that they can deal and cause different side effects (such as knocking people to the ground with a hammer, causing bleeding wounds that deal additional damage over time with a sword, or striking multiple foes with an axe).

Most skills have a governing attribute that determines its power and effect. These attributes are assigned using a number of &quot;attribute points&quot; similar to the point buy ability score generation system in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

&quot;Guild Wars&quot; skill system is often compared to collectible card games such as &quot;&quot; because of the way the different skills interact. While in a town or staging area, a character&#x27;s skill and attribute selection can be freely modified to construct a &quot;build&quot;. Once in a combat zone (such as an explorable area or a PvP arena), the build becomes immutable until the character exits the combat zone and returns to a staging area. Players generally either choose a specific build for a given area or role, or use builds that synergize with the builds of other characters in the party.

A player&#x27;s ability to help the party is based on the way a player&#x27;s &quot;build&quot; works. If the skills combine well, such as a hex spell that makes an enemy attack faster and then another one that makes him miss 75% of the time and take damage for each miss, then the build will work effectively.

In PvE, monsters that are slain will generate gold and loot which can be traded or sold to players or NPCs. Unique or rare weapon designs are often found from defeating powerful monsters, or by opening treasure chests.

In PvP, reputation in the form of &quot;faction&quot; is gained based on how well a player performs. &quot;Balthazar faction&quot; is gained by the number of wins that you and your team achieve, and for each unique kill. Most PvP in &quot;Guild Wars&quot; is fast-paced, while the transition period between games may take longer.

=== Co-operative gameplay ===
Player versus Environment (PvE) missions of &quot;Guild Wars&quot; use several standard tropes of the MMORPG genre. Players explore the game-world, kill monsters, perform quests and complete missions to earn rewards and advance the story. Rewards include experience points, skill points, skills, gold, faction, reputation and items for the player character. Some of these rewards not only advance the particular character being played at the time, but also unlock features of the game account-wide.

In each campaign the player is involved in a linear story with which they interact by performing a series of &quot;primary quests&quot; and &quot;replayable missions&quot;. Quests are given to a player by NPCs via text dialog. As quests and missions are completed, new areas, new quests, and new missions are unlocked for the player&#x27;s character to access. Missions allow the player character to participate in the major events of the storyline, such as significant battles against the main antagonist. Both quests and missions can feature in-game cut scenes which advance the story and provide context to the actions which follow. Cut scenes are in the third-person, often featuring the party leader&#x27;s character and revealing elements of the game that the character would not normally be aware of, such as the actions of an antagonist. Players are given the option of skipping the cut scenes if all party members agree upon it.

There are different types of PvE in &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, and it is advisable to prepare a build to meet the challenges of each type:
; Cooperative Mission : Missions that move the game story. These form the backbone of the storyline in each campaign. Each requires a party of 4–8 players (and sometimes NPCs) to complete certain objectives. The party fails the mission if every member dies.
; Explorable Area : Unlike cooperative missions, your party can die in explorable areas without grave consequences, and you will be respawned at a &quot;resurrection shrine&quot;, but there are exceptions. Explorable areas are where quests are accepted and played out. Unlike a cooperative mission, players can work on several quests at the same time.
; Elite Mission : Especially difficult missions, with an 8–12 player party size, that require a high amount of preparation, skill, knowledge and time commitment. Having the correct team build is a must, and players must coordinate with other team members more than normal.
; Dungeon : Subterranean explorable areas in the &quot;Eye of the North&quot; expansion. A quest is given to guide the party through the dungeon, culminating in a boss fight, after which rewards are distributed.
; Minigame : Minigames are either competitive or cooperative &quot;mini missions&quot; or battles that have no bearing on the plot of the &quot;Guild Wars&quot; campaigns. Some are present in the game only during special events, such as the &quot;Dragon Arena&quot; for the &quot;Canthan New Year&quot; and &quot;Dragon Festival&quot;. Rewards offered for competing in these games include tokens which can be traded for prizes
; Challenge Mission : A special form of mission that is not part of the main story, in which parties aim to reach a high score. Unlike other forms of PvE play, Challenge Missions can theoretically go on forever, with the difficulty increasing the longer the player or party manages to stay alive.

=== Competitive gameplay ===
Player versus Player (PvP) combat in &quot;Guild Wars&quot; is consensual and team-based. Such combat is restricted to special PvP areas, the majority of which are located on the core area known as &quot;The Battle Isles&quot;. Individual campaigns also have certain campaign-specific PvP arenas. Players may participate in PvP combat with either their role-playing characters or with characters created specifically for PvP. Characters are rewarded with experience points for victories in competitive battle and the player account also acquires &quot;faction points&quot; redeemable for in-game rewards. In addition to this victory may also award points which contribute towards completion of character or account based &quot;titles&quot;.

The following are the competitive modes in &quot;Guild Wars&quot;:
; Random Arena : Four-on-four matches with teams randomly composed from those waiting to enter combat. There are many different arenas with different victory conditions: deathmatch and kill-count.
; Team Arena : The Team Arenas were PvP arenas where two groups of four organized players battle each other. Groups were formed in the eponymous outpost and Random Arenas teams with 10 consecutive wins automatically enter the Team Arenas. Both Balthazar faction and Gladiator points could be obtained from Team Arenas. Team Arenas was replaced with Codex Arena in 2009.
; Codex Arena : Four-on-four matches with player-managed teams. These matches are played in the same areas as the Random Arena with a few exceptions. Each class has a pool of limited amounts of skills to choose from and this pool changes every 6 hours.
; Heroes&#x27; Ascent : A continuous tournament where players form teams of eight to battle in a sequence of arenas, culminating in the &quot;Hall of Heroes&quot; whose results are broadcast to all online players in addition to rewarding the victors with high-end loot. Arenas in the Heroes&#x27; Ascent tournament include deathmatch, altar-control, and capture-the-relic victory conditions. Victories in the Heroes&#x27; Ascent award players with &quot;fame points&quot; that can be used to determine the &quot;rank&quot; of the player.
; Guild Battles : Two guilds meet in guild halls and stage a tactical battle with the aim of killing the opposing &quot;Guild Lord&quot;, a well-protected NPC. Victory in guild battles affects the &quot;rank&quot; of the guild in the global Guild versus Guild (GvG) ladder. GvG is considered the most supported of competitive formats in Guild Wars. In 2005, ArenaNet hosted a Guild Wars World Championship, and in 2006, the Guild Wars Factions Championship was hosted as well. Since then, the Automated Tournament system has become the norm, but smaller 3rd-party tournaments have been hosted, including the Rawr Cup and the Guild Wars Guru cup. The GWWC, GWFC, RawrCup, and GWG Tournament all had real life prizes; the former tournaments had cash prizes, the RawrCup and Guru Tournament had laptops and MP3 players to give away.
; Alliance Battles : &quot;Guild Wars Factions&quot; introduced an arena where twelve players aligned with one of the opposing &quot;Kurzick&quot; and &quot;Luxon&quot; factions team up to fight an opposing team to gain new territory for their faction. The twelve player team is composed of three teams with four human players each. The three teams are selected randomly from the teams waiting on each side when the match begins. Alliance Battles grant &quot;alliance faction&quot; and affect the border between the two factions in the &quot;Factions&quot;-specific continent of &quot;Cantha&quot;. The location of the border affects the map in which the battles take place by adding a bias to favor the faction losing the war. Additionally, alliance faction can be contributed to a player&#x27;s guild (if it is allied with the respective faction), allowing that guild to &quot;control&quot; a town in their faction&#x27;s territory.
; Competitive Missions : &quot;Factions&quot; also introduced a pair of competitive arenas, named &quot;Fort Aspenwood&quot; and &quot;The Jade Quarry&quot;, where randomly assembled teams of 8 players from the opposing factions enact particular events in the Kurzick/Luxon war. Victories in these missions have no global effect, but do grant the players with &quot;alliance faction&quot;.
; Minigame : Minigames are either competitive or cooperative &quot;mini missions&quot; or battles that have no bearing on the plot and do not advance the story line of the Guild Wars campaigns. Most are added to the game during festivals and events.
; Hero Battles: Hero Battles was the name given to the mode of PvP known as Hero versus Hero (HvH). In this contest, players would enter the battle with 3 heroes (fully customizable NPC allies), and fight another player and his/her team of 3 heroes. A player must have had a named account to participate in Hero Battles. This type of PvP was removed in the October 22nd, 2009 update.

Guild Wars has a continuously running &quot;automated tournament system&quot;. Players or guilds elect to participate in the tournament by buying in-game tokens using their PvP faction points. The participants are divided randomly into groups of 32 that participate daily in up to six Swiss rounds held on a fixed schedule, and the top eight guilds continue on to a single-elimination tournament. Participants who are unable to field a full team automatically forfeit their round. Success in daily automated tournaments qualifies that particular guild for play in the monthly automated tournament, and the final victors of this tournament earn a number of real and in-game rewards. Players who do not participate in the automated tournament were allowed to place bets on the results of these tournaments for a number of in-game rewards prior to February 2010.

Many competitive matches may be observed by players by means of an &quot;observer mode&quot;. Important PvP matches such as matches in the &quot;Hall of Heroes&quot; or between highly rated guilds may be observed (after a delay of fifteen minutes) by others in order to see the tactics used by successful teams and attempt to learn or counter them. Guilds may additionally observe their own Guild Battles for a fixed period of time.

=== Guilds ===

As the name suggests, guilds are a core element of &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, manifesting not only as social units but also being closely linked with the game mechanics. Although a player is not required to join a guild, it adds value to the gaming time and increases camaraderie. Often, joining a guild is a good way to get help from more experienced players as the in-game guild interface allows communication between guild members.

A guild leader creates the guild by registering a guild name and a &quot;tag&quot; (between two and four characters long) with a Guild Registrar, found in some major towns. The guild tag is displayed in brackets after the names of guild members. The leader also designs the guild&#x27;s cape (from a large palette of shapes, patterns and emblems), and purchases a guild hall that serves as the guild headquarters and may be furnished with merchants, traders, and storage NPCs. Each guild hall is an individual instanced outpost located at the same spot on the Battle Isles, but they are not physically accessible to non-allied members as the only way to enter a guild hall is by &quot;map travel&quot;. The guild leader recruits new players to the guild and can promote a number of them to &quot;guild officers&quot;, who can then help with the recruitment and further promotion of officers. All player characters on the same &quot;Guild Wars&quot; account belong to the same guild. Players may leave their guild whenever they please, but only the leader and officers can dismiss non-officer players from the guild; the leader has the additional power to dismiss officers and disband the guild. Guilds have a membership limit of 100 members; player communities with more than that many members generally create allied sister guilds, often named similarly and using the same tag and cape.

Up to ten individual guilds may ally together to form an &quot;alliance&quot;. Members of an alliance may communicate over a shared chat channel, and visit the guild halls of the other guilds of the alliance. Each alliance has a leader guild that initiates the alliance, the leader of which is also the alliance leader, who may admit or dismiss guilds from the alliance. Each alliance must be devoted to either the Kurzicks or the Luxons, the two Canthan factions (from &quot;Guild Wars Factions&quot;) locked in perpetual conflict. Players can accumulate &quot;faction&quot; (reputation) with either the Kurzicks or the Luxons, which can either be &quot;donated&quot; to the alliance or redeemed for certain in-game rewards. The alliances with the highest total amount of donated faction are given control of certain in-game outposts on the Canthan continent; controlling an outpost gives the alliance members access to restricted areas of the outposts, containing, among other things, merchants who sell at a discount.

In addition to membership in guilds, a player may be a guest of any number of other guilds. Guest privileges are limited to visiting the guild hall and participating in guild or alliance battles. An accepted invitation expires after 24 hours.

=== Campaigns ===
Full games in the original &quot;Guild Wars&quot; sequence were released in episodes known as &quot;campaigns&quot;. Players must purchase an individual campaign in order to access the game elements specific to that campaign; however, all campaigns are linked in one game world. Each campaign is independent of the others, with its own co-operative storyline, campaign-specific skills, and competitive arenas. Players owning different campaigns may still interact in shared areas, including trading for items specific to the campaigns they have not purchased. Players who own two or more campaigns may transport their characters freely from one campaign to the other, integrating into the storyline as a foreign hero.

The first campaign, &quot;Guild Wars Prophecies&quot; (originally named &quot;Guild Wars&quot;), was released on April 28, 2005. The &quot;Prophecies&quot; storyline is situated on the continent of &quot;Tyria&quot; and revolves around the &quot;Flameseeker Prophecy&quot;, a prophecy made by an ancient dragon named Glint.

&quot;Prophecies&quot; was followed by &quot;Guild Wars Factions&quot; on April 28, 2006, released exactly a year after &quot;Prophecies&quot;. &quot;Factions&quot; is situated on the small southern continent of &quot;Cantha&quot; that is separated from &quot;Tyria&quot; by a vast ocean. The events of the &quot;Factions&quot; campaign concern the return from death of a corrupted bodyguard named Shiro Tagachi. &quot;Factions&quot; features a global persistent war between the rival vassal nations of Cantha; the Luxons and the Kurzicks, and the notion of guild alliances (see &quot;guilds&quot; above). The continent of Cantha is heavily based upon and influenced by eastern Asia.

The third campaign, &quot;Guild Wars Nightfall&quot;, was released on October 27, 2006. &quot;Nightfall&quot; features the arid continent of Elona, joined to southern Tyria across a vast desert. &quot;Nightfall&quot; introduced heroes, advanced computer-controlled units that can be micro-managed by players, including the ability to customize their skill layout and equipment. The continent of Elona is heavily based on and influenced by North Africa.

=== Expansions ===

Scrapping their initial plans for a fourth campaign, ArenaNet has released an expansion pack, &quot;Guild Wars: Eye of the North&quot;, to the previous three campaigns on August 31, 2007. Not being a full campaign, this expansion requires one of the other released campaigns, and is only accessible by player characters at level 10 and above. &quot;Eye of the North&quot; therefore does not feature new professions, but contains new content for existing characters: dungeons, a number of new skills, armor, and &quot;heroes&quot;. &quot;Eye of the North&quot; is set in previously inaccessible territory from the first Guild Wars campaign, &quot;Prophecies&quot;. It is intended to be a bridge to the sequel to the &quot;Guild Wars&quot; series, &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot;. As a promotion for their online store and &quot;Eye of the North&quot;, ArenaNet released a &quot;Bonus Mission Pack&quot; for purchase online. It contains playable recreations of four incidents in the history of &quot;Tyria&quot;, &quot;Cantha&quot;, and &quot;Elona&quot;, and each mission expands the backstory for one of four major NPCs.

In an effort to resolve plot threads, ArenaNet has released a series of &quot;mini-expansion&quot; updates, collectively known as &quot;Guild Wars Beyond&quot;. This series of storylines and events in &quot;Guild Wars&quot; helps set the stage for &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot;, which takes place 250 years in the future. &quot;Guild Wars Beyond&quot; begins with War in Kryta, then Hearts of the North, and continues with Winds of Change. After the &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot; release, ArenaNet formally announced that they &quot;will no longer release any new content, but will continue to update the game. We would like to thank all &quot;Guild Wars&quot; players who participated in our active poll, choosing what rewards you would like to see when linking your &quot;Guild Wars&quot; accounts&quot;. Some of these scrapped Beyond-updates included: the Ebon Vanguards&#x27; withdrawal and establishment of Ebonhawke; the Lunatic Court and their attempts to free Mad King Thorn; expanding on the story of Palawa Joko and continuing that plot thread, which was left dangling in Nightfall; and the disappearance of Evennia, last seen in Old Ascalon during the Krytan civil war.

==&quot;Guild Wars 2&quot; (2012)==

&quot;Guild Wars 2&quot; is the sequel to the original &quot;Guild Wars&quot;. It was released on August 28, 2012. The game&#x27;s campaign centers on the awakening of the Elder Dragon Zhaitan and the cataclysm that this brings to Tyria. This threat unites the game&#x27;s major factions to form a Pact. From 2012 to 2014 the game was actively updated with temporary content releases that came to be known as Living World Season 1. From 2014 to 2015 updates were shifted to a permanent content model that integrated with the characters&#x27; story progression. These updates, comprising Living World Season 2, featured a plot to awaken Mordremoth, leading to the game&#x27;s first expansion pack.

===&quot;Heart of Thorns&quot; (2015)===

&quot;Heart of Thorns&quot; is the first expansion pack for &quot;GW2&quot; and was released on October 23, 2015. The campaign follows the struggle of the Pact forces against the Elder Dragon Mordremoth. Major new features were introduced, including a new Revenant profession, elite specializations for existing professions, gliding, and guild halls. This was followed by two years of content updates, encompassing Living World Season 3. This season dealt with the aftermath of battling Mordremoth and initial forays against the remaining dragons, as well as the return of the god Balthazar, who seeks to kill the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik at any cost. It also introduced raid content, a feature that was promised in the marketing of &quot;HoT&quot;.

===&quot;Path of Fire&quot; (2017)===

&quot;Path of Fire&quot; is the second expansion pack for &quot;GW2&quot; and was released on September 22, 2017. In this campaign, the Pact heroes pursue Balthazar and the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik to Elona, the continent originally featured in &quot;Nightfall&quot;. This expansion introduced mounts to the game. Content updates will be divided into both Season 4, which deals primarily with fighting Palawa Joko, and Season 5 of the Living World.

===&quot;End of Dragons&quot; (2022)===

&quot;End of Dragons&quot; is the third expansion pack for &quot;GW2&quot; and was released on February 28, 2022. This campaign follows the Pact Heroes into the land of Cantha as they finish pursuing the remainder of the Elder Dragons.
===&quot;Secrets of the Obscure&quot; (2023)===
&quot;Secrets of the Obscure&quot; is the fourth expansion pack for &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot; and was released on August 22, 2023.

===&quot;Janthir Wilds&quot; (2024)===
&quot;Janthir Wilds&quot; is the fifth and latest expansion pack for &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot; and was released on August 20, 2024.

<doc id="799266" wikidata="Q17027261" url="?curid=799266" title="Music for Flute, Strings, and Percussion">
<text>Music for Flute, Strings, and Percussion is a piece written by Sofia Gubaidulina in 1994 dedicated to Pierre-Yves Artaud.

The instruments are divided into two sections, one of which is tuned a quarter-tone lower than the other. Gubaidulina (2001) describes, &quot;in this way the potential of treating both halves as &#x27;light&#x27; and &#x27;shadow&#x27; emerges.&quot; She uses three chords, one major, one minor, and one whose third is exactly halfway between (&quot;this triad possesses architectural significance, but also a symbolic meaning&quot;) being used at importance cadence points also determined by the five open strings of the higher orchestra section. The flute is in tune with this higher section, but through microintervals and glissandos also coincides with the lower section.

The piece has been recorded and released on:
*&quot;The Canticle of the Sun&quot; (1997) and &quot;Music for Flute, Strings, and Percussion&quot; (1994). The first performed by cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and London Voices conducted by Ryusuke Numajiri, the second by flutist Emmanuel Pahud and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Rostropovich. Gubaidulina attended the recording of both pieces.

<doc id="799275" wikidata="Q8042565" url="?curid=799275" title="XV International AIDS Conference, 2004">
<text>The XV International AIDS Conference was held in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, from July 11 to July 16, 2004. The main venue for the conference was the IMPACT Muang Thong Thani convention centre at Nonthaburi, north-east of downtown Bangkok. It was the first international AIDS conference to be held in Southeast Asia. International AIDS conferences have been held regularly since the first one in Atlanta in 1985.

At the opening ceremony on the evening of July 11, the main speakers were the Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. The opening was screened live on Thai national television.

Thaksin, whose government had been criticised by foreign observers for its harsh attitude to injecting drug users, surprised the conference by pledging to adopt a &quot;harm minimization&quot; approach to AIDS prevention among drug users, and to work co-operatively with non-government organizations, including the Thai Drug Users&#x27; Network. AIDS activists suggested that Thaksin had been promised greatly increased funding from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria if he adopted a more flexible attitude.

Annan, in a forceful speech, praised Thaksin and also the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, who was seated in the front row, for their leadership in developing strategies for fighting AIDS in developing countries. But he said that much more was needed, including a radical change in attitudes to women in many countries, since HIV infection is now increasing more rapidly among young women in developing countries that in any other population group. Annan said the empowerment of women, particularly in African and Asian countries, was the key to preventing the further spread of HIV infection.

The conference was attended by more than 20,000 delegates and a large contingent of local and international media. Many people with HIV/AIDS and delegates from developing countries were subsidized to attend the conference by governments, the United Nations, other international organizations and drug companies.

The United States, however, significantly reduced its official presence at the conference as compared to previous conferences. The Department of Health and Human Services, which spent US$3.6 million to send 236 people to the XIV International AIDS Conference in Barcelona in 2002, spent US$500,000 and sent only 50. The move was seen as a response to events in Barcelona, when Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson was shouted down by protestors.

The co-chairs of the conference were Dr. Vallop Thaineua of Thailand and Joep Lange of the Netherlands, president of the International AIDS Society, which was the formal host organization. The content of the conference was run by three program committees, the Community Program Committee, chaired by Senator Mechai Viravaidya and Donald De Gagne, the Scientific Program Committee chaired by Professor Prasert Thongcharoen and Professor David Cooper, and the Leadership Program Committee chaired by Pakdee Pothisiri and Debrework Zewdie.

The Leadership Program section of the Conference was, however, thrown into doubt by security concerns. On July 7 the Thai government cancelled a meeting on HIV/AIDS for national leaders planned as part of the conference. The leaders of 13 countries and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan were invited to the summit, which was to be hosted by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, but only one national leader and Annan accepted.

As at previous international AIDS conferences, both local and international organizations staged protests about various aspects of HIV/AIDS policy at the Bangkok conference. Activists protested during the opening of the conference to call attention to what they said were failures by governments worldwide in fighting AIDS. Tight security prevented any disruption to the ceremony, although Prime Minister Thaksin was heckled during his speech by some sections of the audience.

The protests were co-ordinated by Thailand&#x27;s AIDS Access Foundation. They called for increased worldwide access to antiretroviral treatments and greater financial support for treatment and prevention. Activists said that the United States and other Western nations were backtracking on funding pledges made at the Barcelona conference.

==Conference Organisation Overview==

The XV International AIDS Conference is organised by the International AIDS Society (IAS) and the Thai Ministry of Public Health as the local Host. The co-organisers of the conference are UNAIDS, three international community networks: ICW, ICASO, GNP+ and TNCA, a conglomerate of Thai AIDS NGOs.

Starting with Bangkok the IAS has established a central conference secretariat to organise the International AIDS Conferences as well as the HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment Conferences. The Local Host Secretariat is located in Bangkok to coordinate the work of local subcommittees. The Community Program Secretariat is located in Bangkok to handle capacity building, outreach and the community aspects of the program.

Representatives from the organisers and co-organisers form the basis of the Conference Organising Committee (COC). The Chairs of the conference represent the IAS and the Local Host. The COC in turn appoints two chairs each for the Scientific Program Committee (SPC), Community Program Committee (CPC) and Leadership Program Committee. The Committee Chairs serve on the COC. The SPC, CPC and LPC are then composed of leading representatives from a variety of fields who bring a diverse expertise to the conference planning process.

==Jonathan Mann Memorial Lecture==

On the third day of the conference Professor Dennis Altman of Melbourne, a leading figure in the arena of international HIV/AIDS politics since the 1980s, delivered the Jonathan Mann Memorial Lecture. His theme was &quot;structural interventions and vulnerable communities,&quot; particularly men who have sex with men, injecting drug users and sex workers. But he was not confined by this topic. He said of the late Professor Jonathan Mann, in whose honour the lecture is named: &quot;One of the things I liked about Jonathan was his willingness to offend when doing so would confront people with the consequences of their actions.&quot;

Altman pointed out that the tendency to blame rich countries and pharmaceutical companies for the failure to stem the rising tide of AIDS ignored that the fact that &quot;even poor countries can afford to support good prevention efforts, as Uganda and Cambodia remind us.&quot; More to blame, he said, was the failure of governments and religious leaderships to face up to the practices that facilitated the spread of HIV.

&quot;The greatest tragedy of HIV/AIDS is that we know how to stop its spread, and yet in most parts of the world we are failing to do so,&quot; Altman said. He cited what he called the deliberate neglect by governments, the unwillingness to speak openly of HIV and its risks, and the &quot;hypocrisy with which simple measures of prevention are forestalled in the name of culture, religion and tradition,&quot; as the major reasons for the continued spread of the epidemic.

Altman was particularly critical of the failure to remember the lessons learned by the gay male community during the first decade of the AIDS epidemic, particularly the need for affected communities to be at the centre of the response to AIDS. He called for an end to restrictions on the discussion and promotion of condoms, and an end to silence about homosexuality, sex work and drug use in many countries.

&quot;As the epidemic grows we have many reasons to be angry, particularly at the hypocrisies of most governments and most religious leaders,&quot; Altman concluded. &quot;We ignore the ways in which fundamentalists of all faiths perpetuate the gender and sexual inequalities that fuel the epidemic. But anger that is not supported by analysis, and that does not lead to action, is wasted and self-indulgent.&quot;

<text>John Alexander &quot;Bid&quot; McPhee (November 1, 1859 – January 3, 1943) was an American 19th-century Major League Baseball second baseman. He played 18 seasons in the majors, from until , all for the Cincinnati Reds franchise. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in . Known more for his fielding than his hitting, McPhee was the last second baseman to play without a glove.

== Early career ==
Born in Massena, New York, McPhee broke into professional baseball in as a catcher with the Davenport Brown Stockings of the Northwestern League. He played for Davenport for three seasons, shifting to second base during the season. After not playing baseball in 1880, he joined an independent team in Akron, Ohio in . Before the season, he signed a contract to play for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a team in the newly formed American Association.

== Major League Baseball career ==
Making his major league debut on May 2, 1882, the 22-year-old McPhee had a batting average of just .228, but he led the league in several fielding categories, including putouts and fielding percentage. With McPhee in the lineup for 78 out of their 80 games, the Red Stockings won the inaugural AA championship. McPhee was the only starting second baseman Cincinnati had for the first 18 seasons of its existence, accompanying the team to the National League in , when they became the Cincinnati Reds. In last two seasons of his career, he was the oldest player in the major leagues.

Over 18 years, McPhee batted .272, hit 53 home runs, hit 189 triples, scored 1,684 runs, had 1,072 runs batted in, and stole 568 bases (this number however is noted by the fact that statistics for McPhee&#x27;s first four seasons did not include stolen bases, and from 1886 until 1898, the American Association counted stolen bases if a runner happened to go from first base to third base on a single or advanced a base on an out). He had ten 100-plus seasons in runs scored and regularly led the league in many defensive categories despite playing without a glove for the first 14 years of his career. Without the benefit of the padding provided by fielding gloves, McPhee toughened his hands by soaking them in salt water.

Shortly after retiring as a player in 1899, McPhee rejoined the Reds as a manager. At the team&#x27;s helm for 1901 and part of 1902, he posted 79 wins and 124 losses for a .389 winning percentage.

== Death and honors ==
McPhee died in 1943. He was cremated and his ashes were interred in the mausoleum at Cypress View Memorial Gardens in San Diego, California.

McPhee was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in , more than 100 years after he played in his last major league game. He is the only Hall of Famer to spend significant time in the American Association. He is one of three Baseball Hall of Famers, along with Johnny Bench and Barry Larkin, who played their entire career in Cincinnati. McPhee is also the only Hall of Famer from the 1882 pennant-winning Cincinnati Red Stockings team.

Two years after his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, McPhee was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.

<doc id="799285" wikidata="Q3727687" url="?curid=799285" title="Motomu Kiyokawa">
<text>was a Japanese actor who specialized in voice acting. He was known for voicing Walter C. Dornez in &quot;Hellsing&quot;, Gargoyle in &quot;&quot;, Kōzō Fuyutsuki in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, Valkenhayn R. Hellsing in Blazblue, and Tippy in &quot;Is the Order a Rabbit?&quot;.

== Career ==
In 1957, he entered the Haiyuza theatrical training school; that same year, he joined a theater troupe fellowship, and in 1962, he formed Gekidan Theatre Company and Gekidan Dramahouse. His first voice acting role in an anime was for the 1964 anime adaption of &quot;Big X&quot;. Through working as an Acting Planner, he joined the Tokyo Actors&#x27; Co-operative in 1968. Most of Kiyokawa&#x27;s voice roles were that of older men.

Although stage acting was his main occupation, he made his debut in voice acting dubbing a soldier in 1962&#x27;s &quot;Combat!&quot;. He stated that the reason he did voice acting was &quot;[just] to make money.&quot;

Together, he and Reiko Yamada established the &quot;Dramahouse Voice Actor School D.D.&quot;, where he was an instructor.

He died of pneumonia on August 17, 2022, at age 87.

== Personality and characteristics ==
He was considered to be a baritone. His hobbies were judo and fencing.

In anime, he was a frequent contributor to Hideaki Anno&#x27;s works, beginning with his role as Gargoyle in 1990&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and continuing with his role as Kōzō Fuyutsuki in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

As a voice actor, he was known for his roles as older characters. He also voiced many monsters in the Tokusatsu genre. Hideaki Anno specifically sought out Kiyokawa because he liked Kiyokawa&#x27;s role in &quot;Himitsu Sentai Gorenger&quot;. Kiyokawa also played the role of Ultraman King in the Ultraman franchise, starting with &quot;Ultraman Leo.&quot;

Although Kiyokawa played many villains, he described his own voice was &quot;soft&quot;, stating &quot;I just can&#x27;t turn into a real villain&quot;. Therefore, when he was asked to play the antagonist Gargoyle in &quot;,&quot; Kiyokawa suggested to director Anno, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we play the roles in such a way that it is not clear who is the bad guy?&quot;. In addition to playing the role of the crew of the Nautilus, Kiyokawa provided commentary on the story from the second episode to the 23rd episode. In addition, when he voiced Dr. Mikamura in &quot;Mobile Fight G Gundam&quot;, director Yasuhiro Imagawa, after hearing Kiyokawa&#x27;s voice, said, &quot;I just can&#x27;t make him a bad guy,&quot; and eventually changed Dr. Mikamura, who was originally set up as a bad guy, to a good guy.

After the deaths of Akio Miyabe, Kazumi Tanaka, Tatsuyuki Ishimori, and Ichiro Nagai, Kiyokawa took over some of their roles.

<doc id="799287" wikidata="Q756753" url="?curid=799287" title="1983 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1983 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season in the satellite era and the least active overall since 1930. The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season had very little activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher. This led to the lowest accumulated cyclone energy count since 1977.

The season began later than normal; the first tropical depression formed on July 23 and the second on July 27. Neither tropical depressions strengthened and they dissipated soon thereafter. Hurricane Alicia formed as Tropical Depression Three on August 15, quickly intensified into a hurricane on August 16 and made landfall in Texas on August 18. Alicia caused $3 billion in damage in Texas. Hurricane Barry formed on August 25, crossed Florida and strengthened into a hurricane. Barry made landfall near the Mexico–United States border, and dissipated over land on August 30.

Hurricane Chantal, the third and final hurricane in 1983, formed on September 10. It strengthened into a hurricane, but stayed out at sea, and was absorbed by a frontal system on September 15. Tropical Depression Six formed on September 18 and caused heavy rains in the Caribbean before degenerating into a wave on September 20. Tropical Storm Dean was the final storm of the season, forming on September 26. It originally tracked to the north, peaking at winds, and made landfall in the Delmarva Peninsula on September 29. It dissipated over the coast of Virginia on the following day.


== Seasonal forecasts ==

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU). A normal season, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the period from 1981 to 2010, has approximately 12 named storms, with 6 of those reaching hurricane status. About 3 hurricane strengthen into major hurricanes, which are tropical cyclones that reach at least Category 3 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale.

The July 23, 1983, forecasters at CSU predicted that after the slow start to the season, a total of eight tropical storms would develop, and five of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status. CSU based this prediction on an ongoing El Niño event, sea-level pressures, and wind currents. However, the prediction issued by CSU proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming by the end of the season and three of those reaching hurricane status. The CSU attributed the overforecast to the El Niño event being stronger and more persistent than they expected.

== Seasonal summary ==

The season, which began on June 1 and ended on November 30, was very inactive because of strong upper-level wind shear. The wind shear was unusually strong throughout the Caribbean and open Atlantic, and disrupted convection in areas of disturbed weather so they could not develop. Over 60 African systems had formed and made it westward, but when they reached the Lesser Antilles, they were dissolved easily. The only area where the shear was minimal—a region encompassing the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic north of the Bahamas and east of Florida—was where the four named storms developed. Another contributing factor to the low number of storms may have been the decaying 1982–83 El Niño event. The season total of four named storms was the fewest in the satellite era, while the 1983 season was the least active since 1930, which had only three storms. This season and the previous became the first example of two consecutive years to have no storms form in the Caribbean since reliable record began. Additionally, the 1983 season was the first on record in which a system did not reach tropical storm intensity south of 25°N latitude.

The National Hurricane Center also issued numeric landfall probabilities for the first time in 1983. Probabilities had been calculated for prior storms for use in the issuing of hurricane watches and warnings, but this was the first time the raw numeric probabilities were released to the public. The probabilities issued were accurate during Alicia, indicating that Galveston and surrounding portions of the upper Texas coast were the most likely area to be struck.

Tropical cyclogenesis began on July 23, when Tropical Depression One formed over the deep Atlantic. After crossing the Windward Islands, the depression dissipated over the eastern Caribbean on July 28. As the previous system moved across the Caribbean, another depression formed on July 27 to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The depression traversed the Atlantic in a west-northwestward direction and also failed to reach tropical storm intensity before dissipating near the northern Leeward Islands on August 2. Later in August, hurricanes Alicia and Barry developed. The former also became the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of . Alicia caused 21 fatalities and approximately $3 billion in damage, mostly in Texas. Three tropical cyclones formed in September – Hurricane Chantal, Tropical Depression Six, and Tropical Storm Dean. The dissipation of Dean on September 30 marked the end of tropical cyclone activity.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a very low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 17, one of the lowest on record, which is classified as &quot;below normal&quot;. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==

=== Tropical Depression One ===

Tropical Depression One developed about halfway between French Guiana and the Cape Verde Islands on July 23. The National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the depression strengthening into a tropical storm in media reports, but upper-level wind shear inhibited any development. The depression dissipated over the eastern Caribbean late on July 28.
=== Tropical Depression Two ===

An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression southwest of the Cape Verde Islands on July 27. The depression moved generally west-northwestward across the deep Atlantic for several days, but failed to strengthened significantly due to strong upper-level wind shear. The depression dissipated near the northern Leeward Islands on August 2.
=== Hurricane Alicia ===
The system that would become Hurricane Alicia originated from the western end of a frontal trough that stretched from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. Satellite pictures showed a meso-scale low-pressure area that had moved off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts near the trough and was possibly the precursor system to Alicia. Pressures in the Gulf of Mexico were high and stayed high during the early development stages. On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015 millibars (29.99 inHg), when the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia. With high environmental pressures around it, Alicia remained a small system.

Steering currents above Alicia remained weak during the storm&#x27;s lifetime. However, a ridge was well formed to the north of the developing storms. With fluctuations in the pressures, Alicia began to drift to west on August 16. This was short-lived, as Alicia turned to the northwest towards Texas. During the period of August 16 to August 18, an anticyclone had formed over Alicia and along with slow movement over warm waters, caused Alicia to intensify rapidly. The pressure in Alicia decreased one millibar an hour in the 40 hours before landfall. Alicia peaked at in winds and in pressure on August 18. Alicia made landfall near Galveston on August 18 as a Category 3 hurricane. Alicia weakened quickly over land and accelerated over the Midwest, before dissipating over Nebraska on August 21.

As Alicia moved northward, the remnants caused moderate to heavy rainfall in several states. Houston suffered heavy damage, including thousands of shattered glass panes from downtown skyscrapers. Overall, Alicia killed 21 people and caused $3 billion (1983 USD) in damage.

=== Hurricane Barry ===
Hurricane Barry originated from a tropical disturbance that left the Northwestern African coast on August 13. Most of the season, the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean had upper-level wind shear, which had inhibited development of systems. Due to these conditions, the disturbance was unable to strengthen until August 22 as it was approaching the Bahamas. A weak trough moved the disturbance into an area of low wind shear, and the disturbance intensified into Tropical Depression Four on the evening of August 23. The depression was just to the northeast of the northern Bahamian Islands where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of August 24.

Tropical Storm Barry subsequently turned to the west into an area of increased wind shear and weakened rapidly. It was able to make landfall near Melbourne, Florida, on the morning of August 25 as a 45 mph tropical storm, before weakening to a tropical depression over Florida. After Tropical Depression Barry emerged from central Florida, it was still under pressure from high-level winds. The depression entered the central Gulf of Mexico, and after meandering west for a day or so, returned to tropical storm strength. Just off the coast of Mexico, Barry rapidly intensified into a hurricane on August 28, just before making landfall near Matamoros that afternoon. Before landfall, Barry peaked with winds and a pressure of 986 millibars (29.11 inHg). The remnants quickly dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental on August 29.
=== Hurricane Chantal ===

The precursor low to Chantal originated from a large envelope of low pressure on the morning of September 10. The disturbed weather, nested off the coast of Bermuda, was one of the remnants of an old frontal trough that had extended from Hispaniola to the central north Atlantic Ocean. This particular area of disturbed weather become part of the northeast portion of a low-pressure system. On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of and a 1010 millibar (29.83 inHg) pressure reading, indicating development into a tropical depression.

The depression moved to within of Bermuda and slowly intensified. Late that afternoon, Tropical Depression Five had intensified into a storm and was named Chantal. Chantal intensified rapidly, intensifying to hurricane status late on September 11. It then turned to the east and gained a weak upper-level cirrus-cloud outflow. The structure of the system changed little over the next 24 hours, before Chantal lost organization and was downgraded to a tropical storm on the night of the 12th.

Overnight, all convection in Chantal dissipated, and its forward speed decreased as it headed north. A frontal system attracted and absorbed the remnants of Chantal by the night of September 14. Effects on Bermuda were minimal, with the island getting winds only up to and a few thundershowers. However, Chantal generated swells of offshore.
=== Tropical Depression Six ===

Tropical Depression Six formed on September 18 from a tropical wave. The depression caused heavy rainfall in the Lesser Antilles, before degenerating into an open tropical wave on September 20 near the Dominican Republic.
=== Tropical Storm Dean ===
A frontal cloud band moved off the East Coast of the United States on September 22. During the next few days, the band became stationary from the Bahamas to beyond Bermuda. A high-pressure area then settled over the northeastern United States, resulting in a strong pressure gradient and winds near gale-force along the east coast. A low-level circulation formed from the frontal cloud band on September 26 about east of central Florida. Dean was first identified late on September 26 as a subtropical storm, though an Air Force reconnaissance flight on the following day only reported winds of at from the center. A pressure of indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. Consequently, the system became a tropical storm late on September 27. Dean&#x27;s winds peaked at on September 28 as it headed northward. Dean&#x27;s circulation turned to the northwest on September 29 then struck the Delmarva Peninsula and dissipated over land on September 30.

Virginia reported rains of with at the border. Rains peaked at at Cockaponset Ranger Station in Connecticut. Damage was limited to minor beach erosion and flooding along the portion of Mid-Atlantic coast states.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1983. Each name used this season was utilized for the first (and, in the case of &quot;Alicia&quot;, only) time.

=== Retirement ===
In the spring of 1984, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Alicia&quot; from the rotating name lists due to the amount of damage and deaths it caused, and it will not be used again for another Atlantic hurricane. &quot;Alicia&quot; was replaced with &quot;Allison&quot; for the 1989 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1983 USD.

<doc id="799294" wikidata="Q3955359" url="?curid=799294" title="Sense Field">
<text>Sense Field was an American post-hardcore band from Southern California, formed in 1990. Originally consisting of vocalist Jon Bunch, guitarist Chris Evenson, guitarist Rodney Sellars, bassist John Stockberger, and drummer Scott McPherson, the band included former members of hardcore punk band Reason to Believe.

Sense Field disbanded in 2004 although briefly reformed for two Revelation Records anniversary shows, as well as a pair of memorial shows in 2016, following the death of Jon Bunch.

==History==
Formed in 1990, Sense Field were one of several contemporary bands to popularize the post-hardcore or &quot;emo&quot; subgenre. The band was initially signed to Revelation Records, releasing three albums: &quot;Sense Field&quot;, &quot;Killed For Less&quot; and &quot;Building&quot;. They signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996, however, problems within the label caused the band to sit in limbo for five years as the label re-staffed multiple times. The band was eventually released from their contract and Sense Field won the right to re-record the album they had originally written for Warner Bros. Records. The album, initially titled &quot;Under The Radar&quot; but released as &quot;Tonight and Forever&quot;, arrived in September 2001 via the Canadian independent label Nettwerk.

While Sense Field had been considered an influential band within their scene since their inception, the band achieved commercial success in 2002 with the single &quot;Save Yourself.&quot; The song was included on the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Tonight and Forever,&quot; as well as the soundtrack to &quot;Roswell&quot;. The success of the song allowed the band to perform on late night television shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, also seeing the song place on numerous 2002 best-of countdowns. The group quickly followed up the release with the 2003 album &quot;Living Outside&quot; which became their only album to chart, reaching #37 on U.S. Heatseekers. Sense Field announced their breakup in January 2004.

===Post break-up===
Following the demise of Sense Field the band members went on to other outfits. Jon Bunch became the vocalist of Further Seems Forever. They released one album with Bunch in the line up before that band also parted ways. Bunch then went on to form the post-hardcore band War Generation, and the tongue-in-cheek punk band Lucky Scars. Original drummer Scott McPherson became a sought-after session and touring player and also was a member of both Elliott Smith and Neil Finn&#x27;s touring bands, Rodney Sellars created the shoegaze revivalist outfit, The Year Zero, Chris Evenson appeared in tandem with The Juliana Theory&#x27;s Brett Detar for a song under the Belasana moniker (featured on 2004&#x27;s &quot;Maybe This Christmas Tree), bass player John Stockberger moved to Texas and became a yoga teacher and later drummer, Rob Pfeiffer, went on to record the theme song for Last Week Tonight.

Jon Bunch died by suicide on January 31, 2016 at the age of 45.

===Reunion shows===
Sense Field reunited for a Revelation Records 25 Year Anniversary Show on Thursday, June 7, 2012 at The Glass House in Pomona, California. As a warm up to that show, they played The Slide Bar in Fullerton, California on Wednesday, June 6, 2012. They also played the Rev 25 show in Chicago on January 6, 2013. All three shows featured mostly original members, except filling in on bass for John Stockberger was Ian Fowles, who also toured the U.S. filling in on guitar for Rodney Sellars in 2003 while supporting &quot;Living Outside&quot;. The band reunited twice more: March 20, 2016 at The Yost in Orange County and June 25, 2016 at The TLA in Philadelphia, with both shows serving as fundraisers for Jon Bunch&#x27;s son, Jack.

<doc id="799305" wikidata="Q624370" url="?curid=799305" title="California State Route 60">
<text>State Route 60 (SR 60) is an east–west state highway in the U.S. state of California. It serves the cities and communities on the eastern side of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and runs along the south side of the San Gabriel Valley. It functions as a bypass route of Interstate 10 (I-10) through the area between the East Los Angeles Interchange in Los Angeles and Beaumont. SR 60 provides a route across several spurs of the Peninsular Ranges, linking the Los Angeles Basin with the Pomona Valley and San Gabriel Valley. The highway also runs concurrently with SR 57 and I-215. Portions of SR 60 are designated as either the Pomona Freeway or the Moreno Valley Freeway.

==Route description==

SR 60 begins at the East Los Angeles Interchange near Downtown Los Angeles, designated as the Pomona Freeway. The freeway heads east from the junction after splitting off from I-10 (Santa Monica Freeway) and passes through East Los Angeles, where it has a four level interchange with I-710 (Long Beach Freeway). Continuing east through the southern San Gabriel Valley, SR 60 passes through many cities and communities, intersecting I-605 (San Gabriel River Freeway) in the City of Industry. It proceeds to overlap with SR 57 (Orange Freeway) in Diamond Bar, right on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley.

A short overlap carries SR 60 traffic on the same roadway as SR 57. The two routes head northeast through an arm of the San Gabriel Valley; after they split, SR 60 ascends slightly and then slopes through the Puente Hills and into the Pomona Valley. Continuing east, SR 60 intersects the Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) in Pomona, I-15 (Ontario Freeway) in Jurupa Valley, and the Riverside Freeway (SR 91/I-215) in Riverside, California.

Another short overlap carries SR 60 traffic on the same roadway as I-215. The two routes head southeast; after the two freeways split, SR 60 is designated the Moreno Valley Freeway. The freeway runs through communities further east in the Inland Empire. After passing through Moreno Valley, SR 60 runs through the rugged hill country to the east (known as the Badlands to the locals). After that, SR 60 downgrades to an expressway and has several at-grade interchanges with local roads. Finally, in Beaumont, SR 60 ends and merges into I-10 (Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway).

SR 60 traverses Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties. As it passes through many of Los Angeles&#x27; eastern suburbs in southern San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, it is a major transportation corridor. For the majority of its length, it is generally parallel to, and south of, the San Bernardino Freeway, I-10, and generally parallel to and north of the Riverside Freeway, SR 91. The rapid population growth exacerbates traffic congestion and, therefore, residential, commercial, and industrial development in the Inland Empire. In particular, it has become increasingly clogged of late with shipping container-laden trucks traveling from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to rail yards and warehouses in the Inland Empire. As a result of the rapid development of the Inland Empire since the 1980s, the Moreno Valley Freeway now suffers from severe traffic congestion. In the mid-2000s, the northwestern section concurrently signed with Interstate 215 underwent significant construction to improve traffic flow, but it still suffers from heavy congestion.

The freeway is known as the Pomona Freeway from its western terminus to its junction with SR 91 and I-215 in Riverside, and the Moreno Valley Freeway east of this interchange until its eastern terminus at its junction with I-10. The route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==

The route takes its number from former US 60, which now begins near Brenda, Arizona, and terminates on the east coast at Virginia Beach, Virginia. Before 1964, US 60 ran from Los Angeles to the Arizona state line, where it continued its nationwide trek, often overlapping US 99 and US 70 along the way. The advent of I-10 created a situation where, at one point, four different signed roads were routed along the state-maintained highway.

In 1964, California implemented a plan to simplify its highway-numbering system, where one state highway had only one route number, and concurrencies were strongly discouraged. As a result, the US 60 designations (along with US 70 and US 99) were removed. I-10 (as Route 10) superseded US 60&#x27;s alignment from Beaumont to the Arizona state line, even though the routing was only partly a freeway. This left the officially designated Route 60 from Beaumont to Los Angeles orphaned from its original U.S. Highway (which to this day begins at a point on I-10 several miles east of Quartzsite, Arizona). This new Route 60 was provisionally signed as a U.S. Highway since the designation would guide motorists from Los Angeles to Arizona without a completed freeway for I-10; when all of Route 10 was upgraded to a freeway, the U.S. Highway designation disappeared.

At least two California highway signs managed to be overlooked for many years afterward. Along eastbound I-10 at the eastern end of the San Gorgonio Pass, US 60 was co-signed with I-10 on the eastbound overhead signage with Indio as the control city at the junction with SR 111. The signage remained as late as 1979 and had appeared in early scenes of the 1980 movie &quot;American Gigolo&quot; where Julian Kay (played by Richard Gere) is en route to Palm Springs on a &quot;substitute&quot; assignment. Replacement overhead signs now have only I-10 with &quot;Indio, other Desert Cities&quot; as the control cities. Another sign on Hess Boulevard at SR 62 in the unincorporated town of Morongo Valley pointed not to I-10, but to US 60 (with evidence of the sign having pointed to both US 70 and US 99 as well) stood through the early 2000s; it has since been removed.

The stretch of SR 60 along the Moreno Valley Freeway made national headlines in April 2004, when five-year-old Ruby Bustamante of Indio and her 26-year-old mother, Norma, were reported missing. Their car had left the road, apparently unwitnessed, between the gap in two guard rails on April 4. It then crashed underneath a tree in a deep ravine. Though Mrs. Bustamante died, presumably at the moment of impact, Ruby survived on her own for ten days on cups of uncooked Top Ramen noodles and bottles of Gatorade which were in the car.

In 1998, the HOV lanes between SR 57 and I-15 opened. In 2005, construction of an HOV lane started between I-605 and Redlands Boulevard in two phases. The construction was finished in 2010 from I-605 to SR 57, and in 2008 from I-15 to Redlands Boulevard. The Grand Avenue (exit 24B) interchange went through some significant construction during this period, which included adding a direct HOV connector to SR 57 and an alternate route for SR 60 west to exit Brea Canyon Road (exit 23). There are no current plans to construct the HOV lanes from I-605 to the East Los Angeles Interchange or Redlands Boulevard to I-10.

On December 14, 2011, a tanker truck carrying of gasoline caught fire and exploded on the Pomona Freeway in Montebello; this caused Caltrans to rebuild the Paramount Boulevard overpass. Shortly after the rebuilding of the bridge, Caltrans did widening work on Paramount Boulevard&#x27;s exit and entrance ramps to accommodate the new bridge and installed new traffic signals. There is also a connection to the Monterey Park Market Place via Neil Armstrong Street, a joint venture between Monterey Park and Montebello, which can be accessed through Paramount Boulevard.

In mid-2016, Caltrans started constructing a partial interchange at Lemon Avenue (to Brea Canyon Road) with no westbound exit. On May 1, 2018, the Lemon Avenue eastbound off-ramp exit and westbound on-ramp were opened, and the eastbound off-ramp exit to Brea Canyon Road was removed. The project was finished in late 2018.

In 2020, Caltrans conducted a freeway rehabilitation project on the freeway from I-710 to I-605. The construction took two years and replaced the deteriorating concrete with new concrete. Construction started in 2020 and finished in 2022. Since the freeway was rehabilitated in sections, the entire median had to be replaced. In addition, as part of this project, Caltrans replaced the freeway signs with retro-reflective ones from the East LA interchange to Fairway Drive. All freeway signs in the median were replaced with new ones on the right hand side. Signs between Fairway Drive and the San Bernardino-Los Angeles county line will be replaced once the widening work on SR 57 is complete.

To increase safety through the Badlands corridor between Moreno Valley and Beaumont, the Riverside County Transportation Commission (RCTC) partnered with Caltrans to complete a $138 million project to add a truck climbing lane in both directions at Gilman Springs Road and Jack Rabbit Trail. Construction began in the summer of 2019 and was completed in May 2022.

==Future==
Construction on the SR 57/SR 60 Interchange Improvements Project in the area around the SR 57/SR 60 overlap began in 2023 and is scheduled to be completed in 2028. The project will add an eastbound bypass lane between SR 57 southbound and Grand Avenue and between SR 57 northbound and Diamond Bar Boulevard. In addition, the Grand Avenue bridge is planned to be replaced with a wider bridge, and the eastbound off ramp will be redesigned. This is to affect the Diamond Bar Golf Course, which has been closed since 2021 to accommodate the freeway expansion. The widening of SR 60 westbound has already been completed. The westbound freeway previously went through a major widening in 2006 and the Grand Avenue/SR 60 westbound interchange had further improvements finished in 2019.

The I-605 Corridor Improvement Project includes plans to reconstruct the SR 60/I-605 interchange. , the project is still going through the approval process.

A groundbreaking ceremony was held for the future Potrero Boulevard interchange near the Jack Rabbit Trail exit of SR 60 on February 1, 2018. It is planned to be Exit 75. There are also plans to convert SR 60 from the Jack Rabbit trail exit to its eastern terminus (I-10) to a full freeway. If this segment is complete, the entire route will be up to Interstate standards. These plans are still only in the environmental phase and have not been approved yet.

<doc id="799306" wikidata="Q2305052" url="?curid=799306" title="Kumiko Nishihara">
<text>is a Japanese voice actress from Chigasaki, Kanagawa affiliated with Aoni Production also known for her work on the stage and Iris Chateaubriand from Sakura Wars.

==Biography==

While a student at Wako University, Nishihara attended voice acting classes run by Kaneta Kimotsuki. When Kimotsuki established in 1984, Nishihara went on to leave her undergraduate studies unfinished to become a founding member, taking numerous roles as a leading actress in several productions and appearing in the lead role of Alice from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; three times. Theatre Company 21st Century Fox became known for producing numerous voice actors with a theatre background such as Kaneta, Nishihara, and Kappei Yamaguchi. Nishihara took on voice acting roles in anime starting with &quot;Little Memole&quot; and becoming known for major voice acting roles in anime such as &quot;Hello! Lady Lynn&quot;, &quot;Sailor Moon Sailor Stars&quot;, and &quot;s-CRY-ed&quot;, in addition to voice acting roles in a number of Japanese games. Nishihara is known for taking on voice acting roles involving high pitched female voices and a great deal of singing, leading to appearances on the Japanese music variety show &quot;Utaban&quot; aired by the Tokyo Broadcasting Corporation.

With her departure from 21st Century Fox in 2004 and transfer of her voice acting work to Aoni Production, Nishihara shifted emphasis from her previously prolific voice acting in anime and the Japanese gaming industry to her stage career. In 2006 together with Junko Okada, Nishihara founded the Liddel Project as an experiment in independent theatre. Nishihara went on to take roles with the newly established , appearing in their first production, &quot;Fractal&quot; and a production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; as the Black Queen. Nishihara continues to be active in contemporary Japanese theatre. Her most recent work with Blanc Chat is &quot;Final Week&quot;, their 14th production since establishment and she is scheduled to appear in a series of Liddel Project performances from November 2012 in Tokyo.

<text>Frank McRae (March 18, 1941 – April 29, 2021) was an American film and television actor and a professional football player.

==Early life==
McRae was born in Memphis, Tennessee. He graduated from Tennessee State University with a double major in drama and history. He was a defensive tackle for the Chicago Bears in the 1967 NFL season appearing in 6 games.

==Career==
Among his acting roles are bank robber Reed Youngblood in &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973); a shouting police captain in &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (1982), a role he later parodied in &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993) and &quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; (1993); the history teacher, Mr. Teasdale, in &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984); James Bond&#x27;s friend Sharkey in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989); and former professional boxing champion Harry Noble in &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot; (1987). He also appeared opposite Sylvester Stallone in 4 films: &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; (1978), &quot;Paradise Alley&quot; (1978), &quot;Rocky II&quot; (1979), and &quot;Lock Up&quot; (1989), as well as a protective trucker in &quot;The Wizard&quot; (1989).

He made an effective pairing with John Candy as two bumbling subordinates; first as two tank soldiers (under an equally bumbling Sgt. Frank Tree played by Dan Aykroyd) in the film &quot;1941&quot; (1979), and later as a &quot;Walley World&quot; security guard in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983). He further showed his comedic abilities as Jim the clumsy mechanic in the cult classic &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980).

<text>is a Japanese actor, voice actor and singer affiliated with Aoni Production. His major roles include Byakuya Kuchiki in &quot;Bleach&quot;, Treize Khushrenada in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, Hisashi Mitsui in &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, Meisuke Nueno in &quot;Hell Teacher Nūbē&quot;, Kunimitsu Tezuka in &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot;, Alucard in &quot;Castlevania&quot;, Zero in &quot;Mega Man X&quot;, Yuu Matsuura in &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot;, Shigure Sohma in &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;, Dark in &quot;D.N. Angel,&quot; Toriko in &quot;Toriko&quot; and Kokushibo in &quot;Demon Slayer&quot;. As a singer, he was one of the members for Entertainment Music Unit from 1995 to 2000. He is married to voice actress Ai Maeda. His range is A～E♯ and his dialect is Osakan. His older sister is an animator. 

He is the official voice-over dub for Scott Foley, Taylor Kitsch, Lin Gengxin and Stephen Fung.

==Biography==
Okiayu was born in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture in 1969, moved to Osaka Prefecture when he was in the third grade of elementary school due to his parents&#x27; work, and lived in Nankō Port Town in Suminoe-ku, Osaka. His father had worked at a movie company for a time before Okiayu was born, and he would sometimes get anime posters and cels from his old colleagues. Because of this environment, Okiayu and his sister, who is one year older than him, loved anime and often listened to theatrical anime records and dramas together. His sister was skilled in the field of drawing, having been involved in animation for some time, but Okiayu found more enjoyment in imitating the voices of characters than in drawing, and he came to feel that speaking dialogue was an interesting thing to do. In his first year of high school after entering Abeno High School, he began to think about becoming a voice actor, and began to request information about training schools, but due to financial reasons, he decided to wait until after graduation and began working part-time during his high school years to save money. However, he spent the money on other things, so he ended up borrowing from his parents to attend the training school. His parents advised him to go to college, but he decided to go to the training school because he had no goals in mind. While there were almost no training schools in Osaka at the time, he auditioned and entered the Aoni Juku Osaka School. He passed an audition for Aoni Production through an in-house screening and moved to Tokyo from Osaka. He is said to have cried when he got the acceptance letter. When he first moved to Tokyo, he went to his cousin&#x27;s place to find a room.

Okiayu claims that his first jobs as a voice actor were a radio commercial for a prep school and the voice of a remote-controlled robot roaming around the Expo &#x27;90 site. His first work in anime was as a Bodkin archer in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and his first regular role was as Franz Heinel in &quot;Future GPX Cyber Formula&quot;. His first starring role was in the OVA &quot;Dark Cat&quot;. The role of Meisuke Nueno in &quot;Hell Teacher Nūbē&quot; was his first leading role in a TV anime. He said that &quot;Nūbē&quot; was the culmination of his career and that he was able to put himself fully into the role and play it naturally because he was close to Meisuke&#x27;s age, and he said he cried when he heard it was over.

Okiayu has taken over some of the roles from late Kaneto Shiozawa, Kazuyuki Sogabe, Tsuyoshi Takishita, and Unshō Ishizuka. Since 2016, he has also been working as a stage actor in the theater company Hero Hero Q Company. In 2023, Okiayu was a recipient of the Best Supporting Actor Award at the 17th Seiyu Awards.

<text>John Richard Schneider (born April 8, 1960) is an American actor and singer. He is best known for his portrayal of Beauregard &quot;Bo&quot; Duke in the American television action/comedy series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (opposite Tom Wopat, Catherine Bach, and James Best), Jonathan Kent in the 2001–2011 TV series &quot;Smallville&quot;, and James &quot;Jim&quot; Cryer on the television series &quot;The Haves and the Have Nots&quot;, created by Tyler Perry.

Alongside his acting career, Schneider has been a country singer since the early 1980s, releasing nine studio albums, a greatest hits package, and eighteen singles. This total includes &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Around Enough to Know&quot;, &quot;Country Girls&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s a Memory Like You&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re the Last Thing I Needed Tonight&quot;, all of which reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts.

==Early life==
John Richard Schneider was born on April 8, 1960, in Mount Kisco, New York, the youngest of three boys of Shirley (Frasier) [Schneider] Conklin (1932–2016) and John &quot;Jack&quot; Richard Schneider III (1930–2013), a pilot who had served in the U.S. Air Force. His mother is from Sanford, Florida. His family included an older brother Robert, an artist living in southern New York. His other brother (also called John) died of lung failure age three, three years before John&#x27;s birth. John&#x27;s life as an entertainer began at the age of eight, when he put on magic shows for his peers and their families. This once got him into trouble, when he had himself chained up and tossed into a swimming pool with the intention of re-creating Harry Houdini&#x27;s legendary escape act. When he was 14, he and his mother moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where his love for performing continued. He went to North Springs High School in Sandy Springs, Georgia.

==Career==
===Acting ===
At the age of 18, he won the role of Bo Duke, working alongside another newcomer Tom Wopat and veteran actor James Best. For his audition, he &quot;borrowed a dilapidated pickup truck, put on a big ol&#x27; country accent and funky hat. I hadn&#x27;t shaved and went in toting a beer. I don&#x27;t know whether they believed it or not, but they liked it.&quot; Schneider learned to drive the iconic Dodge Charger in the show, but to the disappointment of many fans, he admitted he never jumped the car due to the dangerous nature of the stunt.

At the height of the series&#x27; popularity, he also became a recording artist and a face of merchandise. In 1982, a tangle of legal suits with the producers over the distribution of merchandising royalties caused Schneider and co-star Tom Wopat to leave the show for most of a season. They returned to their roles in February 1983 only after their claims were satisfied. The show was canceled in 1985, after seven seasons. Schneider directed the series finale, titled &quot;Opening Night at the Boar&#x27;s Nest,&quot; airing originally on CBS, February 8, 1985.

In 2001, he portrayed Jonathan Kent, the adoptive father of Clark Kent on &quot;Smallville&quot;, starring in 100 episodes. Schneider directed some episodes of &quot;Smallville&quot;, including &quot;Talisman&quot;. Some episodes contain references to Schneider&#x27;s work in &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, e.g. the season five episode &quot;Exposed&quot; is notable for reuniting Schneider with his former &quot;Dukes&quot; co-star Tom Wopat. Schneider guest starred for the latter half of season five appearing in the episodes &quot;Void&quot; and &quot;Oracle&quot;. Schneider returned for the season 10 premiere of &quot;Smallville&quot;, reprising his role as Jonathan Kent in a recurring role.

Schneider has appeared in many films and TV series, including five guest spots on &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and the miniseries &quot;10.5&quot;. He had a recurring role on &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; and made guest appearances on such shows as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

In 2009, Schneider made an appearance on &quot;&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Kill Me If You Can&quot;. He appeared in the first season of &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;, in which his real-life son Chasen Schneider had a recurring role. During the summer of 2008 and early 2009, John portrayed &quot;Marshall Bowman&quot;. He declined to continue through the second season and his character was written off.

In 2010, Schneider appeared in the series &quot;Leverage&quot; as a corrupt music executive in the season three episode &quot;The Studio Job&quot;, and in several episodes of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as a retired military man and father of Keith Watson (Brian Austin Green), the love interest of Bree Van de Kamp.

In 2011, he starred in the film &quot;Doonby&quot;, as a drifter who comes into a small town and makes it better. However, a menacing force stalks him. &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; without the wonderful part,&quot; Schneider explains. &quot;&#x27;Reach down into the throat of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, pull it inside out and make a movie out of it.&quot;

He returned to the role of Bo Duke, alongside Tom Wopat as Luke Duke, in a 2014 commercial for Autotrader.com.

===Filmmaking ===
In addition to acting, John Schneider owns and operates the John Schneider Studios (JSS) where he writes and produces independent films in Holden, Louisiana. John Schneider Studios (JSS) has created an infrastructure to give independent filmmakers all the tools they need to create their stories and films in one location.

===Music===

During Schneider&#x27;s &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; days, he also entered into music. In the early 80s Schneider signed with Scotti Brothers Label and released his debut full-length album, &quot;Now or Never&quot;, which peaked at No. 8 on the US Country Billboard charts. The single &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never,&quot; a remake of the Elvis Presley hit, peaked at number 4 on the US Country Billboard charts and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1981 and is one of the highest charting Elvis covers of all time.

Schneider continued to release albums, including &quot;Quiet Man&quot; and &quot;If You Believe&quot;, and, in 1984, signed with MCA Nashville. Through MCA Nashville, Schneider released &quot;Too Good to Stop Now&quot; which included his first No. 1 hits, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Around Enough to Know&quot; and &quot;Country Girls,&quot; peaking at No. 1 on the CAN Country music charts. In 1985, Schneider unleashed &quot;Tryin&#x27; To Outrun the Wind&quot;, followed by &quot;A Memory Like You&quot; which debuted at No. 1 on the US Country Billboard charts, a first for Schneider.

The album &quot;A Memory Like You&quot; featured &quot;What&#x27;s a Memory Like You (Doing In A Love Like This)&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re The Last Thing I Needed Tonight,&quot; singles which both peaked at No. 1 on the US Country Billboard charts and CAN Country. In the late 80s, Schneider continued releasing albums including his Greatest Hits record. Taking some time off to pursue acting opportunities, Schneider returned with &quot;Worth The Wait&quot;, &quot;John&#x27;s Acoustic Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Promise&quot; and &quot;Home For Christmas&quot;, with &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; co-star Tom Wopat in 2014.
In 2019, on January 29, LIVE, at a filming of the TV show &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight,&quot; John Schneider was Inducted on the air into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
&quot;I hadn&#x27;t done music since 1990. People responded to that music, and one thing led to another,&quot; shares Schneider. &quot;It&#x27;s funny. Even though I had a bunch of No. 1 songs, people say, &#x27;Oh, I love that Dukes of Hazzard song you sang!&#x27; Well, I didn&#x27;t sing it, Waylon Jennings sang it. I&#x27;m famous for music by a song I never sang. Crazy.&quot;

In November 2021, Schneider spoke and performed at Global Vision Bible Church in Wilson County, Tennessee.

In 2023, Schneider competed in season ten of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Donut&quot;. He finished in 2nd place where he also referenced the death of his wife Alicia Allain.

In a February 2024 interview with One America News Network, a far-right TV network, Schneider likened Beyoncé&#x27;s entry into country music to a &quot;dog peeing on a tree.&quot; His comments were criticized as racist.

He said he has had hard financial times and he has spent his money on repairing his studio in Louisiana which was destroyed in an August 2016 flood. He was arrested at 10:29 AM and released at 3:45 PM. The short imprisonment was due to the overcrowded prison. He contrasted the warm treatment of the corrections officers to the &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; treatment he received in the court system. However, he was still ordered to perform 240 hours of community service and pay the debt to Elvira, or else face imprisonment of five years.

On December 21, 2023, Schneider posted a comment on X calling for the prosecution and public hanging of U.S. President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden for treason. The comment was deleted after it drew criticism and the attention of the United States Secret Service, who opened an investigation into the remark. Schneider has publicly denied advocating violence.

<text>The River Torrens (Karrawirra Parri / Karrawirraparri) is the most significant river of the Adelaide Plains. It was one of the main reasons for the siting of the city of Adelaide, capital of South Australia. It flows from its source in the Adelaide Hills near Mount Pleasant, across the Adelaide Plains, past the city centre and empties into Gulf St Vincent between Henley Beach South and West Beach. The upper stretches of the river and the reservoirs in its watershed supply a significant part of the city&#x27;s water supply.

The river is also known by the native Kaurna name for the river—Karrawirra Parri or Karrawirraparri (&quot;karra&quot; meaning redgum, &quot;wirra&quot; meaning forest and &quot;parri&quot; meaning river), having been officially dual-named in 2001. Another Kaurna name for the river was Tarndaparri (Kangaroo river). The river was thought to be a reflection of the Milky Way (&quot;wodliparri&quot;), and was the heartland of the Kaurna people, who lived along its length and around the tributary creeks.

At its 1836 exploration by William Light, an inland bend was chosen as the site of the Adelaide city centre and North Adelaide. The river was first named the Yatala by the initial exploration party, but later renamed to honour Robert Torrens senior, chairman of the board of Colonisation Commissioners for South Australia from 1834 to 1841 (when he was sacked).
From March 1837 settlers camped in tents and makeshift huts along the west end of the River Torrens and freely used the river&#x27;s resources. A Native Location was created on the north banks of the Torrens and indigenous labour was often used by the settlers for tasks such as hewing wood or delivering water. During the early years of settlement, the river acted as both the city&#x27;s primary water source and main sewer, leading to outbreaks of typhoid.

Since European settlement the river has been a frequently touted tourist attraction. The river&#x27;s long linear parks and a constructed lake in the lower stretch are iconic of the city. The river&#x27;s flora and fauna have been both deliberately and accidentally impacted since settlement. In the 19th century, native forests were cleared, gravel removed for construction and many foreign species introduced. With construction of the linear parks, many species native to the river have been replanted, and introduced species have been controlled as weeds.

The river and its tributaries are highly variable in flow, and together drain an area of . They range from sometimes raging torrents, damaging bridges and flooding city areas, to trickles and completely dry in summer. Winter and spring flooding has prompted the construction of flood reduction works. A constructed sea outlet, landscaped linear parks and three holding reservoirs contain peak flow.
==Physiography==
The River Torrens runs largely westward from the Adelaide Hills, through the centre of Adelaide to the Gulf St Vincent. It originates close to the eastern fault scarp of the Mount Lofty Ranges, near Mount Pleasant, approximately above sea level. It runs predominantly along faulted north-south ground structures, which were formed over 250 million years ago during the Paleozoic era then further dislocated during the Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary. There is a subsidence along the Para Fault which also affects the rivers flow. This subsidence was formed in the last two million years, after the Pliocene era.

From its origin to Birdwood the river follows rolling, relatively level country before entering a hilly section that continues to Gumeracha. The river then follows sedimentary rock strata before entering a gorge after Cudlee Creek. It flows through the gorge to Athelstone, passing over the Eden Fault Zone of the Adelaide Hills face and associated escarpment. After the scarp it flows over sedimentary rocks of varying resistance to erosion, which has led to interspersed narrows and broad basins. From the base of the Adelaide Hills to the Adelaide central business district it runs in a shallow valley with a terraced floor, then down the slope of its own alluvial fan. The structure of this fan shows that the river formerly entered Gulf St Vincent via the Port River. Over time the Torrens deposited sediment, choking its own outflow; becoming locked behind coastal sand dunes and forming the swampy areas of the Cowandilla Plains and The Reedbeds.

===Tributaries===
The Torrens is fed by numerous seasonal creeks, which are dry for most of the year in their lower reaches, but prone to occasional flooding during the winter and spring. There are five main creeks that join it from the southern side as it crosses the Adelaide Plains east of Adelaide, and at least five more in its path through the Adelaide Hills.

The plains tributaries, known as First to Fifth Creeks, lie to the east of the city, with First being the most southerly and the rest numbered consecutively northward. They were once named Greenhill, Hallett, Todd, Anstey and Ormsby rivulets respectively, and had Kaurna names before European settlement.

First, Second and Third Creeks have been particularly heavily modified. Some sections have been converted to concrete channels; others run through landscaped private gardens and some run in underground pipes. Much of the original vegetation has disappeared from the creeks, particularly those closest to the city. Introduced species including olives, bamboo, boxthorn, watsonia and blackberries have displaced native flora. There is some risk of flooding from all of these eastern suburbs creeks, as shown by the Floodplain Study, which includes plans and maps drawn up by the City of Burnside and neighbouring councils.

First Creek begins in Cleland Wildlife Park on the western side of Mount Lofty and Crafers, flows north-west through the south-eastern suburbs, past a drop at the Waterfall Gully falls, through Hazelwood and Tusmore Parks, and Marryatville High School, before discharging into the Torrens near Adelaide Zoo. Much of its course through the suburbs has been canalised, some underground. About 7.5% of its flow is diverted as it flows through the Adelaide Botanic Garden to create the First Creek Wetland, a scheme set up to ensure water security and to encourage diversity of flora and fauna in the area, thus helping to maintain healthy urban environments. Botanic Creek runs through the eastern Adelaide parklands from south to north, into the Adelaide Botanic Garden before joining First Creek.

Second Creek arises in the Summertown area of the Adelaide Hills, north of First Creek, and flows through Greenhill, through Slape Gully, entering the more populated suburbs as it flows through the Michael Perry Reserve in Stonyfell and onwards through the eastern suburbs of Erindale, Marryatville, Kensington (open at Borthwick Park) and Norwood, much of it canalised underground as far as St Peters. The St Peters section is an open canal shortly before it joins the Torrens. It was once called Hallet&#x27;s Rivulet. Stonyfell Creek, arising on the eastern boundary of Stonyfell, flows through Kensington Gardens, including an open stretch in the Reserve before again being piped underground under West Terrace, passing under Kensington Park and Beulah Park. It joins Second Creek near the junction of Magill and Portrush Roads.

First and Second Creeks come within about of each other in Marryatville, with formerly only flat land between them.

Third Creek arises near Norton Summit and flows through the suburbs of Magill, Tranmere, Trinity Gardens and Payneham, much of the way underground, before discharging into the Torrens at Felixstow.

Fourth Creek, or Morialta Creek, arises on the other side of Norton Summit, with various tributaries flowing into it from Marble Hill and Lobethal. It is most well known for its falls in Morialta Conservation Park. &quot;Moriatta&quot;, a Kaurna word meaning &quot;ever flowing&quot;, is now the official name of Fourth Creek. This name has been adapted to Morialta, which is now the name of an electoral district, school and the park through which the creek flows.

Fifth Creek arises within the Morialta Conservation Park, runs alongside Montacute Road for some way and discharges into the Torrens at Athelstone.

The largest catchment of the Torrens is Sixth Creek in the Adelaide Hills, which joins the Torrens at Castambul on Gorge Road.

===Water flow===

At the time of European settlement the river was a summertime chain of waterholes bounded by large gum trees. Flowing through the area where the city of Adelaide is sited the river was sometimes invisible beneath its gravel stream bed. It frequently flooded in winter and did not reach the sea, instead ending at coastal dunes where its waters created a vast but shallow freshwater wetlands. These wetlands, known as The Reedbeds after the dominant vegetation, occupied a large area of the western Adelaide Plains and were also fed by other waterways.

The river only flowed to the sea through the Port River, Barker Inlet, and Patawalonga River following heavy rain.

The river&#x27;s catchment area of approximately is the largest of any waterway within the Adelaide region. The upper reaches are used to create a potable water supply for metropolitan Adelaide with the river supplying three of Adelaide&#x27;s eight reservoirs. The upper catchment has an average annual rainfall of between at its eastern end to near Uraidla. The Torrens has a very variable flow leaving early settlers to use trial and error in determining bridge heights, with many bridges consequently being washed away. Due to the variability of Adelaide&#x27;s climate, flow rates can change from a trickle to flood conditions quickly. On 5 June 1889, prior to major flooding, the flow rate before it entered the suburbs was , rising to , eight days later.

Since settlement it has repeatedly flooded, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Adelaide&#x27;s western suburbs were especially prone to flooding due to their location on the river&#x27;s alluvial fan. As development of Adelaide progressed the amount of rainfall required for flooding decreased and consequent damage increased. Increased stormwater runoff, modification of the river&#x27;s banks and other changes all served to exacerbate the problem. Work done by various groups to minimise flooding was often counter productive with the creation of levees, moving and widening channels and other works simply shifting the flooding elsewhere.

Two early floods were, 18 September 1841 which resulted in two people drowning while trying to cross the river at Klemzig, and 22 September 1844, the largest recorded since settlement began, when &quot;Shands&#x27; Brewery&quot; was washed away after the river undermined its foundations. The 1899 flood was particularly widespread with extensive flooding of both the river and its tributaries, after a year with of rain compared to the Adelaide average of . The river flooded market gardens and farms throughout its hills course causing extensive damage. Norwood was inundated to The Parade, Adelaide to Pirie and Rundle Streets, and many areas west of the city were left in a shallow lake. The river ran deep over the weir near Thorndon Park Reservoir, over the Torrens Lake Weir and over the Morphett Street Bridge. The Underdale (or Holbrooks) Bridge was destroyed, the Torrens Lake weir&#x27;s bridge damaged, and the Felixstow Bridge over the Fourth Creek washed away.

==European exploration and naming==

The first European sighting of the river was in November 1836 by an exploration party comprising Lieutenant W.G. Field, John Morphett and George Strickland Kingston. The river was named &quot;The Yatala&quot; by the party but later renamed by Surveyor General Colonel William Light after Robert Torrens, chairman of the South Australian Colonisation Commission. On 29 December 1836 Light announced the location of the new city of Adelaide, inland on the river&#x27;s banks. The first Europeans to explore the Torrens Gorge to the headwaters and sources of the river were Dr George Imlay and John Hill in January 1838.

In recent years the river has been dually known by the indigenous Kaurna people&#x27;s name of &quot;Karra wirra-parri&quot; (meaning river of the Red Gum forest), referring to the dense eucalyptus forest that lined its banks prior to clearing by early settlers. This name, alternatively &quot;Karra-weera&quot;, only referred to the lake section of the river, between Adelaide and North Adelaide. It was known as &quot;Karrundo-ingga&quot; at Hindmarsh, &quot;Witoingga&quot; near the reed beds, and &quot;Yertala&quot; everywhere when in flood, which has survived as Yatala in the naming of various places in Adelaide.

Pirltawardli, now within Park 1/Pitawardli, a location next to the river near the weir, on the western side of North Adelaide, is an area of great historical significance, as the location of a Kaurna camp and later the first Christian mission and school in South Australia. The missionaries documented the Kaurna language, which formed the basis of the 21st-century language revival of the language. The &quot;native location&quot; and school moved from the southern side of the river (now Bonython Park) to the northern side several times.

==Changes after 1836==

During early years of colonisation, the surrounding trees were cut down and the river&#x27;s gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.

Much of the river&#x27;s catchment area consists of cleared farmland with run-off captured in private dams to sustain farming over Adelaide&#x27;s dry summer. Combined with the river&#x27;s use for potable water this has greatly reduced the overall flow especially in the lower river.

===Flood mitigation===
A flood mitigation bill was passed in 1917 to not only combat the damage caused by floods but also the public health risk due to the lack of mains sewerage in the western suburbs. Popular opinion favoured diverting the flood waters into their &quot;natural&quot; outlets of the Port and Patawalonga Rivers. The chief engineer of the department of works favoured a cutting through sand dunes near Henley Beach allowing the river an outlet, mitigating floods and preventing silting of the Port River. He also advocated the construction of a reservoir where the Kangaroo Creek Reservoir is now, to both mitigate floods and provide summer irrigation water for market gardens. Unfortunately the bill lapsed with no action as the government and local councils were unwilling to fund the works. The Millbrook Reservoir opened in 1918 as a summer water source, and flood mitigator if required. A bill was passed in 1923 to enact the earlier plan of cutting through the dunes and adding an upstream regulating weir. Again the bill lapsed due to a lack of commitment from parties on payment.
A major flood in 1931 and another in 1933 led to the latest in a series of government enquiries. In 1934 the &quot;Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works&quot; recommended that an outlet for the river be created to accommodate flows of up to , covering a 1-in-60-year flood. The work was partly financed by a Commonwealth Government grant with the State Government arranging for the balance. The State Government, western and eastern local councils and the Municipal Tramways Trust shared interest costs. The scheme was enacted in 1935 with the construction of the Breakout Creek (also sometimes Breakout Channel) to take the Torrens westwards to the sea, completed in 1937. The scheme involved diversion of the river at Lockleys (near Adelaide Airport), with the original channel blocked and a new channel created to the sea. The reedbeds and swamps were subsequently drained and some of their area is now the site for the suburb of West Lakes.
Based on recommendations in a 1925 report on flood mitigation, work began in the 1960s on the building of the Kangaroo Creek Reservoir, opened in 1969 with a capacity of . It remains the only reservoir damming the river rather than being fed from weirs. The &quot;River Torrens Committee&quot; was formed in 1964 to advise the minister of works on preserving and enhancing the river&#x27;s natural beauty, and developing it for recreational uses. The &quot;River Torrens Acquisition Act 1970–72&quot; was passed, authorising the purchase of land, in some cases back from the top of the river&#x27;s banks.

By 1980, further development along the riverbanks and removal of levées had reduced the outlet&#x27;s capacity to a 1-in-35-year flood. A study showed that a 1-in-200-year flood would inundate 13,000 properties; so the Kangaroo Creek dam&#x27;s level was raised, its spillway modified, the Breakout Creek channel capacity increased and some bridges reinforced. A development plan was approved in 1981 to purchase land along the length of the river, create a flood mitigating linear park and also to modify the Kangaroo Creek dam further. The sea outlet was enlarged to a capacity of which now covered a 1-in-200-year flood. When the O-Bahn Busway was opened, the bridges were designed to cope with this scale of flood, although the two bridges in St Peters would likely be awash.

===Torrens Lake===
The Torrens Lake was created in 1881 with the construction of a weir, landscaping of Elder Park and modification of the river&#x27;s bank and surrounds into an English formal park. The lake forms a centrepiece of many Adelaide events and postcard scenes. Elder Park with its iron rotunda was opened on 28 November 1882. The Rotunda is a largely Glasgow built iron bandstand which was funded by Sir Thomas Elder, the park being named after him.

In 1867, prison labour from nearby Adelaide Gaol was used to build a wooden dam near the site of the current weir. The dam was poorly constructed and almost immediately the Torrens washed it away. Construction of a permanent concrete weir was begun in November 1880 and completed, at a cost of £7,000, in 1881. The sluice gates were closed to begin filling the Torrens Lake on 1 July 1881. At the lake&#x27;s official opening on 21 July 1881 an estimated 40,000, almost the entire population of Adelaide, attended. During the 1889 flood, the weir was overwhelmed, its gates jammed, and in trying to free them the weir&#x27;s designer John Langdon was crippled. The weir was rebuilt from 1928 to 1929 with its footbridge relocated and the centre section replaced. The gates can now be fully raised and the river allowed to flow unimpeded.


The &quot;Popeye&quot; boats are privately owned recreational ferries that operate on the lake between Elder Park and the Adelaide Zoo. The first boat was launched on the Torrens Lake by Gordon Watts in 1935. It was a boat, built on the banks of the Torrens to hold up to 20 passengers and named &quot;Popeye 1&quot;. Watts purchased a former Glenelg cruise boat in 1948 and placed it in service as &quot;Popeye 2&quot;. Over the next two years three new jarrah hulled boats were built at Port Adelaide; carrying 40 passengers each they were numbered &quot;Popeye 3&quot; through &quot;Popeye 5&quot;. Trips on the Popeyes from Elder Park to the zoo became a treasured family outing and the boats hosted weddings and other events. In March 1962 Keith Altman, owner of riverside eatery &quot;Jolley&#x27;s Boathouse&quot;, took over the Popeyes and introduced recreational paddle boats to the river. The Popeyes had a brush with royalty in March 1977 with &quot;Popeye 5&quot; ferrying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip followed by a choir in &quot;Popeye 4&quot;. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser officially launched three new fibreglass models named Popeyes &quot;I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; in 1982 as the wooden boats&#x27; replacements.

===Water use===
In the early days of Adelaide, the Torrens was used for bathing, stock watering, rubbish disposal, water supply and as a de facto sewer and drainage sump. This led to a range of health issues until finally, in 1839, when a dysentery outbreak killed five children in one day, Governor Gawler forbade bathing, clothes washing and the disposal of animal carcases in the Torrens within of town. The quality of the river&#x27;s water was not helped by water supply methods. Carters used to drive water carts into the Torrens to refill. To prevent this the State Government in 1852 built a facility with steam powered pumps and water storage, from which the carters then filled their casks.

The &quot;Waterworks Act&quot; of 1856 was passed to enable damming of the upstream Torrens for water supply purposes. The resulting &quot;Water Commission&quot; arranged the following year for foundations to be laid for a water supply weir from Adelaide near Campbelltown. Unsuitable geology and shoddy work by contractors Frost &amp; Watson led to it being washed away in July 1858 and the site abandoned. Engineer Hamilton was replaced by John England. Government then created a Waterworks Department, which started construction of a weir from the city and reservoir at Thorndon Park in 1859. The weir was completed on 4 June 1860 and the reservoir began supplying piped water in December. Engineer England was found by a Select Committee to have overpaid the contractors and forced to resign. The water was captured at the weir, piped for storage to the Thorndon Park Reservoir then to a water tower at Kent Town. Water from Kent Town storage was distributed via a manually controlled water system, unmetered for its first six years. Within six years 20,000 citizens in Adelaide and Port Adelaide were connected to reticulated water from the Torrens. By 1872, the Hope Valley Reservoir in the foothills of the Adelaide Hills was completed as a storage reservoir, supplied via an aqueduct and tunnel.

Public baths were built in 1861 just north of the current Parliament House. They were supplied with reticulated water from the Torrens and progressively upgraded with the last change a 1940 remodelling including an Olympic-size swimming pool and diving tower. The baths were demolished in 1970 to make way for the Adelaide Festival Centre. The Millbrook Reservoir was constructed high in the Adelaide Hills from 1913 to 1918 submerging the town of Millbrook. An earth bank dam fed by mile long tunnel from a weir on the river at Gumeracha, its elevation allows gravity supply of water to Adelaide&#x27;s eastern suburbs.

===Bridges===
Due to the river&#x27;s path through the centre of Adelaide, transport necessitated the construction of many bridges. Prior to the bridges all crossings had been via fords which proved a dangerous practice in winter and spring. The first bridge was one of timber built in 1839 approximately west of the current City bridge, but destroyed by floods in September 1844. In 1849 £6,000 was allocated to bridge the Torrens. Within four years three wooden bridges had been built and subsequently destroyed in floods. The bridges listed below are from up-river to down-river.

==Flora and fauna==
The river was formerly a food source with yabbies, mussels and small fish, however the reduction in water quality, changing of the river&#x27;s habitat, and introduction of European fish species has led to a reduction in fauna quantity and diversity. Exotic pest species such as the European carp, redfin perch and trout have greatly reduced native fish populations like the big headed gudgeon (&quot;Philypnodon grandiceps&quot;) but native waterfowl are common along the river with Pacific black ducks, Australian wood ducks, black swans, ibis, egrets and herons amongst the more than 100 species seen. The number of exotic waterfowl species such as mallards has reduced in recent years. In places the steep banks of the river are an ideal habitat for long-necked tortoises.

The river, and its tributaries, had a population of water rats (Hydromys chrysogaster) and Australian swamp rats (&quot;Rattus lutreolus&quot;). Water rats remain in reduced numbers, but the introduced black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) and brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) have largely supplanted the natives. The house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;) is now the most common mammal of the Torrens environ.

Widely found native reeds, sedges and rushes along the upper river are bulrush, knobby club rush, spike rush, common reed, sea rush and pale rush. River red gum (&quot;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&quot;) and blue gum (&quot;Eucalyptus leucoxylon&quot;) trees are found along the riverbanks, although sparser than the forest that was seen by European discoverers. Still present are many of the original vegetation species like Sheoak (&quot;Casuarina stricta&quot;), native cherry (&quot;Exocarpos cupressiformis&quot;), native pine (&quot;Callitris preissii&quot;) and Australia&#x27;s floral emblem the golden wattle (&quot;Acacia pycnantha&quot;).

==Today&#x27;s river==
From its source the river flows westwards through Birdwood and Gumeracha. It then continues down through Torrens Gorge entering suburban Adelaide at Athelstone with some of its path paralleled by the O-Bahn Busway. It passes between the city centre and North Adelaide, forming the Torrens Lake between the Adelaide Zoo and a weir opposite Adelaide Gaol. The river then continues the remaining eight kilometres to the sea at Henley Beach South, emptying into Gulf St Vincent via a constructed outlet.

Hope Valley, Millbrook and Kangaroo Creek Reservoirs, which provide water storage for Adelaide, capture the river&#x27;s flow. These reservoirs form part of the Adelaide Hills catchment, which supplies 60% of Adelaide&#x27;s water needs in an average year. Adelaide City Council uses water from the lower river to irrigate the city&#x27;s surrounding parklands. Rubbish accumulation in the lower river is controlled with numerous collection racks, and sediments and other pollutants are filtered through constructed wetlands.

The earliest linear river park in Australia bounds the suburban end of the river. The park is 35 km long with numerous playgrounds walkways and bicycle tracks. On the south bank of the lake, adjacent to the Adelaide Festival Centre, Elder Park is used for the annual Tasting Australia festival, mass singing of christmas carols at the annual &quot;Carols by Candlelight&quot;, and other public events throughout the year. The Popeye tourist boats, small paddle boats and Black Swans of the lake are icons of the area and frequently featured in postcard photographs of the city. Due to now-limited natural river flow and stormwater born organic material, the lower river, (particularly the lake), is often polluted with algal blooms and significant levels of E. coli bacteria in spring and summer. Numerous taskforces have been formed to improve the river&#x27;s water quality, including one created in 2006 by the Minister for the Environment and Conservation.

The river is a used by many for recreation, with the footpaths on the riverbanks often filled with cyclists and joggers. Rowers use the lake for training all year round, and many clubs such as the Adelaide University Boat Club, the Adelaide Rowing Club, and the boat houses of the secondary schools which participate in the annual Head of the River are located upon its banks. Several rowing regattas are held on the Torrens Lake course in the summer months of each year, contested by both club and school crews.

<doc id="799383" wikidata="Q7972043" url="?curid=799383" title="Washington Mean Time">
<text>Washington Mean Time was the time at the meridian through the center of the old dome atop the main building at the old US Naval Observatory at Washington, D.C. This Washington meridian was defined on 28 September 1850 by the United States Congress. The Old Naval Observatory is now on the grounds of the United States Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, southwest of the corner of E and 23rd Streets in Foggy Bottom (north of the Lincoln Memorial). Washington Mean Time was sometimes called Washington Meridian Time. It was never used as the basis of any time zone, although it was the local mean time of the city of Washington before the advent of American time zones on 18 November 1883. It was also used to time astronomical events by users of the &quot;American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac&quot;, first published for the year 1855.

In 1897, well after the Old Naval Observatory closed in 1892, the Coast and Geodetic Survey reported that its meridian was 77°3′2.3″ west of Greenwich, which was quoted for the next 50 years in the list of observatories in the Almanac as . This old Washington meridian was repealed on 22 August 1912. A later version of Washington mean time based on the meridian of the clock room at the exact center of the New Naval Observatory (77°4′2.24″W or ) was still being used in 1950 on a few pages of the &quot;American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac&quot;, even though most of its pages used Greenwich Civil Time, the American name for the midnight epoch Greenwich Mean Time. For astronomical purposes, before 1925 a day was considered to start at noon rather than the previous midnight. Thus to convert times of astronomical events before 1925 given in Washington mean time to modern Universal Time it is necessary to add an additional 12 hours beyond the meridian difference from Washington to Greenwich, totalling more than 17 hours.

<text>Bhubaneswar () is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Odisha. It is located in the Khordha district. The suburban region, especially the old town, was historically often depicted as &quot;Chakra Khetra&quot; and &quot;Ekamra Khetra&quot; (Area adorned with a mango tree). Bhubaneswar is dubbed the &quot;Temple City&quot;, a nickname earned because of many temples which are standing there. In contemporary times, the city is a hub of sports, tourism and IT in the country. 

Although the modern city of Bhubaneswar was formally established in 1948, the history of the areas in and around the present-day city can be traced to the 1st century BCE. It is a confluence of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain heritage and includes several Kalingan temples, many of them from 6th–13th century CE. With Puri and Konark it forms the &quot;Swarna Tribhuja&quot; (), one of Eastern India&#x27;s most visited destinations.

Bhubaneswar replaced Cuttack as the capital on 13 April 1948. The modern city was designed by the German architect Otto Königsberger in 1966. Along with Jamshedpur and Chandigarh, it was one of modern India&#x27;s first planned cities. Bhubaneswar and Cuttack are often referred to as the &#x27;twin cities of Odisha&#x27;. The area formed by the two cities had a population of 1.7 million in 2011. It is categorised as a Tier-2 city. Bhubaneswar and Rourkela are the two cities in smart city mission from Odisha.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Bhubaneswar&quot; is the anglicisation of the actual Odia name &quot;Bhubaneśwara&quot;(ଭୁବନେଶ୍ୱର), derived from the word &quot;Tribhubaneśwara&quot; (ତ୍ରିଭୁବନେଶ୍ୱର), which literally means the Lord (Iśwara) of the Three Worlds (Tribhubana), which in this context refers to Shiva.

== History ==

Bhubaneswar stands near the ruins of Sisupalgarh. Dhauli, near Bhubaneswar was the site of the Kalinga War (-261 BCE), in which the Mauryan emperor Ashoka invaded and annexed Kalinga. One of the most complete edicts of the Mauryan Emperor, Ashoka, dating from between 272 and 236 BCE, remains carved in rock, to the southwest of the modern city. After the decline of the Mauryan empire, the area came under the rule of Mahameghavahana dynasty, whose most well-known ruler is Kharavela. His Hathigumpha inscription is located at the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves near Bhubaneswar. The area was subsequently ruled by several dynasties, including Satavahanas, Guptas, Matharas, and Shailodbhavas.

In the 7th century, Somavamshi or Keshari dynasty established their kingdom and constructed a number of temples. After the Kesharis, the Eastern Gangas ruled Kalinga area until the 14th century CE. Their capital was located in present-day Cuttack City. After them, Mukunda Deva of the Bhoi Dynasty – the last Hindu ruler of the area until the Marathas ruled Odisha from Cuttack. Most of the older temples in Bhubaneswar were built between 8th and 12th centuries, under Shaiva influence. The Ananta Vasudeva Temple is the only old temple of Vishnu in the city. In 1568, the Karrani dynasty of Afghan origin gained control of Odisha . During their reign, most of the temples and other structures were destroyed or disfigured. 

In the 16th century, the area came under pachamani Mughal control. The Marathas, who succeeded the Mughals in the mid-18th century, encouraged pilgrimage in Odisha. In 1803, the area came under British colonial rule and was part of the Bengal Presidency (until 1912), Bihar and Orissa Province (1912–1936) and Orissa Province (1936–1947). The capital of the British-ruled and post-independent Orissa State was also Cuttack, which was vulnerable to floods and suffered from space constraints. Because of this, in 1966, a proposal to move the capital to a new capital was introduced in the Legislative Assembly of the Odisha Province. After independence of India, the foundation of the new capital was laid on 13 April 1948.

The name of the new capital came from &quot;Tribhubaneswara&quot; or &quot;Bhubaneswara&quot; (literally &quot;Lord of the Earth&quot;), a name of Shiva, the deity of the Lingaraja temple. The Legislative Assembly of Odisha was shifted from Cuttack to Bhubaneswar in 1969. Bhubaneswar was built as a modern city, designed by German architect Otto Königsberger with wide roads, gardens and parks. Though part of the city followed the plan, it grew rapidly over the next few decades, outstripping the planning process. According to the first census of independent India, taken in 1951, the town&#x27;s population was just 16,000. From 1952 to 1979, it was administered by a Notified Area Council or a &quot;nagar panchayat&quot;; a municipality was established only on 12 March 1979. During this time, due to fear of wild animals and forested areas, Cuttack continued to be the people&#x27;s favourite destination. The government officials lived at Cuttack and came to Bhubaneswar for work. The government then forced the officials to live at Bhubaneswar. Then some traders came to set up some shops. By the 1991 census, the population of Bhubaneswar had increased to 411,542. Accordingly, on 14 August 1994, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation was established.

== Geography ==

Bhubaneswar is in Khordha district of Odisha. It is in the eastern coastal plains, along the axis of the Eastern Ghats mountains. The city has an average altitude of above sea level. Bhubaneswar lies in Mahanadi River Delta.
The Daya River is 4 km to the south and the Kuakhai River 4 km to the east; the Chandaka Wildlife Sanctuary and Nandankanan Zoo are in west and north to Bhubaneswar, respectively.

Bhubaneswar is topographically divided into western uplands and eastern lowlands, with hillocks in the western and northern parts. Kanjia lake on the northern outskirts, affords rich biodiversity and is a wetland of national importance. Bhubaneswar&#x27;s soils are 65 per cent laterite, 25 per cent alluvial and 10 per cent sandstone. The Bureau of Indian Standards places the city inside seismic zone III on a scale ranging from in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes. The United Nations Development Programme reports that there is &quot;very high damage risk&quot; from winds and cyclones. The 1999 Odisha cyclone caused major damage to buildings, the city&#x27;s infrastructure and cost many human lives. Floods and waterlogging in the low-lying areas have become common due to unplanned growth.
=== Urban structure ===


The Bhubaneswar urban development area consists of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation area, 173 revenue villages and two other municipalities spread over . The area under the jurisdiction of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation covers . The city is somewhat dumbbell-shaped with most of the growth taking place to the north, northeast and southwest. The north–south axis of the city is widest, at roughly . Growth in the east is restricted due to the presence of Kuakhai River and by the wildlife sanctuary in the northwestern part. The city can be broadly divided into the old town, planned city (or state capital), added areas and into Units and Colonies.

The old town or &quot;Temple Town&quot;, the oldest part of the city, is characterised by many temples, including the Lingaraja, Nilakantha Siva, Rajarani and Muktesvara temples, standing alongside residential areas. Additional structures include the Somabaresvara Siva Temple and the Kartikesvara Siva Temple. The area is congested, with narrow roads and poor infrastructure. Among neighbourhoods in the old town are Rajarani Colony, Pandaba Nagar, Brahmeswara Bagh, Lingaraja Nagar, Gouri Nagar, Bhimatangi, Kapilaprasad and Sundarpada.

The planned city was designed in 1948 to house the capital. It is subdivided into units, each with a high school, shopping centres, dispensaries and play areas. While most of the units house government employees, Unit V houses the administrative buildings, including the State Secretariat, State Assembly and the Raj Bhavan. Private residential areas were later built in other areas of the planned city, including Saheed Nagar and Satya Nagar. Unit I, popularly known as the Market Building, was formed to cater to the shopping needs of the new capital&#x27;s residents. Later, markets and commercial establishments developed along the Janpath and Cuttack-Puri Road at Saheed Nagar, Satya Nagar, Bapuji Nagar and Ashok Nagar. A dedicated institutional area houses educational and research institutes, including Utkal University, the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology and Sainik School. Indira Gandhi Park, Gandhi Park and the Biju Patnaik Park are located in the unit.

The added areas are mostly areas lying north of National Highway 5, including Nayapalli, Jayadev Vihar, Chandrasekharpur and Sailashree Vihar, Niladri vihar which were developed by Bhubaneswar Development Authority to house the growing population. With the development of the new areas such as Chandrasekharpur the city is now divided roughly into North (newer areas) and South Bhubaneswar (older areas) by the NH-5 highway.

The peripheral areas are outside the municipal boundary or have subsequently been included within the extended boundary, including Tomando, Patia and Raghunathpur. Most of these areas were developed in a haphazard manner, without proper planning. The Master Planning Branch of the Bhubaneswar Development Authority developed the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) in 2010. According to the Odisha Development Authorities Act, 1982, the Development Authority has control over the planning for municipal areas. Apart from the CDP, BDA has also created Zonal Development Plans for some of the areas under the CDP. Bhubaneswar secured the top rank in the Smart city list in India.

<text>Sergeant First Class Modesto Cartagena de Jesús (July 21, 1921 – March 2, 2010) was a member of the United States Army who served in the 65th Infantry Regiment, a military regiment consisting of Puerto Rican enlisted soldiers and officers from the continental United States also known as &quot;The Borinqueneers,&quot; during World War II and the Korean War, becoming the most decorated Hispanic soldier in that war. He was the most decorated Puerto Rican soldier in history.

==Early years==
Cartagena was born in a poor family, and raised in the mountains of Cayey, Puerto Rico during the Great Depression. Cartagena enlisted in the U.S. Army in San Juan, Puerto Rico and was assigned to the 65th Infantry, also known as The Borinqueneers because, with the exception of the officer staff, it was made up of Puerto Rican enlisted men. During World War II he served in units guarding military installations in the Caribbean and later in the Allied occupation of Germany. Cartagena was discharged after the 65th Infantry Regiment returned to Puerto Rico.

==Korean War==

Upon the outbreak of the Korean War, Cartagena reenlisted and entered the army with the rank of sergeant. He was assigned to Company C, 65th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division and sent to Korea.

The men of the 65th, now attached to the army&#x27;s 3d Infantry Division, were among the first infantrymen to meet the enemy on the battlefields of Korea. After November, 1950, they fought daily against units of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army after the Chinese entered the war on the North Korean side. One of the hardships suffered by the Puerto Ricans was the lack of warm clothing during the cold and harsh winters. Among the battles and operations in which the 65th participated was &quot;Operation Killer&quot; in January 1951, becoming the first regiment to cross the Han River in South Korea during the operation. In April 1951, the Regiment participated in the Uijonbu Corridor drives.

He earned the nickname &quot;One Man Army&quot;. On April 19, 1951, Cartagena, &quot;with no regard for his own safety,&quot; as the official record states, left his position and charged directly into devastating enemy fire, single-handedly destroying two enemy emplacements on Hill 206 near &quot;Yonch&#x27;on,&quot; North Korea. After taking out the emplacements, he was knocked to the ground twice by exploding enemy grenades. Nevertheless, he got up and attacked three more times, each time destroying an enemy emplacement until he was wounded. On October 19, 2002, during a ceremony honoring the 65th Infantry, when he was asked about the battle, Cartagena responded that he just hurled back at the Chinese the grenades thrown at him. He thought that the rest of the squad was behind him, and didn&#x27;t realize most of them had been wounded and forced to take cover. Later they found 33 dead Chinese in the machine gun and automatic emplacements and they found 15 more dead in the positions he had destroyed on his way up the hill. Cartagena, who had lost a lot of blood, was sent to Taibu in a helicopter and then to Japan to the 128th Station Hospital where he was hospitalized for 62 days. According to 1st Lt. Reinaldo Deliz Santiago: 

Cartagena was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross which is the second-highest military decoration of the United States Army (second to the Medal of Honor), awarded for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force.

==Distinguished Service Cross citation==

==Later years==
Cartagena spent 20 years in the army before retiring as a sergeant first class in 1971. He continued to be an active figure around the 65th Infantry headquarters in Puerto Rico long after his retirement. He also had family in El Paso, Texas. His family, upon learning of Modesto&#x27;s actions, had taken it upon themselves to make a request to Congress that he be awarded the Medal of Honor. They received support on this quest from the Republican Veterans Committee. His supporters argued that the segregation policy of the army, at the time, and the limited English capacity of his company members when filling out the forms for the application, resulted in the awarding of the nations&#x27; second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross.

On March 2, 2010, the day that Puerto Rico commemorated the 93rd anniversary of American citizenship, Cartagena died in his home in the town of Guayama, of a heart attack following a long battle with stomach cancer, he is survived by his sisters María and Virginia and his children Modesto Jr., Luis Antonio, Fernando, Sara, Wilma and Víctor. Cartagena was buried with military honors in the Puerto Rico National Cemetery located in the city of Bayamon. While no Federal government representative attended the interment ceremony for this highly decorated veteran, Puerto Rico&#x27;s second-highest official, Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock attended. He delivered to Cartagena&#x27;s family a personal letter from Governor Luis Fortuño and stated that while Cartagena was actually being buried with a Distinguished Service Cross, &quot;in our hearts we&#x27;re sending him off with the Medal of Honor he deserves&quot; and made a commitment to seek it posthumously.
==Legacy==
January 4, 2007, was officially declared as &quot;SFC Modesto Cartagena Day&quot; in the city of Hartford, Connecticut. The proclamation by Mayor Eddie A. Perez can be viewed here: &quot;SFC Modesto Cartagena Day&quot; Proclamation. An avenue in his native town of Cayey is named after him. On April 14, 2021, USAG Fort Buchanan dedicated the base Visitor Control Center building in honor of SFC Modesto Cartagena.

In 2019 Modesto Cartagena was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.

<text>Primož Peterka () is a Slovenian former ski jumper who competed from 1996 to 2011. He is one of the most successful athletes from Slovenia, having won fifteen individual World Cup competitions, two consecutive overall World Cup titles, a Ski Flying World Cup title, and the Four Hills Tournament.

==Career==
Peterka started ski jumping on a small hill (with a K-point at around 20 metres) near his hometown of Moravče, a small town about 30 km northeast from Ljubljana. He later joined the Triglav ski club in Kranj.

===1995–1996===
Peterka made his World Cup debut on 4 January 1996. Due to the poor performance of Slovenian competitors at the time, Peterka was brought in as a replacement for the Four Hills Tournament event in Innsbruck, where he finished eighth. Peterka continued his good form, winning the competitions in Zakopane and Falun, and finished the season tenth overall. He also finished second behind Michael Uhrmann at the 1996 Junior World Championships.

===1996–1997===
The 1996–97 season was a great success for Peterka. He won seven individual World Cup competitions and won both the overall World Cup title and the Four Hills Tournament. He also finished first in the ski flying standings. On 9 February 1997, Peterka became the first Slovenian to record a jump over 200 metres, landing at 203 metres in Kulm.

===1997–1998===

In the 1997–98 season, Peterka won four individual competitions and a second consecutive World Cup title, defeating Kazuyoshi Funaki in the final competition of the season. At the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Peterka claimed fifth place in the individual large hill competition and sixth in the individual normal hill competition.

===Later career===
In the 2001–02 World Cup season, Peterka returned to the ski jumping elite. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he won the bronze team medal. The 2002–03 season was also successful, with Peterka winning two individual events (Kuusamo and Garmisch-Partenkirchen) and finishing the season seventh overall.

From 2004 onwards, Peterka never finished in the top 10 in an individual World Cup event. However, at the 2005 World Championships in Oberstdorf he won another bronze team medal for Slovenia, together with Jure Bogataj, Rok Benkovič and Jernej Damjan. This made Peterka the first Slovenian ski jumper to win medals both at the Olympics and at the World Championships. After the 2010–11 season, Peterka officially retired from competitive ski jumping.

==Personal life==
Peterka was born in Prikrnica, near Ljubljana, Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia). 

His younger brother Uroš was also a ski jumper.

===Individual wins===
==In popular culture==
Three sports documentary films have been made about his life and career. The first is called &quot;Vleci, Primož&quot; () and was directed by Beno Hvala in 1997, detailing the story of Peterka&#x27;s early career. The second, &quot;Peterka: leto odločitve&quot; (), was directed by Vlado Škafar in 2003 and focuses on Peterka&#x27;s personal crisis and his struggle to find his way back to the top. The third was made in 2011 by RTV Slovenija, called &quot;Skoki so moje življenje&quot; (), directed by Tomaž Kovšca and starring Aleš Potočnik and Polona Bertoncelj.

<text>The Wärtsilä RT-flex96C is a two-stroke turbocharged low-speed diesel engine designed by the Finnish manufacturer Wärtsilä. It is designed for large container ships that run on heavy fuel oil. Its largest 14-cylinder version is 13.5 meters high, 26.59 meters long, weighs over 2,300 tonnes, and produces 80.08 megawatts. The engine is the largest reciprocating engine in the world.

The 14-cylinder version first entered commercial service in September 2006 aboard the &quot;Emma Mærsk&quot;. The design is similar to the older RTA96C engine, but with common rail technology (in place of traditional camshaft, chain gear, fuel pump and hydraulic actuator systems). This provides maximum performance at lower revolutions per minute (rpm), reduces fuel consumption and emits lower levels of harmful emissions.

The engine has crosshead bearings so the always-vertical piston rods create a tight seal under the pistons. Consequently, the lubrication of the engine is split: the cylinders and the crankcase use different lubricants, each being specialised for its designated role. The cylinders are lubricated by continuous timed injection of consumable lubricant, formulated to protect the cylinders from wear and to neutralise the acids formed during combustion of the high-sulfur fuels commonly used. The crosshead design reduces sideways forces on the piston, keeping diametral cylinder liner wear down to about 30 μm per 1,000 hours.

As a piston descends, it compresses incoming combustion air for the adjacent cylinders. This also serves to cushion the piston as it approaches bottom dead centre, thereby removing some load from the bearings. The engine is uniflow-scavenged by way of exhaust valves that are operated by electronically controlled hydraulics, thus eliminating the camshaft. 

As of 2006, more than 300 RT-flex96C engines and older RTA96C engines were in service or on order.

<doc id="799395" wikidata="Q5605893" url="?curid=799395" title="Greg Laurie">
<text>Greg Laurie (born December 10, 1952) is an American evangelical pastor, evangelist, and Christian author who serves as the senior pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship, based in Riverside, California. He also is the founder of Harvest Crusades. Laurie is also the subject of the 2023 film &quot;Jesus Revolution&quot;, which tells the story of how he converted to Christianity and got his start in ministry in the midst of the Jesus movement.

== Early life and education ==
Greg Laurie was born in Long Beach, California. He was raised by a single mother married seven times total; they moved often, sometimes to vastly different locations such as New Jersey and Hawaii. He worked as a newspaper boy for the &quot;Daily Pilot&quot; in Orange County, California. Laurie was not raised in the Christian faith or a church environment. In 1970, when Laurie was 17 years old, he became a devout Christian while attending Newport Harbor High School under the ministry of evangelist Lonnie Frisbee, as the Jesus Movement was exploding in Southern California.

== Ministry ==
In 1973, at the age of 20, under the mentorship of Calvary Chapel pastor Chuck Smith, Laurie was given the opportunity to lead a Bible study of 30 people in Riverside, California. The group quickly grew in size, and that same year, Laurie founded the Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, where he still serves as senior pastor.

In 1990, Laurie founded the Harvest Crusades, an organization that hosts large-scale evangelistic events around the U.S.

Laurie serves on the board of directors for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He is also a chaplain for the Newport Beach Police Department. In 2013, Laurie served as the Honorary Chairman of the National Day of Prayer Task Force. President Donald Trump selected Pastor Laurie as one of several evangelical church leaders to participate in the National Prayer Service hosted at the Washington National Cathedral following the presidential inauguration of 2017.

In 2017, Greg Laurie organized a movement titled &quot;The Year of Good News&quot;. Multiple church leaders signed the letter he penned to initiate the movement. One paragraph of the letter reads, &quot;In a time of fake news, distracting news, divisive news, disorderly news, and, sometimes, depressing news, we—as Christians and as leaders—want to recommit ourselves to making sure that the Good News of Jesus cuts through it all. We call upon Christians in America to make 2017 &#x27;The Year of Good News.&#x27;&quot;

In 2017, Harvest Christian Fellowship became a member of the Southern Baptist Convention, at the request of Laurie, who considered that the latter has important national and international evangelistic programs. The church maintains its ties with Calvary Chapel.

== Harvest at Home and COVID-19 ==
When all California churches were forced temporarily to shut their doors because of COVID-19, Harvest Christian Fellowship and Greg Laurie started the online church program &quot;Harvest at Home&quot;, which swiftly became one of the most-watched internet worship services in America, averaging over 200,000 viewers weekly during the pandemic.

On Palm Sunday 2020, then-president Trump tweeted that he would be watching Harvest at Home, and the webcast saw record viewership that week, with over 1,300,000 people tuning in to watch.

On October 5, 2020, Laurie revealed that he had contracted COVID-19, and released a statement saying, &quot;Unfortunately, the coronavirus has become very politicized. I wish we could all set aside our partisan ideas and pull together to do everything we can to defeat this virus and bring our nation back.&quot;

Harvest at Home continues to be one of the most widely watched online church services in America since the pandemic, with average viewership of over 100,000 in 2023.

== Publishing and media ==
Laurie has written more than 70 books, including &quot;The Upside-Down Church&quot; (1999, co-authored with David Kopp); this book won a Gold Medallion Book Award in the &quot;Christian ministry&quot; category in 2000.

Laurie&#x27;s sermons are featured on the syndicated half-hour daily program &quot;A New Beginning&quot;, broadcast on over 1,100 radio stations worldwide. &quot;A New Beginning&quot; is also featured as a Christian podcast, available on iTunes. Laurie is also a guest commentator at WorldNetDaily and appears regularly in a weekly television program called &quot;GregLaurie.tv&quot; on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN).

In 2018, he published the autobiographical book &quot;Jesus Revolution&quot;, which was adapted for the cinema in 2023. The film, also titled &quot;Jesus Revolution&quot;, is produced by Kingdom Story Company and Lionsgate. It depicts the story of how Laurie and his wife Cathe came to faith during the Jesus Movement in Southern California.

== Personal life ==
Laurie resides in Newport Beach with his wife, Catherine. The couple had two sons, Christopher and Jonathan, as well as five grandchildren. On July 24, 2008, Christopher was killed at the scene of a 9 a.m. car accident on the eastbound Riverside Freeway west of Serfas Club Drive in Corona, California. He was 33 years old.

== Recognition ==
Laurie holds two honorary doctorates, from Biola University and from Azusa Pacific University.

== Films ==
Greg Laurie has produced or written six films:

* &quot;Lost Boy&quot; 
* &quot;Hope for Hurting Hearts&quot; 
* &quot;A Rush of Hope&quot; 
* &quot;Steve McQueen: American Icon&quot; 
* &quot;Johnny Cash: The Redemption of an American Icon&quot; 
* &quot;Jesus Revolution&quot; (2023) 

He is working on a seventh documentary, about fame and faith.

<text>David Finlay Breashears (December 20, 1955 – March 14, 2024) was an American mountaineer, filmmaker, author and motivational speaker. In 1985, he reached the summit of Mount Everest a second time, becoming the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest more than once. He is perhaps best known as the director and cinematographer of &quot;Everest&quot; (1998)—which became the highest-grossing IMAX documentary—and for his assistance in the rescue efforts during the 1996 Everest disaster, which occurred during the film&#x27;s production.

== Early life ==
Breashears was born on December 20, 1955 in Fort Benning, Georgia, the son of a United States Army officer.

==Career==

===Mountaineering, filmmaking, and photography===
In 1983, Breashears transmitted the first live pictures from the summit of Mount Everest, and in 1985, he became the first American to reach its summit more than once. Breashears made eight expeditions to Everest, reaching the summit five times.

Breashears also climbed to the summit of Ama Dablam in the Himalayas, and is known in climbing circles for having free-climbed some of the most technically challenging rock walls in Colorado as a young man. His first free ascent, and on-sight, of the largely unprotected traditional climbing route &quot;Perilous Journey&quot; 5.11b X on Eldorado Mountain in 1975, was one of the boldest ascents of the 1970s.

In 1985, Breashears guided Richard Bass to the summit of Everest; with this, Bass completed the first-ever ascent of the Seven Summits (the highest summit on each of the seven continents).

Breashears also worked on feature films including &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; (1993) and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1997), as well as David Lee Roth&#x27;s &quot;Just Like Paradise&quot; music video and numerous documentaries, such as the award-winning TV documentary &quot;Red Flag over Tibet&quot;. He received four Emmy awards for achievement in cinematography.

Combining his interests and skills in climbing, filmmaking, and photography, he directed, starred in, and produced the acclaimed IMAX film &quot;Everest&quot; (1998), and contributed still photos to the best selling book &quot;Everest: Mountain Without Mercy&quot; (1997). He also produced the first live audio Webcast from Everest&#x27;s summit for the &quot;Nova&quot; television program, &quot;Everest: The Death Zone&quot; (1998). Additionally, Breashears made the film &quot;Kilimanjaro: To the Roof of Africa&quot; (2002).

Breashears&#x27; documentary film, &quot;Storm Over Everest&quot; (May 13, 2008), shown on PBS &quot;Frontline&quot;, features photography on the mountain, interviews with survivors of the three climbing teams that were caught in the 1996 storm, and music composed by Jocelyn Pook. During the filming of the documentary in 2006, Breashears summitted Everest a fifth time. He also documented his personal reactions to climbing Everest again, while filming the &quot;Nova&quot; documentary, in &quot;Epilogue to the 1996 Everest disaster&quot;.

===Publications===
Breashears was the author of several books, including an autobiography, &quot;High Exposure: An Enduring Passion for Everest and Unforgiving Places&quot; (1999).

Breashears also wrote the article, &quot;Every Man For Himself?&quot;, published in &quot;American Alpine Journal&quot; (1988).

===Work with organizations===
Breashears was a director of Destination Himalaya, a travel firm specializing in adventure travel to Himalayan countries.

In 2007, Breashears founded GlacierWorks, a non-profit company that uses science, art, and adventure to raise awareness about climate change in the Greater Himalaya.

==Personal life and death==
Breashears was married to fellow adventurer Veronique Choa in 1986. They divorced, and Breashears lived in Marblehead, Massachusetts when not climbing. He died at his home in Marblehead on March 14, 2024, at the age of 68.

<text>This is a list of important publications in economics, organized by field.

Some basic reasons why a particular publication might be regarded as important:
*Topic creator – A publication that created a new topic
*Breakthrough – A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly
*Influence – A publication which has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of economics.

== Political economy and economics ==

===&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;===
* Adam Smith
* An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776.

Description: The book is usually considered to be the beginning of modern economics. It begins with a discussion of the Industrial Revolution. Later it critiques the mercantilism and a synthesis of the emerging economic thinking of his time. It is best known for the idea of the invisible hand, although this idea is only mentioned once in the book. Smith was critical of the &quot;vile maxim&quot; of the &quot;masters of mankind&quot;, all for themselves and nothing for other people. The Butcher, the Baker, and the Brewer provide goods and services to each other out of self-interest; the unplanned result of this division of labor is a better standard of living for all three.

Importance: Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence, Introduction

===&quot;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot;===
* David Ricardo
* On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, 1817.

Description: Elaborates, clarifies and corrects previous theories, and adds important new concepts

Importance: Breakthrough, influence (esp on Marx), broadened scientific foundations of economics

===&quot;Das Kapital&quot;===
* Karl Marx
* Das Kapital, 1867
*Annotations, Explanations and Clarifications to Capital.

Description: A political-economic treatise by Karl Marx. Marx wrote this critical analysis of capitalism and of the political economy from the perspective of historical materialism, the view that history can be understood as a sequence of modes of production in which exploiting classes extract an economic surplus from exploited classes.

Importance: Breakthrough, Influence

===&quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;===
* Henry George
* Progress and Poverty, 1879.

Description: Describes how poverty in the midst of plenty results from unequal rights to use natural resources, and declining wages in the face of increasing labor productivity results from the Law of Rent. Advocated Georgism, specifically a land value tax.

Importance: Influence, Breakthrough...

=== Principles of Economics (Menger) ===
* Carl Menger, 1871. &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, trans. from German, 1981.
* Link to German version

&quot;Influence&quot;: Credited with co-founding of marginal utility analysis and the Austrian School of economics.

=== Principles of Economics (Marshall) ===
* Alfred Marshall, 1890. &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, 8th ed., 1920.

&quot;Influence&quot;: Standard text for generations of economics students.

=== Economics ===
* Paul A. Samuelson, 1948. &quot;Economics: An Introductory Analysis&quot;
* _____ and William D. Nordhaus &quot;Economics&quot;, 19th ed. McGraw-Hill.

Importance:: Influential multi-level, best-selling principles textbook that popularized neoclassical synthesis of Keynesian economics and neoclassical economics.

== Microeconomics ==

===&quot;Value and Capital&quot;===
* John R. Hicks
* Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1939, 1946, 2nd ed.

Description: See Importance.

Importance: The book &quot;built&quot; on ordinal utility and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the substitution effect and the income effect for an individual in demand theory in the 2-good case. It generalized analysis to the case of one good and all other goods, that is, the &quot;composite good&quot;. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the aggregation problem, most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced general equilibrium theory to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.

==Macroeconomics==
Among the most important list of publication in macroeconomics are:

===&quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;===
* John Maynard Keynes, &quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, 1936

Description: In this book, Keynes put forward a theory based upon the notion of aggregate demand to explain variations in the overall level of economic activity, such as were observed in the Great Depression. The total income in a society is defined by the sum of consumption and investment; and in a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment.

Importance: Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence

===&quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot;===
* Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot;, 1963

Description: Friedman and Schwartz used changes in monetary aggregates to explain business cycle fluctuations in the United States economy.

Importance: Influence

==Game theory==

===Theory of Games and Economic Behavior===
* John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern
* Princeton University Press, 1944

Description: The book by the mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern. It contained a mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy.

This is now a classic work, upon which modern-day game theory is based. Game theory has since been widely used to analyze real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. It is today established, both throughout the social sciences and in a wide range of other sciences.

Importance: Topic creator, Influence

==Mathematical economics==

===Foundations of Economic Analysis===
* Paul A. Samuelson
* Harvard University Press (1947, Enlarged ed. 1983)

The book showed how operationally meaningful theorems can be described with a small number of analogous methods, thus providing &quot;a general theory of economic theories.&quot; It moved mathematics out of the appendices (as in John R. Hicks&#x27;s Value and Capital) and helped change how standard economic analysis across subjects could be done with the same mathematical methods.

Importance and Influence: Accelerated change in standard methods

<text>In plane geometry, a shear mapping is an affine transformation that displaces each point in a fixed direction by an amount proportional to its signed distance from a given line parallel to that direction. This type of mapping is also called shear transformation, transvection, or just shearing. The transformations can be applied with a shear matrix or transvection, an elementary matrix that represents the addition of a multiple of one row or column to another. Such a matrix may be derived by taking the identity matrix and replacing one of the zero elements with a non-zero value.

An example is the linear map that takes any point with coordinates formula_1 to the point formula_2. In this case, the displacement is horizontal by a factor of 2 where the fixed line is the -axis, and the signed distance is the -coordinate. Note that points on opposite sides of the reference line are displaced in opposite directions.

Shear mappings must not be confused with rotations. Applying a shear map to a set of points of the plane will change all angles between them (except straight angles), and the length of any line segment that is not parallel to the direction of displacement. Therefore, it will usually distort the shape of a geometric figure, for example turning squares into parallelograms, and circles into ellipses. However a shearing does preserve the area of geometric figures and the alignment and relative distances of collinear points. A shear mapping is the main difference between the upright and slanted (or italic) styles of letters.

The same definition is used in three-dimensional geometry, except that the distance is measured from a fixed plane. A three-dimensional shearing transformation preserves the volume of solid figures, but changes areas of plane figures (except those that are parallel to the displacement). 
This transformation is used to describe laminar flow of a fluid between plates, one moving in a plane above and parallel to the first.

In the general -dimensional Cartesian space the distance is measured from a fixed hyperplane parallel to the direction of displacement. This geometric transformation is a linear transformation of that preserves the -dimensional measure (hypervolume) of any set.

==Definition==

===Horizontal and vertical shear of the plane===

In the plane formula_3, a horizontal shear (or shear parallel to the -axis) is a function that takes a generic point with coordinates formula_1 to the point formula_5; where is a fixed parameter, called the shear factor.

The effect of this mapping is to displace every point horizontally by an amount proportionally to its -coordinate. Any point above the -axis is displaced to the right (increasing ) if , and to the left if . Points below the -axis move in the opposite direction, while points on the axis stay fixed.

Straight lines parallel to the -axis remain where they are, while all other lines are turned (by various angles) about the point where they cross the -axis. Vertical lines, in particular, become oblique lines with slope formula_6 Therefore, the shear factor is the cotangent of the shear angle formula_7 between the former verticals and the -axis. (In the example on the right the square is tilted by 30°, so the shear angle is 60°.)

If the coordinates of a point are written as a column vector (a 2×1 matrix), the shear mapping can be written as multiplication by a 2×2 matrix:
: formula_8

A vertical shear (or shear parallel to the -axis) of lines is similar, except that the roles of and are swapped. It corresponds to multiplying the coordinate vector by the transposed matrix:

:formula_9

The vertical shear displaces points to the right of the -axis up or down, depending on the sign of . It leaves vertical lines invariant, but tilts all other lines about the point where they meet the -axis. Horizontal lines, in particular, get tilted by the shear angle formula_7 to become lines with slope .

====Composition====
Two or more shear transformations can be combined.

If two shear matrices are formula_11 and formula_12

then their composition matrix is
formula_13
which also has determinant 1, so that area is preserved.

In particular, if formula_14, we have

formula_15

which is a positive definite matrix.

===Higher dimensions===
A typical shear matrix is of the form
formula_16

This matrix shears parallel to the axis in the direction of the fourth dimension of the underlying vector space.

A shear parallel to the axis results in formula_17 and formula_18. In matrix form:
formula_19

Similarly, a shear parallel to the axis has formula_20 and formula_21. In matrix form:
formula_22

In 3D space this matrix shear the YZ plane into the diagonal plane passing through these 3 points: formula_23 formula_24 formula_25 
formula_26

The determinant will always be 1, as no matter where the shear element is placed, it will be a member of a skew-diagonal that also contains zero elements (as all skew-diagonals have length at least two) hence its product will remain zero and will not contribute to the determinant. Thus every shear matrix has an inverse, and the inverse is simply a shear matrix with the shear element negated, representing a shear transformation in the opposite direction. In fact, this is part of an easily derived more general result: if is a shear matrix with shear element , then is a shear matrix whose shear element is simply . Hence, raising a shear matrix to a power multiplies its shear factor by .

====Properties====
If is an shear matrix, then:
* has rank and therefore is invertible
* 1 is the only eigenvalue of , so and 
* the eigenspace of (associated with the eigenvalue 1) has dimensions.
* is defective
* is asymmetric
* may be made into a block matrix by at most 1 column interchange and 1 row interchange operation
* the area, volume, or any higher order interior capacity of a polytope is invariant under the shear transformation of the polytope&#x27;s vertices.

===General shear mappings===
For a vector space and subspace , a shear fixing translates all vectors in a direction parallel to .

To be more precise, if is the direct sum of and , and we write vectors as

:formula_27

correspondingly, the typical shear fixing is
:formula_28
where is a linear mapping from into . Therefore in block matrix terms can be represented as

:formula_29
==Applications==
The following applications of shear mapping were noted by William Kingdon Clifford:
:&quot;A succession of shears will enable us to reduce any figure bounded by straight lines to a triangle of equal area.&quot;
:&quot;... we may shear any triangle into a right-angled triangle, and this will not alter its area. Thus the area of any triangle is half the area of the rectangle on the same base and with height equal to the perpendicular on the base from the opposite angle.&quot;

The area-preserving property of a shear mapping can be used for results involving area. For instance, the Pythagorean theorem has been illustrated with shear mapping as well as the related geometric mean theorem.

Shear matrices are often used in computer graphics.

An algorithm due to Alan W. Paeth uses a sequence of three shear mappings (horizontal, vertical, then horizontal again) to rotate a digital image by an arbitrary angle. The algorithm is very simple to implement, and very efficient, since each step processes only one column or one row of pixels at a time.

In typography, normal text transformed by a shear mapping results in oblique type.

In pre-Einsteinian Galilean relativity, transformations between frames of reference are shear mappings called Galilean transformations. These are also sometimes seen when describing moving reference frames relative to a &quot;preferred&quot; frame, sometimes referred to as absolute time and space.

<text>Roald Jensen (11 January 1943 – 6 October 1987), nicknamed &quot;Kniksen&quot;, was one of Norway&#x27;s most celebrated football players. He played for SK Brann and Heart of Midlothian F.C. (&quot;Hearts&quot;). &quot;Knicksen&quot; is a local Bergen word meaning &quot;juggler&quot;.

From an early age, Jensen was interested in football. He made his senior-team debut with Brann in 1960, while still only 17. He made his debut for the Norway national team the same year. Brann, with Jensen, won the league in 1961–62 and in 1963. After Brann&#x27;s relegation in 1964, Jensen transferred to professional football in Scotland as Heart of Midlothian&#x27;s first non-British player. While he was in Scotland, Jensen was unable to play for Norway, as the national team did not allow professional players at that time.

In 1971 Jensen returned to Brann and won the Norwegian championship (cup) with the club in 1972. Jensen retired from football after the 1973 season, when he was 30 years old. Jensen died in 1987 while playing football for Brann&#x27;s old-boys&#x27; team. The Kniksen award, a prize that acclaims the best players in Norwegian football, is named after Jensen. In 1995 a statue of Jensen was erected outside Brann Stadion in Bergen.

==Early life==
Roald Jensen was born in Bergen, Norway and grew up at Eidsvågsneset, Bergen. He was the son of architect Karl Ingolf Jensen and Kirsten Alice Rokne.
His brother Kjell Jensen was also a footballer.
As a child, Jensen played in the garden with a football for hours on end. In the SK Brann club biography, &quot;Gje meg en B - !, Boka om Brann&quot;, he describes a situation when he lost a small ball he got when he was four years old as the most unhappy time of his life. When he was ten years old, he was a founding member of a football club called Dynamo. In a game Dynamo won 22–0, Jensen scored 15 goals. Jensen was also a member of the &quot;buekorps&quot; (&quot;Archery Brigade&quot;) Nordnæs Bataillon.

Jensen joined Brann at age 13, and dominated on the club&#x27;s youth teams. Even as a youth player, he was noticed for his extreme technical skills. In 1959, SK Brann&#x27;s junior team won the National Championship. The final at Brann Stadion was attended by 16,000 people.

Jensen finished high school and attended Bergen Technical School for two years, before he decided to concentrate on football.

==Senior career==

===SK Brann (1960–1964)===

Jensen played his first senior match for Brann against Viking in April 1960. Because he was only 17, the club had to get a special permit in order to use him. He played all six of the remaining games of the 1959–60 league season, scoring two goals. Despite Roald Jensen&#x27;s early success, Brann was relegated to the regional league &quot;Landsdelserien&quot; (&quot;Regional series&quot;). Roald Jensen played all eight games in the &quot;Landsdelserien&quot; in the fall of 1960. Roald Jensen soon became famous for his ball control and his accurate shots and passes. He became Norway&#x27;s biggest sports star and a darling of the media, and earned the moniker &quot;Kniksen&quot;, which translates into &quot;juggler&quot; in English.
After the 1961 spring season, Brann were promoted from &quot;Landsdelserien&quot;. The Norwegian League system was reorganized, and the autumn season was the start of a marathon campaign that lasted throughout 1962. Ten out of 30 games were played that autumn, and Jensen was on the pitch in all of the games, scoring five goals. Jensen also played in all of Brann&#x27;s games in the Norwegian cup in 1961, which ended in October when Fredrikstad FK defeated them in the semifinal at Brann Stadion. The attendance for that game, 24,800 people, is to this day the record at Brann stadium. Jensen was in and out of the national team in 1961, but played seven games.
In the 1961–62 season, Jensen helped Brann win their first ever League Championship. In the book &quot;Godfoten&quot;, Nils Arne Eggen describes a situation where Jensen and Rolf Birger Pedersen, in the next-to-last game of the season against Rosenborg, took off their football shoes and humiliated their opponents by playing in their socks in a demonstration of superiority. However, the fact is disputed, and Pedersen denied that it ever happened. Brann won the game 4–1, with Jensen scoring one goal. Following that season, Jensen was named &quot;striker of the year&quot; by the newspaper &quot;Verdens Gang&quot;, and &quot;player of the year&quot; in &quot;Sportsboken&quot;, a sports yearbook published in Norway.
Brann repeated their success and won the Norwegian First Division in 1963.

===Hearts (1965–1970)===

Jensen transferred to Hearts after the 1964 season, while SK Brann was relegated, and debuted as the Jambo&#x27;s first overseas international on 2 January 1965. He stayed with Hearts until 1971. His Hearts career was plagued by injuries, but he still played 170 games and scored 31 goals. An important goal was the extra-time winner against Morton in the 1968 Scottish Cup semifinal; however, the Jam Tarts lost the resultant final 1–3 to Dunfermline Athletic.

===Back in Brann (1971–1973)===
Jensen returned to Brann in the summer of 1971. He played the final nine games in the league that season, scoring two goals. Despite Jensen&#x27;s return, Brann ended ninth—second from the bottom in the league. Usually this would mean relegation, but the league was expanded to 12 teams in 1972, and only one team was relegated.

Controversy started in the pre-season during 1972, when Jensen ended up in a fight with the referee during an indoor tournament in Haukelandshallen. Jensen was suspended for six months, unable to play half the season. Jensen returned after the summer break, and Brann ended up in the cup final, beating Rosenborg 1–0, 47 years after Brann&#x27;s last cup triumph. Despite his long suspension, Jensen was named &quot;footballer of the year&quot; in Norway after playing a total of ten games and scoring three goals in league and cup.

Jensen played regularly through the 1973 season, and at age 30, he was expected to play for many years to come. After a quarrel on the pitch, manager Ray Freeman took away Jensen&#x27;s status as team captain. However, the club&#x27;s board insisted that Jensen was to remain captain. When Jensen also ended up in conflict with new manager Billy Elliott, he and his brother Kjell chose to retire. His last game as a Brann player was in the European Cup Winners Cup, against Glentoran F.C., on 7 November 1973.

In total, Jensen played 244 games for Brann, and is regarded as the club&#x27;s greatest player ever.

===National team===
Jensen made his international debut for Norway in a friendly against Austria on 22 June 1960, aged just 17 years and 161 days, which makes him the third-youngest player to have appeared for Norway&#x27;s senior national team. Although the selection committee was skeptical of him, due to his young age, Jensen earned excellent reviews for his performance against Austria, and kept his place in the team. Jensen scored his first international goal, becoming the Norway team&#x27;s youngest-ever goalscorer, in his second game, against Finland on 28 August 1960 – a game Norway won 6–3. However, his breakthrough for Norway was in a game against Sweden on 18 September 1960, where Jensen and his Brann teammate Rolf Birger Pedersen, charmed the entire country with their magnificent football and shy appearance. Norway won the game 3–1.

Jensen remained a regular in the Norway side throughout the early 1960s, and on 7 November 1963, following a game against Scotland, he became the youngest-ever player to receive the Gold Watch for having played 25 senior international games. However, due to the Norwegian FA&#x27;s self-imposed &quot;amateur rule&quot;, Jensen became ineligible for the national team when he joined Hearts in 1964, and did not play for his country again until 1969, when the amateur rule was lifted. In total, Jensen played 31 international games for Norway, and scored five goals, earning his 31st and final cap in a match against Hungary on 27 October 1971.

==Outside football==
Roald Jensen married Eva Sofie Jetmundsen on 15 July 1967. Before his comeback for Brann in 1971, Jensen worked for Fiskernes Bank in Bergen. After he retired from football, he continued to work in Bergen&#x27;s banking and insurance sector.

Jensen played for Brann&#x27;s various old-boys&#x27; teams. He died of heart failure on 6 October 1987, while on the football field training with Brann&#x27;s old-boys&#x27; team &quot;Gamlekara&quot;. Thousands attended his funeral in Fyllingsdalen&#x27;s church. In 1990 and 1991, Jensen&#x27;s son Sondre Jensen made five appearances for SK Brann. He is the father-in-law of the Norwegian football manager and former player Roy Wassberg, and the grandfatherfather of the current player Niklas Jensen Wassberg.

A bronze statue of Kniksen made by the Norwegian sculptor Per Ung was installed outside Brann Stadion in 1995. In 2008, a large area outside the two new stands at Brann Stadion was named &quot;Kniksens plass&quot; after Roald Jensen. This also became SK Brann&#x27;s new address.

==The Kniksen award==

In Roald Jensen&#x27;s honour, the Kniksen award is given to Norwegian football players after each football season. The award is handed out by Norsk Toppfotball, and has been awarded annually since 1990. There are separate awards for best goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, striker, manager, and referee. It is recognized as Norwegian football&#x27;s most prestigious award.

<doc id="799416" wikidata="Q17111307" url="?curid=799416" title="Ching chong">
<text>Ching chong, ching chang chong, and chung ching are ethnic slurs used to mock or imitate the Chinese language, people of Chinese ancestry, or other people of East Asian descent perceived to be Chinese. The term is a derogatory imitation of Mandarin and Cantonese phonology. The phrases have sometimes accompanied assaults or physical intimidation of East Asians, as have other racial slurs or imitation of Chinese.

==Historical usage==

While usually intended for ethnic Chinese, the slur has also been directed at other East Asians. Mary Paik Lee, a Korean immigrant who arrived with her family in San Francisco in 1906, wrote in her 1990 autobiography &quot;Quiet Odyssey&quot; that on her first day of school, girls circled and hit her, chanting:
Ching Chong, Chinaman, 
Sitting on a wall. 
Along came a white man, 
And chopped his head off.
A variation of this rhyme is repeated by a young boy in John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;Cannery Row&quot; in mockery of a Chinese man. In this version, &quot;wall&quot; is replaced with &quot;rail&quot;, and the phrase &quot;chopped his head off&quot; is changed to &quot;chopped off his tail&quot;:
Ching Chong, Chinaman, 
Sitting on a rail. 
Along came a white man, 
And chopped off his tail. 
In 1917, a ragtime piano song entitled &quot;Ching Chong&quot; was co-written by Lee S. Roberts and J. Will Callahan. Its lyrics contained the following words:
&quot;Ching, Chong, Oh Mister Ching Chong,
You are the king of Chinatown.
Ching Chong, I love your sing-song,
When you have turned the lights all down.&quot;
==Modern incidents==
In December 2002, NBA star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal received media flak for saying &quot;Tell [NBA center] Yao Ming, &#x27;Ching chong yang, wah, ah soh&#x27;&quot; during an interview on Fox Sports Net. O&#x27;Neal later said it was locker-room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O&#x27;Neal was joking but said a lot of Asians would not see the humor. Yao joked, &quot;Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.&quot; O&#x27;Neal added, &quot;I mean, if I was the first one to do it, and the only one to do it, I could see what they&#x27;re talking about. But if I offended anybody, I apologize.&quot;

On January 24, 2006, comedian Dave Dameshek created an audio parody of the Asian Excellence Awards for &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot;. The premise of the parody was using the words &quot;ching&quot; and &quot;chong&quot; to mimic the awards show. Branding the segment as demeaning and racist, several Asian American organizations threatened to ask advertisers to withdraw their support from the show if the station did not issue an apology. On February 22, 2006, Carolla read a brief apology for the segment. On April 26, 2006, Carolla had the head of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, Guy Aoki on his show. Aoki opined that &quot;ching chong&quot; is equivalent to &quot;nigger&quot;.

On December 5, 2006, comedian and co-host Rosie O&#x27;Donnell of &quot;The View&quot; used a series of &quot;ching chongs&quot; to imitate newscasters in China. O&#x27;Donnell made a comment in reference to people in China talking about Danny DeVito&#x27;s drunken appearance on the show, &quot;You know, you can imagine in China it&#x27;s like, &#x27;Ching-gong-hu-gong, ching-chang-kong. Ching-chong. Danny DeVito. Ching-chong-chong-chong-chong. Drunk. The View. Ching-chong.&#x27;&quot; The Asian American Journalists Association said her comments were &quot;a mockery of the Chinese language and, in effect, a perpetuation of stereotypes of Asian Americans as foreigners or second-class citizens ... and gives the impression that they are a group that is substandard to English-speaking people&quot;. Cindi Berger, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s representative, said: &quot;She&#x27;s a comedian in addition to being a talk show co-host. I certainly hope that one day they will be able to grasp her humor.&quot; On December 14 on &quot;The View&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell said she was unaware that &quot;ching chong&quot; was an offensive way to make fun of Asian accents, and she was informed it was on par with the &quot;N-word&quot;. She apologized to &quot;those people who felt hurt&quot;. Jeff Yang, who tracks Asian and Asian-American trends for a market research firm, said O&#x27;Donnell shouldn&#x27;t have apologized for people&#x27;s hurt feelings. &quot;She should have apologized for spreading and encouraging ignorance.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell warned, &quot;there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;ll do something like that again, probably in the next week, not on purpose. Only &#x27;cause it&#x27;s how my brain works.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; called it a &quot;pseudo-apology&quot;. O&#x27;Donnell later wrote in her autobiography &quot;Celebrity Detox: The Fame Game&quot; that &quot;I wish I had been a bit more pure in my public apology.&quot;

On January 19, 2011, conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh mocked Chinese president Hu Jintao during his visit to the White House on his radio show. &quot;Hu Jintao—He was speaking and they weren&#x27;t translating. They normally translate every couple of words. Hu Jintao was just going ching chong, ching chong cha,&quot; said Limbaugh, who imitated Hu&#x27;s speech for 17 seconds. Representative Judy Chu of California said that Limbaugh&#x27;s words were the same ones that Chinese Americans have heard in the past 150 years as they faced racial discrimination while &quot;they were called racial slurs, were spat upon in the streets, derided in the halls of Congress and even brutally murdered&quot;. New York Assemblywoman Grace Meng said it was Limbaugh&#x27;s prerogative to attack Hu, &quot;but at the same time he offended 13% of New York City&#x27;s population&quot;. California State Senator Leland Yee also criticized Limbaugh for his remarks: &quot;His classless act is an insult to over 3,000 years of cultural history, and is a slap in the face to the millions of Chinese Americans who have struggled in this country and to a people who constitute one-quarter of the world&#x27;s population.&quot; Yee demanded an apology from Limbaugh for what he and others view as racist and derogatory remarks. He also organized with civil rights groups—including Chinese for Affirmative Action, Japanese American Citizens League and the California National Organization for Women—to boycott companies like ProFlowers, Sleep Train and Domino&#x27;s Pizza that advertised on Limbaugh&#x27;s talk show. Yee received threatening messages and also received a fax from an unknown sender which made racist comments and called him a Marxist. &quot;Rush Limbaugh will kick your Chink ass and expose you for the fool you are,&quot; part of the memo said.
In March 2011, UCLA student Alexandra Wallace uploaded a YouTube video entitled &quot;UCLA Asians in the library&quot;, ranting about the &quot;hordes of Asians&quot; in UCLA who don&#x27;t &quot;use American manners&quot;. In a rant about Asians speaking loudly on a cellphone in the campus library, she mimicked one as saying, &quot;Ohhh! Ching chong, ling long, ting tong! Ohhh!&quot;. Her rant inspired heated criticism, not only because of her use of the &quot;ching chong&quot; stereotype but also because of the timing: a major tsunami had just occurred in Japan, leading her to complain, &quot;I swear they&#x27;re going through their whole families, just checking on everybody from the tsunami thing.&quot; Over 40 percent of the school&#x27;s 36,000 students are Asian American and Pacific Islanders. Musician Jimmy Wong uploaded the video, &quot;Ching Chong!: Asians in the Library Song&quot; to YouTube, in response. The video received national coverage. &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; wrote, &quot;The students [she] mocked can inspire resentment, jealousy and fear—the kindling of ethnic slurs—because their success is about achievement and a pathway to status.&quot; Additional responses included a line of T-shirts featuring the &quot;Ching-chong&quot; slur, with all proceeds going to Red Cross relief for the tsunami. UCLA deemed the video offensive and called it &quot;repugnant&quot;. The student later wrote to &quot;The Daily Bruin&quot;, issuing an apology to &quot;the entire UCLA campus&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an editorial criticizing the video, but supporting her First Amendment right to free speech. Several days later, UCLA announced it would not discipline the student, but she withdrew from the university. &quot;AsianWeek&quot; wrote that &quot;any negatives [the student] experienced are just a fraction of what Asian Americans have experienced since coming to America&quot;.

A &quot;Colbert Report&quot; tweet, in March 2014, brought the slur back into the limelight. The program was lampooning the controversy surrounding the name of the Washington Redskins football team. The team&#x27;s owner, Daniel Snyder, had announced that he was dedicating a charity for Native Americans called &quot;Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation&quot;. In the March 26, 2014 episode of the &quot;Report&quot;, Colbert satirized a charity to Native Americans using the offensive word &quot;Redskins&quot; in its name, and stated that he would be starting his own similar charity called &quot;Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever&quot;, adding &quot;I owe all this sensitivity to Redskins owner Dan Snyder. So Asians, send your thank-you letters to him, not me.&quot; The following day, a Twitter account for the program run by Comedy Central tweeted, &quot;I am willing to show #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever&quot; but did not link to the episode or provide context for the statement. This quickly led to people creating a #CancelColbert hashtag, which lasted until the following Monday&#x27;s episode (March 31, 2014) when Colbert described the sequence of events, scolded Comedy Central for the poorly contextualized tweet, and criticized the offense-takers&#x27; haste in their CancelColbert campaign, also noting that Dan Snyder&#x27;s charity named after Redskins was ironically not being protested.

During the 2014 &quot;League of Legends&quot; World Championship group stage in Taiwan, Team SoloMid jungler Svenskeren registered an account by the name TaipeiChingChong on the Garena servers and was subsequently fined and suspended by Riot Games. The incident was also criticized by the Taiwanese version of the newspaper &quot;Apple Daily&quot;.

In 2015, the president of Argentina used a similar phrase to imitate Mandarin phonology while referencing a trade deal.

In August 2018, voters reported that Michigan state representative Bettie Cook Scott urged her supporters, &quot;don&#x27;t vote for the ching-chong&quot; in the primary election, referring to her opponent, Stephanie Chang. She later issued an apology through a representative. She would lose the election and &quot;de facto&quot; defaulted her seat after the apology until Chang&#x27;s inauguration to a Michigan House office charged with representing the district&#x27;s affairs in the interim period in her place.

In November 2018, Filipino &quot;Dota 2&quot; player Carlo &quot;Kuku&quot; Palad was banned from attending the Chongqing Major after typing &quot;ching chong&quot; during a live match against Chinese players. He eventually apologized, but did not get his ban lifted. This followed an earlier event when another Filipino player Andrei &quot;Skemberlu&quot; Ong used the same term during a match with a Chinese team a few weeks earlier.

In December 2018, American rapper Lil Pump was criticized after using the term in a teaser for his then-upcoming single &quot;Butterfly Doors&quot;, which also contained the lyric &quot;They call me Yao Ming &#x27;cuz my eyes real low&quot; with him slanting his eyes. He later was chided by several Asian and Asian-American rappers such as China Mac and Awkwafina. Lil Pump subsequently released an apology and edited out the lyrics from the official music video.

In November 2022, German former professional footballer Jimmy Hartwig was criticized after using the term in his commentary about the Japan national football team on WELT-TV for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The WELT management company removed the video from YouTube and Hartwig posted an apology on his Instagram.

In 2025, Queenstown, New Zealand hamburger bar Fergburger apologised for identifying a customer on a shop receipt with stereotypical label &quot;ching chang&quot;. The employee responsible was later sacked.

<text>Westmead is a suburb in Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Westmead is located 26 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government areas of City of Parramatta and Cumberland Council and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.

==Geography==

Westmead is bounded by the Parramatta River, Toongabbie Creek and Finlayson Creek in the north. On the east it is bounded by Parramatta Park, the Parramatta Golf Club, Amos Street and Good Street. The southern boundary is the Great Western Highway. The western boundary is Bridge Road, the railway line and Finlayson Creek.

== History ==
The Dharug people are the traditional custodians of the land in the area now known as Westmead.

Captain Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for Britain in 1770. The first fleet arrived at Sydney Harbour on 26 January 1788 and a colony was declared on 7 February 1788. An exploration party was led by Governor Arthur Phillip in April 1788 travelling along Parramatta River, deciding on Parramatta as the next town. An outpost was established by November 1788 in Parramatta, which later spread to the nearby area of what is known today as Westmead.

With the British settlement of Parramatta, Westmead was originally part of the domain of Government House. What is left of this domain, including Government House, form Parramatta Park. The name Westmead came into use when the governor&#x27;s domain was first subdivided in 1859. The subdivision of the domain was completed in 1889. The Northern Meadow and Western Meadow of the domain were split off and called Northmead and Westmead. From this time orchards were established by many new settlers, including some whose names were well known in the Parramatta area – George Oakes, Nat Payten and William Fullagar among them.

Parramatta Marist School was established by Fr. John Therry in Hunter Street Parramatta in 1820, under the direction of Mr. George Morley. The school was transferred to the site of the present junior school in 1837 and entrusted to the care of the Marist Brothers in 1875. This makes Parramatta Marist the oldest Catholic school in Australia.

Westmead railway platform is clearly shown on this map of the “Parish of St John” County of Cumberland in 1902. All of the area from Wentworthville East towards Parramatta is included on the map as part of this shire. This region includes parts of land in the District of Parramatta, Blacktown &amp; Baulkham Hills Shires and forms the major part of the Cumberland LGA. The Wentworthville East and Darcyville estates are not included in this area, most of these estate parts belonging what is now Parramatta LGA.

By 1919 the present site was acquired, and the first purpose-built school building was opened in May 1920. In 1923 the building was extended to provide accommodation for Primary students. Within two years the growing local population created demand for additional accommodation for Primary students. At the present day Westmead Public School is one of the best primary schools in NSW, with high academic, sporting and art achievements. It schools over 900 children and has many professional teachers and staff.

The railway station also operates as the terminus station for the L4 Westmead &amp; Carlingford line of the Sydney Light Rail network, which opened in 20 December 2024. Future Parramatta Light Rail services will operate to Sydney Olympic Park, and future Sydney Metro West services will serve Westmead as the terminus.

The Western railway line from Parramatta to Blacktown was built through the suburb in 1861. A railway station at Westmead was opened in April 1893 after a successful petition by local residents.

<text>St Bartholomew the Less is an Anglican church in the City of London, associated with St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, within whose precincts it stands. Once a parish church, it has, since 1 June 2015, been a chapel of ease in the parish of St Bartholomew the Great.

==History==
The present establishment is the latest in a series of churches and chapels associated with the hospital over the past 800 years. Its earliest predecessor, known as the Chapel of the Holy Cross, was founded nearby in 1123 (at the same time as the priory, now the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great) before moving to the present site in 1184. 

Along with most other religious foundations the hospital was dissolved by Henry VIII. It was then refounded by King Henry VIII, when the chapel became an Anglican parish church serving those living within its precincts. Its suffix, &quot;the less&quot;, was given to distinguish it from its larger neighbour, St Bartholomew the Great (the former priory).

The church&#x27;s tower and west façade date from the 15th century, with two of its three bells dating from 1380 and 1420. They hang within an original medieval bell frame, believed to be the oldest in the City of London. In 1793, George Dance the Younger, a Royal Academician, created a new octagonal interior within the shell of the medieval chapel, its clerestorey rising above the old walls. The new construction was made entirely of wood and soon became affected by dry-rot. In 1823 it was replaced under the supervision of Thomas Hardwick, who replicated the timber construction in stone with an iron ceiling. He also made alterations to the detailing.

The church suffered some bomb damage during the Blitz of the Second World War but this was repaired and the church reopened by 1951.

St Bartholomew the Less Church&#x27;s interior although small is light and airy, largely due to George Dance&#x27;s use of high lunette windows. Its form is that of an octagonal Gothic vault fitted into a square by the means of adding open triangular chapels at its corners.

The church was designated a Grade II* listed building on 4 January 1950 and is associated with the Haberdashers&#x27; Company, its close neighbour in West Smithfield at Haberdashers&#x27; Hall, EC1.

After a few years in which the Rector of the nearby St Bartholomew the Great was simultaneously Priest-in-Charge of St Bartholomew the Less, with the church retaining its own PCC and Churchwardens, on 1 June 2015, the parishes of both churches were dissolved and replaced with the united benefice of Great St Bartholomew. The Rector of the former parish of St Bartholomew the Great became Rector of the united benefice. The boundary of the new parish incorporates precisely both former parishes. There is now a single PCC and Churchwardens responsible for both buildings. The parish church is St Bartholomew the Great, while St Bartholomew the Less is a Chapel of Ease within the parish. Services continue to be held at the church, especially a 12:30 Anglican Eucharist on Tuesdays, a 12:30 Roman Catholic Mass at 12:30 on Thursdays, and a 10:00 Anglican Family Eucharist on most Sundays of the year.

<doc id="799432" wikidata="Q2234880" url="?curid=799432" title="Beartooth Highway">
<text>The Beartooth Highway is an All-American Road in the western United States on a section of U.S. Route 212 in Montana and Wyoming between Red Lodge and the Northeast entrance of Yellowstone National Park. It crests at Beartooth Pass in Wyoming at above sea level, and was called &quot;the most beautiful drive in America,&quot; by late CBS News correspondent Charles Kuralt. Because of heavy snowfall at the top, the pass is usually open for about five months per year, from mid-May to mid-October, weather conditions permitting.

==Route description==
The Beartooth Highway is the section of U.S. Route 212 between Red Lodge and Cooke City, Montana. It traces a series of steep zigzags and switchbacks, along the Montana–Wyoming border (45th parallel) to the Beartooth Pass in Wyoming. The approximate elevation rise is from to in in the most daring landscapes.

When driving east to west, the highest parts of the Beartooth Highway level off into a wide plateau near the top of the pass, then descend to the junction with Wyoming Highway 296 (Chief Joseph Scenic Byway) near Cooke City, the northeast gateway to Yellowstone National Park. On the way one passes numerous lakes typical of the Absaroka–Beartooth Wilderness which borders the highway along much of its route.

The highway officially opened June 14, 1936.

At this elevation and latitude, snowstorms can occur even in the middle of the summer, and the pass is also known for strong winds and severe thunderstorms. Drivers should plan on a driving time of at least two hours for the trip from Red Lodge to Cooke City, and it is advised to check with the Red Lodge Chamber of Commerce or the Beartooth Ranger District beforehand in case of road closures. Montana Traveler Information and Wyoming Travel Information Service both provide online information on Beartooth Highway travel conditions for their respective portions of the highway. Altitude sickness is also a risk for susceptible individuals going to this altitude with such a rapid increase in elevation.

The Beartooth Highway passes through portions of Custer, Shoshone, and Gallatin national forests, and near the Absaroka–Beartooth Wilderness.

Despite this, and the U.S. highway number, and also connecting to state highway 296, it is not maintained by the Wyoming Department of Transportation or even the U.S. Forest Service, with WYDOT stating it does not meet standards for Wyoming state highways. It is instead maintained by the National Park Service, despite not being part of the park (like the Foothills Parkway or Skyline Drive) or being its own unit (like the Blue Ridge Parkway and Natchez Trace Parkway). The Montana Department of Transportation does maintain its portions in Custer and Gallatin national forests at the east and west ends of the highway, respectively. 

Neither MDT nor NPS perform snow removal except for once in the spring, typically in May, but sometimes not until June if there has been heavy snowfall. Once the road opens, Beartooth Basin Ski Area opens near the state line at Beartooth Pass, for a short summer-only season that lasts until July.

==History==

In August 1872, the pass was crossed by Civil War General Philip Sheridan and 120 men returning from an inspection tour of Yellowstone National Park. Rather than take the long detour down the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River to return to Billings, Sheridan took the advice of an old hunter named Shuki Greer, who claimed intimate knowledge of the Beartooth Mountains. When the road was opened in 1936, it essentially followed Sheridan&#x27;s route over the pass.

===2005 closure===
During the spring of 2005, several large mudslides and rockslides on May 19–20 damaged or destroyed the Montana side of the Beartooth Highway in a dozen places between mile markers 39 and 51. The road was closed for reconstruction, and a $20.4 million construction contract issued which stipulated an October 2005 completion date. Construction was completed ahead of schedule; however, the highway did not reopen for a year.
An estimated of rock was removed from a section of the highway near the top of the switchbacks, and construction crews drilled down to solid bedrock to create new supports for the road.

<text>The Guild Church of St Katharine Cree is an Anglican church in the Aldgate ward of the City of London, on the north side of Leadenhall Street near Leadenhall Market. It was founded in 1280. The present building dates from 1628 to 1630. Formerly a parish church, it is now a guild church.

==History==
===Former building===
The parish served by the church existed by 1108, when it was served by the Augustinian Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate, also called Christ Church, which was founded by Maud, queen at the time of King Henry I. The parishioners used the priory church but this proved unsatisfactory and disruptive to the priory&#x27;s activities.

The prior partly resolved the problem in 1280 by founding St Katharine Cree as a separate church for the parishioners. The site of the present church was originally in the priory&#x27;s churchyard and it is possible that the church began as a cemetery chapel. It took its name from the priory, &quot;Cree&quot; being abstracted from forms like &quot;Crichurch&quot;, which were abbreviations of &quot;Christ Church&quot; (H.A. Harben, &quot;A Dictionary of London&quot; (1918)). It was initially served by a canon appointed by the prior but this did not prove satisfactory either, so, in 1414, the church was established as a parish church in its own right. The present tower was added about 1504.

Describing the building at the end of the 16th century, John Stow wrote:
===Current building===

The present church was built in 1628–30, retaining the Tudor tower of its predecessor. It is larger than the previous church, incorporating a piece of ground previously occupied by a cloister on the north side, and the floor level is considerably higher. The rebuilt church was consecrated by William Laud, Bishop of London on 31 January 1631. His vestments and the form of service that he used for the consecration were later held against him in his trial and conviction for heresy, when Puritans accused him of having displayed Catholic sympathies through his &quot;bowings and cringings&quot;. He is commemorated by a chapel in the church.

The church escaped the Great Fire of London in 1666 and suffered only minor damage in the London Blitz of the Second World War. However, structural problems required extensive restoration in 1962. It is now one of the city&#x27;s Guild churches.

St Katharine Cree is a significant church of the Jacobean period, a time when few new churches were built. It is the only Jacobean church to have survived in London. The identity of its architect is unknown. It has a high nave, linked with the narrow aisles by arcades supported on Corinthian columns. The church is long and wide; the height to the ceiling of the nave is .

The chancel has a rose window, reputedly modelled on the much larger one in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (destroyed in the Great Fire). The window and its stained glass are original, dating from 1630. The baptismal font dates from around 1640. The vaulted ceiling bears bosses of the arms of 16 of the city&#x27;s livery companies and of the City of London itself. From the east end the bosses are:

*North Aisle – Mercers, Drapers, Skinners, Salters, Dyers and Pewterers 

*Nave – The City of London, Fishmongers, Merchant Taylors, Ironmongers, Clothworkers and Leathersellers

*South Aisle – Grocers, Goldsmiths, Haberdashers, Vinters and Brewers

The present scheme dates mostly from the restoration of 1972. Tradition says that these Companies used St Katharine Cree for a time after the Great Fire of London of 1666, while their own Guild Churches were being rebuilt. 

The church is a Grade I listed building.

By the south wall of St Katharine&#x27;s is a memorial to RMS &quot;Lancastria&quot;, a troopship sunk at sea with huge loss of life during the Second World War in 1940. It includes a model of the ship and the ship&#x27;s bell.

St Katharine&#x27;s has a ring of six bells. Lester and Pack of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast five of them including the treble bell in 1754. Thomas II Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor bell in 1842. The church clock has a bell, also cast by Lester and Pack in 1754. In the summer of 2007 they were rung for the first time since 1880. An appeal to raise £60,000 to restore the bells to full ringing order was launched in November 2007, and the project was completed in 2009. It is the only tower in the City where the bells are rung from a ground-floor ringing chamber.

Today St Katharine&#x27;s is a guild church and has no parish, but chose some years ago to dedicate its ministry to the worlds of finance, commerce and industry.

==Notable people associated with the church==

* Stephen Charnock (1628–80), Puritan Presbyterian clergyman and theologian, was born in the parish.
* Hans Holbein the Younger&#x27;s grave (died 1543) has been claimed by both St Andrew Undershaft church and by St Katharine Cree. St Katharine Cree&#x27;s claim is stronger because the nearby abbey had been recently destroyed, while St Andrew Undershaft&#x27;s graveyard was already full.
* Both Henry Purcell and George Frideric Handel played the organ at the church.
* Sir Nicholas Throckmorton (died 1571), diplomat and ambassador, is buried in the church.

<doc id="799436" wikidata="Q107293" url="?curid=799436" title="Pitchfork">
<text>A pitchfork or hay fork is an agricultural tool used to pitch loose material, such as hay, straw, manure, or leaves. It has a long handle and usually two to five thin tines designed to efficiently move such materials.

The term is also applied colloquially, but inaccurately, to the garden fork. While similar in appearance, the garden fork is shorter and stockier than the pitchfork, with three or four thicker tines intended for turning or loosening the soil of gardens.

==Alternative terms==
In some parts of England, a pitchfork is known as a &quot;prong&quot;. In parts of Ireland, the term &quot;sprong&quot; is used to refer specifically to a four-pronged pitchfork.

==Description==
The typical pitchfork consists of a wooden shaft bearing two to five slightly curved metal tines fixed to one end of a handle. These are typically made of steel, wrought iron, or some other alloy, though historically wood or bamboo were used. Unlike a garden fork, a pitchfork lacks a grab at the end of its handle.

Pitchforks with few tines set far apart are typically used for bulky material such as hay or straw; those with more and more closely spaced are used for looser materials such as silage, manure, leaves, or compost.

==History==
In Europe, the pitchfork was first used in the Early Middle Ages, at about the same time as the harrow. These were made entirely of wood.

The pitchfork is occasionally employed as an improvised weapon, as in a mob or riot.

==In popular culture==
===Artwork===
Paintings by various artists depict a wide variety of pitchforks in use and at rest. A notable American work is &quot;American Gothic&quot; (1930) by Grant Wood, which features a three-pronged tool.

===Politics===
Because of its association with peasantry and farming, the pitchfork has been used as a populist symbol and appended as a nickname for certain leading populist figures, such as &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Ben Tillman and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Pat Buchanan.

The Gangster Disciples, a street gang in the Midwestern United States, use a three-pointed pitchfork as one of their symbols.

Venezuelan far-right political party, New Order use three-pointed pitchforks as their symbol.

===Religious symbolism===
The pitchfork is often used in lieu of the visually similar weapon, the trident, in popular portrayals and satire of Christian demonology. Many humorous cartoons, both animated and otherwise, feature a caricature of a demon ostensibly wielding a &quot;pitchfork&quot; (often actually a trident) sitting on one shoulder of a protagonist, opposite an angel on the other.

The Hellenistic deity Hades wields a bident, a two-pronged weapon similar in form to a pitchfork but actually related to the trident in design and purpose.

<doc id="799438" wikidata="Q7594608" url="?curid=799438" title="St Mary Woolnoth">
<text>St Mary Woolnoth is an Anglican church in the City of London, located on the corner of Lombard Street and King William Street near Bank junction. The present building is one of the Queen Anne Churches, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor. The parish church continues to be actively used for services, with Holy Communion every Tuesday. St Mary Woolnoth lies in the ward of Langbourn.

==History==
===Early history===

Roman remains were found under the site during the rebuilding by Hawksmoor, and there is speculation that there was a large Roman building in the immediate vicinity. This has led some to believe that the site has been used for worship for at least 2,000 years. This is based on the guess that the Roman remains were of a religious nature, and &#x27;under the remains of an Anglo-Saxon wooden structure&#x27;. However, its name is first recorded in 1191 as &quot;Wilnotmaricherche&quot;.

It is believed that the name &quot;Woolnoth&quot; refers to a benefactor, possibly one Wulnoth de Walebrok who is known to have lived in the area earlier in the 12th century, or perhaps Wulfnoth Cild, a South Saxon nobleman and grandfather of King Harold Godwinson. Its full (and unusual) dedication is to Saint Mary of the Nativity.

The present building is at least the third church on the site. The Norman church survived until 1445, when it was rebuilt, with a spire added in 1485. It was badly damaged in 1666 in the Great Fire of London but was repaired by Sir Christopher Wren. Two new bells (the treble and the tenor) were cast in 1670, and in 1672 the middle bell was cast. The patched-up structure proved unsafe, however, and had to be demolished in 1711.

The parish registers include records of the baptism of two men of African origin in the early 17th-century, Andrew Blackmore in 1629, and Timothy, described as a &quot;heathen blackamoore&quot; in 1629.

===Hawksmoor===

The church was rebuilt by the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches. Work began in 1716 and the new church was reopened for worship on Easter Day 1727. It was commissioned from Nicholas Hawksmoor, who had responded with one of his most distinctive and original designs. He benefited greatly from having an unusually open area in which to work. The old church had been hemmed in by shops and houses, like many other City churches, but these were demolished at the same time as the church. Hawksmoor was thus able to fully exploit the unobstructed front of the site. St Mary Woolnoth is Hawksmoor&#x27;s only City of London church.

The resultant church was something of an architectural statement on Hawksmoor&#x27;s part. Its unusually imposing façade, in English Baroque style, is dominated by two flat-topped turrets supported by columns of the Corinthian order, which are used throughout the church. The west side of the façade, facing Lombard Street, has distinctive recesses bearing an inset forward-curving pediment resting on skewed columns.

The interior of the church is surprisingly spacious, despite its relatively small size. The layout is typical Hawksmoor, forming a &quot;cube within a cube&quot; – a square enclosed by three rows of four columns which is itself enclosed by a wider square. It is dominated by a baroque baldaquin, modelled on that of Bernini in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

===Threatened demolition===

The church underwent major changes in the late 19th century and the turn of the 20th century; it was proposed for demolition on several occasions but was saved each time. Its galleries were removed by William Butterfield in 1876, who thought they were unsafe, and a number of other significant (and not entirely successful) changes were made at the same time.

Between 1897 and 1900 the City &amp; South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) built Bank Underground station beneath the church. The C&amp;SLR were given permission to demolish it, but public outcry forced them to reconsider: the company undertook to use only the subsoil instead. The crypt was sold to the railway and the bones were removed for reburial at Ilford. The walls and internal columns of the church were then supported on steel girders while the lift shafts and staircase shaft for Bank station were built directly beneath the church floor. At this time, the bells were also rehung with new fittings. No cracks formed in the plasterwork, and no settlement of the structure occurred; the company later claimed that the edifice of the church was considerably stronger than before.

==Mid-twentieth century==
St Mary Woolnoth was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950, and in 1952 became a guild church.

==Present day==
St Mary Woolnoth is the active parish church for the combined parish of &quot;St Edmund the King and Martyr, and St Mary Woolnoth Lombard Street with St Nicholas Acons, All Hallows Lombard Street, St Benet Gracechurch, St Leonard Eastcheap, St Dionis Backchurch and St Mary Woolchurch Haw&quot; – usually shortened to &quot;St Edmund &amp; St Mary Woolnoth&quot; (the only two aforementioned churches to have survived). It is part of the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese of London.

It is currently used by London&#x27;s German-speaking Swiss community, and is also the official church in London of the government of British Columbia, Canada.

The 2013 boundary changes to the City&#x27;s wards kept the church within Langbourn, despite the surrounding buildings being transferred to Candlewick and Walbrook wards, because of the church&#x27;s strong connections with the ward.

==Notable people associated with the church==

* T. S. Eliot refers to this church in a famous passage of his 1922 poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, Part 1, &#x27;The Burial of the Dead&#x27;:

A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had undone so many.
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying, &quot;Stetson!
You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!

In his notes to the poem Eliot remarks that the &quot;dead sound on the final stroke of nine&quot; was &quot;A phenomenon which I have often noticed.&quot;

St Mary Woolnoth is an important historical site in Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Hawksmoor&quot; where it is the scene of one of a series of murders all taking place at churches redesigned by Nicholas Hawksmoor, who is given the fictional name Nicholas Dyer.

<text>Engelberg Abbey () is a Benedictine monastery in Engelberg, Canton of Obwalden, Switzerland. It was formerly in the Diocese of Constance, but is now in the Diocese of Chur. It is dedicated to Our Lady of the Angels and occupies a commanding position at the head of the Nidwalden Valley.

==History==

The Engelberg abbey was founded on the 1 April 1120 by Count Conrad of Sellenbüren, and its first abbot was Adelhelm, a monk of Muri Abbey. The first inhabitants of Engelberg were also monks from the Muri abbey. Von Sellenbüren entered the Engelberg abbey as a monk and died on the 2 Mai 1126.
Pope Callistus II and the Emperor Henry IV both officially acknowledged the abbey in 1124. The abbey was placed under the immediate jurisdiction of the Holy See, who put it under protection by Saint Peter. In November 1224 Emperor Henry VI then also officially put the abbey under his protection. In the founding documents, the new abbey was known as &quot;Mons Angelorum&quot; and &quot;Engilberc&quot;.
Adelhelm, abbot until 1126, was followed by three disputed abbots which divided the community. They were followed by three abbots from St. Blaise&#x27;s Abbey in the Black Forest, Frowin (1143/47-1178), Berchtold (1178-1197) and Henry (1197-1223). Under Frowin a scriptorium was founded. Around 1200 the &quot;Engelberger Meister&quot; wrote and illustrated several books from the scriptorium. Since Frowin, the abbey was a so-called double monastery, in which both nuns and monks lived. The nuns established the in Sarnen in 1615.

In spiritual matters the abbots of Engelberg exercised quasi-episcopal jurisdiction over all their vassals and dependents, including the town which sprang up around the walls of the abbey, and also enjoyed the right of collation to all the parishes of the Canton.

In temporal matters they had supreme and absolute authority over a large territory, embracing one hundred and fifteen towns and villages, which were incorporated under the abbatial rule by a Bull of Pope Gregory IX in 1236. These and other rights they enjoyed until the French Revolution, in 1798, when most of them were taken away. Its population diminished several times by the plague in the years 1349, 1548 and 1565. In 1565, only one priest who was on service in Küssnacht survived of the community.

The prominent position in Switzerland which the abbey occupied for so many centuries was seriously threatened by the religious and political disturbances of the Reformation period, especially by the rapid spread of the teachings of Zwingli, and for a time its privileges suffered some curtailment.

In 1602 Engelberg joined with other houses to form the Swiss Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation.

The troubles and vicissitudes, however, through which it passed, were happily brought to an end by the wise rule of Abbot Benedict Sigrist in the 17th century, who is justly called the restorer of his monastery. Alienated possessions and rights were recovered by him and the good work he began was continued by his successors, under whom monastic discipline and learning have flourished with renewed vigour. The library, which is said to have contained over twenty thousand volumes and two hundred choice manuscripts, was pillaged by the French in 1798. Ironically, in the spirit of learning and preservation of knowledge, the library contains to this day a complete set of the writings of Martin Luther. The abbey buildings were almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1729 but were rebuilt in a substantial style and so remain to the present day.

In 1873 a colony from Engelberg founded Conception Abbey, at Conception, Missouri in the United States; in 1882, Mount Angel Abbey was founded near what is now Mount Angel, Oregon, also in the United States.

William Wordsworth wrote a poem about the abbey entitled &quot;Engelberg, The Hill of Angels&quot;.

== Educational institutions of the monastery ==
Since 1851, there exists the Boarding School of the Abbey Engelberg, which was first performed by a secular rector since 2009. 2001, the Academia Engelberg Foundation was founded.

<doc id="799456" wikidata="Q8015776" url="?curid=799456" title="William Moore (loyalist)">
<text>William Moore (1949 – 17 May 2009) was a Northern Irish loyalist. He was a member of the Shankill Butchers, an Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) gang. It was Moore who provided the black taxi and butcher knives which the gang used to carry out its killings. Following ringleader Lenny Murphy&#x27;s arrest, Moore took over as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the gang and the killings continued.

==Shankill Butchers==
Moore was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland and brought up a Protestant in the staunchly Ulster loyalist Shankill Road. Moore, who had a few previous convictions for petty crime, worked as a meat packer at Woodvale Meats on the Shankill. When he quit his job, he took with him an assortment of butcher&#x27;s knives and a meat cleaver. He then became a taxi driver, having bought a black taxi which he drove around the Shankill area. In 1975, Moore met Lenny Murphy in the Brown Bear pub on the Shankill Road. Murphy, who was assembling the gang that become known as the Shankill Butchers, recruited Moore into the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Their first action, which did not involve the knife-wielding violence that was to become their hallmark, occurred on 2 October 1975 when Moore and Murphy, along with two unidentified UVF members, robbed a Catholic-owned off-licence. Despite having been ordered just to rob the off-licence, the gang killed four Catholic employees in the process, two women and two 18-year-olds. Moore and Murphy escaped and, although the other two members were arrested, they did not name Moore or Murphy as having been involved.

Beginning in November 1975, the gang started abducting and murdering Roman Catholics, apparently in retaliation for the killing of four British soldiers by the Provisional IRA that same month. Moore was ordered by Murphy to drive around Catholic areas of Belfast in his taxi with the other gang members looking for prospective victims. Murphy and the other Butchers would bundle victims into the back of the taxi, then beat and torture them, before Murphy would finally drag them out into an alley and cut their throats with the weapons supplied by Moore. Journalist Peter Taylor spoke to a UVF member who explained that the Shankill Butchers had opted to use knives rather than guns because had they been caught with the latter the prison sentence received would be much longer. 

The following year, on 13 March 1976, Murphy was arrested and subsequently convicted of a firearms offence, and to divert suspicion from himself he ordered the &quot;Butcher&quot; slayings to continue. They did so, with Moore now acting as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader. Moore personally slit the throat of a young Catholic student from ear-to-ear and kicked another man to death. He also encouraged the others to torture the victims before killing them. The gang also killed several rival loyalist paramilitaries as a result of petty feuds, in addition to planting a bomb in a Catholic neighbourhood during a Provisional IRA parade. The bomb killed a 10-year-old boy, and wounded over 100 people.

===Conviction and imprisonment===
In 1977, after a victim, Gerard McLaverty escaped alive, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) drove him around the Shankill Road area and he was able to identify two of his captors: Sam McAllister and Benjamin Edwards. The Shankill Butchers gang, including Moore, was subsequently rounded up by RUC Detective Inspector Jimmy Nesbitt from &quot;C&quot; Division and his team of CID detectives who were investigating the murders from Tennent Street RUC station. McLaverty had also told police that the car into which he had been abducted was a yellow Ford Cortina, a vehicle they knew from their surveillance that Moore drove. Moore and the rest of the members broke down and confessed to the killings, although they were too terrified to name Lenny Murphy as the ringleader. However, during one police interview, Moore sought to put the blame solely on Murphy. &quot;It was that bastard Murphy who led me into all this. My head&#x27;s away with it&quot;. After a lengthy period spent in jail on remand, Moore and the others stood trial in February 1979 at the Belfast Crown Court. Moore pleaded guilty to the most murders – a total of eleven – and was convicted of these, plus a further eight murders. On 20 February he was sentenced to life imprisonment inside the Maze Prison with the trial judge, Lord Justice O&#x27;Donnell, recommending that he and co-accused Robert Bates never be released. Judge O&#x27;Donnell addressed Moore with the following statements, &quot;You pleaded guilty to 11 murders carried out in a manner so cruel and revolting as to be beyond the comprehension of any normal human being. I am convinced that without you many of the murders would have not have been committed&quot;. When being led from the court, Moore waved and smiled at the spectators in the public gallery.

Journalist Martin Dillon, author of the book &quot;The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder&quot;, described Moore as having been &quot;the quiet man&quot; inside the Shankill Butchers gang. However, behind his unassuming manner lurked a &quot;cold, vicious bigot&quot;. Even after Moore&#x27;s arrest, his mother had personally thanked Inspector Jimmy Nesbitt for taking her son off the streets and putting him in jail. According to Dillon, Moore was content to take orders from Murphy and revelled in the attention and adulation which came his way from Murphy and the other gang members by having provided the taxi and knives used in the attacks.

Moore was released from the Maze in 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement after having served 19 years. It was alleged that Moore became involved in loyalist drug deals, including a visit to a notorious Edinburgh gang.

==Death==
Moore died in his home in the loyalist Mount Vernon area of north Belfast on 17 May 2009 as the result of a suspected heart attack; his dog was at his side. He was buried at Carnmoney Cemetery where Lenny Murphy also lies. Murphy had been gunned down by the IRA in November 1982 four months after his release from prison. Moore&#x27;s grave is not far from that of one of his victims, Stephen McCann, a student whose throat he had personally cut. A press photographer covering his funeral on 21 May 2009 was attacked and beaten by a group of men, and received hospital treatment.

At the time of his death, Moore was due to be questioned by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) over his role in the 1974 killing of a 52-year-old Catholic man, John Crawford of Andersonstown, who had been abducted then beaten and shot dead by a UVF gang in the vicinity of Milltown Cemetery.

<doc id="799458" wikidata="Q706985" url="?curid=799458" title="Cloud Gate Dance Theater">
<text>Cloud Gate Dance Theatre () is a modern dance group based in Taiwan. It was founded by choreographer Lin Hwai-min in 1973, and later he shared its management with his late protégé, choreographer Lo Man-fei. The troupe was inactive from October 1988 to September 1990. During this time, Lin spent time abroad in India and Indonesia, and studied at New York University. The genesis of Cloud Gate Dance Theatre was rooted in Lin Hwai-min&#x27;s youthful desire to profoundly impact society, mirroring the &quot;barefoot doctors&quot; of the Cultural Revolution who endeavored to improve healthcare in impoverished rural areas.

The minor planet 200025, discovered on 25 July 2007, was formally named 200025 Cloud Gate for Cloud Gate Dance Theater on 29 April 2010, becoming the first minor planet to be named for a Taiwanese performing arts group. Cloud Gates&#x27;s performances have covered a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from the enchanting narratives of classical literature and folk tales to the intricate depictions of Taiwanese history and the multifaceted observations of social phenomena. The company&#x27;s dedication to connecting with its audience is evident through its diverse venues, ranging from the prestigious National Theater in Taipei to more localized settings such as cultural centers, gymnasiums, and school auditoriums throughout various towns and counties across Taiwan. The theatre&#x27;s commitment to accessibility and community engagement is further highlighted by its annual outdoor performances, which draw crowds of up to 60,000 people on one occasion, underlining their art&#x27;s widespread appeal and cultural significance.

== Alumni and training ==
Cloud Gate Dance Theatre has not only been a platform for showcasing the rich tapestry of dance but has also served as a fertile ground for nurturing talent, with many of Taiwan&#x27;s most celebrated modern dancers, including Lin Hsiu-wei, Lo Man-fei, and Liu Shao-lu. These individuals have achieved personal success and contributed to the broader dance community by establishing their dance groups, extending the influence of Cloud Gate&#x27;s artistic vision. The dancers at Cloud Gate, primarily alumni of Taiwan&#x27;s prestigious dance programs, bring a diverse skill set to the company, trained in modern dance, ballet, Peking opera movements, Tai Chi, and meditation.

==Stylistic innovations==
Lin Hwai-min, the founder of Cloud Gate, is also an author of short stories. His skills as a storyteller often influences his choreography.

Established in the 1970th, Cloud Gate created an unbroken series of dances and dance directions. Under the leadership of Lin Hwai-min, the Cloud Gate Dance Theater held debut public performance at Zhongshan Hall (中山堂) in Taipei in 1972. The dance group is known for its blending of modern stylizations of Asian mythology, folklore, and ancient aesthetics. Dancers practice and perform using a diversity of movement disciplines and artistic approaches such as qigong, tai chi, meditation, martial arts, modern dance, ballet, and calligraphy.

Cloud Gate has produced a variety of dance productions that explore Taiwanese cultural experiences within the broader context of Chinese and Asian cultures. These productions include works such as:

* White Serpent Tale (Baishezhuan), an adaptation of the Chinese folktale &quot;Legend of the White Snake&quot;.
* Han Shih, a retelling of the legends of Jie Zhitui and the origin of the Tomb-Sweeping Festival.
* Crossing the Ocean (Du Hai), a dance rich with layered references to generations of Chinese who have crossed the Taiwan Straits to reach Taiwan.
* Liao Tianding, a portrayal of a legendary Taiwanese Robin Hood character who foiled oppressive officials during the period of the Japanese occupation of Taiwan.
* Wu Feng, a long-form piece with echoes of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, based on the Wu Feng Legend concerning an official from the Chinese Mainland who was involved in early efforts to pacify aborigines in Taiwan.

==Organization==
Known for its extensive international tours, Cloud Gate has performed in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America. The company also spends much of its time performing throughout Taiwan, and is generally acknowledged as the country&#x27;s premier dance organization. In recognition of its importance locally and internationally, on August 21, 2003, Taiwan&#x27;s government proclaimed the day &quot;Cloud Gate Day&quot; and named the street on which the company&#x27;s office lies &quot;Cloud Gate Lane.&quot; This was the first time in Taiwan&#x27;s history a day and place were named after a living artist or active artistic organization.

The organization operated two other branches aside from its main dance company. One, called &quot;Cloud Gate 2&quot;, toured communities and worked with and helped develop young dancers and choreographers. It was founded in 1999. The other, Cloud Gate Dance School was founded in 1998 with a view to making dance education more broadly available. After the death of Lo Man-fei, Lin Hwai-min ran Cloud Gate 2 until 2014, when took over. Cheng had been with the troupe as guest choreographer since 2006.

== Educational outreach ==
In a significant expansion of its educational outreach, Cloud Gate Dance Theatre established the &quot;Cloud Gate Dance Workshop&quot; in 1998, leveraging its accumulated professional expertise to develop the &quot;Living Rhythm&quot; teaching materials. These resources were designed to foster a deeper connection between students and the art of dance, encouraging them to explore their bodies and cultivate their unique rhythmic expressions through innovative and engaging teaching methodologies. This initiative was followed by introducing &quot;Cloud Gate 2&quot; in May 1999, a subsidiary ensemble aimed at broadening the theatre&#x27;s reach by performing in schools and communities across Taiwan. &quot;Cloud Gate 2&quot; not only serves to extend the theatre&#x27;s artistic reach but also provides a platform for young Taiwanese choreographers through its annual &quot;Spring Riot&quot; performance. The &quot;Artistic Campus&quot; program, initiated in 2000, has further demonstrated Cloud Gate&#x27;s commitment to education, impacting nearly 2,300 students.

== Community engagement and disaster relief ==
The theatre&#x27;s engagement with the community extends beyond the stage through initiatives such as the &quot;Artistic Residency in Counties&quot; project launched in 2007, which aims to embed the company within urban and rural communities to foster local arts development. Furthermore, Cloud Gate Dance Theatre&#x27;s involvement in fundraising tours for disaster relief efforts, from the 921 earthquake to the Typhoon Morakot floods, exemplifies its dedication to leveraging its artistic platform for societal benefit, aiding in the reconstruction of communities devastated by natural disasters.

==2008: a new era begins for Cloud Gate==

On 11 February 2008, a fire destroyed the Cloud Gate Dance Theater&#x27;s studio, costume, props and records dating to 1975 in the production archives. Donations to rebuild totaled NT$370 million (US$12 million) from 175 business groups and 3,973 individuals, while the government donated a former art and education site in Danshui. The Danshui facilities were inaugurated on 19 April 2015. It includes a 450-seat theater, a 1,500 person outdoor theater and two studios.

&quot;Whisper of Flowers,&quot; the first new production to be staged after the fire razed and demolished the dance company&#x27;s rehearsal studio in Bali, was a piece specifically created in celebration of Cloud Gate&#x27;s 35-year anniversary. The production was first premiered in Chiayi on September 12, 2008.

In 2011, Lin attempted to weave contemporary Taiwanese music and modern love songs into &quot;How Can I Live On Without You&quot;, to show that the troupe&#x27;s demographics had changed. Lin announced in November 2017 that he would retire by 2019. Cheng Tsung-lung was named Lin&#x27;s successor as leader of Cloud Gate. In February 2019, Cloud Gate Dance Theater received the Stef Stefanou Award for Outstanding Company at the National Dance Awards presented by The Critics&#x27; Circle of the United Kingdom.

==2020: Lin Hwai-min retires==
In 2017, Lin Hwai-min announced that he would retire in 2020. Lin and the troupe began performing classic works to mark his exit from Cloud Gate, as well as the retirement of the company&#x27;s senior dancers. Cloud Gate 2 merged with the main troupe on 31 July 2018. Lin&#x27;s final performance staged at the National Theater and Concert Hall, Taipei featured a collaboration with Chinese choreographer Tao Ye. Lin continued working with Tao and Cheng throughout 2019, ending his career with a performance at National Taichung Theater in October.

Cheng Tsung-lung succeeded Lin Hwai-min as Artistic Director of Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan in 2020.

== Associated products ==
The story of Lin Hwai-min and Cloud Gate has been chronicled in the book &quot;Soaring Dance: Lin Hwai-min and the Cloud Gate Legend,&quot; written by Meng-yu Yang and published by Commonwealth Publishing in 1998. The documentary &quot;Dance, Song - Cloud Gate 30,&quot; supervised by Chang Chao-tang, was produced and distributed by the Public Television Service Foundation. Several of Cloud Gate&#x27;s performances have been filmed and released as dance videos. &quot;Songs of the Wanderers&quot; was filmed in the Netherlands, &quot;Water Stains on the Wall&quot; in France, &quot;Bamboo Dream&quot; in Germany, and &quot;Cursive II&quot; in Switzerland. These films have been broadcast on multiple national television channels and released globally on DVD-Video. Additionally, a series of DVDs including &quot;Cloud Gate - The Legend,&quot; the &quot;Cursive Trilogy,&quot; &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber,&quot; &quot;Nine Songs,&quot; and &quot;Trace of Leak&quot; have been released by King Records.

<text>John Davies (10 June 1814 – 11 June 1872) co-founded the Australian newspaper &quot;The Mercury&quot;.

Davies was a Jew born in London, England. He was transported to Hobart, Australia as a convict in August 1831, for ordering candles on someone else&#x27;s account. His father had been transported to New South Wales only a few years before.

On 5 July 1854 he and Auber George Jones, a Tasmanian pastoralist, published the first edition of &quot;The Mercury&quot;.

In 1871 Davies passed the management of &quot;The Mercury&quot; to his sons. In June 1872 he opened up the theatre building (which he then owned) to homeless people seeking temporary shelter due to floods. He caught a chill from which he died on 11 June 1872.

Davies&#x27; son John played first-class cricket for Tasmania and was thrice Mayor of Hobart.

<doc id="799463" wikidata="Q7837689" url="?curid=799463" title="Treelang">
<text>Treelang is a &quot;toy&quot; programming language distributed with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to demonstrate the features of its code-generation backend. It was developed by Tim Josling, based on a language called Toy created by Richard Kenner. During the GCC 4.3 release cycle, a patch was committed to remove the language, because of high maintenance costs outweighing its benefits and also because it was no longer considered a good front-end example by GCC developers.

==Overview==
Treelang is loosely based on the C programming language, but omits complex features such as pointers, arrays, and records. It has never been completed, although there were plans to gradually add more demonstrative features.

From the documentation distributed with GCC:

: Treelang is a sample language, useful only to help people understand how to implement a new language front end to GCC. It is not a useful language in itself other than as an example or basis for building a new language. Therefore only language developers are likely to have an interest in it.

==Example==
The following example is from the Treelang documentation, modified by adding the main function, and is included to give an impression of the Treelang syntax and semantics:
 // function prototypes
 // function &#x27;add&#x27; taking two ints and returning an int
 external_definition int add(int arg1, int arg2);
 external_definition int subtract(int arg3, int arg4);
 external_definition int first_nonzero(int arg5, int arg6);
 external_definition int double_plus_one(int arg7);
 external_definition int main();

 // function definition
 add
 // return the sum of arg1 and arg2
 return arg1 + arg2;
 
 subtract
 return arg3 - arg4;

 double_plus_one
 // aaa is a variable, of type integer and allocated at the start of the function
 automatic int aaa;
 // set aaa to the value returned from add, when passed arg7 and arg7 as the two parameters
 aaa=add(arg7, arg7);
 aaa=add(aaa, aaa);
 aaa=subtract(subtract(aaa, arg7), arg7) + 1;
 return aaa;
 
 first_nonzero
 // C-like if statement
 if (arg5)
 return arg5;
 else
 }
 return arg6;

 // Like C, &#x27;gtreelang&#x27; needs the main to be defined to create an executable.
 main
 return double_plus_one(5);


Note that C-style comments (with the codice_1 syntax) are not legal in Treelang.

==Commentary==
As a simple, C-like language, Treelang is interoperable with C and C++ with some minor datatype caveats. The designated filename extension for Treelang source code files is codice_2. Treelang source code can be compiled by invoking codice_3 normally or as codice_4. Both invocations run the Treelang frontend (internally labelled codice_5) and produce machine code as output. Treelang can also issue some warning messages.

<text>Provins () is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France. Known for its well-preserved medieval architecture and importance throughout the Middle Ages as an economic center and a host of annual trading fairs, Provins became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001.

==Administration==
With 11,958 inhabitants (2021), Provins is not the largest town in the arrondissement of Provins, but it is the seat (&quot;sous-préfecture&quot;). Provins is also the seat of the canton of Provins.

==History==

There are signs of human occupation in the area as early as the paleolithic era.

=== Roman era ===
Provins was at the crossroads of two major regional corridors in Roman Gaul: one from Soissons to Troyes and one towards Sens in the south.

=== Medieval era ===
As proof of its growing importance, by the 9th century, Provins was minting its own coin, the “denier provinois,” and Charlemagne had sent his missi dominici to the town. Under the protection of the Counts of Champagne, Provins hosted one of the largest Champagne fairs, an agricultural and trade fair crucial to the medieval economy. In the upper portion of the town, the fair would be held twice a year, in May and November, whereas in the lower town, there was a yearly market in September. During that time, Provins also because a banking center, with the &quot;denier&quot; being widely accepted throughout Europe. The fairs continued from 1120 until 1320.

King Philip IV visited Provins several times in the late 13th century, devastating the town with harsh taxes that ended its period of prosperity and caused residents to flee. The town was besieged numerous times and changed hands frequently in the 14th through 16th centuries. This political and economic instability reduced the importance of the city.

In one of the most famous events in Provins’ history, the recently crowned King Charles VII attended mass at the church, along with his royal court and saint Joan of Arc on August 3, 1429. This church keeps the Islamic silk chasuble that St Edmund had with him at his death.

=== Modern era ===
Being largely unaffected by the Industrial Revolution, Provins remained a small market town throughout the 19th century. The Germans occupied the town in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, and were only barely fought off in 1914 during the First World War.

==Population==
==Sights==

Provins is known for its well-preserved, original fortifications from the 12th century, such as the Tour César (the Caesar Tower) and city walls. Many of the residential and commercial buildings within the Upper Town are likewise from the 12th century; these buildings held the residences of merchants, stores and counting houses. Of the four main fair towns in the County of Champagne (Troyes, Lagny-sur-Marne, and Bar-sur-Aube), Provins is the only one that has retained much of its medieval character.

The Saint Quiriace Collegiate Church is located here. The Empress Galla Placidia is said to have presented Ancona in Italy with the relics of Judas Cyriacus. However, the saint&#x27;s head was situated at Provins, brought from Jerusalem by Henry I of Champagne, who built a church in this town to display it. It is still at the Saint Quiriace Collegiate Church, although construction work during the 12th century was never completed due to financial difficulties during the reign of Philippe le Bel. A dome was added in the 17th century, and the old families of Provins who lived in the upper town were called &quot;Children of the Dome.&quot; After the addition of the dome, however, no further restoration efforts have been made towards the church.
The police station (2010) is a piece of contemporary architecture designed by Parisian architects Philippe Ameller and Jacques Dubois.

Two sets of caves underlie parts of the town. The first type were probably used to store food in the Middle Ages. The second, deeper, type contains Bronze and Iron Age graffiti.
==Economy==

Provins has important rose cultivation. It produces all sorts of foods from roses, and its main specialties are rose petal jam, Provinois rose honey and rose candy. Provins also used to be a large producer of wine, with the medieval methods of wine-making still being carried out by residents, and some vineyards are still being used to produce.

<doc id="799465" wikidata="Q661162" url="?curid=799465" title="Arild">
<text>Arild () is a locality situated in Höganäs Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 522 inhabitants in 2010. It is located in the bay of Skälderviken in north-western Scania, approximately 30 km north of Helsingborg in Sweden. Arild belongs to Brunnby parish with its seat in Brunnby. The parish is represented in Arild by Arilds Chapel. The village was mostly concentrated around the chapel and the shoreline but has come to extend uphill towards Kullaberg, creating height differences between the various parts of the village. The coastline surrounding the village and the majority of the northern shore of the Kullen peninsula is mountainous.

==History==

The &quot;Arild Legend&quot; tells the story of a woman named Inger, a widow who single-handedly bore the responsibility of her two young sons, Arild and Tore. Inger decided to marry one of her many suitors, a particularly persistent one, master David, whose intentions, unfortunately, turned out to be less than noble. Master David made sure that Inger&#x27;s sons were aboard a ship that was set afire at sea in Skälderviken, thus securing an inheritance for himself and his own sons. Legend has it that Arild&#x27;s body washed ashore at what is today known as Arild and that Tore&#x27;s body perhaps drifted across Skälderviken to the place which is now called Torekov which is located on the Bjärre peninsula.

The evolution of the name Arild has gone through various changes since 1508 when the locality was referred to as &quot;Hellige Aruitz leye i Kuldenn&quot;. The village was also referred to as Hele Arveds Leye in 1569, Arillsläge in 1751 by Carl von Linné, Arildsläge in 1917 and finally established as Arild in 1929 when a local post office was opened in the village and a postal code had to be established.

Like Mölle, which is also located close to Kullaberg, on the Kullen peninsula, Arild has been a well known resort since the beginning of the 20th century. Amongst the first to discover Arild as a holiday resort were Europe&#x27;s fashionable elite. Arild was and still is a very popular with painters and other artists.

==Arild today==

The majority of the older architecture of Arild is located nearby to the small harbour that has been the center of the village together with the chapel since the early days. The construction of the current harbour started in 1841 and carried on with improvements until 1926. Improvements were made in 1934 and 1958 when the pier was extended and a small lighthouse was built respectively. The architecture surrounding the harbour dates back to the years when the population of Arild largely consisted of fishermen, these houses differ greatly from the rest of the village architecture in design. The majority of these houses were built around the beginning of the 20th century but some houses dates back to the 17th century and the 18th century. The local chapel Arilds Chapel is located not far from the harbour and dates back to the 15th century when it was first mentioned in a letter. The chapel was built in Sankt Arilds honour on the site of his burial according to the Arild Legend.

Several locations along the shoreline of Arild has been used as bathing locations since the early days of the village. There are more than ten locations that has been properly built for the purpose of recreational bathing and swimming. All of these locations are on the mountainous shoreline, the closest beach is located on the opposite side of the peninsula in Strandbaden. During the summer period Arild is also popular for various sporting and recreational activities such as Tennis, Golf and Sailing. Sailing takes place around the shoreline with the village harbour as its base. A Tennis court is located on the edge of the village while the Golf course if located a bit further from the village. Trekking and Hiking are also popular activities since the village is located at the foot of Kullaberg.

Two established hotels and taverns are also located in Arild, namely &quot;Rusthållargården&quot;, founded in 1892 as &quot;Hotel Arild&quot;, and &quot;Strand Hotell&quot;, founded in 1904 as &quot;Troedssons pensionat&quot;. When tourism in Arild reached its peak during the 19th century several other hotels operated in and around the village, most notably &quot;Turisthotellet Kullen&quot;, located uphill in the village.

== Cultural references ==
The Danish composer Siegfried Langgaard wrote part of his works while staying in Arild; the remaining sketches of his Second Piano Concerto were worked into a new concerto, &quot;From Arild&quot; by his son, Rued Langgaard.

<text>Lionel Pigot Johnson (15 March 1867 – 4 October 1902) was an English poet, essayist, and critic (although he claimed Irish descent and wrote on Celtic themes).

==Life==
Johnson was born in Broadstairs, Kent, England in 1867 and educated at Winchester College. While at Winchester, Johnson became friends with Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell. The two started a lengthy religious discussion that Russell later published as &quot;Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson&quot; (1919).

Johnson graduated from New College, Oxford, in 1890 and converted to Catholicism in June 1891. At that time, Johnson introduced Lord Alfred Douglas to his friend Oscar Wilde. Johnson later denounced Wilde in &quot;The Destroyer of a Soul&quot; (1892) and deeply regretted that he had unwittingly initiated the secret homosexual relationship that had devolved into a public scandal.

In 1893, Johnson published what some consider his greatest work, &quot;Dark Angel&quot;. During his lifetime, he published: &quot;The Art of Thomas Hardy&quot; (1894), &quot;Poems&quot; (1895), and &quot;Ireland and Other Poems&quot; (1897). Johnson was a member of the Rhymers&#x27; Club, and cousin to Olivia Shakespear (who dedicated her novel &quot;The False Laurel&quot; to him). 

Johnson died of a &quot;cerebral haemorrhage&quot;, per an inquest on 8 October 1902, after collapsing in The Green Dragon on Fleet Street in London. The story of Johnson&#x27;s being struck and killed by a hansom cab is a myth.

=== Legacy ===

* Eric Hoffman reviewed &quot;Incurable&quot; in the &quot;Fortean Times&quot; on 25 February 2019, saying, &quot;This handsome volume from the excellent Strange Attractor Press includes a lengthy, authoritative introduction by Antonia, which provides biographical and critical contexts...&quot;Incurable&quot; is an accessible introduction to the work of this minor, yet distinctive, poet.&quot; 
* On 1 May 2019 Alan Contreras reviewed &quot;Incurable&quot; in the &quot;Gay and Lesbian Review&quot;, saying Johnson&#x27;s: &quot;writing conjured worlds of the imagination&quot; and called Nina Antonia&#x27;s illustrated biography &quot;masterful, gorgeously written and packed with carefully researched gossip.&quot;

<text>The third USS &quot;Hornet&quot; was a brig-rigged (later ship-rigged) sloop-of-war in the United States Navy. During the War of 1812, she was the first U.S. Navy ship to capture a British privateer.

==Design==
&quot;Hornet&quot; was launched 28 July 1805 in Baltimore and commissioned there on 18 October, Master Commandant Isaac Chauncey in command.

&quot;Hornet&quot;″s design was a compromise between the six original U.S. frigates and coastal gunboats championed by President Thomas Jefferson. The fledgling Navy needed a light-draft vessel that was fast and maneuverable, but also possessing sufficient firepower to deter or defeat enemy ships. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s design is attributed to Josiah Fox, but her builder, William Price, is said to have altered it based on the successful lines of the Baltimore Clipper, of which he had significant experience.

During his time as captain, Chauncey reported significant problems with &quot;Hornet&quot;″s rigging, hindering her overall potential. In response to these reports, &quot;Hornet&quot;&#x27;s sister ship, , constructed at the Washington Navy Yard, had her rigging changed to three masts and afterward reported excellent performance at sea.

==1806–1812==
&quot;Hornet&quot; cruised the Atlantic coast until 29 March 1806 when she sailed to join the squadron protecting American commerce from threats of piracy in the Mediterranean. She returned to Charleston, South Carolina on 29 November 1807 and was decommissioned.

&quot;Hornet&quot; was recommissioned on 26 December 1808. She transported General James Wilkinson to New Orleans, Louisiana, cruised in home waters to enforce the Embargo Act, and carried dispatches to Holland, France, and England. From November 1810 to September 1811, Hornet was rebuilt in the Washington Navy Yard. Based on the success of &quot;Wasp&quot;, &quot;Hornet&quot; received a ship-rig with three masts carrying square sails. She also had two additional gun ports fitted, which increased her capacity to 20 guns. Instead of her original eighteen 9-pounder long guns, &quot;Hornet&quot; was fitted to carry eighteen 32-pounder carronades and two 12-pounder long guns.

==War of 1812==

At the outbreak of war, &quot;Hornet&quot; sailed under the command of Master Commandant James Lawrence. It was &quot;Hornet&quot; that carried the diplomatic messages from Britain, notifying the United States that the Royal Navy would continue impressment of Americans. Lawrence then sailed &quot;Hornet&quot; with Commodore John Rodgers&#x27; Squadron on a raiding voyage to South America. It was during this voyage when the privateer &quot;Dolphin&quot; was captured on 9 July 1812 — the first prize of the war taken by a naval vessel — which was subsequently recaptured by the British while en route to the United States.

In October, &quot;Hornet&quot; sailed south with , under Commodore William Bainbridge, to harass British shipping. In December, Lawrence spotted and blockaded in the harbor at Salvador, Brazil. When (74 guns) arrived and broke the blockade, Lawrence shifted his efforts to the Caribbean.
On 24 February 1813, &quot;Hornet&quot; engaged off Demerary (Guyana). &quot;Hornet&quot; forced &quot;Peacock&quot;, which had lost her captain and taken heavy casualties, to strike, but &quot;Peacock&quot; was so damaged that she sank shortly thereafter. &quot;Hornet&quot; then returned to New London, Connecticut. &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; initially reported that Captain Peake of &quot;Peacock&quot; and eight of her crew were killed in the action, and 27 were wounded; 19 men, who could not be rescued, went down with her when she sank, but &quot;Hornet&quot; rescued the rest. She herself had reportedly lost only one man killed and two wounded. She then arrived at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard on 19 March.

&quot;Hornet&quot; was then assigned to a squadron consisting of the frigates &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;Macedonian&quot; under the command of Commodore Stephen Decatur. The squadron was chased into the Thames River near New London and was blockaded. &quot;Hornet&quot; was able to escape from the blockade and resumed active service. The other two ships remained under blockade until the end of the war.

On 14 November 1814, under new command, &quot;Hornet&quot; sailed on a second raiding voyage to the South Atlantic. On 23 March 1815, she captured in a short battle off Tristan da Cunha. This was one of several naval engagements that took place after the war had ended. On 27 April, she engaged , having mistakenly identified her as a merchant vessel. &quot;Hornet&quot; managed to escape by throwing overboard boats, guns, and other equipment so to enable higher speed.

==Loss==
Following the war, &quot;Hornet&quot; cruised to the West Indies and Copenhagen in 1818; and, in 1819, to the Mediterranean. &quot;Hornet&quot; was later based at Key West and Pensacola, Florida to help end combat in the Caribbean Sea. She captured the pirate schooner &quot;Moscow&quot; 29 October 1821 off the coast of Santo Domingo.

She cruised throughout the Caribbean throughout the 1820s. In July 1822 under Captain Henley, &quot;Hornet&quot; was involved in action against &quot;Captain Paez&quot; as part of operations to suppress the illicit slave trade. &quot;General Paez&quot; had captured &quot;Theodore&quot;, carrying Africans from the West coast of Africa. &quot;Hornet&quot; in turn captured this ship and took it to the Spanish port Havana, Cuba.

She departed Pensacola for the last time on 4 March 1829, setting course for the coast of Mexico, and was never seen again. On 27 October 1829, the commander of the West Indies Squadron received information that &quot;Hornet&quot; had been dismasted in a gale off Tampico on 10 September 1829 and had foundered with the loss of all hands.

<text>USS &quot;Hornet was the fifth [[United States Navy]] ship to bear the name Hornet. She was originallyCSS &quot;Lady Stirling, a blockade runner built by James Ash at Cubitt Town, London in 1864 for the Confederate States Navy. She was badly damaged and captured by the United States Navy on 28 October 1864 off Wilmington, North Carolina.

==History==
Following condemnation by a prize court, &quot;Lady Sterling&quot; was bought by the U.S. Navy, repaired, armed, and commissioned as USS &quot;Lady Sterling&quot; and later renamed USS &quot;Hornet&quot; on 25 April 1865. In navy service she mainly operated in the Chesapeake Bay squadron. In October 1865, &quot;Hornet&quot; escorted the Confederate ironclad from Cuba to the United States.

&quot;Hornet&quot; was decommissioned on 15 December 1865 and sold into private ownership in 1869. After the war &quot;Hornet&quot; was involved in several filibustering expeditions to Cuba under the names &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Cuba&quot;, including an unsuccessful mission in January 1871 to deliver weapons and ammunition to Cuban rebels during the Ten Years&#x27; War.

<text>USS &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; (SSN-716), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Salt Lake City, Utah. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 15 September 1977 and her keel was laid down on 26 August 1980. She was launched on 16 October 1982 sponsored by Mrs. Kathleen Garn, and commissioned on 12 May 1984.

Actor Scott Glenn trained aboard, and was installed as (honorary) commander for a brief time, aboard &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; in preparation for his part as Bart Mancuso, Captain of in the film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was featured in The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mail Call&quot; when R. Lee Ermey answered viewer questions about life inside a submarine.

On 22 October 2004, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; returned from a deployment with the carrier strike group in the western Pacific Ocean, after surging, over a month ahead of schedule, in support of Summer Pulse &#x27;04. Port calls during the deployment included Guam, Sasebo, Yokosuka, Singapore, and Oahu, Hawaii.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; conducted an inactivation ceremony in San Diego on 26 October 2005, then departed for a transit under the polar ice. On 15 January 2006 she was decommissioned at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Over a year later, the hulk was taken under tow, arriving on 8 May 2007 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where she will be recycled and scrapped.

== Awards ==
&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; earned numerous awards during her eight full deployments, including three Battle &quot;E&quot; Battle Efficiency Awards, two Navy Unit Commendations, and four Meritorious Unit Commendations.

<text>The South Sydney City Council was a local government area covering the inner-eastern and inner-Southern Sydney suburbs of Sydney. It was forcibly merged with the Sydney City Council by the Government of New South Wales in 2004. The council chambers were located in the Erskineville Town Hall, with the administrative offices at Joynton Avenue in Zetland. The administrative offices were relocated to the TNT Towers in Redfern in 2001.

==History==
===First creation, 1968–1981===
The forerunner of the City of South Sydney was the Northcott Municipal Council (named after the late Governor Sir John Northcott, who served from 1946 to 1957 as the first Australian Governor of NSW), which was created on 1 January 1968 when the City of Sydney boundaries were changed. Newtown, Darlington, Erskineville, Alexandria, Waterloo and Redfern were combined to form the new council. The council was renamed the South Sydney Municipal Council on 1 December 1968, which was itself abolished on 1 January 1982 and all of these areas were returned to the City of Sydney.

===Second creation, 1989–2004===
In the late 1980s, the Government of New South Wales perceived that the Sydney City Council was insufficiently committed to some major infrastructural projects such as the monorail and the redevelopment of Darling Harbour. In March 1987 the government dismissed the Council of the City of Sydney and replaced it with commissioners who administered the city until 31 December 1988. A special inquiry and subsequent report (the Goran Report) advocated separating the Sydney central business district (CBD) from surrounding suburbs and replacing municipal government in the CBD with a special commission to ensure it was governed as a financial, commercial and tourist centre. In 1989, a new South Sydney City Council was created with the pre-1982 areas but also including most of Surry Hills and the eastern side of the City from The Domain to Boundary Road, including Woolloomooloo and Kings Cross, Potts Point and Elizabeth Bay which had not previously been a part of South Sydney.

The South Sydney City Council was established on 1 January 1989 under the City of Sydney Act 1988 with nine aldermen (Councillors from 1993) divided across three wards: North, South and East wards. The first election for the City of South Sydney was held on 3 December 1988.

In 2002, parts of the City of South Sydney and Leichhardt were proposed to be merged with the City of Sydney. In 2003, Potts Point, Elizabeth Bay, Kings Cross, Darlinghurst, Chippendale, Ultimo and parts of Rushcutters Bay, Camperdown and Darlington were transferred from South Sydney to the City of Sydney. As the financial viability of the residual City of South Sydney was under threat as a result, the City of Sydney and the City of South Sydney were combined by proclamation on 6 February 2004. The 2003 merger was perceived as an attempt to bring more working class Labor Party voters into the City of Sydney.

==Council==
===Final composition===
South Sydney City Council was composed of three wards, each electing three councillors each. The position of mayor was elected by councillors. The final election was held on 1 July 2000, and the makeup of the council following the election was as follows:

On 11 April 2003, South Ward councillor Peter Furness left the Australian Democrats to join the Labor Party. Furness was the first member of the Democrats elected to South Sydney City Council, and it was his vote that prevented Labor from holding the mayoralty from 2000 until 2002.

The final council, as of April 2003, was:

<text>USS &quot;Phoenix&quot; (SSN-702), a , was the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named &quot;Phoenix&quot; and the third to be named after the city, Phoenix, Arizona (the first two were named after the mythological bird). The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 31 October 1973, and her keel was laid down on 30 July 1977. She was launched on 8 December 1979, sponsored by Mrs. Betty Harvey Rhodes, wife of Congressman John J. Rhodes, and commissioned on 19 December 1981.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron Eight, home ported in Norfolk, Virginia, where she remained for 16 years. &quot;Phoenix&quot; spent the first years following her commissioning and Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) conducting several vital deployments and exercises. Highlighting 1983 was a deployment during which she operated in support of the Battle Group, performed oceanographic surveys, and conducted independent anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations. During the cruise, &quot;Phoenix&quot; made a port visit to , Western Australia, in July 1983, then transited the Panama Canal eastward en route to Norfolk to complete her record-setting 203-day, circumnavigation of the globe.

In the beginning of 1984, &quot;Phoenix&quot; conducted a major upkeep period followed by her being the first &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine to complete a Consolidated Anti-Submarine Readiness Test (CART). In August, following a Selective Restricted Availability (SRA), &quot;Phoenix&quot; fired 25 exercise torpedoes while conducting Prospective Commanding Officer (PCO) Operations and then successfully completed an unannounced Operational Reactor Safeguards Examination (ORSE). In November, &quot;Phoenix&quot; received the highest possible Tactical Effectiveness Factor during a Tactical Readiness Evaluation (TRE).

During the better part of 1985 and early 1986, &quot;Phoenix&quot; conducted four highly successful ASW missions in the Mediterranean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean, for which the crew was subsequently awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. &quot;Phoenix&quot; also participated in a major NATO exercise, completed an ORSE, and received a grade of &quot;Excellent&quot; during a Supply Management Inspection (SMI). &quot;Phoenix&quot; was awarded the Submarine Squadron Eight Communications &quot;Green C&quot; for her outstanding communications performance during 1985.

During 1986, &quot;Phoenix&quot;″s success continued as she and her crew exhibited extreme professionalism and operational proficiency while participating in a major Fleet Exercise (FLEETEX) and PCO Operations. After a superb performance on an ORSE, the ship was designated a &quot;Top Performer&quot; for her accomplishments during a TRE. The year came to a close with the Supply Department receiving the Submarine Squadron Eight &quot;Blue E&quot; for excellence in Supply Management during 1986.

1987 saw &quot;Phoenix&quot; on deployment from February to May, for which the ship was awarded her second Meritorious Unit Commendation. This was followed by a stand down for the crew. The ship then conducted Midshipman training, torpedo proficiency firings, and type training to round out the summer. Following the successful completion of a TRE and an ORSE, the Medical Department was recognized as the best in the squadron and was awarded the Medical &quot;Yellow M.&quot;

After completing torpedo proficiency firings and MK-48 Advanced Capability (ADCAP) Torpedo testing in early 1988, &quot;Phoenix&quot; once again conducted PCO Operations and participated in a major FLEETEX. &quot;Phoenix&quot; had the highest percentage of &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;sinkings&quot; of any other submarine participating in the exercises. After an ORSE in November, &quot;Phoenix&quot; remained in port to close out the year.

In 1989, &quot;Phoenix&quot; spent the majority of her time in Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a Depot Modernization Period (DMP) during which substantial portions of the fire control and sonar Systems were upgraded and the propulsion plant was significantly enhanced.

In early 1990, &quot;Phoenix&quot; completed the DMP and Post DMP Sea Trials. This was followed by Midshipman training and Sonar/Fire Control System Certification. The year was brought to a close after participating in a FLEETEX and successfully completing an ORSE.

During February 1991, &quot;Phoenix&quot; conducted a TRE and then began a Pre-Overseas Movement (POM) workup. Following POM Certification, &quot;Phoenix&quot; departed for the Mediterranean Sea where she conducted numerous independent operations and was presented with the prestigious Commander Sixth Fleet &quot;Hook &#x27;Em&quot; award for ASW excellence. Demonstrating the many roles of the fast attack submarine, she became the first SSN to deploy as an integral part of a Carrier Battle Group and conducted numerous exercises with .

Aside from conducting various local operations and Independent Steaming Exercises (ISE) in 1992, &quot;Phoenix&quot; underwent an SRA to upgrade weapons and sensor systems. During June and July, &quot;Phoenix&quot; performed an ORSE, a TRE, and a Nuclear Technical Weapons Proficiency Inspection (NTPI). &quot;Phoenix&quot; was presented with the Submarine Squadron Eight Tactical &quot;T&quot; Award as a testament to her war fighting readiness and effectiveness.

From April to May 1993, &quot;Phoenix&quot; conducted a deployment to the North Atlantic Ocean. She also performed well on her annual TRE, ORSE, and SMI. Hard work by the crew in preservation of the topside area and gear did not go unnoticed, as they were awarded the Submarine Squadron Eight Deck Seamanship &quot;D&quot; Award.

During 1994, &quot;Phoenix&quot; was deployed to the Northern Atlantic Ocean on two separate occasions for a total of six months. A September ORSE balanced the ship&#x27;s operational and training schedules for the year. &quot;Phoenix&quot; received her third Meritorious Unit Commendation for superb performance during January 1994 through March 1995 and Submarine Squadron Eight recognized her exceptional performance by presenting her with both the Tactical &quot;T&quot; and Anti-submarine Warfare &quot;A&quot; Award for 1994.

In March 1995, &quot;Phoenix&quot; returned from her Northern Atlantic Ocean deployment and conducted a SRA from July to October. From late October through mid November, &quot;Phoenix&quot; was at sea for ORSE workup and the ORSE. She received the Submarine Squadron Eight Deck Seamanship &quot;D&quot; for 1995.

After several at sea periods through June 1996, &quot;Phoenix&quot; conducted a TRE, an ORSE, and a Logistics Readiness Examination. The next POM workup began in July when the crew&#x27;s attention turned to fine tuning tactical skills in preparation for an upcoming Northern Atlantic Ocean deployment. &quot;Phoenix&quot; also received the Squadron Eight Damage Control &quot;DC&quot; Award for the year.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; conducted her final major deployment when she sailed to the North Atlantic Ocean in January and returned in April 1997. Following stand down and upkeep, &quot;Phoenix&quot; spent the summer at sea for Midshipman training, sonar testing, various V.I.P. cruises, and an unscheduled ORSE. &quot;Phoenix&quot; was inactivated on 18 September 1997 at Norfolk Naval Base, before departing Norfolk in late September 1997 en route for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine for decommissioning.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was decommissioned on 29 July 1998 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 July 1998. Ex-&quot;Phoenix&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, and was scheduled to begin disassembly on 1 March 2007.

As of 2016, the sail, diving planes, and rudder of USS Phoenix arrived in Phoenix, AZ by truck transport from the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington on Friday, Aug.12. The parts, weighing in at a total of 123,160 pounds, are being stored at the Papago Park Military Reservation until enough money has been raised to restore the parts, create a monument and place them at Steele Indian School Park near the Arizona State Veteran&#x27;s Home in Phoenix.

<text>USS &quot;Boise&quot; (SSN-764), a , is the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Boise, Idaho. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 6 February 1987 and her keel was laid down on 25 August 1988. She was launched on 23 March 1991, and commissioned on 7 November 1992.

==Service history==
During a Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) carried out in 1999, &quot;Boise&quot; was reported &quot;sunk&quot; by Dutch diesel-electric powered submarine . In the same exercise &quot;Walrus&quot; reportedly also took down eight other allied vessels, including the aircraft carrier and , flagship of the United States Sixth Fleet.

In 2002 &quot;Boise&quot; was assigned to the carrier strike group when the group took part in Operation Enduring Freedom.

In March 2003, &quot;Boise&quot; delivered some of the opening shots of Operation Iraqi Freedom when she launched a full load of Tomahawk missiles in support of the initial invasion. The ship and crew were later awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for their distinguished service in action.

In February 2017, &quot;Boise&quot; was no longer dive-certified as was awaiting scheduled maintenance at Norfolk. Due to congestion and delays in Navy shipyards, it was planned that &quot;Boise&quot; would receive maintenance at a private shipyard during Fiscal Year 2019. However, due to unforeseen delays she only entered drydock in early 2021. If she returns to service as scheduled in 2023, there would have been an eight-year pause between her patrols.

The long wait has been attributed to a ten year lapse in capabilities and logistic setbacks discovered during the retrofit and restoration work done on submarines and .

He was also the professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Akron, Akron, Ohio in 1906 and continued until 1911. He arrived at Denison University in 1911 where he was the professor and lecturer of astronomy and the director of the Warner and Swasey Observatory. He continued to teach at Denison University and lived in Granville, Ohio until his death in June 1943.

Biefeld joined the Yerkes Eclipse Expedition to Denver, Colorado in 1918. He was the research assistant at the Yerkes Observatory for the summer of 1919. Biefeld was part of the Yerkes Eclipse Expedition to Catalina Island in September 1923.

==In popular culture==

===Biefeld–Brown effect===
In popular culture Biefeld&#x27;s name has come to be associated with the Biefeld–Brown effect, an electrical effect where extremely high voltages can produce a type of propulsion, usually attributed an ionic wind but also associated with several anti-gravity theories. The effect was named by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown, a former student of Biefeld at Denison University in Ohio. Brown claimed Biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter although he seems to have named this effect many years after his association with Biefeld. Brown only attended Denison University for one year and their records show no evidence of any research or experiments being carried out by Biefeld/Brown during Biefeld&#x27;s professorship there.

Brown himself seemed to think the effect demonstrated a connection between electricity and gravity, which he thought was being negated by the high voltage.

===Association with Albert Einstein===
Publications promoting the Biefeld–Brown effect/Electrogravitics/anti-gravity tend to emphasize Paul Biefeld&#x27;s standing as a physicist via titling him a &quot;colleague of Albert Einstein&quot;, based on the fact that Biefeld and Einstein attended ETH Zürich at the same time. Later in life Biefeld recounted that Einstein borrowed his class notes but there is little evidence of anything more than a passing acquaintance between the two students.

<text>USS &quot;Farragut&quot; (DD-300) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Clemson&quot; class was a repeat of the preceding although more fuel capacity was added. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Clemson&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Farragut&quot;, named for Admiral David Farragut, was laid down by the Union Iron Works Plant of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in San Francisco, California on 4 July 1918.

It was sponsored by Marie Charlier Potts, wife of Templin Morris Potts, and launched on 21 November 1918. On 4 June 1920, it was commissioned.

&quot;Farragut&quot; arrived at San Diego, California 3 July 1920, and was at once placed in reserve until 31 March 1922. Then she took up a regular training schedule along the west coast, from the Panama Canal Zone to Oregon. On 27 July 1923, at Seattle, Washington, she took part in a review taken by President Warren G. Harding, on his way home from a visit to Alaska. Returning to San Diego, she, with eight other ships, grounded on a foggy night on Honda Point, 8 September, in the Honda Point Disaster. &quot;Farragut&quot; and one other ship were able to get clear with only minor damage, while the others remained stranded on the rocky shore.

In both 1924 and 1927, &quot;Farragut&quot; sailed into the Caribbean for fleet concentrations for maneuvers, in 1927 continuing north to visit New York, Newport, Rhode Island, and Norfolk, Virginia. Her first visit to the Hawaiian Islands was in the summer of 1925, during which she acted as station ship during the flight of seaplanes from the west coast to Hawaii. Again in the spring of 1928 &quot;Farragut&quot; exercised in the Hawaiians.

&quot;USS Farragut&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego on 1 April 1930, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 July 1930 and sold for scrap on 31 October 1930 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

<text>Charles Henry Madge (10 October 1912 – 17 January 1996) was an English poet, journalist and sociologist, now most remembered as a founder of Mass-Observation.

==Life==
Charles Henry Madge was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, son of Lieut-Col. Charles Madge (1874–1916) and Barbara Hylton-Foster (1882–1967). He was educated at Winchester College and studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He was a literary figure from his early twenties, becoming a friend of David Gascoyne; like Gascoyne he was generally classed as a surrealist poet. Madge&#x27;s essay &quot;Surrealism for the English&quot; (&quot;New Verse&quot; magazine, December 1933) argued that potential English surrealist poets would need both a knowledge of &quot;the philosophical position of the French surrealists&quot; and &quot;a knowledge of their own language and literature&quot;. Madge contributed the essay &quot;Pens Dipped In Poison&quot; (1934) to &quot;Left Review&quot;, a strong critique of the British intellectuals who had supported the First World War. He worked for a spell as a reporter for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. By the end of the 1930s, he was more involved in the Mass-Observation social research movement, which he co-founded in 1937, socialist realism (in theory) and Communism. By the 1940s, however, Madge was moving away from Communism.

In 1947 he became the Social Development Officer for Stevenage New Town, and in 1950 (despite never having completed a university degree) he was appointed as the first Professor of Sociology at the University of Birmingham, a position he held until 1970.

Faber and Faber published his poetry as &quot;The Disappearing Castle&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Father Found&quot; (1941).

==Family==
In 1938, Charles Madge married the poet Kathleen Raine (previously married to Hugh Sykes Davies). He had two children by Kathleen Raine: Anna Madge (b. 1934) and James Wolf Madge (1936–2006) who married Jennifer Alliston, daughter of architects Jane Drew and James Thomas Alliston. In 1942 he married Inez Pearn, a young novelist who published under the name of Elizabeth Lake. She had previously been married to Stephen Spender. They had two children: a daughter and a son. Inez died in 1976. Charles married his third wife, Evelyn Brown, in 1979.

<text>The James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve, a unit of the University of California Natural Reserve System, is a ecological reserve and biological field station located at an altitude of in a wilderness area of the San Jacinto Mountains near Lake Fulmor in Riverside County, California, United States.

==Overview==
The James Reserve property was purchased in 1966 by the University of California, Riverside, from Harry and Grace James.

In addition to acting as a protected natural area for teaching and research in the sciences, it is also available as an engineering testing ground for various sensor-related and ecosystem monitoring technologies.

The primary research focus at the James Reserve has been ecological monitoring using ecological sensing systems. Over the internet, researchers, students and the interested public may unobtrusively visit and view nature via a webcam observatory, which includes an interactive robotic camera. Devices in the outdoor laboratory allow non-intrusive, around-the-clock monitoring.

The Director of the Reserve is Dr. Jennifer Gee, who received her Ph.D. from Princeton University, in the field of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

==Access==
Overnight accommodations for researchers and school groups may be made for the on-site Trailfinders Lodge. Visitation is by permission only.
