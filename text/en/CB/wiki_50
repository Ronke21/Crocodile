<text>James Laurence Balsillie (born February 3, 1961) is a Canadian businessman and philanthropist. He was the former chair and co-chief executive officer of the Canadian technology company Research In Motion (BlackBerry), which at its 2011 peak made billion (equivalent to $billion in ) in annual sales.

Since leaving Blackberry in 2012, Balsillie has taken up a number of roles in Canadian business and society. He is the founder of the Balsillie School of International Affairs at the University of Waterloo, the Centre for International Governance and Innovation (CIGI) think tank, and serves as chair of the Canadian Council of Innovators.

==Early life and education==
Jim Balsillie was born in 1961 in Seaforth, Ontario to Raymond Balsillie, an electronics technician at Ontario Hydro, and Laurel Balsillie. The family moved to Peterborough when Jim was five years old. He received a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Trinity College at the University of Toronto in 1984, where he was also a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity. He earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1989. He also earned a PhD from Wilfrid Laurier University in 1992.

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduating from Harvard Business School, Balsillie was an executive
vice-president and chief financial officer of technology for Cambridge, Ontario-based design and construction services company Sutherland-Schultz. He left that position in 1992 when Sutherland-Schultz was sold to the Vollmer Group.

===Research In Motion===
In 1992, after initially making overtures to buy the company, Balsillie invested (equivalent to roughly 238,000 in 2024) in Research In Motion (RIM) and joined as co-CEO with founder Mike Lazaridis. The company had fewer than ten employees and would eventually become the &quot;international powerhouse&quot; called BlackBerry Limited, with as many as 28,000 employees. Both men prospered from the partnership: Lazaridis looked after the technological side and Balsillie looked after the sales, business and accounting side.

Many people considered that Balsillie infused RIM with &quot;institutional arrogance&quot; as he remade the landscape of the smartphone industry. He was &quot;feared and respected&quot; by senior managers within his hierarchy. The twin-CEO structure of Lazaridis and Balsillie eventually became cumbersome and inhibited their competition with the Apple iPhone and Google&#x27;s Android devices.

On March 5, 2007, Balsillie resigned his role as chairman of RIM as the firm reported over million (equivalent to $million in ) in past stock option accounting errors after an extensive review. He retained his roles as co-chief executive and director. On May 17, 2007, RIM announced that &quot;Consistent with current best practices in corporate governance, the roles of Chairman and CEO have been separated.&quot;

In June 2007, Apple brought its first touchscreen smartphone to the market. BlackBerry would not have a touch-screen smartphone until after Balsillie&#x27;s departure from the executive suite.

In February 2009, as part of the penalties and sanctions approved by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) in settling the improper option practices, which the OSC called a &quot;fundamental failure of governance&quot;, Balsillie was forced to resign as a director of RIM. In May 2010, almost immediately after the OSC sanctions expired, Balsillie was reappointed to the board, in spite of strong shareholder objections, and notwithstanding RIM&#x27;s earlier public representations that the roles of chairman and CEO were separated.

BlackBerry lost its market dominance to Google&#x27;s Android technology in 2010, when the operating system of the machine, BlackBerry OS, had not been updated since March 2002.

At the end of 2011, Balsillie was the third largest shareholder of the company, holding 5.1% of the outstanding shares. But that June, BlackBerry cut 2,000 employees, or 11% of its global workforce, and the joint CEOs reduced their pay to $1. The share value had tumbled from $137.41 in 2008 to $14.80 at the end of 2011. By then, the iPhone from Apple had launched and cornered the mobile apps market, and some investors called for resignations from the executive suite.

On January 22, 2012, Balsillie and co-CEO Mike Lazaridis resigned from their positions and were replaced by RIM Chief Operating Officer Thorsten Heins. Two months later, on March 29, 2012, RIM announced that Balsillie would be stepping down from the board of directors. He resigned from the Board due to strategic differences with Heins, who abandoned the licensing strategy that Balsillie was pursuing. One publication blamed &quot;managerial gridlock&quot; and deteriorating product quality for BlackBerry&#x27;s fall from grace in the years from 2010 to 2013 and beyond. The decline was steep for RIM: in the span of five years, the company had gone from Canada&#x27;s most valuable property, surpassing even the biggest bank, to a tenth of its former value.

Balsillie commercialised 44,000 patents during his career at RIM, and claims he is &quot;the largest commercial IP protagonist in the history of [Canada].&quot;

===Failed NHL ownership bids===
Balsillie has been involved in at least three attempts to buy a National Hockey League franchise with the overt intention of moving it to Hamilton, Ontario. On October 5, 2006, Balsillie made a bid to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins franchise for million (equivalent to $million in ) from owners Mario Lemieux and Ronald Burkle. On December 15, 2006, Balsillie withdrew his bid to buy the team after receiving a notice from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman that the league would negotiate the arena deal on his behalf and the league also wanted the right to take over the team if necessary.

On May 23, 2007, it was announced that Balsillie had reached a tentative agreement to buy the Nashville Predators from Craig Leipold. On June 28, 2007, CBC.ca reported that Leipold had decided not to sign a binding agreement with Balsillie. Though Balsillie offered lip service that he would keep the team in Nashville, he reactivated a deal to become the primary tenant of Copps Coliseum in Hamilton and was already selling season tickets in the city, which influenced the decision to deny Balsillie the Predators.

On May 5, 2009, Balsillie made an offer of US$212.5million (equivalent to $million in ) to purchase the Phoenix Coyotes following the team&#x27;s filing for bankruptcy protection in Arizona. In a press release from Toronto, the offer to purchase was described as conditional on relocation to Southern Ontario. At the request of then-owner, Jerry Moyes, Balsillie agreed to post debtor-in-possession financing of $17million (equivalent to $million in ) to allow the Coyotes to operate in advance of a restructuring or a sale. A few hours later, the NHL, citing a proxy agreement signed by Moyes, removed him from all decision-making regarding the future of the Coyotes. On June 15, 2009, Judge Redfield T. Baum rejected Balsillie&#x27;s bid to purchase the Coyotes from the bankruptcy trustee. Judge Baum&#x27;s ruling stated that he did not have the power to force the team to move and that Balsillie&#x27;s June 29 deadline did not give the court enough time to resolve all the issues in the case. On September 30, 2009, Balsillie&#x27;s bid was again rejected by Judge Baum, who also rejected the NHL&#x27;s bid. Balsillie&#x27;s bid was rejected &quot;with prejudice,&quot; preventing him from making another bid for the Coyotes. Balsillie did not appeal the ruling.

It was rumoured that Balsillie made an unnamed bid to purchase the Buffalo Sabres during their sale in 2011 to Terry Pegula. It was also rumoured that Balsillie was interested in purchasing the Atlanta Thrashers prior to their 2011 purchase, relocation, and rebranding as the Winnipeg Jets by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, but neither of these rumours was confirmed.

=== Philanthropic work and awards ===

Balsillie is a philanthropist who supports numerous local and national initiatives. In 2007, he donated million (equivalent to $million in ) to the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University and the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) as part of a $100million (equivalent to $million in ) initiative to create the Balsillie School of International Affairs (BSIA). Balsillie created the Canadian International Council (CIC) through a partnership with the Canadian Institute of International Affairs (CIAA) and CIGI. He is also the founder of the Council of Canadian Innovators.

Balsillie has contributed resources and time to organizations such as Waterloo Children&#x27;s Museum, Grand River Hospital, the Canadian Olympic Foundation and others.

In 2012, Osgoode Hall Law School faculty council rejected Balsillie&#x27;s proposed $60million (equivalent to $million in ) collaboration between the school and CIGI, split into two equal donations by each of the CIGI and the Government of Ontario to establish a school of international relations at York University and fund 10 research chairs in international law.

In June 2013, the Harper government appointed Balsillie as Chair of Sustainable Development Technology Canada.

In October 2022, he published an op-ed in The Globe and Mail critical of the Trudeau government for proposing the Digital Charter Implementation Act 2022 (Bill C-27), writing that it &quot;normalizes and expands surveillance and treats privacy as an obstacle to corporate profits, not as a fundamental human right or even a right to effective consumer protection.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jim Balsillie married his wife in 1989 in Hamilton, Ontario. They had two children before separating in 2011.

He serves as the Honorary Captain of HMCS Star in the Royal Canadian Navy.

When asked about potential political aspirations, Balsillie stated that &quot;I’d be the worst politician in the world—if I don’t like people, I can’t hide it&quot;. He maintains that all three major political parties in Canada have made unsuccessful efforts to recruit him.

== In popular culture ==
Glenn Howerton portrayed Balsillie in the 2023 film &quot;BlackBerry&quot;. Balsillie himself states Howerton&#x27;s portrayal and the film&#x27;s portrayal of the culture at RIM are inaccurate. Balsillie was portrayed as arrogant, manipulative, and aggressive in the film. He has said the consensus on his characterisation is that it was &quot;5% accurate, and 95% made-up&quot;, but also said that he could take being teased, having lived 60 years with his last name containing the word &quot;silly&quot;. Balsillie helped promote the film by doing television interviews and attending premieres. He praised Howerton&#x27;s performance as &quot;brilliant&quot;.

<text>Petergof (), known as Petrodvorets () from 1944 to 1997, is a municipal town in Petrodvortsovy District of the federal city of St. Petersburg, located on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland.

The town hosts one of two campuses of Saint Petersburg State University and the Petrodvorets Watch Factory, one of the leading Russian watch manufactures. A series of palaces and gardens, laid out on the orders of Peter the Great and sometimes called the &quot;Russian Versailles&quot;, is also situated there. The palace-ensemble along with the city center is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
==Palaces, fountains, and gardens==

Petergof is named after the Peterhof Grand Palace, a sixteen-meter-high bluff lying less than a hundred meters from the shore. The so-called Lower Gardens (&quot;Nizhny Sad&quot;), at comprising the better part of the palace complex land area, are confined between this bluff and the shore, stretching east and west for roughly . The majority of Peterhof&#x27;s fountains are contained here, as are several small palaces and outbuildings. East of the Lower Gardens lies the Alexandria Park with 19th-century Gothic Revival structures such as the Gothic Chapel.

Atop the bluff, near the middle of the Lower Gardens, stands the Grand Palace (&quot;Bolshoy Dvorets&quot;). To the south of it are the comparatively small Upper Gardens (&quot;Verkhny Sad&quot;). Upon the bluff&#x27;s face below the Palace is the Grand Cascade (&quot;Bolshoy Kaskad&quot;). This and the Grand Palace are the centerpiece of the entire complex. At its foot begins the Sea Channel (&quot;Morskoy Kanal&quot;), one of the most extensive waterworks of the Baroque period, which bisects the Lower Gardens.
==St. Petersburg State University==
Besides the downtown campus, certain Saint Petersburg State University&#x27;s schools and departments are located in Petergof:
*Graduate School of Management&#x27;s campus in Mikhailovka (under reconstruction)
*Faculty of Biology and Soil Studies&#x27; research center in Sergievka (Leuchtenberg Palace)
*Petrodvorets Complex including four faculties:
:*Applied Mathematics and Control Processes
:*Chemistry
:*Mathematics and Mechanics
:*Physics
*seven research institutes:
:*Astronomy
:*Chemistry
:*Computational Mathematics and Control Processes
:*Laser Research
:*Mathematics and Mechanics
:*Radiophysics
:*Physics
*as well as 12 dormitories and a number of infrastructure objects.

The Petrodvorets Complex dates back to 1960s when it was decided to copy best international practices and to construct a brand-new suburban campus for the University, which had a crucial need for new premises. However, the idea was said to be widely opposed by the faculty, who did not want to commute two hours a day, and as few as four faculties relocated to Petergof.

In the 1990s the number of students from other regions fell significantly, and the University sold many of its downtown dormitories. When the trend reversed, the need for housing made the University administration accommodate most students in Petergof, even those studying in downtown faculties, which has created certain tensions. Still, the idea of a suburban campus seems to be persistent, as the Government of the Russian Federation has decided to hand over the Mikhailovka estate to the University to reconstruct it and house the Graduate School of Management&#x27;s campus.

Due to the extensive presence of research facilities, mainly belonging to St. Petersburg State University, Petergof was named a naukograd in 2005.

==Petrodvorets Watch Factory==
Russia&#x27;s oldest factory was founded by Peter the Great in 1721 first as a lapidary plant to help in the construction of the Peterhof Palaces but also other Palaces in St. Petersburg. It started to produce equipment and parts for the watch industry in the 1920s. After World War II, the factory started to produce complete watches under the brand name &quot;Pobeda&quot; and from 1961 under the brand Raketa. in 1985 the factory had 7500 employees and was producing 5 million mechanical watches per year. Today, it is the last watch factory in Russia producing its own movements from A to Z, though the production is much smaller than it used to be.

==Telegraph Station==
==Transportation==
The town is served by three railway stations (Novy Petergof, Stary Petergof, and Universitet). The palaces of Peterhof are accessible by sea via hydrofoils based near the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. The palace is also accessed by road. Public transit and private van services make trips from Saint Petersburg.

The Upper Gardens are accessible, but entry to the Lower Gardens requires the purchase of tickets (not included in the boat fee for visitors arriving by hydrofoil). The palaces and grotto are accessible only as part of guided tours.

==Local government==
Petergof is a municipal entity - an intracity territory of the federal city of St. Petersburg. Local self-government is carried out on the basis of the charter, which was adopted by the resolution of the municipal council of the municipal formation of the city of Petergof dated 5 November 2008 No. 54-n.

The current body of local self-government - the Municipal Council - has been operating since 1998. As a result of the elections on 14 September 2014, a new composition of the fifth convocation was elected (out of 19 deputies: 18 from United Russia and 1 from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).

The head of the municipal district of Petergof (since 2019) is deputy of the Municipal Council Alexander Shifman.

The executive body of local self-government is the local administration, headed by Tatyana Yegorova.

==Sister cities==
* Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany
* Le Blanc-Mesnil, France

Former sister cities:
* Sopot, Poland

On 10 March 2022, the Polish town of Sopot terminated its partnership with Peterhof as a response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI, pronounced &quot;see-jee&quot;) is an independent, non-partisan think tank on global governance. CIGI supports research, forms networks, advances policy debate and generates ideas for multilateral governance improvements. CIGI&#x27;s interdisciplinary work includes collaboration with policy, business and academic communities around the world. 

Until September 2014, CIGI was headquartered in the former Seagram Museum in the uptown district of Waterloo, Ontario. It is now situated in the CIGI Campus, which also houses the CIGI Auditorium and the Balsillie School of International Affairs (BSIA).

==History==
CIGI was founded in 2001 by Jim Balsillie, then co-CEO of Research In Motion (BlackBerry). Balsillie made an initial donation of $20 million to establish the New Economy Institute (renamed CIGI in 2002), with Mike Lazaridis, his then co-CEO at RIM, contributing an additional $10 million. The combined $30 million in funds was matched by the Government of Canada in 2003.

Among CIGI&#x27;s first staff was its initial executive director John English, director of public affairs John Milloy and distinguished fellows Andrew F. Cooper and Paul Heinbecker. The first CIGI International Board of Governors (IBG) meeting was held in October 2003, with early members including Jagdish Bhagwati, Joe Clark, José Ángel Gurría, and Anne-Marie Slaughter.
In 2005, CIGI published its first working paper. In 2007, CIGI partnered with the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University to launch the BSIA. In 2009, CIGI announced plans to house the BSIA within a &quot;CIGI Campus&quot; that would be built alongside its headquarters in Waterloo. The resulting $69 million complex received federal and provincial funding totalling $50 million through the Knowledge Infrastructure Program and Ontario&#x27;s 2009 budget. The City of Waterloo donated the land for the campus through a 99-year lease. Construction of the CIGI Campus was completed in November 2011.

In May 2012, Rohinton P. Medhora joined CIGI as president, after having served on CIGI&#x27;s International Board of Governors since 2009. Medhora is former vice president of programs at the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). Medhora succeeded former CIGI executive director by Thomas A. Bernes, who previously held high-level positions at the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Government of Canada.

The centre was downsized in 2019 when 21 jobs were cut and again in 2020 when another 11 positions were eliminated according to a news report. The Budget was reduced to $8 million from the previous $12 million. These steps were necessary because the Government of Ontario cut all funding (approximately $3.2 million per annum) in 2019. A statement from CIGI stated that it would make &quot;meaningful changes in how we operate, including streamlined decision-making, improved strategic planning and expanded partnerships&quot;. The organization&#x27;s financial report at the end of July 2019 indicated that CIGI remained well-funded with $175 million in assets.

In 2019, CIGI ranked 30th globally out of 8,000+ think tanks in the Global Go To Think Tank Index.

==Research initiatives==
While CIGI&#x27;s early research focused solely on international relations and the international economy. The centre&#x27;s research has since evolved and expanded. CIGI&#x27;s 2020–2025 Strategic Plan defines a new era for the organization focused on one of the most pressing issues of our time: digital governance that crosscuts topics related to big data and platform governance and builds upon existing expertise in the areas of security, trade, law and economics.

==Publications==
CIGI publishes peer-reviewed papers, special reports, policy briefs and conference reports that are outputs of its research programs. These publications are available for free download through a Creative Commons license. CIGI also publishes books under its CIGI Press imprint, which are the result of special projects and research by CIGI fellows and scholars. Titles include: &quot;Schism: America, China and the Fracturing of the Global Trading System; Laid Low: Inside the Crisis That Overwhelmed Europe and the IMF&quot;; &quot;Look Who’s Watching: Surveillance, Treachery and Trust Online&quot;; &quot;Complexity’s Embrace: The International Law Implications of Brexit&quot;; &quot;Reflections on Canada’s Past, Present and Future in International Law&quot;; &quot;Tug of War: Negotiating Security in Eurasia&quot;; and &quot;The Fabric of Peace in Africa: Looking beyond the State&quot;. CIGI&#x27;s books are distributed globally through McGill-Queen&#x27;s University Press, and are available via multiple e-book platforms and libraries.

==Partners==
Since its inception, CIGI has partnered with other think tanks and organizations from around the world. Current partnerships include the Institute for New Economic Thinking, an organization founded by George Soros in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008; The Africa Portal, an online resource that seeks to broaden the availability, accessibility and use of policy research on issues critical to the future of Africa; The Balsillie School of International Affairs which is a unique three-way partnership among CIGI, Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Waterloo; The Canada-India Track 1.5 Dialogue on Innovation, Growth and Prosperity, a three-year initiative between the Centre and Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations; The Forum on Information and Democracy, an international entity led by Reporters Without Borders to implement the International Partnership on Information and Democracy; and &quot;The Lancet&quot; &amp; &quot;Financial Times&quot; Commission, Governing Health Futures 2030: Growing Up in a Digital World.

==Facilities==
After purchasing the former Seagram Museum from the City of Waterloo, CIGI moved into the facility in 2003. Designed by Barton Myers Associates, Inc., the Governor General Medal–winning building houses CIGI&#x27;s main offices for staff and fellows, and provides a number of unique spaces for public events and workshops. Since 2010, the building also contains the CIGI Broadcast Studio, available to news organizations for television and radio interviews of CIGI experts. CIGI also hosts the CIGI Campus Library, featuring the John Holmes Collection, which began as the library of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs (CIIA) in 1928.

<text>The Seagram Museum was a museum in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, preserving the heritage of the once venerable Canadian distillery Seagram. Located at 57 Erb Street West, the museum operated from May 1984 to March 1997. Designed by architect Barton Myers, it was built at a cost of $4.75 million and its entrance was a renovated late-19th century rack warehouse from the Seagram plant. Plans for the museum were announced in 1981. Peter Swann, a former director of the Royal Ontario Museum, was hired as the first director and oversaw the creation of the Seagram Museum. It had a variety of exhibits illustrating everyday life in the liquor distillery in the late 19th and early 20th century.

The company closed its Waterloo plant in 1992, and the museum continued to operate for another five years. It narrowly escaped a fire in 1993 that destroyed the building next to it.

The City of Waterloo purchased the Seagram property for $4 million in the fall of 1997. The museum donated its archives to the University of Waterloo. Two former barrelhouses on the site were converted into condominia while the museum became an office building, leased to software company Waterloo Maple. The company moved into the renovated building in June 1998.

In July 2002, the city sold the building to the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) for $2.5 million. In September 2003, Waterloo Maple left the building and CIGI moved in. In 2010 it also housed Project Ploughshares. E-commerce company Shopify moved into the building in 2016. 

Some of the museum&#x27;s collection was transferred to the City of Waterloo and is on display at the City of Waterloo Museum, which opened in 2009.

==Affiliations==
The Museum was affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

<doc id="818931" wikidata="Q370993" url="?curid=818931" title="John L. Sullivan">
<text>John Lawrence Sullivan (October 15, 1858 – February 2, 1918), known simply as John L. among his admirers, and dubbed the &quot;Boston Strong Boy&quot; by the press, was an American boxer. He is recognized as the first heavyweight champion of gloved boxing, &quot;de facto&quot; reigning from February 7, 1882, to September 7, 1892. He is also generally recognized as the last heavyweight champion of bare-knuckle boxing under the London Prize Ring Rules, being a cultural icon of the late 19th century America, arguably the first boxing superstar and one of the world&#x27;s highest-paid athletes of his era. Newspapers&#x27; coverage of his career, with the latest accounts of his championship fights often appearing in the headlines, and as cover stories, gave birth to sports journalism in the United States and set the pattern internationally for covering boxing events in media, and photodocumenting the prizefights.

==Early life==
Sullivan was born on October 15, 1858, in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, to Irish immigrant parents, Michael Sullivan from Abbeydorney, County Kerry and Catherine Kelly from Athlone, County Westmeath.

He attended public schools in his native Boston, attending the Dwight Grammar School and performing well academically.

Sullivan&#x27;s parents aspired for their son to enter the priesthood as a Catholic priest. To this end Sullivan enrolled at Boston College &quot;circa&quot; 1875 but after only a few months he turned to playing baseball professionally, earning the substantial sum of $30 to $40 a week for his efforts. As Sullivan recalled in 1883:

&quot;I threw my books aside and gave myself up to it. This is how I got into the base-ball profession, and I left school for good and all. From the base-ball business I drifted into boxing and pugilism.&quot;

==Boxing career==
As a professional fighter Sullivan was nicknamed &quot;The Boston Strongboy&quot;. As a youth he was arrested several times for participating in bouts where the sport was outlawed. He went on exhibition tours offering people money to fight him. Sullivan won more than 450 fights in his career.

There is some controversy among boxing historians over whether Sullivan had sparred with black boxer James Young at Schieffelin Hall in Tombstone, Arizona, in 1882. It is significant because Sullivan insisted that he never fought a black boxer. If it did occur, Sullivan possibly had a brief sparring session with the resident from Tombstone and did not regard it seriously as a bout.

In 1883–84 Sullivan went on a coast-to-coast tour by train with five other boxers. They were scheduled to hold 195 fights in 136 different cities and towns over 238 days. To help promote the tour, Sullivan announced that he would box anyone at any time during the tour under the Queensberry Rules for $250. He knocked out eleven men during the tour.

In Sullivan&#x27;s era, no formal boxing titles existed. He became a champion after defeating Paddy Ryan in Mississippi City, near Gulfport, Mississippi, on February 7, 1882. Modern authorities have retroactively labelled Ryan the &quot;Heavyweight Champion of America&quot;, but any claim to Ryan&#x27;s being a &quot;world champion&quot; would have been dubious; he had never contended internationally as Sullivan had.

Depending on the modern authority, Sullivan was first considered world heavyweight champion either in 1885 when he defeated Dominick McCaffrey in Ohio, in 1888 when he fought Charley Mitchell in France, or in 1889 when he knocked out Jake Kilrain in round 75 of a scheduled 80-round bout. Arguably, the real first World Heavyweight champion was Jem Mace, who defeated Tom Allen in 1870 at Kenner, Louisiana, but strong anti-British sentiment within the mostly Irish American boxing community of the time chose to disregard him.

When the modern authorities refer to the &quot;heavyweight championship of the world,&quot; they are likely referring to the championship belt presented to Sullivan in Boston on August 8, 1887. The belt was inscribed &quot;Presented to the Champion of Champions, John L. Sullivan, by the Citizens of the United States&quot;. Its centerpiece featured the flags of the US, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

===Charley Mitchell fight===
In March of 1888, Sullivan fought Charley Mitchell, an English prize-fighter, for 39 rounds in defense of his world title.

Mitchell was from Birmingham, England and had fought Sullivan in 1883, knocking him down in the first round before the police halted the contest in the third. Their second meeting took place on March 10, 1888 on the grounds of a chateau at Chantilly, France, with the fight held in driving rain. It went on for more than two hours, and by the end of the bout, both men were unrecognizable and had suffered so much damage that neither could lift his arms up to punch. Both men couldn&#x27;t continue, and the contest was considered a draw.

At this point, the local gendarmerie arrived and arrested Mitchell. He was confined to jail for a few days and later fined by the local magistrate, because bare-knuckled boxing was illegal in France at the time. Swathed in bandages, Sullivan was helped to evade the law and taken across the English Channel to spend the next few weeks convalescing in Liverpool.

===The Kilrain fight===

The Kilrain fight is considered to be a turning point in boxing history because it was the last world title bout fought under the London Prize Ring Rules, and therefore was the last-ever bare-knuckle heavyweight title bout. It was also one of the first sporting events in the United States to receive national press coverage.

Newspapers carried extensive pre-fight coverage which included reporting on the fighters&#x27; training and speculating on where the bout would take place. The traditional center of bare-knuckle fighting was New Orleans, but the governor of Louisiana had forbidden the fight in that state. Sullivan had trained for months in Belfast, New York, under trainer William Muldoon, whose biggest problem had been keeping Sullivan from liquor. A report on Sullivan&#x27;s training regimen in Belfast was written by famed reporter Nellie Bly and published in the &quot;New York World.&quot;

Rochester reporter Arch Merrill commented that occasionally Sullivan would &quot;escape&quot; from his guard. In Belfast village, the cry was heard, &quot;John L. is loose again! Send for Muldoon!&quot; Muldoon would snatch the champ away from the bar and take him back to their training camp.

On July 4, 1889, one Kentucky newspaper stated: &quot;The Sullivan-Kilrain prize fight which is to take place in Louisiana on next Monday is now the most talked-about event in sporting circles.&quot; The stakes were $20,000 and a diamond world championship belt.

On July 8, 1889, an estimated 3,000 spectators boarded special trains for the secret location, which turned out to be Richburg, a town just south of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The fight began at 10:30, and at first it looked like Sullivan was going to lose. &quot;The first fall and first blood were awarded to Kilrain, but the first knock-down was accomplished by Sullivan,&quot; reported one newspaper. &quot;Kilrain failed to knock Sullivan down at all.&quot; Sullivan vomited during the 44th round. However, the champion got his second wind and was able to turn things around for himself. After a grueling beatdown, Kilrain&#x27;s manager finally threw in the towel after the 75th round.

The Governor of Mississippi offered a $1,000 reward for each fighter.

Today, a historical marker is located at the site of the fight, just off Interstate 59, and the fight is immortalized by the Sullivan-Kilrain Road which runs through the site of the event, at the corner of Richburg Road.

===Later career===
Sullivan did not defend his title for the next three years. During this period, he was a friend and supporter of Irish boxer Ike Weir, who became America&#x27;s first Featherweight boxing champion in 1889. Both Weir and Sullivan were Boston natives, and Sullivan occasionally appeared at Weir&#x27;s bouts.
Sullivan agreed to defend his title in 1892, against challenger &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; Corbett. The match was on September 7 in New Orleans. It began at 9 p.m. in the electrically illuminated Olympic Club in the upper Ninth Ward neighborhood now known as Bywater section. The venue filled to its 10,000-person capacity despite hefty ticket prices ranging from $5 to $15 (approximately $142 to $426 in 2020). The heavyweight contest occurred under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, but it was neither the first title fight under those rules nor was it the first title fight using boxing gloves. Corbett was younger and faster, and his boxing technique enabled him to dodge Sullivan&#x27;s crouch and rush style. In the 21st round, Corbett landed a smashing left &quot;audible throughout the house&quot; that put Sullivan down for good. Sullivan was counted out and Corbett was then declared the new champion. When Sullivan was able to get back to his feet, he announced to the crowd the following: &quot;If I had to get licked, I&#x27;m glad I was licked by an American&quot;.

In 1895 Sullivan and Paddy Ryan joined the touring company of the musical &quot;The Wicklow Postman&quot;, and presented exhibition boxing matches prior to performances of the play.
Sullivan is considered the last bare-knuckle champion because no champion after him fought bare-knuckled. However, Sullivan had fought with gloves under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules as early as 1880 and he only fought bare-knuckled three times in his entire career (Ryan 1882, Mitchell 1888, and Kilrain 1889). His bare-knuckle image was created because his infrequent fights from 1888 up to the Corbett fight in 1892 had been bare-knucklers.

Sullivan retired to Abington, Massachusetts, but appeared in several exhibitions over the next 12 years, including a three-rounder against Tom Sharkey and a final two-rounder against Jim McCormick in 1905 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He continued his various careers outside boxing such as being a stage actor, speaker, celebrity baseball umpire, sports reporter, and bar owner. In his later years, Sullivan also gave up his lifelong addiction to alcohol and became a prohibition lecturer.

==Death==
The effects of prize fighting along with his being overweight and unhealthy after a long life of overindulging in food and alcohol took its toll on the boxer. Like most boxers of the time, he did not live a very long life. Sullivan died at age 59 at his home in Abington, Massachusetts, supposedly from heart disease. At the time of his death, Sullivan had a young boy named Willie Kelly in his custody. The priest of Sullivan&#x27;s church had brought Kelly, an orphan, to the front of the parish and encouraged anyone with the means to care for the boy to do so. Sullivan is buried in the Old Calvary Cemetery in Roslindale, a neighborhood of Boston. He died with 10 dollars in his pocket (equivalent to almost $180 in 2018). According to the county where Sullivan died he had an estate worth $3,675.

==Legacy==
Sullivan was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990, as a member of the hall&#x27;s original class. He had a record of 47 wins, 1 loss and 2 draws, with 38 wins by knockout, though many sources disagree on his exact record.

The barn where Sullivan trained still stands in the small town of Belfast, New York, and is now the Bare Knuckle Boxing Hall of Fame.

Sullivan and Corbett&#x27;s landmark 1892 fight is depicted in the 1942 Warner Brothers biopic &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot;, a fictionalized account of their relationship. Ward Bond portrayed Sullivan alternately as a fiery peacock of a heavyweight champion and, after his title loss, as a sweet, sentimental good sport. Sixteen years later, actor Roy Jenson played Sullivan in the 1958 episode, &quot;The Gambler and the Lady&quot;, of the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Sullivan in his tour of local communities across the country fights an exposition match against Buck Jarrico (Hal Baylor). When the prize money designated to refurbish the school goes missing, both the teacher, Ruth Stewart (Kathleen Case), and the gambler, Brad Forrester (Mark Dana), are falsely accused based on appearances.

On their 2017 album &quot;Life Is Good&quot;, the band Flogging Molly made reference to Sullivan on the track &#x27;The Hand of John L. Sullivan&#x27;.

<text>John Lawrence Sullivan (June 16, 1899 – August 8, 1982) was an American lawyer who served in several positions in the US federal government, including as Secretary of the Navy, the first during the administration of Harry S. Truman.

==Early life==
Sullivan was born in Manchester, New Hampshire on June 16, 1899. He was an alumnus of Dartmouth College. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1924.

==Career==
Sullivan served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1940–44, Assistant Secretary of the Navy (AIR) in 1945–46, notable as the first civilian sworn into Naval office aboard a ship in an active combat zone, and as Under Secretary of the Navy in 1946–47.
Sullivan was appointed Secretary of the Navy upon James Forrestal&#x27;s installation as Secretary of Defense. Sullivan&#x27;s major contributions to the Navy&#x27;s future directions include the advent of naval nuclear propulsion. In 1947, then-Captain Hyman G. Rickover went around his chain-of-command and directly to the Chief of Naval Operations, Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, by chance also a former submariner, to pitch his ideas for creating a nuclear-powered warship. Nimitz immediately understood the potential of nuclear propulsion and recommended the project to Sullivan, whose endorsement to build the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered vessel, , later caused Rickover to state that Sullivan was &quot;the true father of the Nuclear Navy.&quot;

In May 1949, Sullivan resigned in protest after the second Secretary of Defense, Louis A. Johnson, canceled the heavy aircraft carrier . This event was part of an interservice conflict known as the Revolt of the Admirals.

==Personal life==
Sullivan and his wife had two daughters and a son. Sullivan died on August 8, 1982. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

The house that Sullivan and his wife lived in, constructed in 1932–1933 in Manchester, New Hampshire, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in July 2023.

<text>is Wagyu beef from the Tajima strain of Japanese Black cattle, raised in Japan&#x27;s Hyōgo Prefecture around Kobe city, according to rules set out by the Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association. The meat is a delicacy, valued for its flavour, tenderness and fatty, well-marbled texture. Kobe beef can be prepared as steak, &quot;sukiyaki&quot;, &quot;shabu-shabu&quot;, &quot;sashimi&quot;, and &quot;teppanyaki&quot;. Within Japan, Kobe is one of the three &quot;Sandai Wagyū&quot;, the &quot;three big beefs&quot;, along with Matsusaka beef and Ōmi beef or Yonezawa beef.

Kobe beef is also called , &quot;Kōbe-gyū&quot; or in Japanese.

==History==
Cattle were brought to Japan from China in about the second century AD, in the Yayoi period. Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, they were used only as draught animals, in agriculture, forestry, mining and for transport, and as a source of fertiliser. Milk consumption was unknown, and – for cultural and religious reasons – meat was not eaten.

Japan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time.

Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, and 1887, some 2,600 foreign cattle were imported, including &quot;Braunvieh&quot;, Shorthorn and Devon. 

Between about 1900 and 1910, there was extensive cross-breeding of these with native stock. From 1919, the various heterogeneous regional populations that resulted from this brief period of cross-breeding were registered and selected as &quot;Improved Japanese Cattle&quot;. Four separate strains were characterised, based mainly on which type of foreign cattle had most influenced the hybrids, and were recognised as breeds in 1944. These were the four wagyū breeds, the Japanese Black, the Japanese Brown, the Japanese Polled and the Japanese Shorthorn. The Tajima is a strain of the Japanese Black, the most populous breed (around 90% of the four breeds).

Beef consumption remained low until after World War II. Kobe beef grew in popularity and extended its global reach in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1983, the Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association was formed to define and promote the Kobe trademark. It sets standards for animals to be labeled as Kobe beef.

In 2009, the USDA placed a ban on the import of all Japanese beef to prevent the Japan foot-and-mouth outbreak from reaching US shores. The ban was relaxed in August 2012 and thereafter Kobe beef was imported into the US.

==Industry==

Kobe beef in Japan is a registered trademark of the . It must fulfill all the following conditions:
* Tajima cattle born in Hyōgo Prefecture
* Farm feeding in Hyōgo Prefecture
* Heifer (a female that has not given birth) or bullock (steer or castrated bull)
* Processed at slaughterhouses in Kobe, Nishinomiya, Sanda, Kakogawa, or Himeji in Hyōgo Prefecture
* Marbling ratio, called BMS, of level 6 and above
* Meat quality score of 4 or 5, yield grade A or B
* Carcass weight of 499.9 kg or less.

The cattle are fed on grain fodder and brushed sometimes for setting fur. The melting point of fat of Kobe beef (Tajima cattle) is lower than common beef fat.

Kobe beef is expensive, partly because only about 3,000 head of cattle may qualify as Kobe per year. In Japan, all cattle, including those approved as Kobe beef, can be tracked via a 10-digit number through every step of their entire life cycle.

== Outside Japan ==

Kobe beef was not exported until 2012. It was exported in January 2012 to Macau, then to Hong Kong in July 2012. Since then, exports have also been made to the United States, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Canada.

In some countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, Wagyu cattle imported from Japan are farmed, either purebred or cross-bred with other beef breeds such as Aberdeen Angus. In some places meat from these cattle may be marketed under names such as &quot;Kobe-style beef&quot;; it is not Kobe beef, and does not fulfil the requirements for certification of the authentic Japanese product. Due to a lack of legal recognition of the Kobe beef trademark in the United States, it is also possible to sell this meat as &quot;Kobe beef&quot;. The Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association planned to publish pamphlets about Kobe beef in foreign languages.

American &quot;Kobe-style&quot; beef tends to be darker and stronger-tasting than the authentic product. It may have more appeal to Western palates unfamiliar with the mild taste and high fat content of true Kobe beef.

<text>The Sondheim Theatre (formerly the Queen&#x27;s Theatre) is a West End theatre located in Shaftesbury Avenue on the corner of Wardour Street in the City of Westminster, London. It opened as the Queen&#x27;s Theatre on 8 October 1907, as a twin to the neighbouring Hicks Theatre (now the Gielgud Theatre) which had opened ten months earlier. Both theatres were designed by W. G. R. Sprague. The theatre was Grade II listed by English Heritage in June 1972. 

In 2019 the theatre&#x27;s name was changed from the Queen&#x27;s to the Sondheim Theatre (after Stephen Sondheim) after a 20-week refurbishment. The theatre reopened on 18 December 2019.

== History ==
The original plan was to name the venue the &quot;Central Theatre&quot;. However, after lengthy debate, it was named the Queen&#x27;s Theatre and a portrait of Queen Alexandra was hung in the foyer.

The first production at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre was a comedy by Madeleine Lucette Ryley called &quot;The Sugar Bowl&quot;. Although it was poorly received and ran for only 36 performances, the theatre received glowing reviews. &quot;The Stage&quot; on 10 October 1907 described the theatre as:
In September 1940, a German bomb landed directly on the theatre, destroying the facade and lobby areas. The production at the time was Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot; starring Celia Johnson, Owen Nares and Margaret Rutherford. The theatre remained closed until, almost 20 years later, a £250,000 restoration was completed by Westwood Sons &amp; Partners. The auditorium retained its Edwardian decor, while the lobbies and exterior were rebuilt in a modern style. The reconstructed theatre opened on 8 July 1959 with John Gielgud&#x27;s solo performance in &quot;Shakespeare speeches and sonnets, Ages of Man&quot;.

From April 2004 to July 2019, the theatre played host to Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; which transferred after 18 years at the nearby Palace Theatre. The musical celebrated its 20th anniversary at the venue on 8 October 2005, and overtook &quot;Cats&quot; as the West End&#x27;s longest-running musical of all time a year later on 8 October 2006.

== 2019 Refurbishment ==
In 2019, Cameron Mackintosh announced that the original production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; would close on 13 July 2019 while the theatre underwent a £13.8 million restoration, but would return in a new production from 18 December 2019, when the Queen&#x27;s Theatre would be renamed as the Sondheim Theatre in honour of composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim.

The theatre was extensively refurbished during the 20-week period. The Edwardian auditorium was recreated from the 1950s reconstruction with the addition of a curved rail and new boxes at dress circle level, named after Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. Overhangs and ceilings on each tier were also redecorated with a recurring Sprague-inspired cherub design in carved plaster and &quot;fifteen colours and seven shades of gold&quot;. In total, approximately 70% of the plastering in the building was redone and a new, custom-made chandelier was hung.

The stage was lowered 30cm to be closer to the audience, and the famous revolving stage used in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; was also notably removed. 32 additional toilets were installed in a void space next door to the theatre. Additional space on every floor from the basement up was also reclaimed from a former electricity substation leased to the electric board in 1907. This allowed for more space on stage as well as additional dressing rooms on several floors, now fitted with showers. Finally, new seating was installed to improve audience comfort and sight-lines. 

Following completion, the Sondheim Theatre re-opened on 16 January 2020 for its first performance of &quot;Les Miserables&quot; in the 2009 touring staging.

<text>The Capricorn Coast is a stretch of coastline in Central Queensland, Australia and is part of the Shire of Livingstone (formerly part of Rockhampton Region).

== Geography ==
The Capricorn Coasts takes its name from Cape Capricorn () on Curtis Island, which in turn takes its name from the Tropic of Capricorn (approx ) which passes through roughly through the cape. The Tropic also passes through Capricorn Coast.

The Capricorn Coast is officially defined as &quot;the coastal area between the mouth of Water Park Creek and the mouth of the Fitzroy River&quot;, which establishes its boundaries as and , i.e. from Farnborough to Thompson Point. The Capricorn Coast is approximately from end to end yet comparatively small in population, with dozens of towns and islands scattered along its length. The region has a rich history going back to the 1850s.

The Capricorn Coast offers a wide variety of luxury and budget holiday accommodation as well as bush and rainforest retreats. Plentiful beaches and tourist venues provide snorkelling, island adventures, bushwalking and marina berths. A wildlife sanctuary is located at Cooberie and a crocodile farm at Coowonga.

==Governance==
In 1879, the Gogango Divisional Board was established as one of 74 divisions in Queensland under the &quot;Divisional Boards Act 1879&quot;. The Gogango Divisional Board&#x27;s scope of authority comprised a large area north and east of Rockhampton. While the Division was administered in Rockhampton, a locally appointed body, the Yeppoon Progress Association met once a month to look after the minor requirements of the town.

The discovery of gold brought a huge influx of people to the region, and the various Boards broke up into smaller administrative bodies to better service the growing population. In 1903, the Gogango Divisional Board was renamed Shire of Livingstone.

The boundaries of the new shire remained largely unchanged until 1984, when outlying districts including the suburbs of Nerimbera and Parkhurst were ceded to Livingstone&#x27;s larger neighbour, City of Rockhampton. Continued growth in both &quot;Local Government Authorities&quot; became a contentious subject from then on, which caused much political tension, until finally in 2007, the conflict gained new pace with the tabling before the Parliament of Queensland of the proposed &quot;Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007&quot;.

The Act passed, and on 15 March 2008, Livingstone Shire merged with Fitzroy Shire, Mount Morgan Shire, and City of Rockhampton to form the new LGA Rockhampton Region. This forced amalgamation caused political tension. In 2012, a proposal was made to de-amalgamate the Shire of Livingstone from the Rockhampton Region. On 9 March 2013, the citizens of the former Livingstone shire voted in a referendum to de-amalgamate. The Shire of Livingstone was re-established on 1 January 2014. Nerimbera was returned to the Shire of Livingstone but Parkhurst remains within the Rockhampton Region.

== Towns and localities ==
The following is a list of coastal towns and localities of the Capricorn Coast (from north to south):

* Farnborough including Bangalee
* Yeppoon
* Cooee Bay
* Lammermoor
* Rosslyn
* Mulambin
* Causeway Lake
* Kinka Beach
* Emu Park
* Zilzie
* Keppel Sands
* Joskeleigh
* Thompson Point

==Geography==
The Capricorn Coast features long sweeping beaches with shallow seas, dotted with rocky outcrops, the remnants of long-extinct volcanoes. The soil inland is red which is well suited to the many fruit crops growing in the area, while pockets of darker soils and clays are more suitable for grazing. In the north, the hills rise to form the Byfield Range which is home to stands of virgin rainforest.

Most of the population of the Capricorn Coast is centred in and around Yeppoon and Emu Park. The two towns are joined by the Scenic Highway which hugs a coastline dotted with coves and beaches and headlands. These headlands are the remnants of volcanic trachyte plugs and have allowed the formation of shallow beaches. The two towns are also linked by the Western Yeppoon-Emu Park Road (also called Tanby Road South), which is a newer inland route developed to keep up with the Capricorn Coast&#x27;s rapid growth.

Further south, separated by the broad mouth of Coorooman Creek, lies Keppel Sands. While the township is small having a population of 318 in 2006, its relative isolation makes Keppel Sands a significant community centre for people living in the surrounding rural areas of Joskeleigh, Coowonga, Tungamull, and Cawarral.

Directly offshore and visible from most seaside towns on the Capricorn Coast is the popular tourist destination, Great Keppel Island. Dozens of smaller islands and atolls also dot the coastline.

===Sub-regions===
Due to the size of the Capricorn Coast, its geography and demographics are diverse, however the region has four distinct sections within it.
* Northern – From Stanage Bay to Bungundarra; very low population, areas of wetlands, rainforests, and large swathes of protected areas;
* Central – South of Bungundarra to Zilzie; major population areas, beaches, urban, and semi-rural;
* Southern – South and inland from Zilzie to the Fitzroy River; low population, beaches, tidal flats, rural, village-type communities;
* Offshore – Islands beyond the mainland coves in Keppel and Shoalwater Bays; very low population, tourist and conservation areas.

===Northern section===

Towns, suburbs, and localities in the northern section of the Capricorn Coast are: Barmaryee, Byfield, Byfield National Park, Cooberie, Corio Bay, Farnborough, Five Rocks, Inverness, Red Rock Forest, Shoalwater Bay, Stanage Bay, Stockyard, Upper Stoney Creek, Waterpark Creek.

Just north of Yeppoon, the geography subtly begins to change. Beyond the beaches and bays, flat pastures give way to rolling hillocks, mountains, ranges and the streams of the Byfield township and Byfield National Park.

Red Rock, Waterpark Creek, and Upper Stoney Creek are popular camping grounds. Byfield also features Fern&#x27;s Hideaway, a holiday retreat and restaurant set on the forested banks of Waterpark Creek. On the coast, sweeping beaches interspersed with coral cays back onto the world-heritage Iwasaki and Shoalwater Wetlands. Regardless of the risks, Stockyard, Corbett&#x27;s Landing, and Sandfly Creek are popular fishing locations. 

Further north, and despite its remoteness, Five Rocks is a popular camping and 4WD destinations. Beyond are the pristine wilderness areas of Shoalwater Bay, Townshend Island, and Stanage.

===Central section===

Towns, suburbs, and localities in the central section of the Capricorn Coast are: Adelaide Park, Bangalee, Barlows Hill, Bluff Rock, Capricorn Coast National Park, Causeway Lake, Cooee Bay, Creek Rock, Emu Park, Kemp Beach, Keppel Bay Estate, Kinka Beach, Lammermoor, Meikleville Hill, Mulambin, Mulambin Waters, Ocean View, Pacific Heights, Rosslyn, Statue Bay, Taranganba, Yeppoon, Wreck Point, Zilzie.

Forty kilometres of long beaches and shallow coves grace the Central Capricorn Coast from Farnborough in the north to Zilzie in the south. Dotted along the way are a dozen seaside communities, and the major towns of Yeppoon and Emu Park. Clearly visible from every beach along the way is Great Keppel Island, thirty minutes away by boat.

Yeppoon and Emu Park are connected by the Scenic Highway. Adjoining Yeppoon to the south are the seaside communities of Cooee Bay and Taranganba, and then the tourist beach, Lammermoor, popular for its clean sands and beach rock formations. Continuing on southward is the fishing beach, Statue Bay, and then the Keppel Bay Marina, a 400 berth marina at Rosslyn Bay. Around the corner, the long stretch of shallow coves continue; Kemp Beach with Bluff Rock just a ten-minute kayak offshore, and then the picturesque Mulambin Beach. A few minutes further is Causeway Lake with hire boats and stores. Across the bridge, is Kinka Beach, and then Emu Park and Zilzie.

===Southern section===

Towns, suburbs, and localities in the southern section of the Capricorn Coast are Coowonga, Girt Island, Joskeleigh, Keppel Sands, Long Beach (or Joskeleigh Beach), Quartz Rock, Thompson&#x27;s Point.

Often referred to as the &quot;forgotten&quot; end of the Capricorn Coast, the rural and seaside communities south of the major population centres have two principal commons; they are centred on the life-giving waterways in the area, such as Coorooman Creek and the Fitzroy River.

Fishing and boating are popular pursuits, with community festivals well frequented, and local support groups such as the Rural Fire Brigade well attended.

===Offshore islands===
Islands, atolls, and localities in the bays of the Capricorn Coast are: Arch Rock, Conical Rocks, Corroberee Island, Entrance Rocks, Flat Rock, Great Keppel Island, Half Tide Rocks, Keppel Bay Islands National Park including Pelican Island, Divided Island, Conical Island, Halfway Island, Humpy Island, Miall Island, North Keppel Island, Middle Island, Peak Island, Man and Wife Rocks, Mother Macgregor Island, Outer Rocks, Pelican Rock, Pumpkin Island, Round Rock, Sloping Island, Split Rock, Square Rocks, Wedge Island.

==Climate==
The Capricorn Coast experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa/Cwa&quot;).

Due to its location in the southern tropics, the Capricorn Coast experiences hot summers without the extreme humidity of Far North Queensland, and mild winters without the freezing temperatures of the south. The year round temperate climate lends itself well to a relaxed lifestyle, which has proven popular with new families moving to the Capricorn Coast on the back of the mining boom.

==History==
===Indigenous history===

The Capricorn Coast and indeed the area that comprises most of the Rockhampton Region is the traditional land of the Darumbal Aboriginal peoples. Offshore, the Keppel Bay Islands National Park is home to the Kanomi-Woppaburra people (The Keppel Islanders).

On the coast, alliances existed between tribes, and clans within tribes. The Kuinmurrburra nation had six allied tribes within it; the Kutuburra, Ristebura, Wanuburra, Wuruburra, Pukanburra, and Muinburra, which existed in relative harmony to allow for nature&#x27;s swinging moods. The island natives did not interact with the mainland Darumbals, for they feared each other and spoke a much different dialect. With the settlement of Yeppoon in the late 1860s, the principal landholder on the Capricorn Coast, Robert Ross, removed the Kanomi population from North Keppel because they were disturbing his cattle.

The last of the Keppel Islanders were forcibly removed by the Queensland Government in 1912. The Darumbal Dreamtime Centre in Rockhampton, adjacent to the Yeppoon turnoff, is the largest Aboriginal cultural centre in Australia.

===European settlement===
====Discovery and exploration====
The Capricorn Coast was first explored by James Cook in 1770. He did not make landing in the area however he named several islands and land forms; Cape Capricorn, Keppel Isles, Keppel Bay, Cape Many Fold (later Cape Manifold), and Shoal Water Bay (later Shoalwater Bay).

Matthew Flinders explored the Capricorn Coast in great detail in 1804. Flinders spent the best part of a month in the shallow bays, making landings at Curtis Island, Port Clinton, Shoalwater Bay and Percy Island. Matthew Flinders Drive, a scenic cliffside road that winds through Cooee Bay and up over the top of Wreck Point, is named in his honour.

Phillip Parker King followed in 1820 but encountered difficulties when his ship, the Mermaid, ran aground. In 1843, an extensive survey was carried out by Captain Francis Price Blackwood on HMS Fly and Captain Charles Yule who commanded HMS Bramble.

In 1844 and 1846, Ludwig Leichhardt and Thomas Mitchell explored what would later become Rockhampton, noting the quality of grazing lands in the district.

In 1853, brothers William and Charles Archer followed in the footsteps of Leichhardt and Mitchell. They settled in Gracemere, twelve kilometres west of the present day City of Rockhampton. By 1858, the town of Rockhampton was officially proclaimed, and settlement began in earnest.

====Settlement====
In 1867, the town reserve was surveyed then proclaimed as suitable for settlement. The Government Surveyor reported the site as &quot;&quot;Yapoon&quot;, a spot northward of Emu Park about nine miles, was most suitable as a watering place.&quot; The name, especially given its definition, is believed to have come from the Darumbal people, the indigenous tribe local to the region. Indeed, on the western fringe of Rockhampton, an expansive wetlands system was named Yeppen-Yeppen Lagoon. On that basis, the etymology of the two districts is believed to be the same.

Initial settlement was slow however. Though intended to become a township, the region&#x27;s rich soils attracted farmers rather than townspeople. This changed the following year with the commencement of regular stagecoach services from Rockhampton, and the continued mining of copper and gold in the coastal hinterlands around Cawarral and Mount Chalmers.

By 1889, the town was growing steadily, and boasted several hotels and boarding houses, a sugar mill, a telegraph service, a Methodist-Presbyterian church, and Yeppoon&#x27;s first state school which is today a heritage listed building.
With primary production the lifeblood of the town, better transportation was needed, not only to Rockhampton but along the coast as well.

Steam wagons followed and the north of Yeppoon opened up to new commerce and communities. Pastoral Lands and settlements now filled the landscape from Woodbury and Byfield in the north, inland through Bungundarra, Lake Mary, Tanby, Mount Chalmers, and Cawarral. South of Yeppoon, all arable lands through Taranganba, Lammermoor, and Mulambin were also claimed as far as to present day Causeway Lake.

South of the lake, progress was also running full steam. The new town of Emu Park was taking form with the completion of the first coastal railway from Rockhampton in 1889. Even at this early stage of Capricorn Coast history, Emu Park and Yeppoon shared an odd rivalry, with Emu Park attracting the more elite section of Rockhampton and Mount Morgan society, while the &quot;common man&quot;, especially gold miners from Cawarral and Mount Chalmers gravitated towards Yeppoon. 

With Emu Park separated from Yeppoon by the expansive Causeway Lake and the shifting dunes of Kinka, that sense of separateness between the two seaside towns continued for another fifty years until a permanent tide-proof causeway was finally constructed to join the two ends of the coast.

That separate history however, allowed Emu Park and Yeppoon to develop distinct personalities that are still apparent today.
The rail line also made access easier to Keppel Sands, at least for half of the journey, with a siding located at Tungamull. From there, the fifteen kilometre trek to Sand Hills as the township was then named, was fraught with peril, not least of which was the permanent wetlands that effectively made the town an island. Monsoonal rains could isolate Keppel Sands for several weeks.

It was because of this inaccessibility that Keppel Sands failed to grow at the same pace as its sister towns across Coorooman Creek, but nonetheless a pioneering spirit from local residents saw the township prevail. In 1893, the Sand Hills State School opened.

To the present day, Joskeleigh remains a testament to times that many white Australians might prefer to forget, as it is home to one of Australia&#x27;s most prominent South Sea Island communities; descendants of peoples blackbirded from their native homes to work as indentured labourers in the sugar and tobacco plantations of the day.

====The railway====
From the time of its inception, Emu Park was the hedonistic playground of the Rockhampton social set and well-heeled gold miners from Mount Morgan, who used their considerable influence to lobby the Queensland Government for a rail link to the fledgling seaside town. In late 1888, they achieved their ambitions and the Rockhampton-Emu Park railway line was opened, making the journey far less arduous. New communities sprouted up along the path of the railway, and new stations and sidings were established at Nerimbera, Nankin, Sleipner, Tungamull, Coowonga, Coorooman, and Tanby.
In 1908, a branch line was opened at Sleipner Junction to service the gold towns of Mount Chalmers and Cawarral, and in 1909 the branch line reached Yeppoon.

During the 1960s, the Emu Park rail line was progressively decommissioned, however the original building at Nankin still stands. At Tungamull directly before the Keppel Sands Road turnoff, pylons that supported the rail bridge are also clearly visible beside the floodway crossing. The Emu Park Museum also houses many historical relics of the rail line that helped make the remote southern communities of the Capricorn Coast more accessible to the public.

Passenger trains ceased running to Mount Chalmers, Cawarral, and Yeppoon in 2000 with the advent much-improved roads to Rockhampton. Viability of the line was further limited due to downsizing of local pineapple production, and an increased use of road freight. In 2004, the trains stopped running and over the next four years the tracks were removed. In 2008, the Yeppoon Railway Station was placed on the permanent heritage register by the Queensland Heritage Council. It is one of the very few railway terminal stations remaining on the Queensland coast, and the building is still in excellent condition.

In 2012, dialogue began between community groups and Rockhampton Regional Council to convert the track formerly occupied by the Yeppoon line into a cycling and hiking trail.

====Yeppoon Sugar Company====
The history of the sugar industry on the Capricorn Coast was a short one, commencing in 1883 and ending twenty years later, but its effects still linger today. 

The Yeppoon Sugar Company was the brainchild of William Broome who had property a few kilometres north of Yeppoon. Needing investors, he floated the company in 1883, and a crushing mill was subsequently built at Farnborough. The mill relied on other people to do the growing, but sugar was a premium commodity of the day, and landowners followed Broome&#x27;s lead. Soon there were sugar cane plantations at Farnborough, Cawarral, and Joskeleigh.

Broome&#x27;s vision collapsed in 1883 due largely to late summer rains. The banks foreclosed, and the business was taken over by the company&#x27;s Rockhampton backers. They auctioned it promptly at a significant loss to two of the mill&#x27;s former shareholders. Rutherford Armstrong took the reins of the new venture, renamed the Farnborough Sugar Plantation. He trebled production and several good seasons followed.

In 1896, twenty properties were growing cane at a rate of 21 tons per acre, which was considered good for the industry. However the Depression combined with a low world sugar price and changes to the Pacific Islanders Protection Act, brought the mill to its knees once more. It finally closed its doors in 1903. 

As late at 1911, attempts were made by various parties to resurrect the sugar industry with proposals for central mills at Rockhampton and Yeppoon, however people&#x27;s memories were long, and financier&#x27;s did not come forth. With no financial guarantorship for a local industry, the Sugar Commission concentrated on building mills in the north of the state, where arguably the climate is more suited to sugar cane.

====Plight of the Kanakas====
In the aftermath of the failed Yeppoon sugar industry, the indentured labourers who had worked the cane fields found themselves facing new fears. Freed from service, they were not free in the eyes of the state. Some of the Islanders had been in Australia for decades, and during that time, their rights had dwindled away.

Plantation owners on the Capricorn Coast were not unique in sourcing South Sea Islanders for indentured labour. Indeed, it was the norm, and Yeppoon had a better track record than most, providing adequate food and shelter for the workers, even if they were substantially underpaid. The issue, however was not so much the conditions of employment, as the manner in which the labour was procured. 

The idea of using Pacific Islanders in the cane fields was not a random act. Some Islanders had come willingly as early as 1847, and landholders viewed them as more intelligent and better suited to the task than Chinese or Indian labourers. With Queensland&#x27;s rapid growth however, demand began to outstrip supply, so enterprising ship owners developed new methods for sourcing workers from the Pacific. 

From 1863 to 1904, over 62,000 South Sea Islanders were &#x27;blackbirded&#x27; to serve as cheap or free labour on Queensland&#x27;s vast agricultural holdings. Blackbirding meant the recruitment of people through manipulation or simply kidnapping. Essentially it was enslavement. In some instances, entire villages were taken onto ships to work the sugar fields. Conditions aboard ship were notoriously poor with little sanitation or food, and frequent brutality. Many islanders died during their voyages to Australia.
The Queensland Government made some attempts to limit the effects of the practice, notably the &quot;Polynesian Labourers Act 1868&quot;, but the provisions were frequently evaded by unscrupulous ship owners who were paid per head of cargo. The British Navy also patrolled for blackbirding ships, but with little effect. In Queensland, the government faced an uncomfortably quandary; Slavery was illegal but the state needed cheap labour. Hence, in 1880, the British Government implemented the &quot;Pacific Islanders&#x27; Protection Act 1880&quot; which outlined the minimum standards for importing &quot;indentured labourers&quot;. The Act may or may not have helped improve standards aboard ship, as its principal purpose was to license operators and their human cargo.

Later revisions of the Act focused on making it more difficult for the trade to continue rather than the plight of the Islanders themselves. In 1890, the Act was amended for the third time so that no more licences would be issued, however plummeting profits in the sugar industry saw the amendment retracted so the trade in cheap labour could continue. Finally in 1901, the Pacific Island Labourers&#x27; Act 1901 was passed. Its purpose was to deport the vast majority of Pacific Islanders working in Australia. A week earlier, the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 was also passed.

Combined, the two Acts prohibited Pacific Islanders from entering the country after 1904, and those who had arrived beforehand had to be licensed. The Acts also provided that from 1906, any Pacific Islander still in Australia could be instantly deported. Further it was illegal to work for pay, which meant that anyone who slipped through the net would not have the means to provide for themselves.

Around ten thousand Islanders were deported, many to the wrong islands. Others however, managed to stay on technicalities. Islanders who had lived in Australia for twenty years were classified as Australian citizens, as were any children born since their arrival. Many whites were sympathetic to the Islanders&#x27; plight. In Farnborough, Robert Armstrong, the former manager of the mill, gave employment to some of his former workers to tend his farms, and in the south, Paul Joske and other landholders leased them blocks to grow crops and raise their families. Many Islanders moved onto these blocks, and after Joske&#x27;s death, the area was renamed Joskeleigh.

The Islanders formed a close-knit community there. They lived in traditional thatched huts and survived by growing vegetables and selling them. Conditions improved, and in 1913, a school was opened in Joskeleigh. The old headmaster&#x27;s house in now the Joskeleigh Museum, and around thirty Islander families still live in the community. There is also a substantial Islander community in North Rockhampton and throughout the Capricorn Coast.

The term &quot;Kanaka&quot; (from the French &quot;Canaque&quot;, and Hawaiian &quot;Kanak&quot; meaning man), perhaps once derogatory is nowadays worn as a badge of honour. Perhaps for their tenacity and perseverance, the Australian South Sea Islanders achieved an untouchable status, which unfortunately was not afforded to the native Aboriginals of the time. While some Islanders and Aborigines inter-bred at Joskeleigh, the last of the indigenous Darumbals living there were removed by the State in 1930.

As an interesting point of closure to the history of the mill, the manager of Farnborough Sugar Plantation, Rutherford Armstrong, died in 1958 at age 97. In accordance with his expressed wish, his ashes were scattered on the old mill site.

===Recent history===
====World War II====
During World War 2, around 30,000 US Soldiers were stationed on the Capricorn Coast, most notably at Thompson&#x27;s Point where efforts by the Capricorn Coast Historical Society are underway to ensure the survival of this piece of history. At nearby Nerimbera is St Christopher&#x27;s Chapel which was built by US Soldiers during the war, and has been restored to its original condition. 

====Shoalwater Bay====
With Australia&#x27;s entry into the Vietnam War, the Australian Army took control of Shoalwater Bay, Townshend Island, and a large tract abutting Byfield for use as a military training facility. This area was named the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area. In 1966, the last civilians vacated their holdings there. While the &quot;military invasion&quot; of the pristine wilderness area was unpopular with many, some humanitarian observers saw the eviction of white landowners as ironic justice for their ancestors&#x27; eviction of the Aboriginal population a century before.

====Iwasaki resort====
In 1971, a Japanese syndicate headed by Yohachiro Iwasaki acquired hundreds of thousands of hectares of beachfront land including wetlands in Farnborough to build a resort. The acquisition caused widespread outrage, given that Australian citizens and developers had been refused to buy the land on several occasions prior, and also due to the belief that the deal was corrupted by kickbacks at the Queensland Government level.

Anti-Japanese sentiment ran rife including the printing of fake money featuring Mr Iwasaki&#x27;s caricatured face with a currency value of 4 Grabs, a play on the term &quot;up for grabs&quot;. When construction began, the Yeppoon RSL club posted an anti-Japanese display on their lawns. Local discontent reached its climax on 29 November 1980, the day of the Queensland Election, when a bomb was set off at Iwasaki Resort. Two men were charged but acquitted.

The project continued regardless. Originally known as the Iwasaki Resort, it later became the Capricorn International Resort. Rydges managed the resort until 2011, when the lease was taken over by Mercure.

Closed in 2016, the resort currently only operates one of its two golf courses. A skeleton admin staff are still in place, however all accommodation and resort facilities are unavailable to the public.

Looking for redevelopment approval, a draft EIS being prepared by proponent for a:

* 300-room, five-star resort, including a golf course
* caravan and recreational vehicle park
* Wagyu cattle farm - for farm stays, cattle and sheep farming and educational activities
* residential community of 8000 dwellings and village centre
* conservation precinct 
* airstrip - for tourism, charter flights and a potential fly-in, fly-out hub
* refurbishment of the existing 331-room Mercure Capricorn Resort (independent of EIS process).

The redevelopment is expected to create 8500 during the construction phase over approximately 20 years and 2160 when operational.

==Facilities and infrastructure==
One marked distinction from other regions along the tropical Queensland coast is that the Capricorn Coast community is more focused on quality of lifestyle rather than tourism.

The impact of mining aside, the economy and industry of the Capricorn Coast is diverse, ranging from crops, fishing, and grazing to manufacturing and resources. 

Notably, on the northern fringe of the Capricorn Coast, at Shoalwater Bay is managed and utilised by the Australian Army for military training. The Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area (SBMTA) frequently sees deployments of in excess of 30,000 troops, plus annual training exercises with the Singapore Armed Forces and bi-annual Talisman Sabre exercises with the US Military.

In addition, many of the islands along the coast are used for scientific research in marine biology as well as environmental studies. These fields of research bring people from all around the world. 

===Health services===

The Capricorn Coast is currently served by local general practices, Capricorn Coast Hospital (formerly Yeppoon Hospital) and Mater Yeppoon.

The Capricorn Coast Hospital is Located on 8 Hoskyn Drive Yeppoon QLD 4703. The Capricorn Coast Is also Accompanied by Capricorn Coast Community Dental Clinic.

Child and Adolescent Oral Health Service and Yeppoon Alcohol and Other Drugs Services.
===Emergency and disaster response===
Capricorn Coast is well supported by a number of emergency services groups and government agencies. The Coastguard has three bases on the Capricorn Coast at Keppel Sands, Yeppoon, and Stanage Bay (Thirsty Sound). The Capricorn Helicopter Rescue is based in Rockhampton and has an operational range extending from Maryborough to Mackay. The Queensland Ambulance Service has staffed stations in Emu Park and Yeppoon.

The Queensland Police Service have stations that service the Capricorn Coast at Emu Park, Yeppoon, and Lakes Creek (suburb of North Rockhampton). Queensland Fire and Rescue has permanently staffed stations in Emu Park and Yeppoon. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is based at Rockhampton Airport and services all of Central Queensland.

The Rural Fire Service has Wardens based in Adelaide Park, Barmoya, Bondoola, Bowenia, Bungundarra, Byfield, Canal Creek, Cawarral, Cooberie, Coowonga, Emu Park, Great Keppel Island, Hidden Valley, Keppel Sands, Maryvale, Nankin, Nerimbera, Stockyard Point, Tanby, Woodbury, Yeppoon. The State Emergency Service responds in time of emergency and disaster. The SES has groups based in Emu Park, Great Keppel Island, Keppel Sands, Yeppoon, and Stanage. Yeppoon Water Police is based at Rosslyn Bay. They patrol Keppel Bay and respond to emergencies in the region.

===Education===
Capricorn Coast has abundant primary and secondary schools, both private and public.

==Environment==
===Environmental protests and concerns===
* 1994 Shoalwater Bay: Shoalwater Bay was the site for a conservation battle over sand mining in near-pristine wilderness, which was won by environmentalists, including Peter Garrett. The federal government followed an inquiry&#x27;s finding against the proposal and blocked the development in September 1994.
* 2009 Shoalwater Bay: In June and July 2009, organised protests began throughout Queensland against the Talisman Saber exercises to be conducted at Shoalwater Bay.
* 2011 Shoalwater Bay: In 2011, three protesters were charged for trespassing in the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area, while another man attacked a Tiger helicopter at Rockhampton Airport with an axe.
*2011 Balaclava Island: The proposed coal terminal on &quot;Balaclava Island&quot; and subsequent dredging near the mouth of the Fitzroy River is causing new concerns for conservation groups for fear of its effects on marine life and the health of the Great Barrier Reef.

==Tourism and activities==
After a ten-year downturn in tourism the Capricorn Coast has seen a number of its large resorts close. Although, there are still many other accommodation options to choose from. A recent foreshore redevelopment maybe the saving grace of what&#x27;s been a serious struggle to attract tourists to the coast. The recently constructed Yeppoon Lagoon is a Bali style pool, includes a shallow children&#x27;s play area, an informal lap swimming area and a swim-up infinity edge with panoramic views. Free for public use, it features day facilities including BBQ&#x27;s.

A short walk north along the main beach foreshore sits the Keppel Kracken. Keppel Kraken is a free to access water play feature on the Yeppoon foreshore. With sea creature sculptures adorning the zero depth wet area and set against the spectacular backdrop of Keppel Bay. Featuring a host of interactive elements including water cannons, jets and an umbrella bucket, the Keppel Kraken is heaps of fun for families with young kids.

In the heart of Yeppoon is Bayview Towers.

At the southern end of the Capricorn Coast is Zilzie Bay Great Barrier Reef Resort, a sprawling complex located south of Emu Park (closed as at 2016). Boasting a waterless golf course, provided no accommodation in its first stage. Recent new report have suggested that a Chinese investor has purchased the building, golf course and surrounding land.

Central to the Capricorn Coast and the 27 islands offshore is Keppel Bay Marina at Rosslyn Bay, a popular port of call for &quot;yachties&quot; with 400 floating marina berths catering for vessels up to 35 metres in length. Rosslyn Bay also offers fine dining, maintained parklands, and short-and-longterm accommodation.

The main resort on Great Keppel Island has been closed for ten years, and has been long awaiting redevelopment. Currently the old resort shell is being demolished and taken away as per the lease conditions because the 162-hectare land holding has been listed for sale. The adjoining 600-hectare land on the island has environmental approvals for freehold villas.

Alternative accommodation and camping is still available. Fast-Cats depart regularly from Rosslyn Bay, and day-trippers are welcome on the island.

At the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, beyond the traditional scope of the region are Heron Island and Lady Elliot Island, which provide snorkelling and diving opportunities and are accessible from Gladstone. Lady Musgrave Island is uninhabited but overnight camping is permitted.

The community based tourism website Yeppoon, Capricorn Coast, features all the Capricorn Coast has to offer and is growing every day. After a ten-year downturn in tourism the town was lacking the publicity needed to get the coast back on the map for travellers. After a public scolding on social media from those disappointed by a lack of support the tax/ratepayer funded local tourism body offered coastal businesses (by only focusing on paid members) a small group of community members took matters into their own hands and created a comprehensive site about the coast. The site also has a growing social media presence (Facebook &amp; Instagram).

<text>Deborah Warner (born 12 May 1959) is a British director of theatre and opera, known for her interpretations of the works of Shakespeare, Bertolt Brecht, Benjamin Britten, and Henrik Ibsen, and for her collaborations with Irish actress Fiona Shaw.

==Early life and education==
Warner was born on 12 May 1959 in Oxford, England, to antiquarians Roger Harold Metford Warner and Ruth Ernestine Hurcombe. 

After attending Sidcot School and St Clare&#x27;s, Oxford, she studied Stage Management at Central School of Speech and Drama. 

In 1980 she founded the KICK theatre company when she was 21.

==Career==

Warner has since the 1980s worked in close creative partnership with the actor Fiona Shaw, developing a wide range of projects that have been seen throughout Europe and the United States. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;″ critic John Peter wrote of their vision of &quot;Richard II&quot; that &quot;Warner and Shaw are not being either fashionable or reactionary ... They are making theatre that is an adventure, a journey of the mind, a discovery of other ages, other countries, other people, other minds.&quot; Warner has also enjoyed long-term collaborations with the designers , Hildegard Bechtler, , Tom Pye, the composer and the choreographer Kim Brandstrup.

Although the majority of her work has focused on major classics of spoken drama and opera, she has also experimented with the performance of poetry (&quot;The Waste Land&quot;, &quot;Readings&quot;) and the staging of oratorios (&quot;St John Passion&quot;, &quot;Messiah&quot;), as well as installations (&quot;The St Pancras and Angel projects, Peace Camp&quot;). She has made relatively few excursions into new work (Jeanette Winterson&#x27;s &quot;The Powerbook&quot; (2002), Tansy Davies&#x27; 2015 opera &quot;Between Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Testament of Mary&quot; being exceptions) or comedy (&quot;The School for Scandal&quot;), and although she has made much creative use of video on stage, she has directed little for film and television.

Her first creations for Kick, a company that she started and managed, were deeply influenced by the example of Peter Brook and his belief that the performer must always be at the centre of the event. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I would have been in any way conscious of the potency of theatre if I hadn&#x27;t seen his work&quot;, she said in an interview with &quot;Vogue&quot; in July 1994. Other figures important in her formative years include Peter Stein, who commissioned her production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; at the Salzburg Festival, and Nicholas Payne and Anthony Whitworth-Jones who commissioned her first essays in opera, at Opera North and Glyndebourne respectively.

Although she has refused to subscribe to a programmatic feminism or a political ideology, her work has often explored issues of gender, notably in her ground-breaking casting of Fiona Shaw as Shakespeare&#x27;s Richard II. She was also the first woman director to be given sole charge of a production in the main house of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.

===Theatre===
In 1987 Warner joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where she directed &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and where she also began her long-time collaboration with Fiona Shaw. Warner and Shaw have collaborated on many plays, including &quot;Electra&quot; (RSC); &quot;The Good Person of Sezuan&quot; (1989, National Theatre); &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (1991, The Abbey Theatre and BBC2); the controversial &quot;Richard II&quot;, with Shaw in the title role, also at the National Theatre (1995) and televised by BBC2; &quot;Footfalls&quot;, whose radical staging so enraged the Beckett estate that the production was pulled during its run; &quot;The PowerBook&quot;, at the National Theatre, a dramatisation of Jeanette Winterson&#x27;s novel; &quot;Medea&quot; (2000–2001, Queen&#x27;s Theatre and Broadway); and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, in which Shaw played the small part of Portia. The production starred Ralph Fiennes and Simon Russell Beale; first staged at the Barbican Centre, it later toured Europe.

Shaw and Warner toured the world with T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, which began in Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall in London&#x27;s East End. Her work began to focus on the link of drama to places, a theme which was expanded upon in her Angel Project.

In 2007, following negotiations with the Beckett estate, Warner directed Shaw in &quot;Happy Days&quot; at the National Theatre, which toured internationally including at the ancient amphitheatre at Epidaurus in Greece and Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, followed in 2009 by &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; (with Shaw in the title role) at the Olivier Theatre at the National.

She returned to the Barbican Centre in 2011 to direct &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;.

===Opera and classical music===
Warner has also worked extensively in field of opera and classical music, including a production of &quot;The Diary of One Who Disappeared&quot; by Janáček starring Ian Bostridge; a staging of the &quot;St John Passion&quot; at English National Opera; a controversial staging of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at Glyndebourne; &quot;Wozzeck&quot; for Opera North; &quot;Death in Venice&quot; and Tansy Davies&#x27; &quot;Between Worlds&quot; at English National Opera; and Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; with Les Arts Florissants in Vienna, Paris, and Amsterdam.

Other notable productions include opening the 2015/15 season at La Scala, Milan, with &quot;Fidelio&quot; conducted by Daniel Barenboim and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in the 2013/2014 season.

She frequently collaborates with Canadian set designer Michael Levine.

Warner directed the 1999 film &quot;The Last September&quot;, starring Michael Gambon and Maggie Smith.

<doc id="819051" wikidata="Q1536234" url="?curid=819051" title="Gold's Gym">
<text>Gold&#x27;s Gym International, Inc. is an American chain of international fitness centers (commonly referred to as gyms) originally started by Joe Gold in Venice Beach, California. Each gym offers a variety of cardio and strength training equipment as well as group exercise programs. Gold&#x27;s Gym&#x27;s has its headquarters in Dallas and is now owned by RSG Group.

== History ==
Joe Gold opened the first Gold&#x27;s Gym in August 1965, in Venice Beach, California, long before the modern-day health club existed. Featuring homemade equipment and dubbed &quot;the Mecca of bodybuilding&quot;, it was frequented by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dave Draper.

=== Early developments ===
In the 1950s, bodybuilding was seen as an anti-social outsider sport dominated by outcasts.
Gyms in California, the early home of bodybuilding, were usually set up outdoors. An indoor gym had operated in Santa Monica, but it was shut down by the city in 1959 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Bodybuilder Joe Gold was dissatisfied with ad hoc gyms, and in 1965, he converted a building he owned on Pacific Avenue in Venice Beach into the first Gold&#x27;s Gym. Many bodybuilders soon became enthusiastic clients. Dick Tyler commented it as &quot;big news for big men&quot;, a location that would become synonymous with the rise of legendary bodybuilders like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dave Draper, Lou Ferrigno, or Franco Columbo. However, despite the spirited reception and Gold&#x27;s money-saving measures, such as building his own exercise equipment, monthly membership fees proved insufficient to maintain the business. A veteran of the merchant marine, Gold wanted to go back to sea, and in 1970, he sold the business to antique dealer Dave Saxe and jeweler Bud Danits for $50,000 (). Saxe and Danits were also unable to operate the gym profitably and considered converting it into an antique shop. Instead, gym member Ken Sprague seized the opportunity and purchased the gym in late 1971. Having a background in the film industry, he injected new energy into the business by organizing bodybuilding competitions and shows to exhibit Gold&#x27;s Gym athletes. Finally, Gold&#x27;s Gym became profitable.

=== The logo ===
The original Gold&#x27;s Gym logo, a bald weightlifter holding a barbell, was designed in 1973 by professional wrestler Ric Drasin, who was Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s training partner for four years. During a training break, he sketched the weightlifter on a napkin. The logo became an iconic symbol within the bodybuilding scene.

=== Gold&#x27;s Gym as film set for &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; ===
Due to Sprague&#x27;s contacts in the film industry and his persuasion skills, an opportunity arose in 1975, when the filmmaker George Butler set out to film the groundbreaking docudrama Pumping Iron (1977), with Gold&#x27;s Gym as the primary filming location. Sprague, having strong commitments to his gym and the sport as well as understanding the requirements for film, offered Butler full and unrestricted access to the gym. Preparing and improving the gym as a film set, he also had certain windows painted over to control backlight and installed a lightening grid. Even though the filmmakers ran out of funds to finish the production, Arnold Schwarzenegger and other bodybuilders helped to raise additional funds for its completion. The docudrama Pumping Iron became a best seller, which brought attention not only to the gym itself but also to bodybuilding and physique in general. Due to that impact, Gold&#x27;s Gym became the most famous gym worldwide, which more than tripled the membership prices. Gold&#x27;s Gym continued to be considered a landmark in bodybuilding culture and has achieved cult status.

=== Transition to an international franchise ===
In 1979 Gold&#x27;s Gym was sold by Sprague to the trio Ed Connors, Pete Grymkowski (former Mr. World), and Tim Kimber. It was the most famous gym in the world at that time. After two years of ownership, they moved from the 5500-square-foot facility into a 60,000-square-foot building over a six-year period. The three owners extended Gold&#x27;s Gym to the franchise system and made licensing out deals all over the USA. Gold&#x27;s Gym was one of the first companies in the health and fitness industry to franchise, starting in 1980. Using the momentum of its fame it sold licenses for products such as fitness equipment and clothing. Soon the brand expanded internationally, after the first outside USA opening in Canada 1985. In 1993 the limit of 1 million members was exceeded. During the nineties Gold&#x27;s Gym expanded around the globe, even in Japan and Russia. Due to the international franchise, the original character changed subsequently to a modern commercial gym fulfilling the standards of the modern fitness industry. In 1999 the company was sold to the private firm Brockway Moran &amp; Partners for an estimated $50 million. It was sold again in 2004 to TRT Holdings for $150 million.
The growth of Gold&#x27;s Gym continued expanding the business with modern wellness programs that grew to more than 3000 company partners. The original Gold&#x27;s Gym in Venice Beach is considered a national sports landmark by ESPN and is named on its list of the 100 most important sports venues. Notable users of Gold&#x27;s Gym have included such celebrities as Jessica Alba, Jodie Foster, Morgan Freeman, Dwayne Johnson, Jim Morrison, Keanu Reeves, Hilary Swank, Big Show, and Tiger Woods, and many others. In 2016 Gold&#x27;s Gym opened 58 new locations across the world and in 2017 its first locations in Amman in Jordan.

=== New ownership by RSG Group ===
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic heavily affected the company, forcing it to file bankruptcy with its 61 company-owned gyms and over 700 franchises across six continents. On May 4, 2020, GGI Holdings, LLC (Gold&#x27;s Gym) and 14 affiliated debtors filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The debtors have requested joint administration of the cases under Case No. 20-31318. Like nearly all businesses, Gold&#x27;s Gym was required to temporarily close its US locations in March 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In April of the same year, Gold&#x27;s said that it would permanently close 30 of its locations. They said their filing for bankruptcy would only affect company-owned locations and set a reemergence goal for August 2020. The company owns about 10 percent of the nearly 700 worldwide locations.
Finally, on July 13, 2020, Gold&#x27;s Gym was auctioned due to a judicial auction procedure. Rainer Schaller, the owner of the German fitness company RSG Group, won the auction of Gold&#x27;s Gym for $100 million. Rainer Schaller fulfilled his dream to finally own the legendary fitness brand, which had inspired him to start his own fitness company in 1997. Previously, the RSG Group has been primarily active in Europe and expanded to a global company with the integration of Gold&#x27;s Gym into its portfolio.
Since, Gold&#x27;s Gym has been revitalized and it has also established a new presence in Europe by opening new gyms in Austria, Italy, and Germany. Also new gyms have been opened in e.g. Dallas, Highland Meadows, Georgetown. The expansion process continues worldwide, e.g. in Europe, India, Australia, etc., and includes modernization of many of its gyms. 
== Corporate information ==

In 2017, Gold&#x27;s Gym launched GOLD&#x27;S AMP, a fitness app that is meant to serve as a digital personal trainer for people to use anytime and anywhere. It includes numerous customization workout options led by Gold&#x27;s Gym coaches and thousands of music mixes.
In July 2020, new parent company RSG Group reported that Gold&#x27;s Gym had 61 company-owned gyms and over 600 franchise-owned gyms.
== Corporate sales and wellness program ==
Gold&#x27;s Gym operates a national corporate wellness program that has over 3000 company partners including Home Depot, Bank of America, Whataburger, and Union Pacific.

There is a wide range of different fitness courses in specially designated rooms. Personal trainers can be booked for an additional charge. All studios have at least one sauna, and some locations also have a posing room for preparing for bodybuilding competitions.

== Gold&#x27;s Gym Challenge USA and Fitness Competition ==
A major marketing campaign for members is the annual Gold&#x27;s Gym Challenge, which takes place in the USA. It is a 12-week competition that focuses on the visibility of body changes. In January of each year, participants begin by taking stock of their bodies by measuring and photographing them. After 12 weeks, measurements and photographs are taken again to document the results. Each participating Gold&#x27;s Gym selects its own winners, who then have to compete nationally. Finally, an overall winner is chosen.
The winners of the Gold&#x27;s Gym Challenge have been featured in numerous publications, including PopSugar, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and Women&#x27;s Health. 
In 2023 the Gold&#x27;s Gym Challenge USA was replaced by annual the Gold&#x27;s Gym Fitness Competition. 

== Nutritional supplements ==
A marketing division founded in 2021 by the RSG Group is Gold&#x27;s Gym Nutrition—a self-developed and distributed nutritional supplement line. The range offers various nutritional supplements for athletes in the form of drinks, shakes, bars, powders, and capsules. 

== Sportswear ==
Since the 1980s, Gold’s Gym has sold specially designed clothes with its logo of a bald weightlifter holding a barbell, which has become an iconic symbol within the bodybuilding scene. Today, the business branch &quot;Gold&#x27;s Gym Apparel&quot; designs its own functional sportswear and accessories for both genders by recognizing the legendary symbolism. Also, some elaborate items are produced sustainably in Portugal. In April 2024, Gold’s Gym Apparel was present for the first time at the world’s largest fitness and health trade fair FIBO in Cologne, Germany.

== Franchise groups ==
=== Gold’s Gym SoCal===
Gold’s Gym SoCal is a franchise group that owns 23 locations in the Southern California area and is operated by the Banos brothers, who opened their first gym in North Hollywood in 1988. The group’s president is Angel Banos and Brian Morris is its senior vice president.

=== Gold’s Gym India ===
Gold’s Gym India has more than 150 locations in about 90+ cities of India. Gold’s Gym has started its presence in Mumbai in 2002. It is the second-largest fitness group in India. Their founders are Rajesh Advani and Jagdish K. Valecha. Today it is owned by &quot;Fitness Unicorn Cult.fit&quot;.

=== Gold’s Gym Japan ===

In Japan, the largest franchise owner is Eiji Tezuka, who has grown Gold’s Gym in Japan to more than 95 facilities across the country. 

=== Gold’s Gym Arabia ===

The franchise group Gold’s Gym Arabia has over 70 gyms in Saudi Arabia. The owner of the group is Batterjee Holding Co. in Jeddah. The gyms use state-of-the-art Matrix Fitness equipment. Gold’s Gym has become a pioneer in female fitness in Saudi Arabia.

== Criticism ==
Numerous customers have reported that Gold&#x27;s Gym franchises have acted in dishonest and unscrupulous ways. They cite advertised deals not being honored, billing irregularities, contract terms being fraudulently altered by sales staff after signing, and problems canceling accounts or relocating. A Gold&#x27;s Gym in Provo, Utah, was successfully sued for fraud in 2006, for changing a contract after it was signed in 1999.

An accusation of the same conduct of fraud arose again in 2017: on February 10, 2017, the billing processor for the gyms, Paramount Acceptance, and 26 companies under the VASA Fitness name (including new gyms since 2014) were served with a consumer class action lawsuit with numerous causes of action including fraudulent misrepresentation, violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and violations of the Utah Consumer Sales Practices Act. The plaintiff published the entire complaint.

After ten years of litigation involving a licensing agreement for a fitness center in St. George, the Utah Supreme Court affirmed a decision to deny attorney fees to Gold&#x27;s Gym even though Gold&#x27;s Gym prevailed in the underlying litigation (&quot;Gold&#x27;s Gym International, Inc. v. Chambers&quot;, 2020 UT 20).

<doc id="819062" wikidata="Q4897278" url="?curid=819062" title="Beta Sigma Phi">
<text>Beta Sigma Phi International () is an international noncollegiate sorority with 200,000 members. Founded in Abilene, Kansas, in 1931 by Walter W. Ross &quot;for the social, cultural, and civic enrichment of its members&quot;, the organization is now present throughout the United States, Canada, and other countries.

==History==

The organization started under the name The National What to Read Club. Walter W. Ross, the founder of Beta Sigma Phi, visited Vinita, Oklahoma, where librarian Leona Schroers agreed to help establish a chapter in the town. The original group consisted of seven members in Abilene Kansas.

Schroers introduced Ross to Sally Rogers McSpadden, sister of the humorist Will Rogers. McSpadden was active in the Oklahoma Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, as well as other women&#x27;s organizations, and advised Ross to change the organization from an association to its present form, along with changing the name. A new framework for the organization was developed. 

Beta Sigma Phi was established in 1931. In April 1932, Beta Sigma Phi was incorporated under a charter granted by the state of Missouri. Its focus was community service, the development of cultural appreciation, fostering an appreciation for the liberal arts, and fellowship. Its members consisted of women who were unable to attend college. Members presented and attended concerts, exhibitions, lectures, and plays. They also help dance and music recitals.

Today, Beta Sigma Phi is a nonprofit corporation which maintains a contract with Walter W. Ross &amp; Company for business management of its affairs. In addition to the international constitution, each chapter composes its bylaws. By 1966, the sorority had more than 8,000 chapters and 185,000 members in fifteen countries. In 1975, it had more than 10,000 chapters and over 250,000 members.

The organization initiated its millionth member, Denise Emerson, in 1995, to the &quot;Gamma Alpha Iota chapter&quot; in Ontario, California. It currently has 200,000 active members. Its headquarters are in Kansas City, Missouri.

==Symbols==
The sorority&#x27;s Greek letter name derived from its motto; the letters Beta Sigma and Phi were the first letters of the Greek words for &quot;Life, Learning, and Friendship&quot;. Its colors are black and gold. Its flower is the yellow rose. Its symbol is the torch. 

The sorority has four books for the Ritual of Jewels chapters, covering &quot;Beauty&quot;, &quot;Happiness&quot;, &quot;Pathes to Loveliness&quot;, and &quot;Conduct, Expression, Purpose&quot;.

==Activities==
Beta Sigma Phi is primarily social. At its regular meetings, its members take turns presenting cultural programs. Chapter also coordinate theater parties, tour museums, and attend concerts.

The sorority organizes annual state conventions and celebrates its Founders Day. Chapter also holds annual Valentine Balls where chapters select a Queen, Sweetheart, or Princess, depending on the type of chapter the international sorority then selects an overall winner. The candidates are selected for their representation of the ideals of Beta Sigma Phi. 

&quot;The Torch&quot; is the magazine of Beta Sigma Phi, publishing stories and poems by members, personality sketches of International Honorary Members and others, and short story and poetry contests.

==Philanthropy==
*International Endowment Fund – Health research groups &amp; charities
*Disaster Relief Fund – Aids members who are victims of natural disasters
*Breast Cancer Research Fund – Supports research organizations
*Scholarship Fund – Awards scholarships to members, their children and grandchildren

==Membership==
Beta Sigma Phi is a non-political, non-sectarian organization. Its membership is open to women of all ages and backgrounds. The sorority also awards honorary memberships to women who have achieved worldwide recognition in their field.

==Chapters==
Most Beta Sigma Phi chapters are community-based, but the sorority also has chapters on college campuses and several online chapters. As of 2024, it has 5,078 chapters.

==Career==
During the 1960s, Gemma Jones performed with companies at regional theatres including the Nottingham Playhouse, Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the Little Theatre, Bristol. In 1962 she appeared at the Mermaid Theatre as Gilda in the original stage production of Alfie. In the 1970s, Jones performed in productions with the National Theatre at the Old Vic and with the Royal Shakespeare Company as Hippolyta/Titania. Jones made many further performances in classical and contemporary plays with the RSC in the 1980s and 1990s, including appearances in separate productions of The Winters Tale as both Hermione (1981) and a decade later as Paulina (1993). In 1986, she played the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi in &quot;After Aida&quot; at the Old Vic Theatre. 

On television Jones became known to viewers after starring in the BBC serial &quot;Kenilworth&quot; (1967) as Queen Elizabeth I, and in BBC 2&#x27;s 1970 dramatisation of &quot;The Spoils of Poynton&quot;.

She was first recognised outside the UK in the mid-1970s, after playing the Empress Frederick in the BBC television drama series &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot; and Louisa Trotter in another BBC drama, &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot;. In 1980, she played the role of Portia in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, opposite Warren Mitchell&#x27;s Shylock.

Jones played Madeleine de Brou in the 1971 Ken Russell film &quot;The Devils&quot;. She played Mrs. Dashwood alongside Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson in the Academy Award-winning period drama &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995).

From 2007 to 2008, she played Connie James in the BBC1 drama &quot;Spooks&quot;. She appeared in the Woody Allen film &quot;You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger&quot; in 2010. In 2011, she appeared in the BBC1 series &quot;Merlin&quot;, as the Cailleach, the gatekeeper to the spirit world. Also in 2011 she appeared in the Bridge Project&#x27;s version of &quot;Richard III&quot; as Queen Margaret, alongside Kevin Spacey as Richard III and directed by Sam Mendes, at the Old Vic and subsequently on an international tour.

She received the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Neil Baldwin&#x27;s mother, Mary, in the 2014 television film &quot;Marvellous&quot;.

<text>Jack H. Metcalf (November 30, 1927 – March 15, 2007) was an American politician and educator and who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001. He represented the 2nd district of Washington State and was a 

==Biography==
Born in Marysville, Washington, and raised in Langley, Metcalf graduated from high school and entered the U.S. Army, and was discharged in 1947. He then worked for two years with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a marshal in Alaska. Metcalf received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education from Pacific Lutheran University in 1951, and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Washington in Seattle in 1966. Metcalf was a high school and junior high teacher (civics, math) for thirty years, mostly in Everett, later retiring to run a bed and breakfast on his family&#x27;s homestead at Langley.

Metcalf was first elected to the state legislature in 1960, representing the 38th District. Defeated for a third term in 1964, he was elected to the state senate in 1966 from the 21st District and served until 1974, and served again from the 10th District from 1980 to 1992. He twice ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Democrat Warren Magnuson for the U.S. Senate in 1968 and 1974. In 1992, Metcalf again sought national office, but was unable to defeat incumbent Democrat Al Swift in the House election.

With Swift retiring from the House in 1994, Metcalf ran yet again. This time, he was elected; he was re-elected in 1996 and 1998. A supporter of term limits such as those proposed in the 1994 Contract with America (which Metcalf had signed), Metcalf did not run for re-election in 2000 in order to honor his 1994 campaign promise that if elected he would serve three terms then no longer defend his seat.

A Goldwater conservative, during the latter part of his political career Metcalf was known as an opponent of the Federal Reserve, which he considered unconstitutional. He also built a close relationship with many in organized labor, especially with the building trade unions. In his last term in office (1998–2000) he surprised some observers by taking some additional positions unusual for a conservative Republican, such as working with Paul Watson and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to protest whaling by the Makah people, and hiring Washington state antiwar speaker and writer Craig B. Hulet as a special assistant. He also cosponsored legislation with Congressman Dennis Kucinich to label genetically modified foods.

Metcalf also demonstrated a strong pragmatic streak while serving in Congress, including seeking out a position as a conferee on the TEA-21 Act of 1998. He delivered significant funding for a number of transportation infrastructure programs because of this work. He was also a strong supporter of both Boeing and its workers. In 1999 shortly after the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 (a Boeing 767) he and his wife travelled to Egypt via EgyptAir in order to show his confidence in the professionalism of the Egyptian flight crews and airlines, as well as the aircraft they flew.

Metcalf was highly supportive of Congress&#x27; commissioning of the Sacagawea dollar. In an interview, he cited how it would aid the economy by lasting for decades, whereas the average $1 bill wears out in about eighteen months from changing hands over four hundred times.

In November 1997, Metcalf was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Metcalf voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Metcalf voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the majority of votes needed to be adopted).

Metcalf died at age 79 at an Alzheimer&#x27;s care facility in Oak Harbor. He was buried at Bayview Cemetery in Langley, Washington.

==Legacy==
A number of Metcalf&#x27;s staff went on to run for or serve in public office, including State Representatives Kirk Pearson (39th leg.), Chris Strow (10th leg.) and Norma Smith (10th leg.). Lew Moore who served as Chief of Staff for much of Metcalf&#x27;s tenure ran for Snohomish County Executive in 1999 and served as campaign manager for Congressman Ron Paul&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

On May 8, 2008, the ferry terminal in Clinton was named after Metcalf, in part for his work to secure funding for safety improvements to it while a member of Congress.

<doc id="819116" wikidata="Q746728" url="?curid=819116" title="Two Trees of Valinor">
<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, the Two Trees of Valinor are Telperion and Laurelin, the Silver Tree and the Gold Tree, which bring light to Valinor, a paradisiacal realm where angelic beings live. The Two Trees are of enormous stature, and exude dew that is a pure and magical light in liquid form. The Elf craftsman Fëanor makes the unrivalled jewels, the Silmarils, with their light. The Two Trees are destroyed by the evil beings Ungoliant and Melkor, but their last flower and fruit are made into the Moon and the Sun. Melkor, now known as Morgoth, steals the Silmarils, provoking the disastrous War of the Jewels. Descendants of Telperion survive, growing in Númenor and, after its destruction, in Gondor; in both cases the trees are symbolic of those kingdoms. For many years while Gondor has no King, the White Tree of Gondor stands dead in the citadel of Minas Tirith. When Aragorn restores the line of Kings to Gondor, he finds a sapling descended from Telperion and plants it in his citadel. 

Commentators have seen mythic and Christian symbolism in the Two Trees; they have been called the most important symbols in the entire legendarium. Their origins have been traced to the medieval Trees of the Sun and the Moon. Parallels have also been identified with Celtic mythology, where several pairs of trees appear. The White Tree of Gondor, too, has been traced to the medieval Dry Tree, a symbol of resurrection. Verlyn Flieger has described the progressive splintering of the light of the Two Trees through Middle-earth&#x27;s troubled history, noting that light represents the Christian &quot;Logos&quot;. Tom Shippey links the sundering of the Elves into different groups to the Two Trees and to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; which speaks of light and dark Elves; Tolkien treats the difference between these as whether they have made the journey to Valinor and seen the light of the Two Trees.

== Narrative ==

=== Prelude ===

The first sources of light for all of Tolkien&#x27;s imaginary world, Arda, are two enormous Lamps on the central continent, Middle-earth: Illuin, the silver one to the north, and Ormal, the golden one to the south. They are created by the Valar, powerful spirit beings, but are cast down and destroyed by the Dark Lord Melkor.

=== Creation ===

The Valar retreat to Valinor to make their home on the western continent, and there one of them, Yavanna the Vala of living things, sings into existence the Two Trees to provide a new pair of light-sources. Of the two, Telperion is male and silver, while the other, Laurelin, is female and golden. The Trees stand on the hill Ezellohar, outside Valimar, the city of the Valar. They grow in the presence of all the Valar, watered by the tears of the Vala of pity and mourning, Nienna. Telperion&#x27;s leaves are dark green above and silver below. His flowers are white like cherry blossom, and his silvery dew is collected as a source of water and of light. Varda used the dew to form stars in the sky, in preparation for the arrival of the Elves. Laurelin has leaves of a young green, like newly opened beech leaves trimmed with gold, and her dew is collected by the Vala of light Varda.

Each Tree, in turn, gives off light for seven hours (waxing to full brightness and then slowly waning again), with the ends of their cycles overlapping, so that at one hour each of &quot;dawn&quot; and &quot;dusk&quot; soft gold and silver light are given off together. Each &quot;day&quot; of first silver then gold light lasts twelve hours.

=== Destruction ===

Countless &quot;days&quot; pass, until Melkor reappears. He enlists the help of the giant spider Ungoliant to destroy the Two Trees. Concealed in a cloud of darkness, Melkor strikes each Tree and the insatiable Ungoliant devours whatever life and light remains in it.

=== Aftermath ===

Yavanna and Nienna attempt a healing, but they succeed only in reviving Telperion&#x27;s last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurelin&#x27;s last fruit (to become the Sun). These are turned into flying ships crossing the sky, and each is steered by spirits of the same &#x27;genders&#x27; as the Trees themselves: male Tilion and female Arien. This is why, in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Sun is called &quot;she&quot; and the Moon &quot;he&quot;. The true light of the Trees now resides only in the three Silmarils, jewels created with the light of the Two Trees before their destruction, by the Elf Fëanor.

Because the Elves that first come to Valinor especially love Telperion, Yavanna takes a cutting from the tree and makes a second tree like it to stand in their city of Tirion. This tree, named Galathilion, is identical to Telperion except that it does not emit light. It has many seedlings, one of which is named Celeborn, and grows on the isle of Tol Eressëa. In the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn is brought as a gift to the Men who live on the island of Númenor. It is Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor. When the dark lord Sauron takes control of the island, he makes king Ar-Pharazôn cut it down. The hero Isildur saves a single fruit of Nimloth, and plants seedlings in Middle-earth. During the rule of the Stewards of Gondor, the White Tree of Gondor, a descendant of Nimloth, stands dead in the citadel of Minas Tirith. On Aragorn&#x27;s return as King at the end of the Third Age, he finds a seedling in the snow on the mountain behind the city, and brings it back to the citadel, where it flourishes.

Tolkien never mentioned any tree made in the likeness of Laurelin, writing that &quot;of Laurelin the Golden no likeness is left in Middle-Earth&quot;. In the First Age, however, the Elvish King Turgon of the city of Gondolin creates a non-living image of Laurelin, named &quot;Glingal&quot;, &#x27;Hanging Flame&#x27;, which stands in his court. 

== Origins ==

=== Medieval Trees of the Sun and the Moon ===

The Tolkien scholar John Garth traces the mythology and symbolism of the Two Trees to the medieval Trees of the Sun and the Moon. Tolkien stated in an interview that the Two Trees derived from them, &quot;in the great Alexander stories&quot; rather than from the World Tree Yggdrasil of Norse myth. Garth notes that the &quot;Wonders of the East&quot;, an Old English manuscript in the same Codex as &quot;Beowulf&quot;, tells that Alexander the Great travelled beyond India to Paradise, where he saw the two magical trees. They drip down a wonderful balsam, and have the power of speech. They tell Alexander that he will die in Babylon. Garth writes that Tolkien&#x27;s trees emit light, not balsam; and instead of prophesying death, their own deaths bring Arda&#x27;s era of immortality to an end.

=== Trees in Celtic mythology ===

Marie Barnfield, writing in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, states that the male/female pair of trees has numerous parallels in Celtic mythology, including the pine trees of Deirdre and Naoise, and the paired rose bush of Esyllt and vine of Trystan. Further, the hill of Ezellohar in front of Valimar&#x27;s western gate matches the &quot;sacred centre of Ireland&quot;, the Hill of Uisneach &quot;to the west of Tara&quot;. The Two Trees of Valinor, in this context, align with the &quot;feminine&quot; Ash tree of Uisnech, and the &quot;masculine&quot; &quot;Lia Fáil&quot;, the standing stone on the hill of Tara. Lastly, the dews of Telperion and the rains from Laurelin that served &quot;as wells of water and of light&quot; match up, according to Barnfield, with Connla&#x27;s Well and the Well of Segais.

=== The Sampo in the &quot;Kalevala&quot; ===

Tolkien read the Finnish &quot;Kalevala&quot; closely. Its central symbol is the magical Sampo, a device that brought wealth and good fortune to its owner, but whose mechanism is described only vaguely. Jonathan Himes, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, has suggested that Tolkien found the Sampo complex, and chose to split the Sampo&#x27;s parts into desirable objects. Its pillar became the Two Trees of Valinor with their Tree of life aspect, illuminating the world. Its decorated lid became the brilliant Silmarils, which embodied all that was left of the light of the Two Trees, thus tying the symbols together.

=== The Dry Tree ===

Cynthia Cohen writes in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot; that the White Tree of Gondor in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; stands for &quot;the deeper history of Men in Tolkien&#x27;s Secondary World, reaching back to [its ancestors,] the Two Trees of Valinor&quot;. During most of the action of the novel, the tree is dead, and has been for over a century, but all the same it serves as a symbol of Gondor&#x27;s strength and national identity, and of hope for the Kingdom&#x27;s renewal. She suggests that the White Tree parallels the Dry Tree mentioned in the 14th century text &quot;Mandeville&#x27;s Travels&quot;. The Dry Tree had been alive in the time of Christ, and was prophesied to come to life again when a &quot;great lord from the western part of the world&quot; returned to the Holy Land, just as Aragorn brings the line of Kings back to Gondor. Cohen comments that the dead White Tree&#x27;s replacement by a living sapling &quot;upholds the metaphor of resurrection and enables Tolkien to draw an implicit connection between Aragorn and Christ&quot;. Finally, she remarks on the verse that Aragorn recites when he sees the White Mountains of Gondor: &quot;West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree / Fell like bright rain in gardens in the Kings of old,&quot; which she states links Telperion, the Silver Tree of Valinor, to the White Tree. Since Tolkien has left it ambiguous whether the Silver Tree of the verse, the place where the West Wind blew, or where the &quot;bright rain&quot; fell, are in long-ago Valinor or present-time Gondor, the ancestry of the tree and the lineage of the Kings merge into a continuum.

Patrick Curry, in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that the importance that Tolkien gives to the Two Trees shows &quot;the iconic status of trees in both his work and his life.&quot; Richard Goetsch adds that the Two Trees are &quot;central to many of the crucial plot developments of the entire saga, from the beginning of the First Age to the end of the Third Age&quot;, and further that they &quot;function as the ultimate expression of the natural world in Tolkien&#x27;s mythos.&quot;

== Analysis ==

=== The Elder Days ===

Matthew Dickerson writes in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that the Two Trees are &quot;the most important mythic symbols in all of the legendarium&quot;. He quotes Tolkien&#x27;s words in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; that &quot;about their fate all the tales of the Elder days are woven&quot;. They have that central place because they are the source of the light for the world of Arda while they live, and they are the ancestors of the various trees that symbolise the Kingdoms of Númenor and later of Gondor. Further, they contain the &quot;thought of things that grow in the earth&quot;, placed in them by the Vala Yavanna when she sang them into being. Angelica Varandas likewise comments that the Two Trees are &quot;the most significant symbols of peace, prosperity and order&quot; in the legendarium, and calls them &quot;axis mundi&quot; trees, like those in the Garden of Eden or the Norse world-tree, Yggdrasil.

=== Light ===

Tolkien, as a Roman Catholic, knew the significance of light in Christian symbolism; he equated it with the Christian &quot;Logos&quot;, the Divine Word. The scholar Lisa Coutras states that transcendental light is an essential element of his subcreated world. In it, the Two Trees embody the light of creation, which in turn reflects God&#x27;s light. 

Verlyn Flieger describes the progressive splintering of the first created light, down through successive catastrophes. After the destruction of the twin lamps of Arda, Yavanna recreates what she can of the light in the Two Trees; Varda catches some of the light, and Fëanor creates the Silmarils, filled with the light. They are the unrivalled jewels that give &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; its name, and serve as the centrepiece of its narrative. The whole of the history of Tolkien&#x27;s First Age is strongly affected by the desire of many characters, including the dark lord Morgoth (as Melkor is now known) to possess the Silmarils that contain the only remaining unsullied light of the Trees. Morgoth desires them for himself, and manages to steal them, provoking the world-changing War of the Jewels. One of the Silmarils survives, and Varda puts it in the sky to symbolise hope: it is Venus, the Morning and Evening Star.

Tom Shippey, like Tolkien a philologist, analyses Tolkien&#x27;s treatment of the light and dark elves mentioned in the 13th century &quot;Prose Edda&quot;: in Old Norse, &quot;Ljósálfar&quot; and &quot;Dökkálfar&quot;. Tolkien makes the distinguishing feature between these two groups whether the Elves had seen the light of the Two Trees of Valinor, or not. To make this work, Tolkien creates a story in which the Elves awaken in Middle-earth, and are called to undertake the long journey to Valinor. The Elves of the Light, Tolkien&#x27;s Calaquendi, are those who successfully complete the journey, while the Elves of the Darkness, the Moriquendi, are those Elves who, for whatever reason, do not arrive in Valinor.

=== Elves and Men ===

Matthew Dickerson writes that in the Second and Third Ages, the White Trees of Númenor and of Gondor, whose likeness descends from that of Telperion, have a mostly symbolic significance, standing both for the kingdoms in question, and also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the Men who had lived on Númenor and the Elves. The destruction of one of these trees precedes trouble for each kingdom in question.

Martin Simonson describes the destruction of the Two Trees as setting a &quot;mythical precedent&quot; for the transfer of the stewardship of Arda (Earth) from the Valar to Elves and Men. In his view, this stewardship is central to the moral battle, as the Two Trees, like Men and Elves, are composed of both matter and spirit.
Dickerson and Jonathan Evans note that Tolkien calls the Elves &quot;stewards and guardians of [Middle-earth&#x27;s] beauty&quot;; they are constantly preoccupied with maintaining the beauty of nature, something they inherited from Yavanna&#x27;s making of the Two Trees.

<text>The Burmese python (Python bivittatus) is one of the largest species of snakes. It is native to a large area of Southeast Asia and is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Until 2009, it was considered a subspecies of the Indian python, but is now recognized as a distinct species. It is an invasive species in Florida as a result of the pet trade.

==Description==
The Burmese python is a dark-colored non-venomous snake with many brown blotches bordered by black down the back.
In the wild, Burmese pythons typically grow to , while specimens of more than are unconfirmed. This species is sexually dimorphic in size; females average only slightly longer, but are considerably heavier and bulkier than the males. For example, length-weight comparisons in captive Burmese pythons for individual females have shown: at length, a specimen weighed , a specimen of just over weighed , a specimen of weighed , and a specimen of weighed . In comparison, length-weight comparisons for males found: a specimen of weighed , weighed , a specimen of weighed , and a specimen of weighed . In general, individuals over are rare. The record for maximum length of a Burmese python is and was caught 10 July 2023 in South Florida&#x27;s Big Cypress National Preserve. Widely published data of specimens reported to have been several feet longer are not verified. At her death, a Burmese named &quot;Baby&quot; was the heaviest snake recorded in the world at the time at , much heavier than any wild snake ever measured. Her length was measured at circa 1999. The minimum size for adults is . Dwarf forms occur in Java, Bali, and Sulawesi, with an average length of in Bali, and a maximum of on Sulawesi. Wild individuals average long, but have been known to reach .

===Diseases===
In both their native and invasive range they suffer from &quot;Raillietiella orientalis&quot; (a pentastome parasitic disease).

==Distribution and habitat==
The Burmese python occurs throughout Southern and Southeast Asia, including eastern India, southeastern Nepal, western Bhutan, southeastern Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, northern continental Malaysia, and southern China in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It also occurs in Hong Kong, and in Indonesia on Java, southern Sulawesi, Bali, and Sumbawa. It has also been reported in Kinmen.

It is an excellent swimmer and needs a permanent source of water. It lives in grasslands, marshes, swamps, rocky foothills, woodlands, river valleys, and jungles with open clearings. It is a good climber and has a prehensile tail. It can stay in water for 30 minutes but mostly stays on land.

==As an invasive species==

Python invasion has been particularly extensive, notably across South Florida, where a large number of pythons can now be found in the Florida Everglades. Between 1996 and 2006, the Burmese python gained popularity in the pet trade, with more than 90,000 snakes imported into the U.S. The current number of Burmese pythons in the Florida Everglades may have reached a minimum viable population and become an invasive species. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 was deemed responsible for the destruction of a python-breeding facility and zoo, and these escaped snakes spread and populated areas into the Everglades. More than 1,330 have been captured in the Everglades. A genetic study in 2017 revealed that the python population is composed of hybrids between the Burmese python and Indian python. The species also displays cytonuclear discordance which has made phylogenetic studies of its origin more complicated.

By 2007, the Burmese python was found in northern Florida and in the coastal areas of the Florida Panhandle. The importation of Burmese pythons was banned in the United States in January 2012 by the U.S. Department of the Interior. A 2012 report stated, &quot;in areas where the snakes are well established, foxes, and rabbits have disappeared. Sightings of raccoons are down by 99.3%, opossums by 98.9%, and white-tailed deer by 94.1%.&quot; Road surveys between 2003 and 2011 indicated an 87.3% decrease in bobcat populations, and in some areas rabbits have not been detected at all. Experimental efforts to reintroduce rabbit populations to areas where rabbits have been eliminated have mostly failed &quot;due to high (77% of mortalities) rates of predation by pythons.&quot; Bird and coyote populations may be threatened, as well as the already-rare Florida panther. In addition to this correlational relationship, the pythons have also been experimentally shown to decrease marsh rabbit populations, further suggesting they are responsible for many of the recorded mammal declines. They may also outcompete native predators for food.

For example, Burmese pythons also compete with the native American alligator, and numerous instances of alligators and pythons attacking—and in some cases, preying on—each other have been reported and recorded.

By 2011, researchers identified up to 25 species of birds from nine avian orders in the digestive tract remains of 85 Burmese pythons found in Everglades National Park. Native bird populations are suffering a negative impact from the introduction of the Burmese python in Florida; among these bird species, the wood stork is of specific concern, now listed as federally endangered.

Numerous efforts have been made to eliminate the Burmese python population in the last decade. Understanding the preferred habitat of the species is needed to narrow down the python hunt. Burmese pythons have been found to select broad-leafed and low-flooded habitats. Broad-leafed habitats comprise cypress, overstory, and coniferous forest. Though aquatic marsh environments would be a great source for prey, the pythons seem to prioritize environments allowing for morphological and behavioral camouflage to be protected from predators. Also, the Burmese pythons in Florida have been found to prefer elevated habitats, since this provides the optimal conditions for nesting. In addition to elevated habitats, edge habitats are common places where Burmese pythons are found for thermoregulation, nesting, and hunting purposes.

One of the Burmese python eradication movements with the biggest influence was the 2013 Florida Python Challenge. This was a month-long contest wherein a total of 68 pythons were removed. The contest offered incentives such as prizes for longest and greatest number of captured pythons. The purpose of the challenge was to raise awareness about the invasive species, increase participation from the public and agency cooperation, and to remove as many pythons as possible from the Florida Everglades. The challenge has run a few times again since then and is now an annual event over the duration of ten days. Recently, in 2023, it resulted in 209 pythons removed by 1,050 participants.

A study from 2017 introduced a new method for identifying the presence of Burmese pythons in southern Florida; this method involves the screening of mosquito blood. Since the introduction of the Burmese python in Florida, mosquito communities use the pythons as hosts even though they are recently introduced.

Invasive Burmese pythons also face certain physiological changes. Unlike their native South Asian counterparts who spend long periods fasting due to seasonal variation in prey availability, pythons in Florida feed year-round due to the constant availability of food. They are also vulnerable to cold stress, with winter freezes resulting in mortality rates of up to 90%. Genomic data suggests natural selection on these populations favors increased thermal tolerance as a result of these high-mortality freezes.

They have carried &quot;Raillietiella orientalis&quot;, a pentastome parasitic disease, with them from Southeast Asia. Other reptiles in Florida have become infested, and the parasite appears to have become endemic.

In April 2019, researchers captured and killed a large Burmese python in Florida&#x27;s Big Cypress National Preserve. It was more than long, weighed , and contained 73 developing eggs.
In December 2021, a Burmese python was captured in Florida that weighed and had a length of ; it contained a record 122 developing eggs.
In July 2023, local hunters captured and killed a long Burmese python that weighed in Florida&#x27;s Big Cypress National Preserve.

==Behavior==
Burmese pythons are mainly nocturnal rainforest dwellers. When young, they are equally at home on the ground and in trees, but as they gain girth, they tend to restrict most of their movements to the ground. They are also excellent swimmers, being able to stay submerged for up to half an hour. Burmese pythons spend the majority of their time hidden in the underbrush. In the northern parts of its range, the Burmese python may brumate for some months during the cold season in a hollow tree, a hole in the riverbank, or under rocks. Brumation is biologically distinct from hibernation. While the behavior has similar benefits, allowing organisms to endure the winter without moving, it also involves the preparation of both male and female reproductive organs for the upcoming breeding season. The Florida population also goes through brumation.

They tend to be solitary and are usually found in pairs only when mating. Burmese pythons breed in the early spring, with females laying clutches of 12–36 eggs in March or April. They remain with the eggs until they hatch, wrapping around them and twitching their muscles in such a way as to raise the ambient temperature around the eggs by several degrees. Once the hatchlings use their egg tooth to cut their way out of their eggs, no further maternal care is given. The newly hatched babies often remain inside their eggs until they are ready to complete their first shedding of skin, after which they hunt for their first meal.

===Parthenogenesis===
The Burmese python is able to reproduce asexually when in captivity. Offspring are clones of their mother and reproduction appears to be by a parthenogenetic mechanism that involves a modification of the meiotic process.

==Diet==

Like all snakes, the Burmese python is carnivorous. Its diet consists primarily of birds and mammals, but also includes amphibians and reptiles. It is a sit-and-wait predator, meaning it spends most of its time staying relatively still, waiting for prey to approach, then striking rapidly. The snake grabs a prey animal with its sharp teeth, then wraps its body around the animal to kill it through constriction. The python then swallows its prey whole. It is often found near human habitation due to the presence of rats, mice, and other vermin as a food source. However, its equal affinity for domesticated birds and mammals means it is often treated as a pest. In captivity, its diet consists primarily of commercially available appropriately sized rats, graduating to larger prey such as rabbits and poultry as it grows. As an invasive species in Florida, Burmese pythons primarily eat a variety of small mammals including foxes, rabbits, and raccoons. Due to their high predation levels, they have been implicated in the decline and even disappearance of many mammal species. In their invasive range, pythons also eat birds and occasionally other reptiles. Exceptionally large pythons may even require larger food items such as pigs or goats, and are known to have attacked and eaten alligators and adult deer in Florida.

===Digestion===
The digestive response of Burmese pythons to such large prey has made them a model species for digestive physiology. Its sit-and-wait hunting style is characterized by long fasting periods in between meals, with Burmese pythons typically feeding every month or two, but sometimes fasting for as long as 18 months. As digestive tissues are energetically costly to maintain, they are downregulated during fasting periods to conserve energy when they are not in use. A fasting python has a reduced stomach volume and acidity, reduced intestinal mass, and a &#x27;normal&#x27; heart volume. After ingesting prey, the entire digestive system undergoes a massive re-modelling, with rapid hypertrophy of the intestines, production of stomach acid, and a 40% increase in mass of the ventricle of the heart to fuel the digestive process. During digestion, the snake&#x27;s oxygen consumption rises drastically as well, increasing with meal size by 17 to 40 times its resting rate. This dramatic increase is a result of the energetic cost of restarting many aspects of the digestive system, from rebuilding the stomach and small intestine to producing hydrochloric acid to be secreted in the stomach. Hydrochloric acid production is a significant component of the energetic cost of digestion, as digesting whole prey items requires the animal to be broken down without the use of teeth, either for chewing or tearing into smaller pieces. To compensate, once food has been ingested, Burmese pythons begin producing large amounts of acid to make the stomach acidic enough to turn the food into a semi-liquid that can be passed through to the small intestine and undergo the rest of the digestive process.

The energy cost is highest in the first few days after eating when these regenerative processes are most active, meaning Burmese pythons rely on existing food energy storage to digest a new meal. Overall, the entire digestive process from food intake to defecation lasts 8–14 days.

==Conservation==

The Burmese python is listed on CITES Appendix II. It has been listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2012, as the wild population is estimated to have declined by at least 30% in the first decade of the 21st century due to habitat loss and over-harvesting.

To maintain Burmese python populations, the IUCN recommends increased conservation legislation and enforcement at the national and international levels to reduce harvesting across the snake&#x27;s native range. The IUCN also recommends increased research into its population ecology and threats. In Hong Kong, it is a protected species under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170. It is also protected in Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia. However, it is still common only in Hong Kong and Thailand, with rare to very rare statuses in the rest of its range.

==In captivity==
Burmese pythons are often sold as pets, and are made popular by their attractive coloration and apparently easy-going nature. However, they have a rapid growth rate, and can exceed in length in a year if power fed. However this may cause health issues in the future. By age four, they will have reached their adult size, though they continue growing very slowly throughout their lives, which may exceed 20 years.

Although the species has a reputation for docility, they are very powerful animals – capable of inflicting severe bites and even killing by constriction. They also consume large amounts of food, and due to their size, require large, often custom-built, secure enclosures. As a result, some are released into the wild, and become invasive species that devastate the environment. For this reason, some jurisdictions (including Florida, due to the python invasion in the Everglades) have placed restrictions on the keeping of Burmese pythons as pets. Violators could be imprisoned for more than seven years or fined $500,000 if convicted.

Burmese pythons are opportunistic feeders; they eat almost any time food is offered, and often act hungry even when they have recently eaten. As a result, they are often overfed, causing obesity-related problems to be common in captive Burmese pythons.

Like the much smaller ball python, Burmese pythons are known to be easygoing or timid creatures, which means that if cared for properly, they can easily adjust to living near humans.

===Handling===
Although pythons are typically afraid of people due to their great stature, and generally avoid them, special care is still required when handling them. Given their adult strength, multiple handlers (up to one person per meter of snake) are usually recommended. Some jurisdictions require owners to hold special licenses, and as with any wild animal being kept in captivity, treating them with the respect an animal of this size commands is important.

===Variations===

The Burmese python is frequently captive-bred for color, pattern, and more recently, size. Its amelanistic form is especially popular and is the most widely available morph. This morph is white with patterns in butterscotch yellow and burnt orange. Also, &quot;labyrinth&quot; specimens with maze-like patterns, khaki-colored &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;granite&quot; with many small angular spots are available. Breeders have recently begun working with an island lineage of Burmese pythons. Early reports indicate that these dwarf Burmese pythons have slightly different coloring and pattern from their mainland relatives and do not grow much over in length. One of the most sought-after of these variations is the leucistic Burmese. This particular variety is very rare, being entirely bright white with no pattern and blue eyes, and has only in 2008/2009 been reproduced in captivity as the homozygous form (referred to as &quot;super&quot; by reptile keepers) of the co-dominant hypomelanistic trait. The caramel Burmese python has a caramel-colored pattern with &quot;milk-chocolate&quot; eyes.

<text>Allan Byron Swift (September 12, 1935 – April 20, 2018) was an American Emmy award–winning broadcaster and politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for eight terms from 1979 to 1995. He represented the Second Congressional District of Washington as a Democrat.

== Biography ==
Swift was born in Tacoma, Washington, in 1935. He studied for two years at Whitman College where he was a member of the Sigma Chi Chapter. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Central Washington College of Education in 1957.

Prior to his sixteen years in Congress, Swift was a broadcaster in several stations throughout Washington State in the towns of Walla Walla (KUJ), Ellensburg (KXLE) and Bellingham (KVOS-TV). At KVOS, he was Director of News and Public Affairs, producing a series of weekly public interest programs and documentaries and earning an Emmy from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

=== Congress ===
He was first elected to the House in 1978, replacing the retiring Lloyd Meeds, for whom Swift had served as an administrative assistant from 1965 to 1969 and from 1977 to 1978. Swift won re-election in 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1992. Swift served on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, of which he was the 5th ranking member during his final term and chair of the subcommittee on Transportation and Hazardous Materials. He also chaired the Subcommittee on Elections of the House Administration Committee. Among his accomplishments was authorship of Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which was designed to support emergency planning regarding Superfund sites. Swift also authored and led the passage of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, otherwise known as motor-voter, which expanded voter registration options nationwide including drivers license offices and mail-in registration. He retired and did not run for re-election in 1994, an election in which the Democrats lost this seat.

=== Later career ===
Following his final term in Congress, Swift was Vice President of Governmental Affairs with Burlington Northern Railroad until its merger with Santa Fe Railroad in 1996 and had a new railroad siding south of Blaine, WA named after him (Swift) . He was later a principal with the Washington, D.C., political strategy firm Colling, Swift &amp; Hynes and a regular member of the internet based radio talk show called Backroom Politics. He and his wife, Paula, had two daughters, Amy Swift Donovan and Lauri Swift, and resided in Alexandria, Virginia.

=== Death ===
Swift died on April 20, 2018, in Alexandria, Virginia.

<text>The County Connection (officially, the Central Contra Costa Transit Authority, CCCTA) is a Concord-based public transit agency operating fixed-route bus and ADA paratransit (County Connection LINK) service in and around central Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay Area. Established in 1980 as a joint powers authority, CCCTA assumed control of public bus service within central Contra Costa first begun by Oakland-based AC Transit as it expanded into suburban Contra Costa County in the mid-1970s (especially after the opening of BART). In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==

AC Transit began operating local bus service under contract in central Contra Costa County in the 1970s after the coming of BART. Service began in Concord on September 8, 1975; in Pleasant Hill on December 8, 1975; and in Moraga and Orinda on September 13, 1976. Walnut Creek began operating a downtown shuttle route connecting to BART in December 1974.

On March 27, 1980, the Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (CCCTA) was created by a joint powers agreement between the cities of Clayton, Concord, Lafayette, Martinez, Moraga, Pleasant Hill, and Walnut Creek, plus the County of Contra Costa. The agency took over operations of the Walnut Creek system on July 1, 1980; by 1982, it had seven routes and twelve minibuses. The CCCTA originally planned to take over the other services in its district from AC Transit in August 1981. However, slow delivery of the buses and heavy rains that slowed construction of a maintenance facility delayed this until 1982. 

A Walnut Creek writer, Elizabeth Tenney, won a contest in early 1982 to create a slogan for the CCRTA system. Her slogan, &quot;The County Connection&quot;, was adopted as the system branding. The CCCTA took over local bus service in its district from AC Transit on June 7, 1982, with a fleet of 24 new Gillig buses. (AC Transit continued to operate express bus service that functioned as feeder service for BART.) At that time, the Walnut Creek routes had 2,500 daily riders, while the routes taken over from AC Transit had 8,000 daily riders. Several routes were consolidated with the takeover, while a new Martinez–Concord–Clayton route was added.

County Connection took over the operations of three private paratransit providers in 1990 to form its paratransit service, branded as LINK. In 1994, the agency took over the BART express bus feeder service.
== Service ==
As of May 2020, the County Connection operates 25 weekday routes (three of which also operate on weekends), seven weekend-only routes, and 19 school tripper routes within central Contra Costa County. All routes, with the exception of some of the &quot;600&quot;-numbered series select service trips, connect with regional train service, primarily BART, in addition to ACE in Pleasanton and Amtrak, including Amtrak California&#x27;s Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin services in Martinez. Among its 30 weekday routes, the County Connection operates seven express routes (Routes 91X—98X). With support from the city of Walnut Creek, the County Connection also operates a free downtown circulator with trolley livery (Route 4) with service between Walnut Creek and Broadway Plaza.

The fleet consists of 121 accessible buses and 63 paratransit vans.

=== Route overview ===

==== Weekdays ====
Weekday service is provided on all routes except &quot;300&quot;-numbered series routes, which operate only on weekends. &quot;600&quot;-numbered series routes are select service trips convenient to area schools and operate on school days, with service timed to school bell times.
==== Weekends ====
Service is provided on the following 11 routes:

<text>Utah Valley University (UVU) is a public university in Orem, Utah, United States. UVU offers master&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s, associate degrees, and certificates. Previously called Utah Valley State College, the school attained university status in July 2008. With an enrollment of over 44,000 students as of fall 2023, UVU is the largest university by enrollment in Utah and one of the largest in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States.

==History==
=== Central Utah Vocational School ===
The school was founded in the fall of 1941, when the Utah State Vocational Office consolidated federal work program classes into one campus in Provo, just west of the campus of Brigham Young University. At this time, the school was known as Central Utah Vocational School (CUVS).

=== Utah Trade Technical Institute ===
Growth brought numerous changes to the school over the following decades, and it was renamed several times to reflect its changing role. In 1963, the name was changed from CUVS to Utah Trade Technical Institute.

=== Utah Technical College at Provo ===

In 1967, the school became Utah Technical College in Provo (UTCP) and was given the authority to confer associate degrees for the first time. In 1977, the institution began moving to its present location, at the junction of I-15 and University Parkway in Orem.

=== Utah Valley Community College ===
In 1987, it became Utah Valley Community College.

=== Utah Valley State College ===
In 1993, the school was named UVSC and began awarding four-year degrees. The Utah legislature approved renaming UVSC as a university in February 2007 (effective July 1, 2008), allowing it to begin offering master&#x27;s degrees, although the school continues to emphasize its two- and four-year degree programs.

=== Utah Valley University ===
On July 1, 2008, UVSC changed to UVU, officially changing to a university. As of Fall Semester 2018, the Utah System of Higher Education (USHE) reported UVU as the largest university in the state for the fourth year in a row with 39,931 students, surpassing the University of Utah.

UVU is the largest employer in Orem, with over 1,900 full-time faculty and staff and over 3,300 part-time faculty and staff.

When it was a community college, the school had 8,000 students enrolled, and it was thriving and growing by approximately 3,000 students a year.
The university had 32,670 students enrolled for the 2010 fall semester. 31,556 students were enrolled for the fall of 2012.

Dr. Astrid S. Tuminez is the institution&#x27;s seventh president. She has been there since 2018 and is the university&#x27;s first female president. Tuminez was selected by the Utah State Board of Regents in 2018 and was preceded by Matthew S. Holland.

==Academics==
UVU is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. Individual programs, schools and colleges, and departments are accredited, certified, or recognized by 19 specialized accreditation agencies. Vocational accreditation was granted in 1976, and renewed in 1990 and 1995 by the Utah State Office of Vocational Education. In December 2006, the UVU School of Business received initial accreditation from the AACSB, which was maintained in 2011.

About 88% of UVU students come from Utah, but an increasing number of students come from other states and countries. In 2016, UVU students represented all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 74 countries.

UVU&#x27;s in-state tuition and fees cost roughly $5,530 (2016–17); out-of-state tuition and fees are $15,690 (2016–17).

UVU has a 100% acceptance rate. As of 2021, it holds a US ranking of #369 according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. For 2022, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UVU #94-#122 in Regional Universities West and #114 in Social Mobility for that region&#x27;s universities.

==Campuses==
UVU&#x27;s main campus is in Orem with satellite campuses in Heber City, Spanish Fork, North Orem, Provo Municipal Airport, and Lehi. UVU&#x27;s main campus encompasses and includes 48 buildings.

Each building has been built using the same style of exposed reinforced concrete with masonry infill walls (before 2005), with all of the major buildings on campus connected by concourses. UVU grounds include two reflecting ponds on the west side of campus, a stream running through the east part of campus, and a multi-dimensional fountain in the middle of campus.

UVU is home to the Utah Community Credit Union Center, formerly the David O. McKay Events Center which was built in 1996 with a capacity to seat 8,500 people. The events center is governed by a board of representatives from UVU, Utah County, and Orem City. It not only holds campus activities and sporting events but also community events such as major concerts, trade shows and expos, high school sports tournaments, family shows, graduations, and banquets. It is also home to UVU&#x27;s culinary arts program, including Restaurant Forte. On average, the Events Center hosts 150–170 events per year. As many as 360,000 people patronize the Events Center on an annual basis. &lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;40.279264&quot; longitude=&quot;-111.718254&quot; zoom=&quot;8&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;{

===Digital Learning Center===

In September 2006, the school began construction of a new Digital Learning Center to replace the Losee Resource Center (library). The &quot;DLC&quot; is and is located northeast of the Liberal Arts building. It opened on July 1, 2008. UVU President William A. Sederburg hired Cooper, Roberts, Simonsen and Associates, and Layton Construction as the design/build team for the new Digital Learning Center, with Jacob Alspector as lead architect. &quot;We chose the design we&#x27;re going with because it was an exceptional design that still kept a lot of the same features of our current campus. So it looks like it&#x27;s supposed to be there yet it stands out,&quot; said Jim Michaelis, associate vice president of Facilities Planning. The $48 million project includes networked computers, computer labs, a computer reference area (Information Commons), a media center, 31 study rooms, and wireless internet throughout the building. In 2016 money was donated to the Library by Ira A. Fulton and Mary Lou Fulton, and it was renamed Fulton Library.

The library is the &quot;greenest&quot; state-owned building in Utah and won two 2008 awards from Intermountain Construction magazine for its energy efficiency.

<text>Arthur William Carr (21 May 1893 – 7 February 1963) was an English cricketer. He played for the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and the English cricket team, captaining both sides.

==Cricket career==

A promising young batsman, Carr was given his first game of first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire in 1910, while still at school. He played well and was rewarded with the captaincy of Nottinghamshire in 1919.

Carr was selected for England&#x27;s tour of South Africa in 1922–23, and made his debut in the first Test against the South African cricket team. He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1923.

For the Ashes series against Australia in 1926, Carr was named captain of England. In the third Test at Leeds, he controversially put Australia into bat after winning the toss, and compounded it by dropping Charlie Macartney at slip in the first over of the match. Macartney scored a hundred before lunch and England were lucky to avoid defeat. He came down with tonsillitis during the fourth Test of the series, and although he recovered in time for the fifth Test, was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman. He was bitterly disappointed with this decision, and although he captained England twice more in his final two Tests against South Africa in 1929, from then on he put most of his effort into captaining Nottinghamshire into a dominant position within the English County cricket competition.

In 1930 and the following years, Carr was instrumental in developing the Bodyline bowling tactic together with future England captain Douglas Jardine and the two Nottinghamshire fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce. Carr used this tactic of instructing his bowlers to aim at the bodies of batsmen and placing a close set field on the leg side to take catches fended away from the body with the bat and perfected it as he led Nottinghamshire to success in the county competition. Jardine then used Larwood and Voce in similar fashion on the 1932–33 English tour of Australia, the tactic resulting in injuries to Australian batsmen and raising the ire of the Australian public.

After this tour and the subsequent fallout, Carr was subjected to Bodyline bowling by other English county teams, and was severely shaken by several balls that nearly hit him on the head. He denounced the tactic he had helped develop as unfair. Dissension within the Nottinghamshire club over his role in Bodyline led him being sacked as captain in 1934, and he never played first-class cricket again.

Carr played 11 Test matches, scoring 237 runs at an average of 19.75. His first-class career spanned 468 matches, and in this he made 21,051 runs at an average of 31.56 including 45 hundreds. He also bowled medium pace occasionally at first-class level, taking 31 wickets at an average of 37.09.

<doc id="819237" wikidata="Q2741732" url="?curid=819237" title="Northern Berber languages">
<text>The Northern Berber languages are a dialect continuum spoken across the Maghreb, constituting a subgroup of the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family. Their continuity has been broken by the spread of Arabic, and to a lesser extent by the Zenati group of Northern Berber. The Zenati idioms share certain innovations not found in the surrounding languages; notably a softening of &quot;k&quot; to &quot;sh&quot; and an absence of &quot;a-&quot; in certain words, such as &quot;hand&quot; (&quot;afus&quot; vs. &quot;fus&quot;.) 

Northern Berber languages spoken by over a million people include Shilha, Central Morocco Tamazight, Riff, Shawiya and Kabyle. They fall into three groups:

*Moroccan Atlas languages (incl. Shilha, Central Morocco Tamazight)
*Zenati languages (incl. Riff, Shawiya)
*Kabyle

The eastern boundaries of the North Berber varieties are uncertain. Some linguists include the Nafusi and Ghadames languages, while others do not. Most regard Ghadamès as lying outside of Northern Berber, but &quot;Ethnologue&quot; does not.

There is no authoritative answer as to whether the Northern Berber varieties constitute languages rather than dialects. Some academics believe that not only Northern Berber but all the Berber languages are dialects of a single language, whereas others come up with much higher counts. At any rate, mutual comprehensibility among the Northern Berber varieties is high, though not perfect.

<text>Edwin Lloyd Meeds (December 11, 1927August 17, 2005) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1965 to 1979. He represented the second district of Washington as a Democrat.

==Early years==
Born in Dillon, Montana, Meeds moved with his family to Monroe, Washington, northeast of Seattle, in 1944. He graduated from Monroe High school in 1946, served in the United States Navy from 1946 to 1947, and graduated from Everett Junior College in 1950. Meeds owned and operated a gas station until 1954, when he returned to school. He earned his law degree from Gonzaga University in Spokane in 1958, and passed the bar; he was a prosecutor, briefly in Spokane County, then in Snohomish County.

==Congress==
Meeds first won election to Congress in 1964 by defeating incumbent Republican Alfred Westland. Meeds won each of his subsequent bids for re-election with comfortable margins from 1966 up to 1974. In that year, when U.S. District Court Judge George Hugo Boldt ruled that treaties entitled Native Americans to half of the fish caught in their usual and customary fishing grounds, Meeds angered many of his constituents with his comment that the tribes had the law on their side and that people needed to move on. As a result, he won his 1976 reelection by only 542 votes, which led to his announcement in late 1977 that he would not seek re-election in he retired from the House and returned to practicing law in early 1979. His seat was won by former aide Al Swift.

While a congressman, Meeds was known for his work on conservation and education issues. He helped create the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area and the North Cascades National Park. A memorial to Meeds was erected in 2007 at the Snow Lake trailhead near Snoqualmie Pass, in honor of his work for the creation of Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Snow Lake lies within Alpine Lakes and is one of the most popular day-hike destinations in it. Harvey Manning describes Meeds&#x27; work in wilderness preservation efforts in his 2007 book &quot;Wilderness Alps: Conservation and Conflict in Washington&#x27;s North Cascades&quot; published by the North Cascades Conservation Council.

In contrast to his conservation efforts in Washington state, Meeds was central to efforts to limit land preservation in the bill that eventually became the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in December 1980. Following his retirement from the House in 1979, he became a Washington lobbyist and worked closely with the state of Alaska, Representative Don Young (R-AK), and the Citizens for the Management of Alaskan Lands to limit the scope of federal land preservation in Alaska in the final bill.

==Later life==
After his service in Congress ended in 1979, he stayed in the nation&#x27;s capital as a partner in the law firm of Preston Gates Ellis, &amp; Rouvelas Meeds, the D.C. office of Seattle-based Preston Gates &amp; Ellis.

==Death==
After a lengthy battle with lung cancer, Meeds died at age 77 at his home in Church Creek, Maryland, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife of 38 years, Mary Yang Meeds, and their daughter; he had two children from a previous marriage.

<text>In mathematics, the tombstone, halmos, end-of-proof, or Q.E.D. symbol &quot;∎&quot; (or &quot;□&quot;) is a symbol used to denote the end of a proof, in place of the traditional abbreviation &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; for the Latin phrase &quot;quod erat demonstrandum&quot;. It is inspired by the typographic practice of &quot;&quot;, an element that marks the end of an article.

In Unicode, it is represented as character . Its graphic form varies, as it may be a hollow or filled rectangle or square.

In AMS-LaTeX, the symbol is automatically appended at the end of a proof environment codice_1 ... codice_2. It can also be obtained from the commands codice_3, codice_4 or codice_5 (the latter causes the symbol to be right aligned).

It is sometimes called a &quot;Halmos finality symbol&quot; or &quot;halmos&quot; after the mathematician Paul Halmos, who first used it in a mathematical context in 1950. He got the idea of using it from seeing in magazines, that is, typographic signs that indicate the end of an article. In his memoir &quot;I Want to Be a Mathematician&quot;, he wrote the following:

<text>The Big Four is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by William Collins &amp; Sons on 27 January 1927 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. It features Hercule Poirot, Arthur Hastings, and Inspector Japp. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00.

The structure of the novel is different from other Poirot stories, as it began from twelve short stories (eleven in the US) that had been separately published. This is a tale of international intrigue and espionage, therefore opening up the possibility of more spy fiction from Christie.

== Development ==
In 1926 Christie was already deeply affected by the death of her mother earlier in the year and the breakdown of her marriage to Archibald Christie. Her brother-in-law, Campbell Christie, suggested that, rather than undergo the strain of composing a completely new novel, Christie should merely compile her most recent series of Poirot stories into a full length book. Campbell helped her revise the stories, which had been written for &quot;The Sketch&quot;, into a more coherent form for book publication. His assistance mainly took the form of revising the beginnings and ends of the stories to make them flow better into a novel – the substance of each story remains the same between the short story version and the novel version. Unlike the later &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; (1929), the order of the stories was retained.

Around this time, a novel was offered for publication to The Bodley Head and was rejected. No other information exists on this novel, but Zemboy suggests it was &quot;The Big Four&quot;. His theory continues with Christie&#x27;s relationship to her new publisher William Collins, Sons. Christie would have realized that &quot;The Big Four&quot; was an inferior novel and went to work writing &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; for the new publisher.

The book was published a few weeks after the disappearance and reappearance of Christie. The resulting publicity over her name caused the new novel to become a sales hit. Sales were good enough to more than double the success of &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;. It sold despite not being a traditional murder mystery, being a tale of international intrigue and espionage, and opening the possibility of more spy fiction from Christie.

In 1942, Christie wrote to her agent, Edmund Cork of Hughes Massie, asking him to keep a manuscript in reserve (probably &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;) and statedI have been, once, in a position where I &quot;wanted&quot; to write just for the sake of money coming in and when I felt I &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot; – it is a nerve wracking feeling. If I had had one MS &#x27;up my sleeve&#x27; it would have made a big difference. That was the time I had to produce that rotten book &quot;The Big Four&quot; and had to force myself in &quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
An unexpected visitor called Mayerling comes in through Hercule Poirot&#x27;s bedroom and collapses on the floor. The only clue to what he wants is his repeating Poirot&#x27;s name and address and writing the number 4, many times. When Hastings jokingly calls it &quot;The Mystery of the Big Four,&quot; the man begins speaking about an international crime cartel of that name. He describes the four leaders: Number 1 is a Chinese political mastermind named Li Chang Yen; Number 2 is probably American; Number 3 is a Frenchwoman; and Number 4 is known only as &quot;the Destroyer.&quot; The man dies soon after Poirot and Hastings go off on the trail of the Big Four.

From here, the novel becomes a series of loosely connected short stories.

* Poirot and Hastings visit an informant, John Ingles, to ask him about the Big Four. Ingles shows Poirot a note from a fisherman who asked him for a few hundred pounds to hide himself from the Big Four. Poirot, Hastings and Ingles discover that the man who wrote the note, a Mr Jonathan Whalley, has been murdered by Number 4.
* Poirot discovers that the Big Four have produced a form of wireless energy capable of focusing a beam of great intensity on any spot. A British scientist called Halliday was near success on this same concept when he was kidnapped while at a conference in France. Poirot and Hastings visit the notable French scientist Madame Olivier and discover she is Number 3.
* Poirot discovers that American millionaire Abe Ryland is Number 2 and sends Hastings to spy on him.
* Poirot investigates the death of a Mr Paynter in Worcestershire. Before his death, Paynter had written in ink &quot;yellow jasmine&quot; on his newspaper, and attempted to draw a number 4. Poirot reveals that Paynter&#x27;s attending physician, a Doctor Quentin, was in fact Number 4, who gave Paynter an injection of yellow jasmine.
* A month later, Japp informs Poirot of another mysterious death—that of chess grandmaster Gilmour Wilson, who died from heart failure while participating in a match with Russian refugee Doctor Savaronoff. Poirot deduces that the real Savaronoff died in Russia and that Number Four impersonated him, killing Wilson in order to preserve his cover.
* Hastings is kidnapped by the Big Four and Poirot saves him.
* Poirot identifies Number 4 as an obscure character actor called Claude Darrell. A former girlfriend reveals Darrell&#x27;s identifying quirks.
* In order to track the Big Four in secret, Poirot stages his own death. He and Hastings travel to the Big Four&#x27;s mountain hideout in Italy and are taken captive. Poirot reveals that he is not Hercule Poirot, but his twin brother, Achille. He tells the Big Four that the mountain has been cordoned off and the police are on the scene. Three of the Big Four are killed in an explosion just as the police raid the hideout. The other is reported to have committed suicide. Back home, Poirot reveals Achille Poirot did not exist – it was Hercule Poirot in disguise all along. He laments that all his other cases will seem boring and tame compared to this case. The novel ends with Hastings returning to Argentina and Poirot considering retirement.

==Characters==

=== Main===
*Hercule Poirot. The famous private investigator. Having tired of his life in England and dealing with trivial matters, he is tempted to move to Brazil. He has received a monetary offer too good to refuse.
*Arthur Hastings. Poirot&#x27;s sidekick in two earlier novels and two short stories. He briefly works as a secretary of Abe Ryland under the alias Arthur Nevill.
*Inspector Japp. He is an inspector of Scotland Yard.

=== The Big Four===
A multiethnic gang of four persons working towards world domination. They have a secret hideaway in a quarry of the Dolomites. It is owned by an Italian company which is a front company for Abe Ryland. The quarry conceals a vast subterranean base, hollowed out in the heart of the mountain. From there they use wireless communications to transfer orders to thousands of their followers across many countries. The characters comprise typical ethnic and national stereotypes of 1920s British fiction. They are:

*Abe Ryland - Number Two, the so-called American Soap King. He is stated to be richer than John D. Rockefeller and being the richest man in the world. Early in the novel, Ryland attempts to hire Poirot and invites him to Rio de Janeiro, allegedly to investigate the goings-on in a big company there. Poirot is offered a fortune and is tempted to accept. He eventually declines and the plot point is no longer elaborated. Presumably Ryland intended to recruit him for the organization. He dies when the hidden base of the Four explodes. He represents the power of wealth.
*Madame Olivier - Number Three, a French woman scientist. She is stated to be a famous nuclear physicist and analytical chemist. Poirot suspects that she has kept secret the true extent of her research with nuclear power. He believes that she has &quot;succeeded in liberating atomic energy and harnessing it to her purpose&quot;. She is said to have used gamma rays emitted by radium to perfect a lethal weapon. She is a widow. She used to work with her husband, conducting their research in common until his death. She is said to look more like a priestess out of the past than a modern woman. She dies when the hidden base of the Four explodes. She represents scientific research devoted to political goals.
*Li Chang Yen - Number One, the Chinese leader and mastermind of the group, said to have the finest criminal brain ever known. He is an unseen character who never sets foot out of China, but is discussed often by other characters. He controls a &quot;scientific force more powerful than the world has dreamed of&quot;. It is said that &quot;the men who loom most largely in the public eye are men of little or no personality. They are marionettes who dance to the wires pulled by a master hand, and that hand is Li Chang Yen&#x27;s&quot;. He is the power behind the throne of the East. He is the embodiment of Yellow Peril. His plots are said to include worldwide unrest, labour disputes in every nation, and revolutions in some of them. Elsewhere it is explained that he is a mandarin and lives in a palace of his own in Peking. He oversees human subject research on coolies, with no regard for the death and suffering of his research subjects. He commits suicide at the end. 
*Claude Darrell - Number Four, known as the Destroyer. He is an obscure English actor and a master of disguise. He is the chief assassin of the group. He appears with ever-changing faces and multiple identities throughout the novel. He can totally transform his physical appearance and his persona. Many of the novel&#x27;s characters are known or suspected to be among the roles Darrell plays. Darrell is described as being around 33 years old, brown-haired, having a fair complexion, gray-eyed. His height is given at . His origins are mysterious. Darrell has one weakness that can give his real identity away: when he dines, Darrell habitually rolls pieces of bread into little balls. He apparently dies when the hidden base of the Four explodes, though his body is unrecognisable. He is also effectively a spy and represents the secret services and intelligence agencies.

=== Others===
These characters are described by Zemboy. Most are also described by Bunson.
*Achille Poirot, Hercule&#x27;s supposed twin brother. Achille lacks a mustache and is described by Hercule as being less handsome. Achille is later revealed to be Hercule Poirot himself in disguise.
*Countess Vera Rossakoff. A flamboyant, eccentric and devious Russian aristocrat who currently has no personal fortune. She is employed as a secretary by Madame Olivier under the alias Inez Véroneau. She is both a friend and an adversary to Poirot.
*Joseph Aarons. A theatrical agent who helps Poirot identify actor Claude Darrell.
*John Halliday. A scientist who visited Paris for a conference and disappeared.
*John Ingles. A retired civil servant of reportedly mediocre intellect. He is an expert on China and all things Chinese. He informs Poirot of the identity of Li Chang Yen.
*Mr Mayerling. A former member of the Secret Service and a victim of the Big Four. He dies in Poirot&#x27;s apartment.
*Inspector Meadows. A representative of the Moretonhampstead police who investigates the death of Jonathan Whalley. He is an old friend of Inspector Japp who has recommended Poirot to him. He is willing to have Poirot involved in the case.
*Flossie Monro. An old friend of Claude Darrell. She has bleached blonde hair and a fondness for rouge and monogrammed shirts. She provides to Poirot information about a personal habit to Darrell that can be used to identify him, regardless of his disguise.
*Gerald Paynter. Nephew and heir to Mr Paynter. He is an artist, described as being &quot;wild and extravagant&quot;. Inspector Japp finds him typical for an artist. He inherits the estate of his deceased uncle.
*Dr Savaronoff. The world&#x27;s second-best chess player. Number Four masquerades as him in London, where he is challenged to a game by an American champion. 
*Mr Templeton. An older gentleman whose nurse suspects that he is being poisoned. Poirot realises that his son is actually Number Four.
*Jonathan Whalley. Another victim of the Big Four. He is murdered in his own residence, Granite Bungalow in the village of Hoppaton, Devon. He had written to John Ingles, requesting money to escape from the Big Four.
*Gilmour Wilson. A youthful American chess champion. He challenged Dr Savaronoff to a game and died while playing.

==Analysis==
Jerry Speir points out that the novel departs from the formula of the Hercule Poirot series. The novel is not set in the manor house or a rural area like a number of its predecessors, nor do the characters represent the British gentry. The villains are a gang of international criminals, controlling a secret, global organization. Their goals include the so-called disintegration of human civilization. They control an unspecified &quot;scientific force&quot;, a weapon of some kind. Speir speculates that they could hold the secrets to gravity or nuclear power.

Armin Risi agrees that this was to be the great case of Poirot&#x27;s life, as the character himself claims that all other cases will seem tame by comparison. Poirot does not track down a murderer; he must face and expose a supranational association of high-ranking personalities who are working towards world domination. Risi sees the book as a work of secret history which was inspired by the events and causes of World War I and the October Revolution (the novel was presumably written in 1924 or 1925; see the biographical remark below). The basic scenario of the novel has secret powers (the Four) influencing humanity and the course of history. To Risi it seems to be Agatha Christie&#x27;s warning about real-life organizations doing the same. He points out that Christie herself may not have been an objective historian. She was a member of the high society in the British Empire. But this fact possibly gave her access to first-hand observers of world politics and the secret affairs behind them. During the interwar period, World War I and the October Revolution were still significant topics of conversation. He theorizes that Christie may have learned of organizations of conspirators active in the era, at least those active in the City of London. There were already rumors that secret forces were planning World War II or even World War III.

James Zemboy observes that this novel lacks the unity of plot of a proper novel. It is a series of episodes, only unified by the theme of Hercule Poirot investigating and uncovering the identity of one of the villains. The Big Four themselves are unique characters, each one representing a personification of evil. But Zemboy finds these characters lacking in traits to make them amusing, engaging, or personally interesting. The minor characters are not unique. They are generic messengers or information providers. John Ingles serves only to provide information on Li Chang Yen, Flossie Monro is only significant in providing a single clue, and Sonia Daviloff only serves to show Poirot the position of the chess table.

Zemboy finds the book atypically boring for Christie. He believes that readers whose only exposure to her work is this novel, will be unlikely to pursue more of her books. The episodic nature of the book could have led to it being twice as long or half as long, without making any difference. The pattern of the novel is a series of dangerous encounters and failures to catch the criminals. Poirot repeatedly sets traps for the enemy. Repeatedly the enemy knows in advance and does not fall for them. On the other side, the Big Four set traps for Poirot. He evades most of them, only to find that the Four anticipated his moves as well. He does fall for some &quot;real&quot; traps.

Jeremy Black, a historian, points out that a number of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novels of the interwar period record the standard fears of affluent society in the era. She added the &quot;paranoid&quot; conviction of an underlying conspiracy. This is an element present in her literary work and absent in the adaptations of Agatha Christie for television and film.

Black adds that Christie&#x27;s work is, in its way, typical of the literature of the interwar period, much of which reflected a concern about foreign threats and links between domestic and international challenges. The Big Four, the characters, are positioned as the hidden cause and connecting threat between the world-wide unrest, labour disputes, and the revolutions of the period—in particular, the October Revolution, with Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky described as their puppets. The Big Four also have advanced technology in their arsenal.

=== Orientalism ===
Li Chang Yen is both a creature of sinister Orientalism and an echo of an earlier literary character: Fu Manchu by Sax Rohmer. The character was described as &quot;the greatest genius which the powers of evil have put on the Earth for centuries&quot;, the foe of the British Empire and British civilization in general. The character combined great cruelty with advanced scientific research. In &quot;The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu&quot; (1913), the eponymous character is presented as a figure behind Anti-Western actions in British Hong Kong and Chinese Turkestan. He is striking against Western politicians and administrators who are aware of the secret geopolitical importance of Tonkin, Mongolia, and Tibet, using these areas as a keyhole to the gate of the Indian Empire.

Fu Manchu&#x27;s agents were omnipresent even in England. His organization was likened to a yellow octopus with Fu Manchu as its head with dacoits and thugs as its tentacles. These agents killed secretly, swiftly, and leaving no clue behind. These were the literary predecessors of the Four and their agents.

David Suchet, who played Poirot for ITV from 1989 to 2013, had a different suggestion as to the origins of the Big Four. He found them to be an evil counterpart of &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; series by Edgar Wallace. He agrees, however, that Li Chang Yen was inspired by Fu Manchu.

==Literary significance and reception==
This novel was published a year after &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; (1926) and was overshadowed by its predecessor.

The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; review of the book publication struck a positive although incorrect note in its issue of 3 February 1927 when it assumed that the different style of the book from its immediate predecessor, &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, was a deliberate ploy: &quot;M. Poirot, the Belgian detective who has figured in others of Mrs Christie&#x27;s tales, is in very good form in the latest series of adventures. The device which made &#x27;Who killed Roger Ackroyd?&#x27; (sic) such a puzzling problem for the reader of detective fiction is one that a writer cannot easily employ a second time, and indeed the present story is not so much the clearing up of a mystery as a recital of Poirot&#x27;s encounters with one of those familiar groups of international crooks of almost unlimited power who seek to dominate the world.&quot; Hastings was described as &quot;dense as ever&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; of 2 October 1927 outlined the basics of the plot and stated Number Four&#x27; remains a mystery almost to the end. This, of course, makes it more difficult for the detective to guard against attack and to carry on his investigation, and it provides most of the thrills of the story.&quot;

The reviewer in &quot;The Observer&quot; of 13 February 1927 did not expect originality when reading a book dealing with the themes of &quot;The Big Four&quot;, but did admit that &quot;When one opens a book and finds the name Li Chang Yen and is taken to subterranean chambers in the East End &#x27;hung with rich Oriental silks&#x27;, one fears the worst. Not that Mrs Christie gives us the worst; she is far too adroit and accomplished a hand for that. But the short, interpolated mysteries within the mystery are really much more interesting than the machinations of the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; supermen.&quot; The conclusion of the book was &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;fails to be impressive&quot; and the reviewer summed up by saying, &quot;the book has its thrills – in fact, too many of them; it seeks to make up in its details what it lacks in quality and consistency.&quot;

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; of 17 March 1927 said, &quot;The activities of Poirot himself cannot be taken seriously, as one takes, for example, Sherlock Holmes. The book, indeed, reads more like an exaggerated parody of popular detective fiction than a serious essay in the type. But it certainly provides plenty of fun for the reader who is prepared to be amused. If that was the intention of the authoress, she has succeeded to perfection&quot;.

Robert Barnard: &quot;This thriller was cobbled together at the lowest point in Christie&#x27;s life, with the help of her brother-in-law. Charity is therefore the order of the day, and is needed, for this is pretty dreadful, and (whatever one may think of him as a creation) demeaning to Poirot.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Graphic novel===

&quot;The Big Four&quot; was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 3 December 2007, adapted and illustrated by Alain Paillou (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by Emmanuel Proust éditions in 2006 under the title of &quot;Les Quatre&quot;.

===Television===

The novel was adapted for television with David Suchet as Poirot, as part of the final series of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;. The film premiered on ITV on 23 October 2013 and on PBS on 27 July 2014 in the United States; it also guest-starred Sarah Parish, Patricia Hodge, Tom Brooke, Nicholas Burns, and Simon Lowe. Suchet&#x27;s former co-stars Hugh Fraser, Philip Jackson, and Pauline Moran reprised their roles as Hastings, Japp, and Miss Lemon. The episode is very loosely based on the novel, considered by writer Mark Gatiss to be &quot;an almost unadaptable mess&quot;.

<text>Monte Pascoal is a mountain to the south of the city of Porto Seguro, in the state of Bahia, Brazil. 

According to history, it was the first part of land viewed by Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, allegedly the first European to arrive in Brazil, in 1500. It was described as a tall, rounded mountain arising from the ocean. 

Monte Pascoal is a national symbol to Brazilians and gives its name to a national park, Parque Nacional do Monte Pascoal. The name &quot;Pascoal&quot; refers to &quot;Páscoa&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Easter&quot;), as the sighting of the mount happened around the date of that festival.

It is one of the locations where the old growth Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlântica) remains, and has been preserved.

<text>Alfred John &quot;Jack&quot; Westland (December 14, 1904 – November 3, 1982) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1953 to 1965. He represented the Second Congressional District of Washington as a Republican. He was also an accomplished amateur golfer.

Westland was born in Everett, Washington. He was elected to the House in 1952, taking the seat previously held by Democrat Scoop Jackson who had won election to the United States Senate. Westland was re-elected in 1954, 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1962. Westland voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He was defeated in 1964 by Democrat Lloyd Meeds. Westland subsequently moved to California, where he lived until his death in 1982.

==Golf career==
Westland was an accomplished amateur golfer for over 25 years. He won the 1929 French Amateur. He finished runner-up to Francis Ouimet in the 1931 U.S. Amateur. He won the 1933 Western Amateur and played on three Walker Cup teams (1932, 1934, 1953). He was also non-playing captain of the 1961 team. In 1952, at the age of 47, Westland won the U.S. Amateur over Al Mengert. He is the oldest golfer ever to win the Amateur.

Westland also won the Pacific Northwest Amateur four times (1938, 1939, 1940, 1951), the Washington State Amateur three times (1924, 1947, 1948) and the Chicago District Amateur three times (1927, 1929, 1934).

<text>Kew Gardens is a neighborhood in the central area of the New York City borough of Queens. Kew Gardens is bounded to the north by the Union Turnpike and the Jackie Robinson Parkway, to the east by the Van Wyck Expressway and 131st Street, to the south by Hillside Avenue, and to the west by Park Lane, Abingdon Road, and 118th Street. Forest Park is to the west and the neighborhood of Forest Hills to the north-west, Flushing Meadows–Corona Park north, Richmond Hill south, Briarwood southeast, and Kew Gardens Hills east.

Kew Gardens is located in Queens Community District 9 and its ZIP Code is 11415. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 102nd Precinct. Politically, Kew Gardens is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 29th District.

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Kew Gardens was one of seven planned garden communities built in Queens from the late 19th century to 1950. Much of the area was acquired in 1868 by Englishman Albon P. Man, who developed the neighborhood of Hollis Hill to the south, chiefly along Jamaica Avenue, while leaving the hilly land to the north undeveloped.

Maple Grove Cemetery on Kew Gardens Road opened in 1875. A Long Island Rail Road station was built for mourners in October and trains stopped there from mid-November. The station was named Hopedale, after Hopedale Hall, a hotel located at what is now Queens Boulevard and Union Turnpike. In the 1890s, the executors of Man&#x27;s estate laid out the Queens Bridge Golf Course on the hilly terrains south of the railroad. This remained in use until it was bisected in 1908 by the main line of the Long Island Rail Road, which had been moved to the south to eliminate a curve. The golf course was then abandoned and a new station was built in 1909 on Lefferts Boulevard. Man&#x27;s heirs, Aldrick Man and Albon Man Jr., decided to lay out a new community and called it at first Kew and then Kew Gardens after the well-known botanical gardens in England. The architects of the development favored English and neo-Tudor styles, which still predominate in many sections of the neighborhood.

=== Urbanization ===
In 1910, the property was sold piecemeal by the estate and during the next few years streets were extended, land graded and water and sewer pipes installed. The first apartment building was the Kew Bolmer at 8045 Kew Gardens Road, erected in 1915; a clubhouse followed in 1916 and a private school, Kew-Forest School, in 1918. In 1920, the Kew Gardens Inn at the railroad station opened for residential guests, who paid $40 a week for a room and a bath with meals. Elegant one-family houses were built in the 1920s, as were apartment buildings such as Colonial Hall (1921) and Kew Hall (1922) that numbered more than twenty by 1936.

In July 1933, the Grand Central Parkway opened from the Kew Gardens Interchange to the edge of Nassau County. Two years later, the Interboro (now Jackie Robinson) Parkway was opened, linking Kew Gardens to Pennsylvania Avenue in East New York. Since the parkways used part of the roadbed of Union Turnpike, no houses were demolished.

Around the same time, the construction of the Queens Boulevard subway line offered the possibility of quick commutes to the central business district in Midtown Manhattan. In the late 1920s, speculators, upon learning the route of the proposed line, quickly bought up property on and around Queens Boulevard, and real estate prices soared, and older buildings were demolished in order to make way for new development. In order to allow for the speculators to build fifteen-story apartment buildings, several blocks were rezoned. They built apartment building in order to accommodate the influx of residents from Midtown Manhattan that would desire a quick and cheap commute to their jobs. Since the new line had express tracks, communities built around express stations, such as in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens became more desirable to live. With the introduction of the subway into the community of Forest Hills, Queens Borough President George U. Harvey predicted that Queens Boulevard would become the &quot;Park Avenue of Queens&quot;. With the introduction of the subway, Forest Hills and Kew Gardens were transformed from quiet residential communities of one-family houses to active population centers. The line was extended from Jackson Heights–Roosevelt Avenue to Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike on December 30, 1936.

Following the line&#x27;s completion, there was an increase in the property values of buildings around Queens Boulevard. For example, a property along Queens Boulevard that would have sold for $1,200 in 1925, would have sold for $10,000 in 1930. Queens Boulevard, prior to the construction of the subway, was just a route to allow people to get to Jamaica, running through farmlands. Since the construction of the line, the area of the thoroughfare that stretches from Rego Park to Kew Gardens has been home to apartment buildings, and a thriving business district that the Chamber of Commerce calls the &quot;Golden Area&quot;.

===Later years===
Despite its historical significance, Kew Gardens lacks any landmark protection.

On November 22, 1950, two Long Island Rail Road trains collided in Kew Gardens. The trains collided between Kew Gardens and Jamaica stations, killing 78 people and injuring 363. The crash became the worst railway accident in LIRR history, and one of the worst in the history of New York state.

In 1964, the neighborhood gained news notoriety when Kitty Genovese was murdered near the Kew Gardens Long Island Rail Road station. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported that none of the neighbors responded when she cried for help. The story came to represent the apathy and anonymity of urban life. The circumstances of the case are disputed to this day. It has been alleged that the critical fact reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;none of the neighbors responded&quot; was false. The case of Kitty Genovese is an oft-cited example of the bystander effect, and the case that originally spurred research on this social psychological phenomenon.

==Land use==
Kew Gardens remains a densely populated residential community, with a mix of one-family homes above the million-dollar range, complex apartments, co-ops and others converted and on the way or being converted as condominiums. A new hotel has been completed on 82nd Avenue, reflecting a modernization of the area. However, it is filled mainly with apartment buildings between four and ten stories high; while many are rentals, some are Housing cooperatives (co-ops). Although there are no New York City Housing Authority complexes in Kew Gardens, Mitchell-Lama buildings provide stabilized rental prices for families or individuals who may need help paying rent. On 83rd Avenue there is a 32-story Mitchell-Lama building. Along the borders of Richmond Hill, Briarwood, and Jamaica, smaller attached houses exist. Many of these are two or three family homes. Expensive single family homes are located around the Forest Park area. However, many owners are selling out their detached homes to developers who teardown and convert them into apartment housing or more expensive, lavish mini-estate houses. This has brought demographic change.

The neighborhood also has many airline personnel because of its proximity to the MTA&#x27;s bus line to John F. Kennedy International Airport, as well as to Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways and other airlines&#x27; special shuttles that serve pilots and flight attendants staying in Kew Gardens.

Kew Gardens&#x27;s commercial center is Lefferts Boulevard between Austin Street and Metropolitan Avenue. Major attractions include the Kew Gardens Cinemas, a 1930s art deco movie theater that has been converted into a six-screen multiplex and shows a mix of commercial, independent, and foreign films. Lefferts is also home to the only bookstore in central Queens, Kew &amp; Willow Books.

=== Points of interest ===
Forest Park is the third largest park in Queens and is located to the west of Kew Gardens. The Wisconsin Glacier retreated from Long Island some 20,000 years ago, leaving behind the hills that now are part of Forest Park. The park was home to the Rockaway, Delaware and Lenape Native Americans until Dutch West India Company settlers arrived in 1634 and began establishing towns and pushing the tribes out. The park contains the largest continuous oak forest in Queens. Inside the park, the Forest Park Carousel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

In addition to Maple Grove Cemetery, the Ralph Bunche House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a designated National Historic Landmark.

The county&#x27;s civic center, Queens Borough Hall, along with one of the county criminal courts, stand at the northern end of the neighborhood, on Queens Boulevard, in a complex extending from Union Turnpike to Hoover Avenue. Adjacent to Borough Hall is a retired New York City Subway R33 (Redbird) which lies on a fake track as well as a platform. Visitors used to be able to go inside the car, but it was closed in 2015 due to lack of visitors.

Kew Gardens is ethnically diverse. A large community of Jewish refugees from Germany took shape in the area after the Second World War which is reflected still today by the number of active synagogues in the area. The neighborhood attracted many Chinese immigrants after 1965, about 2,500 Iranian Jews arrived after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and immigrants from China, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Israel, the former Soviet Union, India, Bangladesh and Korea settled in Kew Gardens during the 1980s and 1990s. Currently, Kew Gardens has a growing population of Bukharian Jews from Uzbekistan, alongside a significant Orthodox Jewish community. Also many immigrants from Central America, and South America call Kew Gardens home, as well as immigrants from Japan.

The increase of the Korean population followed the renovation and rededication of the First Church of Kew Gardens, which offers Korean-language services. In recent years, young professionals and Manhattanites looking for greenery, park-like atmosphere and spacious apartments have moved to the area.

Major development in the neighborhood, such as the construction of new apartment complexes and multi-family homes, has resulted in great demographic change as well. Immigrants from Latin America, Guyana, South Asia and East Asia, and the Middle East (especially Israel), have moved into these new developments. Even the local cuisine reflects this diversity in Kew Gardens, with Russian, Italian, Indian, Pakistani, and Uzbek dining available to residents and visitors. Many religious groups such as Jews, Muslims, and Hindus, can shop at local markets and bazaars that cater to their religious-food needs.

==Economy==
Kew Gardens has many locally owned businesses and restaurants especially on Lefferts Boulevard, Metropolitan Avenue, Austin Street, and Kew Gardens Road. The courthouse is very profitable, as is transportation to the area; however, neither profit the neighborhood directly, but instead serve as an incentive to move to the area. The cost of living in the neighborhood (as of 2015) is $62,900. Pilots and flight attendants who stay in Kew Gardens in between John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport flights also affect the local economy.

Saudi Arabian Airlines operates an office in Suite 401 at 80–02 Kew Gardens Road in Kew Gardens.

<text>Arcee is a robot character in the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise, an Autobot usually pink or blue in color. She has made more appearances and has had several more incarnations than any other female Transformer. Arcee&#x27;s design, alternate mode, and personality vary depending on continuity.

==Transformers: Generation 1==

Arcee is a female Autobot warrior who turns into a pink convertible. She was voiced by Susan Blu.

===Animated series===
Although a group of Female Autobots (not including Arcee) had already been featured in one episode of the original cartoon series, Arcee quickly became the best-known due to her position as a recurring cast member following her introduction in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; (1986). Susan Blu would go on to be involved in several more &quot;Transformers&quot;-related shows as voice director, even reprising her role as Arcee in . Arcee was a gunner and was depicted as being an excellent marksman. In the season 3 introduction, &quot;Five Faces of Darkness&quot;, she accompanies Springer on a mission to track down a sleezoid ship. The mission eventually reunites them with Grimlock and Rodimus Prime. They also go onto rescue Ultra Magnus, Kup and Spike Witwicky from the clutches of the Quintessons.

Arcee would appear sporadically over the course of the season, and even kept her main character status into the fourth season dubbed &quot;The Rebirth&quot;. She was a major player in &quot;Dark Awakening&quot;, being among the crew zombie Optimus Prime betrayed aboard the mausoleum. And, in &quot;Dweller in the Depths&quot;, she is seen fighting back against Springer when he is turned into an energy vampire.
In the episode &quot;Only Human&quot;, Ultra Magnus, Springer, Rodimus Prime and Arcee found their minds transferred into human-mimicking &quot;synthoid&quot; bodies by the human crime lord Victor Drath.

In the final three episodes of the U.S. television series, when the Decepticons successfully stole the key to the Plasma Energy Chamber and opened the ancient device, a group of Autobots and humans - including Arcee and Daniel Witwicky - were blasted across the galaxy by the energy release, crash-landing on the planet Nebulos. Quickly siding with a group of rebels engaged in a war against the planet&#x27;s evil rulers, the Hive, they deduced a process by which they could combine the best of their minds and bodies together, becoming Headmasters. While the other Autobot Headmasters combined with Nebulons, Daniel became Arcee&#x27;s Headmaster partner.

In the Japanese television series &quot;Transformers: The Headmasters&quot;, the events of the last three episodes of the U.S. series were ignored. Although Headmasters were introduced, they had a vastly different origin. Arcee did not become a Headmaster, but was a regular on this series, appearing in most of the episodes, from episode 1 &quot;Four Warriors Come Out of The Sky&quot; to episode 35 &quot;The Final Showdown On Earth Part 2&quot;.

In the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; episode &quot;Transmutate&quot;, Rattrap referred to Arcee as his great aunt: &quot;What in the name of my great aunt Arcee is going on!?&quot; The character Transmutate was coincidentally voiced by Susan Blu, who also voiced Arcee.

===Books===
Arcee appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book &quot;The Lost Treasure of Cybertron&quot; by Marvel Books.

===Comics===

====3H Enterprises====
&quot;Transformers: Universe Wreckers&quot; #1 starts with a flashback to late in the original cartoon series, where Daniel Witwicky and Wheelie are killed. This puts Daniel&#x27;s friend Arcee into a sad state. The main story is set in the later episodes of &quot;Beast Machines&quot;. Arcee, now a Maximal Valkyrie with a spider beast mode, joins the Wreckers, though initially she proves unwilling. The Predacon Fractyl speaks with her after the rest of the group leaves, but is then almost killed by the Vehicons, and Arcee saves his life by sharing her Spark with him, converting him into a new body in the process. The two then rejoin the rest of the team and flee Cybertron in an Autobot shuttle, which unbeknownst to them has been boarded by Devcon. A confrontation with him leaves Fractyl dangerously wounded, and Arcee takes him to receive medical care. She and the other Wreckers are then betrayed by Cyclonus, who had infiltrated the team in service to the Predacon criminal Cryotek.

According to the script for the unreleased issue #4 of &quot;Transformers: Universe - The Wreckers&quot; the Wreckers returned to Cybertron where they helped repel an invasion by the Quintessons.

====Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing====

Arcee appeared in the Devil&#x27;s Due third series of &quot;G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers&quot;. Grimlock, Arcee, Bumblebee, and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on Earth. When Cobra attacked the base, the Autobots helped repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. However, Cobra Commander was able to infiltrate the base and awaken the special project the government was working on - SerpentO.R, a cyborg created using DNA from many great warleaders and parts from Megatron. SerpentO.R. promptly turned on him and escaped to Cybertron via Spacebridge. The Autobots and a team of G.I. Joes led by Hawk pursued him. During this an attraction had been growing between Arcee and Bumblebee. This led to Bumblebee&#x27;s death at the hands of SerpentO.R as well as the capture of the group. Freed by Snake Eyes, Arcee was part of the assault to rescue Prime and proved instrumental in SerpentO.R&#x27;s (now controlled by Cobra Commander) defeat, ripping his chest piece off and allowing Hawk to reach the Matrix, opening it and putting Cobra Commander in a coma. Arcee was seen mourning Bumblebee at the end.

====Dreamwave Productions====
During the years when Shockwave united most of Cybertron, Arcee was in a resistance group to his rule along with Kup, Blaster, Hot Rod and Wheelie. After Shockwave&#x27;s defeat, Arcee joined Ultra Magnus in trying to fortify one of Cybertron&#x27;s moons – but her affections were the subject of a feud between Hot Rod and Springer.

====IDW Publishing====
It is revealed in IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Spotlight&quot; issue that Arcee was a part of Jhiaxus&#x27;s experiments to introduce gender into the Cybertronian species. Arcee was his first test-subject and her creation was due to Jhiaxus altering with her CNA. According to Arcee she did not measure up to Jhiaxus&#x27;s ideals and was abandoned.

Unlike her other versions, this Arcee, while still an Autobot by allegiance, is a violent, antisocial killer who is imprisoned by the other Autobots at Garrus 9 for her actions. Released by a reluctant Fortress Maximus during a Decepticon attack to buy time for Jetfire&#x27;s team to get rid of the Monstructor components, her power level appears much higher than a normal Autobot, as she is seen taking on all of the Combaticons single handed and winning, although unable to stop their kidnapping of the Monstructor components due to a teleporter based escape plan. She is classified as a &quot;level 9&quot; threat, the only Autobot of that power level present in the prison during the assault. Realizing there is a link between her and the Monstructor Transformers, as they were all created by Jhiaxus, Maximus and Jetfire release her to track them down.

Throughout the &quot;Revelations&quot; arc, Arcee hunts for Jhiaxus to get her revenge, finally confronting him in &quot;Spotlight: Sideswipe&quot;. She is informed by Hardhead that Jhiaxus cannot be destroyed forever as he is bound to the Dead Universe; she is pleased by this, as it means she has the chance to kill him, over and over, forever.

In &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, it is revealed that she and Hardhead had remained on Garrus Prime to guard the portal to the Dead Universe and continue torturing Jhiaxus. When the D-Void called the entire population of the planet into the portal to feed on, Arcee was overwhelmed, but Hardhead, vaccinated against the call by his exposure to dead universe energy during revelations, held her back until the portal closed. Since then, they had been exploring the remains of a mysterious dead civilization uncovered by the portal closing. When Galvatron and the seekers arrived to investigate, Arcee and Hardhead engaged them and despite initial success including the severe wounding of Galvatron, became outmatched when Galvatron used the Heart of Darkness to heal himself and attack them, and Hardhead told her to run and get help. Cyclonus blasted a bridge out from under her, and left her for dead, but she was later seen pulling herself back out of the pit.

Later on, Arcee joins with Prowl, becoming his personal assassin whom he deploys to murder Ratbat in order to keep peace on a post-war Cybertron. Prowl dispatches her to kill several more Decepticons, however some of these deaths are faked as a part of a conspiracy to rile up the many Decepticons on Cybertron into a frenzy against the provisional Autobot government. It is later revealed that Prowl has been under mind control by the Insecticon Bombshell since shortly after having Ratbat killed. Prowl is subsequently forced to become a part of a new Devastator under Bombshell&#x27;s control. During this, Arcee appears to be loyal to the Decepticons, but once Devastator is unleashed on Cybertron, she kills Bombshell to sever his link with Prowl, enabling the newly formed Autobot combiner Superion to temporally overpower him.

Following the Decepticons&#x27; defeat, Starscream takes command of the neutral population of Cybertron, and banishes Autobot and Decepticon alike from the small city built in the aftermath of the war. Arcee leaves with Prowl and the Autobots, eventually joining them officially by carving their insignia into her shoulder.

A later retcon in the series revealed that Arcee&#x27;s memory of her forced gender transition by Jhiaxus was &quot;a lie [she] told [herself].&quot; In Optimus Prime #25, Arcee admits that she is transgender, and sought out Jhiaxus to &quot;restore&quot; gender to Cybertronian society, after it was suppressed in ancient times. Her rage was explained as self-loathing, disgust for who Jhiaxus truly was, and fear that her old friends would reject her if they knew she wanted to be female.

====Marvel Comics====
&quot;All stories exclusive to Marvel UK are in italics&quot;

Arcee was absent from the U.S. Marvel Comics (barring the adaptation of the movie), because the comics had established that in their continuity, Transformers did not possess sexes, thus Arcee&#x27;s presence as a clearly female robot would have defied this.

Arcee also makes an appearance twice in the American &quot;Transformers: Headmasters #1&quot; as a background character in Fortress Maximus&#x27; regiment. In order to explain any Autobots introduced during the fourth (then-ongoing) and fifth production years, most of Fortress Maximus&#x27;s crew on Cybertron and aboard the Steelhaven were unseen, or used generic bodies until readers were &quot;surprised&quot; with them later.

Arcee would appear in the UK Marvel comic issue #234, &quot;Prime&#x27;s Rib!&quot; This story is set in the near future, 1995, where Optimus Prime, Jazz and Hot Rod introduce the latest Autobot, Arcee, to the human feminists. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by Shockwave, Fangry, Horri-Bull and Squeezeplay, who thought the Autobot would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.

The UK comic also set a number of stories directly after the events of the movie. The &quot;Space Pirates&quot; arc saw Arcee skip guard duty at Autobot City; her dereliction of duty led directly the fall of Autobot City to the Quintessons. She was then used as bait in a Quintesson trap to claim the Creation Matrix from Rodimus Prime. Arcee achieved some measure of redemption by aiding Rodimus Prime, now reduced in power to his &quot;Hot Rod&quot; form, in his bid to reclaim Autobot City by activating Metroplex.

Arcee later joined Rodimus Prime&#x27;s time-travelling party, helping in the fight against Galvatron during the &quot;Time Wars&quot;. Arcee and the other future Autobots returned to find their own time-stream changed to a different, darker future, where Galvatron was alive and ruling most of Cybertron.

Arcee appeared among the Autobots under the command of Rodimus Prime in the alternate future story &quot;Aspects of Evil 2&quot; from Marvel UK Transformers #224. In this story, Rodimus Prime remembered how Galvatron, Crankcase, Ruckus and Windsweeper killed Blurr and then attacked Rodimus Prime, Kup, Arcee and the Battle Patrol. Enraged, Rodimus nearly killed Galvatron, but to keep the Matrix from being contaminated by hatred he relented.

Arcee appeared in Marvel UK Transformers #251 &quot;The Void!&quot; where she was among the Autobot crew of a ship commanded by Rodimus Prime which was retreating from Cybertron.

====TFcon comics====
Arcee appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play &quot;Bee for, Bee now&quot;.

Arcee appeared in &quot;Lil Formers&quot; #93, &quot;Fembots&quot; by Matt Moylan, where she co-hosted a television talk show series.

===Toys===
* &quot;Generation 1&quot; Headmaster Arcee (unreleased)
:Like all the new characters in the movie (with the exception of Ultra Magnus), Arcee was designed for animation first, but while the other new characters inspired toys that saw final release, Arcee&#x27;s design never passed early prototype stages for unknown reasons. When she became a Headmaster, Takara dallied with the idea of repainting the Chromedome toy to represent her, but the suggestion was abandoned. A few pictures of prototypes have appeared online. In robot mode, Daniel would have been able to turn into Arcee&#x27;s head, in vehicle mode he would have formed the front of the car.
* &quot;Heroes of Cybertron&quot; Arcee (2001)
: A non-transforming &quot;Heroes of Cybertron&quot; G1 Arcee was released in 2001. It was later repainted as &quot;Paradron Medic&quot;.
* &quot;Beast Machines&quot; BotCon Arcee (2001)
: In 2001, Arcee finally received a toy in the form of an exclusive for the 2001 BotCon convention. The toy itself was a recolored version of the previous year&#x27;s Transmetals 2 Blackarachnia toy, and some packaging featured a new sound clip recorded by Susan Blu.
* &quot;Binaltech&quot; BT-21 Arcee Featuring Honda S2000 Hardtop (2008)
: A redeco of Alternators Decepticharge in Honda&#x27;s Pearl White color, with Arcee&#x27;s traditional pink accents in robot mode. She retains Decepticharge&#x27;s head sculpt and removable hardtop accessory; however, as a Japanese Binaltech release, she has the full length gun barrel seen with Overdrive, instead of Decepticharge&#x27;s truncated one. This figure never saw a U.S. release, as Hasbro canceled the &quot;Alternators&quot; line years prior.
* &quot;Generations Thrilling 30&quot;/Legends LG-10 Arcee (2014/2015)
: Arcee finally received a toy faithful to her animation model as part of the &quot;Generations&quot; Thrilling 30 toyline in 2014. A new-mold toy, it comes with a pair of translucent blue swords paying homage to her &quot;Animated&quot; and IDW counterparts, as well as a pair of guns; all four can be stored on her in vehicle mode. The toy was released in Japan by Takara Tomy as part of the &quot;Legends&quot; toyline, albeit redecoed to better resemble her cartoon counterpart.

* &quot;War For Cybertron: Earthirse/Kingdom&quot; Arcee (2020/2021)
: A new toy of Arcee was released as part of the second wave of Earthrise deluxe class figures and later re-released in the second wave of the Kingdom deluxe class figures. This Arcee is based mostly on her G1 cartoon appearance but she is lacking painted lips. Fans criticized her transformation as basically a robot under a car body. The lower piece of her car mode can be detached to be used as a hoverboard or for a slimmer profile. She also comes with a clear pistol. Arcee was later repainted and remolded into Lifeline and War For Cybertron Netflix Elita-1.

==Unicron Trilogy==

===Transformers: Armada===
The first reuse of the name Arcee was in Japan. In 2003, the name Arcee was given to the Mini-Con known in America as Sureshock (leading to some debate on the Mini-Con&#x27;s gender - the Dreamwave Comics would later identify Sureshock as female, but the tech specs for &quot;Transformers: Cybertron&quot; Sureshock would refer to it as male). Sureshock was even repainted in pink and white colors in Japan as &quot;X-Dimension Arcee&quot;.

===Transformers: Energon===

In &quot;&quot;, Arcee had a wide-release original mold made in homage to the original character. In the &quot;Energon&quot; storyline, the character Arcee was a female Omnicon who transformed into a motorcycle and used an energon crossbow. She was created to be a leader for the Omnicons and, as such, was the only Omnicon to have a unique name and body-type. In Japan the toy and character were named Ariel, a name used by the female transformer who was the &quot;girlfriend&quot; of Orion Pax in the original series&#x27;s episode &quot;War Dawn&quot;; this Ariel would later become Elita One.

In the original Japanese series &quot;Superlink&quot;, it is said Ariel took the form of a woman as a symbol of care, who protects all soldiers.

===Animated series===
This incarnation of Arcee was a member of the Omnicons, a race and faction of robots exclusive to this fictional universe of Transformers. Larger than Mini-Cons, they can carry passengers and process raw energon to create tools, weapons, or energon stars. Omnicons were a main group of characters &quot;&quot; series allied with the Autobots. They were opposition of to the Decepticon allied Terrorcons.

While Omnicons were formerly Autobots and Decepticons, these two sides set aside their differences and left Cybertron with Team Rodimus. The Omnicons eventually began working together to mine Energon, the energy-rich mineral needed to power Transformers and their technology. Invaluable to the Transformers because of their unique ability to handle, shape and process raw energon, which is damaging to normal Transformers, the Omnicons created the Cybertron cities as only they can. There are three distinct body types shared among the Omnicon ranks, but unlike the Terrorcons, each Omnicon possesses an individual mind of his own.

Additionally, there is one other Omnicon body-type - that of the unique Omnicon leader, Arcee. Transforming into a motorcycle and wielding an Energon crossbow, she arrived in the middle of Megatron&#x27;s attack on Cybertron, guiding the Omnicon forces into subduing Unicron&#x27;s hunger. She was soon frequently partnered with Kicker on the battlefield.

All of the Omnicon toys, including Arcee, were redecoed and released as Target store exclusives for the 2007 Transformers movie. The new colors are designed to look more like a real vehicle would be painted, in keeping with the theme of the movie.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Arcee also appeared in the Dreamwave Productions &quot;Transformers: Energon&quot; comics, as one of the four Omnicons watched over by the Mini-Con Over-Run.

Arcee would first appear in issue #19, being introduced to Optimus Prime by Over-Run as the first of the new species—the Omnicons. Subsequently, assigned to Earth for training, they managed to annoy their commander Hot Shot beyond reason but subsequently apprehended Snow Cat. Arcee would have further adventures battling Mirage, Sharkticon and Slugslinger to protect Kicker, eventually defeating them with Kicker&#x27;s help.

===Fun Publications===
Arcee appeared in the text story from Fun Publications called &quot;Force of Habit&quot;. This story explained where she was during the events of the &quot;Cybertron&quot; story. Ultra Magnus was the commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys. Arcee served as captain of the &quot;Azusa&quot; which was sent to Gamma Serpentis.

===Toys===
* &quot;Energon&quot; Basic Arcee
:In 2005, &quot;Energon&quot; Arcee was repackaged for the &quot;Transformers: Universe&quot; toy line, although the character has not appeared in the &quot;Universe&quot; storyline. This toy was identical to the &quot;Energon&quot; release, but in &quot;Universe&quot; packaging.
:The Arcee/Ariel toy (Arcee&#x27;s main color was salmon-pink, while Ariel&#x27;s was Japanese pink) was later repainted green and aqua as the Aerial Paradron Type in Japan, in the colors of Generation 1 Paradron Medic. She was again repainted (black) as &quot;&quot; Flamewar and her head remolded as &quot;Transformers: Timelines&quot; Chromia and Flareup.
==Transformers Cinematic Universe==

Arcee was initially set to be in the 2007 &quot;Transformers&quot; film and had a very positive fan reaction, but because there was not enough time in the movie to explain the presence of a &quot;female&quot; in a robotic race, she was dropped from the script and replaced with Ironhide. Before she was dropped, her alternate mode was stated to be a Buell Firebolt motorcycle; concept art by Ben Procter can be seen on his website. Even though Arcee was not in the movie, a motorcycle was used by Captain William Lennox to attack Blackout (although the bike was an Aprilia RSV 1000 R rather than a Buell). Arcee was also initially set to battle Blackout in the movie. According to the Hasbro 2007 movie toy&#x27;s tech spec for Arcee, she received combat training from Ironhide. Arcee is armed with a machine gun.

According to the biography printed in the collected &quot;Reign of Starscream&quot; books, Arcee was once a member of the Autobot science team who had to adapt her skills when the war broke out.

According to the biography for the &quot;Revenge of the Fallen&quot; Chromia toy, she is a sister to Chromia and Elita One. She is an unusual Cybertronian as she and her sisters (Chromia and Elita One) are controlled by one mind, allowing them to attack with extremely precise timing. According to the biography for her 2009 movie toy she commands her team. Writer Roberto Orci has stated he intended the three motorcycles to be a single mind, but Michael Bay portrayed them as individuals just like the Hasbro bios. According to Hasbro, Arcee is only about 7 feet tall but on the scale for the first film it was stated she was 9 feet tall.

===IDW Publishing===
In &quot;Transformers: Defiance&quot; #1, back on ancient Cybertron, Arcee was among Optimus Prime&#x27;s crew at an excavation site near the temple at Simfur where an artifact was uncovered. In issue #2, Arcee helped in the recovery effort after the attack on Cybertron. She later sided with Optimus Prime against Megatron&#x27;s orders to counter-attack their invaders. In issue #4, Arcee, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Jazz and Smokescreen ambushed Ironhide, who they believed worked for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joined Optimus Prime&#x27;s Autobots. Arcee and Bumblebee later spied on the building of the Decepticon starship Nemesis.

Although Arcee was not in the film, the character still appeared in the comic book &quot;&quot; where she fights as part of Bumblebee&#x27;s squad. She realized that Bumblebee knew more than he was revealing, but likewise said nothing when their squad was captured and tortured by the Decepticons.

In &quot;Reign of Starscream&quot; the Decepticon Starscream barely made it to the Nemesis on Mars before he ran out of power. His return was noted by the Autobot Cosmos, who alerted Arcee, Cliffjumper, Smokescreen, Camshaft and Air Raid. Aided by Thundercracker on the Nemesis Starscream recovered and sent the information Frenzy had gathered back to Cybertron just as Hardtop spotted the Autobots closing on the Nemesis. Arcee appears on the cover of issue #3. In issue #4, Arcee returned to Cybertron from Mars by hiding in the landing gear of Starscream&#x27;s ship. Once on the planet she was discovered by a Dreadwing and Payload drone, who she deactivated. Returning to an Autobot training facility she discovered Clocker, who took her to Crosshairs who was planning an attack to free the Autobots at Simfur, which they attempted with the aid of Wingblade, Skyblast, Breakaway and Strongarm.

In &quot;Tales of the Fallen&quot; #6 Arcee is taken by Thundercracker and given to the Decepticon medic Flatline, who experiments on her. Upon waking up she discovers Skids and Mudflap are also captives of the Decepticons. After she discovers her spark has been merged with that of Chromia and Elita One, they have a mental link, and use this to lead an escape. Arcee, Chromia and Elita One subsequently were among the Autobots to come to Earth in response to Optimus Prime&#x27;s signal inviting all of his kind to come there. She joined with the Earth-based Autobots in &quot;&quot; #4.

In &quot;Rising Storm&quot; #1, it is revealed that Arcee, Chromia, and Elita-One survived the events in Egypt and with the Autobots when they set a trap for Starscream&#x27;s minions Divebomb, Fearswoop and Skystalker by having Theodore Galloway pose as an arms dealer attempting to purchase Cybertronian technology. The trap is uncovered and the Autobots send in Arcee, Chromia, Elita-One, Ironhide, Mudflap and Skids. Divebomb and Skystalker are killed while Fearswoop is captured by the Autobots and taken back to the NEST base on Diego Garcia. In issue #3, she, Chromia, and Elita one are sent to New York City hoping to get information from Starscream who was sending information to humans, but instead found Astrotrain and a monster, then they realized Shockwave is on Earth. They tried to contact Optimus and warn him, but Soundwave jammed their communications and were attack by his minions. Elita-One went to go warn Optimus. In issue #4, Elita-One is killed by Shockwave, Arcee and Chromia felt her death, they sent off the explosives which possibility killed Soundwave&#x27;s minions, but Arcee and Chromia survived.

Note - The appearance of Arcee is modified in some of the IDW Publishing stories, she has a Cybertronian alternate mode.

===Titan Magazines===
Note: Information in &quot;italics&quot; occurs in the alternate storyline where Megatron won the battle for the Allspark.

In &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; part 1, Skyblast lead the Autobots Arcee, Armorhide, Elita One, Longarm, and Strongarm who in resisting the Decepticons who had conquered Earth. In part 3 Starscream and Scorponok attack the Autobots Arcee, Armorhide, Elita One, Longarm, Skyblast, and Strongarm on the moon. The Autobots flee to Earth, which is exactly what Starscream hoped they&#x27;d do. In part 4 Ratchet and Ironhide continued fighting Bonecrusher in Savannah, but did not stand much of a chance until they were joined by Arcee, Armoride, and Longarm, arriving from the moon. In this story, Arcee resembles a pink version of her scout class toy in robot mode, but assumes a Cybertronian &quot;protoform entry mode&quot; for her vehicle mode. Arcee appeared in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called &quot;Return to Cybertron Part 1&quot;. In this story, she is among the Autobots that go to Cybertron. Arcee would return in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called &quot;The Decepticon who Haunted Himself.&quot;

===Target Robo-Vision===
According to her extended biography from the Target store exclusive Robo-Vision website, Arcee was only on Earth for a short time before her stealth skills were needed elsewhere. Optimus Prime sent her to another planet to stop Decepticon research on a star breaking weapon.

===Films===
In &quot;Revenge of the Fallen&quot;, Arcee was accompanied by two similar Transformers, Chromia and Elita One, sharing similar robot and vehicle forms, as well as the same holographic driver. They chased the Decepticon Sideways in an alley in Shanghai, but lost track of him. They were later present when the Autobots faced off with the Decepticons in Egypt, and were sent with Ironhide as an advance team to recover Sam. Upon finding Sam and Mikaela, several Decepticons attacked, and Arcee and Elita One were shot and killed while Chromia was last seen taking cover.

In &quot;Age of Extinction&quot;, a card with her picture on it was seen with a Red &#x27;X&#x27; through it, confirming her death.

In &quot;Bumblebee&quot;, Arcee makes a small talking cameo at the beginning of the film with her original G1 appearance. It is strongly implied that she survived the onslaught of Cybertron and made it to Earth at the end of the film.

In &quot;Rise of the Beasts&quot;, Arcee appears on Earth as a white and red Ducati 916 motorcycle, being called out by Optimus seeing a pulse of energy, saying that it is the way home.

She forms an alliance with the other miners by Orion Pax, who told them that the leader Sentinel Prime betrayed the Primes and has secretly been working for the Quintessons, giving them regular Energon supplies in exchange for letting him rule Cybertron while removing the miners&#x27; cogs to keep them subservient. In the end, after Sentinel&#x27;s death, and Orion Pax being called Optimus Prime, Arcee receives her cog, and joins Optimus&#x27; allies being named Autobots.

==Transformers: Animated==

Arcee is a female Autobot who seems to be inspired by her &quot;Generation 1&quot; counterpart and Susan Blu reprises the role. She was originally a teacher before the war began, her full name being Teaching Unit RC-687040.

===Animated series===
Arcee makes an appearance in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Thrill of the Hunt&quot;. During several flashback sequences, Ratchet recalls his first encounter with the rogue bounty hunter Lockdown during the Great War thousands of years earlier. Still a young field medic at that time, Ratchet comes across Arcee, who has been injured in the fighting. He knocks her out to repair her left leg, but then they are both ambushed by Lockdown. After being taken to his hideout, Lockdown divulges that Arcee is carrying vital information Megatron would be interested in, intent to extract it for his employer. After Lockdown forcibly removes Ratchet&#x27;s medical-use electro-magnetic pulse generator from his left arm as a personal trophy, Arcee manages to sneak it back to Ratchet. She then bravely tells Ratchet to use the EMP device on her to erase her data core so that Lockdown will not be able to retrieve the data from her. After protesting that doing so would also completely erase her entire life and memory, Ratchet is suddenly forced to do so in order to protect them both from Lockdown. After escaping, Arcee&#x27;s memory has, as expected, been completely erased, including all knowledge of herself.

It was revealed in &quot;Transwarped&quot; that due to a special fail-safe program after being placed in stasis, Arcee uploads the data into Ratchet, allowing him to continue her mission of activating Omega Supreme.

Long after the Great War has ended, a now-older Ratchet honors her by keeping the painful memory of her intact in his own mind. However, by the events of &quot;This is Why I Hate Machines&quot;, when Megatron arrives to Cybertron in Omega Supreme, the exposed Shockwave begins setting up a scheme to track down Arcee and acquire the access code to Omega Supreme from her. His plans are delayed when Ratchet and Captain Fanzone arrive on Cybertron and made an attempt protect to Arcee before Shockwave escapes with her. However, it turned out her memory may not be as lost as previously believed. Though at first only her pre-war memories were available, Shockwave manages to recover her war-time ones before forcefully extracting the activation codes when she refused to give them willingly. This action resulted with Arcee relapsing until Sari&#x27;s new-found ability allows Ratchet to use his EMP generator to restore Arcee&#x27;s memories before she uses her codes to regain control of Omega Supreme. In the aftermath of the final battle on Earth, Arcee returns home to Cyberton with the Autobots, Omega Supreme, and the captured Megatron.

==Aligned Continuity==

Arcee is one of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 animated series &quot;&quot;. She transforms into a blue motorcycle, inspired by her appearance in the live film series, but with a more humanoid robot form. As a motorcycle she is capable of producing a humanoid female hologram driver who she refers to as &quot;Sadie&quot; to help disguise her identity. She can form bladed weapons or blasters from her hands. Arcee is the most focused character in the series, and arguably the show&#x27;s main protagonist for much of the first and second seasons. Arcee played a smaller role in the third season, but had an episode that focused on her, &quot;Plus One&quot;, where she started a potential relationship with Wheeljack, convincing him to stay with the Autobots. She is the only character to have actual flashbacks and complete in-depth origin episodes, whereas characters such as Optimus Prime and Smokescreen have images of an event while they narrate the story. Arcee is also the only character to have two &quot;arch-enemies&quot; Starscream and Airachnid, creating a three-way rivalry, holding a grudge against the two for killing her former partners Cliffjumper and Tailgate respectively. She is also the only character who appeared in every single episode of the series until &quot;Triangulation&quot; (in which she was only mentioned) in the middle of the second season. After that she was absent from only three more episodes: &quot;Triage&quot;, &quot;Chain of Command&quot;, and &quot;Thirst&quot; (a Decepticon focused episode that featured no Autobots). Coincidentally, Arcee&#x27;s human partner Jack, is arguably the most focused human of the series, having had his own background focused on more in-depth unlike most other human characters.

===Books===
Arcee appears in the short story &quot;Bumblebee at Tyger Pax&quot; By Alex Irvine.

Arcee appears as an unlockable character in the 2010 video game &quot;&quot; and on a poster in its 2012 sequel &quot;&quot;. Arcee appears as a playable character in the 2012 video game &quot;&quot;. Arcee, as the Angry Birds Stella transformed, is an unlockable character in Angry Birds Transformers. Arcee as the Overwatch character Illari in an unlockable cosmetic.

===IDW Publishing===
Before the war, Arcee had been spying in Kaon, and sometime during it she had been rescued by Cliffjumper. When Optimus ordered the Autobots to Earth, her ship had been destroyed, and she was willing to wait as she detected the Decepticons had returned to Cybertron and they were planning something &quot;big&quot;. There, she entered a base and annihilated the Vehicons there, inadvertently returning Cliffjumper&#x27;s favor. She hacked into the Decepticons&#x27;s communications signal there, and found their weapons lab in Kaon. Arcee found Cliffjumper a brash soldier inappropriate for her stealthy mission, but he convinced her Kaon was too dangerous and that she could use his ship to go to Earth.

The duo entered the city through the maintenance tunnels Arcee had once explored, and she found a secret staircase by activating an Autobot symbol on the wall. There they discovered Starscream had rebuilt a space bridge to travel to Earth. Concerned by the repercussions of the Decepticons&#x27;s discovery of how to build space bridges, Arcee wanted to destroy it, but Cliffjumper convinced her it was their way off Cybertron. Distracting Starscream with a ruse, Arcee activated the space bridge and overloaded its systems, jumping through it with him before it blew up.

Landing on Earth, the duo scanned their alternate modes and traveled to find a population center where they could build a scanner and find Optimus. Starscream attacked, having also jumped through the space bridge, blasting Arcee&#x27;s arm off. Cliffjumper fought him and tried to get Arcee to safety, but she refused, telling him to leave her and find Optimus. Optimus and Bumblebee appeared, fending off Starscream and Breakdown. Optimus carried Arcee through a GroundBridge to base, where Ratchet reattached her arm.

Following Optimus&#x27;s sacrifice, Arcee, Bumblebee and Bulkhead encountered Sludge in a tunnel. They emerged on the surface in time to help Grimlock and the other Dinobots fight a squad of Forged. Arcee was shocked to hear they&#x27;d been created by Shockwave. After dealing with that threat, Arcee starting filling the Dinobots in on recent events, only for them to be promptly attacked by a new Predacon. The Autobots split into groups to head to Kaon, with Arcee and Swoop taking one group of survivors. Swoop drew off the Predacon when it attacked, allowing Arcee and the other to reach Kaon while the Predacon was dealt with. There, Arcee explained that the Dinobots would always be welcome in the Autobot ranks. Grimlock, however, said the Dinobots would be unable to help with the reconstruction of Kaon, since they&#x27;d be building a new home for the survivors.

===Titan Magazines===
Arcee took part in the testing of Ratchet&#x27;s newly developed Safe training room, though she was amused by the medic&#x27;s interest in making things explode. After Bulkhead broke through a wall, Arcee alerted the others to the rather large nuclear missile he&#x27;d accidentally uncovered and activated. A Vehicon scouting party showed up looking for the source of the energy signature the bomb was giving off, so Optimus, Arcee and Bumblebee went out to trash them. The trio returned to base a short time later to find Fowler had arrived to deal with the bomb. Optimus took the other Autobots, including Arcee, on a trip to Valley of Fire State Park.

Arcee roundly mocked Bulkhead as he attempted to decorate a Christmas tree. Unfortunately for her, after Fowler reported that the Decepticons had taken over a nuclear-powered ship, she found herself left at base with Bulkhead. The kids suggested she and Bulkhead try to find something they both liked, but progress was slow until they discovered their mutual love of ice skating. They subsequently turned the base into an ice rink and skated around it until the other Autobots came back.

She and Jack scouted out Franklin High School when schools in the region began unexpectedly exploding. It paid off when MECH turned up, however while Arcee was on the comm to Optimus, Jack sneaked inside the school. Arcee crashed inside to rescue him from MECH, though he insisted on following the baddies up to the roof. Silas got away anyway, and Arcee had to get Jack off the burning building. After the President of the United States was kidnapped, the Autobots traced the culprit, Starscream, to the Grand Canyon. Bumblebee and Arcee teamed up to take out the cannons manned by Vehicons that Starscream had brought along.

Arcee and Bulkhead headed to Zhejiang Province, China after the Autobots lost contact with Optimus Prime. They found Knock Out and a bunch of Vehicons feeding Optimus&#x27;s body into a crusher but were overcome by the Decepticons before they could rescue him. Luckily Optimus came to his senses in time. After Miko was kidnapped by MECH agent Novo, Arcee joined the hunt to find her.

Arcee was bemused by Jack&#x27;s demonstration of bobbing for apples. She was on the team which visited the Deep Driller oil platform and encountered General Madison and his men. After ending up underneath Bulkhead, she managed to trick two of the soldiers in robotic battle suits into shooting each other. When Bulkhead went missing, Arcee searched in vain until Miko managed to work out he was on the Decepticon ship. Arcee was subsequently part of the mission to rescue their friend. Arcee took part in a battle against the Decepticons in The Wave.

Following a TV studio takeover by Knock Out and Breakdown, Arcee came along on the mission as backup. She took to the shadows, and once Optimus had rescued the other hostages, Arcee rescued Chuck Chuckles and took down the two Decepticons herself.

====Mega-Mouth====
Arcee occasionally takes time out from defending the universe and protecting the planet Earth in disguise to answer fan mail. In every issue, Arcee gets her own segment (sometimes with Megatron) to comment on the readers&#x27; fan mail and/or fan-art they sent them.

===&quot;Tales of the Beast Hunters&quot;===
Arcee tracked Ripclaw to the Canadian Rockies. Rather than attack directly, she leaked the coordinates to the Decepticons in the hope they would deal with the problem.

===Animated series===
Arcee was a regularly appearing character in the &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot; animated series. Arcee was a participant in the Great War and originally was partnered with Tailgate. During one mission, she talked to Tailgate on comm before being captured by Airachnid for interrogation. Arcee was tied up and refused to talk. To try to make her talk, Airachnid captured Tailgate and threatened to kill him. When she still didn&#x27;t talk, Airachnid slaughtered him before her very eyes. After Tailgate was killed, Arcee was saved by Bumblebee and Cliffjumper. She began working alone and distancing herself from others to cope with her grief.

Arcee was captured by Starscream and taken captive alongside fellow Autobot Cliffjumper. She claimed to have never met him before and when Starscream said he would kill Cliffjumper if she did not cooperate, Arcee showed little to no concern about him. Starscream took the two Autobots to Shockwave, who was on Cybertron. Shockwave used a cortical psychic patch to get the Intel, but the two managed to escape before he could kill them. They raced into a Space Bridge and teamed up with Optimus Prime. Cliffjumper and Arcee became partners at this time.

===&quot;Robots in Disguise&quot;===
Although she doesn&#x27;t appeared in the series, a picture of her shown and was along with the list of Autobots who were backlisted by the Decepticons disguised as the new High Council for being a supporter of Optimus Prime following the restoration of Cybertron after the Great War. In her picture, she resembles her G1 Counterpart but is still colored blue.

===Relationships===
*Cliffjumper - Arcee, at first, seemed indifferent and even a little hostile towards Cliffjumper at first, as she told Starscream to &quot;go ahead and slag himself&quot; when he threatened to kill Cliffjumper in order to get information from her during flashbacks in Out of the Past. Later on in the episode, she saved his life, but then made it clear that she didn&#x27;t want him around. Cliffjumper, however, acted very differently as he told Shockwave to leave Arcee alone and use the Cortical Phycic Patch on him instead (something Shockwave did not do) and got distressed to the point of threatening to kill Starscream and Shockwave after Arcee apparently died at their hand (as it turned out, she was playing possum to get the &#x27;Cons offguard) It was Cliffjumper who managed to reach Arcee through the shell she had created for herself due to the trauma she faced after witnessing Tailgate&#x27;s murder. By the end of the episode, the two of them had begun to get along, with Arcee finally accepting Cliffjumper as a friend. Cliffjumper&#x27;s death at the hands of Starscream seemed to reopen old wounds as she had to face the pain of losing another partner. She was distraught when she found out that the Decepticons had turned his body into a Terrorcon zombie, to the point that she collapsed upon returning to their base. Arcee continues to grieve for him throughout the first season, as she is shown talking to his grave site and then promising to avenge his death.
*Optimus Prime - Arcee is one of Optimus&#x27; right hand soldiers. Even though Optimus is taller than Arcee, she&#x27;s his best fighter, his &quot;go to gal&quot; whenever he needs someone to talk with. Arcee sees Optimus Prime as a great leader and friend, even stating to Ratchet once that she would give her life for him. She informally serves as his second in command, although it is worth noting that she has been known to occasionally disregard his orders - due to her overwhelming desire to seek vengeance upon her enemies, like Airachnid. Despite this, Arcee appears much closer to Optimus than the other Autobots. The two were together when they discovered Cliffjumper had been killed. Later Arcee accompanied Optimus to find Cliffjumper&#x27;s body after its life signal appeared online, where Optimus gave her cover fire as he shot through several Decepticons. She and Optimus went alongside each other to the Arctic. After failing to retrieve what they wanted, the two were stranded there together as Ratchet, Bulkhead and Bumblebee tried to fix the base after it was attacked by Scraplets. She related to Optimus her surprise to die in an Arctic, rather than by the hands of the Decepticons. Arcee is seen to hang out with Optimus and talk with him. Arcee never argues with Optimus or show any rage towards him. Arcee would comfort Optimus or even help him get to his feet. She respects Optimus and sees him as a true leader and friend to have. Optimus protects and sees Arcee as a strong soldier and friend. Arcee seems to know a lot about being a Prime. She indicates Optimus not being the party type of bot and that he never runs from a fight. As a leader, Optimus always ensure the safety of his team, which includes Arcee&#x27;s safety. He also acts as a father figure to her as she appears much younger than him.
* Bumblebee - Arcee may be looked up to by Bumblebee, possibly due to her skills and overall personality. She has previously addressed Bumblebee as &#x27;family&#x27; rather than &#x27;friend,&#x27; and appears to regard him as something of a younger brother. Bumblebee and Arcee are shown to fight together in battle. Arcee never argued with Bumblebee and seemed to comfort him whenever he felt impaired. Bumblebee would save or protect Arcee from any danger. The two were together during Jack&#x27;s initial meeting with the Autobots and fought Vehicons together before Bulkhead arrived. She, Bumblebee and the other Autobots fought against Knock Out and Breakdown during their attempt to steal the Energon Harvester, which proved successful as the Autobots were defeated. She and Bumblebee went to retrieve two relics together, only coming back successful for the first and failing to secure the second. She met back up with Bumblebee and Ratchet when Ultra Magnus found the two. She complimented Bumblebee on his new paint job, citing that if she had also reversed her colors, she would be pink. She later teamed up with on the assault at Darkmount and was made his commander in the &quot;Stealth Team&quot;. She was shocked when Bumblebee died and even more surprised when he was revived, and later told him that his voice had returned. In &quot;Predacons Rising&quot;, Arcee told Bumblebee that he has proved his mettle in battle and on the team. He replied by saying it did not hurt to watch and learn from the best as he referred to her as a powerful little two wheeler.
*Smokescreen - Arcee suspected Smokescreen as a Decepticon spy when he first arrived, but she later worried for him as he was not being careful about contact with humans. After many attempts on his part to be a hero she scolded him like a mother. When Smokescreen was seemingly killed by the Dark Star Saber, Arcee mourned losing another partner. She was surprised and relieved when he used Phase Shifter and it had saved his life. When Smokescreen seemed to care more about his ego than restoring Cybertron she lashed out at him, despite Optimus telling her that she made her point. This caused Smokescreen to drive away in a huff, which led to him being captured by Soundwave. After Smokescreen returned uninjured from the Nemesis with two Omega Keys, she finally gave him the respect he had rightfully earned. She came to have more respect for him after it was implied he played a vital role in saving Optimus Prime&#x27;s and all the other Autobots&#x27; lives.
* Wheeljack - Wheeljack and Arcee are two opposites of the same warrior. When Wheeljack almost abandoned the team, Arcee stepped in to help Wheeljack. They both went to get a Predacons bone and talk about Wheeljack&#x27;s problem. Wheeljack had a little problem with his new commander, Ultra Magnus. But that wasn&#x27;t the main problem, it was Bulkhead becoming &quot;soft&quot;. Wheeljack and Bulkhead used to be serious in the Wreckers and they would do whatever it takes to complete their mission. Arcee told Wheeljack to not push Bulkhead away because she knows how it feels to lose a partner. Wheeljack was feeling a little better, thanks to Arcee&#x27;s pep talk. After that, Wheeljack started to become a team player and has respect for Ultra Magnus and Bulkhead. Wheeljack and Arcee are like two lone wolves. They prefer to work alone, even though they would do whatever it takes to be a true team player on their team.
*Megatron - When Arcee and Bumblebee snuck aboard the Nemesis to retrieve a cure for Optimus, Arcee saw Megatron&#x27;s unconscious body. After Bumblebee succeeded in getting the formula from Megatron, Arcee shot the latter&#x27;s life support cord out of his body. During the Autobots attempt to get Optimus Prime back, Megatron attacked and defeated Bumblebee, Ratchet, Bulkhead and Orion Pax before Arcee came through the Space Bridge and knocked him in the back. She briefly fought the Decepticon, being able to dodge several of his blasts before being grabbed and put against a wall by the Decepticon leader. After Optimus was revived with the Key to Vector Sigma, Arcee and the other Autobots participated in shooting at the Decepticon before retreating through a GroundBridge. After Megatron abandoned the Decepticons in &quot;Predacons Rising&quot;, Arcee may have forgiven Megatron.
*Starscream - Initially, Arcee held no anger towards Starscream significantly, as he was of no more significance to her than any other Decepticon. She, Bulkhead and Bumblebee stopped him from torturing William Fowler after he had Soundwave capture the latter for interrogation for discovery of the location of the Autobot base. Soon enough, she stopped him from causing any harm to Bulkhead, whom was preoccupied stopping a tunnel from falling, instead having Starscream do so. Shortly afterwards, she was shocked to see Starscream willing to join the Autobots. The group discussed his motives and ultimately agreed that they would give him a chance. Arcee was left alone with him, this proving fatal as she discovered he had murdered Cliffjumper. Angered, she chose to attack him. However, not before giving him the keys to his cuffs. As she came closer, Starscream cowered and begged for mercy. As she reached to grab the keys, he jabbed her in the side with his sharp fingers and attacked her. During the ensuring battle, she gained the upper hand on the Decepticon and came close to finishing him off before Bumblebee arrived on the scene. The two would next met after the Autobots went to the location Starscream had told Ratchet and Bulkhead of. Starscream saved Arcee&#x27;s life by shooting at Airachnid and thereby, driving his fellow rogue Decepticon off before she could finish Arcee off. Though Arcee expected Starscream to finish her off, Starscream remembered their last encounter and how she had allowed him to live. As such, he did the same for her, cutting her down from her hanging place and walking off after doing so.
*Airachnid - Arcee was trapped by Airachnid during the Great War on Cybertron, alongside her partner Tailgate. However, she was the only one of the two to survive as Airachnid killed Tailgate after Arcee claimed to have not known anything. Soon enough, Arcee was saved by Bumblebee and Cliffjumper, dragged off with the guilt of not being able to save her partner from his death. The two would meet again on Earth, Arcee instantly recognizing her ship while scouting with her new ally, human Jack Darby. Despite Arcee&#x27;s initial inability to defeat the Decepticon, she summed up the strength and saved Jack from Airachnid. The two crossed paths again when Airachnid allied with MECH and kidnapped June Darby. Arcee&#x27;s next confrontation with Airachnid would be during a mission with the other Autobots when Airachnid left Starscream alone. Upon seeing her, she chased after Airachnid and fought her before being placed in a headlock. She was saved by Optimus and forced to remain behind when Optimus realized that Arcee&#x27;s longing to avenge Tailgate would only continue to cloud her judgment. Arcee and Airachnid met up again when Airachnid had her new Insecticon attack Megatron. Arcee ran off on her own again and managed to nearly get killed before being saved by Starscream, whom also held a vendetta against the Decepticon. Their next and final encounter would be when Airachnid launched her Insecticon army to destroy Megatron. After aiming at Airachnid, she had the lower fleet of her Insecticons attack Arcee and the other Autobots. After coming down to face her, Arcee attacked and pursued her until Airachnid accidentally landed in an Insecticon pod, cryogenically freezing her and causing the entirety of the Insecticons to join Megatron. Optimus was proud of Arcee and told her that she was stronger for the choice she made of not killing Airachnid.

== Transformers: EarthSpark ==

Arcee participated in the final battle of the Transformers War, helping clear the way for Bumblebee to rush the AllSpark to the spacebridge.

Fifteen years later, Arcee heard Bumblebee had come out of hiding and went to the Malto family farm in Witwicky to check up on him. Seeing an opportunity, Bumblebee decided she would be the Malto kids&#x27; substitute teacher for the day, allowing him to slip away and assist Optimus Prime and Megatron on a mission. Though confused by the sudden turn of events, Arcee took it in stride and told the young humans and Terrans that their first lesson would be on digging trenches. After the students had followed instructions, she congratulated them on their progress...then ordered the trenches filled back in. This escalated as Arcee continued to assign them increasingly grueling and mundane chores until Twitch finally snapped and refused to continue, with her siblings backing her. Surprisingly, Arcee applauded them, saying this was the actual lesson: speaking up when something doesn&#x27;t seem right. She then took the kids with her to assist on Bumblebee&#x27;s mission, and she helped the other bots take down Soundwave. In the aftermath, Arcee eagerly discussed all the other lessons she planned to teach the kids, but Bumblebee reasserted his position as their teacher—just as Arcee hoped he would.

Arcee joined Optimus and other Autobots in answering Hashtag&#x27;s distress call, arriving at the Malto farm to battle the Ghoid soldiers. Though they were victorious, Croft activated a Mandroid-supplied device that shut down Arcee and the other Autobots present. They were still unconscious when Mandroid arrived back from space in a new semi-robotic form. Mandroid remotely reactivated Arcee and the others, placing them under his control and sending them to intercept the Maltobots who were heading to thwart his plans. Grimlock, Arcee and Wheeljack attempted to trap the group on a bridge, resulting in Bumblebee and Schloder battling them to allow the others to go ahead. Ultimately Mandroid was able to activate the superweapon he&#x27;d created, deactivating Arcee until Robby and Mo successfully used their cyber-sleeves to revive the Autobots.

A year after Mandroid&#x27;s defeat, Arcee was one of the Autobots who stormed the Decepticon base to recover the remaining Ember-shards. She was frozen in place with the other Autobots by the power of the corrupted Emberstone. She was returned to normal when the Emberstone was destroyed.

In Season 3, Arcee greeted Prowl with an arm wrestle when he arrived on Earth. Arcee was one of the Autobots infected with the Hate Plauge because of Bumblebee, and it resulted in both Arcee and Elita-1 fighting with each other as well as with the other Autobots until Hashtag successfully cured the Autobots by hacking the base&#x27;s systems to drop the temperature to freezing. Arcee turned out for the arrival of the Quintessons on Earth and had to help the Autobots evacuate Witwicky when the Quintessons destroyed the Chaos Dome, unleashing a storm of chaos energy. She was present for the revival of the Chaos Terrans and the escape of Robby, Mo, Twitch and Thrash from the Quintesson ship, subsequently taking part in a diversionary battle while Mo restored Terratronus to life so that the Titan could successfully destroy the Quintessons.

<text>Firing Line is an American public affairs television show. It first ran from 1966 to 1999, with conservative author and columnist William F. Buckley Jr. as host. It was relaunched in 2018 with Margaret Hoover as host.

With 1,504 episodes over 33 years under Buckley, &quot;Firing Line&quot; was the longest-running public affairs show with a single host in television history. The program featured many influential public figures in the United States and won an Emmy Award in 1969.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Firing Line&quot; began on April 4, 1966, as an hour-long show (including breaks) for commercial television. The program was produced at WOR-TV in New York City and was syndicated nationally through that station&#x27;s parent company RKO General and later Show Corporation of America, a syndication firm which RKO acquired majority ownership of in 1968. &quot;Firing Line&quot; was mainly seen on weekends in low-rated afternoon or late-night time slots, because of the program&#x27;s admitted appeal to a small, &quot;middle-brow&quot; demographic group. The first 39 episodes of the series were taped in black-and-white; the series was converted to color in January 1967.

In the fall of 1966, &quot;Firing Line&quot; began to appear on noncommercial educational television stations, mostly in areas where RKO General found it difficult to sell the program to a commercial outlet. After 240 episodes aired in commercial syndication &quot;Firing Line&quot; moved exclusively to noncommercial television in May 1971, distributed by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and produced under the auspices of the Southern Educational Communications Association, an arm of South Carolina Educational Television. This was somewhat unusual, given the reputation among many conservatives that PBS unfairly discriminated against non-liberal viewpoints in its other programming. SECA/SCETV, however, was one of the very few public broadcasting entities of the time that was sympathetic to the conservative movement.

Because the program received a relatively unfavorable Sunday evening timeslot on PBS&#x27; schedule in the early 1970s, Buckley and long-time director Warren Steibel briefly attempted to return &quot;Firing Line&quot; to commercial TV, but could not find sponsors. Thus, the program would remain on PBS until Buckley and Steibel discontinued production on December 17, 1999, with Buckley&#x27;s final episode airing December 26, 1999.

In April 2018, PBS announced that it would begin airing a new &quot;Firing Line,&quot; hosted by Margaret Hoover.

==Buckley tenure==

===Show format===
Although the program&#x27;s format varied over the years, it typically featured Buckley interviewing, and exchanging views with, a guest, while seated together in front of a small studio audience. Standing or sitting further away in the studio, an &quot;examiner&quot;, typically a liberal, would ask questions, generally toward the end of the show. Most guests were intellectuals or those in positions of power, being notable in the fields of politics, religion, literature and academia. Their views could either sharply contrast or be in strong agreement with Buckley&#x27;s.

Reflecting Buckley&#x27;s talents and preferences, the exchange of views was almost always polite, and the guests were given time to answer questions at length, giving the program a leisurely pace. &quot;The show was devoted to a leisurely examination of issues and ideas at an extremely high level&quot;, according to Jeff Greenfield, who frequently appeared as an examiner. John Kenneth Galbraith said of the program, &quot;&quot;Firing Line&quot; is one of the rare occasions when you have a chance to correct the errors of the man who&#x27;s interrogating you.&quot;

The show might be compared in politeness and style of discourse to other national public interview shows, specifically those hosted by Richard Heffner, Charlie Rose or Terry Gross, but Buckley was clearly interested in debate. In a 1999 &quot;Salon.com&quot; article, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; editor William Kristol summarized Buckley&#x27;s approach to the show: &quot;Buckley really believes that in order to convince, you have to debate and not just preach, which of course means risking the possibility that someone will beat you in debate.&quot; Buckley was not averse to asking tough questions of friendly guests either, according to Tom Wolfe, who recalled the interviewer asking him whether there were really any original insights in his book &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;.

Buckley and his producer, Warren Steibel, used various methods over the years to bring extra perspectives to the show. In the early years, there would often be a panel of questioners. In 1977 the panel was replaced by an &quot;examiner&quot; who played a larger part in the proceedings. Examiners varied, with Jeff Greenfield, Michael Kinsley, Harriet Pilpel, and Mark Green appearing most frequently. When the show was shortened to 30 minutes in 1988, the role of examiner was eliminated, but there was often a moderator, whose role was similar to that of the moderator in a formal debate. The moderator would introduce both host and guest, and then ask the opening question.

Starting in 1978, scattered among the regular broadcasts were occasional specials and two-hour formal debates, with opening statements, cross-examination, and closing statements. In 1988, at Buckley&#x27;s request, the running time of regular program shows was reduced from one hour to a half-hour. Beginning in March 1993, the two-hour formal debates would often be followed by half-hour shows in which most or all of the participants engaged in informal discussion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the debate episodes were frequently broadcast on the Monday evenings after PBS pledge drives concluded.

A recurring episode that Buckley had rebroadcast every Christmas, beginning in 1981, was an interview he did with Malcolm Muggeridge at his home in Sussex, England. The title of the episode was &quot;How Does One Find Faith?&quot; The episode deals with questions that are religious and spiritual in nature.

===Buckley&#x27;s persona===
Buckley&#x27;s distinctive mannerisms were prominently displayed by the program and were part of the public images of both the show and Buckley. Buckley was frequently seen leaning far back in his chair, a pen near his mouth and a clipboard in hand. His flicking tongue, widening eyes, and flashing smile also characterized his style, as did his multi-syllabic vocabulary. Buckley&#x27;s voice was widely satirized, for instance by Robin Williams on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and in the animated movie &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

At the same time that guests were treated politely, Buckley might also gently mock them, particularly if he was friendly with them, as with John Kenneth Galbraith or examiner Mark Green. &quot;You&#x27;ve been on the show close to 100 times over the years&quot;, Buckley once asked Green. &quot;Tell me, Mark, have you learned anything yet?&quot; When Allen Ginsberg asked if he could sing a song in praise of Krishna, Buckley acceded and the poet chanted &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; repeatedly as he played dolefully on a harmonium. According to Richard Brookhiser, an associate of Buckley&#x27;s, the host commented that it was &quot;the most unharried Krishna I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;.

Buckley&#x27;s celebrated politeness sometimes wore thin: In a 1969 debate with linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky, Buckley said, &quot;I rejoice in your disposition to argue the Vietnam question, especially when I recognize what an act of self-control this must involve.&quot; Chomsky acknowledged, &quot;Sometimes I lose my temper. Maybe not tonight.&quot; &quot;Maybe not tonight&quot;, Buckley said, &quot;because if you would I&#x27;d smash you in the goddamn face.&quot; (This comment was a joking throwback to Buckley&#x27;s famous response to Gore Vidal, when, during another Vietnam debate, Vidal called Buckley a &quot;crypto-Nazi&quot;.)

Buckley addressed his guests as &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Mrs.&quot; He once called Margaret Thatcher &quot;Margaret&quot; because he thought she had addressed him as &quot;Bill&quot;. He was embarrassed later when he saw the transcript and realized she had been referring to a legislative bill. He immediately wrote a personal letter of apology to the Prime Minister.

For the show&#x27;s 15th anniversary in 1981, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Vernon Jordan, Henry Kissinger, and Louis Auchincloss presided over a party for Buckley at the New York Yacht Club.

==Hoover tenure==
===Revival===
Margaret Hoover hosts the Firing Line reboot on PBS. The show premiered on June 2, 2018, on WNET, which serves the New York metropolitan area, and is the largest PBS market in the country. The show maintains the original format of deep exchange of ideas with a single guest on a single issue within its 26-minute runtime. It is produced weekly at the WNET Tisch Studios.

===Episodes===
The first fourteen episodes of the program featured guests representing a variety of sociopolitical ideologies, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Ohio Governor John Kasich, journalist Gretchen Carlson, Senator Jeff Merkley, &quot;the rising star of the political Left&quot;, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and &quot;accidental icon of the conservative movement&quot;, Jordan Peterson. Margaret Hoover&#x27;s interview with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez earned national and international attention for the latter&#x27;s comments ranging from the state of capitalism and the unemployment rate in the United States to the State of Israel, which earned Ocasio-Cortez derision at the time. The former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie was interviewed in which he referred to the crimes that Jared Kushner&#x27;s father committed as &quot;loathsome&quot;. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas declared in his interview that the U.S. could defeat Iran with, &quot;two strikes. The first strike and the last strike.&quot;

===Reception===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that, &quot;Under Ms. Hoover&#x27;s direction, the discourse is civil and substantive.&quot; A review of the show by the &quot;National Review&quot; states, &quot;the reincarnation of Firing Line comes at an interesting time, and a needful one.&quot; In the run-up to the show&#x27;s television premiere &quot;Politico&quot; said, &quot;It seems like a great idea, so let&#x27;s test drive it and see what happens.&quot; CNN anchor Poppy Harlow stated that &quot;Firing Line with Margaret Hoover&quot; &quot;is appointment television in my house&quot; on &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot;. Hoover has made multiple television appearances for the &quot;Firing Line&quot; reboot, including ones on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, and &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;.

In May 2019 Hoover was awarded Journalist of the Year by the &quot;Algemeiner Journal&quot; for her work as host.

<text>Aston-on-Trent is a village and civil parish in the South Derbyshire district, in the county of Derbyshire, England. The parish had a population of 1,682 at the 2011 Census. It is adjacent to Weston-on-Trent and near Chellaston, very close to the border with Leicestershire.

On the north bank of the River Trent, about a mile from the river on rising ground, it is out of its flood plain. The Trent and Mersey Canal runs between the village and the river.

All Saints’ Church is Celtic. There are two public houses, the White Hart and The Malt.

==History==
In 1009 Æþelræd Unræd (King Ethelred the Unready) signed a charter at the Great Council which recognised the position and boundaries of Westune. The land described in that charter included the lands now known as Shardlow, Great Wilne, Church Wilne, Crich, Smalley, Morley, Weston and Aston on Trent. Under this charter Æþelræd gave his minister, Morcar, a number of rights that made him free from tax and enabled his own rule within the manor.

This manor came under the control of the King again following Morcar being murdered in 1015 and the lands were later given to Ælfgar, the Earl of Mercia, but he lost this at the Norman Conquest. Aston is in the Domesday book where it is mentioned as an outlying farm of Weston-on-Trent and listed amongst the lands given to Henry de Ferrers by the King. The land given to Henry included of land that was valued at eight shillings.

The name is of Anglo-Saxon descent (&#x27;ton&#x27; an Old English suffix meaning farm). Being in the east, the name literally means &#x27;East Farm&#x27;. The &#x27;On-Trent&#x27; suffix of both Aston and nearby villages simply means they are near the river Trent.

Shardlow and Great Wilne were included in the parish of Aston-on-Trent until 1838, when Shardlow constructed its own church.

==Notable residents==
* James Sutton (1799-1868), boatbuilder, canal boat carrier and owner of a salt works
* William Drury-Lowe (1802–1877), a landowner who inherited the Locko Park lands
* Edward Anthony Holden (1805–1877), a landowner who lived at Aston Hall
* William Darwin Fox (1805–1880), a clergyman and naturalist, born nearby. 
* General Sir Drury-Lowe (1830–1908), a British Army officer
=== Sport ===
* Fred Forman (1873–1910), footballer, played 158 games for Nottingham Forest and 3 for England
* Frank Forman (1875–1961), footballer, played 223 games for Nottingham Forest and 9 for England
* Harry Linacre (1880–1957), football goalkeeper, played 308 games for Nottingham Forest and 2 for England

==Education==
The village has its own primary school – Aston-on-Trent Primary School – and is in the catchment area of Chellaston School.

==Recreation==
Football in Aston is over 100 years old and in that time the village has developed at least three players who went on to play for England. Aston-on-Trent was the birthplace of three men who all played football for England within a six-year spell. They were Harry Linacre (1881–1957), who was a goalkeeper for England and Nottingham Forest, and his uncles Fred and Frank Forman. Harry was picked for England twice in 1905 helping them to victory both times. All three men were also originally signed by Derby County and then sold on to Nottingham Forest.

Today Aston-on-Trent F.C. consists of both a Saturday side playing in the Midlands Regional Alliance, and a Sunday side playing in the Derby Taverners League. 2013/14 saw the Sunday side win the cup double, building on many years&#x27; work to climb through the various divisions of the Long Eaton leagues, where they also won the Premier League and cup double.

<doc id="819392" wikidata="Q901173" url="?curid=819392" title="Charlie Rose (talk show)">
<text>Charlie Rose (also known as The Charlie Rose Show) is an American television interview and talk show, with Charlie Rose as executive producer, executive editor, and host. The show was syndicated on PBS from 1991 until 2017 and is owned by Charlie Rose, Inc. Rose interviewed thinkers, writers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, businesspersons, leaders, scientists, and fellow newsmakers.

==History==

The show premiered on September 30, 1991. It was formerly presented by WNET, where it first aired as a local program. The program was additionally broadcast by Bloomberg Television with a week delay, which formerly provided the show&#x27;s recording facility. The set was simple, set up with an all-dark surrounding space around an oak round table used since the program debuted and purchased by Rose himself, along with accompanying chairs.

Funding for the show was primarily provided by donations from various corporations and charitable foundations. The program was criticized for not disclosing their list of donors within their underwriting disclosure.

In 2010, Rose and co-host Eric Kandel began &quot;The Brain Series&quot;, episodes featuring neuroscientists and other experts; the series was later released on DVD.

On May 7, 2012, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; began airing begin broadcasting in high definition, with broadcasts in a letterboxed format for viewers with standard-definition television sets watching via either cable or satellite television. The program also introduced a new set and converted its graphics package to HD.

In October 2014, a segment called &quot;Al Hunt on the Story&quot; was launched as a &quot;regular feature interview&quot;; Hunt&#x27;s first interview under this banner was with Secretary of State John Kerry.

The show was formerly taped at 731 Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, where Bloomberg Television and Bloomberg L.P. are based.

In February 2017, the show utilized a number of guest hosts (guest hosts also filled in for Rose on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;) while Rose underwent heart surgery. Afterwards, Rose stated a planned return in March.

On November 20, 2017, WNET, Bloomberg Television and PBS announced the suspension of distribution of the show after former employees of Charlie Rose, Inc. alleged Rose sexually harassed them. Bloomberg Television also pulled reruns of the series within only an hour&#x27;s notice. The next day, both PBS and Bloomberg cancelled distribution of the program and terminated their relationship with Rose; this de facto cancelled the show. CNNMoney reported on November 29 that Rose called the show&#x27;s staffers and let them know they would be paid until the end of the year and released from their contracts at the start of 2018; their access to the Bloomberg headquarters where the show recorded to remove personal effects would be terminated on December 8.

On December 4, it was announced that &quot;Amanpour&quot;, a CNN International interview program hosted by Christiane Amanpour, would re-air on PBS as an interim replacement for &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;. Rose&#x27;s show was ultimately replaced by Amanpour hosting &quot;Amanpour &amp; Company&quot;.

==Show musical theme==
The &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; music theme used up until its cancelation was composed exclusively for the series by David Lowe and David Shapiro, the father of Ben Shapiro.

==&quot;Charlie Rose: The Week&quot;==
&quot;Charlie Rose: The Week&quot; premiered on PBS on July 19, 2013. The show was a half-hour long, consisting of interviews from recent episodes of &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, with occasional unique segments produced for the weekly broadcast. &quot;The Week&quot; replaced the cancelled series &quot;Need to Know&quot;, and occupied that show&#x27;s former Friday time slot. It was cancelled by WNET and PBS on November 20, 2017, due to the sexual harassment allegations. Both also removed the show&#x27;s content and archives from their websites.

<doc id="819396" wikidata="Q646036" url="?curid=819396" title="Orishas (band)">
<text>Orishas are a Cuban hip hop group from Havana, Cuba, founded in 1999. The group was first called &quot;Amenaza&quot;, &quot;threat&quot; or &quot;menace&quot; in Spanish, and appealed to the Cuban youth. The choice of this name for the hip hop group is a way of creating a direct link between this band and the African diaspora. The group is based in France where they made a deal with a record company, although they visit Cuba frequently. In 1999 Fidel Castro threw a party for them and had a meeting with all the musicians. It was the first time the Cuban government showed support for hip hop music. The group was and still is popular in Europe (especially France, Italy, Spain and Portugal) and Latin America. Yotuel Romero and Ruzzo Medina, who moved from Havana to Paris as part of an international studies program, joined Roldán González and Flaco-Pro to form the band in 1999. Their work is influenced by the hip hop movement as well as Cuban and other Latin rhythms. , they had produced a total of five studio albums and a greatest hits album; their latest album is Gourmet (released May 25, 2018). In 2009 they participated in the concert Paz Sin Fronteras II in Plaza de la Revolución, Havana, Cuba. Orishas reunited to record new material in 2016.

The name &quot;Orishas&quot; refers to the set of deities worshipped in African-based religions in the Americas, like Santería in Cuba and Candomblé in Brazil, resulting from the relocation of enslaved Yoruba. These orishas each represent a natural element (such as the ocean or leaves) and exhibit a human characteristic (such as motherhood or love). This link is evident in the group&#x27;s lyrics, for example those of &quot;Nací Orichas&quot; and &quot;Canto Para Elewa Y Changó&quot;. The group&#x27;s success is a testament to both the international appeal of the group itself as well as the global popularity of Cuban culture. , the band consists of three members: Yotuel, Ruzzo and Roldán. Flaco-Pro left the group in 2002 before the release of its second studio album, Emigrante. The band members live in distributed locations in Europe (Roldán in Paris, Ruzzo in Milan, and Yotuel in Madrid). In 2007, they collaborated with Puerto Rican group Calle 13 on the song &quot;Pa&#x27;l Norte&quot; (from the album &quot;Residente o Visitante&quot;). The song won a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Song.

==Career==

===History===

Los Orishas began as Cuban rap group Amenaza in the early 1990s. Led by Joel Pando, Amenaza became the first rap group to address the issue of racial identity in Cuban society. In 1998, the members of Amenaza traveled to Paris to perform and accepted a record deal with a European label. The transition to Europe was critical in their musical career, as many rap groups in Cuba lacked the resources for professional recordings. In fact, of the hundreds of rappers in Cuba, Orishas is the only group that has achieved international acclaim . Their first album, &quot;A Lo Cubano&quot;, was released in Spain in May 1999 under the Orishas moniker. In the summer of 1999, Orishas began a two-year tour across Europe and the United States, which brought them international notice. In December 2000, Orishas returned to Cuba to perform two concerts, attracting tens-of-thousands of young Cubans.

As one of Cuba&#x27;s pioneer rap groups, Orishas garnered fame both at home and abroad. In 2006 they guested on the Track &quot;14Me&quot; recorded in Cuba by occasional The Black Eyed Peas producer Poet Name Life. The track was eventually released on the album &quot;The Revolution Presents: Revolution&quot;, (Studio !K7 &amp; Rapster Records) a Cuban dance crossover album which also featured Norman Cook a.k.a. Fatboy Slim, Róisín Murphy and Rich File from UK Trip Hop pioneers Unkle. , the members of the trio currently live in different European cities (Madrid, Milan, Paris), with the band based in France. Their incorporation of traditional Cuban beats like salsa and rumba into their rapping is an angle that brings appeal to older Cubans, while simultaneously driving some aspiring Cuban rappers to &quot;look at them with both awe and disappointment&quot; for &quot;selling out to commercial pressures to evoke Cuban nostalgia.&quot; Roldan himself has a tendency towards traditional Cuban music, and purposely distances his music from some of the stereotypical characteristics of hip-hop, such as the degrading treatment of women and &quot;everything [else] you do in U.S. hip hop shows&quot;.

<text>Carr is a common surname in northern England, a variant of Kerr, meaning &quot;brushwood wet ground&quot; in Middle English.

<text>The Citizens&#x27; Debate Commission (CDC) is a nonpartisan American organization, formed in 2004, that was established to sponsor future general election presidential debates.

The CDC consists of national civic leaders from a multitude of political orientations and has an advisory board composed of over fifty civic organizations that it claims broadly reflects the composition and concerns of the electorate.

The CDC states that it was formed because the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) fails to adequately serve voters&#x27; interests and charges that the CPD, which was created by the Republican and Democratic parties, secretly awards control of the presidential debates to the Republican and Democratic candidates, thereby limiting voter choice and restricting subject matters of political discourse.

The CDC claims to aim to host presidential debates that serve American voters, not political parties, first. The CDC promises to set fair candidate selection criteria, feature innovative and engaging formats, and resist anti-democratic demands of participating candidates. The CDC also promises to operate with full transparency and reverse the decline in debate viewership (Under the tenure of the CPD, debate viewership has dropped by over 25 million viewers.)

==Participant selection criteria==
The Citizens&#x27; Debate Commission (CDC) employs criteria developed by the Appleseed Citizens&#x27; Task Force on Fair Debates, a project of the Appleseed Electoral Reform Project at American University&#x27;s Washington College of Law.

The Appleseed Task Force criteria includes all candidates on enough state ballots to win an electoral college majority who either 1) register at five percent in national polls or 2) register a majority in national polls asking eligible voters which candidates they would like to see included in the presidential debates.

The Appleseed criteria attempts to ensure that popular third party challengers are allowed to participate without drowning out the voices of the two leading contenders for the presidency. In 1984 and 1988, only the major party candidates fulfilled the Appleseed criteria; in 1996 and 1992, only H. Ross Perot and the major party candidates managed to meet the Appleseed threshold; and in 2000, only Ralph Nader, Pat Buchanan and the major party candidates satisfied the criteria.

The CDC says the two prongs of the Appleseed criteria that trigger inclusion, five percent and majority support, are sensible because they are rooted in democratic principles and federal law. The five percent threshold matches the public financing threshold for minor parties, which is the only legislative standard for measuring the viability of non-major parties. Elected officials codified five percent in the Federal Election Campaign Act, and taxpayers finance candidates whose parties attract five percent of the popular vote.

==Format==
The Citizens&#x27; Debate Commission advocates the following format stipulations for future presidential debates:

#Follow-up questions must be permitted in every debate.
#At least one debate must include candidate-to-candidate questioning.
#At least two debates must include rebuttals and surrebuttals.
#Response times must not be overly restrictive.
#Candidates may only exercise a limited number of vetoes concerning the selection of moderators and panelists.

The Citizens&#x27; Debate Commission also proposes the following four basic formats for future presidential debates:

#Two single-moderator debates.
#Authentic town-hall debate.
#Youth debate.
#Panel debate.

<doc id="819439" wikidata="Q6312289" url="?curid=819439" title="June Gloom">
<text>June Gloom is a mainly Southern California term for a weather pattern that results in cloudy, overcast skies with cool temperatures during the late spring and early summer. While the marine layer is most common in the month of June, it can occur in surrounding months, giving rise to other colloquialisms, such as Graypril, May Gray, No-Sky July, and Summer Bummer. Low-altitude stratus clouds form over the cool water of the California Current, and spread overnight into the coastal regions of California. 

The overcast skies often are accompanied by fog and drizzle, though usually not rain. June Gloom usually clears up between mid-morning and early afternoon, depending on the strength of the marine layer and the distance of the location from the Pacific Ocean, and gives way to sunny skies. May and June together are usually the cloudiest months in coastal California. June Gloom is stronger in years associated with a La Niña, and weaker or nonexistent in years with an El Niño. This weather pattern is relatively rare, and occurs only in a few other parts of the world where climates and conditions are similar. Scientists study the cloud fields that make up June Gloom to increase understanding of cloud behavior at the onset of precipitation.

==Description==
A typical June Gloom morning consists of marine stratus clouds covering the coast of southern California, extending a varying distance inland depending on the strength of the June Gloom effect that day. On a strong June Gloom day, the clouds and fog may cover the San Francisco Bay Area, penetrate far inland down valleys such as the Salinas Valley in central California, or extend into the Inland Empire of southern California. It&#x27;s not uncommon for the layer to persist into the mid-afternoon or evening.

The clouds, which are formed by the marine layer, move in at night, usually after midnight, and typically dissipate in the late morning, giving way to clear, sunny skies. During a heavy June Gloom season, the condition may persist into the afternoon, or even all day during an exceptionally strong event. Often, the air is saturated with moisture, and fog also develops, along with frequent light mist and occasional drizzle. Fog and drizzle normally are found near the furthest inland extent of the gloom, where the cloud deck is closest to the ground. 

By late morning to early afternoon, solar heating usually is sufficient to evaporate the clouds, and the sun emerges. The phenomenon forms earliest and lasts longest at the coast, with weaker effects as it moves further inland. When the marine layer is strong and deep, clouds can fill the Los Angeles Basin and spill over into the San Fernando Valley and San Gabriel Valley, even extending into the Santa Clarita Valley and Inland Empire on exceptionally strong June Gloom mornings. If conditions are not as strong, the Basin may be filled while the valleys may be clear. It is not uncommon for motorists to drive over the Sepulveda Pass from the clear, sunny San Fernando Valley and plunge into a cloudy, fog-filled Los Angeles. On a weak June Gloom morning, the clouds and fog may only be present within a mile or two of the coastline, affecting only the beach cities.

==Climate effects==
A combination of atmospheric and oceanic conditions must be just right in order for June Gloom to form, and these conditions usually align only around May and June of each year. These include the marine layer effect common to the West Coast of the United States, an atmospheric inversion caused by subsidence of high-pressure air from the subtropical ridge, and sufficiently cool ocean water off the coast. The June Gloom pattern is also enhanced by the Catalina eddy local to southern California.

The months of May and June are typically the cloudiest months of the year in coastal southern California, having only 59% and 58% sunny days, respectively, on average in San Diego. The number of days in May and June that are &quot;gloomy&quot; varies from year to year. Anomalies in sea surface temperature can be used to forecast the length and intensity of the June Gloom phenomenon in a given season. Years with warmer ocean temperatures, referred to as El Niño, may result in fewer gray days in May and June. Cooler ocean temperatures, associated with La Niña, usually foretell a more gray period.

The climate charts below show a clear drop in the &quot;mean monthly sunshine hours&quot; and &quot;percent possible sunshine&quot; for the months of May and June, which are the two months when the June Gloom pattern is the strongest.


June Gloom has been reported by some Californians to bring on symptoms consistent with seasonal affective disorder, although this is not well-supported by evidence. However, the normally-very-sunny Los Angeles climate also is home to people who thrive during the brief seasonal respite the gloom provides from the unending sunshine and clear skies.

In the early 20th century, this phenomenon was sometimes known as the &quot;high fog.&quot; A long June Gloom season, extending late into the summer, is known as &quot;Summer Bummer.&quot; The negative effects of a long June Gloom on the coastal California tourism industry is often reported in the local news media. The phenomenon can be especially disorienting to visitors from inland areas who, coming from the summer heat, would not expect cool temperatures and clouds and fog at the beach.

==Formation==
The low-altitude stratus clouds that make up the June Gloom cloud layer form over the nearby ocean, and are transported over the coastal areas by the region&#x27;s prevailing westerly winds. The sheet-like stratus clouds are almost uniformly horizontal, covering large areas but having relatively shallow depth of . These clouds begin to form when wind mixes moisture from the ocean surface into the air. The air cools and expands as it is mixed and moves upward, and this cooling increases the relative humidity. When the relative humidity reaches 100%, the water vapor condenses into liquid water droplets and the clouds begin to form. The stable top of the marine layer, a result of the temperature inversion, prevents any dry, warm air from above the inversion from mixing with the stratus deck. This confines the stratus deck to a relatively narrow vertical band in the atmosphere, allowing it to strengthen.

The inversion layer is crucial to the formation of the marine stratus that produce June Gloom. Compression and warming of air sinking out of the North Pacific High-pressure system (which is strongest during the summer) meets with the rising, cooling air from the sea surface, producing a very stable layer of air that caps the cool air from rising any further. The strength of this subsidence inversion affects the strength of the marine layer, and how long it will take the clouds to dissipate. Additionally, the cool ocean water of the California Current, which flows out of the cold Gulf of Alaska, enhances the contrast between the cool air below the inversion layer and the warm air above it. A stronger inversion layer – one with a greater difference in temperature between the air above and the air below – often results in more and deeper marine layer clouds that persist longer into the day. Upwelling of colder-than-normal ocean water, associated with a La Niña, can strengthen this effect even more.

Once this marine layer has formed, the prevailing westerly winds advect the clouds over the coastal lands. The extent of inland advection is limited by southern California&#x27;s coastal mountain ranges. The winds will continue to push the cloud layer onshore until they encounter mountains at or above the altitude of the clouds themselves, with the mountains then preventing any further inland progress of the marine layer. The foothill regions of these mountains experience some of the thickest fog and drizzle, as they are essentially in the clouds at this point.

The marine layer clouds of a June Gloom day usually are at their maximum at dawn, when the surface air is at a minimum temperature and the temperature difference in the inversion layer is at its maximum. The air beneath the inversion base being at its coolest also makes it likely that it will be saturated with a relative humidity of 100%.
A sea breeze, which is caused by the temperature and pressure difference between warm areas inland and the cool air over the ocean, often develops on warm summer days as well, increasing the on-shore flow pattern and maintaining a constant flow of marine stratus clouds onto the coastal areas.

A strong low pressure system passing over southern California will produce the deepest and most extensive June Gloom marine layer. The marine layer effect is weakened when a weak high pressure system is in place over the region, and the marine layer will be very weak or nonexistent when there is a strong high-pressure system affecting southern California. The National Weather Service graphic on the right explains the effects of atmospheric conditions upon the marine layer and local weather conditions in more detail.

==Similar weather elsewhere in the world==
While many parts of the world commonly have an offshore marine layer of stratus or stratocumulus clouds, other locations matching the daily and seasonal effects of Southern California&#x27;s June Gloom are relatively rare. These include the western coast of Peru, the Macaronesian Islands, the western coasts of Morocco and Portugal, and Namibia in southern Africa.

==Actinoform clouds and drizzle prediction==

Researchers have discovered that the cloud fields forming June Gloom and related phenomena from other west-coast marine-influenced climates are excellent places to find and study actinoform clouds. These clouds have been found to be present more often than expected in common stratocumulus layers. These clouds are persistent year-round off the coast, but are only drawn inland during June Gloom events and related phenomena elsewhere in the world. Observations suggest that when marine stratus is present alone, drizzle is minimized. However, scientists believe that the presence of actinoform clouds within the marine stratus is indicative of an increase in drizzle and the onset of precipitation. Observation and computer modeling have shown that the shape of the cloud fields actually rearrange themselves when the clouds start to rain.

<text>The Rainier Brewing Company is an American owned beer brand, originally established in Seattle, Washington. Rainier Beer remains a popular brand in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Although Rainier was founded in 1884, the Seattle site had been brewing beer since 1878. The beer is not currently brewed in Seattle, nor is the company owned locally, but remains American owned with a Seattle-based sales and marketing team. After a series of ownership transfers starting in the 1970s, the company was sold to Stroh&#x27;s and then to Pabst Brewing Company by the late 1990s. The brewery was closed by Pabst in 1999 and sold, while Rainier beer continues to be sold by Pabst.
The brewery itself is a well-known fixture in the south end of town, adjacent to I-5 just north of the Spokane Street Viaduct. The plant was home to the Tully&#x27;s Coffee headquarters, Bartholomew Winery, Red Soul Motorcycle Fabrications, as well as artist lofts, band practice spaces, and a recording studio. The trademark red neon &quot;R&quot; that sat atop the building was replaced with a green &quot;T&quot; built by local Seattle sign company Western Neon, when Tully&#x27;s was using the plant to roast coffee. The neon &quot;R&quot;, also refurbished by Western Neon, is now on display at Seattle&#x27;s Museum of History and Industry. The green &quot;T&quot; was removed on September 30, 2013 by Tully&#x27;s, and a red neon replica &quot;R&quot;, built by Western Neon, returned to the top of the brewery on October 24, 2013. The Rainier brand is currently owned and operated by Pabst Brewing Company. In Canada, it is owned, brewed, and distributed by Sleeman Breweries as Rainier Lager.

==History==

===Origins===
The original brewery dates all the way back to 1854 when A.B. Rabbeson opened Washington Brewery, which was Seattle’s first commercial brewing company. In 1872, Rabbeson renamed his brewery Seattle Brewery. They launched Rainier beer in 1878 and would produce and distribute Rainier for the next decade. Concurrently, John Kopp and Andrew Hemrich founded the Bay View Brewing Company in 1883, with Kopp&#x27;s interest soon being bought out by Hemrich&#x27;s father John, who had previously operated a brewery in Alma, Wisconsin; the rest of the Hemrich clan would soon relocate to Seattle, either joining Andrew&#x27;s brewery or starting new ones. In 1888, Rabbeson sold his brewery, along with the Rainier brand, to Hemrich. In 1893 the Seattle Brewing &amp; Malting Company would be formed by the merger of the Bay View brewery with the Claussen &amp; Sweeney brewery at Georgetown and the Albert Braun Brewing Company located further south. Andrew Hemrich would become president of the new company and remain until his death in 1910; he would be succeeded by his brother Louis Hemrich. The Georgetown brewery would become the headquarters of the new corporation and the brewery itself would undergo a major period of construction in the early 1900s making it one of the largest in the world.

===The Prohibition era===
The Hemrichs produced Rainier beer in Washington until 1916, when the state of Washington enacted its own prohibition, 4 years before the 18th amendment enacted the nationwide prohibition. During this time they opened a brewery in San Francisco where they brewed Rainier beer until 1920 when the 18th amendment was ratified. The company survived prohibition by producing a variety of different nonalcoholic products. In Seattle they would maintain the Georgetown brewery as little more than a distribution center and would lease the Bay View branch out as a feed mill.

===Post-Prohibition relaunch===
Following the repeal of the Prohibition, the Bay View brewery was purchased by Lethbridge, Alberta brewers Fritz and Emil Sick, who then repurchased the Rainier brand and began brewing Rainier in 1935. The brewery went through several names, such as Sicks&#x27; Seattle Brewing and Malting and Sicks&#x27; Rainier Brewing Company, during the 1935–1977 period.
After Rainier Brewing Company resumed producing &quot;Rainier Beer&quot; after the end of Prohibition and its advertisements became ubiquitous in the Seattle-Tacoma area, a rumor began circulating that the brewery&#x27;s owner, Emil Sick, had bribed a Washington state committee with free beer to name the local mountain &quot;Rainier&quot;. This, however, is an urban legend and can still be heard today among Tacoma residents who preferred the alternate name of &quot;Mount Tacoma&quot;. Sick did, however, purchase the local baseball team and named them the Seattle Rainiers for this purpose.

Sicks also brewed Rainier at a branch brewery in Spokane, which closed in 1962.

===Creative packaging===

From 1952 to 1964, Rainier came packaged in a series of decorative beer cans known as the Rainier Jubilee Series. First in the series were a set of Christmas cans marketed in late 1952 and again in late 1953; these cans are rare and highly collectible today. The Christmas cans proved such a success that Rainier&#x27;s use of decorative Jubilee Series cans continued for over a decade, with thousands of different designs. Most of these are not as rare and collectible as the Christmas cans, but the &quot;reindeer&quot; cans (which were sold only in Alaska), and the first pull tab Jubilee cans (made only in the last couple of years of the Jubilee Series) are also considered rare.

Other brands of beer brewed by Sick&#x27;s Rainier Brewing during this time included Rheinlander and Sick&#x27;s Select. Later, the Rainier brewery would also take over brewing Heidelberg beer after its brewery in Tacoma, Washington, closed. Each of these brands (as well as rival Northwest brands Lucky Lager, Olympia, and Blitz-Weinhard) were once staples in the Pacific Northwest beer market, but starting in the 1960s and 1970s began losing market share to the major national brands.

===1970s and 1980s advertising campaigns===
During the 1970s, Rainier ran a number of memorable television ads in the Pacific Northwest, largely conceived by Seattle designer Terry Heckler, assisted by several of his staff, especially Ed Leimbacher, writer/producer for Rainier print, radio and TV for a dozen years. Sound man Joe Hadlock of Bear Creek Studio joined the colleagues of Heckler Bowker for 14 years of creating noise and music for these advertisements.

Some of these surrealist advertisements noted by &quot;Seattle Magazine&quot; included the Running of the MFRs (Mountain Fresh Rainiers) (a parody of Running of the Bulls featuring bottles with legs), and frogs that croaked &quot;Rainier Beer&quot; (a motif appropriated many years later by Budweiser). Mickey Rooney appeared in several TV ads, most notably a parody of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; from the 1936 MGM film &quot;Rose Marie&quot;. Mickey was dressed in a Mountie costume alongside his wife Jan as they sang. (Most airings of this commercial ended with Rooney pouring a bottle of Rainier into her proffered glass, but occasionally a version was aired in which he poured the beer into her cleavage.) A commercial ad featured a motorcycle that revved &quot;Raiiiiiiiii-nieeeeeeeer-Beeeeeeeer&quot; while zooming by along a mountain road was notable in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A version of this commercial that played on radio featured the sounds of different brands of motorcycles making the &quot;Rainier Beer&quot; revving sound.

Other ads featured a Lawrence Welk double (played by actor Pat Harrington, Jr.) leading his band in &quot;The Wunnerful Rainier Waltz&quot;, complete with bubble machine and soloists blowing on beer bottles; and a performance of a parody of the song &quot;You&#x27;re the Tops&quot; while thousands of Rainier bottle caps fell like dominoes in a giant &quot;R&quot; frame. (The whole commercial was reportedly shot on the first take, a great relief since it took all day to set up.) Rainier also produced humorous posters such as a &quot;National Beergraphic&quot; parody of a &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; cover depicting tourists encountering an MFR in the forest, and a &quot;Flash Gordon/Star Wars&quot; poster, &quot;Fresh Wars&quot;, that recalled the bar scene in &quot;Star Wars: Episode 4&quot;. There were even costumed MFRs that made promotional appearances at supermarkets during this period.

Several commercials were parodies of movies, TV shows and famous spokespeople of the time. For example, a couple made references to popular &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skits: one with a Gilda Radner lookalike in her role as Roseanne Roseanneadanna in a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; skit for Rainier Lite commercial; another had characters called the R-Heads, which was a reference to the Coneheads, with Rainier &#x27;R&#x27; logos on the top of their heads. Two commercials featured a Tarzan character where his yell is &quot;Raaaiiinn-iiieeer!&quot;. A commercial featured a silhouette of Alfred Hitchcock who would morph into a beer bottle. Another commercial featured a John Houseman imitator when Houseman at the time was a spokesperson for Smith Barney. Another series of commercials featured a Lee Iacocca impersonator walking through stacks of beer cans. One final series of commercials was the Rambo like character called &quot;R-bo&quot;, played by Dan Roland. The &quot;R-bo&quot; commercials were filmed in three parts; only two of those commercials aired, however. The third commercial was never seen, because Rainier Brewery was bought out by another brewing company which did not choose to continue the campaign .

===Decline and sale===

In 1977, the Rainier brewery was sold to G. Heileman Brewing Company, and passed through several more hands before finally winding up owned by Pabst, which closed it in 1999. The Rainier brand was sold to General Brewing Company, which moved production to the Olympia brewery in nearby Tumwater, Washington. The Olympia Brewing Company closed in 2003. Rainier Beer is now brewed by Pabst in Irwindale, California.

In 1999, Sleeman Breweries of Guelph, Ontario, a division of Sapporo Breweries, acquired Stroh Canada which owned the Canadian rights to a folio of brands, including Rainier. Sleeman then became the Canadian manufacturer and distributor.

In 2023, Rainier is set to deliver more beer to retailers than any prior year since Pabst acquired Rainier in 1999.

===Awards===
In 1987, Rainier was awarded a silver medal by the Great American Beer Festival in the category of Best American Light Lager. The GABF recognized Rainier again in 1990, 1998, and 2000 with the gold medal for Best American-Style Lager as well as silver medals in the same category in 2003 and 2005. Both Rainier Light and Rainier Ice have received medals, in their respective categories, from the GABF.

==Rainier &quot;R&quot; logo==

The red Rainier &quot;R&quot; logo has become an icon of the Rainier Brewing Company, dating back to the 1900s. The logo has gone through a few redesigns, having adopted the current &quot;R&quot; logo since the 1950s. Before that, the logo contained baseball style word mark with the &quot;R&quot; logo, shown in early 1900s advertisements up until the 1950s. After that, the word mark changed to go with the revised &quot;R&quot; logo, and it is still being used today. In 1953, a large red neon &quot;R&quot; logo sign was created and placed atop the brewery. After Tully&#x27;s leased the brewery in 2000, they replaced the iconic &quot;R&quot; with a green neon Tully&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; sign. The original red &quot;R&quot; sign was sold to the Museum of History &amp; Industry (MOHAI), in which it is now on display at its new location at South Lake Union, Seattle. On September 18, 2013, Tully&#x27;s (under new owners) decided to replace the green &quot;T&quot; with a replica of the red &quot;R&quot; sign. The green &quot;T&quot; sign was removed on September 30, 2013, and the new red &quot;R&quot; sign was installed on October 24, 2013. The replica &quot;R&quot; sign is different from the original &quot;R&quot; sign; along with the new &quot;R&quot; having lights on both sides, the new sign is made of lighter aluminium, and it has LED lights, requiring them to only replace the lights every five to seven years.
==In popular culture==
* In the 1986 film &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland) and his friends drink Rainier beer while playing mailbox baseball. 
* In the 1995 film &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, Robert ( Clint Eastwood) drinks Rainier Beer at Francesca&#x27;s (Meryl Streep) kitchen table.
* The Seattle grunge group Mudhoney was humorously photographed in 1988 with cans of Rainier Beer. The image can be seen on the inside CD cover of the band&#x27;s &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot; + Early Singles release.
* In the 2008 film &quot;Twilight&quot;, set in Forks, Washington, Rainier beer appears prominently in several scenes, and is referred to as &quot;Vitamin R&quot;. Character Charlie Swan is seen drinking the beer in subsequent films in the &quot;Twilight&quot; series.
* In 2004, a black bear received substantial media attention for having consumed 36 cans of Rainier beer in Baker Lake, Washington. After gaining access to a cooler of beer that belonged to campers, the bear avoided cans of Busch beer and used its claws and teeth to open and then consume the cans of Rainier. A wildlife agent said at the time that &quot;this is a new one on me ... I&#x27;ve known them to get into cans, but nothing like this. And it definitely had a preference.&quot;
* In the A&amp;E 2012 television series &quot;Longmire&quot;, the series&#x27; main character Sheriff Walt Longmire exclusively drinks Rainier beer, and can be seen drinking it throughout the series. In the pilot episode, a colleague accuses Longmire of drunk driving after empty beer cans are found in his car; Longmire explains the presence of the empty beer cans by saying &quot;Every man who&#x27;s ever had a beer with me will tell you the same thing—I drink Rainier, always have, always will. Those beer cans, they weren&#x27;t Rainier, none of them. I picked &#x27;em up because I hate looking at litter. Everyone knows that, too.&quot; In the third episode of season four, a person tries to frame Longmire for a crime by leaving an empty can of Rainier at the scene.
* The beer reached No. 1 on the list of top 100 beers by Cold Cans.
* A pack of Rainier features in the cover photo of the Zach Bryan album &quot;Elisabeth&quot; from the song of the same name.

<doc id="819467" wikidata="Q41492" url="?curid=819467" title="Fisher's exact test">
<text>Fisher&#x27;s exact test (also Fisher-Irwin test) is a statistical significance test used in the analysis of contingency tables. Although in practice it is employed when sample sizes are small, it is valid for all sample sizes. The test assumes that all row and column sums of the contingency table were fixed by design and tends to be conservative and underpowered outside of this setting. It is one of a class of exact tests, so called because the significance of the deviation from a null hypothesis (e.g., &quot;p&quot;-value) can be calculated exactly, rather than relying on an approximation that becomes exact in the limit as the sample size grows to infinity, as with many statistical tests.

The test is named after its inventor, Ronald Fisher, who is said to have devised the test following a comment from Muriel Bristol, who claimed to be able to detect whether the tea or the milk was added first to her cup. He tested her claim in the &quot;lady tasting tea&quot; experiment.

==Purpose and scope==

The test is useful for categorical data that result from classifying objects in two different ways; it is used to examine the significance of the association (contingency) between the two kinds of classification. So in Fisher&#x27;s original example, one criterion of classification could be whether milk or tea was put in the cup first; the other could be whether Bristol thinks that the milk or tea was put in first. We want to know whether these two classifications are associated—that is, whether Bristol really can tell whether milk or tea was poured in first. Most uses of the Fisher test involve, like this example, a 2 × 2 contingency table (discussed below). The &quot;p&quot;-value from the test is computed as if the margins of the table are fixed, i.e. as if, in the tea-tasting example, Bristol knows the number of cups with each treatment (milk or tea first) and will therefore provide guesses with the correct number in each category. As pointed out by Fisher, this leads under a null hypothesis of independence to a hypergeometric distribution of the numbers in the cells of the table. This setting is however rare in scientific practice and the test is conservative, when one or both margins are random variables themselves

With large samples, a chi-squared test (or better yet, a G-test) can be used in this situation. However, the significance value it provides is only an approximation, because the sampling distribution of the test statistic that is calculated is only approximately equal to the theoretical chi-squared distribution. The approximation is poor when sample sizes are small, or the data are very unequally distributed among the cells of the table, resulting in the cell counts predicted on the null hypothesis (the &quot;expected values&quot;) being low. The usual rule for deciding whether the chi-squared approximation is good enough is that the chi-squared test is not suitable when the expected values in any of the cells of a contingency table are below 5, or below 10 when there is only one degree of freedom (this rule is now known to be overly conservative). In fact, for small, sparse, or unbalanced data, the exact and asymptotic &quot;p&quot;-values can be quite different and may lead to opposite conclusions concerning the hypothesis of interest. In contrast the Fisher exact test is, as its name states, exact as long as the experimental procedure keeps the row and column totals fixed, and it can therefore be used regardless of the sample characteristics. It becomes difficult to calculate with large samples or well-balanced tables, but fortunately these are exactly the conditions where the chi-squared test is appropriate.

For hand calculations, the test is feasible only in the case of a 2 × 2 contingency table. However the principle of the test can be extended to the general case of an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; table, and some statistical packages provide a calculation (sometimes using a Monte Carlo method to obtain an approximation) for the more general case.

The test can also be used to quantify the &quot;overlap&quot; between two sets. 
For example, in enrichment analyses in statistical genetics one set of genes may be annotated for a given phenotype and the user may be interested in testing the overlap of their own set with those.
In this case a 2 × 2 contingency table may be generated and Fisher&#x27;s exact test applied through identifying 
# Genes that are provided in both lists
# Genes that are provided in the first list and not the second
# Genes that are provided in the second list and not the first
# Genes that are not provided in either list
The test assumes genes in either list are taken from a broader set of genes (e.g. all remaining genes).
A &quot;p&quot;-value may then be calculated, summarizing the significance of the overlap between the two lists.

== Derivation ==

{\binom{n}{a+b}}&lt;/math&gt;

Another derivation:

{\binom{n}{a+b}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
For example, a sample of teenagers might be divided into male and female on one hand and those who are and are not currently studying for a statistics exam on the other. For example, we hypothesize that the proportion of studying students is higher among the women than among the men, and we want to test whether any difference in proportions that we observe is significant.

The data might look like this:

The question we ask about these data is: Knowing that 10 of these 24 teenagers are studying and that 12 of the 24 are female, and assuming the null hypothesis that men and women are equally likely to study, what is the probability that these 10 teenagers who are studying would be so unevenly distributed between the women and the men? If we were to choose 10 of the teenagers at random, what is the probability that 9 or more of them would be among the 12 women and only 1 or fewer from among the 12 men?

=== First example ===
Before we proceed with the Fisher test, we first introduce some notations. We represent the cells by the letters &quot;a, b, c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, call the totals across rows and columns &quot;marginal totals&quot;, and represent the grand total by &quot;n&quot;. So the table now looks like this:

Fisher showed that conditional on the margins of the table, &quot;a&quot; is distributed as a hypergeometric distribution with &quot;a+c&quot; draws from a population with &quot;a+b&quot; successes and &quot;c+d&quot; failures. The probability of obtaining such set of values is given by:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the binomial coefficient and the symbol ! indicates the factorial operator.
This can be seen as follows. If the marginal totals (i.e. formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6) are known, only a single degree of freedom is left: the value e.g. of formula_7 suffices to deduce the other values. 
Now, formula_8 is the probability that formula_7 elements are positive in a random selection (without replacement) of formula_5 elements from a larger set containing formula_11 elements in total out of which formula_3 are positive, which is precisely the definition of the hypergeometric distribution.

With the data above (using the first of the equivalent forms), this gives:
formula_13
=== Second example ===
The formula above gives the exact hypergeometric probability of observing this particular arrangement of the data, assuming the given marginal totals, on the null hypothesis that men and women are equally likely to be studiers. To put it another way, if we assume that the probability that a man is a studier is formula_14, the probability that a woman is a studier is also formula_14, and we assume that both men and women enter our sample independently of whether or not they are studiers, then this hypergeometric formula gives the conditional probability of observing the values &quot;a, b, c, d&quot; in the four cells, conditionally on the observed marginals (i.e., assuming the row and column totals shown in the margins of the table are given). This remains true even if men enter our sample with different probabilities than women. The requirement is merely that the two classification characteristics—gender, and studier (or not)—are not associated.

For example, suppose we knew probabilities formula_16 with formula_17 such that (male studier, male non-studier, female studier, female non-studier) had respective probabilities formula_18 for each individual encountered under our sampling procedure. Then still, were we to calculate the distribution of cell entries conditional given marginals, we would obtain the above formula in which neither formula_14 nor formula_20 occurs. Thus, we can calculate the exact probability of any arrangement of the 24 teenagers into the four cells of the table, but Fisher showed that to generate a significance level, we need consider only the cases where the marginal totals are the same as in the observed table, and among those, only the cases where the arrangement is as extreme as the observed arrangement, or more so. (Barnard&#x27;s test relaxes this constraint on one set of the marginal totals.) In the example, there are 11 such cases. Of these only one is more extreme in the same direction as our data; it looks like this:
For this table (with extremely unequal studying proportions) the probability is
formula_21.

=== p-value tests ===
In order to calculate the significance of the observed data, i.e. the total probability of observing data as extreme or more extreme if the null hypothesis is true, we have to calculate the values of &quot;p&quot; for both these tables, and add them together. This gives a one-tailed test, with &quot;p&quot; approximately 0.001346076 + 0.000033652 = 0.001379728. For example, in the R statistical computing environment, this value can be obtained as codice_1, or in Python, using codice_2 (where one receives both the prior odds ratio and the &quot;p&quot;-value). This value can be interpreted as the sum of evidence provided by the observed data—or any more extreme table—for the null hypothesis (that there is no difference in the proportions of studiers between men and women). The smaller the value of &quot;p&quot;, the greater the evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis; so here the evidence is strong that men and women are not equally likely to be studiers.

For a two-tailed test we must also consider tables that are equally extreme, but in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, classification of the tables according to whether or not they are &#x27;as extreme&#x27; is problematic. An approach used by the codice_3 function in R is to compute the &quot;p&quot;-value by summing the probabilities for all tables with probabilities less than or equal to that of the observed table. In the example here, the 2-sided &quot;p&quot;-value is twice the 1-sided value—but in general these can differ substantially for tables with small counts, unlike the case with test statistics that have a symmetric sampling distribution.

==Controversies==
Fisher&#x27;s test gives exact &quot;p&quot;-values, but some authors have argued that it is conservative, i.e. that its actual rejection rate is below the nominal significance level. The apparent contradiction stems from the combination of a discrete statistic with fixed significance levels. Consider the following proposal for a significance test at the 5%-level: reject the null hypothesis for each table to which Fisher&#x27;s test assigns a &quot;p&quot;-value equal to or smaller than 5%. Because the set of all tables is discrete, there may not be a table for which equality is achieved. If formula_22 is the largest &quot;p&quot;-value smaller than 5% which can actually occur for some table, then the proposed test effectively tests at the formula_22-level. For small sample sizes, formula_22 might be significantly lower than 5%. While this effect occurs for any discrete statistic (not just in contingency tables, or for Fisher&#x27;s test), it has been argued that the problem is compounded by the fact that Fisher&#x27;s test conditions on the marginals. To avoid the problem, many authors discourage the use of fixed significance levels when dealing with discrete problems.

The decision to condition on the margins of the table is also controversial. The &quot;p&quot;-values derived from Fisher&#x27;s test come from the distribution that conditions on the margin totals. In this sense, the test is exact only for the conditional distribution and not the original table where the margin totals may change from experiment to experiment. It is possible to obtain an exact &quot;p&quot;-value for the 2×2 table when the margins are not held fixed. Barnard&#x27;s test, for example, allows for random margins. However, some authors (including, later, Barnard himself) have criticized Barnard&#x27;s test based on this property. They argue that the marginal success total is an (almost) ancillary statistic, containing (almost) no information about the tested property.

The act of conditioning on the marginal success rate from a 2×2 table can be shown to ignore some information in the data about the unknown odds ratio. The argument that the marginal totals are (almost) ancillary implies that the appropriate likelihood function for making inferences about this odds ratio should be conditioned on the marginal success rate. Whether this lost information is important for inferential purposes is the essence of the controversy.

==Alternatives==
An alternative exact test, Barnard&#x27;s exact test, has been developed and proponents of it suggest that this method is more powerful, particularly in 2×2 tables. Furthermore, Boschloo&#x27;s test is an exact test that is uniformly more powerful than Fisher&#x27;s exact test by construction.

Most modern statistical packages will calculate the significance of Fisher tests, in some cases even where the chi-squared approximation would also be acceptable. The actual computations as performed by statistical software packages will as a rule differ from those described above, because numerical difficulties may result from the large values taken by the factorials. A simple, somewhat better computational approach relies on a gamma function or log-gamma function, but methods for accurate computation of hypergeometric and binomial probabilities remains an active research area.

For stratified categorical data the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test must be used instead of Fisher&#x27;s test.

Choi et al. propose a &quot;p&quot;-value derived from the likelihood ratio test based on the conditional distribution of the odds ratio given the marginal success rate. This &quot;p&quot;-value is inferentially consistent with classical tests of normally distributed data as well as with likelihood ratios and support intervals based on this conditional likelihood function. It is also readily computable.

<text>Gunnar Johansson (1911–1998) was a Swedish psychophysicist. 

==Biography==
He was interested in the Gestalt laws of motion perception in vision. He is best known for his investigations of biological motion. He helped develop the rigidity assumption which posits that proximal stimuli that can be perceived as rigid objects are generally perceived as such. Johansson received his Ph.D. from the Stockholm University College in 1950, on the thesis &quot;Configurations in event perception&quot;. He was professor of psychology at Uppsala University from 1957 to 1977. In 1970, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences.

<text>Kabyle () or Kabylian (; native name: &quot;Taqbaylit&quot; ) is a Berber language spoken by the Kabyle people in the north and northeast of Algeria. It is spoken primarily in Kabylia, east of the capital Algiers and in Algiers itself, but also by various groups near Blida, such as the Beni Salah and Beni Bou Yaqob.

Estimating the number of Berber speakers is very difficult and figures are often contested. A 2004 estimate was that 9.4% of the Algerian population speaks Kabyle. The diaspora population has been estimated at one million.

==Classification==

Kabyle is one of the Berber languages, a family within the Afroasiatic languages. It is believed to have broken off very early from Proto-Berber, although after the Zenaga language did so.

==Distribution==
=== Geographical distribution ===

Kabyle Berber is native to Kabylia. It is present in seven Algerian districts. Approximately one-third of Algerians are Berber-speakers, clustered mostly near Algiers, in Kabylian and Shawi, but with some communities related to Kabyle in the west (Shenwa languages), east and south of the country. The populations of Béjaïa (Bgayet), Bouïra (Tubirett) and Tizi Ouzou (Tizi Wezzu) provinces are in majority Kabyle-speaking. In addition, Kabyle is mainly spoken in the provinces of Boumerdès, and as well as in Bordj Bou Arréridj, Jijel, and in Algiers where it coexists with Algerian Arabic.

Kabyle Berber is also spoken as a native language among the Algerian Kabyle-descended diaspora in European and North American cities (mainly France). It is estimated that half of Kabyles live outside the Kabylian region.

=== Number of speakers ===
Estimates on the number of Kabyle speakers in the region vary widely, with different dates and data given for different points of time. As such the number of Kabyle speakers varies considerably depending on different sources given. French ethnologist estimates four million Kabyle speakers in 2001 in Algeria. According to the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Linguistics&quot; there were million speakers in Kabylia in 2003 out of million worldwide. In 2004, Canadian linguist estimated that there were million Kabyle speakers in Algeria (9.4% of the total Algerian population) and in France. Salem Chaker estimated there were 5.5 million speakers in 2004, including 3 to 3.5 in Kabylia. The &quot;Encyclopædia Universalis&quot; gives 7 million Kabyle speakers. The French Ministry of Culture estimated there were one million Kabyle speakers in France in 2013. Linguist Matthias Brenzinger estimates the number of Kabyle speakers in Algeria at between 2.5 and 3 million in 2015. Bruce Maddy-Weitzman&#x27;s 2018 estimate is more than 5 million Kabyle speakers in Kabylie. Linguist Asya Pereltsvaig gives 5.6 million Kabyle speakers worldwide in 2020, mostly in Algeria. In 2021, Amina Mettouchi, professor of Berber linguistics, estimated the number of speakers at five million worldwide and more than three million in Algeria. In 2022, according to &quot;Ethnologue&quot; there were million speakers worldwide, including million in Algeria.

===Dialects===
Many identify two dialects: Greater Kabylie (west) and Lesser Kabylie (east), but the reality is more complex than that, Kabyle dialects constitute a dialect continuum that can be divided into four main dialects (from west to east):

*Far-western: villages such as Tizi-Ghennif, Boghni and Draa el Mizan.
*Western: villages such as At Menguellat, At Yiraten, At Aïssi, At Yanni, 
*Eastern: 
** Eastern-West: villages such as At Mlikeche, Eastern-center: At Aïdel, At Khiar
** Eastern-East: villages such as At Sliman.
*Far-eastern: villages such as Aokas, Melbou, At Smail. Also known as Tasaḥlit and considered as a separate language by some according to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;. Mutual intelligibility with Far-western is difficult to absent.

====Lexical differences====

With the exception of the far-eastern dialect, much of the vocabulary of Kabyle is common across its dialects, though some lexical differences exist, e.g. the word &quot;dream&quot; in English (from west to east): bargu, argu, argu, bureg.

==Status and usage==

=== Multilingualism and language shift ===
Almost all Berber speakers are multilingual, in Arabic and often also in French. Kabyle is still strong in villages but urban Kabyles in Algeria are increasingly shifting to Arabic and diaspora Kabyles to the surrounding language. A 2013 study found that 54% of Kabyles living in Oran spoke Arabic to their siblings.

=== Official status ===

After the 2001–02 widespread Kabyle protests known as the Black Spring, the Berber (Amazigh) language (with all its Algerian dialects and varieties) was recognized as a &#x27;national language&#x27; in the 2002 Algerian Constitution, but not as an &#x27;official language&#x27; until 2016 after a long campaign by activists. French is not recognized in any legal document of Algeria but enjoys a &quot;de facto&quot; position of an official language as it is used in every Algerian official administration or institution, at all levels of the government, sometimes much more than Arabic.

The Berber (Amazigh) language faces an unfavourable environment, despite a public radio in Algeria (Channel II, which dates back to 1925), as well as a public TV channel in Morocco (Channel IV or Tamazight TV). Since private ownership of TV channels is illegal in Algeria, Kabyles have launched a private Kabyle speaking TV channel, called &quot;Berbère Television&quot;, that broadcasts from France. There is no Kabyle newspaper. Some Algerian newspapers such as offer a small Kabyle section.

In 1994, Kabyle pupils and students boycotted Algerian schools for a year, demanding the officialization of Berber, leading to the symbolic creation of the &quot;Haut commissariat à l&#x27;amazighité&quot; (HCA) in 1995. Berber was subsequently taught as a non-compulsory language in Berber speaking areas. The course being optional, few people attend. The Kabyle school boycott also resulted in the first recognition of Amazigh as a national language in November 1996.

President Bouteflika has frequently stated that &quot;Amazigh (the Berber language) will never be an official language, and if it has to be a national language, it must be submitted to a referendum&quot;. In 2005, President Bouteflika, stated that &quot;there is no country in the world with two official languages&quot; and &quot;this will never be the case of Algeria&quot;. Nevertheless, after four decades of pacific struggle, riots, strikes, and social mobilization, including the Berber spring (1980, riots and strikes in the Kabylie region of Tizi Ouzou, Bouira and Bejaïa, as well as Algiers) and the Black Spring in 2001, President Bouteflika and his government recognized Amazigh (Berber) as a &quot;national language&quot; for the second time through a 2002 constitutional amendment.

In February 2016, the Algerian constitution passed a resolution that made Berber an official language alongside Arabic.

==Phonology==

The phonemes below reflect the pronunciation of Kabyle.

===Vowels===
Kabyle has three phonemic vowels:

 is used to write the epenthetic schwa vowel which occurs frequently in Kabyle. Historically, it is thought to be the result of a pan-Berber reduction or merger of three other vowels.

The phonetic realization of the vowels, especially , is influenced by the character of the surrounding consonants; emphatic consonants invite a more open realization of the vowel, e.g. aẓru = &#x27;stone&#x27; vs. amud = &#x27;seed&#x27;. Often /a, i, u/ are realized as .

===Consonants===
====Assimilation====
In the Kabyle language there are various accents which are the result of assimilations (these accents are generally divided into western and eastern Kabyle). Some of these assimilations are present among all Kabyle &quot;dialects&quot; and some not. These assimilations are not noted in writing, such as:

*&quot;Axxam n wergaz&quot; (&quot;the house of the man&quot;) is pronounced either &quot;axxam n wergaz&quot;, &quot;axxam bb wergaz&quot; or &quot;axxam pp wergaz&quot;. (N+W=BB)
*&quot;D taqcict&quot; (&quot;it&#x27;s a girl&quot;) is pronounced &quot;tsaqcict&quot;. (D+T=TS)
*Here is a list of some of these assimilations: D/T+T=TS, N+W=BB/PP, I+Y=IG.

Gemination affects the quality of certain consonants, turning semivowels and fricatives into stops; in particular, geminated &quot;ɣ&quot; becomes &quot;qq&quot;, geminated &quot;y&quot; becomes &quot;gg&quot;, and geminated &quot;w&quot; becomes &quot;bb&quot;.

====Fricatives vs. stops====
Kabyle is mostly composed of fricatives, phonemes which are originally stops in other Berber languages, but in writing there is no difference between fricatives and stops. Below is a list of fricatives vs. stops and when they are pronounced (note that gemination turns fricatives into stops).

==Writing system==


The most ancient Berber writings were written in the Libyco-Berber script, mostly from Numidian and Roman times. This script was an abjad, and is not yet completely deciphered today. Deciphered scripts are mostly funerary, following a simple formula of &quot;X son of Y&quot; (X u Y) which is still used to this day in the Kabyle language. Such writings have been found in Kabylie (also known as Kabylia) and continue to be discovered by archeologists. The Tifinagh script of the Tuaregs was a direct continuation of this earlier script.

The Libyco-Berber alphabet disappeared in the region of Kabylia by the sixth century, when Latin became the official and administrative language in North Africa, as in the rest of the former Roman empire.

Kabyle became a mostly spoken language after the Arabic conquest of North Africa, and while many examples of the Kabyle language written in a form of Berber-Arabic script survive, the number of Kabyle texts was relatively much smaller than those written in other Berber languages such as Shilha, Mozabite, and Nafusi.

The first French–Kabyle dictionary was compiled by a French ethnologist in the 18th century. It was written in Latin script with an orthography based on that of French.

However, the Kabyle language really became a written language again in the beginning of the 19th century. Under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the Latin script. &quot;Tamacahutt n wuccen&quot; by Brahim Zellal was one of the first Kabyle books written using this alphabet.

After the independence of Algeria, some Kabyle activists tried to revive the Libyco-Berber script, which is still in use by the Tuareg. Attempts were made to modernize the writing system by modifying the shape of the letters and by adding vowels. This new version of Tifinagh has been called Neo-Tifinagh and has been adopted as the official script for Berber languages in Morocco. However, a majority of Berber activists (both in Morocco and Algeria) prefer the Latin script and see the Tifinagh as a hindrance to literacy in Berber. Kabyle literature continues to be written in Latin script. The use of Tifinagh is limited to logos.

Mouloud Mammeri codified a new orthography for the Kabyle language which avoided using French orthography. His script has been adopted by all Berber linguists, the INALCO, and the Algerian HCA. It uses diacritics and two letters from the extended Latin alphabet: Čč Ḍḍ Ɛɛ Ǧǧ Ɣɣ Ḥḥ Ṣṣ Ṭṭ Ẓẓ.

== Grammar ==
===Nouns===

Kabyle has two genders: masculine and feminine. As in most Berber languages, masculine nouns and adjectives generally start with a vowel (&quot;a-&quot;, &quot;i-&quot;, &quot;u-&quot;), while feminine nouns generally start with &quot;t-&quot; and end with a &quot;-t&quot;, e.g. aqcic &#x27;boy&#x27; vs. taqcict &#x27;girl&#x27;.

Plurals generally are formed by replacing initial &quot;a-&quot; with &quot;i-&quot;, and either suffixing &quot;-en&quot; (&quot;regular/external&quot; plurals), changing vowels within the word (&quot;broken/internal&quot; plurals), or both. Examples: 
::argaz → irgazen &quot;men&quot;
::adrar → idurar &quot;mountains&quot;
::afus → ifassen &quot;hands&quot;

As in all Berber languages, Kabyle has two types of states or cases of the noun: &quot;free state&quot; and construct state (or &#x27;annexed state&#x27;). The free state is morphologically unmarked. The construct state is derived either by changing initial /a-/ to /u-/, loss of initial vowel in some feminine nouns, addition of a semi-vowel word-initially, or in some cases no change occurs at all:
::&quot;a&quot;drar → wedrar &quot;mountain&quot;
::tamdint → temdint &quot;town&quot;
::tamurt → tmurt &quot;country&quot;
::asif → wasif &quot;river&quot;
::iles → yiles &quot;tongue&quot;
::taddart → taddart &quot;village&quot;

As in Central Morocco Tamazight, construct state is used for subjects placed after their verbs, after prepositions, in noun complement constructions, and after certain numerals. Kabyle also places nouns in construct state when they head a noun phrase containing a co-referential bound pronoun earlier in the utterance.

Examples:

*Free: &quot;Yewwet aqcic&quot;. &quot;He has beaten a boy&quot;. (Verb–object)
*Annexed: &quot;Yewwet weqcic&quot;. &quot;The boy has beaten&quot;. (Verb–subject)

After a preposition (with the exception of &quot;ar&quot; and &quot;s&quot;), all nouns take their annexed state:

*Free state: Aman (water), Kas n waman (a glass of water).

=== Verbs ===

Verbs are conjugated for three tenses: the preterite (past), intensive aorist (present perfect, present continuous, past continuous) and the future (ad+aorist). Unlike other Berber languages, the aorist alone is rarely used in Kabyle (in the other languages it is used to express the present).

*&quot;Weak verbs&quot; have a preterite form that is the same as their aorist. Examples of weak verbs that follow are conjugated at the first person of the singular:

*&quot;Strong verbs&quot; or &quot;irregular verbs&quot;:



Verbs are conjugated for person by adding affixes. These suffixes are static and identical for all tenses (only the theme changes). The epenthetic vowel &quot;e&quot; may be inserted between the affix and the verb. Verbs are always marked for subject and may also inflect for person of direct and indirect object.

Examples:
: « Yuɣ-it. » – &quot;He bought it.&quot; (He.bought-it)
: « Yenna-yas. » – &quot;He said to him.&quot; (He.said-to.him)
: « Yefka-yas-t. » – &quot;He gave it to him.&quot; (He.gave-to.him-it)

Kabyle is a satellite-framed based language, Kabyle verbs use two particles to show the path of motion:
*&quot;d&quot; orients toward the speaker, and could be translated as &quot;here&quot;.
*&quot;n&quot; orients toward the interlocutor or toward a certain place, and could be translated as &quot;there&quot;.

Examples:
* « iruḥ-d » (he came), « iruḥ-n » (he went).
* « awi-d aman» (bring the water), « awi-n aman » (carry away the water).

Kabyle usually expresses negation in two parts, with the particle &quot;ur&quot; attached to the verb, and one or more negative words that modify the verb or one of its arguments. For example, simple verbal negation is expressed by « &quot;ur&quot; » before the verb and the particle « &quot;ara&quot; » after the verb:
*« Urareɣ » (&quot;I played&quot;) → « Ur urareɣ ara » (&quot;I did not play&quot;)
Other negative words (acemma... etc.) are used in combination with &quot;ur&quot; to express more complex types of negation. This system developed via Jespersen&#x27;s cycle.

Verb derivation is performed by adding affixes. There are three types of derivation forms: causative, reflexive and passive.

*Causative: obtained by prefixing the verb with s- / sse- / ssu-:
::ffeɣ &quot;to go out&quot; → ssuffeɣ &quot;to make to go out&quot;
::kcem &quot;to enter&quot; → ssekcem &quot;to make to enter, to introduce&quot;
::irid &quot;to be washed&quot; → ssired &quot;to wash&quot;.
*Reflexive: obtained by prefixing the verb with m- / my(e)- / myu-:
::ẓer &quot;to see&quot; → mẓer &quot;to see each other&quot;
::ṭṭef &quot;to hold&quot; → myuṭṭaf &quot;to hold each other&quot;.
*Passive: is obtained by prefixing the verb with ttu- / ttwa- / tt- / mm(e)- / n- / nn-:
::krez &quot;to plough&quot; → ttwakrez &quot;to be ploughed&quot;
::ečč &quot;to eat&quot; → mmečč &quot;to be eaten&quot;.
*Complex forms: obtained by combining two or more of the previous prefixes:
::enɣ &quot;to kill&quot; → mmenɣ &quot;to kill each other&quot; → smenɣ &quot;to make to kill each other&quot;
Two prefixes can cancel each other:
::enz &quot;to be sold&quot; → zzenz &quot;to sell&quot; → ttuzenz &quot;to be sold&quot; (ttuzenz = enz !!).

Every verb has a corresponding agent noun. In English it could be translated into verb+er. It is obtained by prefixing the verb with « am- » or with « an- » if the first letter is b / f / m / w (there are exceptions, however).

*Examples:
::ṭṭef &quot;to hold&quot; → anaṭṭaf &quot;holder&quot;
::inig &quot;to travel&quot; → iminig &quot;traveller&quot;
::eks &quot;to graze&quot; → ameksa &quot;shepherd&quot;

Verbal nouns are derived differently from different classes of verbal stems (including &#x27;quality verbs&#x27;). Often &quot;a-&quot; or &quot;t(u)-&quot; is prefixed:
::ffer &quot;to hide&quot; → tuffra &quot;hiding&quot; (stem VI), « Tuffra n tidett ur telhi » – &quot;Hiding the truth is bad&quot;.
::ɣeẓẓ &quot;to bite&quot; → aɣẓaẓ
::zdi &quot;to be united&quot; → azday
::ini &quot;to say&quot; → timenna

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns may either occur as standalone words or bound to nouns or verbs.

Example: « Ula d nekk. » – &quot;Me too.&quot;

Possessive pronouns are bound to the modified noun.

Example : « Axxam-nneɣ. » – &quot;Our house.&quot; (House-our)

There are three demonstratives, near-deictic (&#x27;this, these&#x27;), far-deictic (&#x27;that, those&#x27;) and absence. They may either be suffixed to nouns, or appear in isolation. Examples: « Axxam-a / Axxam-agi» – &quot;This house.&quot;, (House-this), «Wagi yelha» – &quot;This is nice.&quot; (This is-nice).

===Prepositions===
Prepositions precede their objects: « &quot;i medden&quot; » &quot;to the people&quot;, « &quot;si taddart&quot; » &quot;from the village&quot;. All words preceded by a preposition (except « &quot;s&quot; » and « &quot;ar&quot; », &quot;towards&quot;, &quot;until&quot; ) take the annexed state.

Some prepositions have two forms: one is used with pronominal suffixes and the other form is used in all other contexts, e.g. &quot;ger&quot; &#x27;between&#x27; → &quot;gar&quot;.

Some prepositions have a corresponding relative pronoun (or interrogative), for example: 
::« i » &quot;for/to&quot; → « iwumi » &quot;to whom&quot;
::« Tefka aksum i wemcic » &quot;she gave meat to the cat&quot; → « Amcic iwumi tefka aksum » &quot;The cat to whom she gave meat.&quot;

=== Syntax ===
Negation

Predicative particle &#x27;d&#x27;

The predicative particle &#x27;d&#x27; is an indispensable tool in speaking Kabyle (or any other Amazigh language). &quot;d&quot; is equivalent to both &quot;it is + adjective&quot; and &quot;to be + adjective&quot;, but cannot be replaced by the verb &quot;ili&quot; (to be). It is always followed by a noun in free state.

Examples:
*&quot;D taqcict&quot; &#x27;it&#x27;s a girl&#x27;
*&quot;D nekk&quot; &#x27;it&#x27;s me&#x27;
*&quot;Nekk d argaz&quot; &#x27;I&#x27;m a man&#x27;
*&quot;Idir d anelmad&quot; &#x27;Idir is a student&#x27;
*&quot;Idir yella d anelmad&quot; &#x27;Idir was a student&#x27;

The predicative particle &quot;d&quot; should not be confused with the particle of coordination &quot;d&quot;; indeed, the latter is followed by a noun at its annexed state while the first is always followed by a noun at its free state.

==Vocabulary==
Kabyle has absorbed Arabic, French, Latin, Greek and Punic vocabulary. Arabic loanwords representing 22.7% to 46% of the total Kabyle vocabulary, with many estimates putting it at about 35%. The number of French loanwords has not been studied yet. These loanwords are sometimes Berberized and sometimes kept in their original form. The Berberized words follow the regular grammar of Kabyle (free and annexed state).

Examples of Berberized Arabic or French words:

:&quot;kitāb&quot; (Ar.) &gt; &quot;taktabt&quot; &quot;book&quot;
:&quot;machine&quot; (Fr.) &gt; &quot;tamacint&quot; &quot;machine&quot;

Many loanwords from Arabic have often a different meaning in Kabyle:

:&quot;al-māl&quot; &quot;property&quot; (Ar.) &gt; &quot;lmal&quot; &quot;domestic animals&quot; (cf. the etymologies of English &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;)

All verbs of Arabic origin follow a Berber conjugation and verbal derivation:

: &quot;fahim&quot; (Ar.) &gt; &quot;fhem&quot; &quot;to understand&quot; &gt; &quot;ssefhem&quot; &quot;to explain&quot;.

There are &quot;yiwen&quot; (f. &quot;yiwet&quot;) &quot;one&quot;, &quot;sin&quot; (f. &quot;snat&quot;) &quot;two&quot;. The noun being counted follows it in the genitive: &quot;sin n yirgazen&quot; &quot;two men&quot;.

==Sample text==
In Moulieras (Auguste), &quot;Les fourberies de Si Djeh&#x27;a.&quot;







Note: the predicative particle d was translated as &quot;it.is&quot;, the particle of direction d was translated as &quot;here&quot;.

<text>The Tibetan independence movement ( &quot;Bod rang btsan&quot;; ) is the political movement advocating for the reversal of the 1950 annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the separation and independence of Greater Tibet from China.

It is principally led by the Tibetan diaspora in countries like India and the United States, and by celebrities and Tibetan Buddhists in the United States, India and Europe. The Central Tibetan Administration is based in Dharamshala, India.

The Tibetan independence movement is no longer supported by the Central Intelligence Agency, which ended its Tibetan program after the 1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China. Later in the 1970s, the 14th Dalai Lama, who had backed it since 1961, also withdrew his support but now supports The Middle Way Approach.

== Historical background ==


=== Mongol expeditions and rule ===
After the Mongol Prince Köden took control of the Kokonor region in 1239, he sent his general Doorda Darqan on a reconnaissance mission into Tibet in 1240. During this expedition the Kadampa monasteries of Rwa-sgreng and Rgyal-lha-khang were burned, and 500 people killed. The death of the Mongol qaghan Ögedei Khan in 1241 brought Mongol military activity around the world temporarily to a halt. Mongol interests in Tibet resumed in 1244, when Prince Köden sent an invitation to the leader of the Sakya sect, to come to his capital and formally surrender Tibet to the Mongols. The Sakya leader arrived in Kokonor with his two nephews Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (&#x27;Phags-pa; 1235–80) and Chana Dorje (Phyag-na Rdo-rje; 1239–67) in 1246. This event marked the incorporation of Tibet into the Mongol Empire. Tibet was under administrative rule of the Yuan dynasty until the 1350s. At that point, Tibet regained its independence.

=== Qing dynasty ===
In 1720, the Qing dynasty army entered Tibet in aid of the locals and defeated the invading forces of the Dzungar Khanate; thus began the period of Qing rule of Tibet. Later, the Chinese emperor assigned the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama to be in charge of religious and political matters in Tibet. The Dalai Lama was leader of the area around Lhasa; the Panchen Lama was leader of the area of Shigatse Prefecture.

By the early 18th century, the Qing dynasty had started to send resident commissioners (&quot;Ambans&quot;) to Lhasa. Tibetan factions rebelled in 1750 and killed the resident commissioners after the central government decided to reduce the number of soldiers to about 100. The Qing army entered and defeated the rebels and reinstalled the resident commissioner. The number of soldiers in Tibet was kept at about 2,000. The defensive duties were assisted by a local force which was reorganized by the resident commissioner, and the Tibetan government continued to manage day-to-day affairs as before.

At multiple places such as Lhasa, Batang, Dartsendo, Lhari, Chamdo, and Litang, Green Standard Army troops were garrisoned throughout the Dzungar war. Green Standard Army troops and Manchu Bannermen were both part of the Qing force which fought in Tibet in the war against the Dzungars. It was said that the Sichuan commander Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of Yue Fei) entered Lhasa first when the 2,000 Green Standard soldiers and 1,000 Manchu soldiers of the &quot;Sichuan route&quot; seized Lhasa. According to Mark C. Elliott, after 1728 the Qing used Green Standard Army troops to man the garrison in Lhasa rather than Bannermen. According to Evelyn S. Rawski, both Green Standard Army and Bannermen made up the Qing garrison in Tibet. According to Sabine Dabringhaus, Green Standard Chinese soldiers numbering more than 1,300 were stationed by the Qing in Tibet to support the 3,000-strong Tibetan army.

In the mid 19th century, arriving with an Amban, a community of Chinese troops from Sichuan who married Tibetan women settled down in the Lubu neighborhood of Lhasa, where their descendants established a community and assimilated into Tibetan culture. Hebalin was the location of where Chinese Muslim troops and their offspring lived, while Lubu was the place where Han Chinese troops and their offspring lived.

In 1904, the British Empire launched an expedition to Tibet to counter perceived Russian influence in the region. The expedition, which initially set out with the stated goal of resolving border disputes between Tibet and Sikkim, quickly turned into an invasion of Tibet. The forces of the expedition invaded and captured Lhasa, with the 13th Dalai Lama fleeing to the countryside. After the British captured Lhasa, a treaty was signed between the two nations, known as the Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet, which gained for the British great economic influence in the region while ensuring that Tibet remained under Chinese control. Just two years later, however, the British signed a new treaty with the Qing government, known as the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet, which affirmed Chinese control of Tibet. The British agreed not to annex or interfere in Tibet in return for indemnity from the Chinese government, while China engaged &quot;not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet&quot;.

The Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1906 recognized Chinese suzerainty over the region. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, without Lhasa&#x27;s or Beijing&#x27;s acknowledgement, recognized the &quot;suzerainty of China over Tibet&quot;. The Qing central government claimed for sovereignty and direct rule over Tibet in 1910. The 13th Dalai Lama fled to British India in February 1910. In the same month, the Chinese government issued a proclamation &#x27;deposing&#x27; the Dalai Lama and instigating the search for a new incarnation. When he returned from exile, the Dalai Lama declared Tibetan independence (1912).

=== Republic of China ===
The 1911 revolution ended the Qing dynasty, and the claim to Tibet was passed down to the Republic of China in the Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor. However the subsequent outbreak of World War I and civil war in China meant that Chinese factions controlled only parts of Tibet. The government of the 13th Dalai Lama, who declared Tibet&#x27;s independence, controlled Ü-Tsang (Dbus-gtsang) and western Kham, roughly coincident with the borders of the Tibet Autonomous Region today, and was recognized by the Bogd Khanate in outer Mongolia but not by other countries. Eastern Kham, separated from it by the Yangtze River, was under the control of Chinese warlord Liu Wenhui. The situation in Amdo (Qinghai) was more complicated, with the Xining area controlled by warlord Ma Bufang (of Hui ethnicity), who constantly strove to exert control over the rest of Amdo (Qinghai). General Ma Fuxiang (also of Hui ethnicity) was the chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and a supporter of Tibet as an integral part of the Republic of China.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

In 1950, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of the People&#x27;s Republic of China invaded Tibet, after taking over the rest of China from the Republic of China during the five years of civil war. In 1951, the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, a treaty signed by representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, established that the region would be ruled by a joint administration under representatives of the central government and the Tibetan government.

The Chinese have claimed that most of the population of Tibet at that time were serfs, bound to land owned by lamas. This claim has been challenged by other researchers (see serfdom in Tibet controversy). Any attempt at land reform or the redistribution of wealth would have proved unpopular with the established landowners. The Seventeen Point Agreement was put into effect only in Tibet proper; ergo, eastern Kham and Amdo, being outside the administration of the government of Tibet, were treated like territory belonging to any other Chinese province, with land reform implemented in full. As a result, a rebellion broke out in these regions in June 1956. The rebellion eventually spread to Lhasa, but was crushed by 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama and other government principals fled to exile in India.

==CIA and MI6 activities in Tibet (1950–1970)==


Agents of Western governments had infiltrated Tibet by the mid-1950s, a few years after Tibet had been annexed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Beginning in the 1950s the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) trained Tibetans as paramilitaries. British MI6 agent Sydney Wignall, in his autobiography, reveals that he and John Harrop travelled to Tibet together in 1955 posing as mountaineers. Captured by the Chinese authority, Wignall recalled that he was surprised to find two CIA agents were already under Chinese detention.

Clandestine military involvement by the U.S. began following the series of uprisings in the eastern Tibetan region of Kham in 1956. Several small groups of Khampa fighters were trained by the CIA camp and then airdropped back into Tibet with supplies. In 1958, with the rebellion in Kham ongoing, two of these fighters, Athar and Lhotse, attempted to meet with the Dalai Lama to determine whether he would cooperate with their activities. However, their request for an audience was refused by the Lord Chamberlain, Phala Thubten Wonden, who believed such a meeting would be impolitic. According to Tsering Shakya, &quot;Phala never told the Dalai Lama or the Kashag of the arrival of Athar and Lhotse. Nor did he inform the Dalai Lama of American willingness to provide aid.&quot;

Following a mass uprising in Lhasa in 1959 during the celebration of the Tibetan New Year and the ensuing Chinese military response, the Dalai Lama went into exile in India.The Dalai Lama&#x27;s escape was assisted by the CIA. After 1959, the CIA trained Tibetan guerrillas and provided funds and weapons for the fight against China. However, assistance was reduced during the course of the 1960s and finally ended when Richard Nixon decided to seek rapprochement with China in the early 1970s. Kenneth Conboy and James Morrison, in &quot;The CIA&#x27;s Secret War in Tibet&quot;, reveal how the CIA encouraged Tibetan revolt against China — and eventually came to control its fledgling resistance movement. 

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 2 October 1998 that the Tibetan exile movement received $1.7 million a year in the 1960s from the CIA. The Dalai Lama said in his autobiography that his brothers were responsible and that they didn&#x27;t tell him about it, knowing what his reaction would be. Lodi Gyari, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s personal representative in Washington, said he had no knowledge of the annual subsidy of $180,000 marked as for the Dalai Lama or how it was spent. The government in exile say they knew that the CIA trained and equipped Tibetan guerrillas who raided Tibet from a base camp in Nepal, and that the effect of those operations &quot;only resulted in more suffering for the people of Tibet. Worse, these activities gave the Chinese government the opportunity to blame the efforts of those seeking to regain Tibetan independence on the activities of foreign powers—whereas, of course, it was an entirely Tibetan initiative.&quot; The budget figures for the CIA&#x27;s Tibetan program were as follows:

* Subsidy to the Dalai Lama: US$180,000 
* Support of 2,100 Tibetan guerrillas based in Nepal: US$500,000
* Other costs: US$1.06m
* Total: US$1.73m

== Positions on the status of Tibet ==
The status of Tibet before 1951, especially in the period between 1912 and 1951, is largely in dispute between supporters and opponents of Tibetan independence.

According to supporters of Tibetan independence, Tibet was a distinct nation and state independent between the fall of the Mongol Empire in 1368 and subjugation by the Qing Dynasty in 1720; and again between the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912 and its incorporation into the PRC in 1951. Moreover, even during the periods of nominal subjugation to the Yuan and Qing, Tibet was largely self-governing. As such, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) views current PRC rule in Tibet as illegitimate, motivated solely by the natural resources and strategic value of Tibet, and in violation of both Tibet&#x27;s historical status as an independent country and the right of the Tibetan people to self-determination. It also points to PRC&#x27;s autocratic and divide-and-rule policies, and assimilationist policies, regarding those as an example of imperialism bent on destroying Tibet&#x27;s distinct ethnic makeup, culture, and identity, thereby cementing it as an indivisible part of China. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, both Mongolia and Tibet declared independence and recognized each other as such.

On the other hand, opponents assert that the PRC rules Tibet legitimately, by saying that Tibet has been part of Chinese history since the 7th century as the Tibetan Empire had close interactions with the Chinese dynasties through royal marriage. In addition to the &quot;de facto&quot; power that the Chinese has since then, Yuan Dynasty conquest in the 13th century and that all subsequent Chinese governments (Ming Dynasty, Qing Dynasty, Republic of China, and People&#x27;s Republic of China) have been exercising de jure sovereignty power over Tibet.

In addition, as this position argues that no country gave Tibet diplomatic recognition between 1912 and 1951 (except Outer Mongolia), they say that China, under the Republic of China government, continued to maintain sovereignty over the region, and the leaders of Tibet themselves acknowledged Chinese sovereignty by sending delegates to the following: the Drafting Committee for a new constitution of the Republic of China in 1925, the National Assembly of the Republic of China in 1931, the fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang in 1931, the , which drafted a new Chinese constitution in 1946, and finally to another National Assembly for drafting a new Chinese constitution in 1948. Finally, some within the PRC considers all movements aimed at ending Chinese sovereignty in Tibet, starting with the expedition of 1904, to the CTA today, as one interconnected campaign abetted by malicious Western powers aimed at destroying Chinese integrity and sovereignty, thereby weakening China&#x27;s position in the world. The PRC also points to what it calls the autocratic and theocratic policies of the government of Tibet before 1959, as well as its renunciation of South Tibet, claimed by China as a part of historical Tibet occupied by India, as well as the Dalai Lama&#x27;s association with India, and as such claims the CTA has no moral legitimacy to govern Tibet.

== Positions on Tibet after 1950 ==
Tibetan exiles generally say that the number that have died in the Great Leap Forward, violence, or other unnatural causes since 1950 is approximately 1.2 million. However, this number is controversial. According to Patrick French, a supporter of the Tibetan cause who was able to view the data and calculations, the estimate is not reliable because the Tibetans were not able to process the data well enough to produce a credible total, with many persons double or triple counted. There were, however, many casualties, perhaps as many as 400,000. This figure is extrapolated from a calculation Warren W. Smith made from census reports of Tibet which show 200,000 &quot;missing&quot; from Tibet. Even anti-Communist resources such as &quot;the Black Book of Communism&quot; expresses doubt at the 1.2 million figure, but does note that according to the Chinese census, the total population of ethnic Tibetans in the PRC was 2.8 million in 1953, but only 2.5 million in 1964. It puts forward a figure of 800,000 deaths and alleges that as many as 10% of Tibetans were interned, with few survivors. Chinese demographers have estimated that 90,000 of the 300,000 &quot;missing&quot; Tibetans fled the region.

The Central Tibetan Administration also says that millions of Chinese immigrants to the TAR are diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage. Exile groups say that despite recent attempts to restore the appearance of original Tibetan culture to attract tourism, the traditional Tibetan way of life is now irrevocably changed. It is also reported that when Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, visited Lhasa in 1980, he was unhappy when he found out the region was behind neighbouring provinces. Reforms were instituted, and since then the central government&#x27;s policy in Tibet has granted most religious freedoms, but monks and nuns were sometimes imprisoned, and many Tibetans (mostly monks and nuns) fled Tibet yearly.

The government of the PRC claims that the population of Tibet in 1737 was about 8 million. It claims that due to the &#x27;backward&#x27; rule of the local theocracy, there was rapid decrease in the next two hundred years and the population in 1959 was only about one million. Today, the population of Greater Tibet is 7.3 million, of which 5 million is ethnic Tibetan, according to the 2000 census. According to the PRC the increase is viewed as the result of the abolishment of the theocracy and introduction of a modern, higher standard of living. Based on the census numbers, the PRC also rejects claims that the Tibetans are being swamped by Han Chinese; instead the PRC says that the border for Greater Tibet drawn by the government of Tibet in Exile is so large that it incorporates regions such as Xining that are not traditionally Tibetan in the first place, hence exaggerating the number of non-Tibetans. 

The government of the PRC also rejects claims that the lives of Tibetans have deteriorated, pointing to rights enjoyed by the Tibetan language in education and in courts and says that the lives of Tibetans have been improved immensely compared to the Dalai Lama&#x27;s rule before 1950. Benefits that are commonly quoted include: the GDP of Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) today is 30 times that before 1950; it has 22,500 km of highways, all built since 1950; all secular education in the region was created after integration into the PRC; there are 25 scientific research institutes, all built by the PRC; infant mortality has dropped from 43% in 1950 to 0.661% in 2000; life expectancy has risen from 35.5 years in 1950 to 67 in 2000; the collection and publishing of the traditional &quot;Epic of King Gesar&quot;, which is the longest epic poem in the world and had only been handed down orally before; allocation of 300 million Renminbi since the 1980s to the maintenance and protection of Tibetan monasteries.

== Supporting organisations ==
Organisations which support the Tibetan independence movement include:

* Tibetan Youth Congress – Located at Dharamsala, the seat of the Government of Tibet in Exile in India, claims 30,000 members.
* International Tibet Independence Movement – Located in Indiana, United States. It was formed in March 1995 and is now a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization for informing about Tibetan independence.
* International Tibetan Aid Organization – Located in Amsterdam, Netherlands, this organization was formed in 2004.

However, Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, is no longer calling for independence. He has spoken in many international venues, including the United States Congress, and the European Parliament. In 1987, he has also started campaigning for a peaceful resolution to the issue of the status of Tibet, and has since then advocated that Tibet should not become independent, but that it should be given meaningful autonomy within the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This approach is known as the &quot;Middle Way&quot;. In November 2017, he stated that &quot;the past was the past&quot;, and that he believed that China after opening up its economy, has changed 40 to 50 percent of what it was earlier. He claimed that Tibetans didn&#x27;t want independence and instead wanted to stay and have more economic development from China. In October 2020, he stated that he did not support Tibetan independence and hoped to visit China as a Nobel Prize winner. He said, &quot;I prefer the concept of a &#x27;republic&#x27; in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In the concept of republic, ethnic minorities are like Tibetans, the Mongols, Manchus, and Xinjiang Uyghurs, we can live in harmony&quot;.

Some organisations either support the &quot;Middle Way&quot; or do not adopt a definitive stance on whether they support independence or greater autonomy. Such organisations include:
* Free Tibet Campaign – Located in London, United Kingdom, formed in 1987, stands for the right of Tibetans to determine their own future and for the future of their own country.
* International Tibet Support Network – Located in London, United Kingdom, established in 2000, umbrella organization for Tibet related organization worldwide.
* Shiv Ganga Vidya Mandir, Phaphamau, Allahabad organized a Tibet Freedom Solidarity Rally in Allahabad on 9 April 2016, drawing more than 3000 participants.

== Celebrity support, Freedom Concerts and public awareness==

The Tibetan independence movement became cause-célèbre in the US and Europe as the words &quot;Free Tibet&quot; and the Tibetan flag gained worldwide fame in the press and public consciousness starting from 1987. The movement gained strength and popular support in the west from 1987 to 2008, until the 2008 Tibetan unrest. The initial spark for the awareness of &quot;Free Tibet&quot; and the Tibetan flag was probably street demonstrations, perhaps specifically the 1986 Ottawa demonstration in Canada.

Eventually, The flag of Tibet and words were printed globally on t-shirts, cushions, mugs, bookmarks, badges, bracelets, bags and other merchandise, and almost all Westerners became aware of the cause of Tibetan independence.

The &quot;Free Tibet&quot; movement is supported by some celebrities, such as Richard Gere and Paris Hilton.

British comedian Russell Brand also occasionally mentions his support for the movement on his BBC Radio 2 show. Richard Gere is one of the most outspoken supporters of the movement and is chairman of the board of directors for the International Campaign for Tibet. Actress Sharon Stone caused significant controversy when she suggested that the 2008 Sichuan earthquake may have been the result of &quot;bad karma,&quot; because the Chinese &quot;are not being nice to the Dalai Lama, who is a good friend of mine.&quot; The Dalai Lama confirmed that he did not share Stone&#x27;s views, although he confirmed that he had &quot;met the lady&quot;.

U.S. actor and martial artist Steven Seagal has been an active supporter of Tibetan independence for several decades and makes regular donations to various Tibetan charities around the world. He has been recognized by Tibetan Lama Penor Rinpoche as the reincarnation of tulku Chungdrag Dorje, the treasure revealer of Palyul Monastery. He also claims to have the special ability of clairvoyance; in a November 2006 interview, he stated: &quot;I was born very different, clairvoyant and a healer&quot;.

The Milarepa Fund is an organisation which organises concerts to give publicity to the Tibetan independence movement. The fund was named after Milarepa, the revered 11th-century Tibetan yogi, who used music to enlighten people. It was originally established to disburse royalties from the Beastie Boys album &quot;Ill Communication&quot; in 1994, to benefit Tibetan monks who were sampled on two songs. The Milarepa Fund organizers also jointed the Beastie Boys as they headlined the 1994 Lollapalooza Tour. Inspired by this tour, they began to organise a concert to promote Tibetan independence, in the style of Live Aid.

Organized in June 1996, the first concert (in San Francisco) opened with Icelandic singer Björk and featured acts such as Radiohead, The Smashing Pumpkins, Cibo Matto, Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and De La Soul. The concerts continued for three more years, which helped to generate publicity for the Tibetan independence movement. It also reportedly led to the growth of Tibetan independence organisations such as Students for a Free Tibet and Free Tibet Campaign worldwide.

Gorillaz, the virtual band have shown support through a TV spot showing animated frontman, 2D, meditating with fellow supporters outside of the Chinese embassy, followed by a brief message encouraging people to join the Free Tibet Campaign. In addition, during the holographic performances of &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, 2D is wearing a shirt saying &quot;FREE TIBET.&quot;

During the 2008 Liège–Bastogne–Liège cycling race Australian rider Cadel Evans wore an undershirt with &#x27;Free Tibet&#x27; printed on it, bringing attention to the movement months before the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing.

In 2011, an Indian movie &quot;Rockstar&quot; depicted poster of &#x27;Free Tibet&#x27; slogan in Sadda Haq song. People waving the Free Tibet flag in the backdrop was shown in the song video. This triggered a dispute between Central Board of Film Certification and movie director Imtiaz Ali when the Board ordered Ali to blur the flag and Free Tibet slogan before the film hit the theatre, but the director refused to do it. However, Ali had to remove the sequence from the video to get the film&#x27;s censor done. Deletion of the Tibetan flag from the video caused wide protests in Tibet, Dharamsala and Chennai.

<text>In sports, a farm team (also referred to as farm system, developmental system, feeder team, or nursery club) is generally a team or club whose role is to provide experience and training for young players, with an agreement that any successful players can move on to a higher level at a given point, usually in an association with a major-level parent team. This system can be implemented in many ways, both formally and informally. It is not to be confused with a practice squad, which fulfills a similar developmental purpose but the players on the practice squad are members of the parent team.

==Contracted farm teams==
===Baseball===
In the United States and Canada, Minor League Baseball teams operate under strict franchise contracts with their major league counterparts. Although the vast majority of such teams are privately owned and are therefore able to switch affiliation, those players under contract with the affiliated Major League Baseball team are under their exclusive control, and would move to the MLB club&#x27;s new affiliate. Not all players on a minor league team are under contract with the MLB club; however, the parent club has the exclusive right to &quot;purchase&quot; the contract of a non-contract player at its affiliate.

Minor league teams are usually based in smaller cities (although the New York Mets have a low-level minor-league affiliate actually based elsewhere within New York City), and players who are contracted to them, as opposed to major league players sent down to this level for rehabilitation or other professional-development assignments, are typically paid significantly less than their Major League counterparts.

Most major league players start off their careers by working their way up the minor league system, from the lowest (rookie) to the highest (AAA) classification, with the rare exceptions usually being those players signed from Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball. Since the elimination of the bonus rule, only a very small number of amateur players have gone directly into MLB, including John Olerud, Jim Abbott, and Dave Winfield. The process of a player working his way up through the minor leagues is formally referred by most MLB teams as &quot;player development&quot;. However, minor league affiliates are often informally referred to as &quot;farm teams&quot; and a major league player&#x27;s misfortune of being sent back to the minors is sometimes described as being &quot;farmed out&quot;.

The farm system as it is recognized today was invented by Branch Rickey, who – as field manager, general manager, and club president – helped to build the St. Louis Cardinals dynasty during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. When Rickey joined the team in 1917, players were commonly purchased by major league teams from independent, high-level minor league clubs.

Rickey, a keen judge of talent, became frustrated when players at the A and AA levels he had agreed to purchase were instead offered for bid and sold by those independent clubs to wealthier rivals. With the support of Cardinal owner Sam Breadon, Rickey devised a plan whereby St. Louis would buy and control its own minor league teams from Class D to Class AA (the highest level at the time), thus allowing them to promote or demote players as they developed, and &quot;grow&quot; their own talent.

The talent pipeline began at tryout camps that St. Louis scouts conducted throughout the U.S. &quot;From quantity comes quality,&quot; Rickey once observed, and, during the 1930s, with as many as 40 owned or affiliated farm teams, the Cardinals controlled the destinies of hundreds of players each year. (The reserve clause then bound players to their teams in perpetuity.)

The Cardinals won nine National League pennants and six World Series championships between 1926 and 1946, proving the effectiveness of the farm system concept. Indeed, the second club to fully embrace such a system, the New York Yankees, used it to sustain their dynasty from the mid-1930s through the middle of the 1960s. When Rickey moved to the Brooklyn Dodgers as president and general manager in 1943, he built a hugely successful farm system there as well after the end of World War II. The teams that ignored the farm system in the 1930s and early 1940s (such as the Philadelphia A&#x27;s and Phillies and the Washington Senators) found themselves falling on hard times.

The existence of the minor league system is due in part to MLB&#x27;s ability to include a reserve clause in its contracts with minor league players, which gives the major league team exclusive rights to a player even after the contract has expired. In a landmark 1922 Supreme Court decision, &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot;, baseball was granted a special immunity from antitrust laws. Despite the advent of free agency in 1976, which led many to predict the demise of the farm system, it still remains a strong component of a winning baseball strategy. Under the current minor league system (since the last reorganization in 2021), each of the thirty major league teams has four affiliated minor league teams.

===Ice hockey===

The teams of the National Hockey League also have their own farm teams in the American Hockey League (AHL). For example, the Cleveland Monsters are the farm team for the Columbus Blue Jackets. Additionally, NHL teams have affiliates in the ECHL, although the terms of the most recent CBA (expired in 2012) prohibited ECHL players from being recalled to the NHL or being sent down to that league without being assigned to the AHL first; thus, ECHL teams are &quot;de facto&quot; affiliated to their respective NHL-partner&#x27;s farm team in the AHL. Although some NHL franchises own their AHL and/or ECHL affiliates, many AHL and ECHL franchises are independently owned, with ties to NHL franchises made through affiliation contracts.

Unlike baseball, not all the players on the rosters of the minor league teams are owned by an NHL team. The AHL system recognizes two types of contracts: the two-way contract (generally the most common among NHL prospects), in which players can be sent back and forth between the NHL and AHL at will, and the standard contract, which binds the player to the AHL. The NHL teams have negotiating rights to AHL players on their farm clubs&#x27; rosters and can upgrade a player to a two-way contract if they so desire. Players can also be sent down to the AHL via the waivers system; if a player is not claimed by any team when placed on waivers, he is by default assigned to his previous team&#x27;s AHL club.

==Association football==

===Internal feeder teams===
In many clubs, there will be internal feeder teams. These may be age-restricted teams, such as an &quot;Under-18s&quot; team, or an &quot;A team&quot;. For example, in international association football, national teams also operate youth sides—see England national under-21 football team, for example.

In the United States, some Major League Soccer teams previously had reserve teams in the MLS Reserve League. Later, all teams were nominally required to field a reserve team or an affiliate in a professional league operated by the United Soccer League—either the USL Championship, which occupies the second tier of the United States soccer league system, or USL League One, one of two leagues that then shared third-tier status. This requirement was never strictly enforced. In 2022, MLS will relaunch its reserve league as MLS Next Pro, which occupies the third level alongside USL League One and the National Independent Soccer Association. The first Next Pro season will feature 21 teams, all but one of which are MLS reserve sides, with most having been withdrawn from the USL system in advance of the establishment of the new league. All remaining MLS reserve sides will be withdrawn from the USL system after the 2022 season to join Next Pro.

In many sports, these feeder teams will compete in their own leagues, though in some cases they compete with other &quot;full teams&quot; at a lower level.

In some countries, such as New Zealand, major teams are organised as regional franchises, and local club sides within these regions become automatic feeder clubs for these regional teams.

===Domestic and cross-border agreements===

It is also becoming more common for football clubs to arrange formal deals with other clubs with which they originally had no connection. The feeder/parent club connection could have many functions, and be very beneficial both for the feeder and the parent club. For bigger clubs, it is common to arrange agreements with the minor clubs in the area. The smaller teams can provide the bigger team (the parent club) with young talents, and the mother club have an opportunity to send their young players away on loan to these teams (&quot;to farm out&quot;).

In addition to local connection, it is increasingly commonplace for teams to have feeder clubs in other regions of the country or in other nations, in order to gain further knowledge. Prominent European clubs are often making intercontinental deals with other clubs for the same reason. AFC Ajax have for instance a connection with the South African team Ajax Cape Town, Manchester United have a connection with the Australian team Wollongong Wolves and the Belgian team Royal Antwerp, and Lithuanian side FBK Kaunas have loaned many of their younger players out to their Scottish parent team Heart of Midlothian in the hope of securing them a deal at a bigger club in the future. Having a feeder club in wealthy countries, where football is gaining a gradually better reputation, has also proved to be very beneficial. Countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, China and South Korea are good examples. Alternatively, some clubs within the European Union have used feeder teams to sign non-EU players and then naturalize them in an EU country, to overcome visa regulations, for example English team Liverpool F.C. has an agreement with Belgian side KRC Genk.

==League-owned farm leagues==
===American football===
The National Football League is the only one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America that does not currently have a farm system, although the 2024 incarnation of the United Football League is making strides to fill the niche of a minor league. Many players from the UFL have made the jump from UFL to the NFL, including A.J. McCarron, Ben DiNucci and Hakeem Butler have made the leap from the UFL&#x27;s predecessors XFL and the USFL. Save for a few UFL players, nearly all of the NFL&#x27;s players are drafted from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which operates on a scholarship system which prohibits the payment of cash, but since 2021 also with the Name, Image, &amp; Likeness (NIL) system following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;NCAA v. Alston&quot;, students are now allowed to profit off of their own name, image, and likeness. The scholarship system provides student-athletes with free college education, room and board for up to five years. The relation between college football and the NFL is a result of the development of the game of American football, which (unlike other sports, which were primarily independent club activities) was cultivated at colleges and universities. As a result, players entering the professional football system are generally several years older and more physically mature than first-time professional athletes in other sports, thus reducing the need for a farm system.

In the 1930s, the Chicago Bears and New York Giants owned teams in the American Association, which became the first true minor league in professional football, and later attempted to organize development or farm system with the formation of the Association of Professional Football Leagues, but the agreement lasted less than two years, and was terminated in 1947.
In the 1960s and 1970s, several NFL teams had independent agreements with other leagues such as the Atlantic Coast Football League, Midwest Football League, North Pacific Football League, Professional Football League of America and Midwest Professional Football League, to use their teams as farm teams, though they were not owned by the NFL owners, but all of those arrangements ended after the 1972 season. The most recent official minor league, NFL Europe, was different from most other farm teams in that all prospects were pooled and dispersed among the six European teams, instead of having teams assigned to each other.

Many players in the Arena Football League (among other indoor American football leagues) later advance to the NFL - with more than 100 players which played in both leagues, but no farming contracts exist among any teams, in part because the National Football League Players Association opposes the idea of an affiliated farm system on the grounds that its players would be at risk of unnecessary injury. During the mid-2000s, several NFL owners at least partially owned arena football teams, such as Jerry Jones (Dallas), Arthur Blank (Atlanta), Bud Adams (Tennessee), Tom Benson (New Orleans), and Pat Bowlen (Denver), but very rarely did they ever promote or demote any players between the AFL and NFL, due in part to significant differences in the playing schedules and the style of play between outdoor and indoor football. On February 8, 1999, the NFL also purchased, but never exercised, an option to buy a major interest in the AFL. All of the NFL owners backed out of the league when it went bankrupt, was sold off and reorganized. The Arena Football League had its own developmental league known as the af2 from 2000 to 2009.

In the 2020 incarnation of the XFL, the league established a hybrid between a practice squad and a farm team, what it dubbed &quot;Team 9&quot; operated with the same autonomy as the other eight teams, with its own roster and coaching staff, Team 9 will not play any on-the-record games and will serve as a pool of potential players for the other eight teams to call up in the event of injury. A similar system was used by NFL Europe. In the 2023 incarnation they signed a player personnel partnership with the Indoor Football League (IFL), with the IFL functioning as the XFL&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; minor league.

In Canada, intercollegiate sport has never attained a similar level of following compared to the United States, mainly due to ice hockey being the most popular sport in the country. In hockey, the National Hockey League has historically overlooked intercollegiate sport in favour of other player development models. Nevertheless, the Canadian Football League has established itself as a niche league despite collecting only a fraction of the revenues commanded by the NFL. To recruit talented players, the league to a large extent relies on maintaining rules that are similar enough to American football so as to allow talented NCAA-trained players a reasonable prospect of adapting and being successful in the CFL, while retaining significant enough differences so as to ensure that the league is largely not in competition with the NFL for exactly the same type of players. In addition, to maintain the league&#x27;s distinct Canadian identity, the league enforces a strict quota of Canadian players that must be on the rosters of all CFL teams.

===Basketball===
Traditionally, the NBA did not have a formal farm league, though unofficially, the Continental Basketball Association served as an NBA feeder league on and off through its existence. It mainly relies on the elite NCAA to produce NBA players, and thus the latter was often known as the &quot;feeders&quot;. Since 2001, the NBA directly owns an entire farm league: the NBA G League (formerly the NBA D-League). The NBA G League started with eight teams in the fall of 2001. In March 2005, NBA commissioner David Stern announced a plan to expand the league to fifteen teams and develop it into a true minor league farm system, with each team affiliated with one or more NBA teams. Although the system has been run for a few years, most of the rookies in the NBA are still drafted out from NCAA. At the conclusion of the 2008–09 NBA season, 20 percent of NBA players had spent time in the NBA D-League. By the end of the 2016–17 season, 44% of players in the 2017 NBA playoffs had some experience in the D-League. The league signed a branding agreement with Gatorade in 2017 to become the NBA G League.

==Independent teams==
Some sports allow the operation of independent feeder teams. In professional cycling, for example, feeder teams such as Vendée U and Trek Livestrong, act as feeders for Bouygues Télécom and Team RadioShack respectively, and compete at levels below the UCI ProTour. Most pro-cycling teams use this format.

Such agreements may be less formal; in English football, for example, the operation of an external feeder team is prohibited. However, casual relationships may exist between teams to allow a sharing of larger clubs&#x27; resources with smaller clubs, in return for the smaller teams taking young players on loan. This allows both clubs to maintain separate identities, and to exit from the arrangement if necessary. Such an agreement exists between Preston North End and Holker Old Boys, for example . Alternatively, clubs may use teams playing abroad, particularly if they want to follow the progress of players who they cannot sign due to work permit regulations. Please see List of feeder teams in football for a comprehensive list.

In North American baseball, several independent leagues exist outside of the control of Minor League Baseball or Major League Baseball and without any formal developmental agreements, but may still exist as informal places for talent to develop.

==Professional wrestling==
Professional wrestling utilizes a farm system that allows inexperienced wrestlers to develop their skills and gain in ring experience in smaller, often regional promotions before they are called up to compete in front of a global/national audience. These are generally called &quot;farm leagues&quot; or &quot;developmental territories&quot;.

Some of the more notable ones for WWE include World Wrestling Alliance (1998); Power Pro Wrestling (1998–2000); International Wrestling Association (1999–2001); Memphis Championship Wrestling (2000–2001); Deep South Wrestling (2005–2007); Heartland Wrestling Association (2001–2003), which was also a developmental territory for World Championship Wrestling; Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2008 for WWE; 2011–2013 and 2019–present for Impact Wrestling); and Florida Championship Wrestling (2007–2012).

In 2012, WWE would relaunch and repurpose &quot;NXT—&quot;a reality competition series featuring FCW talent being mentored by WWE &quot;pros&quot;—as an in-house developmental brand, with its weekly television program switching to a more traditional format, and the brand also hosting various live events, and also spawning a UK branch. During this period, NXT received critical acclaim for the quality of its matches and storylines, to the point that WWE began to promote it as a &quot;de facto&quot; third flagship brand, and moved its television series from the streaming WWE Network to USA Network to counterprogram the upstart All Elite Wrestling. However, in 2021, WWE moved &quot;NXT&quot; back to a different night, and later re-launched the series and brand to return to a development-oriented positioning.

==Formula One==
Formula One teams often use the most promising drivers from divisions such as the current Formula Two championship, the former GP2 and Formula Two championships, with the majority of the current Formula Two&#x27;s champions graduating to F1. Ten drivers on the grid for 2011 had previously raced in GP2. 

Racing Bulls (also VCARB; formerly Scuderia Toro Rosso, then Scuderia AlphaTauri) also serves as a sort of farm team for Red Bull Racing. Both are owned by Austrian beverage company Red Bull, with VCARB helping to develop cars and drivers for Red Bull Racing. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel drove for Toro Rosso from 2007 to 2008 before moving to Red Bull in 2009, replacing the retiring David Coulthard. Since the 2014 season, every Red Bull driver had previously been on the RB team, with the exception of Sergio Pérez.

==NASCAR==
NASCAR, the principal body for stock car racing in North America, has an extensive system of developmental series, with the ultimate goal for drivers being a ride in the top-level NASCAR Cup Series. Most Cup Series teams are involved in at least one of NASCAR&#x27;s two other national series, either running vehicles in the junior series or affiliating with teams that run exclusively in those series:

* The second-level Xfinity Series is the main proving ground for potential Cup drivers, crew chiefs, engineers, and pit crew members. Most races are run on the same weekends, and at the same tracks, as Cup Series races, and Xfinity cars are largely similar to Cup cars (though with some differences, most notably less powerful engines).
* The third-level Craftsman Truck Series is a pickup truck-based series. Most races are held in conjunction with Xfinity Series races, with many also serving as support events for Cup Series races. Relatively few drivers or engineers jump directly from the Truck Series to the Cup Series; most spend at least some time in the Xfinity Series first.

Below the three national series are multiple regional series. Cup Series teams generally do not participate at these levels, but extensively scout them for future talent.
* The ARCA Menards Series is a semi-professional stock car series run by the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA), which was acquired by NASCAR in 2018. The series runs on a variety of tracks, including tracks that host events in NASCAR&#x27;s three national series. Even prior to the acquisition, the ARCA Racing Series has had a long-standing relationship with NASCAR as a farm system; its vehicles are based on previous-generation Cup cars, with teams often purchasing chassis and engines that had previously been used by Cup Series teams. The series continued to use the previous &quot;Generation 4&quot; chassis used by the Cup Series until 2016, when the series began to phase in a new composite body based on NASCAR&#x27;s now-former Generation 6 chassis.
* The ARCA Menards Series East and ARCA Menards Series West, which use stock cars with full fenders similar to those in the Cup and Xfinity Series. The series was previously operated under the NASCAR banner until 2020, when it was moved under ARCA.
* The Whelen Modified Tour, operating mostly in the Northeast U.S., races open-wheeled cars with bodies similar to those of other NASCAR cars.
* The NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series in Canada and NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series in Mexico are national series in the respective countries, also using stock cars with full fenders. A few drivers from the Pinty&#x27;s Series have moved to one of the U.S. national series.
The entry level of NASCAR-sanctioned racing is the Whelen All-American Series, a championship for drivers who compete in weekly races at small tracks, often dirt tracks, throughout the U.S. and Canada. Regional champions and an overall series champion are crowned.

==Indoor soccer==
The Premier Arena Soccer League is a farm system for the Major Arena Soccer League.

<text>Gakushū juku (; see cram school) are private, fee-paying schools that offer supplementary classes often in preparation for key school and university entrance exams. The term is primarily used to characterize such schools in Japan. Juku typically operate after regular school hours, on weekends, and during school vacations.

==History==
Juku attendance rose from the 1970s through the mid-1980s; participation rates increased at every grade level throughout the compulsory education years. This phenomenon was a source of great concern to the Ministry of Education, which issued directives to the regular schools that it hoped would reduce the need for after-school lessons, but these directives had little practical effect. Some juku have branches in the United States and other countries to help children living abroad catch up with students in Japan.

While new media have been introduced into juku as instructional and delivery methods, traditional teaching is increasingly shifting to individual tutoring. This shift is partly a response by the supplementary education industry to declining numbers of children in Japan and the threat this decline poses to their industry.

==Structure and curriculum==

There are two types of juku, academic and nonacademic.

===Academic juku===

Academic juku can be roughly divided into categories.

* Locally based middle- or small-sized cram schools
* Schools for salvaging dropouts or children who avoid regular school (free schools, etc.)
* Franchising cram schools
* Other miscellaneous types of cram schools

As of 2011, almost one in five children in their first year of primary school attended after-class instruction, rising to nearly all university-bound high schoolers. The fees are around ¥260,000 ($3,300) annually.

Academic juku offer instruction in the five required subjects: mathematics, Japanese language, science, English, and social studies. They are best known and most widely publicized for their role as &quot;cram schools&quot;, where children (sent by concerned parents) can study to improve scores on upper-secondary school entrance examinations. However, as seen above, there are also juku that provide supplementary education, whether remedial courses to help children falling behind in their studies, refresher courses to explain material in further detail, or courses that cover material on a higher level and thus appeal to children bored by the standardized class structure.

===Nonacademic juku===

Many other children, particularly younger children, attend nonacademic juku for piano lessons, English conversation, art instruction, Japanese calligraphy (shodō), swimming, and abacus (soroban) lessons.

==Social influence==

Juku also play a social role, and children in Japan say they like going to juku because they are able to make new friends. Many children ask to be sent because their friends attend. Some children seem to like juku because of the closer personal contact they have with their teachers and, for students in crowded spaces like Tokyo in particular, the relief jukus can provide from small homes, family, television, Internet, and other distractions.

To some observers, juku represent an attempt by parents to exercise a meaningful measure of choice in Japanese education, particularly for children attending public schools.

==Controversy==

===Criticism===

Because of the commercial nature of most juku, some critics argue that they have profit rather than education at heart. Shares in five juku chains are traded publicly, and 25 others were as of 1992 ready to issue stock as well.

Not all students can afford to attend juku, but school and university test scores rise in direct proportion to spending on juku. The average fee is $160 a month for elementary school and $175 a month for junior high school, but the best ones are several times that amount. Japan spent $10.9 billion on tutoring and cram schools in 1991 alone, including $9 billion on juku for students in the ninth grade or below &quot;almost double the figure spent [in 1985].&quot; With poor students therefore at risk of falling behind, the social and economic inequality in what had been a relatively egalitarian approach to education, at least in public schools through ninth grade, is why Japan&#x27;s powerful teachers&#x27; union does not support the juku institution.

In response to these accusations,

&quot;juku teachers and administrators say that since their schools are profit-making enterprises, they have to guarantee results to succeed. The results are easy to measure since they depend on how many graduates pass the examinations for private school. The profit motive, in other words, provides an incentive to create an atmosphere in which students want to learn.&quot;
&quot;The rise of juku is praised as a secret of Japanese success, a healthy reflection of a system of advancement based on merit. It is also criticized as forcing a new generation to surrender its childhood out of an obsession with status and getting ahead. &#x27;Juku are harmful to Japanese education and to children,&#x27; said Ikuo Amano, professor of sociology at the University of Tokyo. &#x27;It&#x27;s not healthy for kids to have so little free time. It is not healthy to become completely caught up in competition and status at such a young age.&#x27;&quot;

For some, &quot;the schools are also seen as reinforcing a tradition of rote learning over ingenuity.&quot;

===Merits===

In many ways, juku compensate for the formal education system&#x27;s inability or unwillingness to address particular individual problems. &quot;In a 2008 government survey, two-thirds of parents attributed the growing role of juku to shortcomings in public education,&quot; such as the abolition of Saturday schooling (which therefore reduces the number of hours available to cover course material) and the reduction of curricular content (see Yutori education).

Juku offer a more personalized service &quot;and many encourage individual inquisitiveness when the public system treats everyone alike. &#x27;The juku are succeeding in ways that the schools are not,&#x27; an OECD report says.&quot;

<doc id="819528" wikidata="Q4731893" url="?curid=819528" title="Allen Swift">
<text>Ira J. Stadlen (January 16, 1924 – April 18, 2010), known professionally as Allen Swift, was an American actor, writer and magician, best known as a voiceover artist who voiced cartoon characters Simon Bar Sinister and Riff-Raff on the &quot;Underdog&quot; cartoon show. He took his professional name from radio comedian Fred Allen and 18th century satirist Jonathan Swift.

==Early life and education==
He was born January 16, 1924, in Washington Heights, Manhattan, and raised in Brooklyn. Swift graduated from the High School of Music &amp; Art, after which he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces, where he served from November 1942 to November 1945. While in the Army, he was an entertainer and became a private first class.

==Career==
===Children&#x27;s television===
Allen Swift was an early television star who began his career by replacing Buffalo Bob Smith on &quot;The Howdy Doody Show&quot; while Smith was recovering from a heart attack. At various times, he played the characters of Clarabell the Clown, Chief Thunderchicken, and the voice of the Howdy Doody puppet, as well as other characters. From September 10, 1956, to September 23, 1960, Swift was the host of another popular children&#x27;s show, &quot;The Popeye Show&quot;, on WPIX in New York City, playing a sea captain named &quot;Captain Allen Swift&quot;. In the show, he commented on the cartoons, told stories, sang sea shanties and did magic tricks.

===Cartoon voices===
Swift was best known for providing the fiendish voices for the cartoon villains Simon Bar Sinister and Riff-Raff on the &quot;Underdog&quot; cartoon show, and Popeye in the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons created in the 1960s. He also voiced the cartoon character, Clint Clobber.

Swift voiced the cartoon mascot Twinkie the Kid in animated TV advertisements for Hostess&#x27;s cream-filled snack cakes, Twinkies, in the 1970s. He also voiced many of the characters in the 1960s underwater puppet show &quot;Diver Dan&quot;, and Gene Deitch&#x27;s 1961–1962 group of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons, as well as &quot;The Bluffers&quot;. According to &quot;Mopar&quot; magazine, he was also the voice of &quot;Tech&quot; for their series of service training films, providing color commentary and dry humor to help keep things digestible and interesting. He also voiced his talents for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

===Rankin/Bass===
Swift provided the majority of the voices in Rankin/Bass&#x27;s &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot;, credited as Alan Swift in the movie&#x27;s credits. He was also in other Rankin/Bass productions, including the TV specials, &quot;The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye: The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, as the voice of Musty, and as the voice of Gadzooks the Bear in &quot;The Easter Bunny Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;.

===Howdy Doody===
Swift supplied most of the character voices for the NBC &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show. When Buffalo Bob Smith — who did the voice of the lead puppet character Howdy Doody, and had proclaimed many times that &quot;nobody else could do Howdy&quot; — suffered a heart attack, Swift took home some recordings over the weekend, came back Monday, and supplied Howdy&#x27;s voice for more than a year.

===Writing===
Swift became the second comedy writer for &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; following the abrupt departure of the series&#x27; first comedy writer and songwriter, Edward Kean. He also wrote the play &quot;Checking Out&quot;, which was the basis of the film of the same name starring Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, Judge Reinhold and David Paymer.

Toward the end of his life, Swift penned the memoir, &quot;Chutzpah! Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee, An Actors Life For Me&quot;.

===Commercials and &quot;MAD&quot; Magazine===
Swift provided the original voice of the Frito Bandito in the animated Fritos Corn Chips commercials of the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was the talking drain in Drano television commercials, the voice of the Mirinda Craver in Jim Henson&#x27;s Mirinda commercials, and the voice of The Burger King. Because of his uncanny ability to create so many different sounds, tones and accents, he was able to voice competing products, including Tip-Top, Braun, Stroehmann or Taystee. He impersonated Carroll O&#x27;Connor as Archie Bunker and Adolf Hitler as &quot;Dolf&quot; on &quot;MAD&quot; magazine&#x27;s vinyl insert recording of &quot;Gall in the Family Fare&quot;, the &quot;All in the Family&quot; satire that ran in the magazine&#x27;s Super Special No. 11 in 1973. He also played Captain Cupcake in the Hostess Brands commercials.

==Personal life==

<text>Saleva&#x27;a Fuauli Atisano&#x27;e (born December 31, 1963), better known by his stage name, , is an American-born Japanese former professional sumo wrestler. He was the first non-Japanese-born wrestler to reach &quot;ōzeki&quot;, the second-highest possible rank in the sport. During his career he won the top division championship on three occasions and came very close to becoming the first foreign-born grand champion, or &quot;yokozuna&quot;, prompting a social debate in Japan as to whether a foreigner could have the necessary cultural understanding to be deemed acceptable in sumo&#x27;s ultimate rank. At a peak weight of he was also at the time the heaviest wrestler ever in sumo, earning him the nicknames &quot;Meat Bomb&quot; and, most famously, &quot;The Dump Truck&quot;.

Born in 1963 in Hawai&#x27;i to Vaa Atisanoe and Fala of Tula, American Sāmoa, Yasokichi became the first foreigner to earn the prestigious title of sumo wrestling champion in Japan.

==Early career==
Playing truant from school one day, Yasokichi, already 170kg at the age of 18, was spotted on the beach in Hawaii by a sumo talent scout and was offered the chance to go to Japan to train. He entered sumo in July 1982, recruited by another Hawaiian-born wrestler, Takamiyama of the Takasago stable. A promising student at the University High School in Honolulu, he initially wanted to be a lawyer and was also offered a music scholarship to Syracuse University. His father had regular work with the US Navy but had to support eight children. Yasokichi regarded Takamiyama as a local hero and found the opportunity to travel to Japan too good to resist, although his parents were reluctant for him to do so.

Due to his potential he was given the name Konishiki, after the 17th Yokozuna, Konishiki Yasokichi I (see List of yokozuna) who came from the same training stable at the end of the 19th Century, during the Meiji period in Japan, and , a &quot;komusubi&quot; in the beginning of the 20th century. Yasokichi was the sixth &quot;Konishiki&quot; in history, though he was the third to reach the top division. He rose to the privileged &quot;sekitori&quot; ranks in just eight tournaments, a remarkably rapid rise.

In July 1984, he made his debut in the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division, and in the following tournament in September he defeated two &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Chiyonofuji and Takanosato, and was runner-up with a 12–3 record. He was promoted to &quot;komusubi&quot; for the first time in May 1985 and &quot;sekiwake&quot; in July 1985. However, he suffered an injury to his coccyx, caused by a stool collapsing underneath him, and had to sit out the next tournament. In May 1986, he suffered another injury, this time in competition, during a bout with Futahaguro. Konishiki came back strongly from this setback and three consecutive double figure scores in 1987 earned him promotion to &quot;ōzeki&quot;.
==&quot;Ōzeki&quot;==

Many people expected Konishiki to quickly make his push for &quot;yokozuna&quot; promotion. His stablemaster, the 46th Yokozuna Asashio Tarō III, had predicted Konishiki would reach the top rank by his 25th birthday. However, his increasing weight caused a strain on his knee, exacerbated by previous high-school football injuries, which badly affected his performances. After a string of mediocre 8–7 scores he turned in a disastrous 3–12 in September 1988. 

His problems continued in 1989 and a 5–10 mark in September left him in danger of demotion from &quot;ōzeki&quot; once again. He made a spectacular comeback in November 1989, taking his first tournament championship with a 14–1 record. He was the first foreigner to win a top division title since Takamiyama in 1972. In March 1990 he took part in a three-way playoff for the title but he was outshone by Asahifuji, who earned promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot; in July. In May 1991 Konishiki won 14 consecutive bouts but was beaten in a playoff on the final day by Asahifuji.

===Close to &quot;yokozuna&quot;===

By late 1991 Konishiki was a strong &quot;yokozuna&quot; candidate. He had overcome his injuries and showed much more consistency. &quot;Yokozuna&quot; Chiyonofuji and Ōnokuni had both recently retired, and Asahifuji and Hokutoumi were struggling with illness and injury. Konishiki took advantage by winning two championships (his 2nd and 3rd overall) in November 1991 and March 1992, with a record in the last three tournaments of 38 wins and 7 losses. He was denied promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot;, normally awarded to those with two consecutive tournament wins or an equivalent achievement. Konishiki had three non-consecutive wins.

The chairman of the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee, Hideo Ueda, announced, &quot;We wanted to make doubly sure that Konishiki is worthy to be a grand champion. Therefore, we decided to wait for another tournament.&quot; Another member of the committee, Noboru Kojima, said in an interview in the April issue of &quot;Bungei Shunjū&quot; that Konishiki did not possess &quot;hinkaku&quot; (), a word derived from &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;grace, elegance and refinement&quot;. His remarks were given the headline, &quot;We Don’t Need a Foreign Yokozuna&quot; in the magazine. 

A controversy arose when &quot;The Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; reported that Konishiki in an interview had alleged racial discrimination was the reason for his being denied promotion. &quot;The New York Times&quot; subsequently quoted Konishiki as saying, &quot;If I were Japanese, I would be yokozuna already.&quot; The Japan Sumo Association demanded an apology. Konishiki held a press conference during which he made his apology and tearfully denied making the remarks. He insisted that &quot;The Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; had misinterpreted his remark, and that he had not spoken to The New York Times, and instead a Hawaiian apprentice Koryu had impersonated him on the telephone. 

Despite the denial, the damage had been done. The media furore hampered his preparations for the forthcoming tournament which resulted in a mediocre 9–6 record. Konishiki never came close to promotion again.

==Later career==
Konishiki retained his &quot;ōzeki&quot; ranking for 39 tournaments over more than six years, but he eventually lost it in November 1993 after two consecutive losing records. He continued to compete in the top division as a &quot;maegashira&quot; for another four years. Now weighing over , his knee injury and mobility issues meant he was susceptible to belt throws and slap downs by lighter and more agile opponents. Even though he enjoyed less success, he became progressively more popular with Japanese fans due to his continuous fighting spirit, distinctive bulk and warm, amiable personality.

In November 1997, he faced demotion to the second &quot;jūryō&quot; division and announced his retirement after 15 years in sumo. In addition to his chronic knee problems, he had been suffering from gout and a stomach ulcer. He said that in spite of his setbacks &quot;I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve continued with sumo, because I&#x27;ve learned a lot from sumo, and I&#x27;ve also learned the Japanese language and life style.&quot; He had spent 81 consecutive tournaments in the top division, and won 649 bouts there.

==Fighting style==

Early in his career, under the instruction of his first stablemaster, Konishiki was primarily an &quot;oshi-sumo&quot; specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques such as &quot;oshi-dashi&quot; and &quot;tsuki-dashi&quot; that would win the bout as quickly as possible. Following his knee problems in 1988 and 1989, his balance suffered and as his weight continued to increase he began to change his style, preferring to bide his time by grabbing the opponent&#x27;s &quot;mawashi&quot; and rely on his huge weight advantage to wear them out. By 1992 he was winning virtually all his matches by &quot;yori-kiri&quot; (force out), and his lack of ability to change tack once he had been sidestepped was one of the concerns raised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee when he was up for promotion. His peak weight of recorded in March 1996 was the heaviest ever for a sumo wrestler, until surpassed by Ōrora in 2017.

==Life after sumo==
Konishiki remained in the Japan Sumo Association as an elder for a short time under the name of Sanoyama, before branching out as a Japanese entertainer under the name &quot;KONISHIKI&quot; (the capitalization is an effort to reflect the association&#x27;s requirement to write his name in the Roman alphabet, after prohibition of spelling it out in Japanese characters after his retirement from sumo).

In 2000 Shinichi Watanabe, director of &quot;Excel Saga&quot; and &quot;Puni Puni Poemy&quot;, created an anime series called &quot;Dotto! Koni-chan&quot;, in which Koni, the protagonist, is a fat child who strongly resembles Konishiki.

In January 2004, he married his girlfriend of two years, former medical worker Chie Iijima. He had previously married former model Sumika Shioda in 1992. They divorced amicably in December 2000.

In 2006, he played in the film &quot;Check It Out, Yo&quot; Chekeraccho!! and also made a short appearance in the film &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;.

He is the host of an NHK children&#x27;s program called Nihongo de Asobo (にほんごであそぼ) which teaches children traditional and colloquial Japanese. He is known as &quot;Koni-chan&quot; on the show.

Although he continued to DJ for his FM Yokohama show &quot;Kony Island&quot;, he took a hiatus from Japanese celebrity life for a year in 2007, returning to Hawaii to prepare for gastric bypass surgery. Although he did not have high blood pressure or any heart problems, he had not lost much weight since his retirement, and underwent the operation in February 2008. He announced on his website that the operation went smoothly and that he had since lost . He returned to Japan in May 2008.

After sumo, he began to turn his talents to music, most notably with his collaboration with Rimi Natsukawa as well as L-Burna on the song &quot;Livin Like Kings&quot;. He often sings and raps in a mixture of English and Japanese. He can also play the ukulele. In 2000, he released a hip-hop album called &quot;Kms&quot;, including songs &quot;Island Girl&quot;, &quot;Sumo Stomp&quot;, and the old-school classic &quot;Sumo Gangsta&quot;.

Following the 2011 earthquake, Konishiki was a high-profile fund-raiser for disaster relief in the stricken regions of Japan.

He started the Konishiki Kids Foundation to help underprivileged children from Hawaii to experience Japanese culture.

In June 2022 he celebrated the 40th anniversary of his arrival in Japan with a party attended by chairman of the Japan Sumo Association Hakkaku, former yokozuna Wakanohana III and around 300 others.

At the end of 2024 Konishiki was hospitalized for about a month with obesity-related glomerulopathy. In December of that year he announced that he suffered kidney failure and received a successful organ transplant from his wife, Chie.

==Professional career==

===Draft and Minor Leagues===
He was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the 4th round of the baseball draft and began his professional career by recording a 0–9 record in 13 starts with the Huntington Cubs in the rookie league. He rose through the Cubs farm system with stops in Peoria, Daytona, Orlando and Iowa. His best minor league season was in , when he was the closer for the Orlando team and saved 19 games with a 1.43 ERA.

===Chicago Cubs (1995–1999)===
Adams made his Major League debut on August 10, 1995, for the Cubs against the San Diego Padres in the first game of a doubleheader at Wrigley Field. Adams pitched a scoreless two-thirds of an inning in relief of starting pitcher Frank Castillo. Adams returned to the mound in the second game of the doubleheader, pitching a scoreless eighth inning in relief of starting pitcher Steve Trachsel.

He remained in the Cubs&#x27; bullpen through , primarily as a setup reliever, though he did save 18 games in .

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2000–2001)===
After the 1999 season, the Cubs traded Adams to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with two minor leaguers Chad Ricketts and Brian Stephenson) in return for Eric Young and Ismael Valdes.

He worked out of the bullpen for the Dodgers in , posting a 6–9 record with two saves and a 3.52 ERA in 66 appearances. He was suspended for three games after an altercation with fans on May 25.

It was the first time he had started regularly since pitching with the Single-A Daytona Cubs of the Florida State League. Adams went 12–8 with a 4.33 ERA in 43 games, 22 of which were starts, for the Dodgers that season. Adams was the pitcher to give up Barry Bonds&#x27; 500th home run on April 17, 2001.

<text>Neoclassical ballet is the style of 20th-century classical ballet exemplified by the works of George Balanchine. The term &quot;neoclassical ballet&quot; appears in the 1920s with Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes, in response to the excesses of romanticism and post-romantic modernism. It draws on the advanced technique of 19th-century Russian Imperial dance, but strips it of its detailed narrative and heavy theatrical setting while retaining many key techniques, such as pointe technique.

==History and development==
Neoclassical ballet is a genre of dance that emerged in the 1920s and evolved throughout the 20th century. Artists of many disciplines in the early 1900s began to rebel against the overly dramatized style of the Romantic Period. As a result, art returned to a more simplistic style reminiscent of the Classical Period, except bolder, more assertive and free of distractions. This artistic trend came to be known as Neoclassicism. The ballet choreographer who most exemplified this new, clean aesthetic, was George Balanchine. As a child, the importance of classicism was imprinted on him when he was a student at the famed Imperial Ballet School, which was (and remains) steadfast in its firm commitment to classical ballet technique. Upon his graduation, Balanchine earned the privilege of choreographing for the Ballets Russes, where he had the opportunity to collaborate with Picasso, Matisse, Chanel, Debussy, Stravinsky and Prokofiev, who were all at the forefront of Neoclassicism. Rather than turning away from his classical training, Balanchine built upon the traditional ballet vocabulary. He extended traditional ballet positions, played with speed and freedom of movement, and incorporated new positions not traditionally seen in ballet. Balanchine&#x27;s first foray into the neoclassical style was &quot;Apollon Musegete&quot;, choreographed in 1928 for the Ballets Russes, and set to a score by Stravinsky. Unlike many of his later neoclassical works, this ballet tells a story, which indicates that Balanchine had not yet completely broken free from the Romantic tradition. Moreover, when this ballet first premiered it featured large sets, costumes and props. However, Balanchine continually revised it as his neoclassical style evolved. For example, later versions of the ballet utilized white practice leotards and minimal sets and lights. Balanchine even renamed the ballet simply &quot;Apollo&quot;. The transformation of &quot;Apollo&quot; exemplifies Balanchine’s transformation as a choreographer. As Balanchine’s neoclassical style matured, he produced more plotless, musically driven ballets. Large sets and traditional tutus gave way to clean stages and plain leotards. This simplified external style allowed for the dancers’ movement to become the main artistic medium, which is the hallmark of neoclassical ballet. 

Balanchine found a home for his neoclassical style in the United States, when Lincoln Kirstein brought him to New York in 1933 to start a ballet company. He famously decided to start a school, where he could train dancers in the style he wanted, and so the School of American Ballet was founded in 1934. Many of his most famous neoclassical ballets were choreographed in the United States, on both his school eventually his own company, the New York City Ballet, which he founded in 1948 and still exists today. Well-known neoclassical ballets like &quot;Concerto Barocco&quot;, (1941), &quot;Four Temperaments&quot;, (1946), &quot;Agon&quot;, (1957), and &quot;Episodes&quot;, (1959) were all choreographed in New York.
==Significant choreographers and works==

Although much of Balanchine&#x27;s work epitomized the genre, some choreographers like the British Frederick Ashton and Kenneth MacMillan were also great neoclassical choreographers.

<text>Benny Peter Agbayani, Jr. (; born December 28, 1971) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Colorado Rockies, Boston Red Sox, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Chiba Lotte Marines.

==Career==
===Minor leagues===
He was originally drafted by the California Angels but did not sign. Agbayani was later drafted in the 30th round by the New York Mets on June 3, 1993. He became a local star at the Triple-A minor league team, the Norfolk Tides.

As a minor league player in the spring of 1995, Agbayani was on a 40-man MLB roster as a replacement player during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. For this reason, he is not allowed union membership.

===New York Mets===
Agbayani made his major league debut with the New York Mets on June 17, 1998, as part of an 8th-inning double-switch in which he defensively replaced center fielder Butch Huskey during a 5–4 loss to the Montreal Expos. He made his first start and picked up his first big league hit on June 19. Agbayani led off the bottom of the first inning by singling to second base off Florida Marlins pitcher Brian Meadows.
His 11 home runs prior to the All Star break in 1999 was the second-most by a Mets rookie, behind Ron Swoboda (15, in 1965); Ike Davis also had 11 in 2010. Swoboda&#x27;s record was subsequently broken by Pete Alonso, with 30 homers by the break in 2019.

On August 12, 2000, while a member of the Mets, Agbayani was involved in a particularly memorable play. In the fourth inning, with the Mets leading 1–0, the Giants loaded the bases after a double, an error, and a hit batsman. With one out, Giants catcher Bobby Estalella hit a fly pop to Agbayani in left field. Agbayani, thinking that the catch made three outs, gave the ball to a child, Jake Burns, in the stands and began to trot toward the dugout. Upon realizing his mistake, Agbayani sprinted back to the stands, pulled the ball from the hands of Burns, and fired a throw toward home plate. Unfortunately for Agbayani, once the ball left the field, the play was dead, and all three runners were awarded two bases—causing Jeff Kent and Ellis Burks to score, and the Giants to take the lead, 2–1. The Mets came back to win the game, 3–2, and Agbayani gave another ball to the boy.

Agbayani is also fondly remembered by Mets fans for two clutch home runs hit during the 2000 season, earning him the nickname &quot;Hawaiian Punch&quot; (after the popular fruit drink). On March 30, his 11th inning grand slam against the Chicago Cubs gave the Mets their first win of the season, and a split in the two-game series the Mets and Cubs played in Tokyo, Japan. (It remained the only regular-season MLB grand slam ever hit in Japan until Domingo Santana hit one for the Seattle Mariners vs the Oakland Athletics on March 20, 2019.) Later that year, on October 7, he hit a game-winning home run in the 13th inning of Game 3 of the National League Division Series against Aaron Fultz of the Giants. Agbayani also drove in the winning run in the only game the Mets won in the 2000 World Series.

===Colorado Rockies===
On January 21, 2002, Agbayani was part of a 10-player, three-team trade between the Mets, Rockies and Milwaukee Brewers, that sent him from New York to Colorado. He struggled in 48 games with the Rockies, hitting .205 with four home runs and 19 RBI before he was placed on waivers in late August.

===Boston Red Sox===
The Boston Red Sox selected Agbayani off waivers from the Rockies on August 26, 2002, as the club made a drive for the playoffs. He played relatively well down the stretch, hitting .297 and driving in eight runs in 37 at-bats over 13 games with Boston. In his final MLB game, September 29, Agbayani went 1-for-4 with a walk and a strikeout as the Red Sox defeated the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Fenway Park.

===Nippon Professional Baseball===
On October 26, 2005, Agbayani and the Chiba Lotte Marines swept the Hanshin Tigers in 4 games during the Japan Series. This was the Marines&#x27; first title in 31 years. On November 13, 2005, they won the inaugural Asia Series after defeating the champions of South Korea, China, and Taiwan. They defeated the Samsung Lions in the championship and Agbayani was named MVP of the series. Agbayani&#x27;s manager with Chiba Lotte was his manager with the Mets, Bobby Valentine. He retired following the 2009 season, his sixth in Japan.

== Personal life ==
Agbayani is of Filipino, Samoan, and Hawaiian descent. He attended Saint Louis School, Hawaii Pacific University and the Oregon Institute of Technology (Oregon Tech).

Agbayani and his wife Niela have three children; daughters Aleia and Ailana and son Bruin. Aleia attended UC Berkeley where she played for their softball team from 2020 to 2023. After graduating from Cal in the spring of 2023, she is pursuing master&#x27;s degree in public health at Brigham Young University and playing softball in the 2024 season. Ailana also attended Brigham Young University and played softball in the 2024 season. Ailana transferred to the University of Oklahoma for the 2025 season. Bruin is currently a high school baseball star for Saint Louis School who has committed to play for the University of Michigan starting in 2025.

Following his retirement, Agbayani was hired as an educational assistant at Mililani High School in Oahu in 2010.

 Agbayani was a ramp agent for Hawaiian Airlines. He was also the softball head coach at ʻIolani School in Honolulu, where both of his daughters attended as well as played softball.

<text>William Drake Westervelt (December 26, 1849 – March 9, 1939) was the author of several books and magazines on Hawaiian history and legends. He drew upon the collections of David Malo, Samuel Kamakau, and Abraham Fornander to popularize Hawaiian folklore in his &quot;Legends of Maui&quot; (1910), &quot;Legends of Old Honolulu&quot; (1915), &quot;Legends of Gods and Ghost-Gods&quot; (1915), &quot;Hawaiian Legends of Volcanoes&quot; (1916) and &quot;Hawaiian Historical Legends&quot; (1923).

==Biography==
Rev. William D. Westervelt was born in Oberlin, Ohio. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1871 with a B.A. degree, and from Oberlin Theological Seminary in 1874 with a B.D. degree. Pastor of churches in Cleveland, Ohio and Colorado, he settled in Hawaii in 1899, marrying a missionary descendant, Caroline Dickinson Castle (1859–1941). After the Hawaiian Historical Society was re-formed, he served as the Corresponding Secretary starting in 1908. He would later serve as treasurer and president.

Westervelt&#x27;s interest in Hawaiian mythology was an avocation that led to numerous magazine and newspaper articles, many reprinted in his several collections. He is noted as one of Hawaii&#x27;s foremost authorities on island folklore in the English language. His anthologies of Hawaiian myths, legends and folk tales are considered among the best of the English versions of a Hawaiian view of the sacred and profane.

Oberlin College bestowed an honorary Doctor of Divinity on Westervelt in 1926. He died at his Waikiki home in March 1939.

<doc id="819602" wikidata="Q3559737" url="?curid=819602" title="Harry Agganis">
<text>Aristotle George &quot;Harry&quot; Agganis (April 20, 1929 – June 27, 1955), nicknamed &quot;The Golden Greek&quot;, was an American college football player and professional baseball player. After passing up a potential professional football career, he played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from 1954 to 1955 for the Boston Red Sox.

Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, to Greek immigrants Georgios Agganis and Georgia Papalimperis, Agganis first gained notice as a college football player at Boston University, becoming its first student named All-American. He passed up a professional career with the Cleveland Browns in order to play his favorite sport, baseball, close to his hometown. He signed a bonus baby contract, and after one season playing minor league baseball, he started at first base for the Red Sox.

In 1955, Agganis became gravely ill early in the season and was hospitalized for two weeks for pneumonia. He rejoined the Red Sox for a single week before being rehospitalized with a viral infection. After showing some signs of recovery, he died of a pulmonary embolism on June 27.

==Early life==
Aristotle George Agganis () was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, United States, growing up with four brothers and two sisters. His family was from Longanikos, Sparta, Greece. He was a star football and baseball player at Lynn Classical High School as well as a strong student, named &quot;All-Scholastic&quot;.

== College career ==
Agganis enrolled at Boston University, where he became a starter, primarily at quarterback. After his sophomore season in 1949, when he set a school record by tossing fifteen touchdown passes, he entered the Marine Corps. Agganis played for the Camp Lejeune (N.C.) football and baseball teams. He received a dependency discharge from the Marines to support his mother and returned to college to play in 1951–52. Around the same time, Agganis was participating in summer baseball leagues in Augusta, Maine.

Agganis became the school&#x27;s first All-American in football and Boston coach Buff Donelli named Agganis the &quot;greatest football player he ever coached&quot;. He also played basketball and baseball in the school.

Agganis set another Boston University mark by passing for for the season and won the Bulger Lowe Award as New England&#x27;s outstanding football player. Coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns thought he could be the successor to Otto Graham and drafted the college junior in the first round of the 1952 NFL draft, offering him a bonus of $25,000. Boston Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey outbid Brown, however, and signed Agganis to play Major League Baseball for the Red Sox as a first baseman for $35,000. At the time of his death, Agganis was spending his off-season at his alma mater as an assistant coach, tutoring Tom Gastall, another quarterback who decided to play professional baseball and died young.

== Baseball career ==
Following his 1953 college graduation, Agganis played with Triple-A Louisville where he hit .281 with 23 home runs and 108 RBI. He made his major league debut on April 13, 1954. Agganis had a modest rookie campaign, although he did lead American League first basemen in assists and fielding percentage. He hit 11 home runs that year, with 57 RBI and a .251 batting average.

==Death==

In 1955, Agganis briefly lost his starting position to rookie Norm Zauchin. On June 2, he was hospitalized with pneumonia, severe fever and chest pains. He rejoined the Red Sox ten days later and played two games against the Chicago White Sox, before falling ill again in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 5. He was diagnosed with a viral infection and flown back to Sancta Maria Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where a doctor partially blamed his playing too soon after the first illness. The Red Sox placed him on the voluntary retired list until he recuperated, an early version of the disabled list. He began showing signs of improvement, before a fatal pulmonary embolism on June 27.

Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin told the Associated Press that everyone related to the Red Sox organization was &quot;grieved and shocked&quot;, calling Agganis &quot;a grand boy&quot;, and saying the team would wear #6 black armbands to honor him. American League president Will Harridge said his office was &quot;saddened and shocked&quot;, and Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey said he was &quot;stunned&quot;, calling Agganis &quot;a man of great character&quot;. Ten thousand mourners saw his body lie in state at St. George&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Church in Lynn.

==Legacy==
Agganis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. Gaffney Street, near the former site of Braves Field in Boston, was renamed &quot;Harry Agganis Way&quot; in 1995.

Agganis Arena is a multipurpose sports facility at Boston University. The Harry Agganis Stadium located on Camp Lejeune was named in his honor.

The Agganis Foundation has awarded more than $1.1 million in college scholarships to 780 student-athletes from Boston and the North Shore, including Lynn. Scholarships are awarded for academic and athletic achievement. The Foundation was started in 1955 by the Boston Red Sox and owner Thomas A. Yawkey, the (Lynn) &quot;Daily Item&quot; newspaper and Harold O. Zimman, a mentor of Agganis for whom the football field at Tufts University is named.

According to an episode of &quot;The Extraordinary&quot;, which retells stories of people&#x27;s supernatural experiences, actor Telly Savalas unknowingly met a ghost who said he knew a player from the Boston Red Sox, and the next day Telly saw in the newspaper headlines that a 26-year-old player had died of mysterious circumstances.
