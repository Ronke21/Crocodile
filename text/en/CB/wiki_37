<text>Mod, from the word &quot;modernist&quot;, is a subculture that began in late 1950s London and spread throughout Great Britain, eventually influencing fashions and trends in other countries. It continues today on a smaller scale. Focused on music and fashion, the subculture has its roots in a small group of stylish London-based young men and women in the late 1950s who were termed &quot;modernists&quot; because they listened to modern jazz. Elements of the mod subculture include fashion (often tailor-made suits); music (including soul, rhythm and blues, ska and mainly jazz) and motor scooters (usually Lambretta or Vespa). In the mid-1960s when they started to fade out, the subculture listened to rock groups with R&amp;B influences such as the Who and Small Faces. The original mod scene was associated with amphetamine-fuelled all-night jazz dancing at clubs.

During the early to mid-1960s, as mod grew and spread throughout Britain, certain elements of the mod scene became engaged in well-publicised clashes with members of a rival subculture: rockers. The mods and rockers conflict led sociologist Stanley Cohen to use the term &quot;moral panic&quot; in his study about the two youth subcultures, in which he examined media coverage of the mod and rocker riots in the 1960s.

By 1965, conflicts between mods and rockers began to subside and mods increasingly gravitated towards pop art and psychedelia. London became synonymous with fashion, music, and pop culture in these years, a period often referred to as &quot;Swinging London&quot;. During this time, mod fashions spread to other countries; mod was then viewed less as an isolated subculture, but as emblematic of the larger youth culture of the era.

As mod became more cosmopolitan during the &quot;Swinging London&quot; period, some working class &quot;street mods&quot; splintered off, forming other groups such as the skinheads. In the late 1970s, there was a mod revival in Britain which attempted to replicate the &quot;scooter&quot; period look and styles of the early to mid-1960s. It was followed by a similar mod revival in North America in the early 1980s, particularly in southern California.

==Etymology and usage==
The term &quot;mod&quot; derives from &quot;modernist&quot;, a term used in the 1950s to describe modern jazz musicians and fans. This usage contrasted with the term &quot;trad&quot;, which described traditional jazz players and fans. The 1959 novel &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; describes modernists as young modern jazz fans who dress in sharp modern Italian clothes. The novel may be one of the earliest examples of the term being written to describe young British style-conscious modern jazz fans. This usage of the word &quot;modernist&quot; should not be confused with &quot;modernism&quot; in the context of literature, art, design and architecture. From the mid-to-late 1960s onwards, the mass media often used the term &quot;mod&quot; in a wider sense to describe anything that was believed to be popular, fashionable or modern.

Paul Jobling and David Crowley argued that the definition of &quot;mod&quot; can be difficult to pin down, because throughout the subculture&#x27;s original era, it was &quot;prone to continuous reinvention.&quot; They claimed that since the mod scene was so pluralist, the word &quot;mod&quot; was an umbrella term that covered several distinct sub-scenes. Terry Rawlings argued that mods are difficult to define because the subculture started out as a &quot;mysterious semi-secret world&quot;, which the Who&#x27;s manager Peter Meaden summarised as &quot;clean living under difficult circumstances.&quot;

== History 1958–1969 ==
George Melly wrote that mods were initially a small group of clothes-focused English working class young men insisting on clothes and shoes tailored to their style, who emerged during the modern jazz boom of the late 1950s. Early mods watched French and Italian art films and read Italian magazines to look for style ideas. They usually held semi-skilled manual jobs or low grade white-collar positions such as a clerk, messenger or office boy. According to Dick Hebdige, mods created a parody of the consumer society that they lived in.

===Early 1960s===
According to Hebdige, by around 1963, the mod subculture had gradually accumulated the identifying symbols that later came to be associated with the scene, such as scooters, amphetamine pills and R&amp;B music. While clothes were still important at that time, they could be ready-made. Dick Hebdige wrote the term &quot;mod&quot; covered a number of styles including the emergence of Swinging London, though to him it defined Melly&#x27;s working class clothes-conscious teenagers living in London and south England in the early to mid-1960s.

Mary Anne Long argued that &quot;first hand accounts and contemporary theorists point to the Jewish upper-working or middle-class of London&#x27;s East End and suburbs.&quot; Simon Frith asserted that the mod subculture had its roots in the 1950s beatnik coffee bar culture, which catered to art school students in the radical Bohemian scene in London. Steve Sparks, whose claim is to be one of the original mods, agrees that before mod became commercialised, it was essentially an extension of the beatnik culture: &quot;It comes from &#x27;modernist&#x27;, it was to do with modern jazz and to do with Sartre&quot; and existentialism. Sparks argued that &quot;Mod has been much misunderstood ... as this working-class, scooter-riding precursor of skinheads.&quot;
Coffee bars were attractive to British youth because, in contrast to typical pubs, which closed at about 11 pm, they were open until the early hours of the morning. Coffee bars had jukeboxes, which in some cases reserved space in the machines for the customers&#x27; own records. In the late 1950s, coffee bars were associated with jazz and blues, but in the early 1960s, they began playing more R&amp;B music. Frith noted that although coffee bars were originally aimed at middle-class art school students, they began to facilitate an intermixing of youth from different backgrounds and classes. At these venues, which Frith called the &quot;first sign of the youth movement&quot;, young people met collectors of R&amp;B and blues records.

As the mod subculture grew in London during the early-to-mid-1960s, tensions arose between the mods, often riding highly decorated motor scooters, and their main rivals, the rockers, a British subculture who favoured rockabilly, early rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, motorcycles and leather jackets, and considered the mods effeminate because of their interest in fashion. There were some violent clashes between the two groups. This period was later immortalised by songwriter Pete Townshend, in the Who&#x27;s 1973 concept album, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. After 1964, clashes between the two groups largely subsided, as mod expanded and came to be accepted by the larger youth generation throughout the UK as a symbol of all that was new. During this time London became a mecca for rock music, with popular bands such as the Who and Small Faces appealing to a largely mod audience, as well as the preponderance of hip fashions, in a period often referred to as Swinging London.

===Mid-late 1960s===
====Swinging London====

As numerous British rock bands of the mid-1960s began to adopt a mod look and following, the scope of the subculture grew beyond its original confines and the focus began to change. By 1966, proletarian aspects of the scene in London had waned as fashion and pop-culture elements continued to grow, not only in England, but elsewhere.

This period, portrayed by Alberto Sordi&#x27;s film in &quot;Thank you very much&quot;, and in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Blowup,&quot; was typified by pop art, Carnaby Street boutiques, live music, and discothèques. Many associate this era with fashion model Twiggy, miniskirts, and bold geometrical patterns on brightly coloured clothes. During these years, it exerted a considerable influence on the worldwide spread of mod.

====United States and elsewhere====

As mod was going through transformation in England, it became all the rage in the United States and around the world, as many young people adopted its look. However, the worldwide experience differed from that of the early scene in London in that it was based mainly on the pop culture aspect, influenced by British rock musicians. By now, mod was thought of more as a general youth-culture style rather than as a separate subgroup among different contentious factions.

American musicians, in the wake of the British Invasion, adopted the look of mod clothes, longer hairstyles, and Beatle boots. The exploitation documentary &quot;Mondo Mod&quot; provides a glimpse at mod&#x27;s influence on the Sunset Strip and West Hollywood scene of late 1966. Mod increasingly became associated with psychedelic rock and the early hippie movement, and by 1967 more exotic looks, such as Nehru jackets and love beads came into vogue. Its trappings were reflected on popular American TV shows such as &quot;Laugh-In&quot; and &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;.

====Decline====
Dick Hebdige argued that the subculture lost its vitality when it became commercialised and stylised to the point that mod clothing styles were being created &quot;from above&quot; by clothing companies and by TV shows like &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, rather than being developed by young people customising their clothes and combining different fashions.

As psychedelic rock and the hippie subculture grew more popular in the United Kingdom, much of mod, for a time, seemed intertwined with those movements. However, it dissipated after 1968, as tastes began to favor a less style-conscious, denim and tie-dyed look, along with a decreased interest in nightlife. Bands such as the Who and Small Faces began to change and, by the end of the decade, moved away from mod. Additionally, the original mods of the early 1960s were coming to the age of marriage and child-rearing, which meant many of them no longer had the time or money for their youthful pastimes of club-going, record-shopping, and buying clothes.

==Later developments 1969–present==
===Offshoots===
Some street-oriented mods, usually of lesser means, sometimes referred to as &quot;hard mods,&quot; remained active well into the late 1960s, but tended to become increasingly detached from the Swinging London scene and the burgeoning hippie movement. By 1967, they considered most of the people in the Swinging London scene to be &quot;soft mods&quot; or &quot;peacock mods&quot;, as styles, there, became increasingly extravagant, often featuring highly ruffled, brocaded, or laced fabrics in Day-Glo colours.

Many of the hard mods lived in the same economically depressed areas of South London as West Indian immigrants, so these mods favoured a different kind of attire, that emulated the rude boy look of Trilby hats and too-short trousers. These Mods listened to Jamaican ska and mingled with black rude boys at West Indian nightclubs like Ram Jam, A-Train and Sloopy&#x27;s. Hebdige claimed that the hard mods were drawn to black culture and ska music in part because the educated, middle-class hippie movement&#x27;s drug-orientated and intellectual music did not have any relevance for them. He argued that the hard mods were attracted to ska because it was a secret, underground, non-commercialised music that was disseminated through informal channels such as house parties and clubs.

By the end of the 1960s, the hard mods had become known as skinheads, who, in their early days, would be known for the same love of soul, rocksteady and early reggae. Because of their fascination with black culture, the early skinheads were, except in isolated situations, largely devoid of the overt racism and fascism that would later become associated with whole wings of the movement in the mid to late 1970s. The early skinheads retained basic elements of mod fashion—such as Fred Perry and Ben Sherman shirts, Sta-Prest trousers and Levi&#x27;s jeans—but mixed them with working class-orientated accessories such as braces and Dr. Martens work boots. Hebdige claimed that as early as the Margate and Brighton brawls between mods and rockers, some mods were seen wearing boots and braces and sporting close cropped haircuts (for practical reasons, as long hair was a liability in industrial jobs and street fights).

Mods and ex-mods were also part of the early northern soul scene, a subculture based on obscure 1960s and 1970s American soul records. Some mods evolved into, or merged with, subcultures such as individualists, stylists, and scooterboys.

===Revivals and later influence===
A mod revival started in the late 1970s in the United Kingdom, with thousands of mod revivalists attending scooter rallies in locations such as Scarborough and the Isle of Wight. This revival was partly inspired by the 1979 film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, which explores the original 1960s movement, and by mod-influenced bands such as the Jam, Secret Affair, the Lambrettas, Purple Hearts, the Specials and the Chords, who drew on the energy of new wave music.
The British mod revival was followed by a revival in North America in the early 1980s, particularly in Southern California, led by bands such as the Untouchables. The mod scene in Los Angeles and Orange County was partly influenced by the 2 Tone ska revival in England, and was unique in its racial diversity, with black, white, Hispanic and Asian participants. The 1990s Britpop scene featured noticeable mod influences on bands such as Oasis, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene and the Bluetones. Popular 21st century musicians Miles Kane and Jake Bugg are also followers of the mod subculture.

==Characteristics==
Dick Hebdige argued that when trying to understand 1960s mod culture, one has to try and &quot;penetrate and decipher the mythology of the mods&quot;. Terry Rawlings argued that the mod scene developed when British teenagers began to reject the &quot;dull, timid, old-fashioned, and uninspired&quot; British culture around them, with its repressed and class-obsessed mentality and its . Mods rejected the &quot;faulty pap&quot; of 1950s pop music and sappy love songs. They aimed at being &quot;cool, neat, sharp, hip, and smart&quot; by embracing &quot;all things sexy and streamlined&quot;, especially when they were new, exciting, controversial or modern. Hebdige claimed that the mod subculture came about as part of the participants&#x27; desire to understand the &quot;mysterious complexity of the metropolis&quot; and to get close to black culture of the Jamaican rude boy, because mods felt that black culture &quot;ruled the night hours&quot; and that it had more streetwise &quot;savoir faire&quot;. Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss argued that at the &quot;core of the British Mod rebellion was a blatant fetishising of the American consumer culture&quot; that had &quot;eroded the moral fiber of England.&quot; In doing so, the mods &quot;mocked the class system that had gotten their fathers nowhere&quot; and created a &quot;rebellion based on consuming pleasures&quot;.

The influence of British newspapers on creating the public perception of mods as having a leisure-filled club-going lifestyle can be seen in a 1964 article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The paper interviewed a 17-year-old mod who went out clubbing seven nights a week and spent Saturday afternoons shopping for clothes and records. However, few British teens and young adults would have had the time and money to spend this much time going to nightclubs. Paul Jobling and David Crowley argued that most young mods worked 9 to 5 at semi-skilled jobs, which meant that they had much less leisure time and only a modest income to spend during their time off.

===Fashion===
Paul Jobling and David Crowley called the mod subculture a &quot;fashion-obsessed and hedonistic cult of the hyper-cool&quot; young adults who lived in metropolitan London or the new towns of the south. Due to the increasing affluence of post-war Britain, the youths of the early 1960s were one of the first generations that did not have to contribute their money from after-school jobs to the family finances. As mod teens and young adults began using their disposable income to buy stylish clothes, the first youth-targeted boutique clothing stores opened in London in the Carnaby Street and King&#x27;s Road districts. The streets&#x27; names became symbols of, one magazine later stated, &quot;an endless frieze of mini-skirted, booted, fair-haired angular angels&quot;. Newspaper accounts from the mid-1960s focused on the mod obsession with clothes, often detailing the prices of the expensive suits worn by young mods, and seeking out extreme cases such as a young mod who claimed that he would &quot;go without food to buy clothes&quot;.

Two youth subcultures helped pave the way for mod fashion by breaking new ground: the beatniks, with their Bohemian image of berets and black turtlenecks, and the Teddy Boys, from whom mod fashion inherited its &quot;narcissistic and fastidious [fashion] tendencies&quot; and the immaculate dandy look. The Teddy Boys paved the way for making male interest in fashion socially acceptable. Prior to the Teddy Boys, male interest in fashion in Britain was often associated with underground homosexuals&#x27; subculture and dressing style.

Jobling and Crowley argued that for working class mods, the subculture&#x27;s focus on fashion and music was a release from the &quot;humdrum of daily existence&quot; at their jobs. Jobling and Crowley noted that while the subculture had strong elements of consumerism and shopping, mods were not passive consumers; instead they were very self-conscious and critical, customising &quot;existing styles, symbols and artefacts&quot; such as the Union flag and the Royal Air Force roundel, and putting them on their jackets in a pop art-style, and putting their personal signatures on their style. Mods adopted new Italian and French styles in part as a reaction to the rural and small-town rockers, with their 1950s-style leather motorcycle clothes and American greaser look.

Male mods adopted a smooth, sophisticated look that included tailor-made suits with narrow lapels (sometimes made of mohair), thin ties, button-down collar shirts, wool or cashmere jumpers (crewneck or V-neck), Chelsea or Beatle boots, loafers, Clarks desert boots, bowling shoes, and hairstyles that imitated the look of French &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; film actors. A big part of the Mod look was borrowed from the Ivy League collegiate style from the United States. A few male mods went against gender norms by using eye shadow, eye-pencil or even lipstick. Mods chose scooters over motorbikes partly because they were a symbol of Italian style and because their body panels concealed moving parts and made them less likely to stain clothes with oil or road dust. Many mods wore ex-military parkas while driving scooters to keep their clothes clean.

Many female mods dressed androgynously, with short haircuts, men&#x27;s trousers or shirts, flat shoes, and little makeup – often just pale foundation, brown eye shadow, white or pale lipstick and false eyelashes. British fashion designer Mary Quant, who helped popularize the miniskirt, is credited for popularizing mod subculture. Miniskirts became progressively shorter between the early and mid-1960s. As female mod fashion became more mainstream, slender models like Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy began to exemplify the mod look. Maverick fashion designers emerged, such as Quant, who was known for her miniskirt designs, and John Stephen, who sold a line named &quot;His Clothes&quot; and whose clients included bands such as Small Faces. The television programme &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; helped spread awareness of mod fashions to a larger audience. Mod-culture continues to influence fashion, with the ongoing trend for mod-inspired styles such as 3-button suits, Chelsea boots and mini dresses. The Mod Revival of the 1980s and 1990s led to a new era of mod-inspired fashion, driven by bands such as Madness, the Specials and Oasis. The popularity of the This Is England film and TV series also kept mod fashion in the public eye. Today&#x27;s mod icons include Miles Kane (frontman of the Last Shadow Puppets), cyclist Bradley Wiggins and Paul Weller, &#x27;The ModFather&#x27;.

===Music===
The early mods listened to the &quot;sophisticated smoother modern jazz&quot; of musicians such as Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Dave Brubeck and the Modern Jazz Quartet, as well as the American rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) of artists such as Bo Diddley and Muddy Waters. The music scene of the Mods was a mix of modern jazz, R&amp;B, psychedelic rock and soul. Terry Rawlings wrote that mods became &quot;dedicated to R&amp;B and their own dances.&quot; Black American servicemen, stationed in Britain during the early part of the Cold War, brought over R&amp;B and soul records that were unavailable in Britain, and they often sold these to young people in London. Starting around 1960, mods embraced the off-beat, Jamaican ska music of artists such as the Skatalites, Owen Gray, Derrick Morgan and Prince Buster on record labels such as Melodisc, Starlite and Bluebeat.

The original mods gathered at all-night clubs such as The Flamingo and The Marquee in London to hear the latest records and show off their dance moves. As the mod subculture spread across the United Kingdom, other clubs became popular, including Twisted Wheel Club in Manchester.

The British R&amp;B/rock bands the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds and the Kinks all had mod followings, and other bands emerged that were specifically mod-oriented. These included the Who, Small Faces, the Creation, the Action, the Smoke and John&#x27;s Children. The Who&#x27;s early promotional material tagged them as playing &quot;maximum rhythm and blues&quot;, and a name change in 1964 from The Who to The High Numbers was an attempt to cater even more to the mod market. After the commercial failure of the single &quot;Zoot Suit/I&#x27;m the Face&quot;, the band changed its name back to The Who. Although the Beatles dressed like mods for a while (after dressing like rockers earlier), their beat music was not as popular as British R&amp;B among mods.

===Amphetamines===
A notable part of the mod subculture was recreational amphetamine use, which was used to fuel all-night dances at clubs. Newspaper reports described dancers emerging from clubs at 5 a.m. with dilated pupils. Some mods consumed a combined amphetamine/barbiturate called Drinamyl, nicknamed &quot;purple hearts&quot;. Due to this association with amphetamines, Pete Meaden&#x27;s &quot;clean living&quot; aphorism about the mod subculture may seem contradictory, but the drug was still legal in Britain in the early 1960s, and mods used the drug for stimulation and alertness, which they viewed as different from the intoxication caused by alcohol and other drugs. Andrew Wilson argued that for a significant minority, &quot;amphetamines symbolised the smart, on-the-ball, cool image&quot; and that they sought &quot;stimulation not intoxication ... greater awareness, not escape&quot; and &quot;confidence and articulacy&quot; rather than the &quot;drunken rowdiness of previous generations&quot;.

Wilson argued that the significance of amphetamines to the mod culture was similar to that of LSD and cannabis within the subsequent hippie counterculture. Dick Hebdige argued that mods used amphetamines to extend their leisure time into the early hours of the morning and as a way of bridging the gap between their hostile and daunting everyday work lives and the &quot;inner world&quot; of dancing and dressing up in their off-hours.

===Scooters===

Many mods drove motor scooters, usually Vespas or Lambrettas. Scooters were a practical and affordable form of transportation for 1960s teens, since until the early 1970s, public transport stopped relatively early in the night. For teens with low-paying jobs, scooters were cheaper and easier to park than cars, and they could be bought through newly available hire purchase plans.
Mods also treated scooters as a fashion accessory. Italian scooters were preferred due to their clean-lined, curving shapes and gleaming chrome, with sales driven by close associations between dealerships and clubs, such as the Ace of Herts.

For young mods, Italian scooters were the &quot;embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing&quot;. Mods customised their scooters by painting them in &quot;two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [them] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights&quot;. Some mods added four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. They often put their names on the small windscreen. They sometimes took their engine side panels and front bumpers to electroplating shops to get them covered in highly reflective chrome.

Hard mods (who later evolved into the skinheads) began riding scooters more for practical reasons. Their scooters were either unmodified or cutdown, which was nicknamed a &quot;skelly&quot;. Lambrettas were cutdown to the bare frame, and the unibody (monocoque)-design Vespas had their body panels slimmed down or reshaped.
After the seaside resort brawls, the media began to associate Italian scooters with violent mods. Much later, writers described groups of mods riding scooters together as a &quot;menacing symbol of group solidarity&quot; that was &quot;converted into a weapon&quot;. With events like the 6 November 1966, &quot;scooter charge&quot; on Buckingham Palace, the scooter, along with the mods&#x27; short hair and suits, began to be seen as a symbol of subversion.

===Gender roles===
Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson argued in 1993 that compared to other youth subcultures, the mod scene gave young women high visibility and relative autonomy. They wrote that this status may have been related both to the attitudes of the mod young men, who accepted the idea that a young woman did not have to be attached to a man, and to the development of new occupations for young women, which gave them an income and made them more independent. Hall and Jefferson noted the increasing number of jobs in boutiques and women&#x27;s clothing stores, which, while poorly paid and lacking opportunities for advancement, gave young women disposable income, status and a glamorous sense of dressing up and going into town to work.

Hall and Jefferson argued that the presentable image of female mod fashions meant it was easier for young mod women to integrate with the non-subculture aspects of their lives (home, school and work) than for members of other subcultures. The emphasis on clothing and a stylised look for women demonstrated the &quot;same fussiness for detail in clothes&quot; as their male mod counterparts.

Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss claimed that the emphasis in the mod subculture on consumerism and shopping was the &quot;ultimate affront to male working-class traditions&quot; in the United Kingdom, because in the working-class tradition, shopping was usually done by women. They argued that British mods were &quot;worshipping leisure and money ... scorning the masculine world of hard work and honest labour&quot; by spending their time listening to music, collecting records, socialising, and dancing at all-night clubs.

===Conflicts with rockers===

In early-1960s Britain, the two main youth subcultures were mods and rockers. Mods were described in 2012 as &quot;effeminate, stuck-up, emulating the middle classes, aspiring to a competitive sophistication, snobbish, [and] phony&quot;, and rockers as &quot;hopelessly naive, loutish, [and] scruffy&quot;, emulating the motorcycle gang members in the film &quot;The Wild One&quot;, by wearing leather jackets and riding motorcycles. Dick Hebdige claimed in 2006 that the &quot;mods rejected the rocker&#x27;s crude conception of masculinity, the transparency of his motivations, his clumsiness&quot;; the rockers viewed the vanity and obsession with clothes of the mods as immasculine.

Scholars debate how much contact the two subcultures had during the 1960s. Hebdige argued that mods and rockers had little contact with each other because they tended to come from different regions of England (mods from London and rockers from rural areas), and because they had &quot;totally disparate goals and lifestyles&quot;. Mark Gilman, however, claimed that both mods and rockers could be seen at football matches.

John Covach wrote that in the United Kingdom, rockers were often engaged in brawls with mods. BBC News stories from May 1964 stated that mods and rockers were jailed after riots in seaside resort towns on the south and east coasts of England, such as Margate, Brighton, Bournemouth and Clacton. The &quot;mods and rockers&quot; conflict was explored as an instance of &quot;moral panic&quot; by sociologist Stanley Cohen in his study &quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;, which examined media coverage of the mod and rocker riots in the 1960s. Although Cohen acknowledged that mods and rockers had some fights in the mid-1960s, he argued that they were no different from the evening brawls that occurred between non-mod and non-rocker youths throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, both at seaside resorts and after football games.

Newspapers of the time were eager to describe the mod and rocker clashes as being of &quot;disastrous proportions&quot;, and labelled mods and rockers as &quot;sawdust Caesars&quot;, &quot;vermin&quot; and &quot;louts&quot;. Newspaper editorials fanned the flames of hysteria, such as a &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; editorial in May 1964 which warned that mods and rockers were &quot;internal enemies&quot; in the United Kingdom who would &quot;bring about disintegration of a nation&#x27;s character&quot;. The magazine &quot;Police Review&quot; argued that the mods and rockers&#x27; purported lack of respect for law and order could cause violence to &quot;surge and flame like a forest fire&quot;. As a result of this media coverage, two British members of parliament travelled to the seaside areas to survey the damage, and MP Harold Gurden called for a resolution for intensified measures to control youth hooliganism. One of the prosecutors in the trial of some of the Clacton brawlers argued that mods and rockers were youths with no serious views, who lacked respect for law and order.

<text>The Renault 25 is an executive car produced by the French automaker Renault from 1983 to 1992. 

The 25 was Renault&#x27;s flagship, the most expensive, prestigious, and largest vehicle in the company&#x27;s line up. It placed second in the 1985 European Car of the Year rankings. In total, 780,976 were built from 1983 until 1992.

All 25s were built in Sandouville, near Le Havre, France.

== Introduction ==

Introduced at the end of 1983 for a March 1984 start of sales, the Renault 25 was a large step forward in nearly every aspect from the Renault 20 / Renault 30 range it was replacing. Its five-door liftback body was penned by designers Gaston Juchet and Robert Opron of Citroën SM fame, and the unconventional style was aimed at giving the car a notchback look in order to overcome customer preference outside France for formal sedans in the segment outside of France. The wraparound rear window was one of Opron&#x27;s signature design features, used on many of his earlier designs such as the SM, the Renault Fuego, and the Renault 11.

The 25 was one of the first cars designed from the start for aerodynamic efficiency giving a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31, a key factor in improving fuel economy. The TS model briefly held the unofficial title of &quot;world&#x27;s most aerodynamic mass production car&quot; with a Cd of 0.28, and at its launch, the 25 was easily the best in its class for fuel economy.

All Renault 25 models were front-wheel drive, with four-cylinder (2 and 2.2 L petrol injection or 2.1 L diesel) and six-cylinder (2849 cc and 2458 cc turbo injection) engines mounted longitudinally forward of the front axle. The 25&#x27;s performance was above average for its class, at least in the V6 Turbo specification. A turbodiesel version of the J8S engine was also available.

The 25 was praised for its ride comfort and spirited handling (despite slight understeer, and torque steer on V6 Turbo models). A newly designed manual transmission drew unanimous praise for its precision and smoothness (although the detent spring on fifth gear could cause misselection of third gear). The futuristic interior was executed by Italian designer Marcello Gandini (of Lamborghini fame) and was somewhat controversial, but the 25&#x27;s passenger compartment was considered quiet, spacious, and well lit.

Equipment levels were high and set new standards for French cars, the 25 including among other features, an express up and down feature on the driver&#x27;s power window, voice alerts (covering items such as improperly shut doors/bonnet/boot – oil pressure, engine temperature/charging circuit and blown bulbs), and one of the world&#x27;s first remote stereo controls, mounted to the right of the steering column (controlling volume +/–, station search, station select (jog wheel) in radio mode with volume +/–, mute and track advance (if supported)). For the first time since World War II, Renault had an entry in the full-size market segment outside France.

== Automatic transmission ==
The Renault 25&#x27;s least durable part was the automatic transmission. As a result, most 25s remaining are the five-speed manual and few automatics have survived. Three automatic transmissions were used on R25: MJ3, 4141, both three-speed, and a new four-speed AR4, later used on the Renault Safrane as AD4/AD8. Due to the poor quality and design of the ATF cooler, especially on the later AR4, these versions have gained a poor reputation for reliability. A leaking ATF cooler could lead to gearbox failure with little or no physical warning, except for ATF stains beneath the vehicle to which not all drivers paid attention or not quickly enough.

The first transmissions started failing within a few years, while the model was still in production. Renault then prepared a package that was to replace the original poor-quality cooler regardless of vehicle age and mileage. However, the cooler location in front of the right wheel could not be changed. As a result, Renault 25 Automatics with the AR4 transmission are rare today.

== Facelift ==
The car underwent a facelift in June 1988, with a new front end, taillights, interior materials, and front suspension. Essentially, every panel was changed on the facelifted car, with the intent to smooth the styling. The new version also featured more powerful engines, the 2.2i engine being dropped and replaced by a 12v version of the 2.0i engine which produced .

There were a small number of run-out post-facelift cars fitted with the 2.2i engine, mainly to use up stocks. Power increased marginally and these were rated at . The 2.2 engine was removed from French listings in 1990 but production continued for certain export markets until production of the 25 ended in February 1992, to make way for the Renault Safrane.

== Trim levels ==

French market specifications:

* Level 1: Power steering, front power windows, and sound system optional. No side body cladding or rear window wiper. Single beam headlights.
* Level 2: Power steering, front power windows, two-speaker stereo, side body cladding, and rear window wiper standard. 2 x 6 W sound system with steering wheel-mounted controls (specially designed by Philips for this model) optional.
* Level 3: Front and rear power windows, power mirrors, and 2 x 6 W Philips sound system standard. Trip computer and digital fuel gauge on gasoline versions. Anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, and 4 x 20 W Philips sound system with steering wheel-mounted controls optional.
* Level 4: 4 x 20 W Philips sound system and express up/down driver&#x27;s power window standard. dual-beam headlights.

* Level 7: Electronically controlled hydraulic system for Baccara models (Variable rate shock absorption suspension. This system can be used in one of two ways: sport or automatic. In automatic mode, the electronic module will control three shock absorption levels known as &quot;comfort&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;sport&quot; mode, which will be selected automatically in accordance with a strategy taking into account the parameters of vehicle speed, longitudinal acceleration, transverse acceleration, vertical acceleration and &quot;stop&quot; lights switch).

=== Renault 25 &quot;Baccara&quot; ===
In October 1988, during phase 2, a particularly luxurious finish was made available on the V6 Injection: &quot;Baccara&quot; (from the [Baccarat (game)|card game] popularized in the film series &quot;007&quot;), available with Amber leather seats only.

From April 1990 (phase 3), with the appearance of the Euro 1 anti-pollution standard requiring a catalytic converter, this finish was added to the V6 Turbo versions which will also have new electronic management of the turbo among others. Thus the V6 Turbo will see their power increase from , while power dropped from for the V6 Injection.

The Baccara phase 3 offers as standard: ABS, front and rear electric windows, automatically regulated air conditioning, cruise control, height-adjustable headrests, leather cover for clothes under the rear parcel shelf, colored leather seats Amber or Cinder exclusively, the &quot;Ergomatic&quot; pack (with airbags for the front seats, memory and electrical adjustment of the driver&#x27;s seat positions), the doors, pillars and roof receive upholstery in [Alcantara (textile)|alcantara ], door strip and gear lever knob are in real elm burl, the 3-spoke leather steering wheel signed &quot;Baccara&quot;. The dashboard is imitation leather.

A spoiler and &quot;Baccara&quot; light alloy rims (BBS spoke rims on V6 Turbo), as well as the &quot;Baccara&quot; monogram on the quarter pillars and the tailgate appear. The shades available are Arabica Brown, Tungsten Gray, Bordeaux Black Sherry&quot;, all decorated with a double gold-colored side stripe. Other colors such as Tyrol Green 999, Prussian Blue 447, Black 676 and Persian Red 777 without forgetting the Bleu Sport 449 for the Turbo were offered almost until the end of marketing.

=== Renault 25 Limousine ===
An extended-wheelbase version of the initial Renault 25 was called the Renault 25 Limousine. It was longer than the standard car and was available in two variants. The standard 25 Limousine had the same rear bench seat as the standard-wheelbase model whereas the Executive version had two individual seats with electric adjustment. The limousine (only available with the 2.7 L V6 for RHD markets) was dropped from the range of Renault UK, within two years of its introduction in 1985, but continued in other European markets.

Coachbuilders, such as Boonaker, provided bulletproof variants as well as fitting 2.5 L V6 Turbo engines. For a time, the President of France used an armored limousine variant of the Renault 25.

=== Renault 25 station wagons ===
A station wagon project from the Heuliez company based on the limousine was proposed to Renault, which refused it. Called the &quot;Sologne&quot;, it was never even turned into a prototype.

A kit from the Belgian company EBS (Ernest Berg Systemes) which also produced the R25 Cabriolet, made it possible to quickly transform a Renault 25 into a Renault 25 shooting brake (station wagon) with a rear tailgate.

== Australia and the United Kingdom ==
The 25 was also exported to Australia. Introduced in 1985, it was priced at A$35,000 without cruise control. It had a disc drum brake setup, rather than four-wheel discs as on the Renault 18.

The R25 was exported to the United Kingdom from the beginning of 1984, where its hatchback body style helped it to stand out compared with conventional saloons.

GTX in the United Kingdom was equivalent to Level 3 in the above list &amp; used the 123 hp 2.2i engine. For the facelift versions the equivalent to the GTX was the TXI, with the 2.0 12v engine of 140 hp. The 12v head from the 2.0 engine was latterly used in the J7T 2.2i engine in Safrane. The 2.2 engine in the Safrane is effectively a long-stroke version of the 2.0 engine – with better torque but less free-revving.

For the United Kingdom, the pre-facelift range included TS, Monaco (being a special edition with metallic brown paint, Monaco badging on the boot and C-Pillar insert panels, Leather interior, and some other changes from the TS spec), GTX, V6 &amp; V6 Turbo.

The facelift cars were TX (2.0 12v/2.2i special order), TXI (2.0i 12v/2.2i special order), V6, V6 Turbo for a short period, and Baccara (2.8i V6/2.5i V6 Turbo) which was the top of the range. The 2.2i (123 hp) engine in the Phase 2 cars was only available &#x27;while stocks last&#x27;. The lower compression 108 hp 2.2 was not sold in the United Kingdom.

== Eagle Premier/Dodge Monaco ==
The Renault 25 was the basis of the car platform for the Canadian-built, full-sized Eagle Premier that was developed by American Motors Corporation (AMC) and introduced in 1988.

The Premier featured exterior styling by Italdesign Giugiaro using the Renault 25 chassis, although the suspension was derived from the Eagle Medallion (Renault 21). The body was a true 4-door sedan with separate trunk lid, rather than a lift-up hatchback. The interior was designed by American Motors.

When introduced, the car was branded as the Eagle Premier, subsequent to Renault selling its 47 percent stake in AMC to Chrysler in 1987. From 1990 to 1992, Chrysler also marketed a rebadged version as the Dodge Monaco.

== Club ==

Throughout the world, there are several clubs concerning this car, particularly in France. &quot;Club Renault 25 Français.&quot; official club, [association law of 1901].

The French Renault 25 club has a large number of parts remanufactured to maintain the Renault 25s.

<text>Ward MacLaughlin Miller (November 29, 1902 – March 11, 1984) was an American politician of the Republican Party. He briefly served in the U.S. House of Representatives from November 1960 to January 1961.

==Biography ==
Miller was born in Portsmouth, Ohio in 1901. He earned his high school diploma from Portsmouth High School. In 1923, he earned a bachelor of arts degree from Ohio State University (Columbus, Ohio). In 1931, he was awarded a master of arts degree by Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts).

===Congress ===
On November 8, 1960, Miller won a special election to complete the term of Democratic U.S. Representative James G. Polk, who had died in office on April 28, 1959 (thus creating one of the longest vacancies in the U.S. Congress in modern times). Since Miller had not run for election to a full term in the 87th Congress, his membership in the House of Representatives ended on January 3, 1961.

===Death===
He died in Portsmouth in 1984.

<text>Igram van Achelen (1528 – 18 October 1604) was a Dutch statesman.

Van Achelen studied law in Deventer, Leiden and Leuven. In 1561 he married the niece of president Viglius van Aytta. In 1550 he was nominated member of the Frisian Regional Council by Charles V. In 1570 he became president of the Frisian State Council.

A memorial column from 1574 expresses the gratitude of the province for the construction of the dikes after the great floods of 1570. Later, when the Council announced a decree deseating Don John of Austria, he was suspected to take side for the latter. Van Achelen was incarcerated and released soon thereafter. He redeemed himself only eight years later, when he was awarded the knightly insignia. He became a member of the Privy Council of the Habsburg Netherlands, then on 18 August 1598 president of the Great Council of Mechelen.

<text>Tex Brashear (born January 2, 1955) is a voice actor, who after a career in radio in Texas, Arizona, and Los Angeles, made the transition into voice acting. Known as &quot;The Man of 1000 Voices&quot; (although he actually does more than 3000), Brashear has been heard in thousands of cartoons, radio and television commercials, and has narrated many nature and historical films. His voice has been heard in countless movie trailers through the years. His comedic singing has even been featured on &quot;The Doctor Demento Show&quot;. He has also voiced and produced comedy bits for &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Program&quot;. Winner of 102 Addy Awards, he is also credited with discovering and developing the technique of reverse breathing, a vocal technique used by voice actors to help sustain their long breaths. It is somewhat related to circular breathing. In addition to voice acting, he has also served as casting director and dialect coach for many films, both American and foreign, and has contributed many research papers on the history of the American Southwest.

<doc id="810658" wikidata="Q6893560" url="?curid=810658" title="Mohan Meakin">
<text>Mohan Meakin is a large group of companies which started with Asia&#x27;s first brewery incorporated in 1855 (but established much earlier) by Edward Dyer at Kasauli in the Himalayan Mountains in India under the name Dyer Breweries.

==History==
In the late 1840s, Edward Abraham Dyer, father of Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer (responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre), moved from England to set up the first brewery in India (later incorporated as Dyer Breweries in 1855) at Kasauli in the Himalayas. The Kasauli brewery launched India&#x27;s and indeed Asia&#x27;s first beer, Lion, which was in great demand by the thirsty British administrators and troops stationed in the sweltering heat of India. Lion was much appreciated as a beer, and one famous poster featured a satisfied British Tommy declaring, &quot;as good as back home!&quot;.

The brewery was soon moved to nearby Solan, close to the British summer capital Shimla, as there was an abundant supply of fresh springwater there. The Kasauli brewery site was converted to a distillery, which Mohan Meakin Ltd. still operates. Dyer set up more breweries at Shimla, Murree (Murree Brewery), Rawalpindi, Mandalay and Quetta and acquired interests in the Ootacamund Brewery (South India).

Another entrepreneur, H. G. Meakin, moved to India and in 1887 bought the old Shimla and Solan Breweries from Edward Dyer and added more at Ranikhet, Dalhousie, Chakrata, Darjeeling, Kirkee and Nuwara Eliya (Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon). After the First World War, the Meakin and Dyer breweries merged and, in 1937, when Burma was separated from India, the company was restructured with its Indian assets as Dyer Meakin Breweries, a public company on the London Stock Exchange.

Following independence, Narendra Nath Mohan raised funds and travelled to London, where he acquired a majority stake in Dyer Meakin Breweries. He took over management of the company in 1949 and built new breweries at Lucknow, Ghaziabad and Khopoli (near Mumbai) and the company name was changed to Mohan Meakin Breweries in 1967.

On the death of Mohan in 1969, his eldest son, V. R. Mohan, took over as managing director. He introduced a number of new products that are brand leaders today but died in 1973, soon after taking over. In the 1970s, the manufacturing activities of the company were diversified into other fields including breakfast cereals, fruit juices and mineral water under the leadership of Kapil Mohan (V. R. Mohan&#x27;s brother). The word &quot;brewery&quot; was dropped from the company name in 1982 to remove the impression that the company was engaged only in beer making. New breweries were built during the 1970s and 1980s at Chandigarh, Madras, Nepal and Kakinada near Hyderabad.

Today, Mohan Meakin&#x27;s principal brands are Old Monk Rum and Golden Eagle Beer. Its other products include Diplomat Deluxe, Colonel&#x27;s Special, Black Knight, Meakin 10,000, Summer Hall and Solan No 1 whiskies, London Dry and Big Ben gins, and Kaplanski vodka. Asia&#x27;s original beer, Lion, is still sold in northern India.

==Beer==
&quot;Lion Beer&quot; is the main brand first sold by Dyer Breweries in the 1840s. Lion was originally an India Pale Ale (IPA) but the beer style was changed in the 1960s to a lager. Lion remained the number one beer in India for over a century from the 1840s until the 1960s. After this, another Mohan Meakin brand, Golden Eagle, took the number one place until the 1980s, when Kingfisher became number one. By 2001, Lion sales had declined substantially and Lion was only available to the Indian Army through the Canteen Stores Department (CSD). Mohan Meakin then entrusted the marketing of its original beer to International Breweries Pvt. Ltd. The brand has since been relaunched in the north Indian market. With a new label design and marketing campaign, Lion has established itself once more in the civilian market and is now expanding into markets across India.

Lion earns a place in history as Asia&#x27;s first beer brand. Lion&#x27;s popularity with the British during the heyday of the empire led to the start-up of other Lion beers around the world, in New Zealand, South Africa and elsewhere. Lion remains the number-one brand in neighbouring Sri Lanka, where Mohan Meakin had introduced it in the 1880s through their Ceylon brewery.

Among their list of beers is Old Monk 1000, sporting the same logo as the Old Monk Rum considered as a strong beer with high alcohol content. 

==Rum==

Old Monk is a vatted Indian rum, blended and aged for 7 years (though there is also more expensive, 12-year-old version). It is dark, with an alcohol content of 42.8 (army issue alcohol content is 50%). It is produced by Mohan Meakin, based in Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.

It is available in all parts of India. Old Monk is also the third largest selling rum in the world. Old Monk has been the biggest Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) brand for many years. The first time it was tasted officially was 19 December 1954. It is sold in five size variants: 180 ml (quarter / nip), 350 ml (half / pint), 750 ml (full / quart), 1-litre and 2-litre bottles.

<text>The Marzilibahn, officially the Drahtseilbahn Marzili–Stadt Bern (&quot;Funicular Marzili–City of Bern&quot;) is a very short funicular in Bern, the capital of Switzerland. Its 105 meters of track lead from the &quot;Marzili&quot; neighbourhood to the &quot;Bundeshaus&quot;, the seat of the Swiss federal government and parliament, in the Old City of Bern.

==History==
The Marzilibahn was proposed by a committee of seven Bernese entrepreneurs, who received an 80-year operating license by the Swiss Federal Assembly on 13 December 1884. Construction began in March 1885 and was hastily completed to allow a start of operations on 19 July 1885, to coincide with the opening of the &quot;Eidgenössisches Schützenfest&quot;, the Swiss marksmen&#x27;s festival, in Bern. As originally built, the tracks had a length of and spanned a height difference of .

The cars were water-powered: a tank in the upper car was filled with up to of water from the city stream (&quot;Stadtbach&quot;). This car, being heavier, then pulled the other one up the slope, after which the water would be drained and the process repeated with the other car. Up to thirty persons could be transported upwards in this manner. The descent was controlled by an operator on the forward platform on the upper car, who communicated with his colleague in the lower car by means of bell signals.

The original green cars, built by the local machine company &quot;Pümpin &amp; Herzog&quot; (later part of Von Roll) were replaced in 1914 by a new set of cars on account of the Swiss national exhibition in Bern, and the official name of the funicular was changed from &quot;Drahtseilbahn Aarziele&quot; to &quot;Drahtseilbahn Marzili-Stadt Bern&quot;. Ticket prices ranged from 10 &quot;rappen&quot; at the time of the opening (the Federal Council had to forbid charging non-locals twice that much) to 30 rappen in 1973. The area around and below the raised steel tracks was a garden, cared for by the conductors.

In 1974, the line was converted to electric power, and a third generation of cars supplied. The two second generation cars are both preserved, one at the Swiss Museum of Transport in Lucerne and the other close to the lower station of the line.

==Technical parameters==
The funicular has the following parameters:


==Records==
The Marzilibahn is sometimes called the shortest funicular in Europe, but its operators are not certain about this, noting that similarly short funiculars exist in England and Hungary. The Zagreb Funicular in Croatia is at any rate shorter at 66 m.

==Operator==
The Marzilibahn is owned and operated by a private company, &quot;Drahtseilbahn Marzili-Stadt Bern AG&quot;, which employs ten part-time staff. Its shares are held mostly by railway enthusiasts. In 2009, the company turned a profit of 175,000 Swiss francs.

<doc id="810666" wikidata="Q208811" url="?curid=810666" title="Panathenaic Stadium">
<text>The Panathenaic Stadium (, ) or Kallimarmaro ( , ) is a multi-purpose stadium in Athens, Greece. One of the main historic attractions of Athens, it is the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble.

A stadium was built on the site of a simple racecourse by the Athenian statesman Lykourgos (Lycurgus) BC, primarily for the Panathenaic Games. It was rebuilt in marble by Herodes Atticus, an Athenian Roman senator, by 144 AD it had a capacity of 50,000 seats. After the rise of Christianity in the 4th century it was largely abandoned. The stadium was excavated in 1869 and hosted the Zappas Olympics in 1870 and 1875. After being refurbished, it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the first modern Olympics in 1896 and was the venue for 4 of the 9 contested sports. It was used for various purposes in the 20th century and was once again used as an Olympic venue in 2004. It is the finishing point for the annual Athens Classic Marathon. It is also the last venue in Greece from where the Olympic flame handover ceremony to the host nation takes place.

==Location==
The stadium is built in what was originally a natural ravine between the two hills of Agra and Ardettos, south of the Ilissos river. It is now located in the central Athens district of Pangrati, to the east of the National Gardens and the Zappeion Exhibition Hall, to the west of the Pangrati residential district, and between the twin pine-covered hills of Ardettos and Agra. Until the 1950s, the Ilissos River (which is now covered by (and flowing underneath) Vasileos Konstantinou Avenue) ran in front of the stadium&#x27;s entrance, with the spring of Kallirrhoe, the sanctuary of Pankrates (a local hero), and the Cynosarges public gymnasium nearby.

==History==
Originally, since the 6th century BC, a racecourse stood at the site. It hosted the Panathenaic Games (also known as the Great Panathenaea), a religious and athletic festival celebrated every four years in honour of the goddess Athena. The racecourse had no formal seating and the spectators sat on the natural slopes on the side of the ravine.

===Stadium of Lykourgos===
In the 4th century BC the Athenian statesman Lykourgos (Lycurgus) built an long stadium of poros stone. Tiers of stone benches were arranged around the track. The track was long and wide. In the &quot;Lives of the Ten Orators&quot; Pseudo-Plutarch writes that a certain Deinas, the owner of the property where the stadium was built was persuaded by Lykourgos to donate the land to the city and Lykourgos leveled a ravine. IG II² 351 (dated 329 BC), records that Eudemus of Plataea gave 1000 yoke of oxen for the construction of the stadium and theater. According to Romano the &quot;reference to the large number of oxen, indicating a vast undertaking, and the use of the word &quot;charadra&quot; have suggested the kind of building activity that would have been needed to prepare the natural valley between the two hills near the Ilissos.&quot; The stadium of Lykourgos is believed to have been completed for the Panathenaic Games of 330/329 BC. Donald Kyle suggests that it is possible that Lykourgos did not build but &quot;renovated or embellished a pre-existing facility to give it monumental stature.&quot; According to Richard Ernest Wycherley the stadium probably had stone seating &quot;only for a privileged few.&quot;

===Reconstruction by Herodes Atticus===

Herodes Atticus, an Athenian who rose to the highest echelons of power in Rome, was responsible for numerous structures in Greece. In Athens he is best known for the reconstruction of the Panathenaic Stadium. Tobin suggests that &quot;Herodes built the stadium soon after [his father] Atticus&#x27;s death, which occurred around A.D. 138. The first Greater Panathenaia following his father&#x27;s demise was 139/40, and it is probable that at that time Herodes promised the refurbishment of the stadium. According to Philostratus, it was completed four years later, which would have been in 143/4.&quot; These dates (139/140-143-144 AD) are now widely cited as construction dates of the stadium of Herodes Atticus. Welch writes that the stadium was completed by 143, in time for Panathenaic festival.
The new stadium was built completely of ashlar masonry in Pentelic marble, using minimal concrete. The stadium was built at a time of resurgence of Greek culture in the mid-2nd century. Although the stadium was a &quot;quintessentially Greek architectural type&quot;, it was &quot;Roman in scale&quot; with a massive capacity of 50,000, which is roughly the same as that of the Stadium of Domitian in Rome. Stadia of the Classical and Hellenistic periods were smaller. According to Welch there is a possibility that criminals were executed in the stadium, however, no evidence exists.

A marble throne from the &quot;prohedria&quot; (front row seating) of the stadium is kept in the British Museum. One side of the throne includes a relief showing an olive tree and a table on which rests set of wreaths and a Panathenaic amphora. The front leg is in the form of an owl. Ten similar thrones have been found around Athens.

Herodes Atticus built it as &quot;an architectural means of self-representation, and it did something analogous. The architecture of the building makes allusions to the Classical past while remaining unmistakably modern. It is Roman in scale, but it self-consciously rejects the distinguishingly Roman features of monumental facade and extensive vaulting.&quot; The seats of the cavea were decorated with owls in relief, which symbolize Athena. Katherine Welch wrote in a 1998 article &quot;Greek stadia and Roman spectacles&quot;:
===Abandonment===
After Hellenistic festivals and bloody spectacles were banned by Roman Emperor Theodosius I in the late 4th century, the stadium was abandoned and fell into ruin. Gradually, its significance was forgotten and a field of wheat covered the site. During the Latin rule of Athens, Crusader knights held feats of arms at the stadium. A 15th century traveler saw &quot;not only several rows of white marble benches, but also the portico at the entrance of the stadion, which he calls the north entrance, and the stoa round the koilon, which he calls the south entrance.&quot; The derelict stadium&#x27;s marbles were incorporated into other buildings. European travelers wrote of &quot;magical rites enacted by young Athenian maidens in the ruined vaulted passage, aimed at finding a good husband.&quot;

===Modern reconstruction===

====Excavations and Zappas Olympics====
Following Greece&#x27;s independence, archaeological excavation as early as 1836 uncovered traces of the stadium of Herodes Atticus. Further, more thorough, excavation was conducted by the German-born architect Ernst Ziller in 1869–70. Some marbles of the stadium and four Hermai were found. The Zappas Olympics, an early attempt to revive the ancient Olympic Games, were held at the stadium in 1870 and 1875. They were sponsored by the Greek benefactor Evangelis Zappas. The games had an audience of 30,000 people.

==== 1896 Olympics====
The Greek government, through crown prince Constantine, requested the Egypt-based Greek businessman George Averoff, to sponsor the second refurbishment of the stadium prior to the 1896 Olympics. Based on the findings of Ziller, a reconstruction plan was prepared by the architect Anastasios Metaxas in the mid-1890s. Darling writes that &quot;He duplicated the dimensions and design of the second-century structure, arranging the tiers of seats around the U-shaped track.&quot; It was rebuilt in Pentelic marble and is &quot;distinguished by its high degree of fidelity to the ancient monument of Herodes.&quot; Averoff donated 920,000 drachmas to this project. As a tribute to his generosity, a statue of Averoff was constructed and unveiled on 5 April 1896 outside the stadium. It stands there to this day.

The stadium held the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1896 Olympics. On 6 April (25 March according to the Julian calendar then in use in Greece), the games of the First Olympiad were officially opened; it was Easter Monday for both the Western and Eastern Christian Churches and the anniversary of Greece&#x27;s independence. The stadium was filled with an estimated 60,000 spectators, including King George I of Greece, his wife Olga, and their sons. Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organizing committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the games. The stadium also served as the venue for Athletics, Gymnastics, Weightlifting and Wrestling.

====1906 Intercalated Games====
The stadium hosted the 1906 Intercalated Games from 22 April to 2 May.

====Home of AEK Basketball Club====
From the mid- to late 1960s, the stadium was used by AEK Basketball Club. On 4 April 1968, the 1967–68 FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final was hosted in the stadium where AEK defeated Slavia VŠ Praha in front of around 70,000 seated spectators inside the arena and another 10,000 standing spectators near the entrance.

====Regime of the Colonels====
During the Regime of the Colonels (1967–74), large annual events were held at the stadium, particularly the &quot;Festival of the Military Virtues of the Greeks&quot; (in late August-early September) and the &quot;Revolution of 21 April 1967&quot;, the date of the coup that brought the right-wing regime to power. In these festivals, the stadium, &quot;with its aura of antiquity stood as a monument to Greek rebirth, national pride, and international interest.&quot; The dictators exploited its setting to showcase their supposed popularity and propagate their new, &quot;revolutionary&quot; political culture.

====2004 Olympics====
The stadium &quot;needed no major refurbishing&quot; prior to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. During the games the stadium hosted the archery competition (15–21 August) and was the finish of the Marathon for both women (22 August) and men (29 August).

====2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games====
The opening ceremony of the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games were held here which featured special appearances such as Stevie Wonder, Vanessa Williams and Zhang Ziyi. The games ran from 25 June to 5 July.

==Concert venue==
On occasion, the stadium has also been used as a venue for selected musical and dance performances.
* In April 1916 Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; was staged at the stadium.
* On 23–24 July 1985 the &quot;Rock in Athens&quot; Festival took place featuring singers and bands like Depeche Mode, The Stranglers, Culture Club, the Cure, Talk Talk, Nina Hagen, and the Clash.
* On 2 October 1988 the &quot;Live AID – Concert for AIDS&quot; was held in the stadium including artists like Bonnie Tyler, Joan Jett, Jerry Lee Lewis, Run–D.M.C. and Black Uhuru.
* On 5 October 2008, the stadium hosted the MTV Greece launch party, with guests R.E.M., Kaiser Chiefs, C：Real and Gabriella Cilmi.
* On 1 July 2009, Sakis Rouvas performed a sold-out concert in support of environmental issues before an audience of 50,000. it was the largest attendance ever at the stadium for a non-sporting event, and the largest attendance for a single musical artist in Greek history.
* On 16 July 2018, the Scorpions gave the &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; concert at the stadium.
* On 5 October 2024, Anna Vissi broke every previous record with a concert attended by 65,000 fans.
* On 2 October 2025, Robbie Williams will perform at the stadium as part of his Robbie Williams Live 2025 tour.

Other concerts include those of Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo (27 June 2007) and a dance performance by Joaquín Cortés (14 September 2009).

==Other events==
The stadium hosted the opening ceremony of the 1997 World Championships in Athletics on a concept by composer Vangelis and along with the performance of soprano Montserrat Caballé.

In more recent years, the stadium has been often used to honour the homecoming of victorious Greek athletes, most notably the Greece national football team after its victory at the UEFA Euro 2004 on 5 July 2004 as well as Greek medalists in recent Olympic Games.

The stadium was the venue for the Dior Cruise 2022 show. The collection drew inspiration from Ancient Greek art and Greek folk culture as well as Christian Dior&#x27;s Fall 1951 campaign photoshoot on the Acropolis. The show was attended by many A-listers, such as Anya Taylor-Joy, Cara Delevingne, Jisoo and many other global and Greek stars.

==Architecture==
Katherine Welch described the stadium as a &quot;great marble flight of steps terraced into the contours of a U-shaped ravine — splendid in materials but ostentatiously simple in construction technique.&quot;

===Influence===
The Panathenaic Stadium influenced the stadium architecture in the West in the 20th century. Harvard Stadium in Boston, built in 1903, was modeled after the Panathenaic Stadium. Designated as a National Historic Landmark, it is the first collegiate athletic stadium in the United States. Deutsches Stadion in Nuremberg, designed by Albert Speer, was also modeled on the Panathenaic Stadium. Speer was inspired by the stadium when he visited Athens in 1935. The stadium was designed for some 400,000 spectators and was one of the monumental structures of the Nazi regime. Its construction began in 1937, but was never completed.

==Commemorations==
The Panathenaic Stadium was selected as the main motif for a high value euro collectors&#x27; coin; the €100 Greek The Panathenaic Stadium commemorative coin, minted in 2003 to commemorate the 2004 Olympics. In the obverse of the coin, the stadium is depicted. It is shown on the obverse of all Olympic medals awarded in the 2004 Olympics, and it was also used for the succeeding Summer Olympics in Beijing in 2008, in London in 2012, in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, and in Tokyo in 2021.

<text>Walter Eugene Powell (April 25, 1931 – January 17, 2020) was an American educator and politician of the Republican party who served as a U.S. Representative from Ohio from 1971 to 1975.

==Life and career==
Powell was born in Hamilton, Ohio, the son of Anna and Walter Powell. Before entering politics, Powell was a history teacher.

He met his wife, Bobbi Mae, in the summer of 1951, as summer employees of LeSourdsville Lake. They married June 2, 1952.

He began his career as the city clerk of Fairfield, Ohio in 1956, and became a member of Fairfield City Council in 1958. In 1960, Powell successfully ran for the Ohio House of Representatives. He was reelected in 1962, and 1964.

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided Powell with incentive to run for the Ohio Senate, which he did. He ended up winning, and took a seat in the upper chamber on January 3, 1967. While he was up for reelection to the Senate in 1970, he instead initially opted to run for Ohio State Treasurer. However, he eventually entered the race for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. He went on to win the seat, and ultimately swapped seats with his predecessor, Buz Lukens, who then was appointed to Powell&#x27;s senate seat.

Powell went on to serve two terms in Congress, and opted to retire after his second term ended in 1975. He was succeeded by Tom Kindness.

==Retirement==
Following his tenure in Congress, he retired to Middletown, Ohio. He became a high school administrator, rising to the level of principal. He later changed careers, attending University of Cincinnati Law School and passing the bar exam at age 53. He worked for many years thereafter as a real estate, tax, and probate lawyer.

Powell died on January 17, 2020.

== History ==
JUDE development was started by Kenji Hiranabe, CEO of Change Vision, Inc., in 1996.

JUDE was provided as a free software in 1999. Five years later JUDE started selling in the Japanese market. This decision came about because some UML modeling tools existed overseas but they were a bit high priced; and the company would get feedback from Japanese users and could evolve more if JUDE was released on the market.

The number of JUDE users was 120,000 as of October 30, 2006. In September 2009, JUDE was renamed to Astah after receiving concerns from German users who pointed out the product name was similar to the German word &quot;Jude&quot;, which refers to a male Jew.

<doc id="810678" wikidata="Q458855" url="?curid=810678" title="Sivananda Saraswati">
<text>Swami Sivananda Saraswati (; 8 September 1887 – 14 July 1963), also called Swami Sivananda, was a yoga guru, a Hindu spiritual teacher, and a proponent of &quot;Vedanta&quot;. Sivananda was born in Pattamadai, in the Tirunelveli district of modern Tamil Nadu, and was named Kuppuswami. He studied medicine and served in British Malaya as a physician for several years before taking up monasticism.

He was the founder of the Divine Life Society (DLS) in 1936, Yoga-Vedanta Forest Academy (1948) and author of over 200 books on yoga, &quot;Vedanta&quot;, and a variety of subjects. He established Sivananda Ashram, the headquarters of the DLS, on the bank of the Ganges at Muni Ki Reti, from Rishikesh, and lived most of his life there.

Sivananda Yoga, the yoga form propagated by his disciple Vishnudevananda, is now spread in many parts of the world through Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres. These centres are not affiliated with Sivananda&#x27;s ashrams, which are run by the Divine Life Society.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

Swami Sivananda was born as Kuppuswami to a brahmin family on 8 September 1887. His birth took place during the early hours of the morning as the Bharani star was rising in Pattamadai village in Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu. His father, P.S. Vengu Iyer, worked as a revenue officer and was a devotee of Shiva. His mother, Parvati Ammal, was also religious. Kuppuswami was the third and last child of his parents.

As a child, he was very active and promising in academics and gymnastics. He attended medical school in Tanjore, where he excelled. He ran a medical journal called &quot;Ambrosia&quot; during this period. Upon graduation, he practiced medicine and worked as a doctor in British Malaya for ten years, with a reputation for providing free treatment to poor patients. Over time, a sense that medicine was healing on a superficial level grew in Dr. Kuppuswami, urging him to look elsewhere to fill the void, and in 1923 he left Malaya and returned to India to pursue his spiritual quest.

=== Initiation ===

Upon his return to India in 1924, he went to Rishikesh where he met his guru, Vishvananda Saraswati, who initiated him into the Sannyasa order, and gave him his monastic name. The full ceremony was conducted by Vishnudevananda, the mahant (abbot) of Sri Kailas Ashram. Sivananda settled in Rishikesh, and immersed himself in intense spiritual practices. Sivānanda performed austerities for many years while continuing to nurse the sick. In 1927, with some money from an insurance policy, he ran a charitable dispensary at Lakshman Jhula.


=== Founding the Divine Life Society ===
Sivananda founded the Divine Life Society in 1936 on the banks of the Ganges River, distributing spiritual literature for free. Early disciples included Satyananda Saraswati, founder of Satyananda Yoga.

In 1945, he created the Sivananda Ayurvedic Pharmacy, and organised the All-world Religions Federation. He established the All-world Sadhus Federation in 1947 and the Yoga-Vedanta Forest Academy in 1948. He called his yoga the &quot;Yoga of Synthesis&quot;, combining the Four Yogas of Hinduism (Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Rāja Yoga), for action, devotion, knowledge, and meditation respectively.

Sivananda travelled extensively on a major tour in 1950, and set up branches of the Divine Life Society throughout India. He vigorously promoted and disseminated his vision of yoga. His Belgian devotee André Van Lysebeth wrote that his critics &quot;disapproved of both his modern methods of diffusion, and his propagation of yoga on such a grand scale to the general public&quot;, explaining that Sivananda was advocating a practice that everybody could do, combining &quot;some asanas, a little pranayama, a little meditation and bhakti; well, a little of everything&quot;.

The 9th All-India Divine Life Convention was held at Venkatagiri on March 16, 1957, which was presided by Sathya Sai Baba and attended by Satchidananda Saraswati and Swami Sadananda. Following this Sathya Sai Baba visited Rishikesh. Materialising a rudrakasha mala with gold links, he presented it to the Sivananda. 

===Vegetarianism===
Sivananda insisted on a strict lacto-vegetarian diet for moral and spiritual reasons, arguing that &quot;meat-eating is highly deleterious to health&quot;. Divine Life Society thus advocates a vegetarian diet.

===Mahasamadhi===
Swami Sivananda died, described as entering Mahasamadhi, on 14 July 1963 beside the River Ganges at his Sivananda Ashram near Muni Ki Reti.

== Disciples ==
Sivananda&#x27;s two chief acting organizational disciples were Chidananda Saraswati and Krishnananda Saraswati. Chidananda Saraswati was appointed president of the DLS by Sivananda in 1963 and served in this capacity until his death in 2008. Krishnananda Saraswati was appointed General Secretary by Sivananda in 1958 and served in this capacity until his death in 2001.

<text>Ford Motor Company of New Zealand Limited is the New Zealand subsidiary of Ford. The Ford New Zealand assembly and distribution began in 1936, following the successful representation of Ford&#x27;s New Zealand business by The Colonial Motor Company (CMC). Ford New Zealand was based in Seaview, Wellington. A second assembly plant was opened in Wiri, Auckland in 1973. Seaview was closed in 1988 and Wiri in 1997. Since then, all of the Ford New Zealand product offerings have been fully imported.

==History==
The Ford Motor Company of Canada had been established in 1904, to build and to sell the Ford products to the territories that made up the British Empire, including New Zealand. This was a way to avoid the tariffs that existed upon American-made products imported into Empire states. In turn, Ford of Canada established privately owned agencies in those various Empire states to handle the business. In the early 1920s, because the Ford business around the world had now become so large, the Ford directors concluded that leaving the assembly and distribution of their products to other than Ford-owned interests posed a quality-control risk. Ford of Canada acted first in South Africa, where their appointed agent had not been following Ford guidelines, and an assembly plant and head office was set up in Port Elizabeth. Then they looked to Australia, where it was decided the agency operation was not in Ford&#x27;s best interests, and an assembly and a manufacturing operation was set up in Geelong and opened in 1925. But, so satisfied with the CMC performance in its New Zealand territory that it was not until 1936 that Ford of Canada set up in New Zealand. It was the last of their overseas territories to be taken over, and Ford&#x27;s relationship with CMC continued as that organisation retained and further developed retail Ford outlets. The Ford and CMC relationship has survived to this day, and it makes CMC owned Ford dealerships amongst the oldest in the world.

Choosing Wellington as the location for the huge new assembly plant made sense. Wellington is the capital, the centre of government and the base for most national and international corporations. The prerequisite port was well developed and good rail and road connections gave good access to and from all parts of the country. A new industrial area was being established in the Hutt Valley and there was abundant space there for expansion. Low-cost housing was being built in the new suburbs nearby to house the workforce.

The building Ford erected was of exceptional significance in New Zealand. The &quot;daylight factory&quot; design had evolved over the past 20 years, and it made extensive use of glass for natural light and ventilation. No longer were Ford&#x27;s plants high rise - they were built on one level, so as to make use of Ford&#x27;s highly-efficient moving assembly line methods of assembly. The neo-classical façade facing Seaview Road also typical of Ford&#x27;s worldwide image - this highly-attractive frontage and well-tended gardens hid the functional role of the building. There was no mistaking who occupied the impressive new building - the largest neon sign in the southern hemisphere was mounted on the roof, facing Seaview Road and out over the harbour towards Wellington city, from where it was visible!

Production began in October, 1936 before the building was completed. The first cars built were the current 1936 Model 68 V8, which arrived CBD (completely broken-down) in wooden crates shipped from Ford of Canada. These were joined soon after by the British-sourced 10-HP Model C and the 8-HP Model Y. Whilst next years models were released in America in September each year, there was always a lag before they arrived on roads overseas. For instance, it was not until July, 1937 that the 1937 Model 78 V8 was released in New Zealand. In September, 1937 the British Model C was replaced by the Ford Ten 7W, a revised version of which was known as the E93A, released in New Zealand in March, 1939. This was the first car that Ford gave a name to - it was the Prefect. Similarly, when it was released in Britain in January, 1940 after the outbreak of World War Two, the revised Ford Eight had given the very patriotic name of Anglia - the first Anglias were sold in New Zealand in July, 1940.
On the outbreak of war production shifted solely to military work and, during World War II, Ford New Zealand produced 10,423 vehicles including Bren Gun Carriers as well as 5.7 million hand grenades and 1.2 million mortar rounds. Civilian car production resumed in 1946 which was also the year assembly of the Fordson tractor was introduced in New Zealand. In 1965 a parts depot opened in Auckland leading the transfer of operations from Wellington to Auckland and in 1972 a transmission and chassis manufacturing facility at Wiri, Manukau City. The Auckland assembly plant was also completed in 1972 and began building Falcons the next year. In 1981 an alloy wheel plant was opened at Wiri. By 1987 most operations had been moved from Seaview to Wiri, Auckland and the Seaview plant was closed in 1988 after 52 years. Ford New Zealand underwent a major restructuring in 1987–88, including relocation of all operations to Wiri.

Products made by Ford New Zealand up from the early 1950s until the 1980s (with exception of the Falcon/Fairmont range, and low volume American product until the 1960s) were predominantly British. Generations of New Zealanders grew up with Anglias, Escorts, Cortinas, Zephyrs and Zodiacs just as New Zealand&#x27;s immediately preceding generation grew up with Canadian sourced (for Imperial Preference tariffs) but locally assembled Model Ts, Model As and Ford V8s. All were successful. Falcons from Australia were very popular running a close second to Holden right through from the 1960s to the 1980s.

In common with other countries in the Asia Pacific region, Ford New Zealand marketed the Mazda-based Laser and Telstar, which replaced the British Escort and Cortina in the early 1980s. Unlike Australia, however, the Sierra was assembled and sold locally in New Zealand in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, though generally only available as a wagon.

A wagon version of the Telstar was eventually offered in New Zealand, based on Mazda&#x27;s GV platform – in fact New Zealand was the only country outside Japan where this body style was available. It continued to be marketed locally, along with a sedan version called the Telstar Orion, until 1997.

This sharing of models between Ford and Mazda led to the formation of Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ), a joint venture in which Ford New Zealand held a 74 percent shareholding. This had followed the closure of Mazda&#x27;s own assembly plant in Ōtāhuhu in 1987. The Mazda 323 and 626, were assembled alongside the almost identical Ford Laser and Telstar until well into the 1990s. This was in contrast to Australia, where Mazdas were not assembled locally. Ford Australia switched to importing those models from Japan with the closure of its plant in Homebush West, Sydney.

However, free-market reforms in New Zealand in the late 1980s saw the lowering of import tariffs and a flood of used imports from Japan. Many of these were mechanically identical Mazda Capellas (as the 626 was known in Japan), as well as Ford Telstars and Mondeos. In addition, Australian-built Fords like the Falcon, and its General Motors rival, the Holden Commodore, could now be imported New Zealand duty-free.

With the demise of local car assembly looking inevitable, VANZ announced it would cease operations in 1997. The alloy wheel plant was sold in 2001. Ford Australia ended manufacture in October 2016.

<doc id="810683" wikidata="Q16017411" url="?curid=810683" title="John W. Griffin (politician)">
<text>John William Griffin (June 9, 1927 – March 23, 2006) was an Ohio farmer and a perennial candidate for various local, state, and federal offices in Ohio. While he lost far more political races than he won, at the time of his death he was a duly-elected member of the Ohio State Board of Education. A resident of Miami Township in south central Montgomery County, Ohio between Miamisburg and Germantown, he irritated party and education officials with his bids for office and had been the subject of scathing articles in the Dayton press.

Griffin was the son of Francis and Genevieve (Stenger) Griffin. He graduated from Jefferson Township High School and attended the University of Dayton. Griffin was a Catholic and a member of the Knights of Columbus.

Griffin won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Representative from Ohio&#x27;s Eighth Congressional District in 1976, 1980, and 1982, each time losing to Republican incumbent Tom Kindness. In 1978, Griffin ran for Congress again, winning the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Republican Tennyson Guyer in the Fourth District. He was again unsuccessful.

Griffin ran again in the Eighth District in 1986 and 1988, both times losing to Kindness&#x27;s successor Donald &quot;Buz&quot; Lukens. (Rather than seek re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Kindness had sought election to the U.S. Senate in 1986.) In 1998, Griffin again won the Democratic nomination in the Eighth District, defeating the Democratic party&#x27;s endorsed candidate, but lost in the general election to Lukens&#x27;s successor John Boehner. He sought the Democratic nomination in 2000 to challenge Boehner again, but lost the primary to John G. Parks – 15,924 (53 percent) for Parks, 14,126 (47 percent) for Griffin.

In 1976, Griffin ran as an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention, pledged to U.S. Rep. Morris K. Udall (D-Arizona) for President. Griffin was an elected member of the Ohio Democratic Party&#x27;s State Central Committee for two decades, losing his seat in the mid-1990s. He unsuccessfully sought re-election to the committee in 1998 and 2000.

In 1990, he ran simultaneously for the Ohio House of Representatives from the 73rd district and the Ohio State Board of Education from the Eighth District, losing both races. Griffin was elected in 1992 to the Ohio State Board of Education, defeating three-term incumbent Chester A. Roush in the Third District for a two-year term. Griffin finished second to Diana M. Fessler in a six-candidate field in 1994 when he ran for a full four-year term. He moved to Minster, in northern Ohio, in 1996 to run against Virginia E. Jacobs for the First District seat on the Ohio State Board of Education and lost. In 1997, 1999, and 2001, he ran for the Board of Education of the Miamisburg City School District in Montgomery County and came in last all three times. In 2001, he was last in a field of six, receiving 993 votes (9.135%). In 1998, he again ran against Fessler in the Third District and again lost. Griffin campaigned against school vouchers and for reform of school funding in Ohio.

In 2002, Griffin again sought a seat on the State Board of Education. &quot;The Dayton Daily News&quot; that year ran a series of scathing pieces about Griffin&#x27;s behavior during his first term on the state board and his tax problems. Dennis Lieberman, chairman of the Montgomery County Democratic Party, stated &quot;He has constantly been an embarrassment to our whole community.&quot; Nevertheless, Griffin unseated Third District incumbent Carl Wick to return to the State Board of Education. Immediately after the election, party leaders in Dayton vowed they would try to remove him from office and the &quot;Daily News&quot; ran more scathing opinions – one writer called him a &quot;rat&quot; – but Griffin served on the board until his death. &quot;I am so disillusioned with our electorate,&quot; Lieberman said after Griffin&#x27;s election.

Griffin died at Middletown Regional Hospital in Middletown, Ohio at age 78. &quot;He was an advocate for children, and his work on the state board of education reflected his desire to see all Ohio students succeed in the classroom,&quot; said J.C. Benton of the Ohio Department of Education upon the occasion of Griffin&#x27;s death.

<doc id="810686" wikidata="Q2422104" url="?curid=810686" title="Thomas L. Ashley">
<text>Thomas William Ludlow &quot;Lud&quot; Ashley (January 11, 1923 – June 15, 2010) was an American businessman and politician of the Democratic Party. He served as a U.S. representative from Ohio from 1955 to 1981.

==Early life and education==
Ashley was born on January 11, 1923, in Toledo, Ohio, and raised in the Old West End. He was the son of Mary Alida Gouverneur (née Ludlow) Ashley and William Meredith Ashley, who owned a small steel manufacturing firm. His older brother William was killed in May 1944, at age 22, when his Army bomber exploded during a training mission over Massachusetts.

Ashley attended Maumee Valley Country Day School and graduated from the Kent School in Connecticut in 1942. During World War II, he served in the United States Army as a corporal in the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, Ashley attended Yale University, where he graduated in 1948. At Yale, he was a member of the secret society Skull and Bones along with future U.S. President George H. W. Bush.

After graduating from Yale, Ashley worked with the Toledo Publicity and Efficiency Commission. Encouraged by Michael DiSalle, then mayor of Toledo and later governor of Ohio, he began studying law through night classes at the University of Toledo College of Law. He graduated from Ohio State University College of Law in 1951. He was admitted to the bar that year and began practicing law.

== Career ==
Ashley joined the staff of Radio Free Europe (RFE) in 1952. He served in Europe for RFE as the co-director of the press section and later the assistant director of special projects. He resigned from RFE on March 1, 1954, to run for Congress.

===U.S. Congress===
Ashley was elected to Congress in 1954, beating the incumbent Frazier Reams, an independent, by 4,000 votes in a three-way race. He served 13 terms in Congress and was chairman of the Select Committee on Energy (Ad Hoc) from 1977 to 1979 and of the United States House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries from 1979 to 1981.

In 1961, Ashley was one of six congressmen who voted to withdraw funding for the House Un-American Activities Committee. He helped pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act and was a proponent of anti-poverty and housing legislation.

In 1980, Ashley lost in an upset to Republican challenger Ed Weber.

===Later career===
Ashley was a member of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum board and served on many corporate boards, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the country&#x27;s two largest mortgage lenders.

==Personal life==
Ashley was twice married. He married Margaret Mary Sherman in 1956 and had a daughter but they separated and divorced quickly thereafter. He married Kathleen Lucey in 1967 at the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption in Trenton, New Jersey. Kathleen, the daughter of Charley Lucey (editor of &quot;The Times Newspapers&quot; in Trenton), was a graduate of Trinity College and Georgetown Law School and the Washington editor for the United States Savings and Loan League. They had two children:

* William Meredith Ashley, who married Monica Ann Manginello in 2008.
* Mark Michael Ashley

Kathleen Ashley died of heart failure at George Washington University Hospital in 1997. Lud Ashley lived in Leland, Michigan, until his death from melanoma at his home on June 15, 2010. After his death, George H. W. Bush said in a statement that he and Barbara Bush &quot;mourn the loss of a very close friend&quot; and said Ashley &quot;might well have been my very best friend in life.&quot;

Ashley was the great-great-grandson of James Mitchell Ashley, who was a U.S. Representative from Ohio from 1859 to 1869, and was one of the main architects of the Thirteenth Amendment.

<text>Edward Ford Weber (July 26, 1931 – February 27, 2023) was an American politician from Ohio. He served one term in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican from 1981 to 1983.

== Early life and education ==
Weber was born in Toledo, Ohio. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Denison University and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School. After graduation, Weber served two years in the United States Army.

== Career ==
After his discharge in 1958, Weber began to practice law. In 1966, the University of Toledo College of Law hired him as a professor.

In 1980, Weber ran for Ohio&#x27;s 9th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He defeated 26-year incumbent Thomas L. Ashley, chairman of the United States House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. This was due largely to Ronald Reagan carrying Lucas County, home to Toledo. In 1982, he lost his reelection bid to Marcy Kaptur.

<text>Robert Winthrop Ginty (November 14, 1948 – September 21, 2009) was an American actor, producer, screenwriter, and director. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Ginty took interest in the arts at a young age and went on to study acting at Yale University. Ginty worked in theatre until he moved to Hollywood in the mid-1970s. He started to play supporting roles on television and films, most notably a recurring role on the series &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; and two Hal Ashby films: &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976) and &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1978). Ginty became an action film lead with his breakthrough role in James Glickenhaus&#x27;s vigilante film &quot;The Exterminator&quot; (1980), which became a box-office success.

Up to the early 1990s Ginty acted in action oriented films such as &quot;The Act&quot; (1982), &quot;White Fire&quot; (1985), &quot;Mission Kill&quot; (1986), &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; (1987), &quot;Out On Bail&quot; (1989). He also directed and starred in &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot; (1989), &quot;Vietnam, Texas&quot; (1990) and &quot;Lady Dragon&quot; (1992). In the 1990s, Ginty focused on directing episodic television, including &quot;China Beach&quot; (1988), &quot;&quot; (1995), &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996), &quot;Charmed&quot; (1998), &quot;Tracker&quot; (2001), etc.

In the last decade of his life, Ginty, who died in 2009, became a theatre director and an artist in residence at Harvard University.

==Early life==
Ginty was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Elsie M. (née O&#x27;Hara), a government worker, and Michael Joseph Ginty, a construction worker. Ginty was involved with music from an early age, playing drums with Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Carlos Santana and John Lee Hooker. He studied at Yale and trained at the Neighborhood Playhouse and the Actors Studio. Ginty worked in the regional theater circuit, and New York theatre on Broadway. Harold Prince hired him as his assistant after seeing him perform in The New Hampshire Shakespeare Festival Summerstock Company under the direction of Jon Ogden in 1973.

== Career ==

=== Mid 1970s to 1980: early roles to breakthrough ===
Ginty moved to California in the 1970s, where he found frequent work in various series in the mid-1970s.

In 1974, Ginty acted in &quot;And Baby Makes Three.&quot;

In 1976, Ginty acted in Larry Peerce&#x27;s &quot;Two-Minute Warning&quot;, and Hal Ashby&#x27;s &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;.

That year on television, he appeared in the NBC television movie &quot;John O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Gibbsville&quot; (also known as &quot;The Turning Point of Jim Malloy&quot;). He attained some popularity after finding a steady role starring with Robert Conrad in &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;, a successful television series about the experiences of United States Marine Corps aviator Pappy Boyington and his squadron of misfits during World War II.

In 1978, Ginty worked again with director Ashby, in a supporting role in &quot;Coming Home&quot; starring Jane Fonda, Jon Voight, and Bruce Dern (a film which was nominated for eight Oscars). That year, he also appeared in John Llewellyn Moxey&#x27;s television film &quot;The Courage and the Passion&quot;.

Around the time he had a recurring role in the series &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; (1978).

In 1980, Ginty starred in James Glickenhaus&#x27;s vigilante film &quot;The Exterminator.&quot; The film is about two Vietnam veterans played by Steve James and Ginty, who live in the Bronx. James&#x27;s character is attacked and paralyzed by a street gang, which turns Ginty&#x27;s character into a vigilante. The film was a success grossing $35 million at the box office launching Ginty&#x27;s career as an action film leading man.

That year on television, he acted in &quot;To Your Health&quot; an episode of &quot;CHiPs&quot;, and &quot;The Accident&quot; an episode of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;.

=== 1981 to 1989: Action film leading man, subsequent roles, and directorial debut ===
Moving forward, Ginty had the lead in many action movies including &quot;The Act&quot; (1982), &quot;White Fire&quot; (1984), &quot;Mission Kill&quot; (1986), &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; (1987), &quot;Three Kinds of Heat&quot; (1987), &quot;Out On Bail&quot; (1989), &quot;Codename: Vengence&quot; (1989), etc.

In 1984, he reprised his role in the sequel &quot;Exterminator 2&quot;. However the production was troubled, and the film was significantly re-shot and re-edited. The film didn&#x27;t get good reviews.

During the 1980s he was a lead in the television series &quot;Hawaiian Heat. He also had&quot; recurring role in &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, and &quot;Falcon Crest.&quot;

In 1989, Ginty starred and directed &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot;. Also that year he acted in Joan Micklin Silver&#x27;s &quot;Loverboy&quot;.

=== 1990 to 2009: Subsequent roles, directing for television, theatre and university work ===
In 1990, Ginty starred and directed in &quot;Vietnam, Texas&quot;. He also acted in Tom Ropelewski&#x27;s comedy &quot;Madhouse&quot;.

In 1990, he appeared in &quot;The Reasonable Doubt Mystery&quot; an episode of &quot;The Father Dowling Mysteries&quot;.

In 1991, Ginty acted in Simon Wincer&#x27;s &quot;Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man&quot;.

Within his career, he became an independent producer/director, and formed his own production company, Ginty Films, buying shares in the special effects studio Introvision which distributed his vehicles both in the United States and abroad. Most were made on very limited budgets, but he had nevertheless done quite well for himself as a writer/producer/director, especially overseas, with such assembly-line fare as &quot;Gold Raiders&quot; (1983) which was filmed in Thailand, &quot;Cop Target&quot; (1990) which was shot in France, and &quot;Woman of Desire&quot; (1993).

Ginty continued in the late 1990s, performing, producing, and directing on such shows as &quot;China Beach&quot; (1988), &quot;&quot; (1995), &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996), &quot;Charmed&quot; (1998) and &quot;Tracker&quot; (2001).

In the last years of his life Ginty was a theatre director in Canada, France, Ireland and Italy. Furthermore, he was an artist in residence at Harvard University.

== Death ==
Ginty died of cancer in 2009 in Los Angeles, aged 60.

== Personal ==
Ginty resided, variously, in Los Angeles, Dublin, Toronto, and Vancouver. He was married to actress and former co-star Francine Tacker; they had a son, actor James Francis Ginty.

Ginty had also been married to actress Lorna Patterson. Both Tacker and Patterson would work together in the short-lived situation comedy &quot;Goodtime Girls&quot;.

Ginty married Michelle Craske in 2003, they remained together until Ginty&#x27;s death in 2009.

He began working with Narconon, a Scientology organization which provides drug rehabilitation, drug education and drug prevention programs, in 1979.

<doc id="810708" wikidata="Q3042763" url="?curid=810708" title="Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights">
<text>The Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (known also as the Barcelona Declaration) is a document signed by the International PEN Club, and several non-governmental organizations in 1996 to support linguistic rights, especially those of endangered languages. The document was adopted at the conclusion of the World Conference on Linguistic Rights held 6–9 June 1996 in Barcelona, Spain. It was also presented to the UNESCO Director General in 1996 but the Declaration has not gained formal approval from UNESCO.

==History==

===Precursors===

Although the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) has language as one of its categories for equal rights, it does not explicitly list and elaborate on linguistic rights. Even with declarations and rules on protecting specific languages and their rights, there was no binding document at that time that referred to all the languages or to world linguistic rights. As such, there have been attempts to fill this gap by expanding on the importance of linguistic rights in the global scene.

In addition, the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (UDLR) holds regards to several policies that motivated the respect of linguistic rights. Some of the documents include:
* Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities
* European Convention on Human Rights
* European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
* Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities
* International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
* Universal Declaration of the Collective Rights of Peoples

The idea of a Declaration was first proposed in 1984, where a Brazilian by the name of Francisco Gomes de Matos introduced to the International Federation of Modern Language Teachers (FIPLV), a plea for a Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights. He listed some of the principal linguistic rights, together with their educational implications.

One of the most significant motivations stemmed from the 12th Seminar of the International Association for the Development of Intercultural Communication of 1987, held in Recife, Brazil, which also recommended the introduction of a declaration for linguistic rights. The Seminar then adopted a preliminary declaration that indexed some fundamental types of linguistic rights.

===Drafting===

The main objective of penning a Declaration was to define equality in linguistic rights, regardless of differences in political or territorial statuses. It serves to promote international commitment in respecting the rights of linguistic groups, especially those of historicity, as well as individuals who do not reside within their native communities.

As such, the UDLR does not distinguish among official, non-official, majority, local, regional, and minority languages. There was much complexity tied to the drafting process because it was not easy to come up with equal measures, definitions and reasons, especially since it required an international consensus. For instance, one of the most common problems lie in clarifying concepts and their terminologies. Subsequently, follow-up meetings and feedback sessions were held in Paris, Portugal and Frankfurt.

In 1990, the FIPLV drafted a working document. In August 1991, the FIPLV organised a workshop in Pécs, Hungary. It was there that they managed to consolidate an agenda on fundamental principles for a UDLR. The Declaration was also discussed in December 1993, during a session of the Translations and Linguistic Rights Commission of the International PEN.

At the beginning of 1994, a team was rooted to facilitate the process of writing the official document. About 40 experts from different countries and fields were involved in the first 12 drafts of the Declaration. Progressively, there were continuous efforts in revising and improving the Declaration as people contributed ideas to be included in it.

===Adoption===

It was on 6 June 1996, during the World Conference on Linguistic Rights in Barcelona, Spain, that the Declaration was acknowledged. The Conference, which was an initiative of the Translations and Linguistic Rights Commission of the International PEN Club and the CIEMEN (Escarre International Center for Ethnic Minorities and the Nations), comprised 61 NGOs, 41 PEN Centers and 40 experts. The document was signed and presented to a representative of the UNESCO Director General. However, this does not mean that the Declaration has gained approval.

In the same year, the Declaration was published in Catalan, English, French and Spanish. It was later translated into other languages, some of which include Galician, Basque, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Nynorsk, Sardinian.

Even so, there have been continuous efforts to bring the Declaration through as UNESCO did not officially endorse the UDLR at its General Conference in 1996, and also in subsequent years, although they morally supported it.

As a result, a Follow-up Committee of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (FCUDLR) was created by the World Conference on Linguistic Rights. The FCUDLR is also represented by the CIEMEN, which is a non-profit and non-government organisation. The main objectives of having a follow-up committee was to 1) garner support, especially from international bodies, so as to lend weight to the Declaration and see it through to UNESCO, 2) to maintain contact with UNESCO and take into account the many viewpoints of its delegates, and 3) to spread awareness of the UDLR and establish a web of support.

Consequently, the committee started a Scientific Council consisting of professionals in Linguistic Law. The duty of the council is to update and improve the Declaration from time to time by gathering suggestions from those who are keen on the issue of linguistic rights.

The following summarises the progress of the UDLR:

==Contents and Themes==
===Structure===
The preamble of the Declaration provides six reasons underlying the motivations to promote the stated principles.

To ensure clarity in applicability across diverse linguistic environments, the declaration has included a preliminary title that addresses the definitions of concepts used in its articles (Articles 1–6). Title One (Articles 7–14) lists general principles asserting equal linguistic rights for language communities and for the individual. Besides the main principles, the second title delves into an overall linguistic régime and is further divided into 6 sections. Section 1 (Articles 15–22) addresses language usage related to public administration and official bodies. Section 2 (Articles 23–30) touches on linguistic rights involving educational fields. 
Section 3 (Articles 31–34) defines linguistic rights concerning naming, while Section 4 (Articles 35–40) asserts the entitlement of language groups to mass media resources and new technologies. Section 5 (Articles 41–46) outlines the rights related to cultural artifacts. The last section of the second title, Section 6 (Article 47–52), touches on the individual or language group&#x27;s rights in the socioeconomic sphere.

The Additional Dispositions call for the obligation of public powers to take measures ensuring the application of these rights and to inform other related bodies of these proclamations. As for the Final Dispositions, the founding of a Council of the Languages within the United Nations Organization is put forth, as well as the creation of a World Commission for Linguistic Rights, which is to be an unofficial, consultative council composed of experts in non-governmental organizations and those in the field of linguistic law.

===Opening Article===
==Reactions==

One of the comments made was on the idealistic nature of the Declaration. As the Declaration considers all languages equal, it rejects terms such as &#x27;official&#x27;, &#x27;regional&#x27; or &#x27;minority&#x27; languages and strongly advocates the full use of all historic community languages.

Drawing from the articles pertaining to the educational issues (Articles 25, 26 and 30), it is stated that the education system should fully support the development of their community languages and other languages they wish to know in schools to the point of fluency and capability to use it in all social situations. In addition, research on language and culture of language communities is to be done at the university level. It has been argued that the &#x27;rights&#x27; stated in those articles will remain the privilege of powerful language communities. The reason is that since the Declaration requires authorities to issue sanctions in the event of violation of the proclaimed rights, doubts have arisen regarding the likelihood of any government adopting the document. Many governmental groups (other than the regional authorities in Spain such as Catalonia, Menorca and Basque) in most countries find it hard to reconcile these fundamental principles of the Declaration with their current language policies and practices.
There is a need to balance between regulations imposed by governments and the protection of the rights of the people in different language communities. Considerations such as acknowledging the primary human rights of minority peoples (e.g. issues of physical survival) are, instead, regarded as more dire than an issue like linguistic rights. Linguistic rights will hence be ignored before primary human rights can be properly attended to. Furthermore, the cost involved in executing sanctions is another cause of concern. The main issue, however, is the fact that the article is not legally binding and duty-holders are never specified.

Other responses include the issue that more rights are given to &#x27;language communities&#x27; in the Declaration. In the context of education, it is observed that other than language communities (equivalent to &#x27;national territorially based minorities&#x27;), those who do not fit under this category will have to &#x27;assimilate&#x27;, as having the right to education in the language of the territory does not necessarily equate to having the right to an education in one&#x27;s own language.

==Developments==

===Efforts in Ratification===

The Declaration is not constitutional and has not been ratified by the UN General Assembly, unlike the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Despite the Follow-up Committee&#x27;s publication of the text in 1998, which was backed by letters of support from world leaders, UNESCO has not ratified the document. On 19 April 2002, CIEMEN and International PEN convoked a summit during the World Congress on Language Policies in Barcelona. The FIPLV suggested that it would modify the Declaration so that it would be accepted and implemented. There were also further efforts to foster support for the UDLR through proposals and conferences in 2003.

Since 2008, CIEMEN has been lobbying to place linguistic rights on the agenda of the states that are currently members of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Despite the positive responses to the document, member states perceived a lack of consensus on the matter and did not wish to be among the first to adopt the proposal. An event organised in Geneva in 2008, entitled &quot;Linguistic Rights to enhance Human Rights&quot;, which coincided with the Eighth Session of the UNHRC, aimed to garner support for a draft resolution for the UDLR to be presented at the September session of the UNHRC conference. Ambassadors from Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Armenia and Nigeria expressed their support in a series of interviews. Later in September, the Advisory Committee of the UNHRC was called upon to take steps to present a proposal, in hopes that the UDLR could be added to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

===Girona Manifesto===
The Girona Manifesto was developed by International PEN&#x27;s Translation and Linguistic Rights in May 2011 to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the Declaration. The Girona Manifesto is an updated version that condenses the primary principles of the UDLR to aid its implementation. In September 2011, the manifesto was ratified by the International PEN Assembly of Delegates at the 77th Congress.

The content of the manifesto is based on the Universal Declaration&#x27;s 10 central principles. In contrast to the comprehensive and complex declaration which plays an important role in the field of linguistics and politics, the manifesto is laid out in a concise and practical way, intended to be &#x27;translated and disseminated as a tool to defend linguistic diversity around the world&#x27;. The goal is to bring attention to the issue of language rights back to the international agenda.

It is thought to be an important step toward protecting and promoting all of the world&#x27;s languages, including the ones at risk of extinction. As John Ralston Saul, President of International PEN, mentioned, &quot;[It] could give us a clear public document with which to defend and advance languages with smaller populations as well as endangered languages&quot;.

On 5 March 2012, the Girona Manifesto and its translated versions were presented at an event organized by Catalan PEN Centre. It was held at the Palau de la Generalitat, Barcelona. The manifesto has been translated in 32 languages to date.

====Text of the Girona Manifesto on Linguistic Rights====
# Linguistic diversity is a world heritage that must be valued and protected.
# Respect for all languages and cultures is fundamental to the process of constructing and maintaining dialogue and peace in the world.
# All individuals learn to speak in the heart of a community that gives them life, language, culture and identity.
# Different languages and different ways of speaking are not only means of communication; they are also the milieu in which humans grow and cultures are built.
# Every linguistic community has the right for its language to be used as an official language in its territory.
# School instruction must contribute to the prestige of the language spoken by the linguistic community of the territory.
# It is desirable for citizens to have a general knowledge of various languages, because it favours empathy and intellectual openness, and contributes to a deeper knowledge of one&#x27;s own tongue.
# The translation of texts, especially the great works of various cultures, represents a very important element in the necessary process of greater understanding and respect among human beings.
# The media is a privileged loudspeaker for making linguistic diversity work and for competently and rigorously increasing its prestige.
# The right to use and protect one&#x27;s own language must be recognized by the United Nations as one of the fundamental human rights.

===Donostia Protocol===

In 2016, a group of NGOs including some UDLR initiators has adopted Donostia Protocol to Ensure Language Rights, which refers to UDLR as a source of inspiration.

==Supporters==

To date, the UDLR has received the support of many international personalities, some of whom have included: Nelson Mandela, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, Ronald Harwood, Homero Aridjis, Noam Chomsky, José Ramos-Horta, Dalai Lama, Dr. M. Aram, Desmond Tutu, László Tőkés, Ricardo María Carles Gordó, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, José Carreras, Seamus Heaney, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, Shimon Peres, Judit Mascó, Peter Gabriel, Jennifer Clement and Joan Oró.

<doc id="810710" wikidata="Q1568611" url="?curid=810710" title="Thomas Kinsella">
<text>Thomas Kinsella (4 May 1928 – 22 December 2021) was an Irish poet, translator, editor, and publisher. Born outside Dublin, Kinsella attended University College Dublin before entering the civil service. He began publishing poetry in the early 1950s and, around the same time, translated early Irish poetry into English. In the 1960s, he moved to the United States to teach English at universities including Temple University. Kinsella continued to publish steadily until the 2010s.

==Early life and work==
Thomas Kinsella was born on 4 May 1928 in Inchicore to working-class but &quot;cultured&quot; parents John Paul Kinsella and Agnes, née Casserly. His father and grandfather both worked in Guinness&#x27;s brewery, his father, a union organiser, in the cooperage, later working as &quot;a helper, a labourer, on a Guinness delivery lorry&quot;; his grandfather ran a barge from the brewery to sea-going vessels in Dublin harbour. Kinsella spent most of his childhood in the Kilmainham/ Inchicore area of Dublin, and was educated at the Model School, Inchicore, where classes were taught in the Irish language, and at the O&#x27;Connell Schools in North Richmond Street, Dublin. He entered University College Dublin in 1946, initially to study science. After a few terms in college, he took a post in the Irish civil service in the department of finance and continued his university studies at night, having switched to humanities and arts.

Many of Kinsella&#x27;s early poems were published in the University College Dublin magazine &quot;National Student&quot; from 1951 to 1953. His first pamphlet, &quot;The Starlit Eye&quot; (1952), was published by Liam Miller&#x27;s Dolmen Press, as was &quot;Poems&quot; (1956), his first book-length publication. These were followed by &quot;Another September&quot; (1958–1962), &quot;Moralities&quot; (1960), &quot;Downstream&quot; (1962), &quot;Wormwood&quot; (1966), and the long poem &quot;Nightwalker&quot; (1967).

==Translations and editing==
At Miller&#x27;s suggestion, Kinsella turned his attention to the translation of early Irish texts. He produced versions of &quot;Longes Mac Usnig&quot; and &quot;The Breastplate of St Patrick&quot; in 1954 and of &quot;Thirty-Three Triads&quot; in 1955. His most significant work in this area was collected in two volumes. The first of these was &quot;The Táin&quot; (Dolmen, 1969; Oxford University Press, 1970), a version of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; illustrated by Louis le Brocquy.

With Seán Ó Tuama, Kinsella co-edited &quot;An Duanaire: 1600–1900, Poems of the Dispossessed&quot; (1981), an anthology of Irish poems that critic Siobhán Holland describes as a &quot;politicized deployment of the anthology genre&quot;. &quot;An Duanaire&quot; won a &quot;special award&quot; of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature in 1982. He also edited Austin Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems&quot; and &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (both 1974) for Dolmen and &quot;The New Oxford Book of Irish Verse&quot; (1986).

According to critic Dillon Johnston, Kinsella&#x27;s translations of &quot;Táin&quot; and &quot;An Duanaire&quot; have helped to &quot;revitalize&quot; the Irish literary canon.

==Later poetry==
In 1965, Kinsella left the civil service to teach at Southern Illinois University, and in 1970 he became a professor of English at Temple University. In 1973, he started Temple&#x27;s Irish studies programme.

In 1972, he started Peppercanister Press to publish his own work. The first Peppercanister production was &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Dozen&quot;, a satirical response to the Widgery Tribunal into the events of Bloody Sunday. This poem drew on the &quot;aisling&quot; tradition.

Beginning around 1968 with &quot;Nightwalker and Other Poems&quot;, Kinsella&#x27;s work became more influenced by American modernist poetry, particularly the poetry of Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Robert Lowell. In addition, his poetry started to focus more on the individual psyche as seen through the work of Carl Jung. These tendencies appeared in the poems of &quot;Notes from the Land of the Dead&quot; (1973) and &quot;One&quot; (1974).

According to critic Thomas H. Jackson, books including &quot;Her Vertical Smile&quot; (1985), &quot;Out of Ireland&quot; (1987), and &quot;St Catherine&#x27;s Clock&quot; (1987) blended personal and world-historical perspectives: &quot;address a self, and you find the world; address an aspect of the world, and you find a self&quot;. &quot;One Fond Embrace&quot; (1988) and &quot;Poems from Centre City&quot; (1990) allude to historical antecedents including Brian Merriman and medieval curse poetry to dissect contemporary events such as architectural development in Dublin.

<text>After the Battle of Heiligerlee, the Dutch rebel leader Louis of Nassau (brother of William the Silent) failed to capture the city of Groningen. Louis was driven away by Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba and defeated at the Battle of Jemmingen (also known as Battle of Jemgum, at Jemgum in East Frisia, now part of Germany) on 21 July 1568.

==Forces==
The Spanish army consisted of 12,000 infantry (4 tercios), 3,000 cavalry, and some cannons. Louis of Nassau opposed them with 10,000 infantry (2 groups), some cavalry, and 16 cannons.

==Battle==
After three hours of skirmishes, Louis&#x27; army left its trenches and advanced. Pounded by effective musket fire and intimidated by the Spanish cavalry, the advance turned into a general retreat towards the river Ems.

==Aftermath==
On 19 May 1571 a statue of the Duke, cast from one of the captured bronze cannons, was placed in Antwerp citadel. After the Sack of Antwerp in 1576, the city joined the Dutch Revolt and in 1577 the statue was destroyed by an angry crowd.

<doc id="810721" wikidata="Q1288349" url="?curid=810721" title="Íte of Killeedy">
<text>Íte ingen Chinn Fhalad (d. 570/577), also known as Íde, Ita, Ida or Ides, was an early Irish nun and patron saint of Killeedy (Cluain Creadhail). She was known as the &quot;foster mother of the saints of Erin&quot;. The name &quot;Ita&quot; (&quot;thirst for holiness&quot;) was conferred on her because of her saintly qualities. Her feast day is 15 January.

==Life==
Ita, called the &quot;Brigid of Munster&quot;, was born in 480 in the present County Waterford. Her father was Cennfoelad or Confhaola and her mother was Necta. Cennfoelad was descended from Felim the lawgiver, King of Tara. An account of her life in the &quot;Codex Kilkenniensis&quot;, follows the example of Brigit in describing the opposition Íte meets in pursuit of her vocation. Genealogies of the saints go so far as to make Íte&#x27;s mother, Necht, a daughter of Dallbrónach, and therefore a sister of Brigit&#x27;s mother.

She was baptised as Deirdre and grew up near Drum, County Waterford. Ita was said to embody the six virtues of Irish womanhood – wisdom, purity, beauty, musical ability, gentle speech and needle skills. She is also reported to have rejected a prestigious marriage for a life as a consecrated woman religious. At the age of sixteen, she moved to Cluain Creadhail, a place name that has ever since been known as Killeedy – meaning &quot;Church of St. Ita&quot; – in County Limerick, where she founded a small community of nuns and resided for the remainder of her life, in community with other consecrated women. Bishop Declan of Ardmore conferred the veil on her. Legend has it that Ita was led to Killeedy by three heavenly lights. The first was at the top of the Galtee mountains, the second on the Mullaghareirk mountains and the third at Cluain Creadhail, which is nowadays Killeedy. Her sister Fiona also went to Killeedy with her and became a member of the community.

A strongly individualistic character is glimpsed in the stories that surround her life. When she decided to settle in Killeedy, a chieftain offered her a large grant of land to support the convent. But Ita would accept only four acres, which she cultivated intensively. The community group seems to have had a school for little boys where they were taught &quot;Faith in God with purity of heart; simplicity of life with religion; generosity with love&quot;. Her pupils are said to have included Saint Brendan, whom Bishop Erc gave to Ita in foster care when he was a year old. St. Ita kept him until he was six.

The great Navigator visited her between his voyages and always deferred to her counsel. Brendan is believed to have asked her what three things God loved best. &quot;True faith in God and a pure heart, a simple life with a religious spirit and open-handedness inspired by charity,&quot; she answered. The three things God most detested were a scowling face, obstinacy in wrongdoing, and too great a confidence in the power of money.

She dedicated herself to prayer, fasting, simplicity and cultivating a gift for spiritual discernment. She was also endowed with the gift of prophecy and was held in great veneration by a large number of contemporary saints, men as well as women. Ita was said to have a gift for guiding people in holiness. She was much sought after as a spiritual director. During this period of Christianity, the Celtic Church was more advanced than other churches at the time in recognising the qualities of spiritual leadership in women and in encouraging women in this role. It is thought that Ita may have been abbess of a double monastery of men and women.

Her legend places a great deal of emphasis on her austerity, as told by St. Cuimin of County Down, and numerous miracles are recorded of her. She is also said to be the originator of an Irish lullaby for the infant Jesus, an English version of which was set for voice and piano by the American composer Samuel Barber. She probably died of cancer, though contemporary chroniclers describe how her side was consumed by a beetle that eventually grew to the size of a pig. When she felt her end approaching she sent for her community of nuns, and invoked the blessing of heaven on the clergy and laity of the district around Kileedy. Ita died sometime around 570.

==Veneration==
Her grave, frequently decorated with flowers, is in the ruins of Cill Ide, a Romanesque church at Killeedy where her monastery once stood. It was destroyed by Viking invaders in the ninth century. A Romanesque church was later built over its ruins, but that too failed to survive. The site, however, remains a place of pilgrimage today.

A holy well nearby, almost invisible now, was known for centuries for curing smallpox in children and other diseases as well. This well has two names – It is called St. Bernard&#x27;s Well on the OS map, but the local name has always been Tobar Bhaile Ui MhÈidÌn, My Little Ita&#x27;s Well, coming from the place name, Cill Barra MhÈidÌn. &quot;Church of my little Ita&#x27;s Height.&quot;

Not only was St. Ita a saint, but she was the foster mother of St. Brendan the Navigator, and St. Pulcherius (Mochoemog). At the request of Bishop Butler of Limerick, Pope Pius IX granted a special Office and Mass for the feast of St. Ita, which is kept on 15 January. Although not on the Roman calendar of saints, her feast is celebrated as an optional memorial in Ireland. She is also celebrated by the Eastern Orthodox Church on 15 January on the New Calendar.

==Patronage==
St Ita is the patron saint of Killeedy, Ireland, and along with St. Munchin is co-patron of the Diocese of Limerick. She is reportedly a good intercessor in terms of pregnancy and eye illnesses.

St. Ita&#x27;s AFC is the name of the association football club which is based in Killeedy. The saint appears on the club&#x27;s crest.

Another village in County Limerick, Kilmeedy (In Irish – Cill m&#x27;Ide, or church of my Ita) has links with the saint as well – having first set up a church in Kilmeedy before the one in Killeedy.

<doc id="810727" wikidata="Q7588348" url="?curid=810727" title="St. Ides">
<text>St. Ides is a malt liquor manufactured by the Pabst Brewing Company. The beverage contains 8.2% alcohol by volume, which is stronger than many high-alcohol malt liquors. It was launched by the McKenzie River Corporation in 1987. St. Ides gained prominence during the late 1980s and early 1990s through the use of celebrity endorsements by rap artists.

The beer is also available in a number of &quot;St. Ides Special Brews&quot; which have a variety of flavorings, including various fruit flavors.

==Marketing==
The St. Ides brand has used celebrity endorsements by rappers and was unique in its early use of hip hop to build the brand&#x27;s identity. DJ Pooh was brought in to design advertisements for the liquor and was given broad artistic license. In such contexts, the beer was often referred to as the &quot;Crooked &quot;.

Chuck D took a stance against malt liquor advertising and sued the brand&#x27;s then-owner, the McKenzie River Brewing Company, for using his voice without his permission. The controversy generated significant publicity for St. Ides, placed it on the average hip hop listener&#x27;s radar, and was settled out of court. Another lawsuit was filed in 1991 by the New York State Attorney General&#x27;s Office for advertisements allegedly targeting underage minority children. While the lawsuit was settled out of court and without admitting any guilt, the company agreed to pay the state $50,000 to cover the cost of the investigation and stop touting its alcohol content. The brand was also fined and shutdown for three days in 1991 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. While the brand maintained that it has not purposefully targeted minors, it agreed to produce advertisements warning against underage drinking, drunk driving, and public service announcements promoting safe sex. In 1994, a free promotional tape was released featuring the music in advertisements from Snoop Doggy Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg, MC Eiht, Scarface, Ice Cube and Wu-Tang Clan. St. Ides also released &quot;St. Ides Special Blend Freeze And Squeeze&quot; in July 1997, but had to suspend sales and marketing nationwide 24 days later due to concerns over underage consumption, marketing, and product placement.

McKenzie discontinued the brand in 1998 before it was purchased by Pabst Brewing Company.

== Cannabis ==
Beginning in 2021, St Ides entered the cannabis market in legal states including California, Oregon, and Nevada, with their &quot;High Tea&quot; cannabis infused drinks. They have also started marketing THC infused drink mixes.

==Trivia==
*St. Ides was originally called St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor and was 6.2% and 7.3% ABV, then the brew was reformulated in the early 2000s and the alcohol content became 8.1 &amp; 8.2% ABV and St Ides became St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor.
*St. Ides has been parodied in the movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood&quot; with the name &quot;St. DiES&quot;.
*Rappers that have mentioned St. Ides in their music include Big Daddy Kane, Mobb Deep, Andre Nickatina, Ice Cube, 2Pac, Kool G Rap, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Game, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg, Afroman, MC Eiht, Spice 1, Scarface, E-40, Wu-Tang Clan, Project Pat, King Tee, DJ Pooh, The Notorious B.I.G., Eric B &amp; Rakim, EPMD, Method Man &amp; Redman, Eazy-E, Cypress Hill, Ramirez (rapper) RBL Posse, Mr. Doctor, Brotha Lynch Hung, Luniz, Jarren Benton, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Phantom Balance, Tha Dogg Pound, Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis, Beanie Sigel, the Geto Boys, Luniz and KMD.
* Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis had a song titled &quot;St. Ides&quot; on the album &quot;This Unruly Mess I&#x27;ve Made&quot;.
*Comedian Chris Rock has a line in the song &quot;Champagne&quot;, &quot;My baby&#x27;s father, brought me a case of St. Ides (did you like it?)&quot;
*Musician Elliott Smith recorded a song titled &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot; for his 1995 self-titled album.

<text>Luray Caverns, previously Luray Cave, is a cave just west of Luray, Virginia, United States, which has drawn many visitors since its discovery in 1878. The cavern system is adorned with speleothems such as columns, mud flows, stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, and mirrored pools. The caverns host the Great Stalacpipe Organ, a lithophone made from solenoid-fired strikers that tap stalactites of varied sizes to produce tones similar to those of xylophones, tuning forks, or bells.

A Smithsonian Institution report of July 13 and 14, 1880, concluded: &quot;[I]t is safe to say that there is probably no other cave in the world more completely and profusely decorated with stalactite and stalagmite ornamentation than that of Luray.&quot;

Luray Caverns is privately owned by the Graves family, who have lived in Luray for many years. Theodore Clay Northcott, great-grandfather to the owners, purchased the land on which the caverns are located in 1905.

== Description ==
Visitors enter the cave via a path that curves downward through the caverns, eventually reaching Dream Lake, The Saracen&#x27;s Tent, The Great Stalacpipe Organ and some large stalactites and stalagmites. The path proceeds to the Wishing Well and a war memorial honoring veterans from Page County. It then ascends to a small passage past the Fried Eggs rock formation and returns to ground level through a smaller passage to the entrance. The entire trek is long and can be completed in 45 minutes to 1 hour. Visitors can carry small pets on the cave tour, and leashed pets are permitted on the grounds outside the cave. The caverns now offer a step-free access. While this extended pathway will allow for wheelchair access, the caverns aren&#x27;t advertised as handicap accessible.

==History==
===Discovery===
Luray Caverns was discovered on August 13, 1878, by five local men, including Andrew J. Campbell (a local tinsmith), William Campbell, John “Quint” Campbell, and local photographer Benton Stebbins. Their attention had been attracted by a protruding limestone outcrop and by a nearby sinkhole noted to have cool air issuing from it. Seeking a cavern, the men started to dig and, about four hours later, a hole was created for the smallest men (Andrew and Quint) to squeeze through, slide down a rope and explore by candlelight. The first column they saw was named the Washington Column, in honor of the first United States President. Upon entering the area called Skeleton&#x27;s Gorge, bone fragments (among other artifacts) were found embedded in calcite. Other traces of previous human occupation include pieces of charcoal, flint, and human bone fragments embedded in stalagmite. A skeleton, thought to be that of a Native American girl, found in one of the chasms, was estimated, from the current rate of stalagmitic growth, to be not more than 500 years old. Her remains may have slipped into the caverns after her burial hole collapsed due to a sinkhole, although the real cause is unknown.

===Litigation===
Sam Buracker of Luray owned the land on which the cavern entrance was found. Because of uncollected debts, a court-ordered auction of all his land was held on September 14, 1878. Andrew Campbell, William Campbell, and Benton Stebbins purchased the cave tract, but kept their discovery secret until after the sale. Because the true value of the property was not realized until after the purchase, legal wrangling ensued for the next two years with attempts to prove fraud and decide rightful ownership. In April 1881, the Supreme Court of Virginia nullified the purchase by the cave discoverers. William T. Biedler of Baltimore (Buracker&#x27;s in-law and major creditor) then sold the property to The Luray Cave and Hotel Company, a subsidiary of the Shenandoah Railroad Company. (The SRC became the Norfolk and Western Railroad Company in April 1881.) David Kagery of Luray and George Marshall of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, purchased the property in July 1890 and in October of that year the tract was sold to the Valley Land and Improvement Company. Under bankruptcy proceedings in 1893, the property was bought by Luray Caverns Company, owned by J. Kemp Bartlett of Baltimore.

Despite the legal disputes, rumors of the caverns&#x27; impressive formations spread quickly. Professor Jerome J. Collins, the Arctic explorer, postponed his departure on an ill-fated North Pole expedition to visit the caverns. The Smithsonian Institution sent a delegation of nine scientists to investigate. The next edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; devoted an unprecedented page and a half to the cave&#x27;s wonders and Alexander J. Brand, Jr., a correspondent for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, was the first professional travel writer to visit and popularize the caverns.

===Limair Sanatorium===
In 1901, the cool, supposedly pure air of Luray Caverns was forced through the rooms of the Limair Sanatorium, erected on the summit of Cave Hill by Colonel Theodore Clay Northcott, former president of the Luray Caverns Corporation. The Colonel billed the sanatorium as the first air-conditioned home in the United States. On the hottest day in summer, the interior of the house was kept at a cool and comfortable . By sinking a shaft in diameter down to a cavern chamber and installing a fan powered by a electric motor, Northcott&#x27;s system could change out the air through the entire house about every four minutes. Tests made over successive years by means of culture media and sterile plates were considered to have demonstrated the &quot;perfect bacteriologic purity&quot; of the air, purportedly a benefit to those suffering various respiratory illnesses. This &quot;purity&quot; was explained by a natural filtration process with air drawn into the caverns through myriad rocky crevices, then further cleansing by air floating over the transparent springs and pools, the product finally being supplied to the inmates of the sanatorium. The &quot;Limair&quot; burned down in the early 1900s but was subsequently rebuilt as a brick building. The Luray Caverns Corporation, which was chartered by Northcott, purchased the caverns in February 1905 and continues to hold the property today.

===Commercialization===
Portions of the caverns are open to the public and have long been electrically lighted. The registered number of visitors in 1906 was 18,000, but as of 2018, approximately 500,000 guests visit each year.

In 1974, the National Park Service and the Department of the Interior designated Luray Caverns as a National Natural Landmark.

Luray Caverns is home to a commercial rope course and hedge maze. The maze contains 1,500 dark American arborvitae which create a path for visitors. Three museums are also on site and included with the general admission. The Toy Town Junction Museum offers an array of vintage miniature trains, dolls, and other collectible toys on display. The Car and Carriage Caravan Museum features an impressive collection of over 140 items relating to early transportation including a Conestoga wagon and an 1892 Mercedes-Benz. The Shenandoah Heritage Village is home to a collection of historic Shenandoah Valley buildings from rustic 19th-century life and the Luray Valley Museum contains many regional artifacts of significance including a 1536 Zürich Bible and a patented dog-powered butter churn.

==Geology==

The caverns are situated in the Shenandoah Valley, just to the west of the Blue Ridge of the Appalachian Mountains in Luray, Virginia. The valley extends northeast to southwest along the northwest side of the Blue Ridge. Cave Hill, above sea level, had long been an object of local interest on account of its pits and oval hollows or sinkholes (known as karst) through one of which the discoverers of Luray Caverns entered.

Luray Caverns does not date beyond the Tertiary period. The cave is developed in dolomites of the lower Beekmantown Dolomite (Lower Ordovician). At some period, niches and already formed chambers were completely filled with water, highly charged with acid, which then slowly began to eat away at much of the softer material composing much of the walls, ceilings and floors. The one particular area that shows this high level of water is Elfin Ramble where water marks of oscillation are highly visible on the ceiling.

The temperature inside the caverns is uniformly , comparable to that of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.

===Speleothem formation===

As with other limestone or &quot;solution&quot; caves, formations at Luray Caverns result from a solution of calcium carbonate giving up some of its carbon dioxide, thus allowing a precipitation of lime to form. This precipitation begins as a thin deposit ring of crystallized calcite, but continues to collect, creating stalactites and other types of dripstone and flowstone. Formations at Luray Caverns are white in color if the calcium carbonate is in its pure form. Other colors reflect impurities in the calcite resulting from elements absorbed from the soil or rock layers: Reds and yellows due to iron and iron-stained clays; black from manganese dioxide; blues and greens from solutions of copper compounds. Luray Caverns remains an active cave where new formation deposits accumulate at the rate of about every 120 years.

===Celebrated speleothems===
After the water had been mostly removed by a lowering in the water table, these eroded forms remained and growth began to take hold via stalactites, stalagmites, columns, etc. Some notable formations include the Leaning Column, undermined and tilting like the campanile of Pisa; The Great Stalacpipe Organ, a large shield formation, that was used from very early on as an instrument for a variety of folk and religious songs; and a vast bed of disintegrated carbonates left by the water in its retreat through the great space called the Elfin Ramble.

The cavern is yellow, brown or red because of water, chemicals and minerals. The new stalactites growing from the old, and made of hard carbonates that had already once been used, are usually white as snow though often pink or amber-colored. The Empress Column is a stalagmite high, rose-colored, and elaborately draped. The Double Column, named from Professors Henry and Baird, is made of two fluted pillars side by side, the one the other high, a mass of snowy alabaster. Several stalactites in Giant&#x27;s Hall exceed in length. The Pluto&#x27;s Ghost, a pillar, is a ghostly white.

The cascades are formations like foaming cataracts caught in mid-air and transformed into milk-white or amber alabaster. Brands Cascade is high and wide, and is a wax-like white.
Flowstone draperies are abundant throughout the cavern and one of the best examples is Saracen&#x27;s Tent. The drapery formation can be found in all major rooms and ring like bells when struck heavily by the hand. Their origin and also that of certain so-called scarfs and blankets is from carbonates deposited by water trickling down a sloping and corrugated surface. Sixteen of these alabaster scarfs hang side by side in Hoveys Balcony, three white and fine as crape shawls, thirteen striated like agate with various shades of brown.

Streams and true springs are absent, but there are hundreds of basins, some of which are in diameter, and up to in depth. The water in them contains carbonate of lime, which often forms concretions, called pearls, eggs, and snowballs, according to their size. On the fracture these spherical growths are found to be radiated in structure.

Calcite crystals line the sides and bottom of water-filled cavities. Variations of level at different periods are marked by rings, ridges and ruffled margins. These are strongly marked about Broaddus Lake and the curved ramparts of the Castles on the Rhine. Here also are polished stalagmites, a rich buff slashed with white, and others, like huge mushrooms, with a velvety coat of red, purple or olive-tinted crystals. In some of the smaller basins it sometimes happens that, when the excess of carbonate acid escapes rapidly, there is formed, besides the crystal bed below, a film above, shot like a sheet of ice across the surface. One pool wide is thus covered so as to show but a third of its surface.

The quantity of water in the cavern varies greatly at different seasons. Hence some stalactites have their tips under water long enough to allow tassels of crystals to grow on them, which, in a drier season, are again coated over with stalactitic matter; and thus singular distortions are occasioned. Contiguous stalactites are often inwrapped thus until they assume an almost globular form, through which by making a section the primary tubes appear. Contorted stalactites may be caused by lateral outgrowths of crystals growing from the side of an active stalactite, or to deflections caused by currents of air, or to the existence of a diminutive fungus peculiar to the locality and designated from its habitat &quot;Mucor stalactitis&quot;.

The dimensions of the chambers included in Luray Caverns cannot be easily stated, due to the great irregularity of their outlines. There are several tiers of galleries, and the vertical depth from the highest to the lowest is .

===Luray Cavern waters===

There is a spring of water called Dream Lake that has an almost mirror-like appearance. Stalactites are reflected in the water making them appear to be stalagmites. This illusion is often so convincing that people are unable to see the real bottom. It looks quite deep, as the stalactites are higher above the water, but at its deepest point the water is only around deep. The lake is connected to a spring that continues deeper into the caverns.

The Wishing Well is a green pond with coins, deep at the bottom. Like Dream Lake, the well also gives an illusion, however it is reversed. The pond looks deep but at its deepest point it is actually deep.

==In popular culture==
The 2008 videogame &quot;Fallout 3&quot; features a cave system known as Lamplight Caverns. Emil Pagliarulo, one of the developers, stated that Luray Caverns served as a loose inspiration.

<text>G-Sides (sometimes spelled as G Sides) is a B-sides collection by Gorillaz from their first studio album session, &quot;Gorillaz&quot; and the &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; EP. The compilation was originally released only in Japan on 22 December 2001. The US edition, with a slightly different track listing, followed on 26 February 2002. The European version, released on 11 March 2002, features the original Japanese track listing. The Japanese and US editions are different because the songs &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Left Hand Suzuki Method&quot; are included on the standard US edition of &quot;Gorillaz&quot; as bonus tracks. The Brazilian limited edition release incorporates all of the tracks from both the Japanese and US versions of the album. Most versions have the same cover, featuring Noodle holding a skeleton doll in her hand, named &quot;Bonesy&quot;, although some—notably the Japanese version—have her holding a Godzilla figurine instead. On the top of the sleeve, the title is written in katakana: ジー サイズ (&quot;Jī Saizu&quot;). &quot;G-Sides&quot; reached number 65 on the UK Albums Chart and number 84 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;The Sounder&quot; first appeared on the French limited edition bonus disc of &quot;Gorillaz&quot; and is 6:16 in length. On this album and the &quot;Rock the House&quot; single, it is edited to 4:29.

<doc id="810741" wikidata="Q531589" url="?curid=810741" title="Renault Scénic">
<text>The Renault Scénic (), also spelled without the acute accent as Scenic, especially in languages other than French, is a car which was produced by French car manufacturer Renault, the first to be labelled as a small multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) in Europe. The first generation was based on the chassis of the Mégane, a small family car. It became the 1997 European Car of the Year on its launch in November 1996. In May 2022 Renault announced it was discontinuing the standard Scénic with the Grand Scénic following shortly after. It was relaunched in 2024 as a fully electric vehicle called the Renault Scénic E-Tech which is the production version of the Renault Scénic Vision concept unveiled in 2022, with the production version to be unveiled at the 2023 Munich Motor Show on September 4.

The first generation facelifted Scénic added a four-wheel drive model called the Renault Scénic RX4, which was discontinued by the arrival of the Scénic II. The second, third and fourth generations have a model called Grand Scénic, which has seven seats rather than five. From the fourth generation (2016), the Scénic now utilizes 1/3-2/3 bench rear seats instead of three individual rear seats used in previous three generations, due to cost cutting measures.


==First generation (1996)==
The Mégane Scénic can be traced back to a concept car of 1991, the Renault S.C.E.N.I.C. (Safety Concept Embodied in a New Innovative Car) designed under the supervision of Anne Asensio, then designer at Renault. The production vehicle, the Mégane Scénic was launched in November 1996. It was marketed as a multi purpose vehicle, in a smaller size and lower price than such vehicles as Renault&#x27;s own Espace. As its name suggests, the Mégane Scénic was mechanically identical to the Mégane hatchback (itself based on the older R19). The 1.4 L, 1.6 L &quot;Energy&quot;, 1.8 L &quot;F Type&quot; petrol and 1.9 L diesel engines were shared with the hatchback range. The production model kept the independent seats of the concept car, but didn&#x27;t offer sliding doors.

Renault decided to add an acute accent to the production model name (Mégane Scénic), in order to assert its European identity, in a context of growing competition of newer car manufacturers coming from Japan.

Renault underestimated the market demand that the Scénic would have — predicting that it would be a niche model with only 450 produced a day. Production at the company&#x27;s Douai plant would eventually peak at nearly 2,500 cars a day.

===Facelift===

Along with the Mégane hatchback, the Scénic underwent a major frontal restyle in September 1999, and the newer 16 valve engines were introduced. The front end was quite a bit different from the Mégane counterpart, and there were also redesigned rear lights.

From the time of this restyle, it became officially known as the Renault Scénic, although a small &quot;Mégane&quot; badge still appeared on the rear door signifying the car&#x27;s origin. Production ended in June 2003.

The Phase 2 allowed the Scénic to be separate from the Mégane and its predecessor by introducing improvements, such as a storage compartment on the dashboard, and a separate opening rear window on the tailgate.

Another small improvement with the Scénic were the rear head restraints, which were fixed over the back of the seat rather than being upright. This increased rear visibility.

=== Latin America ===
From 1998 to July 2010, the Scénic was manufactured in Curitiba, Brazil, for South American markets. It was available with flex fuel engines. From 2006, an appearance package which added black plastic bumpers and fog lamps called the Scénic Sportway was produced. It was different from the European Scénic RX4.

It was also assembled in Mexico from December 2000 to mid-2004 at Cuernavaca Nissan plant. This was the very first cross-manufacturing operation between the two brands of the newly created Renault-Nissan Alliance.

=== Asia ===
In 2004, Iran&#x27;s Kish Khodro had planned to build a facelifted version of the Scénic as the Kish Khodro/Sinad Veek, but in 2005 Renault decided to focus on their long standing relationship with SAIPA and ended other Iranian collaborations. The Sinad Veek was listed as available for a little bit longer (without the discreet Renault logos which appeared on the first prototype), but it appears not to have entered production.

===Engines===

===Scenic RX4===


Renault developed a four-wheel drive crossover derivative of the original Scénic, the Scénic RX4, launched in 2000 in both LHD and RHD formats. Featuring a viscous, multi disc central differential designed by Austrian specialists Steyr Daimler Puch, it offered part time four wheel drive. The rear suspension was re-engineered, the suspension was strengthened, the gearbox was redesigned to accommodate the four-wheel drive system, and the engine undercover was thickened and strengthened. The exterior was also changed, featuring plastic cladding around the entire car, a spare wheel on the tailgate, and different wheels from the standard Scénic, using five lug-nuts as opposed to the standard four. 

The new rear suspension now occupied part of the space that was used for the spare wheel well and led to the spare tyre being placed on the rear hatch, which was converted into a split swing out tailgate. To save weight, the redesigned tailgate was constructed from plastic, which meant the door was prone to cracking under its own weight with the spare wheel under normal use (becoming especially prevalent as the plastic aged). The RX4 rode higher with increased suspension travel and larger wheels than the Scenic.

While these changes provided better ground clearance, the RX4 was offered with 2.0-litre petrol and 1.9-dci diesel engines, both already known from the Mégane. The RX4 used five lug nuts, as opposed to four on the standard Scénic. Unlike the standard Scénic, the RX4 was only offered with a 5 speed manual transmission, with no automatic transmission available.

In most markets, the RX4 was offered in several trim levels, including the Sport Alize (2000), Privilege Monaco (2000), Expression (2001–2003), Dynamique (2001–2003), Salomon (2001–2003), Sportway (2001–2003), and Privilege (2001–2003). In less popular markets such as Australia, the RX4 was only offered the Expression and Privilege trim levels.

The RX4 was also offered with twin electric sunroofs, a luxury pack (including leather seats, climate control, and a CD player), a spare wheel cover, and roof racks as optional extras.

The RX4 sales made a good start (becoming France&#x27;s best-selling 4wd vehicle in 2001), but sales rapidly declined due to poor gearbox reliability. Renault only produced 40,000 examples of the RX4, 5000 right-hand drive and 35,000 left-hand drive examples. Production was ultimately halted due to the arrival of the Scénic II and due to poor sales. Production of the RX4 ceased in December 2003, with no direct successor, most likely a result of the unreliability of the Steyr Daimler Puch 4wd system. It was eventually partially replaced in 2007 by the 2wd &quot;Scénic Conquest.&quot;

The RX4 sold particularly poorly in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Malaysia. Selling fewer than 500 units in each country. Due to low demand, these countries did not receive the diesel F9Q engine, instead only receiving the petrol F4R engine.

As of 2023, approximately only 1,500 of the original 40,000 RX4 examples remain on the road worldwide. The RX4 is the second rarest Renault model of the 2000s, following the Renault Avantime. This low number is attributed to low parts availability and reliability; with no more parts produced and a limited number of RX4&#x27;s built, parts are becoming increasingly scarce.


==Second generation (2003)==


Shortly after the launch of the Mégane II, an all new Scénic was launched in June 2003. There was also a seven-seater Compact MPV Grand Scénic, with a longer wheelbase and rear overhang, which has two small child sized seats in the enlarged luggage area. The Grand Scénic was officially launched in April 2004.

As with the Mégane, the new car employs corporate styling cues and new technology, including the &quot;Renault Card&quot; keyless immobiliser and an automatic parking brake on certain trim levels. It integrates LEDs on all trims since 2006. As with the Scénic I Phase 2, a raised &quot;Mégane&quot; logo appears on the C pillar.

The car received a different dashboard design to that of the Mégane, and featured a fully digital electroluminescence instrument display.

The Scénic II includes folding rear passenger seats, each separately adjustable and removable. With integrated table, a folding front passenger seat (on certain trim levels), automatic headlights and windscreen wipers, &#x27;Child minder&#x27; mirror, as well as front and rear electric windows.

Unlike its predecessor, the Scénic II was not available at any Yanase Co., Ltd. dealerships, as Yanase had ended its import rights for Renault after Renault had acquired a stake in Nissan when the Scénic I was still in production. Instead, the Scénic II was sold exclusively through Nissan locations.

===Facelift===
Like the Mégane a few months earlier, the Scénic II underwent a minor facelift with a revised grille, larger diamond badge, the addition of a &quot;RENAULT&quot; word badge on the and new wheel designs and interior trim. Sales commenced in September 2006.
===Scénic Conquest===

In June 2007, the spiritual successor to the &quot;RX4&quot; was revealed in the form of the production ready &quot;Scénic Conquest&quot;. Although powered by two wheel drive, the Conquest has a body kit, raised ride height and features accessories usually reserved for SUVs.
==Third generation (2009)==

The Scénic III was released in July 2009, while the seven seater &#x27;Grand&#x27; version (New Grand Scénic) was released in May 2009. Like the previous Scénic, there is also a seven-seater Compact MPV Grand Scénic. Renault also offers the Grand Scénic as a five seater.

Differences such as plastic cladding, raised suspension and different wheels to the normal spec Scénic.

===Facelift===

In January 2012, the Scénic and Grand Scénic was mildly facelifted with a new front end, new engines and a new digital instrument cluster design.

An updated Scénic and Grand Scénic were released in March 2013, which features a new interior and exterior styling and driver aids. At the same time, Renault introduced a crossover version of the Scénic, which was called the Scénic Xmod (Scenic Xmod Cross in Italy). The Scénic Xmod has different styling to the normal Scénic : larger and revised grille, roof racks, body protections, new tires and alloys, new paintwork and Xmod badges. It also features Renault Extended Grip enhanced traction control.

Both the Scénic and Grand Scénic can be specified with an Efficient Dual Clutch gearbox, mated to the 1.5dci (110 bhp) engine.

==Fourth generation (2016)==


A fourth generation Scénic was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The car, based on the R-Space concept, is slightly larger than its predecessor, and adds some crossover design elements but, according to Renault, it is still an MPV.

It is powered by six diesel and two petrol engines. For the models with six-speed manual transmission and Energy dCi 110 diesel engines, it will incorporate an optional hybrid unit (Hybrid Assist). The Scénic will be offered with manual or double clutch gear box. The Scénic offer a 572 L trunk and the Grand Scénic 765 L with five seats.

The MKIV Scénic received a five star rating in Euro NCAP, with a range of standard active and passive safety features, including &#x27;Active Emergency Braking System&#x27; with &#x27;Pedestrian Detection&#x27; making the Renault Scénic the only compact MPV with this feature as standard.

The Scénic also features &#x27;Lane Keeping Assist&#x27; and &#x27;Fatigue Detection Alert&#x27;. Above 50 km/h, the Scénic can detect fatigue associated driving and alerts the driver, if the driver does not react, it is able to correct the trajectory autonomously.

In May 2022, Renault announced the short-body Scénic is to be discontinued, a few months before the Grand Scénic. The short-body Scénic production was stopped in July 2022, after 190,636 units produced.

==Scénic in the United Kingdom==
Sales of the Scénic in the United Kingdom began in May 1997, and for the first two years, the Scénic was the only compact MPV sold by a mainstream manufacturer in the United Kingdom, however the Vauxhall Zafira, Citroën Xsara Picasso, Fiat Multipla and the Nissan Almera Tino were launched in less than five years. In 1997, the &quot;Mégane Scénic&quot; was awarded the &quot;Car of the Year&quot; by &quot;What Car?&quot;.

The Scénic II arrived in showrooms in the country in September 2003. The Scénic III arrived in showrooms in the country in May 2009. The Scénic IV arrived in showrooms in the end of 2016 and UK sales were ended completely in 2019 due to declining popularity of MPVs there.

In October 2014, &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; placed the Scénic XMOD on its list of &quot;The Worst Cars You Can Buy Right Now&quot;. The facelifted versions could be specified with the R Link touchscreen system, that includes a digital radio.

==Scénic in Australia==

Sales of the Scénic in Australia began in 2001 alongside the Scenic RX4, Clio, and Megane Convertible. Sales of the Scenic were weak and as such the Scenic RX4 was introduced to compete with crossovers such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV. Although demand for crossovers was large, the RX4 failed to gain much popularity and ended up selling a total of 418 units from 2001 to 2003. 

The Scénic II arrived in showrooms in Australia in 2004 after the discontinuation of the Scenic I and Scenic RX4. The Scenic II was sold from 2004-2010, but sales were poor, especially since the introduction of the Koleos to the market in 2008. As such, in 2010 Renault Australia announced it would not be bringing the Scenic III to Australia. When the Scenic IV was announced in 2016, Renault Australia again announced it had no plans of bringing the model to the country with strong sales of the Koleos and Captur. As of 2024, Renault Australia sell exclusively SUV’s and Van’s, these models being the Koleos, Captur, Arkana, Megane E-tech, Kangoo, Trafic, and Master.

==Recall==
Electronic defects have caused Renault to issue two recalls. The first, in October 2009, was because of the dashboard could stop functioning, leaving drivers without the ability to gauge their speed, fuel tank, direction indicators or anything as all instruments were totally electronic.

At first drivers had to replace this part at their own expense, but eventually, because of media pressure, Renault UK and Ireland said that they would reimburse customers up to a set limit. No reimburse was implemented by Renault in Finland where several independent workshops launched an affordable priced fixing of blanked Scénic panels.

The cause of the unexpected instrument panel blankening originated from some defective soldering which caused the power transistor to overheat and fail. The fault occurred in Scénic II cars made between 2003 and 2006. The second, in August 2010, was because the electric handbrake could sometimes engage on its own while the car was in motion.

==Alternative propulsion==
The Cleanova III, presented in the 2005 Geneva Auto Show, is based on a Scénic platform.

<text>Andrea Grubb Barthwell (born 1953 or 1954) worked in the White House under President of the United States George W. Bush as deputy director for Demand Reduction at the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

==Education==
Barthwell studied at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology in 1976. She went on to medical school at the University of Michigan, graduating in 1980 with her M.D. Barthwell then moved to suburban Chicago where she participated in post-graduate studies at the University of Chicago and through the medical center of Northwestern University.

==Professional career==
After entering the medical profession, Barthwell became President of the Illinois Society of Addiction Medicine and then President of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, an area of medicine that has been one of her specialties. She served as President of the Encounter Medical Group, an Oak Park, Illinois, professional consortium that also focused on addiction health care. In nearby Chicago, Barthwell also has headed two drug treatment organizations: BRASS Foundation, a provider of addiction treatment services, and interventions. In 1997, Barthwell&#x27;s peers named her one of the &quot;Best Doctors in America&quot; in addiction medicine. In 2003, Barthwell received the Betty Ford Award, given by the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse.

Barthwell founded and is the director of the addiction treatment network Two Dreams, with locations in Chicago, the Outer Banks, and New Orleans.

==Bush administration==
Barthwell resigned her position in July 2004 for a possible run for the United States Senate from Illinois with the Republican Party. Earlier, nominee Jack Ryan had dropped out of the race, leaving the party without a candidate. Barthwell was favored by moderates on the Illinois Republican Central Committee to run against Democratic candidate Barack Obama, but conservative committee members ultimately won out after two days of gridlock, forcing the committee to select perennial candidate Alan Keyes of Maryland. Keyes went on to lose to Obama in a landslide.

<text>A professional technical school () – &quot;professionalno-tehnicheskoye uchilishche&quot; (acronym: PTU; ПТУ, пэ-тэ-у́) is a type of vocational education facility established in the former Soviet Union to train qualified industrial workers and servicemen. Such schools are widespread in post-Soviet countries (with one or more in most cities). 

==Background==

By the reign of Nicholas II, a rudimentary and rather loose network of vocational institutions existed throughout the Russian Empire, drawing its support and funding from various sources including the state and industry and catering to students of varying levels of literacy and other preparation. A similar situation existed in areas that were not immediately absorbed into the USSR. The physical capital of these schools served as a kernel for subsequent Soviet institutions, a network expanded rapidly in concert with the industrialization drives of Soviet leaders.

In the 1920–1930s, the forerunners of PTU&#x27;s included &quot;schools of factory and plant apprenticeship&quot;(Russian:&quot;шко́ла фабри́чно-заводско́го учени́чества&quot; – &quot;Shkola fabrichno-zavodskogo uchenichestva&quot;, acronym: FZU; ФЗУ, фэ-зэ-у́), which were partly inherited from the vocational school system of the Russian Empire. In 1940, they were reorganized to &quot;vocational schools&quot; (Russian:&quot;реме́сленное учи́лище&quot; – &quot;Remeslennoye uchilishche&quot;), and in 1959 to PTUs.

PTUs, increasingly standardized through the 1960s, formed a government-funded USSR-wide system for school graduates who didn&#x27;t intend to receive a university degree. Instead, they were both educated generally and trained for non-academic occupations. There were PTUs specializing in almost all such professions, but the most common were construction and machinery positions. Specializations also included electricians, secretaries (girls only), cooks, waiters and even mosaic artists (needed drawing talents to apply). The usual entering age for students was 15 – after 8 years of ordinary school, with students coming from peasant backgrounds, the lower working class, orphanages and the like. Two or three years of learning were typical, though some students would enter after 10 years of ordinary school and learn during 1 year.

PTUs sometimes required no entrance examination and provided students with free dormitories and meals. Parents were also attracted by the 24-hour presence of &quot;upbringers&quot; – mentors tasked with preventing students from engaging in deviant behavior. Further employment was also guaranteed, as well as the possibility of continuing education at university level. PTUs played an important role in urbanizing rural communities and forming the Soviet working class (see Urbanization).

==PTU&#x27;s in the Post-Soviet Period==
During the transformation to a market economy, Many PTUs were merged or some PTUs were renamed and reformed into &quot;lyceums&quot; in an attempt to gain higher status and establish tuition fees.

<text>The &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines are Australian-built diesel-electric submarines operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The &quot;Collins&quot; class takes its name from Australian Vice Admiral John Augustine Collins; each of the six submarines is named after significant RAN personnel who distinguished themselves in action during . The six vessels were the first submarines built in Australia, prompting widespread improvements in Australian industry and delivering a sovereign (Australian controlled) sustainment/maintenance capability.

Planning for a new design to replace the RAN&#x27;s submarines began in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Proposals were received from seven companies; two were selected for a funded study to determine the winning design, which was announced in mid-1987. The submarines, enlarged versions of Swedish shipbuilder Kockums&#x27; and originally referred to as the Type 471, were constructed between 1990 and 2003 in South Australia by the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC).

The submarines have been the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the &quot;Collins&quot; class. After 20 years of service issues, the boats have finally provided high availability to the RAN since 2016.

The &quot;Collins&quot; class was expected to be retired about 2026, however, the 2016 Defence White Paper extended this into the 2030s. The &quot;Collins&quot; class life will now be extended and will receive an unplanned capability upgrade, including sonar and communications.

The initial replacement for the &quot;Collins&quot; class was to be a conventionally-powered version of the Barracuda-class SSN proposed by Naval Group of France, dubbed the . On 15 September 2021, in the face of growing delays and cost increases, the Australian government announced the cancellation of the contract with Naval Group, and that the replacement will be a nuclear-powered submarine fleet made in partnership with the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Development and design==
The proposal for a new type of submarine to replace the &quot;Oberon&quot; class of diesel-electric submarines began in July 1978, when the RAN director of submarine policy prepared a paper detailing the need to start considering a replacement for the ageing &quot;Oberon&quot;s. The paper also raised the suggestion that the majority of the submarines be constructed in Australia and that the number of submarines be increased beyond the six &quot;Oberon&quot;s. Building the submarines in Australia was initially met with reactions predicting an impossible task because of the poor state of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and Australian industry in general, although campaigning by several figures in Australian industry who thought it could be done came to the attention of those spearheading the project to design the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class replacement, and led to the view that it was both possible and feasible. The campaign to build submarines in Australia was also met with support from the Australian Labor Party and several trade unions.

The proposal was accepted by the defence operational requirements committee in August 1978, and the project was given the procurement designation of SEA 1114. Approval for the development phase of the project was given in the 1981–82 federal budget. The RAN had four main requirements: that the submarines were tailored to operating conditions in the Australasian region, that they be equipped with a combat system advanced enough to promote a long service life, that appropriate and sustainable infrastructure be established in Australia to construct the boats, then provide maintenance and technical support for their operational lifespan, and that the submarines were capable of peacetime and emergency operations in addition to their hunter-killer role. Ten submarines were envisioned, a number which was revised to between four and eight boats by the start of 1983, and later settled on the acquisition of six submarines, with the option to order two more.

===Requests for tenders===
The development of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for tender and approached seven of the world&#x27;s nine diesel-electric submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the provided information, with these undergoing a funded study to determine the winning design. Tendering companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would be incorporated into the project, and that they were willing to establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines. All seven companies responded by the end of the year: the combined submissions totalling four tonnes (9,000 lb) of paper.
* Directions Techniques Des Constructions Naval of France originally supplied a design modified from the , but the submission review board did not view this favourably, as the submarine was of the same vintage as the &quot;Oberon&quot;s. Their submission was altered to a conventionally powered version of the &quot;Rubis&quot;-class nuclear submarine.
* The German companies Ingenieur Kontor Lübeck (IKL) and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) collaborated to offer an enlarged version of the Type 209 submarine, designated the Type 2000. Submarines based on the Type 209 design had been exported to several nations, but were not operated by the German Navy.
* Thyssen Nordseewerke, another German company, offered their . Like the Type 209, the TR-1700 was an export-only submarine design.
* Cantieri Navali Riuniti of Italy proposed a design based on their , scaled up by 25%. The age of the early 1970s design was a concern, and the proposal was withdrawn early in the process.
* The Dutch partnership of United Shipbuilder Bureaux and Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij submitted the . Their offer was identical to that constructed for the Royal Netherlands Navy, minus the Dutch combat system.
* Swedish shipbuilder Kockums submitted the Type 471 design, an enlarged version of the operated by the Swedish Navy.
* The United Kingdom company Vickers Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering offered a design referred to as the Type 2400, that later became the &quot;Upholder&quot; class.
The review board concluded that the IKL/HDW Type 2000 was the best design offered, the &quot;Walrus&quot; class was rated as &#x27;fair&#x27;, while Kockums&#x27; and Vickers&#x27; proposals were considered &#x27;marginal&#x27; contenders. However, none of the tenders completely matched the desired RAN specifications, and the two proposals selected would have to be redesigned during the funded study.

The combat data system was procured separately to the submarine design; 14 companies were identified as capable of providing what the RAN wanted, from which eight were approached in January 1983 with a separate request for tender. Five responded: a consortium led by Rockwell International of the United States, Plessey of the United Kingdom, Signaal of the Netherlands, Sintra Alcatel of France, and a collaboration between the German Krupp Atlas Elektronik and the British Ferranti. Each tender was required to offer a system with a distributed architecture, despite the absence of an accepted definition for &#x27;distributed computing&#x27; at that time, and had to show the cost of programming the software in Ada, although they could offer additional cost breakdowns for other programming languages.

===Funded studies===
By May 1985, three months behind schedule, the review board narrowed the tenders down to two contenders in each group: IKL/HDW and Kockums for the submarine, Rockwell and Signaal for the combat system. The &quot;Walrus&quot; and Type 2400 submarine designs were considered to be too expensive to manufacture because of inefficient building practices, while the combat data system tenders had been narrowed down by unjustified development risk in the Plessey and Krupp/Ferranti proposals, and the dual problems in the Sintra Alcatel tender of excessive power usage and incompatibility with the proposed American weapons system. On 9 May, the Australian cabinet approved the selections for the funded studies and decided that six submarines would be built, with the option for two more, all in Australia.

The companies were granted funding for project definition studies, from which the final selections would be made. Liaison teams were sent to each of the four companies to observe the development of the concepts presented in the initial proposals. As part of this process, the two submarine designers were required to establish a consortium with at least 50% Australian ownership: IKL/HDW joined with Eglo Engineering to form Australian Marine Systems, while Kockums (which had originally planned to work with Eglo) became part of a joint venture with the Australian branch of Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron, Wormald International, and the Australian Industry Development Corporation to create the Australian Submarine Corporation.

During the study, various accusations of foul play by or unsuitability of both submarine designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, would lead to a pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400 offering.

The Dibb Report on the state of the Australian Defence Force was released in March 1986; it included advice that if the submarine project cost increased too much, the boats&#x27; capabilities should be scaled back to save money. Around the same time, Federal Treasurer Paul Keating began efforts to tighten fiscal policy and cut government spending across all portfolios. Consequently, despite his enthusiastic support for the project as a means to improve Australia&#x27;s defence and industrial capabilities, Minister for Defence Kim Beazley advised the project heads that he would not be able to secure Cabinet approval for construction of the submarines if the predicted cost &quot;started with a 4 [A$4 billion]&quot;.

===Evaluation and final selection===
The four tenders resulting from the study were submitted during October and November 1986. Although the IKL/HDW design was rated highest during the initial inspection, the evaluation team found that the German proposal was less attractive than previously thought. Although IKL/HDW claimed that their boat could meet the RAN&#x27;s performance requirements, the evaluators concluded from the information provided that doing so would require the deactivation of all non-essential and some essential systems. Conversely, Kockums&#x27; proposal conceded that they did not meet the requirements, although evaluators found that the figures failed by only narrow margins, and believed that these were conservative. The evaluation team recalculated the capability statistics for both submarines to a common baseline, portraying the predicted Australian operating conditions, which generally saw Kockums&#x27; figures revised upwards, and those from IKL/HDW downwards. This resulted in growing support for the Type 471 bid, and outcries from the IKL and HDW groups, which questioned the validity of the recalculations and if the Australian evaluators had the experience to do this correctly.
Analysis of the two combat system proposals saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.

On 18 May 1987, the Australian Cabinet approved the final design: Kockums&#x27; Type 471 submarine, fitted with the Rockwell combat system and Diesel-Electric propulsion units provided by the French engineering firm Jeumont-Schneider. The contract for construction of six submarines was signed on 3 June and valued at A$3.9 billion in 1986 prices, with allowances for inflation and the changing value of the Australian dollar. The submarine acquisition project was at the time the most expensive project ever undertaken by the Australian Defence Force, but was unseated from this title by the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate project a few years later.

==Construction==
The Australian Submarine Corporation construction facility was established on previously undeveloped land on the bank of the Port River, at Osborne, South Australia. Work on the site began on 29 June 1987, and it was opened in November 1989. South Australia was selected as the site of the construction facility based on the proposed location of the facility and promises by the State Government to help minimise any problems caused by workers&#x27; unions. The state&#x27;s bid was aided by careful promotion to both Kockums and IKL/HDW during early in the project, and problems with the other states&#x27; proposals: Tasmania and Western Australia lacked the necessary industrial base, New South Wales could not decide on the location of the construction facility, Victoria&#x27;s proposed site was poorly sited, and building in Liberal-led Queensland would have been politically unwise for the project when Labor was in power both federally and in all other states.
Each submarine was constructed in six sections, each consisting of several sub-sections. One of the main criteria of the project was that Australian industries contribute to at least 60% of the work; by the conclusion of the project 70% of the construction and 45% of the software preparation had been completed by Australian-owned companies. Work was sub-contracted out to 426 companies across twelve countries, plus numerous sub-sub-contractors. In many cases, components for the first submarine were constructed by companies outside Australia, while those for the following five boats were replicated by an Australian-owned partner or subsidiary. The project prompted major increases in quality control standards across Australian industries: in 1980, only 35 Australian companies possessed the appropriate quality control certifications for Defence projects, but by 1998 this had increased to over 1,500.

Although the acquisition project organisers originally planned for the first submarine to be constructed overseas, the Cabinet decided as part of the project&#x27;s approval that all six submarines would be built in Australia; the increases in construction time and cost from not building the lead ship in the winning designer&#x27;s home shipyard was considered to be offset by the additional experience provided to Australian industries. Even so, two sections of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums&#x27; shipyard in Malmo, Sweden.

By the end of 1990, Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron and Wormald International had both sold their shares in ASC. The shares were bought up by Kockums and the Australian Industry Development Corporation, with some of Kockums&#x27; shares then sold to James Hardie Industries to maintain an Australian majority ownership of the company. On 5 April 2000, the shares in ASC held by Kockums were bought out and the company was nationalised, despite a trend at the time to privatise government-owned companies. At the end of 2003, a contract to maintain the &quot;Collins&quot; class worth $3.5 billion over 25 years was awarded to ASC.

As of April 1996, the option to order the seventh and eighth submarines was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.

===Entry into service===

The first submarine, , was laid down in February 1990. &quot;Collins&quot;″ launch was originally planned for 1994, but was later set for 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, she was not complete: the design of the submarine had not been finalised, important internal pipes and fittings were not installed, the components of the combat system had yet to be delivered, and some hull sections were actually sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, &quot;Collins&quot; was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that the submarine was completed. Progress on the other five submarines was delayed by the extra effort required to meet &quot;Collins&quot;″ launching date and the subsequent work to complete her. &quot;Collins&quot; was not commissioned into the RAN until 27 July 1996; eighteen months behind schedule, because of several delays and problems, most relating to the provision and installation of the combat data system software. &quot;Collins&quot; was not approved for operational deployments until 2000.

The other five submarines were scheduled for completion at 12-month intervals. However, the series of defects and problems encountered during sea trials of the submarines (particularly &quot;Collins&quot;) resulted in the repeated diversion of resources from those still under construction, adding to delays. Consequently, delivery of the submarines ran significantly behind schedule; submarines were presented to the RAN between 21 and 41 months late, and the entire class was not cleared for full operational service until March 2004, a year after the last boat was commissioned. These delays forced the RAN to keep several &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines and the submarine base HMAS &quot;Platypus&quot; in service beyond their planned decommissioning dates.

===McIntosh-Prescott Report and Fast Track program===
Following his appointment as Minister for Defence following the 1998 federal election, John Moore decided that the only way to solve the various problems of the &quot;Collins&quot; class was for an independent report to be prepared on them. He appointed Malcolm McIntosh, chief executive of the CSIRO and an unofficial advisor to Moore, and John Prescott, a former BHP director, to investigate the project, uncover the problems with the submarines, and suggest ways of solving them.

The &quot;Report to the Minister for Defence on the Collins class submarine and related matters&quot; (commonly referred to as the &quot;McIntosh-Prescott Report&quot;) was compiled in ten weeks, and released on 1 June 1999. This report concluded that the &quot;Collins&quot; class was incapable of performing at the required level for military operations. Although the report highlighted several elements of the submarine design that performed to or beyond expectations, and acknowledged that many of the publicised problems had been or were in the process of being fixed, it presented the propulsion system, combat system, and excessive noise as ongoing problems across the class. After identifying the combat system as the central problem, McIntosh and Prescott recommended that it be scrapped entirely and replaced with a system based on commercially available equipment and software. They also claimed that these problems were caused by poor design and manufacture; inappropriate design requirements; deficiencies in the structure of the contract, particularly with regards to modifying the contract to meet changing requirements; and problems between the various parties involved in the construction of the submarines, with a lack of overall direction and conflicts of interest causing avoidable hostility and uncooperativeness. Despite the report being promoted by the government as &#x27;ground-breaking&#x27;, many people involved with the &quot;Collins&quot;-class project later claimed that large sections of the report could have been copied from reports previously submitted by the RAN or ASC.

The report, along with the planned December 2000 decommissioning of the final &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarine, , prompted the establishment of an A$1 billion program to bring the fourth and fifth submarines ( and ) up to operational standards, then retrofit the modifications to the other boats. Referred to as the &quot;fast track&quot; or &quot;get well&quot; program, the program also included solving the problems preventing various parties from cooperating fully, and improving the negative media coverage and public perception of the class by responding to criticism and providing more information to reporters.

==Submarines in class==
==Problems during construction and trials==
The &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines experienced a wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with few or no problems, while the boats&#x27; maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and low-speed submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had been marked as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, the autopilot (which aboard &quot;Collins&quot; was nicknamed &#x27;Sven&#x27;) was found to be better at maintaining depth during snorting than most helmsmen.

However, problems with the combat system, excessive noise, and engine breakdowns were recurring and appeared across the entire class. These and other shortcomings were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and who was responsible for solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often negative and exaggerated, creating poor public perception. This was aided by politicians, who used the shortcomings to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.

Following the &quot;McIntosh-Prescott Report&quot;, which indicated the long-term faults with the class that still required solving, successful efforts were made to bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the &quot;Collins&quot;-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.

===Welding of &quot;Collins&quot;===
During assembly of &quot;Collins&quot;″ bow and escape tower sections in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered. Different reasons were given by different parties for the problems: To speed production, Kockums employed welders who were not qualified to work on high strength steels; the Qualified Welding Procedures developed by Kockums for these steels were not followed in production; the steel alloy used for the hull required different welding techniques to those normally used by Kockums; the Swedish navy always requested partial penetration welds for their submarines, while the RAN wanted full penetration welding, but had not made this clear; delays in delivering the steel plates to Kockums resulted in rushed work and a resulting drop in quality. Kockums engineers proposed that the section be kept in Sweden for repairs, but to minimise delays it was accepted as-is, with repairs attempted at ASC during full assembly of the first boat. Kockums sent welders and inspection technicians to ASC in order to assist in undertaking these repairs.

However, when &quot;Collins&quot; returned to the ASC facility in April 2001 for a year-long maintenance docking, multiple welding defects were found in the bow and escape tower sections of the submarine (the two sections constructed by Kockums), while almost no problems were found in the welding of the four Australian-built sections. Repairing these welds quadrupled the time &quot;Collins&quot; spent in dock.

===Noise signature===
The noise made by the submarines, which compromised their ability to stay hidden, was another major problem with the design. In the original requisition, the RAN guidelines for the noise signature of the new submarines were vague; for example, asking that they be &quot;twice as quiet&quot; as the &quot;Oberon&quot;s. Expectations and operational requirements also changed between the 1987 contract signing and when the submarines began operating in the late 1990s. The major element of the noise signature for the &quot;Oberon&quot; class was machinery noise transmitted through the hull; this was successfully avoided during construction of the &quot;Collins&quot; class by mounting machinery on platforms isolated from the hull.

Noise testing during 1996 and 1997 found that the hydrodynamic noise signature—the noise made by a submarine passing through the water—was excessive, particularly at high speed. The shape of the hull was the main cause: although a scale model of the design had been tested during the funded study and was found to have a minimal signature, the hull shape was changed after the contract was signed, primarily by a lengthening of the submarine and a redesign of the bow dome to accommodate the larger-than-expected main sonar and reduce its blind spot (the baffles). The design had not been retested, as who would pay for this could not be agreed on. Propeller cavitation, caused by water flow over control surfaces onto the propeller at certain speeds, was the other main noisemaker. Cavitation had not been a problem with earlier Swedish submarine designs or during early testing of the Type 471 design, but the propeller had to be redesigned late in the process to provide more power, and like the redesigned hull, was not retested.

During the year 2000, an unusual meeting took place with a next door neighbor (Francis &#x27;Frank&#x27; Smith) of the then HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot; Naval Base commander. He was an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (originally trained at Government Aircraft Factories Fisherman&#x27;s bend) who had been aware of the fluid dynamics issues of the Collins class for some time, purely by interest and observation on television. After a lengthy discussion, he was invited to discuss and demonstrate where possible, his observations at the &quot;Stirling&quot; Naval Base with Navy and Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) staff who were there at that time as part of an investigative group. He showed on a white board, the aerofoil issue with the Dorsal – Sail conning tower structure showing that the aspect ratio (span (height) to chord (width)) was too short and that severe turbulence / cavitation would be generated by such a design. This was demonstrated again on the white board using aircraft aerofoil wing shapes as a basis for the discussion. That the turbulence / cavitation generated would, by natural rearward flow, move down the rear upper surface deck of the hull and be drawn into the propeller. He was also able to demonstrate that the design of the bow section would not pass a flow test for generated turbulence / cavitation, with the change in shape from circular bow section to long hull, being ill-conceived. He made several recommendations during the lecture that would be cost-effective and possible. 1) To lengthen and taper the dorsal fin and create a more streamlined integration of the dorsal to flat upper Hull deck section. and 2) To &#x27;fill in&#x27; the hollow section of hull aft of the bow curvature. Both these could be achieved with Carbon Fibre or Fibreglass covers as no load bearing strength would be required. Subsequent studies by the DSTO showed that the submarine&#x27;s hull shape, particularly the redesigned sonar dome, the fin, and the rear of the submarine, focused the displaced water into two turbulent streams; when the seven propeller blades hit these streams, the propeller&#x27;s vibration was increased, causing cavitation. These problems were fixed by modifying the casing of the submarine with fiberglass fairings.

===Propulsion system===
During trials of the first submarines, the propulsion system was found to be prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.

Propeller shaft seals were a significant problem on &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Farncomb&quot;. Although designed to allow for a leak of per hour, during trials it was found that the seals would regularly misalign and allow hundreds of litres per hour into the boat—during one deep diving test the flow rate was measured at approximately a minute. ASC claimed that solving these problems could be done by manually adjusting the seals as the submarine dived and rose, but this would have required a sailor dedicated solely to that task, affecting efforts to minimise the required number of personnel. It was found that the problem could be temporarily alleviated by running the propeller in reverse for 100 revolutions, pulling the seal back into alignment, although a permanent solution could initially not be found, as ASC refused to accept responsibility for the problem, and the original manufacturer of the seals had closed down. New suppliers were found, with modified seals fitted to the first two submarines in late 1996, before completely re-designed seals were fitted to the boats in late 1997, solving the problem.

The propellers themselves were also found to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, with at least one cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline after the end of the Cold War, the submarine project office sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of the points of contention in the company&#x27;s legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine&#x27;s design.

Other propulsion problems included excessive motor vibrations at certain speeds which damaged various components (which was attributed to the removal of a flywheel and to corrosion caused by the fuel problems), and excessive fuel consumption in &quot;Collins&quot; at high speed (found to be caused by manufacturing problems with the turbines and turbochargers). The propulsion system was also found to be a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect voltage supply to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the DSTO.

In March 2010, the Department of Defence revealed that the generators in five of the submarines were flawed and had to be replaced. The three generators aboard each of the five submarines are to be replaced in the submarines as they come in for their next maintenance docking.

===Periscopes and masts===
The periscopes had two problems, the first of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).

The periscopes also had problems with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in refocusing after changing magnification, duplication of images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path to be routed around these components. The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem by the time the fast track submarines entered service.

===Combat system===
Despite the public focus on the various physical issues with the boats, the major problem with the submarines was the development of the Rockwell combat system. The problems had started during the funded study, when Singer Librascope and Thomson CSF, who were partnering with Rockwell to develop the combat system, refused to release their intellectual property or their software code for Rockwell to sell. It was proposed that Computer Sciences of Australia, a division of Computer Sciences Corporation and a minor partner in the consortium, take over the role of writing the software for the combat system, although this meant that Singer Librascope, which had prior experience in creating submarine combat systems, was reduced to a minor role in the project. Other major problems with the system, to which most of the later difficulties were attributed, were that the original concept was beyond the technology of the day, and that the system architecture required by the RAN was both overly ambitious and flawed. This was compounded by the rate of advancement in computer technology: equipment had to be designed from scratch and custom manufactured at the start of the project, but by the time these were installed, they were obsolete compared to commercially available hardware and software.

Australian Submarine Corporation was made responsible for the delivery of the Rockwell combat system, but had little ability to enforce this. Rockwell was contracted to deliver the combat system by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC&#x27;s management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of the combat system—referred to as &#x27;releases&#x27; and &#x27;drops&#x27;—until the complete system had been delivered. Sea trials of &quot;Collins&quot; were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of the combat system software was delivered; because of ongoing delays in the provision of the software, the early phases of the trials were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, the combat system had become the major area of concern for the submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% of the software had not been compiled. The combat system continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion date of Release 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of the combat system software—was continually postponed.

In 1996, Rockwell sold its military and aerospace division, including responsibility for the &quot;Collins&quot; combat system, to Boeing. Boeing attempted to produce a workable combat system, but believed that this could only be done if the changes in technology were accounted for in a contract alteration, which the RAN and the Australian Government initially refused to do. Boeing then requested assistance from Raytheon, and after further negotiations with the Government resulted in a reduction of the system capabilities, the companies were able to stabilise the system and deliver Release 2.0 at the end of 1999. Boeing sold its naval systems division to Raytheon in May 2000, making the latter company solely responsible for completion of the combat system. After this, the submarine project began investigating ideas for a new combat system. Because there was not enough time to evaluate the replacement system to include it in the &quot;fast track&quot; program, &quot;Dechaineux&quot; and &quot;Sheean&quot; were fitted with the old Rockwell combat system, which was enhanced by the addition of sub-systems developed during the early 1980s for the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class mid-life upgrade and commercial off-the-shelf components. Even with the enhanced system, it was believed that the capabilities of the fast track &quot;Collins&quot; boats was at best equivalent to the &quot;Oberon&quot;s.
Lockheed Martin, Thales, STN Atlas, and Raytheon were approached to provide tenders to design and assemble a new combat system for the submarines, with all four submitting proposals during early 2000. In May 2000, after the DSTO tested operational versions of the proposed combat software packages, the Lockheed and Thales tenders were eliminated, despite the Thales proposal being rated better than Raytheon&#x27;s. After indepth testing of the remaining systems and observations of the systems in action, the German STN Atlas ISUS 90-55 aboard an Israeli &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarine and the American Raytheon CCS Mk2 aboard a USN &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine, it was decided that the STN Atlas system was the best for the class. However, political pressure from both the United States and Australia, questions about the security problems and possible leaks involved with a European combat system linked to American weapons, and desires to increase the political and military ties between Australia and the United States resulted in the cancellation of the tender program in July 2001 and the decision to enter a joint development program with the United States, with a formal agreement signed on 10 September 2001 at the Pentagon. The replacement program received Australian government approval in September 2002.

The second combat system development program proceeded with far fewer problems, and took the tactical and fire control components from the CCS Mk2 system, and the sonar interface component from the fast track program. The system is the AN/BYG-1 that was developed for the new USN &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine and has since be retrofitted to the whole USN fleet. The first of class installation was &quot;Waller&quot; in 2008 and the final installation was &quot;Collins&quot; in 2018. The program was to be completed by 2010 in conjunction with modifications for the new Mk48 Mod 7 torpedo but was hampered by changes to the maintenance cycle. The system can receive new software releases and hardware can be upgraded with new versions of the system regularly released with the version operated by a boat dependent on its full cycle docking schedule.

===Budget===
Several newspaper articles and commentators have incorrectly claimed that the project ran significantly over the contract cost. As of the launch of the first submarine, the project cost had increased from A$3.892 billion in 1986 dollars to A$4.989 billion in 1993 dollars, which corresponded to the rate of inflation during that period. By 2006, A$5.071 billion had been spent to build the submarines (excluding the fast track program); after taking inflation into account, the project had run less than A$40 million over contract.

Of the A$1.17 billion allocated to the fast track program, only A$143 million was required to fix problems where the submarines did not correspond with the original contract: the rest was used to update components that were technologically obsolete and make changes to the submarines beyond the contract specifications. When the fast track program is factored in, the &quot;Collins&quot; class cost just under 20% more than the inflation-adjusted contract value; a smaller increase than other contemporary defence projects.

==Characteristics==

The &quot;Collins&quot; class is an enlarged version of the Kockums &quot;Västergötland&quot;-class submarine. The design was referred to as the Type 471 Submarine until it was decided to name the lead boat, HMAS &quot;Collins&quot;, after RAN Vice Admiral Sir John Augustine Collins. The names of the six submarines were first announced during &quot;Collins&quot;″ laying down ceremony: &quot;Collins&quot;, &quot;Farncomb&quot;, &quot;Waller&quot;, &quot;Dechaineux&quot;, &quot;Sheean&quot;, and &quot;Rankin&quot;; all named after Australian naval personnel who distinguished themselves during World War II. The &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines are classified by the RAN as SSGs, or guided missile carrying submarines, although some defence industry websites refer to the boats as hunter-killer submarines, or SSKs.

At in length, with a beam of and a waterline depth of , the six boats were the largest conventionally powered submarines in the world at the time of their commissioning. The submarines are single-hulled, and have two continuous decks. Each boat displaces when surfaced, and when submerged. The depth that the submarines can dive to is classified. Following the near-loss of &quot;Dechaineux&quot; in 2003 when a seawater hose burst during a deep dive, the diving depth was reduced.

The hull is constructed from a high-tensile micro-alloy steel, developed by Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB, and improved by BHP of Australia, which was lighter and easier to weld than the HY-80 or HY-100 nickel-alloy steel used in contemporary submarine construction projects, while providing better results in explosion bulge testing. The submarines are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar: &quot;Collins&quot; was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction. These tiles were developed by the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) as the United States and United Kingdom would not share their information on the tiles used on their nuclear submarines, Australian researchers had to develop the tiles from scratch. The tiles were moulded in the shape of the hull, and are secured by a commercial adhesive normally used to fix cat&#x27;s eyes to road surfaces: although British and American submarines are often seen with missing tiles, as of March 2007, none have been lost from a &quot;Collins&quot;-class boat.

===Armament===
The &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines are armed with six torpedo tubes, and carry a standard payload of 22 torpedoes. Originally, the payload was a mixture of Gould Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and UGM-84C Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missiles; previously carried by the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class boats. In 2003, the RAN and the United States Navy signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperatively develop the Mark 48 Mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) torpedo. The first of class boat to be modified for the new torpedo was &quot;Waller&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Collins&quot; was the last boat to be modified in 2018. The modifications were to be completed by 2010. &quot;Waller&quot; was the first vessel of either navy to fire an armed Mod 7, sinking the decommissioned destroyer on 16 July 2008, during RIMPAC 08. 

In lieu of a torpedo payload 44 mines can be carried. The RAN does not identify the mine for security reasons. However, it is widely reported to be the Stonefish Mk III mine. In 2000, the Stonefish Mk III mine was selected under Project 2045 Phase 1A for the RAN and the Royal Australian Air Force. In a project cancelled in 2001, the RAN and the United States Navy were cooperatively developing the Improved Submarine Launched Mobile Mine (ISLMM) Mk 76. The mine was based on the Mark 48 torpedo and was to replace the United States Navy SLMM Mk 67 mine. Under Project SEA 2000, the RAN will acquire RWM Italia smart sea mines with deliveries expected in 2023.

During the construction phase, consideration was given to acquiring submarine-launchable Tomahawk cruise missiles; giving the boats the capability to attack land targets after minor modifications. Plans to acquire Tomahawk or similar land-attack missiles remained under consideration until 2009, when the &quot;Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030&quot; white paper was released; stating that land-attack missiles will instead be incorporated into the armament of the &quot;Collins&quot;-class replacement. In 2022, the RAN said that it was conducting a feasibility study on arming the &quot;Collins&quot;-class with Tomahawk cruise missiles.

===Propulsion===
Each submarine is equipped with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400 kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of modular construction, which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers driven by the exhaust gas. Fifteen fuel tanks are located throughout the submarine: they must be used in specific sequences to preserve the submarine&#x27;s buoyancy and trim.

Electricity is stored in four lead-acid battery packs, totalling 400 tonnes, assembled by Pacific Marine Batteries, a joint venture between VARTA of Germany and Pacific Dunlop of Australia. These supply a single Jeumont Schneider DC motor, which provides 7,200 shaft horsepower to a seven-bladed, diameter skewback propeller. The propeller design is classified Top Secret, and must be covered before a &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine can be removed from the water for maintenance. Emergency propulsion is provided by a MacTaggart Scott DM 43006 retractable hydraulic motor. The aft control surfaces are mounted on an X-shaped structure, giving the boats the ability to outmanoeuvre most warship and submarine classes.
The &quot;Collins&quot; class has a speed of when surfaced and at snorkel depth, and can reach underwater. When travelling at , the submarines have a range of along the surface, or at snorkel depth. When fully submerged, a &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine can travel at . 

Nuclear propulsion was ruled out at an early stage of the project, because supporting nuclear submarines without a nuclear power industry in Australia and public opposition to such infrastructure would be extremely difficult. Air-independent propulsion (AIP) was also considered for the class, and the submarines were designed to be retrofitted with an AIP system. The AIP plan was cancelled in July 1996, after it was demonstrated during sea trials that during constant operations, the boat&#x27;s snorkel was exposed for only a few minutes in a 24-hour period; officials from ASC claimed that any &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine spotted while snorting would be because the boat was &quot;dead unlucky&quot;. Installation of AIP was not believed to provide enough of an improvement on this to justify the predicted A$100 million cost.

===Sensors and systems===
The main sonar array is a Thomson Sintra Scylla active/passive bow sonar, linked to a passive intercept and ranging array distributed along the flanks of the submarine; three panels on each side. &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Farncomb&quot; were originally fitted with Thales Karriwarra passive towed sonar arrays, while the other four boats could be fitted with the Karriwarra or Thales&#x27; Namara array. These were later replaced across the class with the Thales SHOR-TAS towed passive array, deployed through the horizontal &#x27;pipe&#x27; at the stern. When surfaced or at periscope depth, the &quot;Collins&quot;-class boats can use a Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 surface search radar, which is situated in a retractable mast on the fin.
Each submarine is fitted with a CK043 search periscope and CH093 attack periscope. The periscopes were manufactured by Pilkington Optronics (now Thales Optronics), and experienced several problems early in the submarines&#x27; service lives. In 2022, Safran was selected to replace the CK043 with their Series 30 search optronic mast. &quot;Rankin&quot; is scheduled to be fitted with the optronic mast in 2024.

The hardware for the original combat system was based around the Motorola 68000 family of processors. The replacement combat system consists of the tactical and fire control components from the Raytheon CCS Mk2 system, combined with the sonar interfaces developed for the improved combat system used aboard &quot;Sheean&quot; and &quot;Dechaineux&quot;. Countermeasures include a Condor CS-5600 ESM intercept and warning unit, and two SSE decoys. The boats are fitted with a Marconi SDG-1802 degaussing system, and a receive-only Link 11 combat information exchange datalink. In October 2006, Sagem Défense Sécurité was selected to fit the &quot;Collins&quot; class with SIGMA 40XP gyrolaser inertial navigation systems.

===Special forces support===
The &quot;Collins&quot; class was not designed to support special forces operations providing a limited capability similar to the &quot;Oberon&quot; class. In 2005, &quot;Collins&quot; received a special forces upgrade to provide three capabilities of multi swimmer release, float on/float off and exit and reentry. However, there were issues with exit and reentry during sea trials. Originally only one submarine was planned to receive the upgrade. In 2014, &quot;Dechaineux&quot; was upgraded and the issue with exit and reentry was rectified. &quot;Collins&quot; is scheduled on its next maintenance docking to receive the safety upgrade for exit and reentry. However, the full special forces upgrade is yet to be reached with outboard stowage of equipment, such as for inflatable boats, still in the design phase.

===Ship&#x27;s company===
Originally, the standard complement of each submarine was six officers and thirty-six sailors, with facilities to carry an additional twelve personnel (usually trainees). This number was minimised by the RAN during design, which insisted that functions be automated where possible; the RAN also requiring that each sailor have his own rack and did not need to &#x27;hot bunk&#x27;. It was originally intended that multiple ship&#x27;s companies be established per submarine, and that these be rotated to maximise the submarines&#x27; time at sea without adversely affecting personnel, but difficulties in maintaining submariner numbers made this plan unworkable. Enlisted submariners are accommodated in six-bunk cabins.
In May 1997, two groups of six female sailors were posted to &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Farncomb&quot; to test the feasibility of mixed-sex submarine companies. Following the trial&#x27;s success, eleven female sailors and one female officer commenced submarine training in 1998. Officers and senior enlisted submariners slept in mixed accommodation, but junior enlisted submariners could be deployed in groups of only six: one of the enlisted cabins was set aside, and all six bunks in the cabin had to be filled. Mixed accommodation for all female submariners was approved in June 2011, in order to increase posting opportunities and help make up shortfalls in submarine complements.

During the late 1990s, a combination of low recruitment and retention rates across the RAN resulted in the number of trained submariners falling below 40% of that required. As an attempt to retain submariners, the RAN offered a one-off A$35,000 bonus in 1999. Other measures introduced around the same time included priority transfer of volunteers for submarine training and rotating submariners between sea and shore assignments to relieve them from continual sea service and prevent burnout. A year later, these measures had increased submariner numbers to 55% of requirements.

However, the problem with submarine crewing continued; by 2008 the RAN could provide complete companies for only three of the six submarines. A review by Rear Admiral Rowan Moffitt during 2008 (the &quot;Submarine Workforce Sustainability Review&quot; or &quot;Moffitt Report&quot;) found that poor leadership and a culture of &quot;mission achievement at almost any cost&quot; resulted in submariners who were regularly stressed and fatigued from working for up to 22 hours in a stretch, under conditions worse than those experienced by the Special Air Service during the Afghanistan conflict. Submariners were also found to have lower morale and job satisfaction levels than any other position in the RAN, with these factors combining to cause a high rate of personnel burnout, while resignations meant that the average experience level in those remaining decreased. The report, publicly released in April 2009, made 29 recommendations to improve conditions and stabilise or increase submariner numbers; all of which the RAN agreed to adopt. These measures included increasing each boat&#x27;s complement to 58 to spread workload (a practice successfully employed aboard &quot;Farncomb&quot; since December 2008), reducing the length of patrols and increasing shore leave, paying bonuses for submariners who remain in the submarine service for at least eighteen months, and providing internet access aboard the submarines. A dedicated recruiting program was also suggested, promoting the submarine service as an elite unit, and targeting RAN personnel aboard surface ships, former submariners whose civilian jobs may have been affected by the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and submariners in foreign navies. The program was successful; by June 2010, three expanded ship&#x27;s companies were active, while a fourth was undergoing training. By December 2012, the fourth company was active, and was preparing to bring a submarine out of deep maintenance in 2013.

===Sustainment, maintenance and upgrade===
The &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines are maintained at the ASC North facility at Osbourne in South Australia and at the ASC West facility at Henderson in Western Australia. The maintenance cycle for the submarines known as a Usage Upkeep Cycle was initially six years in operational service then a nineteen month major overhaul and refit at Osbourne known as a full cycle docking (FCD), and in between, at Henderson a four month mid cycle docking (MCD) and two two and half month intermediate dockings (ID). The cycle was later changed to eight years in operational service with a three year FCD, six month MCD and one three month ID. In 2013, the government adopted the 2012 Coles Report recommendation to change the cycle to ten years in operational service with a two year FCD, a twelve month MCD and one six month ID. During these dockings, the submarines are fitted with any enhancements or new technologies as part of the Collins Continuous Improvement Program (part of Defence procurement project SEA 1439).

The sustainment, maintenance and upgrade of the &quot;Collins&quot;-class fleet underwent a Federal Government-commissioned root-and-branch review from 2011 by Dr John Coles, and major reforms were instituted in the following years, including an innovation program across deep maintenance operations at ASC in Osborne. ASC later was recognised by Engineers Australia with an award for the innovation and effectiveness of its improvements to Collins sustainment.

The result of the system-wide reform by the Submarine Enterprise has been a &quot;dramatic turnaround&quot; in submarine availability for the RAN and the &quot;Collins&quot;-class program performing as an &quot;exemplar&quot;.

The latest review by Dr Coles found that ASC and the Submarine Enterprise were achieving submarine sustainment and availability at or exceeding international benchmarks.

==Operations and deployments==
The entire class is based at , also known as Fleet Base West, which is located on Garden Island, off the coast of Western Australia. The decision to locate all six submarines at &quot;Stirling&quot; was prompted by the lack of suitable long-term facilities on the east coast of Australia (although individual submarines can use Fleet Base East in Sydney Harbour as a forward staging facility), and the proximity to Australian offshore interests, including most of the nation&#x27;s external territories, the oil and natural gas resources of the North West Shelf, and the Indian Ocean sea lines of communication, through which the majority of Australia&#x27;s seaborne trade passes. The submarines&#x27; primary missions are patrolling the waters of Australia and nearby nations, and gathering intelligence through the interception of electronic communications by foreign nations and the deployment/retrieval of special forces operatives.
===Operational history===
Two boats, including &quot;Waller&quot;, reportedly operated in support of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) in 1999 providing an escort for transport ships and monitored Indonesian communications. 
During several multinational exercises and wargames, the &quot;Collins&quot; class has demonstrated its effectiveness in the hunter-killer role by successfully attacking both surface warships and other submarines. In late May 2000, &quot;Waller&quot; became the first Australian submarine to operate as a fully integrated component of a USN carrier battle group during wargames. &quot;Waller&quot;″s role was to search for and engage opposing submarines hunting the aircraft carrier , a role in which she performed better than expected. A few days later, as part of the multinational exercise RIMPAC 2000, &quot;Waller&quot; was assigned to act as an &#x27;enemy&#x27; submarine, and was reported to have successfully engaged two USN nuclear submarines before almost coming into attacking range of &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. &quot;Waller&quot; performed similarly during the Operation Tandem Thrust wargames in 2001, when she &#x27;sank&#x27; two USN amphibious assault ships in waters just over deep, although the submarine was &#x27;destroyed&#x27; herself later in the exercise. &quot;Waller&quot;″s second feat was repeated by &quot;Sheean&quot; during RIMPAC 02, when the boat was able to penetrate the air and surface anti-submarine screens of an eight-ship amphibious task force, then successfully carry out simulated attacks on both the amphibious assault ship and the dock landing ship .

Later that year, during two weeks of combat trials in August, &quot;Sheean&quot; demonstrated that the class was comparable in the underwater warfare role to the &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class nuclear-powered attack submarine . The two submarines traded roles during the exercise and were equally successful in the attacking role, despite &quot;Olympia&quot; being larger, more powerful, and armed with more advanced torpedoes. In 2003, a &quot;Collins&quot;-class boat carried out successful attacks on two USN nuclear submarines and an aircraft carrier during a multinational exercise. The repeated successes of the class in wargames and multinational exercises earned the &quot;Collins&quot; class praise from foreign military officers for being &quot;a very capable and quiet submarine&quot;, and recognition of the boats as a clear example of the threat posed to navies by modern diesel submarines.

On 12 February 2003, &quot;Dechaineux&quot; was operating near her maximum safe diving depth off the coast of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented &quot;Dechaineux&quot; from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.
On 10 June 2005, &quot;Rankin&quot; became the first submarine since in 1987 to receive the Gloucester Cup, an award presented to the RAN vessel with the greatest overall efficiency during the previous year. The award was subsequently presented to &quot;Sheean&quot; in 2006, and again to &quot;Rankin&quot; in 2008.

In March 2007, &quot;Farncomb&quot; had an emergency when crew were washed overboard while attempting to remove fishing line from the propeller. The boat was reportedly conducting surveillance on Chinese Navy submarines in the South China Sea.

In 2008 and 2009, personnel shortages reduced the number of submarines able to be deployed to three; the maintenance cycles of &quot;Sheean&quot;, &quot;Rankin&quot;, and &quot;Dechaineux&quot;, and problems with &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Waller&quot; further reducing this to one, &quot;Farncomb&quot;, in mid-2009. &quot;Farncomb&quot; was docked for repair after a generator malfunction in February 2010, by which point &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Waller&quot; were active (the former on limited duties because of defects), and &quot;Dechaineux&quot; was slated to re-enter service by May 2010. Workforce shortages and malfunctions on other submarines during the preceding two years impacted heavily on the maintenance of &quot;Sheean&quot; and &quot;Rankin&quot;, with RAN and ASC officials predicting that they would not be active until 2012 and 2013, respectively. In June 2011, &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper claimed despite two submarines (&quot;Waller&quot; and &quot;Dechaineux&quot;) designated as operational, neither was in sailable condition. The initial findings from the Coles Review revealed significant, systemic problems with the submarines and noted the need for their management to be reformed. A 2014 statement by Vice Admiral Ray Griggs indicated that up to four submarines had been operational on most occasions since 2012.

==Replacement==

The submarines originally had a predicted operational life of around 30 years, with &quot;Collins&quot; to decommission around 2025. The Submarine Institute of Australia released a report in July 2007 arguing that planning for the next generation of Australian submarines had to begin soon. In December 2007, shortly after the 2007 federal election, the Australian government announced that planning for a &quot;Collins&quot;-class replacement (procurement project SEA 1000) had commenced. The 2009 &quot;Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030&quot; white paper confirmed the replacement project, and announced that the submarine fleet would be increased to twelve vessels to sustain submarine operations in any conflict, and counter the growing potency of Asian-Pacific naval forces.

The 2009 white paper outlined the replacement submarine as a 4,000-ton vessel fitted with land-attack cruise missiles in addition to torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, capable of launching and recovering covert operatives while submerged, and carrying surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment. The project initially had four options: a Military-Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) design without modification, a MOTS design modified for Australian conditions, an evolution of an existing submarine, or a newly designed submarine. Nuclear propulsion was ruled out because of the lack of nuclear infrastructure and public opposition to nuclear technology. Designs initially considered for purchase or modification included the Spanish , the French-designed , the German-designed Type 214, and Japan&#x27;s , along with an evolution of the &quot;Collins&quot;.

There were long delays in organising the replacement project. Originally, preliminary designs were to be established for selection by 2013, with detailed design work completed by 2016. However, meetings to clarify concepts and intended capabilities did not occur until March 2012, and initial design phase funding was not approved until May 2012, pushing construction start out to 2017. By November 2014, initial capabilities still had not been decided on, with recommendations to be made across 2015. The best case prediction for seeing the first new submarine enter service, made in 2012, was &quot;after 2030&quot;, with the lack of decision making partly attributed to politicians fearing being held responsible for a repeat of the issues surrounding the &quot;Collins&quot; class.

Throughout 2014, there was increasing speculation that the &quot;Sōryū&quot; class (or a derivative) was the most likely candidate for the replacement. Defence technology sharing deals between Japan and Australia, along with the loosening of Japanese defence export restrictions, were seen as preliminary steps towards such a deal. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was also cited as a factor in the likeliness of such a deal. In response to the rumours of the Japanese deal, unsolicited proposals were made by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (its Type 216 submarine concept), Saab (an enlarged version of the A26 submarine), and Thales and DCNS (a diesel-electric variant of the Barracuda-class submarine).

In January 2015, a three-way &quot;competitive evaluation process&quot; between the Japanese proposal, ThyssenKrupp&#x27;s plan, and the Thales-DCNS offer was announced. A 2012 study of the &quot;Collins&quot; class concluded that the submarines&#x27; lifespan could be extended by one maintenance cycle (seven years) to cover any capability gap, with lead submarine &quot;Collins&quot; to be retired in the early 2030s.

On 26 April 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the Shortfin Barracuda by French firm DCNS as the winner.

On 15 September 2021, news came out that, following the signing of a new trilateral security partnership named AUKUS between Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, which would include alignment of technologies, the troubled &quot;Attack&quot;-class programme would be cancelled, with Australia instead investing in the procurement of new nuclear-powered submarines, which would incorporate existing American and British technology.

<text>Technikum is an institute of vocational education in Poland.

It is a mass-education institution of &quot;special middle education&quot; category 1 step higher than PTU, but aimed to train low and middle level (depending on profile) industrial managers, foremen, coordinators, technical supervisors etc. or specializing in occupations that require skills more advanced than purely manual labor, especially in high-tech occupations (such as electronics). After graduation from a technikum/college, a student may apply to an institution of higher learning (i.e. university) as a freshman.

==Poland==
A student finishing the 8th year of compulsory education (primary school) has to choose between three types of schools:
* Liceum ogólnokształcące (high school, 4 years), designed mainly for those who want to pass matura and begin higher studies,
* Branżowa szkoła I stopnia (vocational school, 3 years), designed for those who want to start working immediately after finishing their compulsory education
* Technikum (professional technical school, 5 years), after which students have both qualifications to start working and possibility to pass matura and begin studies.
People who have completed a technikum and passed the final exams (organized by an external, state unit - &quot;Centralna Komisja Egzaminacyjna&quot; - &quot;Central Examination Board&quot;) in their profession obtain a title consisting of the word &quot;technik&quot; and the profession they have learnt (for example &quot;technik elektryk&quot; - &quot;electrical industry technician&quot;), where the word &quot;technician&quot; (&quot;technik&quot;) cannot be used by those who finished three-year vocational school. Their title contains only the name of profession, for example &quot;elektryk&quot; (&quot;electrician&quot;).

<doc id="810769" wikidata="Q1683230" url="?curid=810769" title="University of Greater Manchester">
<text>The University of Greater Manchester (legally: The University of Bolton Higher Education Corporation) is a public university in Bolton, Greater Manchester in England. The university is commonly referred to as a &#x27;post-92&#x27; institution, which is a reference to the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. It has approximately 11,000 students and more than 900 academic and professional staff. 

It is a member of Universities UK, Million+, and the All-Party Parliamentary University Group. 

==History==
The University of Greater Manchester traces its origins back to 1824 with the founding of &#x27;Bolton Mechanics&#x27; Institute. In 1887, the Committee of the Mechanics&#x27; Institute decided that the town&#x27;s apprentices required technical instruction for the rapidly expanding engineering advances being made at the turn of the 19th century. That resulted in the creation of the new Technical School with student numbers rising to more than 1,500.

In 1926, Bolton Technical School became a college. Fifteen years later, a new building was opened offering a wide range of technical education choices, with engineering the most popular. In 1964, Bolton Technical College and the Bolton Institute of Technology were divided into two separate organisations. A. J. Jenkinson was principal of the Technical College, Bolton College of Education (Technical), and then the first principal of Bolton Institute of Technology.

Bolton Institute of Higher Education (BIHE) was formed in 1982 by the merger of the Bolton Institute of Technology and Bolton College of Education. The first principal of BIHE was John McKenzie, who was succeeded by Bob Oxtoby. Oxtoby began the campaign for university status. The university gained its degree awarding powers in 1990. An £8.3 million extension project began in 1991 with the purchase of the former Eagle Factory. Bolton Institute was awarded the right to award taught degrees in 1992, with the powers to award research degrees in 1996. In 1998, Mollie Temple became the third principal and successfully led the institution to achieve university status in 2004.

In November 2014, it became the first university in the North West to become a Living Wage employer. In 2023, the University of Bolton applied to change its name to the University of Greater Manchester, pending a consultation period. The current Vice-Chancellor has claimed that potential employers of graduates are prejudiced because Bolton was not widely known.

==Campus==
The university is primarily situated on an urban campus between Deane Road and Derby Street in Bolton. There are two halls of residence, although the university intends to relocate all services on to a single site in the centre of Bolton.
There is an academic centre in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates.

===Facilities===

====Senate House====
Formally known as Deane Tower, Senate House underwent refurbishment in 2004 to become a centre for design disciplines, research, and consultancy services.

====The Chancellor&#x27;s Building====
After the remodelling and centralisation of the university campus in 2007, a new £2.5 million Social Learning Zone for student study and Students&#x27; Union bar was built.
The building also houses the university library, student services and coffee shop.

====Eagle Tower====
The five-storey building houses academic offices and subject areas including art &amp; design, photography, graphics, media studies, special &amp; visual effects, and psychology.

====Bolton One====
The Bolton One facility is a £31 million, three-way partnership with Bolton Council and NHS Bolton situated on the university&#x27;s campus. The university contributed around £7 million to the development. The purpose-built centre houses new health, science and sports teaching and research facilities – as well as a sports complex.

====Halls of residence====
The university has approved and recommends Orlando Village halls of residence, which is owned by McComb Bolton Limited.

Other accommodation is provided by private landlords. The &quot;Cube&quot; on Bradshawgate was one such building; it was seriously damaged by fire in November 2019. Eyewitnesses say that the cladding on the building encouraged the spread of the fire. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham said, &quot;It does have a type of cladding which does cause concern. There will be many people living in buildings with this cladding today who will be very worried.&quot;

====University Collegiate School====

UTC Bolton, a university technical college sponsored by the University of Bolton, was established at the university campus in September 2015. In November 2015, the UTC was officially opened by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and named the &#x27;Stoller Building&#x27; after the philanthropist Sir Norman Stoller. In September 2020, the school was renamed University Collegiate School. It is now a full secondary school sponsored by the university.

====Growth and future plans====
The university has also announced plans for a new £10 million facility for Science and Engineering, which will house its Centre for Advanced Performance Engineering. Construction was set to begin following the completion of the UTC building in September 2015. There was also to be a renovation and expansion of the current campus through to 2017.

In 2015, the university and Bolton Council announced plans for a new £40 million student village, which was planned to accommodate up to 850 students in the heart of Bolton town centre, facing the iconic Le Mans Crescent.

====International presence====
The university has an academic centre in Ras al-Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates and established international links with a number of overseas academic establishments in China, Germany, Greece, Malawi, Malaysia, and Singapore.

Since 2009, the University of Bolton has had a partnership with Western International College Ras Al Khaimah with programmes available at Undergraduate and Postgraduate level.
In December 2011, the University of Bolton launched its academic centre in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in partnership with the KES Group of Institutions. The university has a memorandum of understanding with the University of the Republic of San Marino, which promotes cooperation between the two institutions.

===Steam hammer on Deane Campus===

The University of Bolton&#x27;s Deane Campus hosts a 50-ton steam hammer, a significant artefact representing Bolton&#x27;s industrial heritage, used at Thomas Walmsley&#x27;s Atlas Forge. 

The steam hammer was originally stationed at the Atlas Forge, located at the intersection of Bridgeman Street and Fletcher Street. It played a role in the forge&#x27;s manufacturing processes, primarily reshaping white-hot iron billets into materials prepared for further refinement through rollers. During the 1960s and early 1970s, it was operated by a former steam train driver who transitioned to the steam hammer operator role after the closure of the nearby railway line connecting Bolton to Daubhill railway station which is now closed as well.

==Organisation and administration==

===Chancellors===
* 2010–2014: Patricia Morris, Baroness Morris of Bolton

==Academic profile==

===Reputation and rankings===
&quot;The Times&quot; said in 2008 that &quot;the university is not research-driven, but engineering, architecture and the built environment, social work and social policy all contained some &#x27;world-leading&#x27; research in the 2008 assessments&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the University of Bolton as #38 in the United Kingdom in 2023 and #6 based on students&#x27; satisfaction with teaching.

==Student life==
The University of Bolton has a diverse student population. About 13% of home students are from ethnic minority communities, with about 7% of its students being classed as international. That portion of students come from 70 countries outside the UK. The university also has a chaplaincy accommodating several different faiths.

===Cycling===
In June 2020, the University of Bolton launched a bike offer scheme in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The university purchased one thousand bicycles and loaned them to students for commuting during the pandemic. 

The university also organised cycling &quot;refresher&quot; sessions for interested students, aiming to promote safety and physical activity. The university&#x27;s vice-chancellor posited that in addition to cycling&#x27;s environmental impact, the scheme would help address students&#x27; concerns about public transport during the pandemic and foster physical well-being.
===Students&#x27; Union===
The main Students&#x27; Union (SU) building is on Deane Road at the centre of the University Campus. As well as being home to the SU bar (The Vista) and the hub of many social events, the union provides numerous other roles such as student support and advice (The Advice Unit), representation and sports societies.

===Sport===
Bolton has many different sports teams competing in the BUCS leagues. Teams include: basketball, netball, football, hockey, rugby league, and rugby union.

Bolton One also offers students an eight-lane, 25-metre competition swimming pool, 50 foot climbing wall and sports hall.

==Sponsorship==
On 17 February 2016, it was announced that the University of Bolton would become the principal shirt sponsors of the Manchester Giants basketball team for the 2016 season. On 2 April 2016, the University again became the sponsors of Bolton Wanderers in an agreement which was initially planned to last until Summer 2016. Bolton Wanderers&#x27; stadium remained The University of Bolton Stadium until 2023 when it became the Toughsheet Community Stadium.

<text>Snake Alley is a street located in Burlington, Iowa, which was built in 1894. In 2017, Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! recognized the street as &quot;Unbelievably Crooked&quot; and the #1 Odd Spot in their Odd Spots Across America Campaign.

==History==
The physical limitations and steep elevation of Heritage Hill inspired the construction of Snake Alley in 1894. It was intended to link the downtown business district and the neighborhood shopping area located on North Sixth Street, of which Snake Alley is a one-block section. Three German immigrants conceived and carried out the idea of a winding hillside street, similar to vineyard paths in France and Germany: Charles Starker, an architect and landscape engineer; William Steyh, the city engineer; and George Kriechbaum, a paving contractor. The street was completed in 1898, but was not originally named Snake Alley, as it was considered part of North Sixth Street; some years later, a resident noted that it reminded him of a snake winding its way down the hill, and the name stuck.

The alley originally provided a shortcut from Heritage Hill to the business district. Bricks were laid at an angle to allow horses better footing as they descended. Unfortunately, riding horses back up the alley often resulted in a loss of control at the top; for this reason, even to this day, Snake Alley remains a one-way street, with all traffic heading downhill.

In the 1940s, writer Robert L. Ripley saw the street in person, and decided to add it to his Ripley&#x27;s Believe It, Or Not! column, calling it &quot;The Crookedest Street in the World&quot;. The turns on Snake Alley are sharper than San Francisco’s famous Lombard Street, giving it a total of 1100° of turning from end to end, where Lombard Street&#x27;s straighter curves total only 1000°.

The alley is composed of limestone and blueclay bricks. The constantly changing slant from one curve to the next necessitated a complicated construction technique to keep the high grade to the outside. Snake Alley consists of five half-curves and two quarter-curves over a distance of , rising , a 21% grade, from Washington Street to Columbia.

The street is the site of an annual uphill bike race, the Snake Alley Criterium. There is also an art fair, the Snake Alley Art Fair, sponsored by the Art Center of Burlington. There is also the annual Snake Alley Festival of Film where filmmakers from around the world gather to compete in the various categories for the awards.

<doc id="810783" wikidata="Q888248" url="?curid=810783" title="Bob Shamansky">
<text>Robert Norton Shamansky (April 18, 1927 – August 11, 2011) was an American Democratic politician and attorney from the state of Ohio. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives for a single term from 1981 until 1983. In 2018, the &quot;Jewish Telegraphic Agency&quot; wrote that &quot;Shamansky&#x27;s life was marked by hardship, Jewish pride and tilting at windmills&quot;.

==Early life==
Shamansky was born in 1927 in Columbus, the son of Sarah (Greenberg) and Harry Solomon Shamansky. He attended Bexley High School. He was a 1947 graduate of Ohio State University and a 1950 graduate of Harvard Law School. He was subsequently admitted to the bar in 1950. He was also a Special Agent in the United States Army&#x27;s Counter Intelligence Corps from 1950 until 1952. He joined the Army as a private and was initially stationed in Georgia, followed by duty at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland.

==Political career==
In 1966, Shamansky ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. However, he lost to Republican incumbent Samuel L. Devine.

=== Congress ===
Fourteen years later, in 1980, Shamansky challenged Devine again. This time, he was successful in unseating the long-time incumbent Devine, becoming the first Democrat to represent the district since 1939. He was also the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of the state capital, Columbus, since 1967.

As a member of the 97th Congress, Shamansky served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and as a member of the Science and Technology Committee.

=== Defeat ===
In 1982, after reapportionment, Shamansky&#x27;s district absorbed a large chunk of the more Republican-leaning 17th District. He was defeated in his bid for re-election by future Governor of Ohio John Kasich.

In 2006, Shamansky ran for his old congressional seat. However, the 12th had been significantly redrawn since he&#x27;d last served in Congress, and he lost to Kasich&#x27;s successor, Pat Tiberi, by 14 points.

==Death==
On August 11, 2011, Shamansky died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Columbus at the age of 84. He had been treated for depression at a psychiatric hospital shortly before his death.

<text>Samuel Leeper Devine (December 21, 1915 – June 27, 1997) was an American politician of the Republican Party who served in the United States House of Representatives as Representative of the 12th congressional district of Ohio from January 3, 1959, until January 3, 1981; he left office after being defeated by Democrat Bob Shamansky, who lost the seat after a single term to Republican John Kasich. During the 96th Congress, he was the Chairman of the House Republican Conference.

==Early life==

Samuel L. Devine was born in South Bend, Indiana, on December 21, 1915, and his family moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 1920. He attended Upper Arlington High School. Devine attended Colgate University from 1933 to 1934 and the Ohio State University from 1934 to 1937. After graduating from OSU, Devine went to law school at the University of Notre Dame (located in the city of his birth) and received an LL.B. and J.D. in 1940.

== Career ==
Devine was admitted to the bar in 1940 and began private legal practice in Columbus, but in 1940 was appointed a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He resigned from the Bureau in October 1945 and resumed private practice in Columbus.

Devine embarked on a political career in 1950 and was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served from 1951 to 1955. Devine was chairman of the Ohio Un-American Activities Committee, a joint committee of the Ohio House and the Senate modelled on the federal House Un-American Activities Committee. This committee, given extensive powers of interrogation, declared in 1952 that approximately 1,300 Ohioans were members of the Communist Party. At Devine&#x27;s urging, the state legislature overrode a gubernatorial veto of a bill to impose prison terms and fines on Communists.

Devine served as Prosecuting Attorney for Franklin County, Ohio, from 1955 until 1958, when he was elected to the United States Congress.

Devine was also a college football official for 27 years.

== Death and legacy ==

He died on June 27, 1997, from cancer in Upper Arlington, Ohio.

His daughter, Carol Miller, is a former Republican member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, where she served as majority whip. In 2018, Miller was elected to Congress from West Virginia&#x27;s 3rd congressional district over Democrat Richard Ojeda in one of the most-watched races in the country.

<doc id="810790" wikidata="Q6197272" url="?curid=810790" title="Jim Oberweis">
<text>James D. Oberweis (born June 10, 1946) is an American businessman, investment manager, and politician from the state of Illinois. The former owner of Oberweis Dairy in North Aurora near Chicago, he served as a member of the Illinois Senate, representing the 25th district from 2013 to 2021.

Oberweis has been a perennial candidate for higher office. He sought the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 2002 and 2004, and the Republican nomination for Governor of Illinois in 2006. He was the Republican nominee for Illinois&#x27;s 14th congressional district in a March 2008 special election and the November 2008 general election, losing on both occasions to Democrat Bill Foster. In 2012, Oberweis was first elected to the Illinois Senate in the 25th district. He again ran for the U.S. Senate in 2014, losing to Democratic incumbent Dick Durbin. In 2020, Oberweis ran for a third time in the 14th congressional district, this time losing to Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood.

==Education==
After graduating from Marmion Academy in Aurora, Illinois, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he joined Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He spent a year abroad, studying at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Illinois, and then a Master of Business Administration from the University of Chicago.

==Career==
In 1968, Oberweis became a junior high school teacher at Waldo Junior High in Aurora, teaching math and science. In 1970, he changed careers and became an investment stockbroker. Within a few years, he was promoted to manager of a branch office.

In 1976, he began publication of an investment newsletter, the &quot;Oberweis Report&quot;, which reported on emerging growth companies. The &quot;Report&quot; was rated highly among investment advice newsletters. In 1978, Oberweis and his first wife, Elaine, established their own investment management company, Oberweis Securities in Aurora, Illinois.

In 1986, Oberweis purchased and assumed control of family business Oberweis Dairy. His father, Joe, had died in 1984, and Joe&#x27;s successor (and Jim&#x27;s older brother) John suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1986; after Jim&#x27;s purchase he turned day-to-day operations over to outside presidents who embarked on acquisition programs highly leveraged with debt. Elaine Oberweis (University of Chicago MBA &#x27;89) left the brokerage business in 1989 to rescue the dairy business from near-ruin.

He remained active in the investment field. In 1987, he founded &quot;Oberweis Emerging Growth Fund&quot;. In 1989, he established Oberweis Asset Management (OAM). OAM specializes in &quot;small-cap growth equities investing&quot;, and has individual accounts for institutional investors and a family of mutual funds for individual investors. As of 2015, OAM had about $2 billion under management.

Oberweis moved the Oberweis Dairy from Aurora to its present location in North Aurora. He also began a chain of company-owned dairy stores, and has maintained a dairy delivery business to homes in the Chicago area. A franchise program began in 2004, to expand the dairy business outside of northeast Illinois.

==Television==
Oberweis became a financial news anchor and host of the show &quot;Catching Winners Early&quot; on the Financial News Network. In Chicago, Oberweis became a regular guest on the &quot;Ask an Expert&quot; show. Oberweis was also a popular guest on CNBC, CNN, and Bloomberg TV.

==Political activity==
Oberweis has sought elective office seven times, succeeding in the 2012 race for the 25th State Senate district seat. His record of unsuccessful election campaigns earned him the nickname of &quot;the Milk Dud&quot;.

===2002 U.S. Senate election===

In 2002, Oberweis sought the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator, but lost in the primary, finishing second of three with 31%.

===2004 U.S. Senate election===

Oberweis ran for Senator again in 2004, but again lost in the primary, finishing second of seven with 24%.

Soon after the primary, the winner, Jack Ryan withdrew due to personal scandal. Some Republicans felt that as the second-place finisher, Oberweis should replace Ryan, but the state central committee chose Alan Keyes instead. Keyes lost to Barack Obama by the largest margin for the Illinois U.S. Senate race in history.

Oberweis&#x27;s 2004 campaign was notable for a television commercial in which he flew in a helicopter over Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field and claimed enough illegal immigrants came into America in a week (10,000 a day) to fill the stadium&#x27;s 61,500 seats.

During his 2004 Senate campaign, Oberweis appeared in television commercials for Oberweis Dairies. The Federal Election Commission ruled that this was an improper corporate contribution to the campaign, and fined Oberweis $21,000 for violation of campaign finance law.

===2006 gubernatorial election===

In 2006, Oberweis sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Illinois. He started his campaign in April 2005. He lost in the primary, finishing second of five with 32%. As part of his campaign, he supported amending the Illinois Constitution to define marriage as opposite-sex only. The winner of the primary was Judy Baar Topinka, who was defeated by Democrat Rod Blagojevich in the general election 49.8%–39.3%, with Rich Whitney, the Green Party candidate, receiving a little over 10.3%.

===2008 congressional elections===

When U.S. Representative Dennis Hastert resigned his seat (Illinois&#x27;s 14th congressional district) on November 26, 2007, Oberweis ran to replace him. Oberweis was endorsed by Hastert. He won the primary for the special election for the remainder of Hastert&#x27;s unfinished term with 56%. He also won the primary for the general election for the next term, with 58%.

However, Oberweis lost the March special election to Democrat Bill Foster, getting 47% of the vote to Foster&#x27;s 53%. He lost to Foster again in November, 58% to 42%.

===Illinois Republican Party State Central Committee===
During the elections for the State Central Committee in March 2010, Jim Oberweis ran and won a seat on the Illinois Republican Party&#x27;s State Central Committee representing the 14th Congressional District. In 2013, as State Central Committeeman, Oberweis led the effort to oust former Illinois Republican Party Chairman Pat Brady after his controversial public support of same-sex marriage. While Oberweis&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful, Brady eventually resigned because of the controversy.

Oberweis did not run again for the State Central Committee for the election in April 2014.

===State senate===
In the 2012 general election, Oberweis won the 25th State Senate seat previously held by Chris Lauzen, his former GOP primary rival in the 2008 congressional race. He had announced his bid in September 2011. He defeated his Democratic opponent, Corinne Pierog, 57.5%–42.5%. In the 2016 general election, Oberweis again defeated Pierog, this time 54.7%–45.3%.

In October 2018, Oberweis was appointed as the Senate Republican Whip. He did not run for re-election in 2020.

====Committee assignments====
* Commerce and Economic Development
* Environment and Conservation (Minority Spokesperson)
* Executive
** Subcommittee on Election Law
* Labor (Minority Spokesperson)
* Revenue
* Transportation; Subcommittee on Election Law
** Subcommittee on Capital

===2014 U.S. Senate election===

Oberweis was the Republican nominee for the 2014 Senate election, for the seat held by Democrat Dick Durbin. He defeated Doug Truax in the Republican primary with 56% of the vote. He was defeated by Durbin in the November election.

===2020 congressional elections===

Oberweis announced he would run again for Illinois&#x27;s 14th congressional district, challenging Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood. On March 17, 2020, he won the Republican nomination, narrowly defeating six other candidates including fellow state Senator Sue Rezin, and businesswoman Catalina Lauf.

On November 4, Oberweis, leading by less than 900 votes in the incomplete vote count, declared himself the victor. This came despite the fact that the race had not been called by media outlets and there were still thousands of uncounted mail-in ballots. That same day, Oberweis began sending out fundraising appeals to fund fees associated with a potential recount.

On November 12, the race was called by the Associated Press for Underwood. Oberweis did not concede, and stated that he was considering all legal options, including a possible recount.

Jim Oberweis attended the congressional new member orientation on November 13. He began calling for a &quot;discovery recount&quot; on November 18.

According to the official canvass by the Illinois State Board of Elections, Lauren Underwood received 203,209 votes (50.67 percent) and Jim Oberweis received 197,835 votes (49.33 percent).

In January 2021, Oberweis filed a notice of contest with the U.S. House of Representatives, alleging that irregularities in the vote recount would make him the winner of the election. On May 12, 2021, the House rejected Oberweis&#x27; challenge.

==Electoral history==
































==Personal life==
Jim Oberweis and his first wife, Elaine, had five children together before divorcing in 2003. He has two stepchildren with his second wife, Julie, and twenty grandchildren.

<text>Joseph Zuken (December 12, 1912 – March 24, 1986) was a popular Communist politician in Winnipeg and the longest serving elected Communist party politician in North America. He served on the Winnipeg city council from 1961 to 1983.

Joe Zuken&#x27;s family immigrated to Canada from Ukraine when he was still an infant. Raised in a secular Jewish environment in Winnipeg&#x27;s working class North End he was educated at a secular Yiddish school in a socialist environment. He joined the Communist Party of Canada as a young lawyer and intervened in struggles for workers rights and in anti-fascist movements during the Great Depression.

Prior to the Second World War Zuken was connected with theatre in the city, both on-stage as an actor and off-stage, including an attempt to put on &quot;Eight Men Speak&quot; in a Winnipeg theatre.

As a lawyer he defended the party and left wing trade unions in court against state repression and later established a legal clinic to give poor people access to legal representation.

In 1941 Zuken was elected to Winnipeg&#x27;s school board and was one of the few Communists to win re-election through the Cold War. He fought for the establishment of kindergartens, free textbooks, and higher salaries for teachers.

After serving on the school board for twenty years he was elected, in 1961, to Winnipeg&#x27;s city council on behalf of the North End ward which had been represented since the 1930s by fellow Communist Jacob Penner. As an alderman he fought for public housing, public hospitals and rights for the poor.
Although Zuken&#x27;s membership in the Communist Party was controversial, he was respected by politicians across the political spectrum for both his intelligence and his political commitment. In early 1969, he won the unanimous support of his colleagues on city council for changes to Winnipeg&#x27;s Tenant Act. The reforms included the establishment of a landlord/tenant review board, restrictions on eviction notices, and improvements to the privacy rights of tenants.

In 1979 Zuken unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Winnipeg and won 18% of the vote.

He remained an alderman until his retirement in 1983 due to poor health.

Though a loyal member of the Communist Party he expressed public criticisms of the Soviet Union in the 1970s for its restrictions on Jewish emigration and official antisemitism in Poland in the late 1960s.

Zuken&#x27;s older brother, William Ross (Cecil Zuken), was also an active Communist politician, and served as leader of the Communist Party in Manitoba from 1948 to 1981.

<text>Arthur Davis ( Davidavitch) (June 14, 1905 – May 9, 2000) was an American animator and director known for his time at Warner Brothers&#x27; Termite Terrace cartoon studio.

== Early life ==
Davis was born on June 14, 1905, in Yonkers, New York to Hungarian parents. He is the younger brother of animators Mannie and Phil Davis. Mannie would eventually become a key director for Terrytoons while Phil worked alongside Arthur at the Screen Gems studio before he left in 1933.

== Career ==
Davis got his start as a teenager at Raoul Barre&#x27;s Studio in 1918 and later moved to Jefferson Film Corporation when the Mutt and Jeff cartoons began being made there in January 1921. It was claimed that he won a cartoon competition. In 1923 he joined Out Of The Inkwell Films in New York, working as an assistant in 1922 since Dick Huemer proposed him to be an assistant. He is reputed to have been the first in-betweener in the animation industry. Another of his distinctions was that he tapped out the famous &quot;bouncing ball&quot; of the &quot;Follow the Bouncing Ball&quot; cartoons of the 1920s. While one of the Fleischer brothers played the ukulele, Davis would keep time with a wooden stick with a white cut-out circle on the end, which was photographed and incorporated into the films as the actual moving ball. Later he was an assistant animator (soon promoted to an actual animator) for the Charles Mintz studio beginning in 1930. While there, he helped create and develop Toby the Pup and Scrappy with fellow animators Dick Huemer and Sid Marcus. Davis would eventually be promoted to director and remained at the studio even when Mintz died in 1939.

In 1941, Davis was fired from Screen Gems by Frank Tashlin and moved to Leon Schlesinger Productions (which would be renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons once Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros.). Davis worked as an animator for Tashlin&#x27;s department until late 1944 when it was assumed by Robert McKimson. Later in 1945, when Bob Clampett left and went to Screen Gems, Davis took over Clampett&#x27;s unit. Davis completed two cartoons left unfinished by Clampett, &quot;The Goofy Gophers&quot; and &quot;Bacall to Arms&quot;; cartoons still in the outline or storyboarding stages at the time of Clampett&#x27;s departure were allocated to other directors, with Robert McKimson ultimately directing &quot;Birth of a Notion&quot; and Friz Freleng directing &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot;.

Davis directed a number of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts, with a tone somewhere between those of Clampett and McKimson. He had a distinctive characteristic visual style, which can be seen as far back as Davis&#x27; Columbia shorts, in which the characters move from the foreground to the background, as well as from side to side, using all axes of the animation field. His department was shut down only two years later in November 1947 when Warners was having a budget problem. Davis was then taken into Friz Freleng&#x27;s unit, and served as one of Freleng&#x27;s key animators for many years. In 1960, shortly prior to departing the studio, Davis directed a cartoon for Warners again using Freleng&#x27;s unit (there were several shorts released around this time, from not only Freleng&#x27;s unit but Chuck Jones&#x27; as well, where the direction was credited to varying subordinates). &quot;Quackodile Tears&quot;, which would not see release until 1962 due to the studio&#x27;s elongated release backlog, was also Davis&#x27;s last Warner Brothers short.

Following his departure from Warners, Davis joined Hanna-Barbera, where he worked briefly as an animator and was a story director for &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;. He continued to work on and off with the studio as a consultant or a timing director until his retirement.

After leaving the studio in 1962, Davis went to Walter Lantz Productions as an animator. He left Lantz in 1965 he then later joining DePatie-Freleng Enterprises to direct &quot;Pink Panther&quot; shorts and other cartoon series.

Outliving most of his peers, Davis died peacefully on May 9, 2000, aged 94 in Sunnyvale, California after humming a tune. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.

<doc id="810810" wikidata="Q2045645" url="?curid=810810" title="Pokémon Emerald">
<text>is a 2004 role-playing video game developed by Game Freak and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It was first released in Japan in 2004, and was later released internationally in 2005. It is the fifth version, after both &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; and &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;, and is the final game of the third generation of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series.

The gameplay and controls are largely the same as the previous games in the series; players control a Pokémon trainer from an overhead perspective. As with &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, the player&#x27;s general goal is to explore the Hoenn region and conquer a series of eight Pokémon Gyms in order to challenge the Elite Four and the Hoenn Pokémon League Champion, while the main subplot is to defeat two criminal organizations attempting to harness a legendary Pokémon&#x27;s power for their own goals. Along with Pokémon that debuted in &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, the game incorporates Pokémon from &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; not featured in &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;.

&quot;Emerald&quot;″s reception was generally positive upon release. Praise was given to the addition of the Battle Frontier and for fixing story elements from &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The gameplay in &quot;Emerald&quot; is largely the same as in &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. Much of the game takes place in an overhead style; players&#x27; characters can move in four directions and can talk to other people on the overworld. Players can encounter wild Pokémon by walking into grass, surfing on their Pokémon, walking through caves, and other means. They can also battle other trainers&#x27; Pokémon. When this happens, the game shifts to a battle screen where players and their Pokémon are seen on the front-left portion of the screen while opponents are viewed on the back-right portion. Stats of the Pokémon and their trainers are shown on the side of each participant; these stats include the Pokémon&#x27;s levels, each trainers&#x27; number of Pokémon (from one to six), the Pokémon&#x27;s health, and any status effects, such as poison, paralysis or burn. Trainers send out the first Pokémon in their party and they take turns attacking where the first strike is determined usually by the speed of the two Pokémon. Players can choose from one of four options: Fight, Bag, Switch, and Run. Each Pokémon has up to four moves that they can use, which have different effects, number of uses, and types, such as Grass or Psychic. When a Pokémon hits 0 hit points (HP), they faint, forcing the Pokémon&#x27;s trainer to switch out. Once one trainer runs out of Pokémon, the battle is over. When a human-controlled Pokémon wins a battle, the Pokémon gains experience. Enough experience will earn that Pokémon a higher level, which grants upgraded stats—attack, defense, special attack, special defense, HP, and speed—and sometimes grant new moves and prompt the Pokémon to evolve.

Certain battles allow for two-on-two battles; certain moves were designed to support partners while other moves are capable of attacking two or more Pokémon. Unlike &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; which had the player fight two specific trainers, &quot;Emerald&quot; allowed for the player to have a 2-on-2 battle with two trainers both of whom they could usually battle separately. Every Pokémon has an ability that often aides in battle, such as abilities that make a Pokémon more powerful if they are close to fainting. Wild Pokémon encountered by players can be captured using items called Poké Balls, which have a greater chance of success the weaker the wild Pokémon is. Players can battle and trade with others using any of the third generation &quot;Pokémon&quot; games including &quot;Emerald&quot;, &quot;Ruby&quot;, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;FireRed&quot;, and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; by linking their Game Boy Advance systems together. This can be accomplished either by using a Game Boy Advance Link Cable or by use of the wireless adapter that was bundled with &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;. It is also compatible with &quot;Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness&quot;. This allows players to trade for Pokémon not normally obtainable in &quot;Emerald&quot;.

Aside from the traditional battle and overworld style, players&#x27; Pokémon are also able to participate in Pokémon Contests where they can try and win in five contest categories: &quot;Cool&quot;, &quot;Beauty&quot;, &quot;Cute&quot;, &quot;Smart&quot;, and &quot;Tough&quot; competitions. The players&#x27; characters are given a device early on called the PokéNav, which allows players to view the world map, check their Pokémon&#x27;s contest stats, and make and receive phone calls with trainers that they have met with whom they can chat or plan a battle. This replaces a function called &quot;Trainer&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, which allows players to register certain trainers and see when they are in the mood to battle. This also allows players to re-battle Gym Leaders, an ability not found in previous &quot;Pokémon&quot; games. &quot;Emerald&quot; includes several other new features and changes such as animations of Pokémon in-battle and an area called the Battle Frontier which is an expansion of the Battle Tower found in previous games. A man whom players encounter several times throughout the game will eventually allow them to access the Battle Frontier after beating the Pokémon League Champion. The Battle Frontier features the aforementioned Battle Tower in addition to six new areas. Completing these areas awards players with &quot;Battle Points&quot; which can be spent on prizes to use in and out of battle. The Japanese version features compatibility with the Nintendo e-Reader; however, this was cut for the English release due to its lack of success. Also featured is the Trainer Hill area which, in the Japanese version, is compatible with the e-Reader. Rare Pokémon that originated from earlier &quot;Pokémon&quot; games such as Mew, Lugia, and Ho-Oh were made available through an in-game event.

==Setting and story==

The setting and story remain largely the same as &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. Players can choose between either a boy or girl, both of whom have been given new outfits with a green color scheme, and one of three Pokémon before they proceed from their hometown into the rest of the game&#x27;s world.

Players are tasked with filling their Pokédex by catching different Pokémon species and evolving them. They are also tasked to complete eight gym challenges and defeat the Elite Four and the Pokémon League Champion by battling their Pokémon. Along the way, they make two rivals: May or Brendan, the child of the Pokémon Professor Birch, and Wally, a timid child from Petalburg who the player assists in catching his first Pokémon, a Ralts. They also encounter Wallace, the Hoenn League Champion.

Along their journey, they face both Team Magma and Team Aqua, who originally could only be faced in &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, respectively. Both have a goal to change the world they believe will benefit Pokémon—Magma desiring to expand the landmass and Aqua desiring to expand the sea—and both plan to accomplish their respective goals by summoning the legendary Pokémon Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. Both teams make repeated efforts to alter the landscape. Team Magma attempts to make a volcano erupt and Team Aqua tries to steal a weather-altering Pokémon.

Between the player&#x27;s visit to the seventh and eighth gyms, both teams summon their respectively-sought legendary Pokémon with mystical orbs stolen from Mt. Pyre; however, the Pokémon refuse to obey either team and begin fighting, which puts the world in a constantly switching state of droughts and heavy rainfalls. The player climbs a tower in order to summon the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza, who quells the other two Pokémon&#x27;s rage.

After the player defeats the Elite Four and Wallace to becoming the new Hoenn League Champion, they are able to encounter two Pokémon flying across Hoenn, Latias and Latios, and can access an area called the Battle Frontier, which adds several new challenges for the player. The player gains access to a battle with former Hoenn League Champion Steven Stone in Meteor Falls, who uses a powered-up version of his team in Ruby and Sapphire. The player is now able to catch Kyogre and Groudon, which can be tracked by talking to the scientist in the Weather Institute.

==Development and promotion==
&quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot; was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It was first announced in &quot;Coro Coro Magazine&quot;. It features compatibility with the Nintendo e-Reader and 83 cards launched for &quot;Emerald&quot; on October 7, 2004. It is the third version of &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; and follows a tradition of third releases, e.g. &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; for &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. The wireless adapter was bundled with Japanese copies of &quot;Emerald&quot;; this was removed from English versions of the game.

Nintendo has done several promotions related to &quot;Emerald&quot;. Nintendo held a competition for players based on &quot;Emerald&quot; where players compete to be the &quot;&quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot; Ultimate Frontier Battle Brain&quot;. The competition took place in seven areas across the United States and Canada, where 14 finalists, two from each area, competed in Seattle, Washington&#x27;s Space Needle for a trip for two to the Pokémon Park in Nagoya, Japan. People could also enter to win a trip to the Space Needle to watch the competition. The competition centered around trivia about characters from Pokémon and their abilities. Nintendo also introduced a pre-order program that would give those who pre-ordered the game exclusive access to a &quot;Pokémon&quot; website, a collector&#x27;s tin holder, and a guide to the Battle Frontier. A limited edition Game Boy Advance SP was released by Nintendo which featured a silhouette of the Pokémon Rayquaza. It was distributed by Nintendo in Japan exclusively on their website &quot;Pokémon Trainer Online&quot; and was never released outside of Japan. It was featured in the &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s list of rare &quot;Pokémon&quot; consoles. Players who brought their Game Boy Advance with a copy of &quot;Emerald&quot; and a wireless adapter to Booth 2029 of the 2005 Comic-Con International were given an in-game item called the Mystic Ticket which allows players the opportunity to capture Lugia and Ho-oh.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot; received generally positive reception and holds aggregate scores of 76/100 and 76.65% on Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. It received an award for excellence at the ninth annual CESA game awards. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Craig Harris stated that while he was not enthused by &quot;Emerald&quot;, he admitted that it was a solid game and that it was the best version to get for people who hadn&#x27;t played &quot;Ruby&quot; or &quot;Sapphire&quot; yet. &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s Christian Nutt felt that it was the definitive version of &quot;Pokémon&quot; at the time yet was also a rehash. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Phil Theobald felt that it was a good game in its own right but felt like the same game as &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Ryan Davis noted that it was a quality experience despite being similar to &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; and that hardcore fans may appreciate its changes. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Corey Brotherson felt that it was a good game in its own right but was lacking in compelling additions. He added however that it was a better game for players new to the series. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Laurie Blake performed a retroactive review of &quot;Emerald&quot;; she felt that the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games have aged well but still feel like they did in 1996. She further stated that the similarities between it and &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; prevented it from being a must-have while still being good. &quot;Allgame&quot;″s Julia Reges felt that the game had a lot of value for younger players but that older players may be uninterested. She compared Nintendo&#x27;s remakes of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games to the various &quot;Star Wars&quot; remakes.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Audrey Drake praised the game for utilizing both of the villain groups and called it a &quot;marked departure&quot; from &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. She felt that the ability to re-battle Gym Leaders created an &quot;exciting challenge&quot; for players. She also included &quot;Emerald&quot;, alongside &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, in a list of Game Boy Advance games that she wanted to see on the Nintendo 3DS&#x27; eShop. &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s &quot;IGN&quot;″s Lucas M. Thomas bemoaned the fact that he had to play through the whole game before he could play the Battle Frontier. Jeremy Parish listed &quot;Emerald&quot; as one of the best games to bring onto a plane. Fellow &quot;1UP.com&quot; editor Kat Bailey included it in her list of remakes that &quot;left the originals in the dust&quot;. She praised the Battle Frontier and its fixes for flaws found in &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;.

===Sales===
&quot;Emerald&quot; launched in the top spot in Japan with 791,000 copies sold in its first week and 372,000 copies sold in its first day. It was the fourth best-selling game in Japan for 2004. It sold 1.4 million for the year and ranked behind &quot;Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride&quot;, &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; (combined), and &quot;Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King&quot;.

<text>Peter Claver Cullen (born July 28, 1941) is a Canadian voice actor. He voiced Optimus Prime in the original 1980s &quot;Transformers&quot; animated series, later returning to the role in &quot;Transformers&quot; media in 2007, starting with the first live-action film. He has also voiced many other characters across a wide variety of popular media, including Eeyore in the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; franchise, Monterey Jack in &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;, the first voice of KARR in &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and the vocalizations of the title character in &quot;Predator&quot;.

He was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 2023 as part of the 2nd Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Awards.

==Early life==
Cullen was born on July 28, 1941, in Montreal, Quebec, to American parents Henry and Muriel (née McCann) Cullen. He is of Irish descent. He has three siblings: Michaela, Sonny, and Larry. He is a member of the first graduating class of the National Theatre School of Canada, which he graduated in 1963. His brother, Larry Cullen, was a retired captain in the United States Marine Corps, and helped inspire the voice of Optimus Prime.

==Career==

===1960–1970===
In 1968, he and Joan Stuart appeared as &quot;Giles&quot; and &quot;Penelope&quot; in &quot;L&#x27;Anglaise&quot;, a recurring segment about a French-Canadian man with an English-Canadian wife, on the CBC Radio comedy series, &quot;Funny You Should Say That&quot;.

Cullen played a French-Canadian astronaut character named Commander Bi Bi Latuque alongside Ted Zeigler for the 1969 children&#x27;s show, &quot;The Buddies&quot; on CFCF-TV in Montreal. He honed his voice skills by working as a radio announcer, notably in his home town of Montreal on (then) MOR station CKGM doing the overnight and weekend swing shifts. From 1967 to 1969, he was the announcer for &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;.

From 1971 to 1974, he, Zeigler and Billy Van were series regulars on &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;. In 1974, Cullen was the announcer and a series regular (with Ted Zeigler and Billy Van) on &quot;The Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show&quot;. He lent his voice to a character in the album &quot;The Story of Halloween Horror&quot; in 1977.

===As Optimus Prime===
Cullen recalls auditioning for the role of the robot character Optimus Prime at a casting house in Burbank, California, explaining that as he read Prime&#x27;s character breakdown, he saw that it was &quot;the opportunity of the year&quot;, and heeded his brother Larry&#x27;s advice: &quot;Peter, don&#x27;t be a Hollywood hero, be a real hero. Real heroes don&#x27;t yell and act tough; they&#x27;re tough enough to be gentle, so control yourself.&quot; Cullen later learned from his agent, Steve Tisherman, that he not only won the part of Prime, but also, to his surprise, the role of Ironhide as well, which he saw as a &quot;home run&quot;.

He has stated that Optimus is his favorite voice role, and that he based the voice of the Autobot leader on his older brother Larry, who served in Vietnam. &quot;When he came home, I could see a change. He was quieter and he was a man and a superhero to me,&quot; says the actor. &quot;I watched him and listened to him. I&#x27;d never had an opportunity to do a superhero, and when that came, [that voice] just came right out of me and I sounded like Optimus.&quot;

He has also stated that he had no idea of Prime&#x27;s popularity until the character&#x27;s controversial death in the 1986 animated film, because the studio had never given him fan letters from children addressed to Optimus. The public backlash over Optimus&#x27;s death surprised producers greatly. Children were leaving the theaters distraught because of the character&#x27;s death. The writers temporarily revived the character for a single episode in Season 3 called &quot;Dark Awakening&quot;. Initially, this was intended to be his final appearance, but after fan requests continued, &quot;The Return of Optimus Prime&quot;, a two-part episode was produced. The original ending of &quot;Dark Awakening&quot; was altered in reruns to include a teaser about the return of the character, and indeed, Optimus returned once and for all to lead the Autobots for the final five episodes of the original American cartoon series.

Cullen reprised the role of Optimus Prime in the 2007 &quot;Transformers&quot; live-action film, the sequels &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the spin-off/prequels &quot;Bumblebee&quot; and &quot;&quot; and the video games based on the film series. Though he was only contractually obligated to voice Optimus up to &quot;The Last Knight&quot;, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated in 2021 that Cullen was welcome to voice the character for as long as he wanted.

Cullen again reprised his role as Optimus Prime in the video games &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and in the recent television series &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. His performance in the premiere season of &quot;&quot; earned him a nomination for a 2011 Daytime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program category.

===Other work===

In the 1980s and 1990s, Cullen appeared on a number of television shows. He has played Coran, Stride the Tiger Fighter, and King Alfor in the Lion &quot;Voltron&quot; series, the transforming spaceship/robot Ramrod, the heroic Commander Eagle and the villainous Nemesis in the 1980s anime series &quot;Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs&quot;, Commander James Hawkins in the Vehicle &quot;Voltron&quot; series, Eeyore in the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; franchise, the original voice of KARR in &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, Antor and Bomba, and Gunner, in &quot;Dino-Riders&quot;, Airborne, Zandar and Nemesis Enforcer in &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;. He played Mantor/Mantys in Coleco&#x27;s 5 episode mini-series &quot;Sectaurs&quot; in 1986; Red Skull in the 1981 cartoon series of &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, Klaar and Zanzoar in &quot;Megas XLR&quot; and Mantus in &quot;The Pirates of Dark Water&quot;. He also had a voice part in the 1984 motion picture &quot;Gremlins&quot; (as a gremlin) and in the first season of the 2008 &quot;Knight Rider&quot; series, where he reprised his vocal role as KARR (from the original &quot;Knight Rider&quot; series). He also did voicework in &quot;The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible&quot; series, notably as Japheth, one of Noah&#x27;s sons in the &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; episode, and the King of Nineveh in the &quot;Jonah&quot; episode. He was well known by some as the main villain Venger in the animated series of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. He played the evil sorcerer Renwick in the lesser known series &quot;Little Wizards&quot; and played Cindarr in the short-lived series &quot;&quot;.

Among many other television series and films, he has also lent his basso voice to many film trailers and television commercials, including announcing for the &quot;Toonami&quot; and &quot;You Are Here&quot; blocks on the Cartoon Network. Cullen spent some of his early professional years in Montreal as a radio announcer/DJ on CKGM; and as a character in a then-popular local television kids show. He acted the role of a French-Canadian astronaut, along with writer and his partner on the show, Ted Ziegler. Both Ziegler and Cullen were in the supporting cast of &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, as well as other network comedies of the era.

He voiced Nintendo&#x27;s mascot Mario in the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; segments on the 1983–1984 TV series &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot;, making him the first person to ever provide a voice for the character in western media.

Cullen has done voicework on drum and bass DJ Dieselboy&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;The Dungeonmaster&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and narration on the 2013 album &quot;Tetragrammaton&quot; by the Dutch extreme metal band The Monolith Deathcult. &quot;Tetragrammaton&quot; also featured Cullen on bass in &quot;God&#x27;s Among Insects.&quot; Additionally, he did voicework for the unreleased Blizzard Entertainment game &quot;Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans&quot;, and provided narration for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan film series I.M.P.S.: The Relentless.

Cullen is a voice announcer on &quot;Police Story 4: First Strike&quot; in advertisements for New Line Cinema, lending his experience as an ex-cop for the Santa Monica division to the cast.

He has also done voice work for promotions of the 1999 film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. In 2023 he joined season 2 of Amazon Originals &quot;Invincible&quot; series.

==Personal life==
Cullen has four children: Clay, Angus, Claire, and Pilar, and three grandchildren. He is a good friend of his longtime &quot;Transformers&quot; co-star and fellow voice actor Frank Welker, in contrast to the rivalry of their respective characters, Optimus Prime and Megatron.

Cullen is a devoted fan and supporter of NASA, citing the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969 as the start of his interest. As such, he sees the interaction between Optimus Prime and Buzz Aldrin in &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; as one of his proudest moments.

==Honours==
At BotCon 2010, Hasbro named Cullen as one of the first four human inductees in the Transformers Hall of Fame for his role as the voice of Optimus Prime.

<doc id="810840" wikidata="Q6245684" url="?curid=810840" title="John M. Ashbrook">
<text>John Milan Ashbrook (September 21, 1928 – April 24, 1982) was an American politician and newspaper publisher. A member of the Republican Party, he served in the United States House of Representatives from Ohio from 1961 until his death. Ashbrook was associated with the New Right. He ran against President Richard Nixon in the 1972 Republican Party presidential primaries, attempting to appeal to voters who believed Nixon was insufficiently conservative, but he failed to win any statewide contests. At the time of his death, he was running for U.S. Senate in Ohio in the 1982 election.

==Early life==
John Milan Ashbrook was born on September 21, 1928, in Johnstown, Ohio to William A. Ashbrook, a newspaper editor, businessman, and U.S. representative, and Marie Swank. Ashbrook graduated from Harvard University in 1952 and later from Ohio State University&#x27;s law school in 1955. In 1953, Ashbrook became the publisher of his father&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Johnstown Independent&quot;. On July 3, 1948, he married Joan Needles and later had three children with her before they divorced in 1971. In 1974, he remarried to Jean Spencer.

==Career==

He was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1956, and served two terms. In 1960, the seat that his father had once held in the House of Representatives was vacated and Ashbrook ran for and won it. Ashbrook voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, but in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

===1964 presidential election===

With William Rusher and F. Clifton White, associates from the Young Republicans in the 1950s, Ashbrook was involved in the start-up of the Draft Goldwater Committee in 1961.

In 1966, journalist Drew Pearson reported that Ashbrook was one of a group of four Congressmen who had received the &quot;Statesman of the Republic&quot; award from Liberty Lobby for their &quot;right-wing activities&quot;.

===1972 presidential election===

Despite having supported Richard Nixon during the 1968 presidential election Ashbrook turned against him during his presidency. On December 29, 1971 he announced that he would oppose Nixon in the Republican primaries as an alternative conservative candidate and received support from conservative figures like William F. Buckley Jr. His slogan &quot;No Left Turns&quot; was illustrated by a mock traffic symbol of a left-turn arrow with a superimposed No symbol. It was meant to symbolize the frustration of some conservatives with Nixon, whom they saw as having abandoned conservative principles and &quot;turned left&quot; on issues such as budget deficits, affirmative action, the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, wage and price controls, and most of all, improving relations with the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China with his policy of détente.

Ashbrook competed in the New Hampshire (9.8% of the vote), Florida (9%), and California (10%) primaries. He withdrew from the race after the California primary and &quot;with great reluctance&quot; supported Nixon. His campaign, although of minimal immediate impact, is remembered fondly by conservatives who admire Ashbrook for having stood for their principles. Ashbrook said in criticism of the Nixon administration, &quot;I still believe it in the best American tradition to speak out even when it is in criticism of your party&#x27;s actions.&quot;

When Nixon became mired in the Watergate scandal, Ashbrook became the first House Republican to call for the President&#x27;s resignation.

==Death ==
In 1982, Ashbrook ran for U.S. Senate, seeking to challenge Democratic incumbent Howard Metzenbaum. Polling showed that he was the frontrunner in the Republican primary. However, on April 24, 1982, he suffered a gastric hemorrhage at the offices of &quot;The Johnstown Independent&quot;, and died at Licking Memorial Hospital in Newark, Ohio, aged 53. President Ronald Reagan memorialized him, saying: &quot;John Ashbrook was a man of courage and principle. He served his constituents and his country with dedication and devotion, always working towards the betterment of his fellow man. His patriotism and deep belief in the greatness of America never wavered and his articulate and passionate calls for a return to old-fashioned American values earned him the respect of all who knew him.&quot;

Ashbrook&#x27;s widow, Jean Spencer Ashbrook, was chosen in a special election to serve the remaining seven months of his congressional term.

== Ashbrook Center ==
The Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs at Ashland University was named for Ashbrook in 1983. A periodic John M. Ashbrook Memorial Dinner at the center features leading conservative speakers from President Ronald Reagan (first dinner; dedication of the Center, in 1983) and Margaret Thatcher (1993) to Mitt Romney (April 2010) and John Boehner (June 2011).

<doc id="810847" wikidata="Q983302" url="?curid=810847" title="Gian Giacomo Medici">
<text>Gian Giacomo Medici or Jacopo de&#x27; Medici (25 January 1498 – 8 November 1555) was an Italian condottiero who became a noted Spanish general, Duke of Marignano and Marquess of Musso and Lecco in Lombardy.

Gian Giacomo Medici was the brother of Giovanni Angelo Medici, who was later to be elected Pope as Pius IV. They were scions of an impoverished, though patrician, family of Milan not connected with the Medici of Florence, in spite of the Medici heraldic &quot;palle&quot; appearing in the contemporary engraving (&quot;illustration&quot;): thus the nickname &quot;Il Medeghino&quot;, the &quot;little Medici&quot;.

Gian Giacomo, the eldest of fourteen children, was banished from Milan after a daring murder of revenge in broad daylight. He fled to Lake Como where he gathered about him a band of brigands answerable to none but him. He threw in his lot as bodyguard to the future Duke of Milan, Francesco II Sforza, who had been reinstated in Milan by Emperor Charles V. The &quot;Medeghino&quot; gained a reputation for unscrupulous violence in the Sforza pay; in partial recompense, he was made Marquis of Marignano on 28 March 1528 (by Imperial patent and confirmed by Francesco Sforza II, Duke of Milan), and also Marquis of Musso and Lecco.

That he fled to Lake Como was no coincidence. For, he was born in Valsolda which is a part of the community of Porlezza. Evidence can be found that Marquis Giacomo di Medici was born in Valsolda and even had a residence in the community of Porlezza. In the main church of Cima, which belongs to the community of Porlezza, an inconspicuous relief shows the lion of San Marco, a symbol of the alliance between Gian Giacomo de Medici and the former Republic of Venice. It was put there in honour of his achievements. A description of the relief can be found on a plaque alongside.

It is likely that Gian Giacomo even had a residence in Cima, on the same spot where now stands a hotel, probably not called by chance Parco San Marco.

Il Medeghino became a famous &quot;condottiere&quot;, or soldier of fortune, who fought in the pay of Charles V at the Battle of Mühlberg and elsewhere in Italy (the &quot;War of Siena&quot;), in the Wars of Religion in France and in the Low Countries. The great engineer Agostino Ramelli trained with Gian Giacomo, who instructed him in mathematics and architecture.

In 1543 he purchased the ancient fortified castle of Frascarolo, near present-day Induno Olona, in the Valceresio, which he converted into a sumptuous villa. In the summer of 1545 he married Marzia Orsini, daughter of Ludovico Orsini, conte di Pitigliano. He was made a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1555, also the year of his death. Il Medeghino is buried in the Duomo of Milan.

Since his only son, Camillo (died after 1586), was illegitimate, albeit made a Knight of the Order of Malta, Gian Giacomo&#x27;s honours passed to his brother Agosto (1501–1570).

<text>State Farm Insurance is a group of mutual insurance companies throughout the United States with corporate headquarters in Bloomington, Illinois. Founded in 1922, it is the largest property, casualty and auto insurance provider in the United States.

== Overview ==

State Farm is the largest property and casualty insurance provider, and the largest auto insurance provider, in the United States.
State Farm is ranked 39th in the 2024 Fortune 500, which lists American companies by revenue.

State Farm relies on exclusive agents (also known as captive agents) to sell insurance. Only State Farm agents can sell State Farm insurance, and their agents can sell only State Farm products.

=== Financial services ===
State Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.

The bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or, over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.

In the 1950s, State Farm held a contest among the agents to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H. Kent, a State Farm agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H. Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H. Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years.

== History ==
State Farm was founded in June 1922 by retired farmer George J. Mecherle as a mutual automobile insurance company owned by its policyholders. The firm specialized in auto insurance for farmers and offered better rates than rival companies, which must also cover expensive premiums of the urban motorists. It later expanded services into other types of insurance, such as homeowners and life insurance, and then to banking and financial services.

 State Farm had 70,000 employees and 19,000 agents. February 2014 figures show the group servicing 80 million policies in the United States and Canada, of which over 44,000,000 are for automobiles, 27,000,000 are for fire, 7,000,000 for life, and more than 2 million bank accounts.

Michael L. Tipsord is chairman and CEO of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. The company announced on December 28, 2023, that Tipsord will be retiring in 2024 and will be succeeded by Jon Farney, currently the company&#x27;s chief financial officer. Jon Farney is the current president and chief executive officer of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.

By 2017, State Farms announced its plan to exit 11 facilities in the United States to streamline and improve processes. In 2014, it sold its operations in Canada to Desjardins Group, which continued to use the State Farm name. Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continued to be used for agents and marketing until 2018. In 2018, State Farm Canada was officially rebranded to Desjardins Insurance through Desjardins Insurance Agents. The whole transition was completed in 2019.

On May 28, 2023, the company announced it would stop issuing new home insurance policies in California due to wildfire risks and surging construction costs.

In February 2025, State Farm, the largest home insurer in California, requested state regulators to approve an emergency rate increase due to the financial strain caused by payouts related to the January 2025 Southern California wildfires. The company is seeking an average rate hike of 22%, effective May 1, 2025. Specifically, the proposed increases include a 15% rise for renters and condominium owners and a 38% increase for insurance on rental dwellings. This follows previous rate adjustments, with a 6.9% increase granted in 2023 and a 20% increase the year before. Additionally, there is a pending request for a 30% hike, though it&#x27;s unclear if this is still being pursued alongside the 22% increase.

=== Logo ===

The State Farm interlocked red tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design depicting three interlocking ovals representing the company&#x27;s core auto, life, and fire insurance business was critical to its brand image.

On December 15, 2011, State Farm transformed its interlocked tri-oval logo into a contemporary one to showcase the company&#x27;s core service offerings of auto, fire, and life insurance. The new logo was introduced on January 1, 2012, in celebration of the company&#x27;s 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design with no wording in the ovals adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, marketing vice president at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in today&#x27;s digital world.

==Marketing and promotions==

===Jingle===

The State Farm jingle (&quot;Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there&quot;) was written by American singer-songwriter Barry Manilow in 1971. A cover was released by Weezer in 2011. State Farm&#x27;s first commercial jingle was created for &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; in the 1960s.

===Television ads===

In June 2011, State Farm premiered its &quot;Get to a Better State&quot; campaign. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle &quot;Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there&quot;. A State Farm agent will then appear, as if by magic, and help the group out with their problem. A few commercials deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.
Also in 2011, State Farm premiered its &quot;State of...&quot; advertising campaign. One notable commercial, &quot;State of Unrest&quot;, shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. The man&#x27;s wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: &quot;It&#x27;s Jake from State Farm&quot; (the original Jake from State Farm was portrayed by Jake Stone, who was an actual employee of the company). The man&#x27;s wife then takes the phone and asks, &quot;What are you wearing, &#x27;Jake from State Farm?&#x27;&quot;, to which the male agent responds in a timid way, &quot;Uh, khakis&quot;. The undaunted wife says, &quot;She sounds hideous&quot;, and the husband replies, &quot;Well she&#x27;s a guy, so...&quot; In May 2015, a variation of &quot;State of Unrest&quot; premiered, starring The Coneheads from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This ad series later added Laraine Newman as Connie.

In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will &quot;never&quot; do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is &quot;never letting go.&quot; The commercial is based on the saying &quot;never say never&quot; and how people say that they will &quot;never&quot; do something, only to do it anyway.

In 2015, State Farm released &quot;The Hoopers&quot;, a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.
In 2020, Kevin Miles took over the role of Jake from State Farm from Jake Stone in a series of commercials, the first ad airing before Super Bowl LIV, as a reimagining of the original 2011 &quot;State of Unrest&quot; commercial from the &quot;State of...&quot; campaign. Craig Miller of State Farm&#x27;s agency The Marketing Arm said the character was so popular people were still dressing as him for Halloween. Jake from State Farm, who wears a red shirt and khakis, appeared in different settings, including a beekeeper outfit and a parody of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, and in a number commercials with celebrities, including Alfonso Ribeiro, Chris Paul, Aaron Rodgers and Paul Rudd. On his first anniversary as Jake, Miles appeared in a commercial during Super Bowl LV in which Drake appeared as his stand-in. According to Marketing Arm, Jake is better known than Katie Couric or Hilary Swank and 80 percent of those who know him like him. A report by Semrush says that State Farm was the top digital advertiser in Finance in 2023.

USA Today&#x27;s Ad Meter selected State Farm&#x27;s entry &quot;Like a Good Neighbaaa&quot; as the top ad in Super Bowl LVIII. The spot features Arnold Schwarzenegger struggling with the word &quot;neighbor&quot; in the company&#x27;s tagline until he gets assistance from his &quot;Twins&quot; co-star Danny DeVito as well as Jake from State Farm.

==Criticism, controversies and viewpoints==

=== Allegations of corporate influence and racketeering ===

==== $250 million settlement ====
The State Farm settlement, a racketeering class action concluded with a $250 million agreement, involved allegations of potential corporate influence on the Illinois Supreme Court. According to the lawsuit&#x27;s amended complaint, State Farm was accused of leveraging its influence and financial contributions to nonprofits such as the U.S. Chamber and the Illinois Civil Justice League. The claim stated that this alleged influence played a role in the appointment of a specific justice to the Illinois Supreme Court in 2004. Subsequently, the justice joined four other state justices in overturning a billion-dollar judgment against State Farm. State Farm has consistently denied any wrongdoing and maintains that the claims are without merit.

=== Hurricane Katrina aftermath ===

==== &quot;Rigsby v. State Farm&quot; and 100 million settlement ====
In 2006, two former State Farm claims adjusters, sisters Cori and Kerri Rigsby, acted as whistleblowers and filed a &quot;qui tam&quot; suit against State Farm under the False Claims Act. The Rigsby sisters claimed that State Farm shifted state claims to federal flood insurance that should have been covered by private wind insurance, making the federal government and not State Farm liable for the insurance. In 2013, the Rigsbys won the fraud case focused on one Mississippi home; in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the verdict. As part of the $100 million settlement, State Farm dismissed its counterclaims against the whistleblowers, alleging breaches of employment agreements and other laws. The federal government will pay the $100 million in restitution, not individual policyholders.

==== Wrongful denial of claims ====
A 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, were increasingly fighting claims of those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations. This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.
Plaintiff&#x27;s attorney Richard F &quot;Dickie&quot; Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March 2008 for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a US$50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a US$26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.

=== Florida potential withdrawal ===
In early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state&#x27;s largest insurer, offered to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out US$1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers had also pulled out of Florida; many homeowners used the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government. State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.

In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.

=== Other lawsuits ===

==== &quot;Campbell v. State Farm&quot; ====

In 1981, Curtis Campbell caused an accident in which a man was killed and another was left permanently disabled. Both witnesses at the scene confirmed Campbell was at fault. State Farm contested liability and declined settlement offers from the victim&#x27;s estates. State Farm assured Campbell that &quot;their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.&quot; Despite State Farm contesting liability, the jury rendered a verdict that Campbell was 100 percent liable for the accident. State Farm refused to pay the excess amount or post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the verdict. Campbell obtained his own counsel to do this.

In 1984, while the appeal was ongoing, Campbell reached a settlement with the victim&#x27;s estate, where Campbell would pursue an insurance bad faith action against State Farm. The attorneys for the victim&#x27;s estate would represent Campbell in the bad-faith suit.

In 1989, Campbell&#x27;s appeal was denied by the Utah Supreme Court. State Farm then paid the entire amount of the judgment, including the excess amount they previously denied to pay. Campbell proceeded to file suit against State Farm for bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Utah Supreme Court reinstated a $145 million punitive verdict against State Farm, making note that an earlier $100 million judgment was unreported to State Farm&#x27;s corporate headquarters. The regional vice president had no plans to report said judgment under review.

==== &quot;Radcliff v. State Farm&quot; ====
Following the Good Friday 2006 hailstorm in Indiana that resulted in over $1 billion in property damages, State Farm faced approximately 50,000 claims for damage, out of which it rejected more than 7,000 claims. Joseph Radcliff, a roofer who established a company to repair homes damaged by the storm, was hired by around 300 State Farm policyholders. During his work, Radcliff observed that some of his clients, whose claims had been denied by State Farm, resided next to homeowners whose claims had been approved by other insurance companies. Radcliff reported State Farm to the Indiana Department of Insurance.

In response, State Farm took legal action against Radcliff, labeling him as the defendant in a case where they accused him of fourteen felony counts, including corrupt business influence and attempted theft. State Farm based these charges on fabricated evidence claiming that Radcliff had vandalized roofs in order to file fraudulent insurance claims. However, all charges against Radcliff were eventually dismissed. Radcliff&#x27;s business lost 385 out of 400 jobs as a result of the charges, despite them being dismissed.

In the subsequent legal proceedings, Radcliff countersued State Farm, alleging defamation, abuse of process, and interference with business relationships. The case advanced to a jury trial, where Radcliff was awarded $14.5 million. State Farm appealed the decision. Radcliff won on two appeal processes and was awarded $17 million in damages and interest.

==== &quot;Doherty v. State Farm&quot; ====
In a lawsuit filed by actor Shannen Doherty against State Farm, a federal jury in Los Angeles awarded her $6.3 million in damages. The lawsuit claimed that State Farm had failed to adequately compensate Doherty for the damage to her Malibu home caused by a California wildfire in 2018. The jury found that State Farm&#x27;s denial of policy benefits for Doherty&#x27;s property was unreasonable and lacked proper cause. State Farm expressed empathy for Doherty&#x27;s health but disagreed with the jury&#x27;s decision, indicating that they would explore legal options, including a possible appeal.

==== &quot;Cook v. State Farm&quot; ====
In 2015, Charles and Bernadette Cook were involved in a car crash where their vehicle struck an uninsured vehicle stopped sideways in their traffic lane. The Cooks had coverage through State Farm against uninsured motorists and filed a claim accordingly. According to their policy, State Farm was obligated to pay up to $250,000 per person or $500,000 per occurrence, with a personal liability limit of $1 million. State Farm refused to pay the awarded amounts of $100,000 for Charles Cook and $400,000 for Bernadette Cook when they pursued their claim. The insurer cited Illinois statute 215 ILCS 5/143a, which it claimed allowed them to reject awards exceeding $75,000, despite the awards falling within the policy limits. State Farm&#x27;s refusal to pay led to a lawsuit filed by the Cooks against the company, alleging negligence in various aspects of the claims process. Additionally, it was claimed that during arbitration, State Farm&#x27;s lawyer introduced personal information that had been excluded as evidence, which was considered &quot;willful and wanton conduct.&quot; State Farm agreed to a settlement of $650,000 and dropped its own suit against Bernadette Cook. The settlement amount is believed to be the largest reported for a bad faith claim against State Farm in Illinois.

==== &quot;Julian v. State Farm&quot; ====
State Farm was hit with a class-action lawsuit in California for allegedly breaching its contracts with drivers. The lead plaintiff, Joan St. Julian, claims that State Farm violated the law by failing to pay sales tax to drivers when reimbursing them for the &quot;actual cash value&quot; of their cars that were deemed total losses. According to the lawsuit, State Farm systematically underpaid claims made by thousands of consumers who experienced total vehicle loss. The lawsuit alleges that State Farm processed around 115,000 total loss claims during the relevant period, with approximately 10 percent of those claims not being paid the sales tax owed.

=== Wildfires and subsequent damages ===

==== State Farm pulls out of California due to wildfire risk ====
As of May 27, 2023, State Farm has ceased accepting new applicants for business and personal casualty insurance in California. State Farm states that this decision was made due to &quot;historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market.&quot; California has had over 15,000 wildfires from 2021 to 2023, partially due to a dry, windy and hot climate. More than 2.7 million people live in &quot;very high fire hazard severity zones&quot;.

==== East Troublesome fire ====
Several survivors of the East Troublesome Fire in October 2020 have filed lawsuits against State Farm, alleging that the company underestimated the costs of rebuilding and delayed claim payments. One attorney representing two families, stated that numerous families were experiencing delays of up to a year in receiving payment from State Farm. Another plaintiff alleged that State Farm undervalued his home by less than half the actual rebuilding cost and delayed payment for the coverage of personal property. The lawsuits cite Colorado&#x27;s statute that penalizes insurance companies for unreasonable payment delays.

==== Tubbs fire ====
The Tubbs Fire occurred in October 2017. It was one of California&#x27;s most destructive fires, burning and allegedly killing 22 people. Six months after the fire, a large number of people claimed that State Farm had refused to pay them in full despite losing everything they owned. To get their full payout, they had to create a detailed, item-by-item list of everything that was lost, or their payout was reduced by 25%. Policyholders stated that they received letters from State Farm suggesting that the California Code requires a listed inventory &quot;for some time.&quot; The California Department of Insurance denied this requirement.

==== &quot;McGee v. State Farm&quot; ====
In 2008, John McGee sued State Farm for wrongful denial of medical claims, denying him revenue he was entitled to for rendered treatments. He alleged that false examinations were done by State Farm to cut off benefits, resulting in denied claims. McGee alleged that State Farm and &quot;IME&quot; companies conspired to produce fraudulent reports in order to terminate benefits. McGee&#x27;s claims were dismissed.

=== Plaintiff lawsuits ===

==== Jewish discrimination ====
In 1993, Todd Hindin filed a lawsuit against State Farm for allegedly keeping a list of prominent lawyers referred to within State Farm as the &quot;Jewish Lawyers List&quot;. Any claims made by clients of these attorneys were automatically forwarded to State Farm&#x27;s fraud unit, potentially on the basis of the religion and national origin of the lawyers. These claims would then be neither settled nor paid. State Farm initially claimed that this was not a matter of discrimination, but of coincidence. Frank Taylor, an experienced economist on retainer for the Appellants, argued that though the states involved contained 2-5% Jewish populations, the list contained 14% religiously or ethnically Jewish lawyers. People who had worked for State Farm, including former Divisional Claim Superintendent Ron Middler, testified that the list was potentially used to screen the lawyers mentioned in the list. State Farm paid out $30 million to Todd Hindin and his clients for discrimination on the basis of religion and national origin.

Documents that Hindin uncovered would assist in another case in 2003, &quot;Campbell v. State Farm&quot;, in which State Farm had to pay out $145 million in punitive damages (later reduced by the U.S. Supreme Court) after acting in bad faith. State Farm had to pay damages to the families of two car crash victims for whom Campbell was responsible, despite originally informing him and his family &quot;that their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel&quot;.

==== New York City garage lawsuit ====
On April 18, 2023, a Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District parking garage collapsed. The collapse killed one worker and injured five others, as well as crushing the cars in the garage. A total of 43 of the damaged cars were insured by State Farm policyholders, to which State Farm paid out $1.5 million in payments to the garage&#x27;s customers whose vehicles were damaged in the collapse. State Farm alleged that the owners &quot;failed to properly operate, manage, maintain and/or control the garage&quot;, thus resulting in the collapse.

==== 5.4 million RICO suit against doctors ====
In a civil RICO suit filed in 2005, State Farm was awarded over $15.4 million by a federal jury in a case involving alleged medical fraud. Arnold Lincow, an osteopathic doctor, along with eight other defendants, were accused of inflating patients&#x27; medical bills to defraud insurers systematically. State Farm claimed in court documents that Lincow devised a scheme to inflate the medical bills of car accident victims by prescribing unnecessary tests, treatments, prescriptions, and medical equipment. The scheme allegedly involved fabricating treatment records, falsifying injury descriptions, and submitting bills for services not rendered. Lincow was accused of directing other doctors and employees to perform medically inappropriate and unnecessary services. According to the lawsuit, Lincow also hired Sacks to misinterpret diagnostic tests as positive to exhaust available medical coverage. Additionally, Lincow was accused of orchestrating a kickback scheme with Hirsh&#x27;s pharmacy, filling unnecessary prescriptions in exchange for inflated rent payments. All nine defendants were found to participate in a RICO conspiracy, committing both common law and statutory insurance fraud.

On July 19, 2023, plaintiffs Mary Brown, Andy Velazquez, William Midgett, and Diane Coughlin took legal action by initiating a class action lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court against State Farm. This legal action is rooted in allegations of State Farm&#x27;s violation of Illinois privacy rights laws. The plaintiffs are individuals who were involved in accidents with drivers insured by State Farm.

The core of their claim revolves around the alleged sharing of their personal health information with Insurance Services Office Inc. (ISO), a company specializing in comprehensive risk management analysis, supported by an extensive database. Both federal HIPAA law and the Illinois state constitution expressly forbid the disclosure of health information without an individual&#x27;s explicit consent.

The plaintiffs maintain that ISO benefited financially by accumulating personal information for utilization within the insurance industry, including by State Farm.

=== Gender discrimination ===
In a sex discrimination lawsuit against State Farm in 1985, Judge Thelton Henderson approved a settlement that required the company to pay up to $420,000 each to women who were denied jobs as insurance agents in California due to gender discrimination. The settlement, limited to California residents due to the class action nature of the lawsuit, also stipulates that women must receive 50 percent of the available sales agent positions at State Farm in California over the next 10 years.

=== Disability discrimination ===
In July 2023, Elisa Brown, who was employed by State Farm for 20 years, sued State Farm alleging &quot;discrimination and retaliation&quot; because of her bladder disability. Brown was diagnosed with overactive bladder syndrome in February 2020, suffering from urinary incontinence.

Brown claims that State Farm met her initial need for accommodations. After a few months, however, her supervisor prohibited her from taking unscheduled breaks, and her breaks were monitored. After reaching out to State Farm&#x27;s human resources with no resolution, she reached out to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. After notifying HR about her contacting the EEOC, Brown was terminated from her State Farm position.

=== Racial discrimination ===
There have been several allegations and lawsuits of racial discrimination against State Farm. One lawsuit, filed in 2020, describes a pattern of discrimination against seven agents of color by the company, citing a study done by The Center on Race, Inequality and the Law at the NYU School of Law. According to the survey, it was found that Black homeowners were required to complete more paperwork and engage in more interactions with claims adjusters before State Farm would approve their claims. The survey revealed that Black customers had a 20% higher likelihood of having to communicate with a State Farm representative on at least three separate occasions before their claims were accepted. Additionally, they were more frequently asked to provide supplementary documentation for their claims. Another lawsuit, filed more recently by a former Indian American employee, accuses co-workers of racial harassment.

In 2019, Darryl Williams, an African American property owner, filed a discrimination lawsuit against State Farm, seeking class action certification. Williams had filed an insurance claim for damage caused by a burst pipe in one of his buildings. He felt that he was treated unfairly based on his race, as a State Farm claims adjuster reportedly expressed skepticism about his version of events, citing a high level of fraud in his area. State Farm eventually paid only a fraction of his claim, leading Williams to sell his buildings to cover his expenses.

Carla Campbell-Jackson, a former State Farm employee, filed a federal lawsuit in December, alleging discrimination, a hostile work environment, and retaliation. Campbell-Jackson came forward to support Darryl Williams&#x27; case, stating that State Farm had a system in place to minimize losses by classifying many claims as fraud in Black areas. State Farm has denied the accusations and states that recent allegations of discrimination do not reflect the company&#x27;s culture. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ruled in favor of Campbell-Jackson, determining that State Farm had discriminated against her. The EEOC recommended that State Farm pay Campbell-Jackson around $500,000 in damages and back pay, but no agreement has been reached.

=== Overcharging on premiums ===
An administrative law judge at the California Department of Insurance ordered State Farm to issue refunds and reduce rates after being found guilty of overcharging customers by $85 million. The judge concluded that State Farm&#x27;s premiums for homeowners insurance have been excessively high since July 15, 2015. The ruling orders State Farm to refund policyholders for overcharges collected after that date and reduce its homeowners insurance rates by 7 percent.

===Climate change===
Under CEO Michael L. Tipsord, State Farm has announced a Green Mission to &quot;lead by example&quot; in environmental philanthropy. Ceres has found that State Farm invests millions of US dollars to finance energy companies. Others place State Farm&#x27;s fossil fuel investments at US$22.4 million. State Farm was viewed as not considering climate change in their investments.

In order to rectify the situation and show its green credentials, State Farm has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030.
80% of State Farm facilities now have an Energy Star score of 75% or higher; this is significantly above the average for Fortune 50 companies.
=== LGBT ===
On May 24, 2022, State Farm ended its partnership with GenderCool, an organization that seeks to raise awareness of &quot;transgender and non-binary youth&quot;, after receiving backlash from right-wing and conservative political figures and media outlets.

=== Public backlash and social media ===
State Farm has faced controversies on social media platforms, particularly on Facebook, where several &quot;I Hate State Farm&quot; groups have emerged. These groups have become a focal point for customers and individuals expressing grievances and frustrations with the company&#x27;s services, policies, or claims handling.

On the Better Business Bureau&#x27;s website, a non-profit focused on advancing marketplace trust, State Farm has a customer review rating of 1.17/5, the average out of over 1,000 customer reviews.

<doc id="810865" wikidata="Q818804" url="?curid=810865" title="Berchem">
<text>Berchem () is a southern district of the municipality and city of Antwerp in the Flemish Region of Belgium. Berchem is located along the old &quot;Grote Steenweg&quot; (Dutch for &#x27;Big Paved Road&#x27;) that has connected Brussels to Antwerp for several centuries; the town borders the districts of Deurne, Borgerhout, Wilrijk and Antwerp and the municipality of Mortsel. Berchem itself consists of three quarters, &quot;Oud Berchem&quot;, &quot;Groenenhoek&quot; and &quot;Nieuw Kwartier&quot;.

The &#x27;Ring&#x27;, Antwerp&#x27;s circular motorway which follows the track of the former city defense walls, cuts Berchem in two parts, separating the urban inner city area of Oud-Berchem (&quot;intra muros&quot;) from the more residential and suburban areas Groenenhoek, Pulhof and Nieuw Kwartier (&quot;extra muros&quot;).

== Political structure ==
After the decentralization of Antwerp in 2000, Berchem became a semi-independent district with its own legislative body, the so-called Districtsraad (&quot;District Council&quot;), and its own executive college. The District Council includes 25 members, directly elected for six-year terms by popular vote. The executive college comprises six Aldermen (&quot;Districtsschepenen&quot;), including a District Mayor (&quot;Districtsburgemeester&quot;), who are installed by the District Council.

The Zurenborg area hosts a high concentration of Art Nouveau and other fin-de-siècle style townhouses, many built between 1894 and 1906. The main streets of interest are &quot;Cogels-Osylei&quot;, &quot;Transvaalstraat&quot;, and &quot;Waterloostraat&quot;. After the area was slated for demolition in the 1960s, to be replaced with a business and office complex, demolition was prevented when the area got monumental status in the 1980s. In recent years, the area has become an attraction for architecture-minded visitors.

The &quot;Driekoningenstraat - Statiestraat&quot; is the main shopping and commercial area of Berchem. Though suffering competition from suburban shopping centers, the retail highstreet still has an interesting mix of Belgian, local, and international convenience and non-food stores. The highstreet has recently been refurbished, giving more space to pedestrians.

The Groenenhoek is home to the Flemish Tram and Bus Museum.

== Transport ==
The railway station of Antwerpen-Berchem, located within the district, is the second largest station in the city of Antwerp. With a few exceptions, such as the Thalys high-speed train, almost all trains stopping in Antwerp have a stop at Antwerpen-Berchem station. The district of Berchem is also served by the Antwerp tram routes 4,7,9,11 and 15, and numerous bus lines, which connect Berchem with the bordering districts and communities, and are operated by the Flemish transport company De Lijn.

== Sports ==
The local football team is Koninklijk Berchem Sport.

<text>Crinum is a genus of about 180 species of perennial plants that have large showy flowers on leafless stems, and develop from bulbs. They are found in seasonally moist areas, including marshes, swamps, depressions and along the sides of streams and lakes in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide.

==Description==

===Vegetative characteristics===

&quot;Crinum&quot; are bulbous perennial herbs with tunicate bulbs and basal, glabrous, annual to perennial leaves.
===Generative characteristics===

The bisexual, sessile or pedicellate, zygomorphic or actinomorphic flowers are borne one umbellate or solitary inflorescences with solid scapes.

==Cytology==
Cytological studies have shown that 27 species of &quot;Crinum&quot; are diploid, having a typical chromosome count of 2n = 22. Abilio Fernandes found that the Orange River &quot;Crinum bulbispermum&quot; had a count of 2n = 66, and some desert &quot;Crinum macowanii&quot; 2n = 44. These polyploid species produce seeds that are often parthenogenetic triploid or diploids, lack vigour and seldom grow to mature plants.

==Taxonomy==
It was published by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The lectotype &quot;Crinum americanum&quot; was designated in 1923.
===Species===
, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families lists 105 species of &quot;Crinum&quot;. Amongst these are:

*&quot;Crinum americanum&quot; – southern swamplily, seven sisters
*&quot;Crinum asiaticum&quot; – poisonbulb
*&quot;Crinum bulbispermum&quot; – hardy swamplily
*&quot;Crinum latifolium&quot; 
*&quot;Crinum macowanii&quot; 
*&quot;Crinum moorei&quot; 
*&quot;Crinum pedunculatum&quot; , syn. &quot;C. asiaticum&quot; var. &quot;pedunculatum&quot; – swamplily, river lily or spider lily
*&quot;Crinum thaianum&quot; – onion plant
*&quot;Crinum viviparum&quot; – Indian Subcontinent to Indo-China

===Formerly placed here===
*&quot;Agapanthus africanus&quot; (as &quot;C. africanum&quot; )
*&quot;Ammocharis heterostyla&quot; (as &quot;C. heterostylum&quot; )
*&quot;Cyrtanthus angustifolius&quot; (as &quot;C. angustifolius&quot; )
*&quot;Cyrtanthus elatus&quot; (as &quot;C. speciosum&quot; )
*&quot;Cyrtanthus obliquus&quot; (as &quot;C. obliquum&quot; )
*&quot;Hippeastrum argentinum&quot; (as &quot;C. argentinum&quot; )
*&quot;Urceolina urceolata&quot; (as &quot;C. urceolatum&quot; )

=== Hybrids ===
*× &quot;Amarcrinum&quot; hybridised with Amaryllis
*&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;powellii&quot; (garden hybrid between &quot;C. bulbispermum&quot; and &quot;C. moorei&quot;) - pale pink, fragrant, lily-like flowers produced in late summer
**&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;powellii&quot; &#x27;Album&#x27; (white flowered cultivar)
===Etymology===
The generic name &quot;Crinum&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (krinon), meaning lily, via the Latin &quot;crinum&quot;. 

==Uses==
Several species are used in aquariums and in aquascaping. These include &quot;Crinum calamistratum&quot;, &quot;Crinum malabaricum&quot;, &quot;Crinum natans&quot;, and &quot;Crinum thaianum&quot;.

<doc id="810877" wikidata="Q15524762" url="?curid=810877" title="Michael Fish">
<text>Michael Fish (born 27 April 1944) is a British weather forecaster. From 1974 to 2004, he was a television presenter for BBC Weather.

==Career==
Fish was born on 27 April 1944 in Eastbourne, Sussex.
Educated at Osmington School then Eastbourne College and City University London, Fish was the longest-serving broadcast meteorologist on British television. He joined the Met Office in 1962 and started on BBC Radio in 1971, moving to the role on television in 1974.

Fish was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours. He was retired and made his final forecast on 6 October 2004 on the &quot;BBC Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; bulletin. In a specially extended report fellow forecaster Ian McCaskill paid tribute to Fish in stating that &quot;Michael is the last of the true weatherman you will ever see. Michael can actually interpret the skies – he can do the weather forecast the hard way: the old way that people don&#x27;t do any more, because nowadays most of the decisions are made by the computer.&quot;

That year, Fish was also awarded the TRIC Award for TV Weather Presenter of the Year and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; gave him the honour of &quot;National Treasure&quot;.

Michael Fish also co-authored a book with Paul Hudson and Ian McCaskill called &quot;Storm Force: Britain&#x27;s Wildest Weather&quot;, published in October 2007. He was awarded honorary degrees by City University London in 1996 and Exeter University in the summer of 2005.

More than eight years after retiring from the BBC national forecasts team, he made a return to regular forecasting, presenting a weekly weather forecast for Netweather.tv. He resumed forecasting on BBC South East Today, providing holiday cover for the regular forecaster and has also taken to acting. He is a patron of numerous organisations and charities. He has since retired from presenting his weekly forecast on Netweather.tv as announced on the 24 December 2021.

==Hurricane controversy==
A few hours before the Great Storm of 1987 broke, on 15 October 1987, Fish said during a televised weather forecast: &quot;Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way. Well, if you&#x27;re watching, don&#x27;t worry, there isn&#x27;t!&quot;. The storm was the worst to hit South East England for three centuries, causing record damage and killing 19 people.

In later years, Fish claimed that he had been referring to that year&#x27;s Atlantic Hurricane Floyd affecting the Florida Keys at the time, in a link to a news story in the BBC One O&#x27;Clock News that preceded the weather bulletin. But he did not mention Florida in the weather, which was made amid widespread worries about a coming storm: that morning, the &quot;Surrey Mirror&quot; had warned of &quot;furious gales&quot;. He did go on to warn of high winds for the UK, although the storm that actually occurred was far stronger than he had predicted, albeit technically not a hurricane. 15 years later he commented that if he were given a penny for every mention of that episode of The Weather, he would be a millionaire. In 2012, a clip of the bulletin was shown as part of a video montage in the London 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.

In reaction to the controversy, the term &quot;the Michael Fish effect&quot; has been coined, whereby British weather forecasters are now inclined to predict &quot;a worst-case scenario in order to avoid being caught out&quot;. The term &quot;Michael Fish moment&quot; is applied to public forecasts, on any topic, which turn out to be embarrassingly wrong.

Fish said in a BBC interview that there was actually no woman caller who phoned in to the BBC regarding the storm, although over the years many have claimed to be her. It was in fact a white lie he made up himself, as a colleague in the studio told him his mother in Wales was going to Florida and mentioned that she had heard there was a storm coming, so he thought it would be a good opening line to start the weather with.

==Personality and popular culture==
Fish had a record dedicated to him in 1985 by the punk group Rachel and Nicki called &quot;I wish, I wish, he was like Michael Fish&quot;. This was featured on &quot;Wogan&quot;.
In 2012, Fish worked with a fashion company to coordinate a BASE jump from a block of flats in central London to raise awareness of climate change.

In 2017 Fish partnered with Fullers Brewery for a campaign called #Whenitrainsitpours which gave Twitter followers a free pint of London Pride each time it rained in London.

Fish lives in Twickenham, south western Greater London.

==Other television appearances==
Fish appeared on dozens of other television programmes, ranging from scientific broadcasts to comedy shows and quizzes. He was on BBC2&#x27;s game show &quot;Identity&quot; on 3 September 2007 as a TV weather forecaster. On 14 October 2007, he appeared on Radio 4&#x27;s Sunday news review &quot;Broadcasting House&quot; as a guest newspaper reviewer and delivered the weather forecast at the end of the programme.

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Great Storm, Fish returned to deliver the weather forecast on the BBC&#x27;s One O&#x27;Clock and Six O&#x27;Clock news on 15 October 2007.

Fish mentioned briefly on Big Brother&#x27;s Bit on the Side on 16 August 2018 as the series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 22&quot; is named &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;. On 18 July 2022, Fish appeared live in the studio on BBC2s Newsnight for a discussion about the heatwave implications with Presenter Kirsty Wark. Fish repeated he had been advocating more use of Nuclear Energy since the 1970s and hadn&#x27;t changed his view.

===St Jude storm===
The St Jude storm, also known as Storm Christian, was a severe European wind storm that struck north western Europe on 27 October 2013. Michael Fish was widely quoted, this time telling the public that people should delay going into work if hurricane-force winds hit their area.

<text>The Fiat Stilo (Type 192) is a small family car available as a three- and a five-door hatchback, as well as an estate (Fiat Stilo Multi Wagon), produced by Italian automaker Fiat. The Stilo hatchbacks were presented in March 2001 at the Bologna Motor Show, and launched on European market in October 2001 to replace the Fiat Bravo/Brava, with the Stilo Multi Wagon following in January 2003.

The Fiat Bravo was the successor of the Stilo in most markets, however, the five-door Stilo continued to be manufactured in Brazil until October 2010, when it too was replaced by the Bravo.

The Stilo came in third place in the European Car of the Year awards for 2002, behind the Peugeot 307 and Renault Laguna.

==Overview==


The Stilo&#x27;s styling received mixed reviews, with many journalists and enthusiasts criticising it as being too bland and too German looking, as the styling of the preceding Bravo and Brava had been criticised for being too &quot;Italian&quot;. As with many of its European competitors, the five-door was less sporty than the coupé-like three-door bodystyle, with a higher roofline and a more upright appearance overall.

Critics also attacked the car&#x27;s excessive weight and its semi-independent rear torsion beam suspension / twist-beam rear suspension, however, this was the same system used by the market-leading Volkswagen Golf of the time. Some saw the torsion beam as a step backwards from the acclaimed fully-independent rear suspension used in the Bravo/Brava and Fiat Coupé. The Stilo was the second car worldwide to use the TRW Column-Drive Electric Power-Assisted Steering (EPS) technology after the second generation Fiat Punto, later introduced on the 2003 Nissan Micra and Renault Mégane. As the model range aged, the range of available options was reduced.

However, when pushed the Stilo resists understeer, although arguably its soft spring and damper rate dull the experience. The engine range, particularly the 1.2-litre petrol, was also generally criticised for being underpowered. However, the 1.6 version is the last iteration of the old Fiat 128 SOHC engine which provided strong performance.

The car&#x27;s fuel economy was also seen as poor for its class, a result of the car&#x27;s weight. Another point of criticism was the Selespeed gearbox fitted to the Abarth version: this was seen as too slow in its reactions and particularly inappropriate for this high powered version. Nevertheless, the car won praise for its high levels of grip (aided by the unusually wide tires) and its brakes.

In the United Kingdom, different trim levels available were: Active, Active Aircon, Blue, Dynamic, Sporting, Abarth, GT, Prestigio, Xbox limited edition, Michael Schumacher, and the Schumacher GP, with general modifications by British car specialists, Prodrive.

The Stilo was originally offered in some markets with a radar assisted cruise control option; it included sensors in the front bumper and rear of the car to adjust the speed of the car according to other vehicles&#x27; speed. This was soon dropped as it became apparent that interference was creating undesired results.

A keyless entry, named &#x27;Easy Go&#x27;, push-button start, similar in function to Citroën&#x27;s, Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s and BMW Mini&#x27;s systems, was also an available option. For MY2006 in September 2005, the Stilo was updated with a new front grille, different seat fabric, a relocation of the electric mirror controls from the window control console to just behind the gear stick.

The entry models also had the centre armrest removed (which when in the downward position prevented comfortable use of the handbrake as in the Audi A3) and the deletion of the rear air vent.

The Stilo was ultimately a sales disappointment. An extensive advertising campaign using Formula 1 star Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello did little to aid the car&#x27;s sales. In October 2013, &quot;The Economist&quot; placed the Stilo into the report on &quot;Europe&#x27;s Biggest Loss Making Cars&quot;.

In 2004, the Stilo received a light facelift. The 1242 cc engine was dropped in favour of the Punto&#x27;s 1.4-liter unit, increasing the car&#x27;s power to , again combined with the six-speed gearbox. Also, the taillights were altered, and the Abarth version gained a traditional manual gearbox, instead of the &quot;Selespeed&quot;.

===Specifications===
The original engine and gearbox combinations were:
* 1242 cc DOHC sixteen valve engine that also powered the Punto and Lancia Ypsilon, with an output of combined with a six-speed manual gearbox
* 1.6 L with a five-speed manual gearbox (also offered with a six-speed manual gearbox)
* 1.8 L, again with a five-speed manual gearbox
* five cylinder, 2.4 L engine, combined with Fiat&#x27;s Selespeed five-speed automated manual gearbox, similar to the gearbox used on the Alfa Romeo 147 and Alfa Romeo 156
* 1.9 JTD unit with or 
* 8 valve, 1.9 MultiJet with or 
* 16 valve 1.9 MultiJet with or 

==Safety==
The Fiat Stilo passed the Euro NCAP car safety tests, with following ratings:
==Motorsport==
A Group N version of the car was developed by Abarth to compete in the single-make trophy called &quot;Trofeo Stilo Abarth&quot;, held in Italy from 2002 to 2005. The car was revealed in November 2001, at the Bologna Motor Show.

It was derived from the Stilo 1.8 16v version, with the engine power increased from to , and from the season of 2003 to . A similar competition was held in the United Kingdom from 2004 to 2005, called the Fiat Stilo Rally Cup.

In September 2004, a junior team backed up by Fiat UK competed in the Wales Rally GB of the World Rally Championship with group A cars, and the following year two other cars took part in the rally. Stilo cars have also been present in the Andros Trophy during the last years.

==Marketing==

===South America===

Only available in the five-door hatchback version, the Stilo was launched in South America in 2003, being assembled in Brazil. The engines were the Family I GM engines 1.8 L with eight valves and or 16 valves and , and a 2.4-liter, twenty valve five-cylinder version with for the Abarth model as well.

For export, the chosen engines were the Italian made 1.8 16v VIS engine with and the 1.9 JTD Diesel of specially for Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. Chile did not get the JTD, but was the only country in the region to receive the Italian-made three-door and Multi Wagon versions. Diesel cars were not legally available to Brazilian private car buyers.

A Schumacher special edition of the Stilo was added in 2004 and lasted until 2006; contrary to the European version, which was based on the three-door version and equipped with the 2.4 twenty valve engine, the Brazilian was only available with five doors and the Family I GM 1.8 16v engine with .

In 2006, the Stilo gained a GM sourced flexible engine capable of using petrol and ethanol (1.8 8v with on petrol and with ethanol) and the 1.8 16v engine was retired. In the Americas, the Stilo was partially replaced by the new Bravo at the end of 2010, when it will be built in Brazil; from 2007 on the Italian import is available in Chile and Venezuela.

Fiat Automóveis introduced a facelifted Stilo in the end of January 2008, in which the Dualogic automated manual gearbox was released, being available to every version with the 1.8 8v Flex engine, which now produces (petrol) or when using ethanol as fuel. The car also got minor cosmetic changes to front grille, bonnet, side bumpers and to the taillights, in order to end its production cycle, which is expected to happen in 2010.

For the MY2009, Fiat withdrew the Abarth version from the market in Brazil; the version wasn&#x27;t available in other markets anymore. For the MY2010, Fiat do Brasil launched a &quot;basic features&quot; version called &quot;Attractive&quot;, still with the 1.8 8v Flex engine. This version marks the confirmation that the new Bravo is coming, with the low-cost Stilo Attractive as the only version.

In March 2010, Brazil&#x27;s Justice Ministry fined Fiat three million Reais (US$1.7 million) for failing to recall its Stilo without ABS brakes to fix a rear wheel problem that may have caused thirty accidents and eight deaths. Fiat denied any wrongdoing, saying that the rear wheel problem was not the cause of the accidents, but rather caused by them.

== Sales and production ==
769,000 Stilo were produced, including 102,662 in Brazil.

The Stilo has been a big failure for Fiat, as the company expected to reach production to 400,000 annual units.

Overall, due to insufficient sales, Fiat lost an estimated €2,730 per vehicle produced.

<doc id="810885" wikidata="Q525728" url="?curid=810885" title="Sod">
<text>Sod is the upper layer of turf that is harvested for transplanting. Turf consists of a variable thickness of a soil medium that supports a community of turfgrasses.

In British and Australian English, sod is more commonly known as &quot;turf&quot;, and the word &quot;sod&quot; is limited mainly to agricultural senses.

== Uses ==
Sod is generally used for lawns, golf courses, and sports stadiums around the world. In residential construction, it is sold to landscapers, home builders or home owners who use it to establish a lawn quickly and avoid soil erosion. Sod can be used to repair a small area of lawn, golf course, or athletic field that has died and is used as a quicker alternative to re-growing a lawn from seed. Sod is also effective in increasing cooling, improving air and water quality, and assisting in flood prevention by draining water.

Scandinavia has a long history of employing sod roofing and a traditional house type is the Icelandic turf house.

In the United States, following the passage of the Homestead Act by Congress in 1862, settlers in the Great Plains used sod bricks to build entire sod houses. This was effective because the prairie sod of the Great Plains was so dense and difficult to cut it earned the nickname &quot;Nebraska marble&quot;. Blacksmith John Deere made his fortune when he became the first to make a plow that could reliably cut the prairie sod.

Different types of grass are used for sod installation.

== Cultivation ==
Sod is grown on specialist farms. For 2009, the United States Department of Agriculture reported 1,412 farms had of sod in production.

It is usually grown locally (within 100 miles of the target market) to minimize both the cost of transport and also the risk of damage to the product. The farms that produce this grass may have many varieties of grass grown in one location to best suit the consumer&#x27;s use and preference of appearance.

It is usually harvested 10 to 18 months after planting, depending on the growing climate. On the farm, it undergoes fertilization, frequent mowing, watering, and subsequent vacuuming to remove the clippings. It is harvested using specialized equipment, precision cut to standardized sizes. Sod is typically harvested in small square or rectangular slabs, or large rolls.

The Mississippi State University has developed a hydroponic method of cultivating sod. For the very few sod farms that export turf internationally, this soilless sod may travel both lighter and better than traditional sod. Additionally, since the sod is not grown in soil, it does not need to be washed clean of soil down to the bare roots (or sprigs), so time to export is shortened.

== Immediacy ==

In many applications, such as erosion control and athletic fields, immediacy is a key factor. Seed may be blown about by the wind, eaten by birds, or fail because of drought. It takes some weeks to form a visually appealing lawn and further time before it is robust enough for use. Sod largely avoids these problems, and with proper care, newly laid sod is usually fully functional within 30 days of installation and its root system is comparable to that of a seeding lawn two to three years older. Sod also reduces erosion by stabilizing the soil.

Many prized cultivars (such as Bella Bluegrass, a brand-named dwarf variant of Kentucky Bluegrass) can only be reproduced vegetatively rather than sexually (via seed). For these, sod cultivation is the only means of producing additional plants. To grow these varieties for sale, turf farms use a technique called sprigging, where recently harvested sod mats are cut into slender rows and replanted in the field.

== Species used ==

=== Fescue grass ===

==== Tall fescue ====
Tall fescue (&quot;Festuca&quot; spp.) is a cool-weather group of grasses originating in Europe, commonly used as sod. It is moderately tolerant to both drought and cold, and as such is especially popular in inland temperate environments referred to in the turf and landscaping industries as the &quot;transition zone&quot;, where summers are too hot for most cool-weather grasses, yet winters are too cold for most warm-weather grasses. Fescue is well-adapted to clay soils, moderately shade-tolerant, and somewhat resistant to disease, yet vulnerable to the diseases brown patch and Fusarium patch. It grows most actively (and thus provides the most desirable appearance) in spring and fall, and requires frequent watering during summer. Due to its bunch-type growth habit (unique among common sod grasses), it will not spread undesirably or invade adjacent areas once sodded, yet neither will it fill in voids, and periodic maintenance (such as overseeding with Fescue seed) may be required to sustain a homogeneous surface. It has poor wear tolerance compared to Bermuda grass, making it less popular for applications such as athletic fields.

==== Fine fescues ====
Fine fescues (&quot;F. rubra&quot;, &quot;F. ovina&quot;, &quot;F. trichophylla&quot;) are less popular as sod than the tall fescues. As their names suggest, they exhibit much thinner leaf blades, and tolerate lower mowing heights than the tall fescues. They may be somewhat more resistant to common diseases. Otherwise, their characteristics are similar. Fine fescues are generally used in mixtures with other grasses.

=== Bermuda grass ===
Bermuda grass is quite commonly used for golf courses and sports fields across the southern portions of the United States. It tolerates a range of climates in the U.S., from hot and humid lagoons, inlets, and bays of the Gulf Coast, to the arid expanses of terrain like plains and deserts in the Southwest and parts of the Lower Midwest. Established bermuda grass is a network of shoots, rhizomes, stolons, and crown tissue together that usually form a dense plant canopy. This dense plant canopy can be used to propagate clonal varieties by sod, sprigs, or plugs. The aggressive and resilient nature of Bermuda grass makes it not only an excellent turfgrass but also a challenging and invasive weed in land cultivated for other purposes. Its one noted weakness is its relatively low tolerance of shade. Given the economic importance of Bermuda grass (as a sod product, agricultural forage, and, at times, as an invasive weed), it has been the subject of numerous studies.
Celebration Bermuda grass:
:Celebration Bermuda grass is a dark–green, fine–textured, aggressive, traffic–tolerant cultivar with high recuperative potential and drought tolerance.&quot; The cultivar is a breed of &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot; from Australia developed by turfgrass breeder Rod Riley. The grass has a distinctive deep blue–green color which makes it popular on golf courses and for private home lawns throughout the southern United States. As a leading cultivar, the research on the grass is extensive. The grass was rated for the best shade tolerance by the United States Golf Association. A researcher at the University of Florida noted this cultivar&#x27;s, &quot;good wear tolerance, quality, and color ratings&quot; in the Central Florida environment. The grass was the overall best–performing turfgrass in a two-year drought resistance study commissioned by the San Antonio Water System and performed by Texas A &amp; M extension service. The cultivar was also the top–rated Bermuda grass for drought resistance in a test conducted in South Carolina. Along with many golf courses across the southern United States, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers elected to install Celebration Bermudagrass in their stadium.
Discovery Bermuda grass:
:Discovery is a Bermuda grass that has an exceptional dark blue-green color. It also has extremely slow vertical growth which means that it only needs to be mowed once a month. Discovery has the drought resistance of a Bermuda grass but does not need to be maintained as much as other varieties. It was developed in Europe. It was made available in the United States in 2011 by Sod Solutions which owns the right to market it in the United States. It grows well in all of the southern United States.

===Bluegrass===
Bella Bluegrass:
:Bella Bluegrass was developed by the University of Nebraska as a drought-resistant grass that would help states conserve water. It was immediately embraced by schools and homeowners in Utah who are trying to conserve water. Bella is the world&#x27;s first dwarf, vegetative bluegrass. It is sold only as sod, not as seed. Bella is a quick grower laterally but has very minimal vertical growth. Because it only grows to about 4 inches in height, it requires less mowing. It grows in sand, clay, muck, and peat soils, and it is currently being adopted across the northern United States.

=== St. Augustine grass ===
St. Augustine grass (&quot;Stenotaphrum secundatum&quot;) (also known as Charleston grass in South Carolina and Buffalo Turf in Australia) is warm-season, perennial grass that is a widely used. A native grass of tropical origin that extends from marshes (salt and freshwater), lagoon fringes, and sandy beach ridges.

St. Augustine lawns are a popular coarse, wide–bladed coarse lawn planted throughout many areas of the Southeastern United States This grass is found in Mexico, Australia, and in tropical parts of Africa. It is a warm-season grass that does not handle cold weather very well. The majority of this grass is planted in vegetative forms (such as plugs and sod), as seeds are not usually available due to production difficulties.

Captiva St. Augustine:
:Developed by the University of Florida in 2007, Captiva is a chinch bug resistant St. Augustine cultivar. It has a lush, dark-green color with a dense canopy and a massive root system. Because it has a slow leaf-blade growth and lateral spread, the requirement for mowing is reduced. Captiva has a good–excellent shade tolerance and has excellent pest resistance which means there is less need to use pesticides.

=== Centipedegrass ===
Covington:
:Centipedegrass was introduced into the United States from southeastern Asia in 1916. It does well in the climate and soils of central and northern Florida and is the most common home lawn grass in the Florida Panhandle. Covington is a proprietary cultivar of centipede grass from Sod Solutions that grows in the southeast United States, from the west half of Texas to all of Louisiana, most of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. It is the only uniformly green centipede grass on the market. It is a low-maintenance grass, which retains its color in the fall and greens quickly in the spring. This variety is currently being evaluated by the University of Florida.
Santee:
:Santee grass is another new proprietary selection from Sod Solutions, which is also being evaluated by the University of Florida for adaptation to Florida use.

== Wildflower turf ==
Wildflower turf is a type of lawn alternative that is made up of a mixture of wildflower seeds. These seeds are sown together and grow to form a lawn of flowers, rather than the traditional monoculture of grass found in a traditional lawn. Wildflower turf can be a low-maintenance and sustainable alternative to traditional lawns, as well as providing a habitat for beneficial insects and other wildlife. They often require less watering and fertilization than traditional lawns. Wildflower turf can be used in the restoration of natural habitats, such as meadows, prairies, and wetlands. It is used on green roofs to provide a low-maintenance alternative to traditional green roof systems. Wildflower turf can help to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change and to purify the air by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen.

== Natural turf communities ==
Low growing vegetation is referred to as &quot;turf communities&quot; in areas where such growth is not common, as in moss-turf communities of sub Antarctica, some epifauna in the sea, coral reefs and, in New Zealand, as species-rich communities of plants under tall, on coastal headlands, dune hollows, rivers and lakes, where most of the natural cover was forest. A form of turf community is a herbfield.

==Diseases==
Turfgrasses suffer from a wide number of fungal diseases; In 2023, Lane &quot;et al.&quot;, provided a sampling methodology for testing.

<text>In the Battle of Mookerheyde, Spanish forces defeated Dutch forces composed of German mercenaries, on 14 April 1574, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War on the heath (&quot;heide&quot; in modern Dutch) near the village Mook and the river Meuse, not far from Nijmegen in Gelderland. Two leaders of the Dutch forces, brothers of William the Silent, were killed: Louis of Nassau (born 1538) and Henry of Nassau-Dillenburg (born 1550).

During the winter of 1573/74, Louis and Henry of Nassau raised a mercenary army in Germany of 6500 infantry and 3000 cavalry. They proceeded towards Maastricht to rendezvous with their elder brother William the Silent, Prince of Orange, who led 6000 Dutchmen. They planned to march their combined forces toward Leiden, which had been under siege by a large Spanish force since October 1573.

The strength of Count Louis&#x27; forces diminished en route. More than a thousand men deserted and seven hundred were killed by the Spanish in a night attack. The remaining troops were mutinous because the Dutch had been unable to pay them. Louis crossed the Meuse with only 5,500 infantry and 2,600 cavalry. Before Louis could join forces with William, Luis de Requesens temporarily lifted the siege of Leiden so that his 5,000 infantry and 800 cavalry could counter Louis&#x27; advance. The Spanish army was led by Sancho d&#x27;Avila and Bernardino de Mendoza. The armies met near the village of Mook. Well timed attacks by the Spanish lancers destroyed the Dutch cavalry and the Spanish proved victorious.

The Dutch suffered a disastrous defeat, losing at least 3,000 men. The Dutch army of mercenaries, still not paid, soon dispersed. William long hoped that his brothers had been captured, but Louis and Henry were apparently killed and their bodies were never recovered.

The Spanish then resumed the siege of Leiden, which failed when Dutch forces relieved the city in October, with the use of a rebel fleet and much assistance from the incoming sea as dykes were breached to flood the low-lying land.

In the course of the battle, Spanish forces seized the command baton that William the Silent had given his brother Louis. The baton, long forgotten, was discovered at the Jesuit residence in San Cugat in Catalonia. In 2017, the General Superior of the Jesuits, Arturo Sosa, returned the baton to King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands in a ceremony at the Vatican. The transfer was symbolic, in that ownership of the baton is retained by Catalonia as part of its cultural and historic patrimony. The baton had passed to the Jesuits as part of the estate of Luis de Requesens, Governor General of the Spanish Netherlands in 1574. The Dutch plan to display it at the National Military Museum.

<doc id="810897" wikidata="Q339626" url="?curid=810897" title="Spacehog">
<text>Spacehog is an alternative rock band formed in 1994 in New York City by four British men who were living in the city. Their music is heavily influenced by David Bowie, Queen, and T. Rex. The band&#x27;s best-known single is &quot;In the Meantime&quot;.

==History==
Though all the band members are from Leeds, West Yorkshire, Spacehog was formed in New York City. Antony Langdon met Jonny Cragg by chance in a café where Cragg supposedly had a job killing rats. Soon after, Langdon&#x27;s brother Royston joined the band, and Spacehog was born. The band&#x27;s original guitarist, Robert Curreri, was asked to leave the band, and Cragg&#x27;s friend Richard Steel replaced him in 1994. The band signed in 1994 with Seymour Stein to Sire Records.

On 24 October 1995, Spacehog released its first album, &quot;Resident Alien&quot;. It went gold on the Billboard charts, selling over 500,000 copies and spawned the hit single and video &quot;In the Meantime&quot; as well as the single &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot;. &quot;In the Meantime&quot; received heavy video and radio play and was used as background music to BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot; football programme. The band performed the song on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;TFI Friday&quot; in 1996. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Chinese Album&quot;, was released on 10 March 1998. Though it did not sell as well as &quot;Resident Alien&quot;, the band&#x27;s popularity continued to increase as Spacehog opened for more popular acts such as Pearl Jam and Supergrass. &quot;The Chinese Album&quot; had a more &quot;artsy&quot; sound, with the Pink Floyd-like piano on the opening track and Michael Stipe of R.E.M. contributing vocals to the song &quot;Almond Kisses&quot;.

After the band was dropped by Elektra Records, Spacehog signed with the upstart label Artemis Records and released its third album, &quot;The Hogyssey&quot;, on 10 April 2001. The album continued the band&#x27;s neo-glam approach and included the singles &quot;I Want to Live&quot; and &quot;At Least I Got Laid&quot;, as well as a funk version of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;. The band joined The Black Crowes and Oasis on the Tour of Brotherly Love in support of the album, which proved to be the band&#x27;s final major tour for several years.

Royston Langdon and American actress Liv Tyler became engaged in February 2001, and married in Barbados on 25 March 2003. In December 2004, she gave birth to their son, Milo William Langdon. On 8 May 2008, the couple confirmed through representatives that they would be separating but remain friends.

===Arckid===
Antony, Royston, and Christian Langdon then pooled their resources to form Arckid. By June 2006, they had recorded eight songs with Bryce Goggin at Trout Studios in Brooklyn. Jonny Cragg joined The Twenty-Twos as their drummer post-Spacehog, but has since rejoined the Langdon brothers in Arckid.

At the end of November 2006, Antony Langdon left Arckid on good terms and had devised an alter ego known as &quot;Louis Arogant&quot;. This project was near completion as a record entitled &quot;Victoria&quot;: an homage to Langdon&#x27;s love for his wife, the director Victoria Clay de Mendoza. The album was intended to release at the end of 2007 but was never released. He also continued in the production of his television work. Also in the works was an album by Antony Langdon and Joaquin Phoenix. The project was called &quot;This Lady Is a Tramp&quot; and was being mixed by Paul McKenna with help from Creation Records founder Alan McGee and the Charlatans’ Tim Burgess.

Antony Langdon was briefly replaced in Arckid by Your Vegas guitarist Mat Steel, who subsequently left Arckid after they shot their first video to rejoin Your Vegas. Pete Denton of Cube and Kid Symphony fame joined Arckid for a short period of time. Richard Steel accompanied the three members of Arckid on stage during the Hilfiger Sessions NY and the 2007 Lollapalooza gigs.

===Reunion===
In July 2008, Spacehog reunited to play two shows, the first at the Viper Room and the second at Troubador. Drummer Jonny Cragg posted on the Arckid MySpace page that Spacehog would be reuniting and would begin work on a new record. In July 2009, Spacehog reunited at Spaceland in Los Angeles.

===&quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;===
In 2010, Spacehog guitarist Antony Langdon gained notoriety for his role in the controversial mockumentary &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Langdon, who was one of Phoenix&#x27;s assistants as well as a musical partner, staged a falling-out with the actor during the documentary&#x27;s filming and is shown defecating on the troubled actor in retaliation for an earlier argument. In an earlier part of the film, there is a similarly shocking scene involving Langdon getting out of the shower.

Langdon&#x27;s time in Spacehog is not mentioned in the film, but a clip of the band performing on television is shown. Royston Langdon is also credited for one of the film&#x27;s songs.

The film&#x27;s cinematographer, Magdalena Gorka, sued director Casey Affleck for multiple complaints. She alleged Antony Langdon, who worked as the camera assistant, was one of the crew members who subjected her to &quot;routine instances&quot; of sexual harassment.

===&quot;As It Is on Earth&quot;===
On 17 September 2011, Spacehog announced the completion of their latest album, &quot;As It Is on Earth&quot;, on their MySpace page. It was released on 16 April 2013.

<text>Harry Rankin (May 8, 1920 – February 26, 2002) was a Vancouver lawyer and long term member of the Vancouver City Council.

==Early years==
Rankin was born Harry Riffkin in Vancouver to secular Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. His father worked at a factory while his mother grew up in Glasgow&#x27;s working class Jewish community.

At 14, Rankin dropped out of secondary school to work in a bakery and through the trade union he got involved in politics. During World War Two he served in the Canadian Army with Vancouver&#x27;s Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. He attained the rank of sergeant and was wounded on 23 May 1944 during the Battle of the Hitler Line.

Rankin married a Jewish divorcee, and they had a son, Phil Rankin, who went on to become a Vancouver lawyer.

A documentary film, the Rankin File, was premiered in 2018, which was a biography and a background to the 1986 Vancouver mayoral election between Harry Rankin and Gordon Campbell.

==Law==
After the war he completed his secondary education and pursued undergraduate studies at the University of British Columbia, where he also earned a law degree. During his time at U.B.C., he joined the Communist University Club, briefly serving as its vice-president.

Communists were banned from joining the bar and the Law Society of British Columbia interviewed Rankin at length prior to admitting him to the bar about his views on God, whether he would defend his country if attacked, and whether he was a member of the Communist Party of Canada, then called the Labor-Progressive Party, something he was able to deny as the Communist University Club was an independent and unaffiliated organization. In the wake of the Law Society refusing to admit Gordon Martin to the bar on account of his being an avowed communist, Rankin had to sign a declaration that he was not a communist prior to being allowed to join. He went on to become head of the Law Society in 1979 (a position then known as Treasurer, later known as President).

As a lawyer, Rankin fought for and helped establish the province&#x27;s legal aid system. In 1950 he was one of the founding members of a committee that created a list of lawyers who were willing to take on cases, mostly pro bono, preceding the establishment of the BC Legal Aid Society by 20 years.

Rankin worked as a criminal lawyer and labour lawyer, and he spent a significant amount of time working for First Nations clients, most notably in the much-publicised case of Fred Quilt.

==Politics==
Rankin ran for office more than a dozen times before being elected to the Vancouver City Council in 1966 as the sole independent alderman on a council dominated by the conservative Non-Partisan Association. Vancouver&#x27;s aldermen were elected through an &quot;at large&quot; system rather than by ward meaning voters from wealthier neighbourhoods were able to monopolise council elections and that only candidates who could afford a citywide campaign had a chance of being elected. Rankin helped form the Committee of Progressive Electors (COPE) as a left wing civic political party and it subsequently pushed for a ward-based electoral system to be introduced in Vancouver, culminating in a referendum in October 1973, at which the ward proposal was defeated.

Rankin was a 20-year veteran of city council when he ran for mayor in 1986, losing to Gordon Campbell. He returned to city council as an alderman in the subsequent election and remained on the body until his retirement from politics in 1993.

He died on February 26, 2002, from a heart attack, aged 81.

Rankin&#x27;s widow, Connie Fogal, is the former leader of the Canadian Action Party. Rankin&#x27;s son, Phil Rankin, continues in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a lawyer and advocate for legal aid. His grandson, Micah Rankin, is a law professor at Thompson Rivers University. His nephew, Lee Rankin is a lawyer and was a long-time councillor in Burnaby, British Columbia and was a federal Liberal candidate in 2000 and a BC Liberal candidate in the 2009 provincial election.

<doc id="810906" wikidata="Q5472019" url="?curid=810906" title="Fort Shafter">
<text>Fort Shafter is a census-designated place located in the City and County of Honolulu, Hawai‘i. It is the headquarters of the United States Army Pacific, which commands most Army forces in the Asia-Pacific region with the exception of Korea. Geographically, Fort Shafter extends up the interfluve (ridgeline) between Kalihi and Moanalua valleys, as well as onto the coastal plain (as Shafter Flats) at Māpunapuna. A portion of the area is also known as the Palm Circle Historic District; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been further designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark. It is also known as Palm Circle or 100 Area.

==History==
Fort Shafter is the oldest military base on Oahu and celebrated its 100th birthday on 22 June 2007.

Fort Shafter has been home to the senior Army headquarters in Hawaii for a century. Construction began in 1905 on the ahupua&#x27;a of Kahauiki, former Hawaiian crown lands that were ceded to the United States government after annexation. When the post opened in 1907, it was named for Major General William Rufus Shafter (1835–1906), who led the United States expedition to Cuba in 1898.

Palm Circle was laid out as a cantonment for an infantry battalion. The barracks and officers&#x27; quarters were arranged around a parade field ringed by royal palms. The first unit stationed at the new post was the 2d Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment.

Fort Shafter gradually spread out from Palm Circle. Tripler General Hospital once stood where the highway intersection is today (the hospital moved to its present location in 1948). In 1914, a regimental-sized cantonment area was constructed (near Richardson Theater). The Hawaiian Ordnance Depot was built in 1917 as a separate post (near today&#x27;s post exchange). In 1921, the Hawaiian Department moved to Fort Shafter from downtown Honolulu. Finally, a new area was constructed in 1940 for Signal Corps elements. 

War came to Fort Shafter on 7 December 1941, where the Hawaiian Department commander, Lieutenant General Walter C. Short, occupied Quarters 5. One soldier, Corporal Arthur A. Favreau, 64th Coast Artillery (Anti-Aircraft), was killed on post by an errant Navy shell. Fort Shafter became a busy headquarters and the barracks on Palm Circle were converted to offices. The major headquarters was named successively U.S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area (1943–44); U.S. Army Forces, Pacific Ocean Areas (1944–45); and U.S. Army Forces, Middle Pacific (1945–47). In 1944, the Army Corps of Engineers erected the &quot;Pineapple Pentagon&quot; (buildings T-100, T-101, and T-102) in just 49 days. Two large fishponds were filled in to form Shafter Flats.

For most of the time since the Second World War, Fort Shafter has remained the senior Army headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region. In 1947, the headquarters was renamed U.S. Army, Pacific. The post continued to adapt to meet the Army&#x27;s evolving requirements. In the early 1960s it was split in two by the new Moanalua Freeway. In 1974, when the headquarters was eliminated, Fort Shafter became home to U.S. Army Support Command, Hawaii, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pacific Ocean Division (relocated from Fort Armstrong, (Hawaii)). In 1979, the Army established U.S. Army Western Command, which was renamed U.S. Army, Pacific in 1990. In 1983, the Army conveyed to the State of Hawaii of undeveloped land on the northern end of post. Today Fort Shafter remains the focal point for command, control, and support of Army forces in the Asia-Pacific region; it includes an underground command center beneath Palm Circle.

==Education==
Hawaii Department of Education operates public schools. As of 2016 zoned schools are Shafter Elementary School, Moanalua Middle School, and Moanalua High School.

<doc id="810917" wikidata="Q1881681" url="?curid=810917" title="MOLLE">
<text>Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment, or MOLLE (pronounced ), is the current generation of load-bearing equipment used by a number of NATO armed forces, especially the British Army and the United States Army since the late 1990s. MOLLE uses Pouch Attachment Ladder System (PALS) webbing – rows of heavy-duty nylon stitched onto the gear – to attach equipment. This method has found use on civilian gear, and as a result, the term MOLLE is used outside the military for PALS-type webbing. 

The system&#x27;s modularity results from the PALS allowing for the attachment of various compatible pouches and accessories. This method of attachment has become a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for modular tactical gear, replacing the all-purpose lightweight individual carrying equipment (ALICE) system used in the earliest modular vest systems, which is still in use with many police forces.

== History ==

Even before the introduction of MOLLE, a light system of load-carrying equipment had been developed. Known as the Individual Integrated Fighting System (IIFS) and also LBV-88, it was intended to replace the older All-Purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE). The IIFS had its roots in the vests used by US Navy SEALS and other special operations forces in Vietnam. Developed at Natick, it consisted of the Individual Tactical Load Bearing Vest (ITLBV) and the Field Pack, Large, Internal Frame (FPLIF). A modified version of the combat field pack from the old Vietnam-era M1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment (MLCE) was adopted for use in the system. Designated the Combat Patrol Pack, it was actually used as a three-day pack for training purposes. The IIFS was meant to be a replacement for the ALICE system in infantry units, though it was intended for ALICE to be used in most others. Attached to the vest were four ammunition pockets for holding 30-round magazines for the M16 rifle. Though the IIFS did not live up to its expected purpose, it did lay the groundwork for future equipment.

MOLLE was developed at Natick labs in the mid-1990s following the IIFS&#x27;s introduction. Army leadership believed that the PALS system now presented an opportunity to completely change the way equipment was made. It was conceived as a lighter and more durable system for carrying equipment, and would lighten the soldier&#x27;s load. The MOLLE system was introduced in 1997, but did not see widespread issue until after the September 11 attacks in 2001, and was used by U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. Early criticisms of the MOLLE system emerged, particularly from the Army. Many of these criticisms have centered on the sustainment-load pack and frame, due to the external plastic frame being too fragile and subject to breaking in the field (since mitigated), that the zippers have a tendency to burst when stuffed full and that the pack&#x27;s straps lack sufficient length to be used with bulky body armor. The first generation of this system used a ball and socket joint between the frame and rucksack belt (which in itself formed the waistbelt of the MOLLE vest). This method led to numerous lower back injuries due to the ball (mounted on the frame) missing the socket on the waistbelt and hurting the user&#x27;s body. Subsequent redesign of the SDS MOLLE led to the deletion of this feature and the vest (FLC) and ruck/frame became separate non-integral items.

== Design ==

The term MOLLE is technically only used to describe the specific system manufactured by Specialty Defense Systems, but is also casually used interchangeably to describe generically all load bearing systems and subsystems that utilize the woven PALS (Pouch Attachment Ladder System) webbing for modular pouch attachment (though PALS is proprietary to Natick Labs, most use MOLLE and PALS interchangeably). Derivatives based on the MOLLE attachment method (such as the Tactical Tailor MALICE clip system) have also been developed. Any system that utilizes modular attachment methods and is usable with U.S. general issue MOLLE components is often considered &quot;MOLLE-compatible&quot; or is called a &quot;MOLLE&quot; system. Increasingly, non-military manufacturers are incorporating PALS onto outdoor equipment.

There are three general modes of attachment in the MOLLE arena; the &quot;Natick Snap&quot;, which uses a polyethylene reinforced webbing strap with the &#x27;pushthedot&#x27; snap fastener for security; the polymer &quot;Malice&quot; clip, developed by Tactical Tailor as an alternative to the Natick Snap concept, which interweaves like the Natick Snap but terminates in a semi-permanent closure that requires a screwdriver or other flat-tipped object to disengage; and a variety of attachments that fall into the &quot;Weave &amp; Tuck&quot; category, in which the end of an interwoven strap is tucked into an item&#x27;s backing after attachment to a vest or pack (Paraclete&#x27;s SofStrap and Spec Ops Brand&#x27;s hybrid attachment).

The PALS grid consists of horizontal rows of webbing, spaced 25 mm apart, and attached to the backing at intervals.
The stitchings are spaced apart, with a range of usually considered acceptable in practice.

== Components ==

; Tactical assault panel: The Tactical Assault Panel (TAP) replaces the fighting load carrier (FLC). It is a bib-like chest rig that can be used alone or mounted on the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) or Soldier Plate Carrier System. The TAP is covered with PALS webbing and storage for up to eight rifle magazines (six 5.56 magazines + two 7.62 NATO magazines or eight 5.56 magazines).
; Assault pack: The Assault Pack is a backpack with 2000 cubic inches (32L) of storage space.
; Medium rucksack: The Medium Rucksack is an external frame rucksack with 3000 cubic inches (50L) of storage space. It is designed to be worn over body armor and supports loads up to 60 lbs. It features a large main compartment with internal dividers for items like the hydration system, 60mm mortar rounds, along with a harness for ASIP radios. Two smaller compartments are located outside the main compartment. The pack is adorned in PALS webbing.
; Large rucksack: The Large Rucksack is an external frame rucksack with 4000 cubic inches (65L) of storage space. It features a large main compartment with an internal divider between the upper and lower half for organizing loads. It is covered with PALS webbing, and ALICE webbing on the side to support legacy items such as the 2 quart canteen pouch. It is highly adjustable for comfort and load distribution.
; Hydration bladder: Plastic hydration bladder to supplement the and canteens for on-the-go hydration.
; Modular pouches: Pouches of various utility that can be attached wherever PALS webbing exists. One type is a &quot;sustainment pouch&quot;, which holds three MREs. The various MOLLE pouches are commonly used to carry ammunition, gas masks, batons, flares, grenades, canteens, handcuffs and pepper spray, and custom pouches include PALS-compatible pistol holders, hydration pouches and utility pouches. These pouches are normally secured through the use of straps, alice clips or speedclips.

<doc id="810940" wikidata="Q700300" url="?curid=810940" title="Louis of Nassau">
<text>Louis of Nassau (Dutch: Lodewijk van Nassau, January 10, 1538 – April 14, 1574) was the third son of William I, Count of Nassau-Siegen and Juliana of Stolberg, and the younger brother of Prince William of Orange Nassau.

Louis was a key figure in the revolt of the Netherlands against Spain and a strongly convinced Calvinist, unlike his brother William, whom he helped in various ways, including by arranging the marriage between him and his second wife Anna of Saxony. In 1569 William appointed him governor of the principality of Orange, giving him an indisputable position in French politics.

==The Compromise ==

In 1566 he was one of the leaders of the league of lesser nobles who signed the &quot;Compromis des Nobles&quot;. The Compromise was an open letter, in the form of a petition, to King Philip II of Spain stating that he should withdraw the Inquisition in the Netherlands. On April 5, 1566, with the following of two hundred horsemen, the Compromise was presented to the regent Margaret of Austria. During this audience one of her councilors, count Charles of Berlaymont, tried to calm her nerves with the words &quot;Quoi, Madame. Peur de ces gueux?&quot; &quot;What Madame, afraid of these beggars?&quot;. It was from this moment on that the opponents of King Philip&#x27;s policy proudly took the name Beggars (Les Gueux, Geuzen) as their own.

==Battle of Heiligerlee ==
With the coming of Alva, Louis and his brother William withdrew from the Netherlands. From outside they gathered an army and in 1568, with the help of French Huguenots, they were able to invade from three sides. Louis and his younger brother Adolf would enter the northern Netherlands through Friesland, Jean de Villers entered the southern provinces between the Rhine and the Meuse and the Huguenots would invade Artois.

The Army under Louis&#x27;s command would eventually be the only one to gain a victory. Jean de Villers and his troops were captured two days after they crossed the Meuse, while the Huguenots were attacked and defeated by French royal troops at St. Valery. Jean de Villers eventually betrayed the entire campaign and the sources of the war-treasury to his interrogators.

Louis entered Friesland on April 24, to which Alva responded by sending an army under the command of Jean de Ligne, Duke of Aremberg. The Spaniards had an inferior force, and Aremburg wanted to wait for reinforcements from the Count of Meghem, but he was late in coming and Aremberg&#x27;s men were mutinous and pressured him to offer battle. The two armies met at Heiligerlee on May 23, where Louis ambushed the Spanish troops. Louis won the army the Battle of Heiligerlee but his younger brother Adolf fell in the battle.

==Battle of Jemmingen ==

Although William wanted Louis to retreat to Delfzijl, Louis remained in Groningen, where he met the much smaller army led by Alva himself (2,000 Spaniards against 12,000 Protestants). Louis fell back towards Jemmingen where, on July 21, 1568, the battle raged for three hours until Alva&#x27;s army drove them over the bridges of the Ems and eventually into the Ems itself. Many drowned trying to cross the river; Louis stripped himself of his heavy armor and was able to swim across to safety. In the end the Dutch rebellion lost 7,000 men at the battle of Jemmingen.

==Mons ==
After Jemmingen, Louis re-joined his brother William and went back to France where they joined up with Huguenot leader Admiral Coligny. He fought in the battles at Jarnac and Moncontour. At the latter action, he was given command of the right wing of the Huguenot army and, after Coligny was wounded and left the field, he took control of the whole force. He was unable to prevent its defeat, but covered the retreat with his cavalry. Ultimately, he was able to improve their French connections as governor of the principality of Orange.

In 1572 Watergeuzen had captured the city of Brielle and claimed it for William. Soon most cities in Holland and Zeeland were in the hands of the rebels and William once again became stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland.

Louis quickly raised a small force in France, and entered Hainaut on May 23, capturing Mons. Suddenly Alva found himself held between two enemies with his own army rebellious and unpaid. William tried to relieve his brother at Mons but after an attempt on his life from which he barely managed to escape, he was unable to come to Louis&#x27;s aid. Alva was now able to bring the surrender of Mons on good terms and on September 19 Louis and his army left Mons with the honors of war. Diverting Alva&#x27;s attention to Mons had made it possible for the North to strengthen itself and although he may have regained Mons he had lost Holland, which was now strong enough to resist.

==Battle of Mookerheyde ==

In 1574 funds were running low and the Spanish were closing in on Middelburg and Leiden. Hoping for a diversion in the south, William wrote to Louis asking for help. That spring, Louis, along with his youngest Nassau brother Henry and the Elector Palatine’s son Christopher of Bavaria, crossed the Meuse with their army. They hoped to be a decent diversion but found themselves outmaneuvered by the Spanish troops under an experienced leader, Sancho d&#x27;Avila. Leading the charge on the Spanish Louis was shot in the arm. He carried on, pretending he was fine, but was losing blood so fast that his friends took him away from the battle. He was brought to a nearby hut, where he ordered his friends to save themselves. Louis was never seen again, neither alive nor dead. His brother Henry and Christopher of Bavaria were also lost in the Battle of Mookerheyde.

<doc id="810943" wikidata="Q107299045" url="?curid=810943" title="Resident Alien (album)">
<text>Resident Alien is the debut studio album by the English rock band Spacehog. Released by Sire Records and Elektra Records on 24 October 1995, the album was certified gold on 29 July 1996 and included the hit single &quot;In the Meantime&quot;, which reached the top of the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US, and remained there for four weeks. Most of &quot;Resident Alien&quot;″s basic tracks were recorded live in a barn in Woodstock, New York. It was intended to give the album the immediacy of live room recording.

Although Jonny Cragg makes his singing debut in &quot;Skylark&quot; on the band&#x27;s second LP, &quot;The Chinese Album&quot;, it is his voice that introduces &quot;Space Is the Place&quot; on &quot;Resident Alien&quot;. The spoken line in the middle of &quot;Never Coming Down (Part II)&quot;, &quot;Everybody in the world is bent&quot;, comes from the 1969 movie &quot;The Italian Job&quot;. The movie also features jail inmates clapping out the rhythm used in this song. In a tribute to the film &quot;Candyman&quot;, the chorus to &quot;Candyman&quot; repeats the titular name four times (also referencing the Sammy Davis Jr. standard, originally appearing in the 1971 film Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory).

&quot;Only a Few&quot; and &quot;In the Meantime&quot; were used in the 1996 film &quot;Libor Karas World Tour, The Bouncing Czech&quot;. &quot;In the Meantime&quot; was also used as the theme song for David Spade&#x27;s 1998 one-hour HBO stand-up comedy special &quot;David Spade: Take the Hit&quot;; was used in the film &quot;Fanboys&quot;; is a playable song in the video game &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot; as a re-recording, as the original recording featured in &quot;Rock Band 3&quot;; served as the theme song for the TV show &quot;Hindsight&quot;; and was featured in the film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;. &quot;Never Coming Down (Part II)&quot; was featured in the 1996 movie &quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Gazette&quot; wrote: &quot;While the band sets the crunch of &#x27;Cruel to Be Kind&#x27; (not Nick Lowe) against the bubble of &#x27;The Last Dictator&#x27;, singer Royston Langdon does Bowie as Bay City Roller.&quot;

<text>Gabija (also known as Gabieta, Gabeta) is the spirit of the fire in Lithuanian mythology. She is the protector of home and family. Her name is derived from &quot;gaubti&quot; (to cover, to protect) or from St. Agatha (, Gafiya). Gabija is only mentioned in a list of Lithuanian gods by the Christian theologian Jan Łasicki in his treatise on idolatry (published in 1615). She is found in Lithuanian folklore. 

Gabija could take zoomorphic forms of a cat, stork or rooster, or she could appear as a woman clothed in red. Gabija was greatly respected and cared for like a living creature. People would feed Gabija by offering bread and salt. Fire had to be laid to bed – women would cover the charcoal with ashes every evening so that fire would not wander around. Just as Gabija was the protector of the house, mother of the household was the protector of fire. Sometimes a bowl of clean water would be left near the hearth so that Gabija could wash herself. If angered, Gabija would &quot;go for a walk&quot; burning the house. Much folklore describes the ill fate of those who offended Gabija by stomping, spitting, or urinating on her.

Matka Gabia is the Lithuanian goddess of the home, hearth, and patron of their care. She most likely originates from Gabija.

In microbiology the name Gabija, shortened to Gaj, has been attributed to a genome.

<doc id="810954" wikidata="Q1530256" url="?curid=810954" title="Underemployment equilibrium">
<text>In Keynesian economics, underemployment equilibrium is a situation with a persistent shortfall relative to full employment and potential output so that unemployment is higher than at the NAIRU or the &quot;natural&quot; rate of unemployment.

==Theoretical framework==

===Origin===
The concept of underemployment equilibrium originates from analyzing underemployment in the context of General Equilibrium Theory, a branch of microeconomics. It describes a steady economic state when consumptions and production outputs are both suboptimal – many economic agents in the economy are producing less than what they could produce in some other equilibrium states.[1] Economic theory dictates that underemployment equilibrium possesses certain stability features under standard assumptions[2] – the “invisible hand” (market force) can not, by itself, alter the equilibrium outcome to a more socially desirable equilibrium.[3] Exogenous forces such as fiscal policy have to be implemented in order to drive the economy to a better state.

===Formal definition=== 
In an economy formula_1: every economic agent &quot;h&quot; has a utility function formula_2 and an initial endowment of wealth formula_3 every firm &quot;f&quot; has a production function formula_4 every agent’s share of firm &quot;f&quot; is formula_5 An underemployment equilibrium, given a price vector &quot;p&quot;, is defined as the consumption-production vector formula_6 such that [4]

:For every firm &quot;f&quot;, producing formula_7 maximizes its profit
:For every economic agent &quot;h&quot;, consuming formula_8 maximizes its utility 
:The market clears, meaning that the sum of optimal consumptions of all agents, formula_9 , equals to the sum of their initial endowments, formula_10 plus the sum of optimal profits for all firms, formula_11[1]

==Causes==
Given a well-defined economy[2][4], there could be many stable equilibrium states – some are more desirable than others from a social welfare point of view. Many factors contribute to the existence of undesirable equilibriums, among which two are crucial for underemployment equilibrium: oversupply and insufficient demand. When the labor force are overeducated for the skill level of available employment opportunities in the economy, an underemployment equilibrium will occur. Insufficient demand addresses the same issue at the macro level. When there are many fewer job opportunities than unemployed individuals, the unemployment rate is high. Moreover, well-qualified workers will face a tougher job market and thus have to settle for jobs originally meant for less skilled individuals. “Oversupply” here refers to an excess in both labor quantity and quality.

==Forms of underemployment equilibrium==

===Overqualification===
Overqualification is the most common form of underemployment equilibrium and is a direct result of oversupply. It defines the situation when individuals work in professions which require less education, skill, experience or ability than they possess. In economic terms, these agents are producing less than their socially optimal output. Collectively, when a lot of individuals produce below their full potential, the economy is in a sub-optimal underemployment equilibrium.[5]

===Overstaffing===
Overstaffing refers to the state when firms or other organizations that act as employers in an economy are hiring more people than they need. This is much less common than overqualification. This redundancy invalidates unemployment rates as a signal for the existence of underemployment equilibrium. When firms are overstaffed, they can not achieve their maximum profit levels, which leads to undesirable social consequences such as low GDP growth. Organizations plagued by overstaffing, including not-for-profit organizations, cannot achieve maximum efficiency and their ability to create value according to their mission, vision and purpose will be hampered.[6]

==Applications and historical examples==

===Underemployment during the Great Depression===
During the 1930s, Great Depression, U.S. unemployment rate reached 25% and GDP growth rate fell to −13%.[7] The U.S. economy at this period can be characterized by an underemployment equilibrium. On the one hand, many outside forces (including financial instability, hyper-inflation, lack of capital, etc.) created a negative shock to the demand of job market. On the other hand, the first two decades of the 20th century saw rapid advancement in production technologies, which effectively eliminated a large number of skilled jobs. Both of the above forces help create an insufficient demand of labor market during that time, causing an underemployment equilibrium. This particular underemployment equilibrium takes form of overqualification, characterized by high unemployment rate and low household incomes.

===Underemployment in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis===
Graduates entering the job market in 2012 faced very tough competitions[8], caused by an oversupply of skilled workers, including fresh graduates and people who were laid off during the 2008 financial crisis. Graduates did not have enough time to respond to the 2008 financial crisis and continued to finish their degrees, only to find that there are not enough jobs upon graduation. This underemployment equilibrium state is characterized by overqualification – many college graduates are taking positions designed for less educated individuals due to gloomy job market conditions.[8]

==Data==
The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates monthly the “Underemployment Rate” starting from January, 1948. The underemployment rate has a cyclical trend and is generally higher during recession periods. Similar to the unemployment rate, the underemployment rate varies for different subgroups of the labor force. For example, individuals with Ph.Ds enjoy low underemployment rate while individuals with high school diploma or lower usually suffer from a high underemployment rate.[9]

<text>Abatia (syn. &quot;Raleighia&quot; Gardner) is a genus of about ten species of Central and South American trees in the family Salicaceae (following the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification). Previously, it was treated in the family Flacourtiaceae, or tribe Abatieae of the family Passifloraceae (Lemke 1988) or Samydaceae by G. Bentham &amp; J.D. Hooker and Hutchinson.

Its native range stretches from Mexico to northern Argentina. It is also found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru.

&quot;Abatia&quot; has opposite leaves with very small stipules and marginal glands at the base of the blade of the leaf. The valvate (meeting at the edges without overlapping) perianth (sepal and petal together) members are closely joined at the base. They bear many processes.

The leaves of &quot;A. rugosa&quot; and &quot;A. parviflora&quot; are source of black dye in Peru.

The genus name of &quot;Abatia&quot; is in honour of Pedro Abad y Mestre (1747–1800), a Spanish apothecary and professor of botany in Seville, Spain. 
It was first described and published in Fl. Peruv. Prodr. Vol.78 on table 14 in 1794.

<text>Melinda H. &quot;Mindy&quot; Cohn (born May 20, 1966) is an American actress. She starred as Natalie Green in the sitcom &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; from 1979 to 1988, and is known for voicing Velma Dinkley in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise from 2002 to 2015, succeeding B. J. Ward, before being succeeded herself by Kate Micucci. Cohn appeared on VH1&#x27;s List of &quot;100 Greatest Kid Stars&quot;.

==Early life==
Cohn was born in Los Angeles and was raised Jewish.

== Career ==
Cohn was discovered by actress Charlotte Rae when Rae and the producers of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; visited Westlake School in Holmby Hills, California, while doing research for the show; she had been asked by the principal to be a student tour guide for the group, who found themselves enchanted by her natural comic instincts as she led them around the campus. Cohn was cast as Natalie Green and portrayed the character for the series&#x27; nine-year run (1979–1988), as well as in the reunion movie (2001). In 2013, she commented on Charlotte Rae&#x27;s lobbying on her behalf: &quot;Mr. Reynolds calls me into his office. It seemed that Charlotte Rae had fallen madly in love with me, in part because I reminded her of her best childhood friend Natalie—and I was irrepressible, charming, and hilarious. So she asked the producers to create a part for me in the show. Honestly, the whole thing seemed so fantastic I didn’t know what to think.&quot; After the show, she remained friends with Rae. Two months before her acting mentor&#x27;s 90th birthday in 2016, when Cohn was unavailable to attend &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; reunion interview, she sent Rae a video message praising her decades-long friend for teaching her the craft of acting. Cohn said that one of the reasons she did &quot;The Facts of Life Reunion&quot; in 2001 was that the actresses in the long-running 1980s series have been wrongly denied a cut of the syndication and DVD profits from the series. &quot;We all never got paid and still don&#x27;t get paid for DVDs and reruns... we felt we were owed.&quot;

Cohn has continued her acting career outside of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. In 1984 she had a leading role as the daughter alongside Stockard Channing in RKO&#x27;s video production of &quot;Table Settings&quot;. In 1986, she appeared in &quot;The Boy Who Could Fly&quot; as next-door neighbor Geneva. She also had guest appearances in other popular TV shows, including &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; (playing Buddy&#x27;s sister Bunny, a young alcoholic, in the 1988 episode &quot;Bottle Baby&quot;), and two guest appearances in the second season of the cop drama &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (playing Rosa in the 1987 episode &quot;Christmas In Saigon&quot; and the 1988 episode &quot;Chapel of Love&quot;). In 2004 Cohn appeared in the WB comedy &quot;The Help&quot;. In 2010, Cohn played the role of Violet, the leading character in Casper Andreas&#x27;s movie &quot;Violet Tendencies,&quot; and appeared on the Season 8 premiere of TLC&#x27;s &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; on October 29, 2010. She appeared in an episode of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; on July 13, 2011, on &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot; on March 26, 2012, in Judson Theatre Company&#x27;s &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; in 2013, and in &quot;The Middle&quot; on May 21, 2014. Cohn reprised her Velma Dinkley role in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mindy Cohn is a breast cancer survivor, having been diagnosed with it in 2012 and was declared cancer-free in 2017. Cohn is a strong supporter of the LGBT community and has stated that she is proud to be a &quot;fag hag&quot;. She has a degree in cultural anthropology from Loyola Marymount University and is a founding member of the weSpark cancer support center.

In 2003 Cohn was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for her work on the TV show &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot;, for which she provided the voice of Velma Dinkley. She reprised her role of Velma on &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; and in several other &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; movies.

Cohn received a positive notice from &quot;Variety&quot; for her role in the 2007 Daniel Waters comedy film &quot;Sex and Death 101&quot;. In 2023, she received an Indie Series Award for her voice acting roles in season 2 of &quot;Around the Sun&quot;.

<doc id="810968" wikidata="Q7722551" url="?curid=810968" title="The Chinese Album">
<text>The Chinese Album is the second album from the expatriate British alternative rock band Spacehog. It was released on Sire Records in 1998.

&quot;The Chinese Album&quot; was considered for a soundtrack and basis of a film called &quot;Mungo City&quot; (later called &quot;The Chinese Movie&quot;). It was to be about a band that moves to Hong Kong for success after being rejected by a New York record company. Unsatisfied with the final script, Spacehog dismissed any plans for shooting.

Spacehog wrote and recorded 20 songs for &quot;The Chinese Album&quot;. Among these are the B-sides &quot;Final Frontier&quot;, &quot;Isle of Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Cryogenic Lover&quot;, which were released on European singles.

&quot;Carry On&quot; peaked at No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;for the most part, &quot;The Chinese Album&quot; sounds like &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; or Roxy Music&#x27;s early material, stripped of any sense of commitment or adventure.&quot; The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; wrote that &quot;one can only admire a group so unrepentantly unfashionable, especially when it stirs its influences together with such flair and flamboyance.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; called the album &quot;a pretty, precious confection of pop ditties.&quot; &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; deemed it &quot;a beautifully crafted masterpiece, intelligent, edgy and eclectic.&quot;

<doc id="810993" wikidata="Q7945289" url="?curid=810993" title="Bill Kardash">
<text>William Arthur Kardash (June 10, 1912 – January 17, 1997) was a politician and member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1941 until 1958. He served as Winnipeg MLA from 1941 to 1958, as Worker&#x27;s Candidate at first, then as a representative of the Labor-Progressive Party. He was among the handful of Communists elected in Winnipeg between 1927 and 1983.

The youngest child of Ukrainian Canadian parents Danylo Kardash and Ulyta Byck, he was born in Hafford, Saskatchewan, north of Saskatoon, and educated at Hafford High School.

Kardash was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, having fought with the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion, in which he lost a leg. He was a member of the Communist Party of Canada and, after 1943, the Labor-Progressive Party, which was the legal front of the Communist Party after it was banned. Kardash became the first leader of the Manitoba LPP in 1943, retaining the position until 1948 when he resigned for health reasons. He was also the first national chairman of the LPP.

In 1940, Kardash married Mary Kostaniuk, with whom he had two children, Ted and Nancy.

In 1941, he was elected to the provincial legislature in the ten-member district of Winnipeg. He was re-elected in 1945. In 1949 and 1953, he was reelected in the new four-member district of Winnipeg North.

The LPP&#x27;s popularity declined after 1945. Kardash was the only candidate to run for the LPP in the Manitoba elections of 1953 and 1958.

Kardash was defeated in the 1958 general election. His defeat was due in part to the pressures of the Cold War, as well as the abolition of proportional representation and multi-member districts. This caused him to contest a single-member election held under first-past-the-post voting: he contested Burrows and came second to Co-operative Commonwealth Federation candidate John Hawryluk (socialism as practised by the CCF and its successor, the New Democratic Party, was popularly considered more moderate). After his defeat, the LPP would never again elect a candidate to the legislature.

In 1948, Kardash became general manager of the People&#x27;s Co-operative Dairy, Fuel and Lumber Yards in 1948, retiring in 1982. He served as president of the board of directors for the co-operative until the business was sold to its employees in 1993.

Kardash ran in the new Point Douglas constituency in 1969 for the (renamed) Communist Party of Manitoba, but received only 421 votes (9.81%), coming in last in a four-candidate race won by Donald Malinowski of the NDP.

Kardash remained active in Winnipeg&#x27;s Ukrainian community for the rest of his life.

Bill&#x27;s wife, Mary, was also a longtime communist activist and school trustee in Winnipeg.

In 1995, he attended a public dedication ceremony at the Ontario legislature held to honour veterans of the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion, of which he was one.

After Kardash&#x27;s death in 1997, the Manitoba legislature held a moment of silence in his honour.

<doc id="810999" wikidata="Q7739923" url="?curid=810999" title="The Hogyssey">
<text>The Hogyssey is the third album from rock band Spacehog.

The album was released on compact disc by Artemis Records on 10 April 2001. The title track is a rock arrangement of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;, similar to Eumir Deodato&#x27;s &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)&quot;. The album was recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee.

&quot;The Hogyssey&quot; went through several name changes. The original name was &quot;This Is America&quot; and later named &quot;2001: A Space Hogyssey&quot; after the title track. Then, after a lawsuit threat, the album was renamed again as &quot;The Hogyssey&quot;.

==Critical reception==

John Duffy of AllMusic commended the attempt to recapture the &quot;Resident Alien&quot; sound through impactful and inspired riffs but was critical of the band copying themselves and their &quot;Zarathustra&quot; reworking being &quot;downright ill-advised&quot;, concluding that: &quot;Crunchy guitars aside, perhaps &quot;Hogyssey&quot; is a misstep for Langdon and company.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Devon Powers also noted the band&#x27;s return to the intergalactic soundscape of their first record but felt it was outdated, calling it competently made but unconvincing, despite the tracks emitting a charm and wit to them from even the weaker cuts, saying &quot;they spend too little time taking alternative rock – which, arguably, they&#x27;re one of the few purveyors of these days – to a place where it&#x27;s doing something new.&quot; Mac Randall of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt the band&#x27;s penchant for loud and catchy melodies had diminished when songs like &quot;This Is America&quot; and the title track &quot;go beyond camp into the realm of the truly embarrassing&quot;, but highlighted &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Moon&quot;, &quot;Perpetual Drag&quot; and &quot;At Least I Got Laid&quot; for being able to &quot;justify the bombast with irresistible choruses, indicating that given the right material, the &#x27;Hog can still snort with the best of &#x27;em.&quot;

==Track listing==
;Notes
* The song &quot;The Horror&quot; ends at 4:47. After 11 minutes of silence (4:47–15:47), begins the hidden track &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hear You&quot;.

<doc id="811013" wikidata="Q7987058" url="?curid=811013" title="West gallery music">
<text>West gallery music, also known as Georgian psalmody, refers to the sacred music (metrical psalms, with a few hymns and anthems) sung and played in Church of England parish churches, as well as nonconformist chapels, from 1700 to around 1850. In the late 1980s, west gallery music experienced a revival and is now sung by several west gallery &quot;quires&quot; (choirs).

The term &quot;west gallery&quot; derives from the wooden galleries which in the 18th century were constructed at the west end of typical churches, and from which gallery the choir would perform. Churches were built in a standard layouts, with the nave running from east-west away from the altar, so that the west gallery or choir, would face the altar, the same way as, but above, the church-goers. Victorians disapproved of the Georgian galleries, and most were removed during restorations in the 19th century.

== History ==

By the 1700s, many church goers were unsatisfied by the state of congregational singing, which resulted in the formation of amateur choirs, which were initially male. In rural English churches, congregations often lacked an organ, but still needed support in order to maintain pitch in complex music. From the mid 1700s, we see this initially practice by the presence of an accompanying bass instrument and later a small band that was flexible on instrumentation but most commonly consisted of flutes, clarinets, bassoons, cellos, and violins. Originally, instrumentalists would double the vocal parts, but later, more complex music was added with specific instrumentation, such as small symphonies.

The repertory consisted mainly of metrical psalms and anthems, and fuguing tunes were particularly common in the mid-18th century. Many teachers, such as Michael Beesly and William Tans&#x27;ur sold their own psalmody, and borrowed freely from each other. In addition, many musicians made their own manuscript compilations due to the prohibitive cost of printed books. Most of these composers were also amateurs and often learned from other psalmodists, although, some may have been conventionally trained. This lack of training resulted in peculiar compositions, and early repertoire was based on linear composition from the Renaissance, often using open fifths and false relations. Some additional characteristics of this music include unexpected dissonances, consecutive fifths and octaves, great originality, intensive word painting, strong melodic lines, and the prevalence of the tenor voice, often doubled an octave higher by treble voices. Gallery music was viewed as a financially viable genre by many professional composers, such as John Alcock (elder and younger), Capel Bond, William Hayes the elder and Samuel Webbe the elder, who all published psalmody books.

English country psalmody was exported to America around the mid 18th century, where it inspired the creation of many new compositions by members of the First New England School. Some of these works have remained in use in shape note traditions, for example in the Sacred Harp repertoire. The 4-part, tenor-led harmony, fuguing tunes and anthems and other aspects strongly helped influence the shape note musical tradition, and in many ways the American music style is directly evolved from the older one.

Use of west gallery music in the Church dwindled in part due to the rise of urbanization and also due to the desire for more polite, more formal style of worship. This more formal style of worship culminated in the Oxford movement, and eventually the &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; (1861). Furthermore, the old church bands were often difficult for a vicar to control, while influence over an organist was a much easier task. Such an ousting of the band by an organist is given a fictional treatment in Thomas Hardy’s early novel &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot;, which reflected actual events at Hardy’s church at Stinsford. Another possible reason for this, is that when the Methodists split from the Anglican church, many of these bands would have been split apart, or even leaving en masse.

In 1893, the Reverend Francis William Galpin described the church band at Winterbourne Abbas, which he believed was the last surviving example in England; however two years later, a survey of parishes in Cornwall found that 18 out of 219 churches still had a band.

<text>Ian McCaskill (born John Robertson McCaskill; 28 July 1938 – 10 December 2016) was a Scottish weather forecaster who frequently appeared on the BBC.

==Early life==
McCaskill attended Queen&#x27;s Park Secondary in Glasgow, and then the University of Glasgow, where he studied geology and chemistry.

==Career==
McCaskill joined the RAF in 1959 as part of his National Service and became an airman meteorologist, first in Scotland and then in Cyprus. He once joked that when he joined the RAF he was given a choice between Catering and Meteorology, he did not know what meteorology was but he knew he could not cook. He left the RAF in 1961 and joined the Met Office, working at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Malta and Manchester.

In 1978, McCaskill began working at the BBC Weather Centre, and presented the weather forecast for the BBC on both television and radio. He retired on 31 July 1998.

McCaskill was known for his soft-spoken demeanor, and his presentation style was widely imitated, including by the satirical comedy show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and by impersonator Rory Bremner. He was one of the weathermen mentioned on the novelty song &quot;John Kettley Is a Weatherman&quot;.

McCaskill worked as a motivational speaker, and appeared on the BBC Television shows &quot;MasterChef&quot; and on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, as well as in a number of TV advertisements. He also participated in the first series of Celebrity Fit Club in 2002.

In 2006, he co-wrote the book &quot;Frozen in Time&quot;, about Britain&#x27;s worst ever winters, with Paul Hudson.

==Personal life and death==
McCaskill lived at Seer Green, near Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire. He had two daughters with his first wife Lesley Charlesworth, to whom he was married from 1959 until her death from breast cancer in 1992. In 1998, he married Pat Cromack, becoming stepfather to her two sons.

McCaskill was a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society. In May 2000, he opened the first phase of the £1.2 million Lower Leas Coastal Park in Folkestone.

McCaskill was diagnosed with dementia in 2011 and died, in a nursing home in Leeds, on 10 December 2016, aged 78.

<text>Berkeley Cars Ltd was a British car manufacturer based in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire. The company produced economical sporting microcars with motorcycle-derived engines from 322 cc to 692 cc and front wheel drive between 1956 and 1960. About 4,100 cars had been sold before bankruptcy in 1960.

==History==
The Berkeley automobile was a collaboration between designer Lawrence &quot;Lawrie&quot; Bond and the Berkeley Coachworks factory owned by Charles Panter, which at the time was one of the largest manufacturers of caravans in Europe. It was an ideal project for Berkeley, who had developed considerable skills in the use of Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), and were looking for something to fill the gaps in the very seasonal caravan market. What Panter and Bond wanted to achieve was &quot;something good enough to win World 750cc races... but cheap, safe, easily repairable and pretty.&quot;

The early cars were an immediate success on the home market, and several derivative models were spawned over the four years of car production. Export markets, most notably the United States, were exploited and the cars earned a reputation for fun, if fragile, sports motoring on a budget. Recognising the threat posed by the newly introduced Mini and Austin-Healey Sprite in the late fifties, the company started to develop a more conventional model with the support of Ford Motor Company.

The caravan market collapsed towards the end of 1960, and Berkeley&#x27;s cash flow problems forced the company into liquidation on 12 December 1960, taking its car manufacturing activities with it. After having produced about 4100 cars of various types, the workforce was laid off shortly before Christmas that year. An attempted sale of the company to Sharp&#x27;s Commercials Ltd (manufacturer of the Bond Minicar) came to nothing, and the company&#x27;s assets were liquidated in 1961.

The factory was later used by Kayser Bondor Ltd to make women&#x27;s underwear, but it was demolished in 2002 and the site turned over to housing. A road named &#x27;Berkeley Close&#x27; in the housing estate provides the only obvious link to the car factory.

Today there is an owner&#x27;s club (the Berkeley Enthusiasts&#x27; Club), which provides a range of parts and services aimed at preserving the remaining few hundred cars known to survive worldwide.

==Models==

===Sports (SA322)===
Berkeley&#x27;s first production car was the &#x27;Sports&#x27; (type SA322), announced in September 1956 and produced from October 1956 to January 1957. Production began with two prototypes (registered RMJ395 and RMJ946), which were seen being tested around the neighbourhood of Biggleswade in the late summer of 1956. Stirling Moss drove one at Goodwood in September, and the car was launched to the public at the 1956 London Motor Show – one year ahead of the Lotus Elite, which was also to be of fibreglass monocoque construction.

Bond&#x27;s 2-seater open tourer design capitalised on Berkeley&#x27;s GRP experience, and consisted of three large mouldings (floor or &#x27;punt&#x27;, nose, tail) with no conventional chassis. The front edges to the doors slanted forward so that when the doors were opened they hinged upwards and then closed by themselves. Although usually configured as a two-seater with a bench seat, a hatch could be removed from behind the front seat, revealing a compartment normally containing the spare wheel and some luggage space which could double as a basic seat for a small child. Equipment was basic, the fuel gauge was an optional extra.

Power was provided by a British Anzani twin-cylinder 322 cc two-stroke engine producing and mounted transversely, driving the front wheels via a chain and three-speed gearbox. The engine was already used by various motorcycle manufacturers such as Cotton and Greeves, but in the Berkeley was fitted with a Siba Dynastart to provide both battery charging and electric starting. It was an advanced two-stroke engine which incorporated a rotary inlet valve mechanism in the centre of the crankshaft. The gearbox was a three-speed Albion HJR5, using a steering column-mounted gearchange.

The car had all-round independent suspension by coil springs and in spite of the small engine gave remarkably good performance owing to its light weight (kerb weight is ) and excellent roadholding. Girling hydraulic brakes with drums were used.

The identification plate was a plain stamped alloy rectangle fitted on the engine bay side wall just above the Dynastart and marked SA322 B1 etc. (Sports Anzani 322 cc Berkeley Chassis number 1).

===Sports (SE328)===


After 163 of the SA322 cars had been manufactured, a change was made to the SE328 model with a 328 cc Excelsior engine offering . The production run ran from Jan 1957 to April 1958 with chassis numbers from 164 to 1422, many being exported to the United States where it sold for approximately $1600 (equivalent to $ today). The manufacture touted the number 70, meaning it could reach and had an average fuel economy of 70 mpg. The export model was differentiated by having separate headlamps whereas on the home market they were faired into the wings, although the export type lamps could be specified.

Early cars from Jan 1957 to about chassis number 476 in June 1957 still used a column gear change. During their production run a Deluxe model was offered which was bodily the same but featured polished wheel trims and spinners, tachometer and twin carburettors. The chassis plate was similar to the Anzani type on the early cars but was later changed to a printed type fitted to the bulkhead above the brake master cylinder. The printed type chassis plate had type ‘SE328’ printed on it. Most of these cars were supplied with a three-speed gearbox similar to the Anzani except for the mounting flanges. All of the cars had the sloping leading edges to the doors.

Motor magazine tested a 328 cc Berkeley in 1957 and found it to have a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 30.6 seconds. Fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £574 on the home market including taxes of £152 (equivalent to £ today).

The SE328 enjoyed considerable success and press exposure through their involvement with lightweight motor racing, and their famous drivers included Pat Moss who drove one in the 1958 Liège-Brescia-Liège rally for cars up to 500 cc. The Berkeley team – a works-supported entry of six cars including BBC commentator Robin Richards – led as far as Slovenia, but slow climbing in summer heat found their weakness and Moss ended up being towed back to Italy by another Berkeley. None of the Berkeleys finished the event.

===Sports and Twosome (SE492)===
In late 1957 a new derivative model was introduced, using a , Excelsior three-cylinder 492 cc engine with triple carburettors. This engine configuration was made possible by the vertically split crankcase of the Excelsior engine and modular crankshaft and barrels, which made adding a central cylinder relatively easy. A four speed gearbox was standardised. The top speed was now . Production ran from October 1957 to March 1959 with chassis numbered 1 to 666. From about October 1958, in order to coincide with the introduction of the &#x27;Foursome&#x27; (see below), they were renamed the ‘Twosome’. Also at the 1958 Motor Show a Fixed Head (or Hardtop) was announced and displayed that had external as well as the usual internal door handles, but there are no records that this body style actually reached production.

It is probable that cars pre chassis number 120 (approx), about April 1958, had similar bodies to the early Berkeley “Sports” cars. Cars from about April 1958 to the end of production had vertical front door edges and internal door hinges, as well as body moulding and a few mechanical changes. Early cars were fitted with the four speed TR gearbox whilst later cars had the larger and stronger VR gearbox.

The cars enjoyed some success in Motor Sport and Giovanni Lurani bought three which he took to Italy, fitted them with his own design of hardtop, and running them in the 750 cc GT class, one driven by Lorenzo Bandini finishing first in the 1958 Monza 12 hour race.

Reliability of the air-cooled two-strokes, became more of an issue with the extra heat generated by the triple, and there were a number of recorded reports of warranty claims. 

===Foursome===

Announced in October 1958, this model was wider and longer than its forebears and differed structurally in that the rear swinging arms were lower and external to the body, and the spare wheel was mounted at the rear of the car. The type reference is supposed to be SE492/4 but one has the reference B.100. The chassis numbers are D1/1 to D1/19 but then again one example has D1/100, this particular car could be the prototype since it appears in publicity pictures.

The list price of the Foursome was £700 including Purchase Tax, with an additional £28 for the optional hardtop (equivalent to £ and £ today).

===B95 and B105===

The B95 and B105 models were launched at the 1959 Geneva Motor Show and boasted more power from twin-cylinder Royal Enfield 692 cc four-stroke engines, with the Super Meteor engine in the B95 and the Constellation unit in the B105 which could reputedly exceed mark. The engines featured Berkeley-design primary chain cases to accommodate a Lucas Bendix starter motor, an external Lucas dynamo mounted above the gearbox, and a duplex (or double-row) chain drive to the differential. Kerb weight increased to . B95 engine numbers have the unique prefix &#x27;SMTB&#x27;, while B105 engines are prefixed &#x27;SMUA&#x27;.

The prototype car was SE492 chassis number 638, which was modified to add bracing to withstand the extra power and weight of the four-stroke engine, a taller bonnet (US hood) with large grille to accommodate the engine, and unfaired headlights. In mid-February 1959 this car spent two weeks at the Royal Enfield factory, during which time it covered of general road use and of endurance testing at MIRA.

By the time of the press release announcing the launch of the B95 in March 1959, a further of road and track tests had also been carried out by Berkeley factory drivers. Perhaps to address the reputation for breaking down that the two-strokes had developed, especially in export markets, it was emphasised by the factory that during this testing there had been no involuntary stops or any form of mechanical failure, and that further testing would be performed until a total of had been completed.

At its launch, the B95 cost £659 (equivalent to £ today). Chassis numbers followed on from the SE492 series, and chassis number 670 (the earliest known B95) was registered at the end of March 1959. The first B105, chassis number 686, was delivered about one month later. Series production continued to chassis number 835. A separate batch of about 12 cars (chassis numbers 850 to 861) appear to have been made for Mantles Garage in the summer of 1960, which used some chassis parts and the bucket seats of the T60.

About 178 B95 and B105 models were made in total, of which approximately 15 to 20 cars were sold to export markets.
===QB95 and QB105===

In October 1959 the Q range was announced, with longer and wider bodies the same dimensions as the Foursome. The wheelbase went up from to and the track from to . The Qs were four seaters (just), although the QB version dispensed with the rear seat to give extra luggage space. The only &#x27;official&#x27; mention comes from the &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine&#x27;s Motor Show edition of October 1959, when it appears that Berkeley&#x27;s stand featured a red soft-top QB95 and a blue QB105 with a black hard-top. From this single reference it is assumed that Berkeley built at least two models of this series, although none are thought to have survived.

===T60===

Surprisingly late-on in the British microcar boom of the 1950s, Berkeley&#x27;s only three-wheeler model was not introduced until September 1959. It was an instant success in the UK where three-wheelers could legally be driven on a motorcycle licence, so were suitable for a motorcyclist with family. Another advantage was that the purchase and road tax fees for three-wheelers cost considerably less than four-wheeled vehicles. Thus at its launch, the T60 only cost £400 (equivalent to £ today).

They were fitted with the 328 cc Excelsior Talisman engine like the older SE328, and the four speed and reverse type VR gearbox, and were available as both soft and hardtops. The chassis plate, mounted on the bulkhead above the brake master cylinder, was the printed SE328 type but with &#x27;T60&#x27; stamped in the chassis number block along with the chassis number. Chassis numbers run from 1 to approximately 1800. The first 600 cars (approximately) had a bench seat with an umbrella-type pull handbrake and aluminium reinforcement sections in the punt body section. Cars thereafter had steel punt chassis sections, bucket seats and a floor-mounted handbrake lever.

In their road test of October 1959, &quot;The Motor Cycle&quot; magazine described the car as &quot;a fascinating, front-wheel-drive sports car which combines economy with liveliness and superb cornering.&quot;

Drive was still to the front wheels through a four-speed gearbox, but a trailing arm replaced the swing axle independent suspension of the four-wheeled cars. The very last cars had a revised ‘unit’ front and rear suspension layout, presumably to stop the bridge over the differential from breaking and the rear damper top mount detaching itself from the car.

===T60/4===
The T60/4 was produced from October 1960 and are mechanically and outwardly similar to the late T60. It was the same length and width as the standard T60, but differed in having extra room in the back for two seats, the additional space being created by a revised rear body moulding, thus creating proper seats in the back for two children. The rear bench seat was fastened to the car and the centre backrest had a bulge in it because of the revised rear wheel arch. The Car was available in both soft-top and hardtop forms. These cars used the revised front and rear suspension layouts used on the very late T60s.

The T60/4 had its own series of chassis numbers, prefixed &quot;T60.4&quot; and followed by a serial number. About 50 were made.

Both variants of T60 were in production at the time the company was declared insolvent in December 1960.
===B65===
The B65 was announced in September 1960 to complement the T60, B95 and B105. They were bodily the same as late SE492, complete with the lower front right hand side bulge in the punt to accommodate the larger 492 cc engine, but were fitted with the 328 cc Excelsior engine.
Although logically these cars should have run from chassis number 1422 to 1520, it seems more likely that chassis numbers ranged from 1500 to 1520. Very few of these cars are known to exist and the ones that do seem to suggest a production run of about 20 cars or fewer. The type reference marked on the chassis plate is B65.
===Bandit===

For 1961, the intention was to move into the mainstream sports car market with the Bandit designed by John Tojeiro. This was to be powered by the 997 cc Ford engine (as in the 105E Anglia) with Berkeley-designed MacPherson strut front and independent rear suspension. The car had a complex sheet steel chassis, braced by a GRP floor which was riveted to it, and boasted 8in diameter Girling disc brakes at the front. This made the design more conventional than earlier models, but still retaining a distinctive design and relatively light weight.

The cost of the development programme exacerbated the financial difficulties facing the company at the end of 1960, and despite active involvement in the project from Ford the Bandit failed to survive Berkeley&#x27;s insolvency. Only two prototypes were produced; the original Motor Show and press car registration number 700CNM, which has since been restored, and a second prototype car registered YRX292, which had a 1340 cc Ford Classic engine. This car was sold in Dursley in 1966 and was last seen in Swindon in the late 1960s.

The car was to have sold for £798, equivalent to about £ today, which would have made it more expensive than the Mini and Austin-Healey Sprite.

==Replicas==
In the 1980s a new company was formed in Syston, Leicestershire, to restore Berkeley cars. By 1991 it was using the original moulds to make new body panels and in 1993 complete T60 cars were being made with a new ladder type chassis. A choice of engines was available, including Mini, Citroen 2CV and motorcycle units.

In the late 1980s, in Auckland, New Zealand, a few cars called the &#x27;Ibis Berkeley&#x27; were made that paid homage to the Berkeley—but using Mini front and rear subframes and a fibreglass monocoque 6 inches wider. Sold as complete body units to accept Mini parts by Ian Byrd and Tim Monck-Mason, these were advanced little cars using carbon fibre and foam beams. This later became the WASP, looking more like a scaled down Cobra. 

==Resumption as Berkeley Coachworks==
In 2020, automotive designer Martin Rees partnered with motorsport engineer Simon Scleater with the intention of producing a modern interpretation of the Berkeley Bandit. Powered by a 2.3 litre Ford Ecoboost engine, the car would be based on a composite chassis using plant fibre materials. Production was set to commence in 2021 at the Old Warden Aerodrome in Biggleswade. Sixty examples of both a GT and Roadster version were planned to be produced, priced at around £40,000-£60,000. 

In August 2021, Berkeley Coachworks announced that due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, production of the Bandit had been severely disrupted due to significant supply chain issues. As of 2023, any further news of this venture has yet to materialise.

<doc id="811030" wikidata="Q1269302" url="?curid=811030" title="Schwinger–Dyson equation">
<text>The Schwinger–Dyson equations (SDEs) or Dyson–Schwinger equations, named after Julian Schwinger and Freeman Dyson, are general relations between correlation functions in quantum field theories (QFTs). They are also referred to as the Euler–Lagrange equations of quantum field theories, since they are the equations of motion corresponding to the Green&#x27;s function. They form a set of infinitely many functional differential equations, all coupled to each other, sometimes referred to as the infinite tower of SDEs.

In his paper &quot;The S-Matrix in Quantum electrodynamics&quot;, Dyson derived relations between different S-matrix elements, or more specific &quot;one-particle Green&#x27;s functions&quot;, in quantum electrodynamics, by summing up infinitely many Feynman diagrams, thus working in a perturbative approach. Starting from his variational principle, Schwinger derived a set of equations for Green&#x27;s functions non-perturbatively, which generalize Dyson&#x27;s equations to the Schwinger–Dyson equations for the Green functions of quantum field theories. Today they provide a non-perturbative approach to quantum field theories and applications can be found in many fields of theoretical physics, such as solid-state physics and elementary particle physics.

Schwinger also derived an equation for the two-particle irreducible Green functions, which is nowadays referred to as the inhomogeneous Bethe–Salpeter equation.

== Derivation ==
Given a polynomially bounded functional formula_1 over the field configurations, then, for any state vector (which is a solution of the QFT), formula_2, we have

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the action functional and formula_5 is the time ordering operation.

Equivalently, in the density state formulation, for any (valid) density state formula_6, we have

:formula_7

This infinite set of equations can be used to solve for the correlation functions nonperturbatively.

To make the connection to diagrammatic techniques (like Feynman diagrams) clearer, it is often convenient to split the action formula_4 as

:formula_9

where the first term is the quadratic part and formula_10 is an invertible symmetric (antisymmetric for fermions) covariant tensor of rank two in the deWitt notation whose inverse, formula_11 is called the bare propagator and formula_12 is the &quot;interaction action&quot;. Then, we can rewrite the SD equations as

:formula_13

If formula_1 is a functional of formula_15, then for an operator formula_16, formula_17 is defined to be the operator which substitutes formula_16 for formula_15. For example, if

:formula_20

and formula_21 is a functional of formula_22, then

:formula_23

If we have an &quot;analytic&quot; (a function that is locally given by a convergent power series) functional formula_24 (called the generating functional) of formula_22 (called the source field) satisfying

:formula_26

then, from the properties of the functional integrals

:formula_27

the Schwinger–Dyson equation for the generating functional is

:formula_28

If we expand this equation as a Taylor series about formula_29, we get the entire set of Schwinger–Dyson equations.

==An example: &quot;φ&quot;4==
To give an example, suppose

:formula_30

for a real field &quot;φ&quot;.

Then,

:formula_31

The Schwinger–Dyson equation for this particular example is:

:formula_32

Note that since

:formula_33

is not well-defined because

:formula_34

is a distribution in

:formula_35, formula_36 and formula_37,

this equation needs to be regularized.

In this example, the bare propagator D is the Green&#x27;s function for formula_38 and so, the Schwinger–Dyson set of equations goes as

: formula_39

and

: formula_40

etc.

(Unless there is spontaneous symmetry breaking, the odd correlation functions vanish.)

<text>Cyrus Smith (named Cyrus Harding in some English translations) is one of the protagonists of Jules Verne&#x27;s 1875 novel &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. He is an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He is a very skilled man and a fine literary example of a 19th-century engineer.

Cyrus Smith is also a man possessed of the kind of high moral qualities common in Verne&#x27;s protagonists. He is selfless, noble, honest, courageous, and utterly devoted to his companions. His practical knowledge of physics, chemistry, botany, navigation, and many other fields enables the Mysterious Island&#x27;s colonists to quickly establish a thriving mini-civilization in isolation from the rest of the world. Smith is, however, annoyed and secretive regarding the fact that the colony has been mysteriously saved many times by a benefactor who refuses to reveal himself, causing his own achievements to seem less significant.

In the 2002 novel &quot;Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius&quot; by Kevin J. Anderson, he is one of the officials captured by Robur (another Verne creation, from the novels &quot;Robur the Conqueror&quot; and &quot;Master of the World&quot;) during the Crimean War, along with Captain Nemo and Passepartout.

<doc id="811041" wikidata="Q540407" url="?curid=811041" title="Jean Hyppolite">
<text>Jean Hyppolite (; 8 January 1907 – 26 October 1968) was a French philosopher known for championing the work of G. W. F. Hegel, and other German philosophers, and educating some of France&#x27;s most prominent post-war thinkers. His major works include &quot;Genèse et structure de la Phénoménologie de l&#x27;esprit de Hegel&quot; (1946) and &quot;Études sur Marx et Hegel&quot; (1955) and the first translation of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; into French in 1939.

==Life and career==
Hyppolite was born in Jonzac. He was a graduate of the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) at roughly the same time as Jean-Paul Sartre. After graduation he embarked on a serious study of Hegel, teaching himself German in order to read &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; in the original. In 1939 he came out with his own translation and his commentary would later form the basis of the book &quot;Genesis and Structure of the Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; (published in 1947). After the Second World War, Hyppolite became a professor at the University of Strasbourg, before moving to the Sorbonne in 1949.

In 1952, Hyppolite published &quot;Logique et existence&quot;, a work that may have had a seminal effect on what was to become known as post-structuralism. This book tries to correlate Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology&quot; to his &quot;Logics&quot; (longer and shorter). In doing so, it raises the questions of language, being, and difference that were to become the hallmarks of new French philosophy at the end of the 20th century. The book was reviewed by the philosopher Gilles Deleuze. The translators of the English language edition of the text (SUNY Press, 1997) included Deleuze&#x27;s review at the end of the volume. 

In 1953 he founded the philosophical &quot;Épiméthée&quot; collection within the PUF publishing house. 

In 1954, he became the director of the ENS and in 1955 produced a study of Karl Marx&#x27;s earlier, more Hegelian period, at a time when the French interest in Hegel was at its apogee. In 1963, he was elected to the Collège de France and given a chair in &quot;The History of Philosophical Thought&quot;.

While philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre were known for producing new works influenced by German philosophy, Hyppolite is remembered as an expositor, teacher, and translator. He influenced a number of thinkers, including Gilles Deleuze, who studied Hegel under him at the Lycée Henri-IV, and Michel Foucault, as well as Jacques Derrida, Gérard Granel and Étienne Balibar (at the ENS).

Hyppolite died in Paris.

<text>A churrascaria () is a place where meat is cooked in &quot;churrasco&quot; style, which translates roughly from the Portuguese word for &quot;barbecue&quot;. 

&quot;Churrascaria&quot; cuisine is typically (but not always) served &quot;rodízio&quot; style, where roving waiters serve the barbecued meats from large skewers directly onto the seated diners&#x27; plates.

==Terminology==
Related terminology comes from the Portuguese language. A &quot;churrasqueiro&quot; is somebody who cooks &quot;churrasco&quot; style food in a &quot;churrascaria&quot; restaurant or at home. A &quot;churrasqueira&quot; is a barbecue grill used for this style of cooking.

==History==
Distinctly a South American style rotisserie, it owes its origins to the fireside roasts of the gaúchos of southern Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, traditionally from the Pampa region, centuries ago.

==Contemporary &quot;churrascarias&quot;==
In modern restaurants &quot;rodízio&quot; service is typically offered. (waiters) come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are speared various kinds of meat, be it beef, pork, filet mignon, lamb, chicken, duck, ham (with pineapple), sausage, fish, or any other sort of local cut of meat. A common cut of beef top sirloin cap is known as &quot;picanha&quot;. In addition to the table service, a self-service buffet of salad, bread, rice, and farofa is offered.

===Brazil===
In most parts of Brazil, the &quot;churrasco&quot; is roasted over charcoal. In the south of Brazil, however, mostly close to the borders of Argentina and Uruguay, embers of wood are also used.

===Portugal===
Throughout Portugal there are various grills located in towns, cities, and also by the roadside on national highways. While &quot;churrasqueira&quot; restaurants offer the typical fare of barbecued &quot;&quot; (chicken), beef or pork, they may also offer rotisserie chicken and a variety of other culinary dishes.

===United States===
&quot;Churrascaria&quot; cuisine combined with &quot;rodízio&quot; style service has become more popular in the US, expanding to a number of cities.

<doc id="811054" wikidata="Q4259456" url="?curid=811054" title="David Leslie, 1st Lord Newark">
<text>David Leslie, 1st Lord Newark ( – ) was a Scottish military officer and peer. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, he joined in the Swedish Army in 1630 and served under Alexander Leslie. Returning to Scotland in the final days of the Bishops&#x27; War, Leslie fought in the English Civil War and Scottish Civil Wars on the side of the Covenanters and Royalists. After the Stuart Restoration, Leslie was raised to the peerage of Scotland as Lord Newark by Charles II of Scotland.

==Early life==
David Leslie was the fifth son of Sir Patrick Leslie, 1st Lord Lindores, and Jean, daughter of Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney.

==Thirty Years War==
David Leslie was one of the Scots who transferred from Swedish to Russian service under Alexander Leslie of Auchintoul (not to be confused with Leven) in 1632 to participate in the Smolensk War and was mentioned by name in Leslie of Auchintoul&#x27;s testimonial. David Leslie re-appeared in the Swedish army in 1634 where he served as a colonel and thereafter Field Marshal Johan Banér&#x27;s adjutant-general with whom he participated in the Battle of Wittstock in 1636.

==Return to Scotland==
Leslie petitioned to leave Swedish service in August 1640 after being wounded in battle. The Swedish Riksråd (Royal Council) records show that he and Colonel James Lumsden asked to return to Scotland at the same time. The seriousness of Leslie&#x27;s wounds is questionable and it is likely that they were summoned home to support Alexander Leslie&#x27;s Army of the Covenant, then participating in the Bishops&#x27; Wars against Charles I. Both these officers were rewarded with a severance deal which included 200 muskets and 200 suits of armour each. Leslie also received a valuable gold chain as an indication of his loyal service to the Swedish Crown. The Stuart ambassador in Hamburg, Sir Thomas Roe, informed London of Leslie&#x27;s departure with Colonel Lumsden and 24 other Scottish officers from that city. They arrived in Scotland after the Bishops&#x27; Wars had effectively ended.

==Civil War==
After the parliaments of Scotland and England agreed the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643, David Leslie became a Major General under Alexander Leslie (now Earl of Leven) in the Army of the Solemn League and Covenant which was sent to fight alongside the forces of the English Parliament in 1644. He played an important role at the critical Battle of Marston Moor, west of York by leading a successful cavalry charge against the Royalist Cavaliers while Oliver Cromwell was wounded. This allowed the infantry time to regroup and eliminate the Royalist battalia led by another former colleague, Lieutenant General James King, Lord Eythin. David Leslie subsequently commanded the force that besieged Carlisle, Cumbria.

In 1645 Leslie was sent back to Scotland to deal with the Royalists there during the Scottish Civil War. He routed the main Royalist force under James Graham, Marquis of Montrose at the Battle of Philiphaugh (September 1645) and was rewarded by the committee of estates with a present of 50,000 merks and a gold chain; but his victory was marred by the butchery of the captured Irish—men, women and children—to whom quarter had been given. He was then declared lieutenant-general of the forces, and, in addition to his pay as colonel, had a pension settled on him. One of those captured at Philiphaugh was his old commanding officer, Alexander Leslie of Auchintoul, for whom he intervened personally to save from execution. Auchintoul was banished for life, leading to his return to Russia.

Leslie returned to England and was present at the siege of Newark. When Earl of Leven left for Newcastle upon Tyne Leslie took over command of the Scottish army besieging Newark. While he was in command of that army Charles I travelled from Oxford and surrendered to him on 5 May 1646. Newark surrendered the next day.

On his return to Scotland he reduced several of the Highland clans that supported the cause of the king.

In 1647 Leslie besieged Dunaverty Castle which was a Clan MacDonald stronghold. The MacDonalds surrendered and then perhaps 300 of them were killed (the Dunaverty Massacre).

In 1648 he refused to take part in the English expedition of the &quot;engagers&quot;, the enterprise not having the sanction of the Kirk.

Leslie then laid siege to the Royalist garrison at Kincardine Castle. The Castle was being held by &quot;Smooth John&quot; Macnab, Chief of Clan MacNab. When MacNab found that it would not be possible to maintain defence, he led the defenders, sword in hand at the head of 300 men, who cut their way through the besieging force. All made it through apart from the MacNab chief himself and one other man who were captured and sent to Edinburgh as prisoners of war. The chief was sentenced to death but he escaped, rejoined King Charles and continued to fight. MacNab was later killed at the Battle of Worcester in 1651.

In 1650, after Montrose had made another attempt at a Royalist uprising, he was captured by Neil Macleod of Assynt. Macleod, who had fought with Montrose at the siege of Inverness, delivered him up to the Covenanters (see Battle of Carbisdale). General Leslie, who was then at Tain, sent Major General James Holborne with a troop of horse to fetch Montrose to meet his judges. Whilst Montrose was being led to his death Leslie dispatched five troops of horse, including some from Holborne&#x27;s and the John Gordon, 14th Earl of Sutherland&#x27;s regiments to Dunbeath Castle. The defenders refused to yield, holding out valiantly for some days until their water supply was cut off, forcing them to surrender. They were finally marched under escort to Edinburgh, where Montrose was executed.

==Royalist from 1650==
By 1650, the Scottish Covenanter government had grown disillusioned with the English Parliament, and instead backed Charles II in the hope that, in return for their support against his English enemies, he would impose their political and religious agenda on Great Britain. Leslie accordingly now found himself fighting for the King. When the Parliamentarian army under Oliver Cromwell invaded Scotland in July 1650 Leslie commanded the Scottish forces. By refusing battle, Leslie withstood Cromwell&#x27;s attempts to attack Edinburgh and when the English were forced to retreat in August 1650 he pursued them down the east coast, eventually trapping 11,000 English soldiers south of Dunbar. Although the Scottish army had twice as many men, divisions within the Committee of Estates and Kirk instructing Leslie gave Cromwell the opportunity to inflict a decisive defeat on the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar on 3 September 1650. Leslie escaped with a tiny remnant of his army which then joined Charles II&#x27;s Royalist forces in the Stirling area.

Leslie led the Royalist army on another invasion of England in 1651, where he was again defeated by Cromwell, at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. After his capture he was sent to the Tower of London.

Released from captivity on the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, Leslie was granted the title Lord Newark. David Leslie, 1st Lord Newark, died in 1682.

==Family==
David Leslie married Jane Yorke, a daughter of John Yorke of Goulthwaite Hall.

His son David was the 2nd Lord Newark. His daughter Jean Leslie (d. 1740) styled herself as 3rd &quot;Lady Newark&quot; i.e. a lady in her own right. She married Sir Alexander Anstruther of Anstruther in 1694, and their sons William and Alexander were known semi-officially as the 4th and 5th Lords Newark.

His cousin was John Leslie, Lord Newton, a Lord of Session and also a Lt Colonel in the King&#x27;s Horse Guards involved in several of the same battles.

His daughter Mary Leslie married Alexander Kinloch, son of Sir Francis Kinloch, 1st Baronet of Gilmerton.

<text>Lonicera periclymenum, common names honeysuckle, common honeysuckle, European honeysuckle, or woodbine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caprifoliaceae native to much of Europe, North Africa, Turkey and the Caucasus. It is found as far north as southern Norway, Sweden and Finland.

==Description==
Growing to or more in height, it is a vigorous deciduous twining climber, occasionally keeping its old leaves over winter. In the UK it is one of two native honeysuckles, the other being &quot;Lonicera xylosteum&quot;. It is often found in woodland or in hedgerows or scrubland.

The tubular, two-lipped flowers, creamy white or yellowish in colour, may be flushed with pink or red on the outside and in bud, and are carried in showy clusters at the ends of the shoots. The flowers are highly scented by night, much less so by day.

==Ecology==
The plant is usually pollinated by moths or long-tongued bees and develops bright red berries. Dormice make summer nests for their young from honeysuckle bark; they also eat the flowers, which are a good source of energy-rich nectar. Night-flying moths such as the hummingbird hawk-moth can detect the scent of honeysuckle flowers up to a quarter of a mile away. The clusters of red berries are eaten in the autumn by birds such as thrushes, bullfinches and warblers.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Lonicera periclymenum&quot; is one of several honeysuckle species valued in the garden, for its ability to twine around other plants, or to cover unsightly walls or outbuildings; and for the intense fragrance of its profuse flowers in summer. It needs to be planted with its roots in the shade, and its flowering top in sun or light shade. Plants need to be chosen with care as they can grow to a substantial size. The cultivars &#x27;Graham Thomas&#x27; and &#x27;Serotina&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

==Pests==
&quot;Chromatomyia aprilina&quot; – honeysuckle leaf miner

==Cultural references==
In William Shakespeare’s play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; he refers to woodbine/honeysuckle twice:
#(Act II Scene 1) &quot;Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine&quot;
#(Act IV Scene 1) &quot;So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwine&quot;

It seems probable that the first quotation is referring to the honeysuckle &quot;L. periclymenum&quot;, a common sight in hedgerows in Shakespeare’s time. The second quotation is somewhat more confusing. It is thought that on this occasion, &quot;woodbine&quot; refers to a species of &quot;Convolvulus&quot;, also very common but nowadays called &quot;bindweed&quot;.

<text>Christopher Charles Collins (born Christopher Lawrence Latta; August 30, 1949 – June 12, 1994) was an American actor and stand-up comedian. He is best known as the voice of Cobra Commander in the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; animated series and Starscream in the first &quot;Transformers&quot; animated series. He had a few guest roles in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, he voice acted Moe Szyslak and Mr. Burns in the first season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1989–1990), and he had many other roles in television series and films. He also had a successful stand-up comedy career.

==Early life==
Christopher Lawrence Latta was born in Orange, New Jersey to Robert Latta (1920–1966), a New York stage actor, and Jane Morin (1925–2001), an advertising executive. He grew up in the Morningside Heights (sometimes called &quot;West Harlem&quot;) section of Manhattan, New York City. His legal name became Christopher Charles Collins when his stepfather adopted him.

After a year at New York University, he studied acting, dance, voice, and mime in Paris.

==Career==
===Radio work and stand-up comedy===
In the mid-1970s, he acted on the New York and Boston stage and did voice-over work for Boston radio station WBCN.

Collins&#x27;s stand-up career peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when he performed in most of the major comedy venues in the United States and Canada. In 1990, he won the San Francisco International Stand-Up Comedy Competition.

===Voice acting===
Collins made his animation voice acting debut as one of the English dubbers of the 1979 anime series &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (also called &quot;Star Blazers&quot;). He was most recognizable in that series as the voice of space marine Sgt. Knox during the Comet Empire installment.

When he began regular voice work, he adopted the stage name Chris Latta, as another Screen Actors Guild actor was performing as Chris Collins.

In 1983, Collins began voicing Cobra Commander for a five-part &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; animated mini-series. He continued voicing the role in a second five-part animated mini-series in 1984, a regular animated series beginning in 1985, a 1987 direct-to-video animated movie and a 1989 animated series. Starting in 1984, Collins voiced the Decepticon Starscream for the &quot;Transformers&quot; animated series. He voiced other G.I. Joe and Transformers characters in these series as well as in toy commercials. These included the Autobot scientist Wheeljack, the Autobots&#x27; human friend Sparkplug Witwicky, the G.I. Joe Marine Gung-Ho and the Dreadnok Ripper. In &quot;Inhumanoids&quot;, he voiced D&#x27;Compose and Tendril. In &quot;&quot;, he voiced Darkstorm and Cravex. He provided voices in &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, credited as Chris Collins.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Collins originated the voice of Mr. Burns in the first-season episodes &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;, and &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, and recorded lines as Moe Szyslak for &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; and &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; (but was dubbed over in the latter). Along with several other early &quot;Simpsons&quot; voice actors, he left during the first season. Hank Azaria took over the voice of Moe, while Harry Shearer assumed the role of Mr. Burns. In a 2018 interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, Azaria commented on replacing Collins as Moe, saying that he did not find out until years later that he had replaced another actor. Azaria said that when he asked why he had replaced Collins, he was told by Matt Groening, &quot;He (Collins) was great... He was just a dick. His voice was great, he was just kind of jerky to everyone.&quot; Azaria continued, &quot;Think about how awful—that guy could have been on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; his whole life. Lesson to you kids: Always be nice!&quot;

===Live action===
Later in the 1980s, he adopted the stage name of Christopher Collins and acted in many live-action television series and motion pictures. In &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, he played Klingon Captain Kargan in the episode &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; and Pakled Captain Grebnedlog in the episode &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot;. In &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, he portrayed two different Markalians: Durg in &quot;The Passenger&quot;, and an unnamed assistant to The Albino in &quot;Blood Oath&quot;. In &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, he played Roger, one of Al Bundy&#x27;s bowling buddies and a member of NO MA&#x27;AM (National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood). He portrayed a mugger on an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled &quot;The Subway&quot;. He appears as Mr. Forbes in a first-season episode of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; titled &quot;Abandando Abandoned&quot;. In 1989, he hosted &quot;King Koopa&#x27;s Kool Kartoons&quot;, but was later fired from the show and replaced with Patrick Pinney allegedly due to inappropriate behavior toward crew and audience members.

His first live-action feature film appearance is a bit part as the sharing husband in the film &quot;Road House&quot;. He appeared in &quot;True Identity&quot;, &quot;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&quot;, &quot;Blue Desert&quot;, and &quot;A Stranger Among Us&quot;.

On April 28, 2012, Collins was posthumously inducted into the Transformers Hall of Fame. His daughter Abigail accepted on his behalf.

==Personal life==
Collins married twice and had three children. Early in his career, he divided his time between New York, Boston, and Los Angeles before settling in L.A. in 1983. In 1991, he moved to Ventura, California.

In an interview, Flint Dille recalled: 
==Death==
Collins died on June 12, 1994, at the age of 44, due to complications of encephalitis.

<text>Z-fighting, also called stitching or planefighting, is a phenomenon in 3D rendering that occurs when two or more primitives have very similar distances to the camera. This would cause them to have near-similar or identical values in the z-buffer, which keeps track of depth. This then means that when a specific pixel is being rendered, it is ambiguous which one of the two primitives are drawn in that pixel because the z-buffer cannot distinguish precisely which one is farther from the other. If one pixel was unambiguously closer, the less close one could be discarded. It is particularly prevalent with coplanar polygons, where two faces occupy essentially the same space, with neither in front. As a result, affected pixels are rendered with fragments from one polygon or the other arbitrarily, in a manner determined by the precision of the z-buffer. It can also vary as the scene or camera is changed, causing one polygon to &quot;win&quot; the z test, then another, and so on. The overall effect is flickering, noisy rasterization of two polygons which &quot;fight&quot; to color the screen pixels. This problem is usually caused by limited sub-pixel precision, floating point and fixed point round-off errors.

The more z-buffer precision one uses, the less likely it is that z-fighting will be encountered. But for coplanar polygons, the problem is inevitable unless corrective action is taken.

As the distance between near and far clip planes increases, and in particular the near plane is selected near the eye, the greater the likelihood exists that z-fighting between primitives will occur. With large virtual environments inevitably there is an inherent conflict between the need to resolve visibility in the distance and in the foreground, so for example in a space flight simulator, if a distant galaxy is drawn to scale, the viewer will not have the precision to resolve visibility on any cockpit geometry in the foreground (although even a numerical representation would present problems prior to z-buffered rendering). To mitigate these problems, z-buffer precision is weighted towards the near clip plane, but this is not the case with all visibility schemes and it is insufficient to eliminate all z-fighting issues.

== Mitigation ==
Z-fighting can be reduced through the use of a higher resolution depth buffer, by z-buffering in some scenarios, or by simply moving the polygons further apart. Z-fighting which cannot be entirely eliminated in this manner is often resolved by the use of a stencil buffer, or by applying a post-transformation screen space z-buffer offset to one polygon which does not affect the projected shape on screen but does affect the z-buffer value to eliminate the overlap during pixel interpolation and comparison. Where z-fighting is caused by different transformation paths in hardware for the same geometry (for example in a multi-pass rendering scheme) it can sometimes be resolved by requesting that the hardware use invariant vertex transformation.

Z-fighting that is caused by insufficient precision in the depth buffer can be resolved by simply reducing the visible distance in the world. This reduces the distance between the near and far planes and solves the precision issue. However, in certain virtual environments where long-distance visibility is essential or where reduced visibility would be unbelievable, such as a space simulator or a flight simulator, this is not possible. Alternative techniques exist in these cases. One of these techniques is to &quot;simulate&quot; the distance of objects far from the user without actually changing their position. For example, if the maximum safe view distance (beyond which z-fighting occurs) is 10,000 units, and an object to be rendered is 15,000 units away, that object could instead be rendered at 10,000 units but it could be scaled down in proportion to the distance that it was moved. So, an object that has been scaled down by half will look like it is twice as far as it actually is. If this is done only for objects that are already close to, or at, the maximum view distance, and objects close to the user are rendered normally, this technique should not be noticeable. Another technique that is utilized to reduce or completely eliminate Z-fighting is switching to a logarithmic Z-buffer, reversing Z. This technique is seen in the game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. Due to the way they are encoded, floating-point numbers have much more precision when closer to 0. Here, reversing Z leads to more precision when storing the depth of very distant objects, hence greatly reducing Z-fighting.

<text>Sonya Thomas (born Lee Sun-kyung on July 26, 1967), also known by her nickname The Black Widow, and &quot;The Leader of the Four Horsemen of the Esophagus&quot;, is a South Korean-born American competitive eater from Alexandria, Virginia. Thomas joined the International Federation of Competitive Eating in 2003 and quickly rose to the top of the ranks, beating competitive eaters such as Eric Booker.

Her nickname &quot;The Black Widow&quot; refers to her ability to regularly defeat men four to five times her size. While the size of her stomach is only slightly larger than normal, her skinny build is perhaps her biggest advantage, allowing her stomach to expand more readily since it is not surrounded by the ring of fat common in other heavy eaters. She holds records in over 25 eating competitions, and in December 2008, she set the world record for fruit-cake eaten in 10 minutes.
On July 4, 2005, she ate 37 hot dogs in 12 minutes at Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest, setting a then-record for American competitors (which was also the female record). On August 8, 2005, she consumed 35 bratwursts in 10 minutes, beating the previous 10-minute record of 19.5 bratwursts, although her record was beaten in 2006 by Takeru Kobayashi.

On July 4, 2011, Thomas became the first champion of Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women. Eating 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, Thomas earned the inaugural pink Pepto Bismol Belt and won $10,000. She defended and held on to that title the following year eating 46 hot dogs. On July 4, 2013, she again defended her title by eating 36 hot dogs, just beating out Juliet Lee who ate 36 hot dogs.

==Competition==

===Champion===
Thomas&#x27;s first major victory that put her on the competitive eating map was in the 2004 Wing Bowl, where she became the first woman to win a Wing Bowl. Her tally of 32 hot dogs in the 2004 Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog contest was the most ever eaten by a male or female American competitor at the time. The only eaters besides Kobayashi to defeat Thomas between the 2004 and 2005 Nathan&#x27;s contests were Bill &quot;El Wingador&quot; Simmons in the 2005 Wing Bowl, and Dale Boone, who cooled overheated baked beans in order to win an eating contest.

On July 4, 2011, Thomas became the first champion of Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women. Eating 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, Thomas earned the inaugural Pink Belt and won $10,000.

Thomas had won 1st place in the National Buffalo Wing Festival US chicken wing eating championship five-years straight from 2007 to 2011. On September 4, 2011, she attained the United States Chicken Wing Eating Championship in Buffalo, New York, by eating 183 chicken wings in 12 minutes. On September 2, 2012 Joey Chestnut consumed 191 wings, weighing in 12 minutes to take competitive-eating trophy from the five-year champion Sonya Thomas.

===Challenge and response===
When Thomas undertook a challenging schedule of three contests in three cities on Labor Day weekend 2005, she had not lost a contest to anyone besides Kobayashi since the Wing Bowl in early February. Several last-minute victories foreshadowed that her streak would not last forever. At the Buffalo Wing Festival in Buffalo, NY, Ms. Thomas lost to Eric &quot;Badlands&quot; Booker in a chicken wing contest and then lost a waffle eating contest in Atlanta the next day to the fast-rising rookie Joey Chestnut, giving her a two event losing streak to replace her winning streak. Thomas&#x27; waffle defeat was avenged on Labor Day, however, when she out-ate Chestnut in the Chattanooga, TN Krystal Square Off qualifier. Thomas ate 57 Krystal Burgers to Chestnut&#x27;s 56.

Before the GoldenPalace.com turkey eating contest in New York City Thanksgiving Eve, Thomas had gone three months without winning a non-qualifying contest, although she did have two impressive victories in qualifiers during that span. It appeared that Chestnut would soon claim the title of the leading American eater from Thomas. The civil engineering student from San Jose State had defeated Thomas in three of their last four match-ups and was the first eater to lead Kobayashi for the majority of a contest at the Krystal Square Off in Chattanooga the previous week. Although Thomas came in third, the silver lining was her domination of Kobayashi on a pound for pound basis: Thomas 56 burgers / 100 lb. = 0.56, Kobayashi 67 burgers / 170 lb. = 0.39.

At the turkey contest, Thomas was able to dramatically reverse her recent slump and defeat Chestnut without last second heroics, which she had not been able to do since Nathan&#x27;s hot dog contest on July 4. Thomas&#x27; momentum continued the following week at a meatball contest in Atlantic City. Her total of beat Chestnut by and almost doubled her total from the previous year&#x27;s meatball contest. Thomas&#x27; continued improvement, along with Chestnut&#x27;s rapid ascent, gave Kobayashi more to worry about in 2006 than at any previous time in his dominant career.

On August 13, 2006, Thomas won her Asian debut competition in Hong Kong while setting her 28th eating record, by consuming 17 Chinese-style lotus seed buns in 12 minutes.

===In the media===
She was featured in a MasterCard Paypass commercial. By accident, she meets Takeru Kobayashi, a male competitor, in a convenience store. Their eyes flash, and they begin a hot dog eating duel, which they pay for using the Paypass card.

<doc id="811108" wikidata="Q381240" url="?curid=811108" title="Isra' and Mi'raj">
<text>The Israʾ and Miʿraj (, &#x27;) are the two parts of aNight Journey that Muslims believe the Islamic prophet Muhammad (AD 570–632) took during a single night around the year AD 621 (1 BH – 0 BH). 
It is a story that has been developed and told in different versions, like many other stories in the Islamic tradition. In the &quot;Israʾ&quot; (&quot;Night Journey&quot;), Muhammad is said to have traveled on the back of Buraq (a winged horse-like bird) to Al-Aqsa (i.e. the Noble Sanctuary), where he led other prophets including Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), and Isa (Jesus) in prayer.

Muhammad then ascended into heaven during the &quot;Miʿraj&quot; (Ascension), where he individually greeted the prophets, and later spoke to God, who agreed to lower the number of required &quot;ṣalāt&quot; (ritual prayer) from 50 a day to only five. The story of the journey and ascent are marked as one of the most celebrated in the Islamic calendar—27th of the Islamic month of Rajab.

Within Islam, the majority of Islamic scholars claim that the journey was both a physical and spiritual one. Islamic tradition believes a brief mention of the story is found in the 17th surah (chapter) of the Quran, called &quot;al-Isra&#x27;&quot;, while details of the story are found in the &quot;hadith&quot; (the later collections of the reports, teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad).

==Terminology==
&quot;Isra&quot; means walking or traveling at night; &quot;miʿraj&quot; means rising, or going up to a high place.

==Basis in Islamic sources==

The events of Isra and Miʿraj are mentioned briefly in the Quran and then further expanded and interpreted within the hadith (the literary corpus of reported sayings of Muhammad), which form supplements to the Quran. Two hadith sources on the Isra and Miʿraj considered the most reliable are Anas ibn Malik and ibn ʿAbbas. Both are considered &quot;Companions of the Prophet,&quot; but were young boys at the time of Muhammad&#x27;s journey of Mi&#x27;raj.

===The Quran===

Within the Quran, ) 17 &quot;al-Israʾ&quot; was named after the Israʾ, and the first verse contains a brief description. There is also some information in a later verse, and some scholars say a verse in also holds information on the Isra and Miʿraj.

===Hadith===
Various hadiths contain much greater detail. The is the part of the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to the farthest place of worship, though the city is not explicitly mentioned. The journey began when Muhammad was in the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, and the Archangel Gabriel came to him and brought Buraq, the heavenly mount of the prophets. Buraq carried Muhammad to the &quot;farthest place of worship.&quot; Muhammad alighted, tethered Buraq and performed prayer, where on God&#x27;s command he was tested by Gabriel. It was told by Anas ibn Malik that Muhammad said: &quot;Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine, a vessel of water and a vessel of milk, and I chose the milk. Gabriel said: &#x27;You have chosen the fitra (natural instinct).&#x27;&quot; In the second part of the journey, the &quot;ladder,&quot; Gabriel took him to the heavens, where he toured the seven heavens and spoke with the earlier prophets: Abraham, Moses, John the Baptist, and Jesus. Muhammad was then taken to the Sidrat al-Muntaha – the tree of life appearing as a lote tree (&quot;Ziziphus spina-christi&quot;) in the seventh heaven past which Gabriel was not allowed. According to Islamic tradition, God instructed Muhammad that Muslims must pray fifty times per day; however, Moses told Muhammad that it was too challenging for the people and urged Muhammad to ask for a reduction until finally it was reduced to five times per day.

====The Miraj ====

There are different accounts of what occurred during the Miʿraj. Al-Tabari&#x27;s description of the Miʿraj can be summarized as follows: Muhammad ascends into heaven with the angel Gabriel and meets a different prophet at each of the seven levels of heaven; first Adam, then John the Baptist and Jesus, then Joseph, then Idris, then Aaron, then Moses, and lastly Abraham. After Muhammad meets with Abraham, he continues to meet God without Gabriel. God tells Muhammad that his people must pray 50 times a day, but as Muhammad returns to Earth, he meets Moses, who tells Muhammad to return to God and ask for fewer prayers because fifty is too many. Muhammad goes between Moses and God nine times, until the prayers are reduced to the five daily prayers, which God will reward tenfold. Other accounts, such as Muhammad al-Bukhari, ibn Ishaq, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, vary by details to some extend.

Some narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad&#x27;s chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad&#x27;s chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place—before or after the ascent—but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad&#x27;s spiritual righteousness.

====Ibn ʿAbbas Primitive Version====

Ibn ʿAbbas&#x27; Primitive Versions narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), Half-Fire Half-Snow angel (who provides an example of God&#x27;s power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the Angel of Death (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the Guardian of Hellfire (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn ʿAbbas&#x27; narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad&#x27;s ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn ʿAbbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn ʿAbbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called cherubim. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God&#x27;s creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn ʿAbbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets. These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn ʿAbbas uses in his Primitive Version.

In an attempt to reestablish Ibn ʿAbbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn ʿAbbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn ʿAbbas&#x27;s Primitive Version.

==== Sufi interpretations====
The belief that Muhammad made the heavenly journey bodily was used to prove the unique status of Muhammad. One theory among Sufis was that Muhammad&#x27;s body could reach God to a proximity that even the greatest saints could only reach in spirit. They debated whether Muhammad had really seen the Lord and if he did, whether he did so with his eyes or with his heart. Nevertheless, Muhammad&#x27;s superiority is again demonstrated in that even in the extreme proximity of the Lord, &quot;his eye neither swerved nor was turned away,&quot; whereas Moses had fainted when the Lord appeared to him in a burning bush. Various thinkers used this point to prove the superiority of Muhammad.

The Subtleties of the Ascension by Abu ʿAbd al-Rahman al-Sulami includes repeated quotations from other mystics that also affirm the superiority of Muhammad. Many Sufis interpreted the Miʿraj to ask questions about the meaning of certain events within the Miʿraj, and drew conclusions based on their interpretations, especially to substantiate ideas of the superiority of Muhammad over other prophets.

Muhammad Iqbal, a self-proclaimed intellectual descendant of Rumi and the poet-scholar who personified poetic Sufism in South Asia, used the event of the Miʿraj to conceptualize an essential difference between a prophet and a Sufi. He recounts that Muhammad, during his Miʿraj journey, visited the heavens and then eventually returned to the temporal world. Iqbal then quotes another South Asian Muslim saint by the name of &#x27;Abdul Quddus Gangohi who asserted that if he (Gangohi) had had that experience, he would never have returned to this world. Iqbal uses Gangohi&#x27;s spiritual aspiration to argue that while a saint or a Sufi would not wish to renounce the spiritual experience for something this-worldly, a prophet is a prophet precisely because he returns with a force so powerful that he changes world history by imbuing it with a creative and fresh thrust.

===Alternative Muslim interpretations===
====Mystical interpretations====
Many sects and offshoots belonging to Islamic mysticism interpret Muhammad&#x27;s night ascent – the Isra and Miʿraj – to be an out-of-body experience through nonphysical environments, unlike the Sunni Muslims or mainstream Islam. The mystics claim Muhammad was transported to the farthest place of worship and then onward to the Seven Heavens, even though &quot;the apostle&#x27;s body remained where it was.&quot;

==== Alternative locations ====
Israeli political scientist Yitzhak Reiter mentions some alternative interpretations among some Muslim sects in the 21st century which dispute that the night journey took place in Jerusalem, believing instead it was either in the Heavens, or in Medina and its vicinity by Jaf&#x27;ari Shi&#x27;tes.

====Of mutating hadith====
Another question (more than an interpretation) is whether Isra&#x27; and Mi&#x27;raj originally belonged together.
According to Britannica, in &quot;the earliest interpretations of the Miʿrāj&quot;, while he is in the Kaʿbah in Mecca, Muhammad&#x27;s body is cut open by the angel Jibrīl, cleansed and purified, before being transported by Jibrīl &quot;directly to the lowest heaven&quot;. But sometime &quot;early in Islamic history&quot; this story of purification and ascension to heaven began to be associated with the story of a night journey (Isrāʾ) by Muhammad from the “sacred place of worship” (Mecca) to the “further place of worship” (Jerusalem). Eventually the night journey came to be combined with Muhammad&#x27;s purification and ascension, falling between the two in the sequence, so that after his purification Muhammad is &quot;transported in a single night from Mecca to Jerusalem by the winged mythical creature Burāq. From Jerusalem, where the Dome of the Rock now stands, he is accompanied by Jibrīl to heaven, ascending possibly by ladder or staircase (miʿrāj).&quot; This interpretation shares the belief that the Isra&#x27; Mecca-to-Jerusalem story does not belong with the other two, according to Yitzhak Reiter.

==European sources==

In the 13th century AD, an account of the Isra&#x27; and Mi&#x27;raj was translated into several European languages—Latin, Spanish and French. Known as the &quot;Book of Muhammad&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, this account purports to be the words of Muhammad himself as recorded by Ibn Abbas. It was translated by Abraham of Toledo and Bonaventure of Siena. It may have influenced Dante Alighieri&#x27;s account of an ascent to heaven and descent to hell in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

==Modern Muslim observance==
The &quot;Lailat al-Miʿraj&quot; (, ), also known as &quot;Shab-e-Mi&#x27;raj&quot; (, , ) in Iran, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, and &quot;Miraç Kandili&quot; in Turkish, is the Muslim holiday on the 27th of Rajab (the date varying in the Western calendar) celebrating the Isra and Miʿraj. Another name for the holiday is &quot;Mehraj-ul-Alam&quot; (also spelled &quot;Meraj-ul-Alam&quot;). Some Muslims celebrate this event by offering optional prayers during this night, and in some Muslim countries, by illuminating cities with electric lights and candles. The celebrations around this day tend to focus on every Muslim who wants to celebrate it. Worshippers gather into mosques and perform prayer and supplication. Some people may pass their knowledge on to others by telling them the story on how Muhammad&#x27;s heart was purified by the archangel Gabriel, who filled him with knowledge and faith in preparation to enter the seven levels of heaven. After salah, food and treats are served.

In Jerusalem on the Temple Mount, the structure of the Dome of the Rock, built several decades after Muhammad&#x27;s death, marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven. The exact date of the Journey is not clear, but is celebrated as though it took place before the Hijrah and after Muhammad&#x27;s visit to the people of Ta&#x27;if. The normative view amongst Sunni Muslims who ascribe a specific date to the event is that it took place on the 27th of Rajab, slightly over a year before Hijrah. This would correspond to the 26th of February 621 in the Western calendar. In Twelver Iran, Rajab 27 is the day of Muhammad&#x27;s first calling or &quot;Mab&#x27;as&quot;. The al-Aqsa Mosque and surrounding area is now the third-holiest place on earth for Muslims.

==Historical issues==
===Jerusalem site===
A small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. This was rebuilt and expanded by the caliph Abd al-Malik in AD 690 along with the Dome of the Rock. In the reign of the caliph Mu&#x27;awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif.

A hadith reports Muhammad&#x27;s account of the experience:

==== Secular scholarship ====
Although the city of Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in Surah Al-Isra 17:1, the consensus of Islamic scholars is that Quranic reference to &quot;masjid al-aqṣā&quot; in the verse refers to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is mentioned in later Islamic literature and in the hadith as the place of Isra and Miʽraj.

Regardless however, some figures contest the consensus that &quot;Al-masjid al-aqṣā&quot; was in Jerusalem, and believe it was somewhere other than Jerusalem. This arises from the belief that there&#x27;s no evidence of a Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem prior to the Islamic conquest of the Levant, and Umar&#x27;s arrival

The first and second temples were destroyed by the Babylonians and the Romans, respectively, the latter more than five centuries before Muhammad&#x27;s life. After the initially successful Jewish revolt against Heraclius, the Jewish population resettled in Jerusalem for a short period of time from AD 614 to 630 and immediately started to restore the temple on the Temple Mount and build synagogues in Jerusalem. After the Jewish population was expelled a second time from Jerusalem and shortly before Heraclius retook the city (AD 630), a small synagogue was already in place on the Temple Mount. This synagogue was reportedly demolished after Heraclius retook Jerusalem.

French American Academic Oleg Grabar believed that the Quranic &quot;Al-masjid al-aqṣā&quot; referred to one of two sanctuaries in a Hijazi village known as al-Juʽranah near Mecca, basing this on the statement of two near-contemporary medieval Muslim travelers Al Waqidi and Al-Azraqi who used the term &quot;&quot;Al-masjid al-aqṣā&quot; ,&quot; and &quot;Al-masjid al-Adna&quot;:

Israeli Political Scientist Yitzhak Reiter also claimed that the location being in Jerusalem was a tradition invented after Muhmmad&#x27;s life by the Umayyad Caliphate to divert pilgrimage to either Shi&#x27;ite sites such as Al-Kufa, or Mecca when it was held by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr during the Second Muslim Civil war

== Similarities to other Abrahamic traditions ==
Traditions of living persons ascending to heaven are also found in early Jewish and Christian literature. The Book of Enoch, a late Second Temple Jewish apocryphal work, describes a tour of heaven given by an angel to the patriarch Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. According to Brooke Vuckovic, early Muslims may have had precisely this ascent in mind when interpreting Muhammad&#x27;s night journey.

<text>(AJPW/AJP) or simply All Japan is a Japanese professional wrestling promotion established on October 21, 1972, when Giant Baba split away from the Japanese Wrestling Association and created his own promotion. Many wrestlers had left with Baba, with many more joining the following year when JWA folded. From the mid-1970s, All Japan was firmly established as the largest promotion in Japan. As the 1990s began, aging stars gave way to a younger generation including Mitsuharu Misawa, &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams, Kenta Kobashi, Gary Albright, Toshiaki Kawada, Mike Barton (Bart Gunn), Akira Taue and Jun Akiyama, leading to perhaps AJPW&#x27;s most profitable period in the 1990s.

In 1999, Giant Baba died and the promotion was run by Motoko Baba. Misawa was named president but left in 2000 after disagreements with Motoko. Misawa created Pro Wrestling Noah and every single native wrestler besides Masanobu Fuchi and Toshiaki Kawada left All Japan. This led to a loss of All Japan&#x27;s TV deal and a period of hardship for the company. In 2001, they entered a cross-promotion agreement with New Japan Pro-Wrestling which proved very successful, allowing All Japan to remain one of the larger promotions in the country, although now firmly behind NJPW.

In January 2002, Keiji Muto defected to All Japan, and was officially appointed as its new president that September. He would then acquire the rights to the company and Baba family stock by early 2003, when another exodus of gaijin wrestlers began, most notably Steve Williams, KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark), Bill Goldberg and Mike Rotunda. Not long after George Hines and Johnny Smith also left.

By mid-2005, All Japan&#x27;s attendance had dropped and the promotion seemed to be in trouble again but by 2007 had new sponsors and seemed to have recovered. After Misawa and most of the other wrestlers left the promotion, there was a lull in developing new stars until the likes of KAI, Suwama, Hama and T28 debuted from the mid-2000s onward and helped restrengthen the company.

With established stars such as Keiji Muto, Satoshi Kojima, John &quot;Earthquake&quot; Tenta, Masakatsu Funaki, D&#x27;Lo Brown and Minoru Suzuki anchoring the promotion, the younger wrestlers were given time to grow and by 2010 were set to help lead All Japan. While still without a great TV deal, All Japan has operated consistently since 1972, making it the second-longest running promotion in Japan.

== History ==
=== All Japan under Giant Baba (1972–1999) ===
==== NWA membership ====

The promotion was founded by Shohei &quot;Giant&quot; Baba and the Momota brothers, Mitsuo and Yoshihiro, sons of Rikidōzan. Baba, a former professional baseball pitcher, joined the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA) in 1960. In October 1972, he left the JWA and formed his own group, All Japan. Their first card was on October 21, 1972, at Machida City Gym in Tokyo, Japan. The inaugural roster included Baba, Mitsuo Momota, Akio Sato, Samson Kutsuwada, Motoshi Okuma and Mashio Koma. Thunder Sugiyama, who had recently left International Wrestling Enterprise, also came along to help and brought some lower-level IWE wrestlers with him on a freelance basis. Some personalities from North America also helped with the few cards, including Dory Funk Sr., Terry Funk, Bruno Sammartino, Dominic DeNucci, Freddie Blassie and The Destroyer.

Baba established the Pacific Wrestling Federation (PWF) as the governing body for all future titles in All Japan. In the beginning the PWF recognized a world heavyweight championship and several &quot;regional championships&quot; given as billing to foreign stars depending from which region they came from, but after All Japan joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the PWF world title was downgraded to a regional championship. The first PWF Chairman, who presented the belts to the winners in title bouts, was Lord James Blears. As a loyal member of the NWA, All Japan enjoyed the ability to bring in foreigners, and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was frequently defended. In the beginning Baba continued the Japanese vs. foreigner formula for the championships, but gradually Dory Funk Jr. and his brother Terry Funk, as well as Mil Máscaras from Mexico became fan favorites when wrestling other foreigners and subsequently one of the few foreign wrestlers to become icons in Japan.

==== Separation from the NWA, new stars and company growth ====
When the NWA territorial system collapsed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Baba distanced himself from other promoters at home and abroad, and began a system of promoting talent (both Japanese and foreign) who competed exclusively for his promotion. With the unification of the titles in All Japan into the Triple Crown Heavyweight and the World Tag Team Championship, as well as the promotion of talent including Jumbo Tsuruta, Genichiro Tenryu, Akira Taue, Mitsuharu Misawa, Toshiaki Kawada and Kenta Kobashi, the promotion was able to carve a loyal fanbase that lasted during the 1990s. Interpromotional matches were rare, and wrestlers who arrived from other Japanese promotions (such as Hiroshi Hase, Shigeo Okumura and Yoshihiro Takayama) were not given pushes, but in Hase&#x27;s case, it was voluntarily, due to his primary involvement with the House of Councillors.

Gaijins who signed with AJPW full-time were given pushes regardless of which promotion they arrived, most notably Stan Hansen, &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams, Gary Albright, Vader and Mike Barton.

All Japan would achieve its third best-selling attendance with an attendance of 58,300 in the Tokyo Dome on the May 1, 1998 pay-per-view, having seen consistent growth since 1992. On the March 4, 1992 pay-per-view All Japan sold out the Nippon Budokan for the first time, with an attendance of 16,300.

All Japan&#x27;s highest-selling show was the Giant Baba Memorial pay-per-view on May 2, 1999, which sold out the Tokyo Dome with an attendance of 65,000. The January 28, 2001 pay-per-view was All Japan&#x27;s second highest attendance of all time at 58,700, which was notable for Stan Hansen&#x27;s retirement and the Steve Williams vs. Mike Barton Brawl For All revenge angle. The last two matches of the card featuring Keiji Muto vs. Taiyō Kea, as well as the main event tag-team match, did not appear on the initial television broadcast in 2001, the original broadcast instead ending with Williams finally getting his redemption and defeating Barton in the main event.

==== First exodus: Super World of Sports ====
In April 1990, Genichiro Tenryu led the first exodus of wrestlers (The Great Kabuki, Samson Fuyuki, Tatsumi Kitahara, Masao Orihara, Yoshiaki Yatsu, Goro Tsurumi, and Shinichi Nakano) lured as they were to form Super World of Sports, which enabled Baba to push Misawa, Kawada, Taue and Kobashi to be his new stars.

=== All Japan under Mitsuharu Misawa (1999–2000) ===
With the death of Shohei &quot;Giant&quot; Baba on January 31, 1999, top star Mitsuharu Misawa immediately inherited the position of company president. On May 28, 2000, Misawa was removed from his position by a majority vote of the executive board. At a regular All Japan board meeting on June 13, 2000, Misawa, Mitsuo Momota (co-vice president, member of directory), Kenta Kobashi (member of directory), Akira Taue (member of directory, chairman), Kenichi Oyagi (member of directory) and Yoshihiro Momota (member of directory) resigned from their board positions. A day later, Motoko Baba (&quot;Mrs. Baba&quot;) released a two-page written statement, which claimed that Misawa &quot;took no responsibility and abandoned his duty.&quot; In addition, she hinted that Toshiaki Kawada and Masanobu Fuchi would be the only two native wrestlers to stay with All Japan, as &quot;Kawada and Fuchi have sworn to carry out Baba-san&#x27;s last wish: to keep All Japan Pro Wrestling alive&quot;; this was confirmed a day later when Kawada and Fuchi both renewed their contracts with All Japan, along with referee Kyohei Wada. The gaijin wrestlers that chose to stay with AJPW were Maunakea Mossman, Johnny Smith, George Hines, Mike Barton, Jim Steele, Mike Rotunda, Stan Hansen and &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams, while Scorpio, Vader and Richard Slinger joined Misawa&#x27;s crew. Not wanting to choose sides, Johnny Ace would retire from active competition and return to World Championship Wrestling in the United States as a road agent.

==== Second exodus: Pro Wrestling Noah ====

On June 16, 2000, 24 out of the 26 contracted native wrestlers for All Japan were led by Misawa for a press conference, where it was announced that they would be leaving the promotion (Masanobu Fuchi and Toshiaki Kawada remained). More than 100 reporters and photographers attended the press conference, and Misawa expressed his wish for the promotion to debut in August, with the Differ Ariake being the site of the unnamed promotion&#x27;s debut. When asked what his reason for leaving All Japan is, Misawa claimed that it was so he could do things in a &quot;modern style.&quot; A day later, Misawa announced the promotion&#x27;s name: Pro Wrestling Noah, which was inspired by the Biblical story where Noah built an ark and put two of every kind of animal in the world in the ark before God destroyed the world.

On June 19, 2000, it was confirmed (at a press conference at All-Japan&#x27;s dojo held by Toshiaki Kawada and Masanobu Fuchi) that NTV decided to discontinue broadcasting All Japan after 27 years; however, NTV maintained their 15% stock in All Japan (as Motoko Baba held the remaining 85%), and would prevent All Japan from being put on another network. On June 20, twelve All Japan office employees resigned from their positions with the promotion, with intentions to follow Misawa to Noah. NTV also announced that they will carry weekly tapings of Misawa&#x27;s Noah promotion, with the title of the program being called &quot;Colosseo.&quot; Noah took All Japan&#x27;s 30-minute timeslot on Sundays at midnight. Misawa was interviewed in Tokyo on June 21, where he announced that he and the other wrestlers leaving to form Noah would compete on four of the sixteen shows in All Japan&#x27;s Summer Action Series 2000 tour, which began on July 1. NTV also aired the final All Japan TV show on the network, which aired for 45 minutes and featured footage from Jumbo Tsuruta&#x27;s funeral, the Noah wrestlers&#x27; press conference from June 16, Kawada&#x27;s press conference from June 19, highlights of the first ever Kawada vs. Misawa Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship match from October 21, 1992, and Toshiaki Kawada and Akira Taue vs. Yoshihiro Takayama and Takao Omori for the World Tag Team Championship from All Japan&#x27;s Nippon Budokan show from June 9.

On June 28, 2000, Misawa formally announced at a press conference that Pro Wrestling Noah would debut with two consecutive shows (titled &quot;Departure&quot;) in Differ Ariake on August 5 and 6 in Tokyo.

==== Rebuilding ====
On July 2 in the Korakuen Hall, Motoko Baba announced the unfathomable return of Genichiro Tenryu (as Giant Baba publicly swore that he would never be allowed back in All Japan, following a departure in 1990 to form the Super World of Sports), as he would team with Kawada to face Maunnakea Mossman and Stan Hansen on July 23 (at the final tour show). On July 20, 2000, Yoshinobu Kanemaru, Takeshi Morishima, Naomichi Marufuji, Kentaro Shiga, Takeshi Rikio, Mitsuo Momota, Rusher Kimura, Haruka Eigen, Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, Kenta Kobayashi, Takao Omori, Yoshihiro Takayama, Jun Izumida, Masao Inoue, Yoshinari Ogawa, Akira Taue, Jun Akiyama and Mitsuharu Misawa competed in their last matches for All Japan Pro Wrestling at the sold out Hakata Star Lane in Fukuoka. After the show, &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams came out and shook Misawa&#x27;s hand, and requested one last singles match between the two. However, Misawa returned to the bus immediately after his match, not staying for the last two matches of the show. Every one of All Japan&#x27;s titles were vacated due to the departure of the aforementioned wrestlers and title holders. Mrs. Baba appointed Stan Hansen as the new Chairman of All Japan&#x27;s Pacific Wrestling Federation title governing body, replacing Lord James Blears.

=== Interpromotional feud against New Japan (2000–2002) ===
On August 10, 2000, All Japan mainstay Masanobu Fuchi walked into the New Japan Pro-Wrestling ring and declared that his intention was to &quot;break down the walls&quot; between All Japan and New Japan. In response, New Japan foreman Riki Choshu rushed into the ring and exchanged a firm handshake with Fuchi, signaling the beginning of the cross-promotional alliance. On September 16, 2000, Toshiaki Kawada followed Fuchi&#x27;s path and vowed to crush New Japan ace Kensuke Sasaki, as he defeated Sasaki in the Tokyo Dome on October 9, 2000; the event sold out the building. In 2001, Keiji Muto and Shinjiro Otani created the interpromotional stable BATT (Bad Ass Translate Trading), which included All Japan&#x27;s Taiyō Kea, Michinoku Pro&#x27;s Jinsei Shinzaki and Hiroshi Hase. During this time, Muto challenged and defeated Tenryu for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, as well as capturing the World Tag Team Championship with Taiyō Kea. The alliance between the promotions lasted until January 11, 2002.

=== All Japan under Keiji Muto: Pro Wrestling Love era (2002–2013) ===
==== Start of the Pro Wrestling Love era ====

Signs of what would become the Pro Wrestling Love era would be seen in the spring and summer of 2001, when Keiji Muto, as a member of New Japan Pro-Wrestling, made part-time appearances to All Japan, fighting Toshiaki Kawada and &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams in major singles matches on pay-per-view. A notable shift in the product was seen in July 2001, when in a pay-per-view main event, Steve Williams lost to Keiji Muto for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, where it ended in an altercation. After leaving the backstage area Williams would then going on a huge swearing tirade, where he kicked a trash can, was about to cry in tears, and then throwing his armpads to the ground while swearing again.

On January 11, 2002, following the end of a year-long cross-promotional angle with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, Keiji Muto shocked the Japanese wrestling world by defecting to All-Japan as a full-time competitor, taking Satoshi Kojima and Kendo Kashin with him. This is considered the official start of the era. Muto would lose to Steve Williams in a grudge feud in March 2002, but a month later Muto defeated Mike Barton in the 2002 Championship Carnival tournament main-event. Despite Barton&#x27;s loss, he and Jim Steele would find success in winning the Stan Hansen cup in July 2002, Barton also being able to prevent Williams from winning.

==== Company turmoil and sale of All Japan ====

On September 30, 2002, during an All Japan 30th Anniversary party at the famed Tokyo City Hotel, Mrs. Baba officially announced Muto&#x27;s appointment as the new president of All Japan, transferring all of the Baba family stock to him. Mrs. Baba&#x27;s last on-screen appearance was on the October 27, 2002 pay-per-view, before leaving All Japan altogether by January 2003. Muto upheld some traditional aspects of the Baba-run All Japan, as the Champion Carnival and World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League remained annual events.

During this time, All Japan was struggling financially and Muto had to borrow money from Mrs. Baba as of November 28, 2002. This led to rumors that Muto was going to sell the company to Fuji TV by the time of the next WRESTLE-1 pay-per-view, which ultimately did not happen. Instead, shares of All Japan were sold to Gaora TV with the promotion still operating in its usual corporate manner led by Keiji Muto, rarely broadcasting pay-per-views to SKY PerfecTV! and SAMURAI TV. While Muto owned 75% of All Japan&#x27;s shares beginning in 2003 after Mrs. Baba permanently left, the remaining shares went to Gaora TV, who would oversee All Japan&#x27;s production and would buy the majority of the tape library post-2003. They upload several segments of their tape library to their official YouTube channel.

In January 2003, a third exodus began, primarily of gaijin wrestlers. The most notable included &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams, KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark), Bill Goldberg and Mike Rotunda. They had wrestled their last matches on pay-per-views that month, not renewing their contracts after the new ownership fully realized. Williams would only make one more appearance in the Pro Wrestling Love era on a July 22, 2004 pay-per-view, who at the time was going through throat cancer recovery and made a surprise appearance. In April 2003 Johnny Smith also left AJPW, followed by George Hines in July 2003, leaving a void in the gaijin roster. In both of their cases they would defect to IWA Japan, where Williams and Rotunda would also go find work. However, despite his material being shown on IWA TV, Smith&#x27;s planned in-ring debut in March 2004 for IWA Japan never happened due to him choosing to permanently retire because of his aforementioned injury.

==== Creative restructuring after the sale ====
After Mrs. Baba sold the company, gradually over time All Japan took a more sports-entertainment based approach, featuring more in-ring promos, comedy segments, and gimmick matches. This would be controversial among traditional All Japan fans, where All Japan resembled later WCW from both a creative and business stanpoint, but being successful enough to stay in business and not be sold to competing promotions like New Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Noah. The creative shift became most noticeable by the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004.

Throughout 2003 and 2004, recent debuts like John &quot;Earthquake&quot; Tenta, Bull Buchanan, Jamal (Umaga), Taiyō Kea, D&#x27;Lo Brown and Gigantes (Jerry Tuite) would become the main gaijins after the gaijin exodus.

Some interpromotional activities that would not have happened under Shohei Baba&#x27;s watch have taken place, including the previously unfathomable IWGP Heavyweight Champion vs. Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion bout on a New Japan Pro-Wrestling event on February 20, 2005; Satoshi Kojima (who was the Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion) defeated Hiroyoshi Tenzan for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, which made Kojima the only wrestler to ever hold both titles simultaneously to that point. Muto later accomplished the feat in 2008. However, he would hold the IWGP Championship as Keiji Muto, and the Triple Crown Championship as his alter-ego The Great Muta.

In addition, Keiji Muto and Satoshi Kojima are both New Japan Pro-Wrestling alumni but played a consistent role in the main event picture of All Japan Pro Wrestling from the time of their arrival to the promotion, who along with longtime veteran Toshiaki Kawada main-evented All Japan during the mid-2000s.

After John Tenta left All Japan in July 2003 and Jerry Tuite&#x27;s death in December, who often tag-teamed with each other to fight Keiji Muto&#x27;s posse, Jamal (Umaga) and Taiyō Kea would take the roll as the top gaijins in the mid-2000s. They became the main attractions Taka Michinoku&#x27;s Roughly Obsess and Destroy (R.O.D.) stable, being rapidly pushed when they debuted in November 2003. They were a heel stable akin to the early New World Order, trying to take over All Japan and defeat all of the native roster. In February 2004, Taiyō Kea pulled an upset victory against Satoshi Kojima at the February 22, 2004 pay-per-view, while at that show Jamal and D&#x27;Lo Brown lost to Keiji Muto and Bob Sapp. Jamal would later get his revenge on Muto defeating him in the Champion Carnival tournament on the April 15, 2004 edition of AJPW TV.

Jamal feuded with Toshiaki Kawada in pursuit of his Triple Crown Championship in the spring and summer of 2004, but would lose to Kawada on the June 12, 2004 edition of AJPW TV by submission. However, Jamal and Kea continued dominating the tag-team division, where they won several victories. By the end of 2004, Jamal got even with Kawada, where he and Kea eliminated Kawada and Mitsuya Nagai in the Real World Tag League &#x27;04 tournament semifinals. Jamal and Kea would defeat Satoshi Kojima and Kaz Hayashi to win the tournament with the trophies on the December 1, 2004 edition of AJPW TV.

Keiji Muto competed at a Pro Wrestling Noah event on July 10, 2004, teaming with fellow AJPW wrestler Taiyō Kea to face Mitsuharu Misawa and Yoshinari Ogawa. On July 18, 2004, Mitsuharu Misawa returned to All Japan and defeated Satoshi Kojima at &quot;Battle Banquet&quot;. Misawa returned to All Japan again on October 31, 2004, for the &quot;Keiji Muto: Love and Bump&quot; pay-per-view event, where he (along with Keiji Muto) defeated Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki in what was billed as a &quot;Special Dream Tag Match&quot;.

On the January 15, 2005 edition of AJPW TV, Jamal and Taiyō Kea won the vacant AJPW World Tag Team Titles by defeating cult favorite Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yutaka Yoshie. The team of Jamal and Kea won every tag-team title defense throughout 2005, before Jamal left to join the WWE in December 2005, later debuting as Umaga in April 2006.

Taiyō Kea would team with other RO&amp;D stable members throughout 2006 while embarking on a strong singles push. Kea defeated Toshiyaki Kawada for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion on the August 27, 2006 pay-per-view, before losing it to up-and-comer Minoru Suzuki a week later on the September 3, 2006 edition of AJPW TV.

==== Later Pro Wrestling Love era ====

On July 10, 2007, Hiroshi Hase was appointed as the new Chairman of the Pacific Wrestling Federation, following Stan Hansen&#x27;s voluntary resignation. Hase is the third chairman in PWF&#x27;s history. Joe Doering would become the main gaijin around this time.

October 12, 2007 Baseball Magazine Sha, the publisher of Puroresu Shukan released AJPW trading cards.

On June 7, 2011, Keiji Muto announced his resignation as the President of All Japan Pro Wrestling and named Masayuki Uchida as his successor.

On August 28, 2012, AJPW and Gaora TV announced that AJPW would introduce a new championship called the Gaora TV Championship. The tournament for the title began on September 8, and ended on October 7 with Seiya Sanada defeating Yasufumi Nakanoue in the final to become the inaugural champion.

The &quot;Pro Wrestling Love&quot; name and theme was retired on July 5, 2013, thus ending the era.

=== All Japan under Nobuo Shiraishi (2012–2014) ===
On November 1, 2012, IT company Speed Partners purchased all shares of All Japan from Keiji Muto and his business partners like Gaora TV for ¥200 million, however, the purchase was not made public until February 2013. In January 2013, AJPW signed Atsushi Aoki, Go Shiozaki, Jun Akiyama, Kotaro Suzuki and Yoshinobu Kanemaru, all of whom had quit Pro Wrestling Noah the previous month, to return to AJPW, initially as freelancers. On March 17, 2013, it was announced that Hiroshi Hase was stepping down as Pacific Wrestling Federation Chairman, and that he would be succeeded by Kenta Kobashi, following Kobashi&#x27;s retirement as a professional wrestler on May 11, 2013.

==== Fourth exodus: Wrestle-1 ====
On May 1, 2013, it was reported that negotiations had started between Speed Partners president Nobuo Shiraishi and All Japan president Masayuki Uchida, which would see Keiji Muto regain the promotion&#x27;s presidency before the end of the month. However, on May 27, it was reported that Shiraishi himself would take over the presidency of All Japan effective June 1. This was later confirmed by All Japan, and led to Keiji Muto&#x27;s resignation from the promotion. In the weeks that followed, Masakatsu Funaki, Kaz Hayashi, Shuji Kondo, Ryota Hama, Masayuki Kono, Hiroshi Yamato, Koji Kanemoto, Minoru Tanaka, Yasufumi Nakanoue, Kai, Seiya Sanada and Andy Wu announced their resignation from the promotion out of loyalty to Muto.

They all left the promotion following a June 30 event in Ryōgoku Kokugikan (the TV taping for the July 5 episode where the Pro Wrestling Love era ended) and went on to form the Wrestle-1 promotion the following month and announced their first show was held September 8 at Tokyo Dome City Hall. At the event, the Gaora TV Champion René Dupree made his debut in Wrestle-1, leaving AJPW. Before the end of the year, Manabu Soya also quit All Japan to jump to Wrestle-1.

==== Rebuilding ====
After the exodus (along with the departures of ring announcer Makoto Abe and referees Daichi Murayama and Daisuke Kanbayashi), the promotion has now been reduced to less than half the active roster. On June 21, 2013, it was revealed that since 2009, AJPW mainstay Masanobu Fuchi, who has been with the promotion since debuting in 1974, had long since resigned from the AJPW Board of Directors and has not been on an exclusive contract due to his age, thus becoming a freelancer, but chose to stay with AJPW on a pay per performance basis. On July 5, 2013, all five members of Burning (Akiyama, Shiozaki, Aoki, Suzuki, and Kanemaru) officially signed exclusive contracts with AJPW, ending their tenure as freelancers, along with the returns of Taiyo Kea and referee Kyohei Wada. On July 14, during the launching event of the post-Muto All Japan, Masanobu Fuchi announced that he had officially re-signed with the promotion not only as a wrestler, but also as a member of the Board of Directors, ending his tenure as a freelancer. On August 1, all of the All Japan shares were moved from Speed Partners to Shiraishi&#x27;s Red Wall Japan corporation, which effectively became the new parent company of the promotion. Meanwhile, the promotion&#x27;s corporate name was changed to &quot;Zen Nihon Puroresu Systems&quot;. On August 7, it was reported that All Japan had agreed to return the NWA International Heavyweight, NWA United National and PWF World Heavyweight Championship belts, which make up the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, to Motoko Baba, the widow of the promotion&#x27;s founder Giant Baba, bringing an end to the final remnant of the Giant Baba All Japan. The Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship retained its old name, but All Japan introduced a new title belt to represent it. The three original belts were defended for the last time on August 25, when Suwama successfully defended them against Go Shiozaki. The new title belt was revealed on October 27. On August 27, Shiraishi announced that he would be stepping down as the All Japan president by the end of the month. He would, however, remain the owner of the promotion. On September 1, longtime freelancer Akebono signed a contract to officially join All Japan full-time. On September 11, Hirota Inoue, one of the executive directors originally brought to the promotion by Shiraishi, was announced as the new president of All Japan. On October 27, Dory Funk, Jr. was announced as the new Pacific Wrestling Federation chairman.

=== All Japan under Jun Akiyama (2014–2020) ===
On June 5, 2014, All Japan announced a corporate restructuring taking place on July 1, which would see Jun Akiyama take over as the promotion&#x27;s new president. On July 1, the promotion announced another corporate name change to &quot;All Japan Pro Wrestling kabushiki gaisha&quot; (dropping the Japanese &quot;Zen Nihon Puroresu&quot; name), while also relocating its headquarters from Tokyo to Yokohama. Akiyama established a new company named Zen Nihon Puroresu Innovation, through which he will run the new All Japan Pro Wrestling. Akiyama also serves as the representative director of the promotion and reports to a board of directors, which most notably includes Suwama and Akebono. Motoko Baba also joined the promotion as a consultant. On September 28, 2015, Go Shiozaki announced his resignation from All Japan. On November 2, it was announced that Akebono was also leaving All Japan with the goal of returning to mixed martial arts. On November 16, yet another wrestler, the reigning World Junior Heavyweight Champion Kotaro Suzuki, announced his departure from All Japan at the end of the month. Four days later, Yoshinobu Kanemaru also announced he would be leaving All Japan following December 15. Akiyama revealed that the departures were all for the same reason: All Japan had recently decided to change all of its wrestler contracts to pay-per-appearance contracts. In October 2016, the promotion announced it had reached a deal with satellite television provider Nippon BS Broadcasting for a monthly highlights show, &quot;Eleven&quot;, to be broadcast on the third Monday of each month. On November 27, 2016, the promotion returned to Ryōgoku Kokugikan for its first event at the venue in three years, headlined by Kento Miyahara defending the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship against Suwama. In August 2017 Toryumon Mexico started working with All Japan Pro Wrestling in with a collaborated event tour called Lucha Fiesta. On February 4, 2018, AJPW announced &quot;All Japan Pro Wrestling TV&quot;, a new worldwide streaming site for the promotion&#x27;s events. On October 10, 2019, Akiyama left his position as president to become General Manager. Tsuyoki Fukuda was later made president of AJPW.

=== All Japan under Tsuyoki Fukuda (2020–present)===
On April 2, 2020, AJPW president Tsuyoki Fukuda decided to cancel the 2020 Champion Carnival in April, with the tournament being rescheduled for a later date and three opening shows of the Super Power Series 2020 tour would also be canceled following that the promotion would start to do empty arenas shows at 2AW&#x27;s 2AW Square arena. On June 26, AJPW General Manager Jun Akiyama announced that he would leave AJPW for DDT after nine years with the promotion and announced that management of the promotion would be transferred to Tsuyoki Fukuda. On November 14, AJPW announced the creation of its sixth active title and the first six-man tag team championship in the promotion&#x27;s history, the AJPW TV Six-Man Tag Team Championship. On November 28, the board of directors Suwama announced the launching of AJPW&#x27;s own women&#x27;s division &quot;Evolution&#x27;s Girls&quot;. Suwama announced that he would be heading the division alongside Shuji Ishikawa, intending to recruit and hopes to train women wrestlers for the promotion. In April, during an interview with Tokyo Sports, Suwama expressed his intention to establish a women&#x27;s division, however, his plans were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Afterwards, AJPW also established a working relationship with Joshi promotion Ice Ribbon, during which Tsukasa Fujimoto was announced as an advisor for the new division.

On May 7, 2021, the Japanese government announced an extension to the state of emergency currently in place in Tokyo and other prefectures, leading AJPW to postpone their event on May 15 at Ota City General Gymnasium to June 26. On June 26, it was announced since the creation of the Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion that the title would be decided in a Tomoe Battle, where in cooperation with the Baba family, Jake Lee would bring the NWA International Heavyweight Championship, Kento Miyahara the PWF World Heavyweight Championship and Yuma Aoyagi the NWA United National Championship to symbolize the origin of the title belt. This kind of match was last fought at the 1997 Champion Carnival where Toshiaki Kawada defeated Mitsuharu Misawa and Kenta Kobashi to win the tournament, the match usually starts with consecutive singles matches between three wrestlers, which wrestler who have two wins in a row first is declared the winner. On October 18, 2021, Zeus announced his resignation from All Japan after he had purchased all shares of Osaka Pro Wrestling from Yuji Sakagami announcing that he would be leaving the promotion on December 31 when his contract expires. Zeus himself expressed interest in a future collaboration between AJPW and Osaka Pro, with whom Zeus previously worked in the past which would also lead to more departures with Naoya Nomura and Koji Iwamoto announcing on December 5, that he would also be leaving the promotion on December 31 when their contract expires only to Nomura return to the promotion in June 2022. On July 12, 2022, it was announced that AJPW would be celebrating its 50th anniversary event on September 18, 2022, at the Nippon Budokan, marking the return of the promotion to the arena for the first time in eighteen years.

On December 15, 2023, AJPW was announced as one of the founding members of the United Japan Pro-Wrestling alliance, a joint effort to further develop professional wrestling in Japan through promotion and organization, with Seiji Sakaguchi being named as the chairman of the project.

<text>The Sheraton Waikiki Beach Resort is a resort hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii on Waikiki. It was built in 1971 and is currently owned by Kyo-Ya Management Company, Ltd. and operated by Marriott International. The hotel was featured in The Brady Bunch season 4 opener in 1972.

== Ownership ==

In 1974, Japanese brothers Kenji Osano and Masakuni Osano bought the 3 year-old Sheraton Waikiki Hotel, along with the Sheraton Maui and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. They already owned the Princess Kaiulani Hotel, the Moana Hotel and the Surfrider Hotel. The Osano brothers formed Kyo-Ya Company Limited, a subsidiary of Kokusai Kogyo Company Limited as the corporate entity charged with overseeing the hotel properties. The purchases put the Osano brothers on the Forbes List of World&#x27;s Richest People in 1999. After the death of the Osano brothers, Takamasa Osano inherited the billions of dollars owned in properties. The Sheraton Waikiki Hotel is used as the Osano corporate office. In 2004 Takamasa Osano sold 65% of Kokusai Kogyo to Cerberus Partners LP to cover $4 billion in defaulted loans. He still controls 35% of the company.

== Labor relations ==

On November 12, 2024, workers at the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel ratified a new labor contract.
