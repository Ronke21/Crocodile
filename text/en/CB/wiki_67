<text>Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores. The conversion of copper ores consists of a series of physical, chemical, and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.

==History==

The Old Copper Complex in North America has been radiometrically dated to 9500 BP—i.e., about 7480 BCE—making it one of the oldest known examples of copper extraction in the world. The earliest evidence of the cold-hammering of native copper comes from the excavation at Çayönü Tepesi in eastern Anatolia, which dates between 7200 and 6600 BCE. Among the various items considered to be votive or amulets, there was one that looked like a fishhook and one like an awl. Another find, at Shanidar Cave in Mergasur, Iraq, contained copper beads, and dates back to 8,700 BCE.

One of the world&#x27;s oldest known copper mines, as opposed to usage of surface deposits, is at Timna Valley, Israel, and has been used since the fourth millennium BC, with surface deposit usage occurring in the fifth and sixth millennium.

The Pločnik archaeological site in southeastern Europe (Serbia) contains the oldest securely dated evidence of copper making at high temperature, from 5,000 BCE. The find in June 2010 extends for an additional 500 years, dated to 5th millennium BCE, representing the earlier record of copper smelting from Rudna Glava (Serbia).

Copper smelting technology gave rise to the Copper Age, aka Chalcolithic Age, and then the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age would not have been possible without the development of smelting technology.

The introduction of reverberatory furnaces to Chile around 1830 by Charles Saint Lambert revolutionized Chilean copper mining. To this came the improvements of transport caused by the development of railroads and steam navigation. Prospector José Tomás Urmeneta discovered the mineral of Tamaya in 1850 which became one of Chile&#x27;s main copper mines. All this made Chile supply 18% of the copper produced worldwide in the 19th century and the country was from the 1850s to the 1870s the world&#x27;s top producer. In some years Chile&#x27;s copper production made up about 60% of the worlds output and its export tariff made up more than half the state&#x27;s income.

By the late 19th century the Chilean mining industry once again lagged behind technological developments (e.g. flotation, leaching, large-scale open-pit mining) contributing to the drop of its share of the world production to 5–6% in the 1890s and similar shares remained in the 1900s and 1910s reaching a low of 4.3% in 1914. Up to the 1940s and 1950s there was also a notable lack a major exploration efforts by large mining companies that relied on purchasing prospects already known from small-scale miners and pirquineros.

===Smelting===

Until the latter half of the 20th century, smelting sulfide ores was almost the sole means of producing copper metal from mined ores (&quot;primary&quot; copper production). As of 2002, 80% of global primary copper production was from copper–iron–sulfur minerals, and the vast majority of these were treated by smelting.

Copper was initially recovered from sulfide ores by directly smelting the ore in a furnace. The smelters were initially located near the mines to minimize the cost of transport. This avoided the prohibitive costs of transporting the waste minerals and the sulfur and iron present in the copper-containing minerals. However, as the concentration of copper in the ore bodies decreased, the energy costs of smelting the whole ore also became prohibitive, and it became necessary to concentrate the ores first.

Initial concentration techniques included hand-sorting and gravity concentration. These resulted in high losses of copper. Consequently, the development of the froth flotation process was a major step forward in mineral processing. The modern froth flotation process was independently invented in the early 1900s in Australia by C.V Potter and around the same time by G. D. Delprat. It made the development of the giant Bingham Canyon mine in Utah possible.

In the twentieth century, most ores were concentrated before smelting. Smelting was initially undertaken using sinter plants and blast furnaces, or with roasters and reverberatory furnaces. Roasting and reverberatory furnace smelting dominated primary copper production until the 1960s.

===Late 20th century trends===
In the 1960s and 1970s large copper mining operations by U.S. companies were nationalized in many of the main copper producing countries. Thus by the 1980s state owned enterpises overtook the dominant role U.S. companies like Anaconda Copper and Kennecott had had until then. In the late 1970s and early 1980s various oil companies like ARCO, Exxon (Exxon Minerals) and Standard Oil Company expanded into copper mining for a few years before selling their copper assets. Reportedly gains were not as high as anticipated. Investments in copper mining concentrated in Chile in the 1980s and 1990s given that copper mining in other countries faced problems like political instability (Peru), increased environmental requirements (developed countries) or overall disinterest in foreign investment in a nationalized mining industry (Zaire, Zambia).

==Concentration (beneficiation)==


The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. Thus, all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated). The concentrate is typically sold to distant smelters, although some large mines have smelters located nearby. Such colocation of mines and smelters was more typical in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when smaller smelters could be economic. The subsequent processing techniques depend on the nature of the ore.

In the usual case when it is primarily sulfide copper minerals (such as chalcopyrite, FeCuS2), the ore is treated by &quot;comminution&quot;, where the rock is crushed to produce small particles (&lt;100 μm) consisting of individual mineral phases. These particles are then ready to be separated to remove gangue (silicate rocks residues) using froth flotation.

===Froth flotation===

In froth flotation, the crushed ore is wetted, suspended in a slurry, and mixed with reagents that render the sulfide particles hydrophobic. Typical reagents (&quot;collectors&quot;) include potassium ethylxanthate and sodium ethylxanthate, but dithiophosphates and dithiocarbamates are also used. The slurry is introduced to a water-filled aeration tank containing a surfactant such as methylisobutyl carbinol (MIBC). Air is constantly forced through the slurry. The air bubbles attach to the hydrophobic copper sulfide particles, which are conveyed to the surface where the froth is skimmed off. These skimmings are generally subjected to a cleaner-scavenger cell to remove excess silicates and to remove other sulfide minerals that can deleteriously impact the concentrate quality (typically, galena), and the final concentrate is sent for smelting. The rock that has not floated off in the flotation cell is either discarded as tailings or further processed to extract other metals such as lead (from galena) and zinc (from sphalerite), should they exist. A variety of measures are taken to improve the efficiency of the froth flotation. Lime is used to raise the pH of the water bath, causing the collector to bond more efficiently to the copper sulfides. The process can produce concentrates with 27–29% and 37–40% copper contents from chalcopyrite and chalcocite, respectively.

===Hydrometallurgy===
Oxidised copper ores include carbonates such as azurite and malachite, the silicate chrysocolla, and sulfates such as atacamite. In some cases, sulfide ores are allowed to degrade to oxides. Such ores are amenable to hydrometallurgy. Specifically, such oxide ores are usually extracted into aqueous sulfuric acid, usually in a heap leaching or dump leaching. The resulting pregnant leach solution is purified by solvent extraction (SX). It is treated with an organic solvent and an organic chelators. The chelators bind the copper ions (and no other ions, ideally), the resulting complexes dissolve in the organic phase. This organic solvent is evaporated, leaving a residue of the copper complexes. The copper ions are liberated from the residue with sulfuric acid. The barred (denuded) sulfuric acid recycled back on to the heaps. The organic ligands are recovered and recycled as well. Alternatively, the copper can be precipitated out of the pregnant solution by contacting it with scrap iron; a process called cementation. Cement copper is normally less pure than SX-EW copper.

===Specialized ores===

Secondary sulfides—those formed by supergene secondary enrichment—are resistant (&quot;refractory&quot;) to sulfuric leaching. Secondary copper sulfides are dominated by the mineral chalcocite; a mineral formed from primary sulfides, like chalcopyrite, that undergo chemical processes such as oxidation or reduction. Typically, secondary sulfide ores are concentrated using froth flotation. Other extraction processes like leaching are effectively used for the extraction of secondary copper sulfides, but as demand for copper rises, extraction processes tailored for low-grade ores are required, due to the depletion of copper resources. Processes including in situ, dump, and heap leaching are cost-effective methods that are suitable for extracting copper from low-grade ores.

Extraction processes for secondary copper sulfides and low-grade ores includes the process of heap bioleaching. Heap bioleaching presents a cost efficient extraction method that requires a less intensive energy input resulting in a higher profit. This extraction process can be applied to large quantities of low-grade ores, at a lower capital cost with minimal environmental impact.

Generally, direct froth flotation is not used to concentrate copper oxide ores, as a result of the largely ionic and hydrophilic structure of the copper oxide mineral surface. Copper oxide ores are typically treated via chelating-reagent flotation and fatty-acid flotation, which use organic reagents to ensure adsorption onto the mineral surface through the formation of hydrophobic compounds on the mineral surface.

Some supergene sulfide deposits can be leached using a bacterial oxidation heap leach process to oxidize the sulfides to sulfuric acid, which also allows for simultaneous leaching with sulfuric acid to produce a copper sulfate solution. For oxide ores, solvent extraction and electrowinning technologies are used to recover the copper from the pregnant leach solution. To ensure the best recovery of copper, it is important to acknowledge the effect copper dissolution, acid consumption, and gangue mineral composition has on the efficacy of extraction.

Supergene sulfide ores rich in native copper are refractory to treatment with sulfuric acid leaching on all practicable time scales, and the dense metal particles do not react with froth flotation media. Typically, if native copper is a minor part of a supergene profile it will not be recovered and will report to the tailings. When rich enough, native copper ore bodies may be treated to recover the contained copper by gravity separation. Often, the nature of the gangue is important, as clay-rich native copper ores prove difficult to liberate. This is because clay minerals interact with flotation reagents used in extraction processes, that are then consumed, which results in minimal recovery of a high grade copper concentrate.

==Roasting==

The roasting process is generally undertaken in combination with reverberatory furnaces. In the roaster, the copper concentrate is partially oxidised to produce &quot;calcine&quot;. Sulfur dioxide is liberated. The stoichiometry of the reaction is:

Roasting generally leaves more sulfur in the calcined product (15% in the case of the roaster at Mount Isa Mines) than a sinter plant leaves in the sintered product (about 7% in the case of the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting smelter).

As of 2005, roasting is no longer common in copper concentrate treatment because its combination with reverberatory furnaces is not energy efficient and the SO2 concentration in the roaster offgas is too dilute for cost-effective capture. Direct smelting is now favored, and uses the following smelting technologies: flash smelting, Isasmelt, Noranda, Mitsubishi or El Teniente furnaces.

===Smelting===
The initial melting of the material to be smelted is usually referred to as the &quot;smelting&quot; or &quot;matte smelting&quot; stage. It can be undertaken in a variety of furnaces, including the largely obsolete blast furnaces and reverberatory furnaces, as well as flash furnaces, Isasmelt furnaces, etc. The product of this smelting stage is a mixture of copper, iron and sulfur that is enriched in copper, which is called &quot;matte&quot; or &quot;copper matte&quot;. The term &quot;matte grade&quot; is normally used to refer to the copper content of the matte.

The purpose of the matte smelting stage is to eliminate as much of the unwanted iron, sulfur and &quot;gangue&quot; minerals (such as silica, magnesia, alumina and limestone) as possible, while minimizing the loss of copper. This is achieved by reacting iron sulfides with oxygen (in air or oxygen enriched air) to produce iron oxides (mainly as FeO, but with some magnetite (Fe3O4)) and sulfur dioxide.

Copper sulfide and iron oxide can mix, but when sufficient silica is added, a separate slag layer is formed. Adding silica also reduces the melting point (or, more properly, the liquidus temperature) of the slag, meaning that the smelting process can be operated at a lower temperature.

The slag forming reaction is:

:FeO + SiO2 → FeO.SiO2

Slag is less dense than matte, so it forms a layer that floats on top of the matte.

Copper can be lost from the matte in three ways: as cuprous oxide (Cu2O) dissolved in the slag, as sulfide copper dissolved in the slag or as tiny droplets (or &quot;prills&quot;) of matte suspended in the slag.

The amount of copper lost as oxide copper increases as the oxygen potential of the slag increases. The oxygen potential generally increases as the copper content of the matte is increased. Thus, the loss of copper as oxide increases as the copper content of the matte increases.

On the other hand, the solubility of sulfidic copper in slag decreases as the copper content of the matte increases beyond about 40%. Nagamori calculated that more than half the copper dissolved in slags from mattes containing less than 50% copper is sulfidic copper. Above this figure, oxidic copper begins to dominate.

The loss of copper as prills suspended in the slag depends on the size of the prills, the viscosity of the slag and the settling time available. Rosenqvist suggested that about half the copper losses to slag were due to suspended prills.

The mass of slag generated in the smelting stage depends on the iron content of the material fed into the smelting furnace and the target matte grade. The greater the iron content of the feed, the more iron that will need to be rejected to the slag for a given matte grade. Similarly, increasing the target matte grade requires the rejection of more iron and an increase in the slag volume.

Thus, the two factors that most affect the loss of copper to slag in the smelting stage are:
* matte grade
* mass of slag.

This means that there is a practical limit on how high the matte grade can be if the loss of copper to slag is to be minimized. Therefore, further stages of processing (converting and fire refining) are required.

The following subsections briefly describe some of the processes used in matte smelting.

====Reverberatory furnace smelting====

Reverberatory furnaces are long furnaces that can treat wet, dry, or roasted concentrate. Most of the reverberatory furnaces used in the latter years treated roasted concentrate because putting dry feed materials into the reverberatory furnace is more energy efficient, and because the elimination of some of the sulfur in the roaster results in higher matte grades.

The reverberatory furnace feed is added to the furnace through feed holes along the sides of the furnace, and the solid charge is melted. Additional silica is normally added to help form the slag. The furnace is fired with burners using pulverized coal, fuel oil or natural gas.

Reverberatory furnaces can additionally be fed with molten slag from the later converting stage to recover the contained copper and other materials with a high copper content.

Because the reverberatory furnace bath is quiescent, very little oxidation of the feed occurs (and thus very little sulfur is eliminated from the concentrate). It is essentially a melting process. Consequently, wet-charged reverberatory furnaces have less copper in their matte product than calcine-charged furnaces, and they also have lower copper losses to slag. Gill quotes a copper in slag value of 0.23% for a wet-charged reverberatory furnace vs 0.37% for a calcine-charged furnace.

In the case of calcine-charged furnaces, a significant portion of the sulfur has been eliminated during the roasting stage, and the calcine consists of a mixture of copper and iron oxides and sulfides. The reverberatory furnace acts to allow these species to approach chemical equilibrium at the furnace operating temperature (approximately 1600 °C at the burner end of the furnace and about 1200 °C at the flue end; the matte is about 1100 °C and the slag is about 1195 °C). In this equilibration process, oxygen associated with copper compounds exchanges with sulfur associated with iron compounds, increasing the iron oxide content of the furnace, and the iron oxides interact with silica and other oxide materials to form the slag.

The main equilibration reaction is:

:Cu2O + FeS → Cu2S + FeO

The slag and the matte form distinct layers that can be removed from the furnace as separate streams. The slag layer is periodically allowed to flow through a hole in the wall of the furnace above the height of the matte layer. The matte is removed by draining it through a hole into ladles for it to be carried by crane to the converters. This draining process is known as &quot;tapping&quot; the furnace. The matte taphole is normally a hole through a water-cooled copper block that prevents erosion of the refractory bricks lining the furnace. When the removal of the matte or slag is complete, the hole is normally plugged with clay, which is removed when the furnace is ready to be tapped again.

Reverberatory furnaces were often used to treat molten converter slag to recover contained copper. This would be poured into the furnaces from ladles carried by cranes. However, the converter slag is high in magnetite and some of this magnetite would precipitate from the converter slag (due to its higher melting point), forming an accretion on the hearth of the reverberatory furnace and necessitating shut downs of the furnace to remove the accretion. This accretion formation limits the quantity of converter slag that can be treated in a reverberatory furnace.

While reverberatory furnaces have very low copper losses to slag, they are not very energy-efficient and the low concentrations of sulfur dioxide in their off-gases make its capture uneconomic. Consequently, smelter operators devoted a lot of money in the 1970s and 1980s to developing new, more efficient copper smelting processes. In addition, flash smelting technologies had been developed in earlier years and began to replace reverberatory furnaces. By 2002, 20 of the 30 reverberatory furnaces still operating in 1994 had been shut down.

====Flash furnace smelting====

In flash smelting, the concentrate is dispersed in an air or oxygen stream and the smelting reactions are largely completed while the mineral particles are still in flight. The reacted particles then settle in a bath at the bottom of the furnace, where they behave like calcine in a reverberatory furnace. A slag layer forms on top of the matte layer, and they can separately be tapped from the furnace.

====ISASMELT====
===Converting===

The matte, which is produced in the smelter, contains 30–70% copper (depending on the process used and the operating philosophy of the smelter), primarily as copper sulfide, as well as iron sulfide. The sulfur is removed at a high temperature as sulfur dioxide by blowing air through molten matte:
:2 CuS + 3 O2 → 2 CuO + 2 SO2

:CuS + O2 → Cu + SO2

In a parallel reaction the iron sulfide is converted to slag:

:2 FeS + 3 O2 → 2 FeO + 2 SO2
:2 FeO + SiO2 → Fe2SiO4

The purity of this product is 98%, it is known as &quot;blister&quot; because of the broken surface created by the escape of sulfur dioxide gas as blister copper &quot;pigs&quot; or ingots are cooled. By-products generated in the process are sulfur dioxide and slag. The sulfur dioxide is captured and converted to sulfuric acid and either sold on the open market or used in copper leaching processes.

==Refining==
===Fire refining===

The blister copper is put into an anode furnace, a furnace that refines the blister copper to anode-grade copper in two stages by removing most of the remaining sulfur and iron, and then removing oxygen introduced during the first stage. This second stage, often referred to as &quot;poling&quot; is done by blowing natural gas, or some other reducing agent, through the molten copper oxide. When this flame burns green, indicating the copper oxidation spectrum, the oxygen has mostly been burned off. This creates copper at about 99% pure.

===Electrolysis===
The final stage in the production of copper is refining. Refining is achieved by electrolysis, which exploits the easy (low potential) and selective conversion of copper(II) solutions to the metal. The anodes cast from processed blister copper are placed into an aqueous solution of 3–4% copper sulfate and 10–16% sulfuric acid. Cathodes are thin rolled sheets of highly pure copper or, more commonly these days, reusable stainless steel starting sheets (as in the IsaKidd process). A potential of only 0.2–0.4 volts is required for the process to commence. In industrial plants current densities up to 420 A/m2 are possible.

At the anode (oxidation reaction), copper and less noble metals dissolve. More noble metals and less soluble elements such as silver, gold, selenium, and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode slime, which forms a salable by-product. Copper(II) ions migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode. At the cathode (reduction reaction), ions are reduced in copper metal and Cu(s) plates out, but less noble constituents such as arsenic and zinc remain in solution unless a higher voltage is used.

The reactions involving metallic copper and ions at the electrodes are the following:

==Concentrate and copper marketing==

Copper concentrates produced by mines are sold to smelters and refiners who treat the ore and refine the copper and charge for this service via treatment charges (TCs) and refining charges (RCs). The TCs are charged in US$ per tonne of concentrate treated and RCs are charged in cents per pound treated, denominated in US dollars, with benchmark prices set annually by major Japanese smelters. The customer in this case can be a smelter, who on-sells blister copper ingots to a refiner, or a smelter-refiner which is vertically integrated.

One prevalent form of copper concentrate contains gold and silver, like the one produced by Bougainville Copper Limited from the Panguna mine from the early 1970s to the late 1980s.

The typical contract for a miner is denominated against the London Metal Exchange price, minus the TC-RCs and any applicable penalties or credits. Penalties may be assessed against copper concentrates according to the level of deleterious elements such as arsenic, bismuth, lead or tungsten. Because a large portion of copper sulfide ore bodies contain silver or gold in appreciable amounts, a credit can be paid to the miner for these metals if their concentration &quot;within the concentrate&quot; is above a certain amount. Usually the refiner or smelter charges the miner a fee based on the concentration; a typical contract will specify that a credit is due for every ounce of the metal in the concentrate above a certain concentration; below that, if it is recovered, the smelter will keep the metal and sell it to defray costs.

Copper concentrate is traded either via spot contracts or under long term contracts as an intermediate product in its own right. Often the smelter sells the copper metal itself on behalf of the miner. The miner is paid the price at the time that the smelter-refiner makes the sale, not at the price on the date of delivery of the concentrate. Under a Quotational Pricing system, the price is agreed to be at a fixed date in the future, typically 90 days from time of delivery to the smelter.

A-grade copper cathode is of 99.99% copper in sheets that are approximately 1 meter square; thickness and weight depend on manufacturer. Typical 1 cm thick sheet weighs approximately 200 pounds (about 90 kg). It is a true commodity, deliverable to and tradeable upon the metal exchanges in New York City (COMEX), London (London Metals Exchange) and Shanghai (Shanghai Futures Exchange). Often copper cathode is traded upon the exchanges indirectly via warrants, options, or swap contracts such that the majority of copper is traded upon the LME/COMEX/SFE, but delivery is achieved directly, logistically moving the physical copper, and transferring the copper sheet from the physical warehouses themselves.

The chemical specification for electrolytic grade copper is ASTM B 115-00 (a standard that specifies the purity and maximum electrical resistivity of the product).

==Peak copper==
Peak copper is the point in time at which the maximum global copper production rate is reached. Since copper is a finite resource, at some point in the future new production from mining will diminish, and at some earlier time production will reach a maximum. When this will occur is a matter of dispute. Unlike fossil fuels, copper is scrapped and reused, and it has been estimated that at least 80% of all copper ever mined is still available (having been repeatedly recycled).

Copper is among the most important industrial metals, ranking third after iron and aluminium in terms of quantity used. It is valued for its heat and electrical conductivities, ductility, malleability and resistance to corrosion. Electrical uses account for about three quarters of total copper consumption, including power cables, data cables and electrical equipment. It is also used in cooling and refrigeration tubing, heat exchangers, water pipes and consumer products.

Copper has been used by humans for at least 10,000 years. More than 97% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900. The increased demand for copper due to the growing Indian and Chinese economies since 2006 has led to increased prices and an increase in copper theft.

===History===
Concern about the copper supply is not new. In 1924 geologist and copper-mining expert Ira Joralemon warned:
:... the age of electricity and of copper will be short. At the intense rate of production that must come, the copper supply of the world will last hardly a score of years. ... Our civilization based on electrical power will dwindle and die.

===Copper supply===

Globally, economic copper resources are being depleted with the equivalent production of three world-class copper mines being consumed annually. Environmental analyst Lester Brown suggested in 2008 that copper might run out within 25 years based on what he considered a reasonable extrapolation of 2% growth per year.

====New copper discoveries====
Fifty-six new copper discoveries have been made during the three decades 1975–2005. World discoveries of new copper deposits are said to have peaked in 1996. However, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), remaining world copper reserves have more than doubled since then, from 310 million metric tons in 1996 to 890 million metric tons in 2022.

====Production====

As shown in the table below, the three chief national producers of copper, respectively, in 2002, were Chile, Indonesia, and the United States. In 2013, they were Chile, China, and Peru. Twenty-one of the 28 largest copper mines in the world (as of 2006) are not amenable to expansion.

====Reserves====
Copper is a fairly common element, with an estimated concentration of 50–70 ppm (0.005–0.007 percent) in Earth&#x27;s crust (1 kg of copper per 15–20 tons of crustal rock). A concentration of 60 ppm would multiply out to 1.66 quadrillion tonnes over the mass of the crust, or over 90 million years&#x27; worth at the 2013 production rate of 18.3 MT per year. However, not all of it can be extracted profitably at the current level of technology and the current market value.

The USGS reported a current total reserve base of copper in potentially recoverable ores of 1.6 billion tonnes as of 2005, of which 950 million tonnes were considered economically recoverable. A 2013 global assessment identified &quot;455 known deposits (with well-defined identified resources) that contain about 1.8 billion metric tons of copper&quot;, and predicted &quot;a mean of 812 undiscovered deposits within the uppermost kilometer of the earth&#x27;s surface&quot; containing another 3.1 billion metric tons of copper &quot;which represents about 180 times 2012 global copper production from all types of copper deposits.&quot;

====Known resources====
=====Recycling=====
In the US, more copper is recovered and put back into service from recycled material than is derived from newly mined ore. Copper&#x27;s recycle value is so great that premium-grade scrap normally has at least 95% of the value of primary metal from newly mined ore. In Europe, about 50% of copper demand comes from recycling (as of 2016).

, recycled copper provided 32% of total worldwide copper usage.

=====Undiscovered conventional resources=====
Based on discovery rates and existing geologic surveys, researchers estimated in 2006 that 1.6 billion metric tons of copper could be brought into use. This figure relied on the broadest possible definition of available copper as well as a lack of energy constraints and environmental concerns.

The US Geological Survey estimated that, as of 2013, there remained 3.5 billion metric tons of undiscovered copper resources worldwide in porphyry and sediment-hosted type deposits, two types which currently provide 80% of mined copper production. This was in addition to 2.1 billion metric tons of identified resources. Combined identified and estimated undiscovered copper resources were 5.6 billion metric tons, 306 times the 2013 global production of newly mined copper of 18.3 million metric tons.

=====Unconventional resources=====
Deep-sea nodules are estimated to contain 700 million tonnes of copper.

===Criticism===
Julian Simon was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a professor of business and economics. In his book &quot;The Ultimate Resource 2&quot; (first printed in 1981 and reprinted in 1998), he extensively criticizes the notion of &quot;peak resources&quot;, and uses copper as one example. He argues that, even though &quot;peak copper&quot; has been a persistent scare since the early 20th century, &quot;known reserves&quot; grew at a rate that outpaced demand, and the price of copper was not rising but falling over the long run. For example, even though world production of copper in 1950 was only one-eighth of what it was in the early 2000s, known reserves were also much lower at the time – around 100 million metric tons – making it appear that the world would run out of copper in 40 to 50 years at most.

Simon&#x27;s own explanation for this development is that the very notion of known reserves is deeply flawed, as it does not take into account changes in mining profitability. As richer mines are exhausted, developers turn their attention to poorer sources of the element and eventually develop cheap methods of extracting it, raising known reserves. Thus, for example, copper was so abundant 5000 years ago, occurring in pure form as well as in highly concentrated copper ores, that prehistoric peoples were able to collect and process it with very basic technology. As of the early 21st century, copper is commonly mined from ores that contain 0.3–0.6% copper by weight. Yet, despite the material being far less widespread, the cost of, for example, a copper pot was vastly lower in the late 20th century than 5000 years ago.

<text>The Confederate States Marine Corps (CSMC), also referred to as the Confederate States Marines, was a branch of the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. It was established by an act of the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States on March 16, 1861. The Corps&#x27; manpower was initially authorized at 46 officers and 944 enlisted men, and was increased on September 24, 1862, to 1,026 enlisted men. The organization of the Corps began at Montgomery, Alabama, and was completed at Richmond, Virginia, when the capital of the Confederate States was moved to that location. The headquarters and main training facilities remained in Richmond throughout the war, located at Camp Beall on Drewry&#x27;s Bluff and at the Gosport Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. The last Marine unit surrendered to the Union army on April 9, 1865, with the Confederacy itself capitulating a month later.

==Modeled after USMC==

Before the war, the United States Marine Corps had been an &quot;exceptionally fine and well-disciplined&quot; organization, and &quot;from it came the nucleus of the corresponding establishment of the Confederate service&quot;, the CSMC. The CSMC was modeled after the United States Marine Corps, but there were some differences: the Confederates organized themselves into permanent companies, replaced the fife with the light infantry bugle, and wore uniforms similar to those of British Royal Marines. Like the USMC, when ashore they provided guard detachments for Confederate naval stations at:
*Richmond, Virginia
*Camp Beall, located near Fort Darling at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, Virginia
*Wilmington, North Carolina – Fort Fisher
*Charlotte, North Carolina
*Charleston, South Carolina
*Hilton Head Island, South Carolina
*Savannah, Georgia
*Pensacola, Florida – (manned naval shore batteries)
*Mobile, Alabama

Seagoing detachments served aboard the various warships and even on commerce destroyers.

==Organization==
The C.S. Marine Corps was formed in the early days of the Civil War from three sources:

* Sixteen officers (resigning or deserting from the U.S. Marine Corps)
* 100 enlisted men
* The amalgamation of state organizations such as the Virginia State Marines
* Active recruitment

===Source of men===

The Colonel-Commandant of the CSMC, Lloyd J. Beall, said the CSMC &quot;was composed of enlisted men, many of whom were old soldiers and commissioned officers, a number of whom had seen service before in the U.S. Marine Corps and elsewhere.&quot; The record of US Marine officers who &quot;resigned and tendered their swords to the Confederate Government&quot; were:

These officers assembled with the CSMC as it stood up in Richmond, Virginia, with the exception of Captain Tansill, who had resigned while still on board USS &quot;Congress&quot; at sea. Captain Tansill was arrested by order of Secretary Welles of the U.S. Navy when he arrived in New York on August 23, 1861, and was held without charge, hearing or trial. He was released on January 10, 1862, as part of a prisoner exchange, and subsequently joined the CSMC in Virginia. &quot;The gross injustice done him was recognized in an act of the Confederate Congress of April 11, 1863, which provided that &#x27;officers of the navy and Marine Corps who resigned from the navy and Marine Corps of the United States in consequence of secession, and who were arrested and imprisoned in consequence of such resignation, and who subsequently joined the navy and Marine Corps of the Confederate States,&#x27; should receive &#x27;leave of absence, pay for and during the term of such imprisonment, and up to the time of their appointment in the navy and marine corps of the Confederate States.&#x27;&quot;

===Manpower composition===
The breakdown of officer manpower composition was:
*One colonel-commandant
*One lieutenant colonel
*Three majors (a quartermaster, paymaster, and an adjutant)
*Ten captains
*Ten first lieutenants
*Twenty second lieutenants

The breakdown of enlisted manpower composition as of Sep 24, 1862 was:
*One sergeant major
*One quartermaster sergeant
*Sixty sergeants
*Sixty corporals
*840 privates
*Thirty drummers
*Thirty fifers
*Two principal musicians and two musicians

Although the CSMC had an authorized manpower of 1,026 men, its enrollment never approached that number; the figures for October 30, 1864 list only 539 officers and enlisted men. Though the officers were mostly former U.S. Marine officers, the head of the corps, Colonel-Commandant Lloyd J. Beall, was a former U.S. Army paymaster with no Marine experience. Major Lloyd J. Beall, USA graduated from the United States Military Academy, and had served in the First Infantry and Second Dragoons before becoming a paymaster from 1844 until the outbreak of the war. He resigned his commission on April 22, 1861, and was appointed Colonel-Commandant of the CS Marine Corps on May 23, 1861. Colonel Beall served throughout the war as the only Commandant of the Marine Corps.

===Unit organizations===
The C.S. Marine Corps was organized into six lettered companies (A to F) and numerous shore-based and shipboard detachments. Companies A, B, and C were originally formed between April 10 and June 29, 1861, at New Orleans, LA. Company D, initially recruited in Memphis, Tennessee and Mobile, Alabama (August - September 1861) served in Pensacola, FL before being disbanded there and reformed at Mobile in November, 1861. Company E was formed at Savannah, Georgia in July 1862. There was also a Company F, initially formed at New Orleans in the spring of 1861, where it served for a brief period before being disbanded; it was later reformed at Mobile in April 1863 and disbanded for the second time in June 1864.

Companies A, B, and C were individually transferred from New Orleans to Pensacola from April through June 1861. Company A was subsequently transferred to Savannah in September 1862 before being transferred to Camp Beall, Virginia, to join Companies B and C, already there. Company B was briefly transferred to Mobile in February 1862 before being transferred to Camp Beall a few weeks later to join Company C, which had already been transferred there in November, 1861 to form the nucleus of what would become the organization (with the addition of Companies A and B) known as the &quot;field battalion.&quot;

The battalion served in the defense of Richmond against riverine attack, provided ship&#x27;s detachments to warships based in the Norfolk area, and participated in the general Confederate retreat from Richmond, performing notable combat action in the rear guard of General Lee&#x27;s army as the Marine Battalion of Brigadier General (formerly Rear Admiral and commander of the Charleston Squadron, CSN) John R. Tucker&#x27;s Naval Brigade at the Battle of Saylor&#x27;s Creek (Virginia) on April 6, 1865. The majority of the battalion surrendered at Saylor&#x27;s Creek on April 7, 1865, with most of the remainder surrendering with the Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox, Virginia.

Company D, initially stationed in Pensacola was disbanded in December, 1861 after being used to fill-out Companies B and C, also serving at that station. Company D was reformed at Mobile and served there, where it remained until that city fell to U.S. forces. Company D was the last organized unit of the CSMC to surrender; elements of the company surrendered on May 9, 1865, at Citronelle, Alabama and the remaining platoon, under the command of 1st Lieutenant David G. Raney Jr., surrendered at Nanna Hubba Bluff, Alabama on May 10, 1865.

Company E, initially formed in Savannah, subsequently evacuated to Charleston, South Carolina. A detachment of the company was sent to Wilmington, NC and participated in the unsuccessful defense of Fort Fisher. The remainder of Company E, still at Charleston, ultimately evacuated to North Carolina and joined with General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee near Raleigh, North Carolina and surrendered with Brigadier General (formerly Rear Admiral and commander of the James River Squadron, CSN) Raphael Semmes&#x27;s Naval Brigade at Greensboro, North Carolina on April 28, 1865.

Company F served originally at New Orleans as a &quot;depot&quot; company (i.e., recruiting and training unit) before being disbanded. It was later reformed at Mobile, again as a depot company, supplying Marines for Company D and the battalion at Camp Beall, eventually being disbanded for the final time in June 1864.
CS Marine Corps units were stationed at Confederate naval bases, as well as helping garrison shore fortifications such as Fort Fisher in North Carolina. Marines also served on Confederate warships. In the famous battle between the ironclads and , Company C, Confederate States Marine Corps, served aboard CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, helping to man several of her guns.

In the summer of 1862, some CS Marine Corps troops were organized into squad-sized units and dispersed throughout the south. Dispersed Marine units were intended to provide training to overcome a shortage of trained naval gunners, with greater overall effect than their service as a single naval artillery battalion. With detachments spread at every major Confederate naval installation, Headquarters for the Confederate States Marines was established at Fort Darling and Camp Beall, located at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff on the James River in Virginia. As described above, three companies (A, B, and C) were stationed semi-permanently as the &quot;field battalion&quot; at CSMC headquarters. New CSMC officers were trained in the battalion prior to assignment to one of the detached companies (viz., D or E) or directly to one of the shore-based or shipboard Marine detachments. The &quot;field battalion&quot; Marines helped repulse the attack made on the bluff by U.S. naval forces including USS &quot;Monitor&quot; and in the summer of 1862.

Despite desertions and even near-mutinies, most Marines served competently and deserved Navy Secretary Stephen R. Mallory&#x27;s praise for their &quot;promptness and efficiency.&quot; The corps&#x27; weakness and lack of contribution to the Confederate war effort was due largely to internal squabbles, a poorly managed chain of command, the demands of shore duty, and Marines being given administrative assignments rather than combat duties. Also, with no funds for bounties, the corps could not easily enlist recruits. Until 1864, the monthly pay of enlisted men was $3 less than that of equivalent army grades. Only late in the war were the Marines allowed to draw from army conscripts to augment their ranks.

==Service during the war==
Confederate Marines saw their first naval action aboard (formerly ) off Hampton Roads, Virginia, March 8 to 9, 1862, and near the end of the war were part of the naval brigade that fought at Sailor&#x27;s Creek, Virginia.

From the Drewry&#x27;s Bluff and other major posts (Wilmington, Charleston, Pensacola, Norfolk, Galveston, and Savannah), Marine detachments were parsed out to serve on major warships and for special operations, including the captures of and , and an attack to free Confederate prisoners of war being held at Point Lookout, Maryland.

Marine sea-based amphibious operations included the &quot;Old&quot; CSS &quot;Savannah&quot; shore party at Fort Beauregard, Phillips Island, South Carolina to evacuate the garrison under attack. Marines under the command of Commodore Josiah Tattnall III were used to construct and man shore batteries which turned back Union gunboats and monitors both at Richmond and at Savannah.

The end of the war found most surviving Confederate States Marines gathered together in Richmond in support of the last desperate defenses of the South. Marines in Virginia were part of the General Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s Corps which fought with distinction at the Battle of Sayler&#x27;s Creek, the last major battle before the surrender of Lee&#x27;s Army at Appomattox.

==Uniform==


Their uniform resembled that prescribed for the Confederate Army, but since the CSMC was not as large and many of its records were destroyed in 1865, there is controversy about the exact details of the uniform. It is clear, however, that the Marines were often equipped out of the stores of whichever garrison was nearest their location. One description has the Marines dressed in frock coats of a particular (and undetermined) shade of gray and dark blue or black trousers. It appears that Confederate States Marines wore forage caps although it is unclear if there was any ornamentation on the cover. Much of the gear worn by the CSMC was imported from the United Kingdom and its empire, namely Canada.
===Rank Insignia===

The forage cap insignias were the same hunting horn surrounding the Marine corps M on a red background. This is verified as being placed on a sun hat worn by a CS marine at the 75 reunion.

<text>Star ratings are a type of rating scale using a star glyph or similar typographical symbol. It is used by reviewers for ranking things such as films, TV shows, restaurants, and hotels. For example, a system of one to five stars is commonly used in hotel ratings, with five stars being the highest rating.

Similar systems have been proposed for electing politicians in the form of score voting and STAR voting.

==Historical usage==

Repeated symbols used for a ranking date to Mariana Starke&#x27;s 1820 guidebook, which used exclamation points to indicate works of art of special value:

...I have endeavored... to furnish Travellers with correct lists of the objects best worth notice...; at the same time marking, with one or more exclamation points (according to their merit), those works which are deemed peculiarly excellent.

&quot;Murray&#x27;s Handbooks for Travellers&quot; and then the &quot;Baedeker Guides&quot; (starting in 1844) borrowed this system, using stars instead of exclamation points, first for points of interest and later for hotels.

The Michelin restaurant guide introduced a star as a restaurant rating in 1926, which was expanded to a system of one to three stars in 1931.

==Media==

===Books===
In 1915, Edward O&#x27;Brien began editing &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;. This annual compiled O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s personal selection of the previous year&#x27;s best short stories. O&#x27;Brien claimed to read as many as 8,000 stories a year, and his editions contained lengthy tabulations of stories and magazines, ranked on a scale of zero to three stars, representing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s notion of their &quot;literary permanence.&quot; He further listed stories with a ranking of three stars &quot;in a special &#x27;Roll of Honor.&#x27;&quot; In this list, O&#x27;Brien attached an additional asterisk to those stories that he personally enjoyed.

Oliver Herford&#x27;s essay &quot;Say it with Asterisks&quot;, quips &quot;Never, I think, were a mob of overworked employees so pitifully huddled together in an ill-ventilated factory as are the Asterisks in this Sweatshop of Twaddle.&quot; Literary editor Katrina Kenison dismisses O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s grading systems as &quot;excessive at best, fussy and arbitrary at worst.&quot;

Book reviewers generally do not use a star-rating system though there are exceptions. The &quot;West Coast Review of Books&quot; rates books on a scale of one (&quot;poor&quot;) to five (&quot;superior&quot;) stars. According to editor D. David Dreis, readers love the ratings but publishers don&#x27;t.

===Films===
In the 31 July 1928 issue of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, the newspaper&#x27;s film critic Irene Thirer began grading movies on a scale of zero to three stars. Three stars meant &#x27;excellent,&#x27; two &#x27;good,&#x27; and one star meant &#x27;mediocre.&#x27; And no stars at all &#x27;means the picture&#x27;s right bad,&#x27;&quot; wrote Thirer. Carl Bialik speculates that this may have been the first time a film critic used a star-rating system to grade movies. &quot;The one-star review of &quot;The Port of Missing Girls&quot; launched the star system, which the newspaper promised would be &#x27;a permanent thing.&#x27;

According to film scholar Gerald Peary, few newspapers adopted this practice until the French film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; &quot;started polling critics in the 1950s and boiling their judgment down to a star rating, with a bullet reserved for movies that the magazine didn&#x27;t like.&quot; The highest rating any film earned was five stars. The British film magazine &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; also rated films on a scale of one to four stars. Some critics use a &quot;half-star&quot; option in between basic star ratings. Leonard Maltin goes one further and gives &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot; a star rating.

Critics do not agree on what the cutoff is for a recommendation, even when they use the same scale. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert &quot;both consider[ed] a three-star rating to be the cutoff for a &quot;thumbs up&quot; on their scales of zero to four stars. Film critic Dave Kehr—who also uses a 0–4 star scale—believes &quot;two stars is a borderline recommendation&quot;. On a five-star scale, regardless of the bottom rating, 3 stars is often the lowest positive rating, though judging on a purely mathematical basis, 2 1/2 stars would be the dividing line between good and bad on a 0–5 scale. Common Sense Media uses a scale of one to five, where 3 stars are &quot;Just fine; solid&quot; and anything lower is &quot;Disappointing&quot; at best.

There is no agreement on what the lowest rating should be. Some critics make &quot;one star&quot; or a &quot;half-star&quot; their lowest rating. Dave Kehr believes that &quot;one star&quot; indicates the film has redeeming facets, and instead uses zero stars as his lowest rating.

Examples of rating scales:
*0–4: Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel, David Kehr and Peter Travers
*0.5–4: Steven H. Scheuer&#x27;s now-defunct film guide grades films from a half-star (&quot;abysmal&quot;) to four stars (&quot;excellent&quot;). Despite this, Scheuer&#x27;s guide intentionally gives Wes Craven&#x27;s film &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; no stars, making it the lowest-rated film in the book.
*0–5: &quot;The Times&quot;
*1–4: Film critic Leonard Maltin rates films on a scale of one through four stars, although his guide notes that there is no actual &quot;one star&quot; rating. For these &quot;bottom-of-the-barrel movies&quot;, Maltin&#x27;s guide uses the citation &quot;BOMB&quot;. However, according to Maltin, the 1981 Bo Derek film &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; &quot;nearly forced the editors of this book to devise a rating lower than BOMB&quot;.
*1–5: Common Sense Media, &quot;Empire&quot;

Critics have different ways of denoting the lowest rating when this is a &quot;zero&quot;. Some such as Peter Travers display empty stars. Jonathan Rosenbaum and Dave Kehr use a round black dot. Leslie Halliwell uses a blank space. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; uses a &quot;0&quot;, or as their former film critic dubbed it, the &quot;death doughnut&quot;. Roger Ebert used a thumbs-down symbol. Other critics use a black dot.

Critics also do not agree on what the lower ratings signify, let alone the lowest rating. While Maltin&#x27;s and Scheuer&#x27;s guides respectively explain that lowest rated films are &quot;BOMB(s)&quot; and &quot;abysmal&quot;, British film critic Leslie Halliwell instead writes that no star &quot;indicates a totally routine production or worse; such films may be watchable but are at least equally missable.&quot; Like Halliwell and Dave Kehr, film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum believes one-star films have some merit, however unlike Halliwell, Rosenbaum believes that no stars indicate a &quot;worthless&quot; movie. Roger Ebert occasionally gave zero stars to films he deemed &quot;artistically inept and morally repugnant.&quot; Scheuer&#x27;s guide calls &quot;one and a half star&quot; films &quot;poor&quot;, and &quot;one star&quot; films &quot;bad&quot;.

Not all film critics have approved of star ratings. Film scholar Robin Wood wondered if &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; readers accepted &quot;such blackening of their characters.&quot; Jay Scott of Canada&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; was an opponent of using symbols to summarize a review and wrote in 1992 that &quot;When Globe editors first proposed the four-star system of rating movies about a year ago, the response from Globe critics was, to put it mildly, underwhelming.&quot; More recently, Mark Kermode has expressed a dislike of star ratings (assigned to his online reviews but not his print or radio reviews) on the grounds that his verdicts are sometimes too complex to be expressed as a rating.

===Comedy and theatre===
Star ratings are also given out at stand-up comedy performances and theatre productions. Star ratings are given at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the largest arts festival in the world. Since 2010, the British Comedy Guide has collected over 4,300 reviews of around 1,110 different acts, across 83 different publications in the form of a star rating.

The use of star ratings is controversial because the public may ignore the reviews and concentrate more the star ratings alone.

===Video games===
Star ratings are not often used to rate the quality of a video game but are rather used within certain games for varying purposes. One notable use of the star system is to grade a player&#x27;s performance in completing a level with up to three stars, used in many modern multi-level games like &quot;Angry Birds&quot;. This three-star rating system challenges the player to repeat and fully master previously beaten levels in order to receive a perfect 3-star rating, which may confer other benefits or bonus content. Another use of star ratings is to denote the rarity of characters in video games where players are tasked in collecting numerous characters, such as &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes&quot; and &quot;&quot;, in which stronger and rarer characters are marked with more stars to make them appear more valuable. Stars are also used to rank a game or stage&#x27;s difficulty (such as in the SNES version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and its updates), or to rate the attributes of a selectable character or, in sports games, a team.

==Restaurant ratings==

Restaurant guides and reviewers often use stars in restaurant ratings. The Michelin system reserves star for exceptional restaurants, and gives up to three; the vast majority of recommended restaurants have no star at all. Other guides now use up to four or five stars, with one-star being the lowest rating. The stars are sometimes replaced by symbols such as a fork or spoon. Some guides use separate scales for food, service, ambiance, and even noise level.

The Michelin system remains the best known star system. A single star denotes &quot;a very good restaurant in its category&quot;, two stars &quot;excellent cooking, worth a detour&quot;, and three stars, &quot;exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey&quot;.

Michelin stars are awarded only for the quality of food and wine; the luxury level of the restaurant is rated separately, using a scale of one (&quot;quite comfortable&quot;) to five (&quot;luxury in the traditional style&quot;) crossed fork and spoon symbols.

==Hotel ratings==

Hotel luxury is often denoted by stars.

Other classifiers, such as the AAA Five Diamond Award, use diamonds instead of stars to express hotel rating levels.

Hotels are assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an elevator would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization.

In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticized by some who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laymen to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes.

== Financial product ratings ==
In the UK, providers and comparison websites often use stars to indicate how feature-rich financial products are.

==Military ranks==

The most senior military ranks in all services are classified by a star system in many countries, ranging from one-star rank which typically corresponds to brigadier, brigadier general, commodore or air commodore, to the most senior five-star ranks, which include Admiral of the Fleet, Grand Admiral, Field Marshal, General of the Army and Marshal of the Air Force—some five-star ranks only exist during large-scale conflicts.

==Other==
=== American college football ===
Recruits entering American college football are commonly ranked on a five-star scale, with five representing what scouts think will be the best college players.

===Transport safety===
International organisations use a star rating to rank the safety of transportation. EuroRAP have developed a Road Protection Score which is a scale for Star Rating roads for how well they protect the user from death or disabling injury when a crash occurs. The assessment evaluates the safety that is &#x27;built into&#x27; the road through its design, in combination with the way traffic is managed on it. The RPS protocol has also been adapted and used by AusRAP, usRAP and iRAP.

Euro NCAP awards &#x27;star ratings&#x27; based on the performance of vehicles in crash tests, including front, side and pole impacts, and impacts with pedestrians.

The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also uses a star ranking to rank the safety of vehicles in crash tests, including front, side, pole impacts, and rollovers, with 5 stars being the most secure.

===Voting and preferences===
Some web content voting systems use five-star grades. This allows users to distinguish content more precisely than with binary &quot;like buttons&quot;.

Many recommender systems, such as MovieLens or Amazon.com, ask people to express preferences using star ratings, then predict what other items those people are likely to enjoy. Predictions are often expressed in terms of the number of predicted stars.

==Unicode==

The Unicode Standard encodes several characters used for star ratings in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows block:

The STAR WITH LEFT HALF BLACK and LEFT HALF BLACK STAR are intended for use in left-to-right contexts where the half star is positioned to the right of one or more whole stars, whereas the STAR WITH RIGHT HALF BLACK and RIGHT HALF BLACK STAR are intended for use in right-to-left contexts (such as Arabic or Hebrew) where the half star is positioned to the left of one or more whole stars.

<text>Ivey Business School is the main business school of the Western University, located in London, Ontario, Canada. It offers full-time undergraduate and graduate programs in London, Ontario and maintains a Toronto facility for its EMBA program and two facilities, Toronto and Hong Kong, for its Ivey Academy (executive education) programs.

==History==

Business courses were first taught at Western in 1922 and the business school was officially created in 1950, when the School of Business Administration was established as a separate faculty at Western. In 1995, the school was renamed the Richard Ivey School of Business after an $11 million donation by the Richard M. Ivey family. The school is named after Richard G. Ivey, the father of Richard M. Ivey.

In 1998, Ivey was the first North American business school to open a campus in Hong Kong offering business programs at the Cheng Yu Tung Management Institute. In 2010, Ivey became the first North American business school to offer the CEMS Global Alliance in Management Education, joining the likes of London School of Economics, HEC Paris, ESADE, University of St. Gallen, and Bocconi University.

In 2013, the School abbreviated its name to &quot;Ivey Business School&quot; and updated its visual identity. The legal name of the Faculty of Business at Western University, however, remains Richard Ivey School of Business.

==Rankings==

Ivey Business School has consistently ranked among Canada&#x27;s top business schools. &quot;The Economist&quot; ranked Ivey&#x27;s MBA program best in Canada for Education Experience, Career Services, and Student Quality in 2021. In 2023, Ivey&#x27;s MBA program was ranked first in Canada by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;. Financial Times ranked Ivey&#x27;s Executive Education program number one in Canada. 

=== Canadian MBA Alliance ===
The school is also a founding member of the Canadian MBA Alliance which was created in 2013. All six members of the alliance rank among the world&#x27;s top 100 schools, according to their participation in key rankings – &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Business Week&quot;, and &quot;The Economist&quot;.

==Locations==
Ivey operates on four campuses:
*Richard Ivey Building on the main campus of the University of Western Ontario.
*Spencer Leadership Centre (formally known as Spencer Hall) in London, Ontario
*Donald K. Johnson Leadership Centre located in downtown Toronto at the Exchange Tower
*Cheng Yu Tung Management Institute is located in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre

On September 10, 2009, Ivey broke ground on a new faculty building on the Western campus in front of Brescia University College on former soccer fields. The project cost approximately $110 million, with the federal and provincial governments contributed $50 million in funding with the remainder funded by private donations. The building was to be designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects of Toronto. In September 2013, Ivey officially moved from their old building to new Richard Ivey Building located across campus.

== Publications ==

===Case studies===

With over 8,000 cases in their collection, Ivey Publishing adds more than 350 classroom-tested case studies each year. Ivey is among the largest producers and publishers of cases all around the world, just behind Harvard Business School. Recently, Ivey signed deals with Indian Institute of Management Calcutta to design and publish case studies.

===&quot;Ivey Business Journal&quot;===
&quot;Ivey Business Journal&quot; (&quot;IBJ&quot;) started in 1933 as the &quot;Quarterly Review of Commerce&quot;. The publication transitioned from a quarterly magazine to a bi-monthly web publication in the 2000s and is read in over 150 countries. The current editor of the journal is Thomas Watson.

===&quot;Ivey Business Review&quot;===
&quot;Ivey Business Review&quot; (&quot;IBR&quot;) is an undergraduate publication dealing with business strategy, written and managed by students in the honours business administration program at the School. It is published twice per academic year, in December and April, and is managed at the school&#x27;s main campus in London, Ontario. Published copies of IBR are available in print formator on the publication&#x27;s website. Since its inception, the magazine has published eight issues containing over 100 total articles and involving more than 150 students.

The &quot;Review&quot; is an original research–based publication with all content created for the magazine through collaboration between the writers and members of the editorial board. It focuses on providing actionable recommendations for specific businesses, industries, business models, strategies, or events, rather than management techniques for managers and leaders.

<text>Mushing is a sport or transport method powered by dogs. It includes carting, pulka, dog scootering, sled dog racing, skijoring, freighting, and weight pulling. More specifically, it implies the use of one or more dogs to pull a sled, most commonly a specialized type of dog sled on snow, or a rig on dry land.

==History==

The practice of using dogs to pull sleds dates back to at least 6000 BC. Remnants of sleds and harnesses has been found with canine remains in Siberia which carbon-dated to 7800–8000 years ago. Native American cultures also used dogs to pull loads.

For the better part of the 1600s, the Iroquois and French clashed in a series of attacks and reprisals. For this reason, Samuel de Champlain arranged to have young French men live with the natives, to learn their language and customs and help the French adapt to life in North America. These men, known as (runners of the woods), were the first European mushers in North America, extended French influence south and west and in 1609, New France controlled all the Canadian Shield. In 1680, the intendant of New France, Jacques Duchesneau de la Doussinière et d&#x27;Ambault, estimated that there was not one family in New France who did not have a &quot;son, brother, uncle or nephew&quot; among the . During the winter, sled became the ordinary transportation in the north of New France.

In 1760, the British Army completed the conquest of Canada and gained control of the Canadian Shield. Many accepted British rule and continued to use the sled dog. The French term became &quot;Mush!&quot; in English.

During the Klondike Gold Rush, many prospectors came in the Yukon with sled dogs. This &quot;Last Great Gold Rush&quot; has been immortalized by American author Jack London in &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. Sled-dog became the common mode of transportation in Yukon and in the new US Territory of Alaska.

In 1911, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen used sled dogs in a race to become the first person to reach the South Pole. He succeeded, while his competitor Robert Falcon Scott, who had instead used Siberian ponies, died.

By the time of the First World War, mushing had spread to European countries such as Norway, where dog sleds were used for nature tours, as ambulances in the woodlands and mountains, and to bring supplies to soldiers in the field.

During the 1925 serum run to Nome, 20 mushers and about 150 sled dogs relayed diphtheria antitoxin by dog sled across the U.S. territory of Alaska in five and a half days, saving the small city of Nome and the surrounding communities from an incipient epidemic.

=== Etymology ===
France was the first European power established in the Canadian Shield; accordingly, the and the voyageurs of New France used the French word , meaning &quot;walk&quot; or &quot;move&quot;, to command to the team to commence pulling. became &quot;mush!&quot; for English Canadians. &quot;Mush!&quot; is rarely used in modern parlance.

==Practice==
Mushing can be utilitarian, recreational, or competitive. Mushing as a sport is practiced worldwide, but primarily in North America, northern Europe and the Alps. Racing associations such as the International Federation of Sleddog Sports (IFSS) and the International Sled Dog Racing Association (ISDRA) are working toward organizing the sport and in gaining Olympic recognition for mushing. It is the state sport of Alaska. 
The most famous sled dog races in the world are: 

*Finnmarksløpet in Norway
*Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska
*La Grande Odyssée in France and Switzerland
*Yukon Quest in Alaska and the Yukon

Although dogsled racing gets more publicity and is seen now as the primary form of mushing, recreational mushing thrives as an unorganized sport providing a healthy outdoor form of winter exercise for families.

Mushing for utilitarian purposes includes anything from hauling wood or delivering milk or the mail to rural travel and equipment hauling. Dogs have been replaced by snowmobiles in many places, but some trappers and other isolated users have gone back to sled dogs, finding them safer and more dependable in extreme weather conditions.

==Dog team members==

Dog team members are given titles according to their position in the team relative to the sled. These include leaders or lead dogs, swing dogs, team dogs, and wheelers or wheel dogs.

&quot;Lead dogs&quot; steer the rest of the team and set the pace. Leaders may be single or double; the latter is more common now, though single leaders used to be more common during the mid-20th century. Sometimes a leader may be unhitched (a loose or free leader) to find the trail for the rest of the team, but the practice is uncommon and is not allowed at races. Qualities for a good lead dog are intelligence, initiative, common sense, and the ability to find a trail in bad conditions.

&quot;Swing dogs&quot; or &quot;point dogs&quot; are directly behind the leader (one dog if the team is in single hitch). They swing the rest of the team behind them in turns or curves on the trail. (Some mushers use the term &quot;swag dog&quot; to denote a team dog.)

&quot;Team dogs&quot; are those between the wheelers and the swing dogs, and add power to the team. A small team may not have dogs in this position. Alternatively, the term may be used to describe any dog in a dog team.

&quot;Wheel dogs&quot; are those nearest the sled and musher, and a good wheeler must have a relatively calm temperament so as not to be startled by the sled moving just behind it. Strength, steadiness, and ability to help guide the sled around tight curves are qualities valued in &quot;wheelers.&quot;

Originally, sled dogs would run in either one or two straight lines, depending on how many people were driving the sled (two lines if there was one person, one line if there were two people). However, now, all dogs run in two lines, even if there is more than one person.

== Equipment ==
Many pieces of equipment are useful or necessary for driving sled dogs, depending on the sled or vehicle, terrain, weather conditions, size of the team and dogs, speed of the run, and other factors.
=== Harnesses ===
Harnesses are worn by dogs used in mushing to allow them to run and pull with freedom of movement. They are designed to distribute pulling weight evenly over the body, and are made of material that is durable and lightweight to varying degrees. Many different styles of sled dog harnesses exist for specialized styles of mushing and dogs, with many outfitters evolving and updating designs and materials to fit the needs of different mushers. The most commonly used styles include X-back (also referred to as racing harnesses), half-back (used more commonly in mushing where the line angle is steeper such as canicross and bikejoring), and spreader-bar/freighting (used for hauling heavy loads low to the ground, or by wheel dogs on teams). Harnesses have certain requirements for some competitions such as weight pull, to ensure the safety of the dog in their task. 
=== Sleds ===
Dogsleds can be a variety of styles, ranging from highly traditional wooden sleds lashed with twine, to modern lightweight racing sleds made of carbon fiber or aluminum and outfitted with utilities such as steering mechanisms. The nomadic tribes of Siberia such as the Chukchi used sleds which rode low to the ground (known as a &quot;narta&quot;), and sat or lie down to ride them while the dogs pulled - today most mushers use a standing style sled with a handlebar, and foot grips on top of the runners. Sleds range in length, with longer toboggan-style sleds used for expedition and long-distance mushing in order to carry more needed supplies, and &quot;basket&quot; sleds used more commonly in racing and on groomed trails. Kicksleds can be used as a small recreational dog sled, pulled by one or two dogs. 

Sleds normally have some form of braking system, the most common of which are a metal brake (a metal bar or claw) and a rubber drag-mat made of tire or snowmobile track; many sleds have both, for controlling speed in different conditions. Full-sized sleds are typically outfitted with a sled bag used for carrying equipment or injured/tired dogs in the sled basket. For racing competitions, sled bags are often required to have ventilation for dog safety.

=== Other Equipment ===
Other gear used in mushing includes but may not be limited to:

* Gangline: A cable and rope line system connecting the sled to the dogs&#x27; harnesses and collars, usually with carabiners, metal snaps, bungees, and knots.
* Tugline/s: Individual rope or cable sections made of the same material as the gangline which attach to the dogs&#x27; harnesses
* Snow Hook: A metal anchor-like hook used for securing the team in deep snow or ice when stopping on the trail
* Snub-line: A securing rope or cable used to tie the team to a fixed object such as a tree or post before beginning a run, or while resting.
* Picket Line: Used to attach dogs in a secure area before hooking them into a gangline, or while camping on the trail.

==Bikejoring==
Bikejoring is dog mushing similar to skijoring, canicross, and dog scootering. A dog or team of dogs is attached with a towline to a bicycle. Bikejoring and canicross probably developed from skijoring and dogsled racing. Bikejoring is also sometimes used to train racing sled-dogs out of season. Beginning in the early 1990&#x27;s, a hybrid of traditional bikejoring developed where riders use devices attached the side of their bikes (vs traditional front mounted attachments).

==Dog scootering==

Dog scootering uses one or more dogs to pull a human riding an unmotorized kick scooter. It is similar to mushing, which is done in the winter, but generally with fewer dogs and with a scooter instead of a dogsled. The dogs wear the same harnesses that sled dogs wear, and are hooked to the scooter with a gangline. The gangline usually incorporates a bungee cord to smooth out the shocks of speeding up and takeoff. Dog scooterers get together for fun runs, where a number of dog scooterers run their dogs and scooters on the same trails. Fun runs may be just a morning run, or can be a weekend-long activity with multiple runs scheduled. This is still a maturing activity, but there are a few formal dog races that include scooter events.

<text>The Beiyang Army (), named after the Beiyang region, was a Western-style Imperial Chinese Army established by the Qing dynasty in the early 20th century. It was the centerpiece of a general reconstruction of the Qing military system in the wake of the Boxer Rebellion and the First Sino-Japanese War, becoming the dynasty&#x27;s first regular army in terms of its training, equipment, and structure. The Beiyang Army played a major role in Chinese politics for at least three decades and arguably right up to 1949. It played an instrumental role in the 1911 Revolution against the Qing dynasty, and, by dividing into warlord factions known as the Beiyang clique (), ushered in a period of regional division. 

The Beiyang Army had its origins in the Newly Created Army established in late 1895 under Yuan Shikai&#x27;s command. Unlike its predecessors, it had a formal structure with infantry, cavalry, artillery, and logistical branches, and maintained strict training and discipline. The brigade-sized force was expanded over the years with new recruits and by incorporating other units, before serving as the core of a larger army after Yuan was appointed the Viceroy of Zhili and Northern Ocean (&quot;Beiyang&quot;) Minister in 1901. The tensions between Russia and Japan in Manchuria in early 1904 caused Empress Dowager Cixi to agree to Yuan&#x27;s request to raise more divisions, and he also used his senior position in the Army Reorganization Bureau to prioritize its funding. By 1907 the Beiyang Army had 60,000 men organized in six divisions, some of whom served in the Inner City of Beijing as the emperor&#x27;s palace guard, and on the eve of the 1911 Revolution it was the strongest military force of the Qing dynasty.

Yuan Shikai used his position as the commander of the Beiyang Army as leverage to negotiate the abdication of the Qing emperor during the Revolution in exchange for himself to be the first president of the Republic of China. He used the army to maintain his control, but his decision to stop rotating officers during that time led to them turning their divisions into their own power base. This made them influential leaders in their own right after Yuan&#x27;s death in 1916. A series of political crises ended with the general Duan Qirui taking control of the Beiyang clique until disputes over strategy and a power struggle split the army between his Anhui clique and the Zhili clique of Feng Guozhang and Cao Kun. Military commanders had expanded their armies in response to the Second Revolution, the National Protection War, and the Constitutional Protection Movement, so as the Warlord Era began there were an estimated 536,000 men under arms in northern China as of 1919.

Duan Qirui was able to maintain control over the government in Beijing through figureheads from 1917 to 1920, but that year saw the outbreak of the Zhili–Anhui War, causing the split of the Beiyang Army between several factions. The next four years resulted in several wars between the Anhui, Zhili, and Fengtian cliques, the latter representing the holdings of Zhang Zuolin in Manchuria. The warlord conflicts of the early 1920s led to Zhang Zuolin emerging as the strongest of the northern warlords by 1926, when the Kuomintang&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army began their Northern Expedition to reunite China. Zhang put together the National Pacification Army from his and other Beiyang warlord forces, which had a total strength of around 700,000. They were defeated in the spring of 1928 and the Kuomintang capture of Beijing marked the formal end of the Warlord Era and the Beiyang government, though some parts of China continued to be led by warlords until 1949.

==Origins in the late Qing (to 1900)==

The traditional military forces of the Qing dynasty were the Manchu Banners and the Green Standard Army. The Bannermen were hereditary soldiers and in addition to pay also received other privileges from the government. They were stationed in garrisons in Beijing and other major cities. The Green Standard Army, despite its name, was primarily a police force rather than an army, and had garrisons in each province. The military skills of both the Bannermen and the Green Standard troops gradually declined over the next two centuries, in large part because their officers did not consider training to be important, and by the middle of the 19th century they could only put up a minimal defense. As late as the 1890s much of the Chinese army was still equipped with long bows, swords, and spears, and many of their firearms were antiquated matchlocks. Starting around that time two other forces emerged in China after the traditional army failed to stop the Nian and Taiping Rebellions: mercenaries hired by provincial governors known as &quot;braves,&quot; and modernized units consisting of braves who were trained with European military drill. The most prominent of the latter were Zeng Guofan&#x27;s Xiang Army and Li Hongzhang&#x27;s Huai Army. The braves, relatively well armed and paid, were estimated to make up ten percent of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s armed forces and were private armies raised and funded by provincial officials, because the ethnic Manchu dynasty was reluctant to provide funding for armies led by Han Chinese. The Green Standard Army was relegated to local security duty while the braves were the rapid response force that could be deployed to any part of the Qing Empire. Li Hongzhang, who founded the Huai Army in 1862 and later became the Viceroy (or governor-general) of Zhili and Commissioner of the Northern Seas (Beiyang), used it as his personal power base and provided for its equipment and funding.
By the time of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–95, the Huai Army was considered to be the best force the Qing dynasty could field. Its arsenal included Mauser breechloader rifles, Krupp artillery, and a large quantity of ammunition. The quality of this equipment was comparable to that of the Imperial Japanese Army at the time, and its field commanders were experienced veterans who distinguished themselves during the Nian Rebellion. However, the Huai Army was still not considered a fully modernized force. The training of its soldiers used elements of old Chinese drill, sometimes with spears and other medieval weapons instead of firearms, and lacked proper marksmanship practice and the coordination of small units. There were reports during the war that some soldiers did not know how to use their firearms or artillery. Discipline was not strongly maintained, and the Chinese were more likely to abandon their positions during battle. The Huai Army also did not have organized supply, medical, transport, or engineering services, so the soldiers on campaign had to live off the land or take goods from the local population, as they did in Korea during the war. Chinese forces in Korea suffered a series of defeats, and in September 1894 the Japanese victory at the Battle of Pyongyang largely destroyed the Huai Army.

The defeat of China&#x27;s best forces by Japan caused the Qing court to authorize the creation of units based entirely on the Western model. Before the end of 1895 two organizations were established for this purpose: the Newly Created Army organized by Yuan Shikai in the province of Zhili, and the Self-Strengthening Army organized by Zhang Zhidong in Nanjing. In contrast to the simple organization of the braves, these two armies both had dedicated infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, and other technical branches, and specific attention was given to the recruitment, training, discipline, and pay of the soldiers. German officers assisted with the creation of these forces, and the German Army was specifically used as the example to follow. Unlike earlier forces, the Newly Created Army received its funding from the central government&#x27;s Ministry of Finance. It was initially the size of a brigade and its foreign staff included Constantin von Hanneken and Johan Wilhelm Normann Munthe. The idea for it originated with Hanneken during the war, who wanted to create a foreign-trained corps to become the basis of a new imperial (instead of provincial) army, and Prince Gong submitted his plan in a memorial to the throne. On 8 December 1895, Yuan Shikai was appointed commander of the Newly Created Army, with the backing of the Prince Qing, Minister of War Ronglu, and Li Hongzhang. 

The officer corps of this brigade-sized force in the late 1890s included five future presidents of the Republic of China, one prime minister, and multiple provincial governors; a testament to how influential the Beiyang Army would become. But during the first several years of their existence, the Newly Created and Self-Strengthening Armies were considered experimental units. During the coup that ended the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform of the Guangxu Emperor, the reformers attempted to gain the support of Yuan Shikai and his troops, which were considered the best in north China, to counter the military forces of the conservative Ronglu. Yuan refused to participate in the plot, instead giving it away, and Empress Dowager Cixi regained full control over the Qing government after the emperor was detained. Following the coup, the Qing court wanted to strengthen the defenses of the capital. On the recommendation of Ronglu in December 1898, several existing units in north China were placed under his direct command as the Wuwei Corps (&quot;Wuweijun&quot;), which is also translated as the Guards Army. Yuan Shikai&#x27;s Newly Created Army was made part of the Wuwei Corps as its Right Division, and was considered the best of the five guards divisions. When the Boxer Rebellion started in late 1899 Yuan was appointed as governor of Shandong province to maintain order there, and he took the Right Division with him. The four other divisions of the Guards Army were either destroyed or took heavy casualties in combat against the foreign relief forces that arrived in Zhili in the summer of 1900.

==Yuan Shikai&#x27;s ascendancy (1901–1908)==

Yuan Shikai had been recognized as a military specialist by the Qing court in 1899, whose Right Division of the Guards Army was well trained and well equipped with standardized uniforms and weaponry, the latter consisting of Mauser rifles, Maxim machine guns, and one- to six-pounder artillery pieces. During his time in Shandong the division was strengthened with additional troops, including Zhang Zhidong&#x27;s Self-Strengthening Army, and became the only unit of the Wuwei Corps that was not decimated by the Boxer Rebellion, which ended the corps as an organization. The other semi-modernized Manchu Banner forces, the Peking Field Force and the Tiger Spirit Division, were also destroyed in battle. When the imperial court began rebuilding the security forces of the Beijing metropolitan area in 1901, Yuan Shikai was put in charge of this task.

The Empress Dowager Cixi and conservative officials recognized the need for reform to preserve the dynasty after the Boxer Rebellion. They were willing to embrace military reorganization much more than other aspects of modernization. Among the main changes of the Qing New Policies, ordered by edicts in September 1901, were the establishment of a military academy in each province to entirely replace military examinations and the creation of a Western-style standing army along with reserves. 

The Beiyang Army began to take shape after Yuan Shikai became the Viceroy of Zhili in late 1901, following the death of Li Hongzhang. He started by putting together two divisions for the standing army in Zhili, with the first of these, founded in October 1902, being a new formation known as the Left Division of the Beiyang Standing Army. In December 1902, the Qing court also ordered him to begin training a force of several thousand Manchu Bannermen volunteers who could serve as Imperial Guards in the Inner City of Beijing. During their initial training in 1903 they were called the Metropolitan Banners Standing Army, and were led by the nobleman Tieliang. Yuan had requested Tieliang&#x27;s assistance with the training of the Bannermen, and in June 1903 they created an office for training the Metropolitan Banners. This became the basis for the Military Training Bureau that was created in December 1903 as a section of the larger Army Reorganization Bureau, which was established to oversee the military reform taking place all over China. The Army Reorganization Bureau&#x27;s leadership included Yuan Shikai and Tieliang, and its overall director was Prince Qing. It eventually became more important than the traditional Ministry of War, and was an adjunct of the Grand Council that reported directly to Empress Dowager Cixi.

In January 1904, as tensions rose between Japan and Russia in China&#x27;s Manchuria region shortly before the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Yuan Shikai sent a memorial to the throne asking for funding to double the size of the Beiyang Army. This increase in Yuan Shikai&#x27;s military power around the Qing capital reflected the trust he had with Empress Dowager Cixi. The staffing for the Army Reorganization Bureau in Beijing came from Yuan Shikai&#x27;s military associates, and it became an extension of his influence to such a degree that the Japanese military attaché to China alleged in 1906 that it was more of a nominal organization and had less relevance than one of its departments, Yuan&#x27;s Military Training Bureau in Tianjin. But in reality, Yuan Shikai was able to make use of the Army Reorganization Bureau to oversee all of the New Army forces across the entire Qing Empire and to funnel money from the military reform budget to his own Beiyang Army. Although every province was ordered to create New Army units in 1904, they rarely received funds for this purpose from the Army Reorganization Bureau, because it was mostly going to Yuan Shikai&#x27;s administration in Zhili. 
In 1904–05 the Beiyang Army was expanded to a size of four divisions. The Metropolitan Banners Standing Army was redesignated as the 1st Division, while the Left Division of the Beiyang Standing Army became the 2nd Division. Some members of Zhang Zhidong&#x27;s Self-Strengthening Army became the cadre of the 3rd Division, which was put together from the Tianjin police force founded by Yuan in 1902. The original Newly Created Army, which had been Right Division of the Guards Army, became the 4th Division. Later on in 1905, two more divisions were added, bringing the total to six. The 5th Division was created from elements of the Right Division in Shandong that fought against rebels during Boxer Rebellion, and the 6th Division was made from elements of the Left Division of the Guards Army and the Self-Strengthening Army. The designations of some these was changed several times. The six divisions together had about 60,000 men.

In addition, in 1902 several military schools were established in Zhili for the Beiyang Army by Yuan Shikai, including a two-year military academy (the Baoding Military Academy), a staff college, an NCO school, and a few specialized officer courses. The Baoding Academy became the largest military training school in China until after the 1920s and produced the majority of officers that served in Chinese armies over the next few decades. Yuan Shikai also sent many officer cadets to study in Japan, and while foreign-trained officers were a small fraction of the overall Chinese officer corps, they were a significant portion of Beiyang Army officers. The staff or war college was for senior officers and focused on higher level staff work, the necessity of which was made more clear by the massive armies that fought on both sides of the Russo-Japanese War, which required complex logistical management.

During this early period from 1901 to 1904, foreign observers noted that the quality of the soldier in the Beiyang Army was a noticeable improvement from the previous forces. More efficient drill and stronger discipline were among the changes. But these changes were mostly limited to the Beiyang Army. In the rest of the empire, no real effort was made to eliminate obsolete units, so the Chinese ground forces remained a mix of modernized and medieval forces. The New Army forces that were equipped Mauser and Krupp weaponry and participated in field maneuvers existed alongside traditional Bannermen, Green Standard, and local militia troops that still trained with matchlocks and long bows. The progress made in this period was still a major development compared to just several years earlier, and in September 1904 the imperial court approved a proposal from the Army Reorganization Bureau to create a standardized table of ranks and pay, organization, supply and support system, and other policies to form the basis for creating 36 New Army divisions across China. The plan was officially announced in January 1905. Many of these suggestions were already in use by the Beiyang Army and were based on the Japanese system. However, it did not alter the balance of power between the provinces and the imperial government, allowing provincial governments to organize and finance the New Armies and have command over them except in major wars. These divisions were still bureaucratic organizations rather than private armies of individual leaders.

In the fall of 1904 the Beiyang Army started holding field maneuvers involving the newly formed divisions. Held in Hejian, to the southeast of Baoding, in November 1904, these field maneuvers were China&#x27;s first modern war game. There were a small number of foreign observers and they praised the performance of the Beiyang troops. Larger war games were held in October 1905 at the same location. The intended goal was to show both the Chinese public and the world that China now had a capable army. Foreign journalists and government officials from other parts of China were invited to watch the field maneuvers, which involved by some estimates as many as 50,000 troops, who were divided into two armies to stage a mock invasion of Zhili from Shandong. Infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineering, medical, veterinary, transportation, and telegraph units were involved. The event was praised by civilian officials and journalists, while military observers were more critical, though they noted that it was still a massive improvement since the Boxer Rebellion. The capability of the technical branches was still limited, despite the usage of the Beijing–Hankou railway to quickly move units for the first time. Officers were well trained but had some shortfalls, such as a lack of knowledge of their role and a lack of initiative, while the enlisted soldiers received the most praise for their higher military bearing and &quot;esprit de corps&quot; compared to the troops of the old-style armies. The 1907 field maneuvers were also notable because they focused on training lower level officers, being carried out at the level of mixed brigades. Another change from the previous interations was that Japanese military advisors were not involved in the planning or execution of the war game.
Desertion among the Beiyang Army still occurred at a significant level, and some of that was among the conscripts that had been drafted from different parts of northern China. The Qing government officially did not have conscription, but it was practiced by the Beiyang Army. Decapitation was one punishment that was used for desertion. Yuan Shikai maintained strict discipline, but he tried to make sure that the troops received their pay on time. Officers were recruited on the basis of their education and ability rather than on personal connections, and eventually about half of the Beiyang Army officers were either from military schools other than Yuan&#x27;s Baoding Military Academy, or, more often, had studied abroad, especially in Japan.

Yuan Shikai&#x27;s influence up to this point reached its peak by 1906. The Beiyang Army had become the strongest military force of the Qing dynasty and was the largest of the New Armies created over the previous decade. Graduates of the officer schools that Yuan had set up in Zhili were sent back to their home provinces to lead New Army units there, and cadres from Beiyang divisions that were personally selected by him were used in other parts of the country to create new formations. Other Beiyang generals were given high ranks in the Green Standard Army or as commanders of provincial forces. The Army Reorganization Bureau was largely staffed by Yuan&#x27;s associates, and he had allies in the form of the Empress Dowager and Prince Qing. However, he also had many enemies in both the imperial court and the provinces because of his past intrigues and new rivalries. These included conservative Manchu nobles that were suspicious of his power and other provincial governors who had to fund his Beiyang Army with their tax revenue. 

His rivals struck in the fall of 1906, during debates over administrative reforms to the military bureaucracy. He and Prince Qing were accused of corruption and abuse of power by Tieliang, their former ally, and Grand Councilor Qu Hongji. Tieliang had previously assisted Yuan in building the Beiyang Army, but turned against him for several reasons. After this Yuan himself requested that the Empress Dowager reduce his power by transferring four of the six Beiyang divisions from his command as Viceroy of Zhili to the newly formed Ministry of the Army, which replaced the Army Reorganization Bureau. However, except for in the 1st Division, some of the senior officers were more loyal to Yuan than to the Banner officer Fengshan, who had been appointed by Tieliang to lead the Beiyang divisions under the Ministry of the Army, and they resigned. The decline in Yuan Shikai&#x27;s position was only temporary, because in September 1907 he was appointed to the Grand Council and was made the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Although his direct control over the Beiyang Army was reduced, some of Yuan&#x27;s close allies were appointed as commanders of units sent to the Manchurian or Jiangsu provinces, or to key posts in the Ministry of the Army. After the death of Empress Dowager Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor in November 1908, the Prince Regent of the new young emperor, Prince Chun, initially worked with him, but on 2 January 1909 he had Yuan dismissed from his posts and retired, ostensibly for medical reasons.

===List of original Beiyang divisions===
*1st Division – Founded in December 1902 with Manchu Bannermen that were sent for Yuan Shikai to train by the Qing court. It was intended to replace the semi-modern Manchu Banner units that had been destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion. It was not intended to be an official imperial palace guard but it was able to serve in that capacity, and in 1907 it was transferred from Baoding to Beijing to replace the 6th Division in that role. With the exception of a few Han Chinese officers on its staff, most of the division came from the Metropolitan Banners or the Banner garrisons in other parts of north China. The 1st Division was eventually replaced in its role at the palace by a separate Imperial Guards Division in 1911.
*2nd Division – Founded in October 1902 as the Left Division of the Beiyang Standing Army. Part of the 2nd Division was used to form the 2nd Mixed Brigade in 1907, which was sent to Manchuria. 
*3rd Division – In 1904–05 this designation was briefly given to the former Right Division of the Wuwei Corps until it was renumbered. Starting from 1905 the 3rd Division was formed from the Tianjin police force that Yuan Shikai had established in 1902, after the foreign powers imposed on China the rule that no military forces could be stationed in or around the city. It also reportedly used a cadre from Zhang Zhidong&#x27;s Self-Strengthening Army. In 1907 the 3rd Division was sent to Manchuria.
*4th Division – From 1905 it was Yuan Shikai&#x27;s original Newly Created Army from 1895, which had also been the Right Division of the Wuwei Corps. Part of the 4th Division was used to form the 2nd Mixed Brigade in 1907, which was sent to Manchuria.
*5th Division – Founded in 1905 with the vanguard of the Right Division of the Wuwei Corps in Shandong. Part of the 5th Division was used to form the 1st Mixed Brigade in 1907, which was sent to Manchuria.
*6th Division – Reportedly included the former Left Division of the Wuwei Corps and a brigade of the Self-Strengthening Army. The Left Division had been used in Beijing to protect the emperor&#x27;s family after the Boxer Rebellion, and after it became part of the new 6th Division in 1905 the entire unit was rotated through there, until it was relieved by the 1st Division in 1907. Also that year, part of the 6th Division was used to form the 1st Mixed Brigade, which was sent to Manchuria.

The following divisions were outside of the Beiyang Army in Zhili province, but were founded with cadres of Beiyang troops:
*7th Division – It was created in 1906 from the Beiyang Army&#x27;s 13th Brigade, which had been deployed outside of Zhili, to Jiangsu province, in 1905.
*20th Division – Formed in 1909 in Fengtien province, Manchuria, on the basis of the 1st Mixed Brigade from the Beiyang Army.

==The Beiyang Army under Qing control (1909–1910)==

After the dismissal of Yuan Shikai in January 1909 by Prince Chun, the Prince Regent of the recently enthroned Xuantong Emperor, some of his proteges were still left in key positions by the Qing government. During this time four Beiyang divisions were under the direct command of the Ministry of the Army while the others were under provincial governors. Prince Chun brought the rest of the military under the control of Manchu princes. In the summer of 1909 he named the emperor the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, a position that he held in an acting capacity as his regent, and appointed inexperienced princes to lead the Ministry of the Army, the Navy Bureau, and the General Staff Council. He declared that the emperor was the commander-in-chief another two times between then and the outbreak of the 1911 Revolution, as an effort to promote unity, patriotism and a military spirit. At the same time there were increased revolts and mutinies among New Army soldiers, caused by a range of issues, including the spread of revolutionary propaganda. In 1908 and 1910 there were significant uprisings that led to brigades or divisions being disbanded and rebuilt entirely. But these events happened mostly outside of northern China and the Beiyang Army remained unaffected by the disturbances. The revolutionary support was strongest in the areas south of the Yangtze river. 

All of the Beiyang senior commanders remained loyal to the Qing dynasty, and to some extent to Yuan Shikai, who remained in contact with several officers. Duan Qirui, Feng Guozhang, and Wang Shizhen were examples of senior commanders that had personal loyalty to Yuan. But some of the senior officers had served in the military bureaucracy of the central government or in provincial governments, developing their own connections, and after Yuan was dismissed from his posts he could no longer assist them with their own advancement. The Qing government had also given senior Beiyang officers traditional ranks in the Green Standard and Banner forces and had used Beiyang divisions as a palace guard. Others were much older and were loyal to the monarchy more than to Yuan Shikai. Among the junior officers, because Yuan chose to recruit them based on merit, many were from military schools outside of north China, or had studied abroad, and therefore were less likely to have personal loyalty to him. The Japanese-trained officers were the most likely to have anti-Qing and anti-Yuan views. After he was eventually called back by the imperial court, Yuan immediately removed several officers from command. The Beiyang Army, unlike the older Huai Army founded by Li Hongzhang, was a bureaucratic organization with regular rotations of officers in command positions, appointment based on education and merit, and with funding being provided by the government instead of by an individual official. Among ordinary soldiers of the Beiyang Army there was no widespread political sentiment, but there was resentment due to the strict discipline and poor living conditions.

In late 1910 the German-trained Manchu noble Yinchang became the Minister of the Army. Right away, he placed all six original Beiyang Army divisions under the direct command of the Ministry, although only four of them were in Zhili. The 3rd Division was left stationed in Manchuria and the 5th was in Shandong. He also dismissed Fengshan, who had been unpopular among the troops, and became the commander of the Beiyang Army.

==The 1911 Revolution==
The regency in the final years of the Qing dynasty proved to be incapable of solving the challenges in China and faced growing ethnic resentment against the Manchus as well as revolutionary agitation against the monarchy, which became stronger after the election of provincial assembles in 1909. Its measures in response to the demands from the elected assemblies and from the provinces were seen as inadequate, and the central government&#x27;s nationalization of the railroads led to an uprising in Sichuan province in September 1911. This was followed by a mutiny of New Army units starting on 10 October 1911 in Wuchang, one of the three cities that now forms Wuhan, in Hubei province. By the 12th, most of the Hubei New Army joined the rebels and had declared one of their officers, Li Yuanhong, the leader of a revolutionary military government, which was also joined by some local civilian leaders. Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou had completely fallen, and the Manchu governor-general of Hubei and Hunan, who had to flee the area, sent a message to Beijing asking for &quot;crack troops&quot; to be deployed. After meeting with his military leaders on the same day, including Zaitao and Yulang at the General Staff Council, Navy Minister Zaizhen, and Army Minister Yinchang, Prince Chun ordered Yinchang to lead the ground campaign against the uprising and ordered the navy commander-in-chief, Admiral Sa Zhenbing, to take some ships of the ocean-going fleet at Shanghai up the Yangtze river to assist. 

Yuan Shikai, living in retirement, was asked to return. He turned down the offer of becoming the governor-general of Hubei and having joint command over the troops with Yinchang, but he did start giving them advice. When the uprising broke out there were several Beiyang Army divisions preparing to take part in the fall 1911 field maneuvers not far from Beijing. In addition to these there was also a mixed brigade from the 20th Division and the entire new Imperial Guards Division, which was under the Prince Regent&#x27;s direct command. On 14 October they were informed the war games were cancelled and were reorganized into three corps (sometimes translated as armies): the 1st Corps to be led by Yinchang against the rebels, consisting of the 4th Division and one brigade each from the 2nd and 6th, the 2nd Corps led by Feng Guozhang to act as a reserve, with the mixed brigade and the 3rd and 5th Divisions that were not in the area at the time, and the 3rd Corps led by Zaitao to defend Beijing using the Manchu divisions, the 1st and the Imperial Guards. Using a section of the Beijing–Shenyang railway and then the Beijing–Hankou railway, the 1st Corps was rapidly deployed to the front near Wuhan, and its first elements arrived on the 15th. The 4th Division, the main force, arrived on the 21st, and Yinchang set up his command post at Xiaogan on the 23rd, about 45 miles away from Hankou.
The Beiyang troops and the naval force that arrived around that time, the latter including one cruiser (the ) and several gunboats, began their assault on Wuhan on 27 October. Even though they were ready earlier, there was a delay in launching the attack for unclear reasons. One possible reason was that Yinchang&#x27;s subordinates were waiting for Yuan Shikai to return and take command. Yuan, who had been in negotiations with the Qing government, was named the commissioner of all forces in Hubei on the 27th and Yinchang was recalled to Beijing, while Feng Guozhang was named 1st Corps commander and Duan Qirui replaced him at the 2nd Corps. The ground assault was led by the 4th Division under acting commander Wang Yujia and Wang Zhanyuan&#x27;s 3rd Brigade, moving south along the Beijing-Hankou railway. Advancing with support from their artillery and the naval guns of the warships, the Beiyang Army pushed back the rebel troops in three days and reached the end of the line. Yinchang departed for Beijing on the 30th as imperial troops completed their takeover of Hankou. But when Feng Guozhang led an attack against some holdouts, a series of explosions caused by artillery damaged much of the city, and when the fighting ended as much as two-thirds of Hankou had been leveled. By 1 November the remaining revolutionaries abandoned Hankou for Hanyang.

At this point Yuan ordered Feng Guozhang to stop his attack temporarily before entering Hanyang, even though Admiral Sa wanted to continue, ostensibly because the army needed to rest. He wanted to use this as leverage to negotiate with the Qing, because by the time Hankou was retaken by imperial troops major uprisings had broken out in other parts of the empire, including political threats from the 20th Division commander near Beijing. A session of the National Assembly was convened in late October and they also made demands. Under pressure, in early November Prince Chun appointed Yuan Shikai as prime minister, having dismissed Prince Qing and his Manchu princes&#x27; cabinet. When several Beiyang officers of the 6th Division attempted to join the rebel side, Yuan quickly had them removed, and the 20th Division was brought under control, restoring order within the Beiyang Army. He also shifted units around northern China to stabilize the situation and prevent any uprisings at important locations. Having consolidated his military power in the north, and with his Beiyang Army remaining the core of the royalist forces, Yuan then pressured Prince Chun to resign as imperial regent in early December.

Meanwhile, the naval crews, who were sympathetic to the revolutionaries, allowed many of the rebel soldiers to cross the river from Hankou to Hanyang, and on 12 November the navy defected to their side. After a rebel counterattack at Hankou was fought off on the 17th, on the 20th Feng Guozhang sent his forces into Hanyang on pontoon bridges built by his engineers, and the Beiyang Army took control of the entire city on the 27th despite strong opposition from the rebels. By the time this was done, Yuan Shikai was in negotiations with revolutionaries and told Feng to not advance on Wuchang. This ended the Beiyang Army&#x27;s role in the fighting, and the army had demonstrated that its leadership, organization, and training was better than that of the revolutionary forces, which, despite their bravery, were a poorly organized mix of local New Army troops and a large number of new volunteer units that were raised by the revolutionaries in October and November. Because several provinces were in open rebellion by this point, among other factors, Yuan Shikai started talks for a political solution with Li Yuanhong, who was more interested after the weapons arsenal at Hanyang was captured by the Beiyang Army. Being in an advantageous position compared to both the Manchu imperial court and the internally divided republicans, in large part because of his control over the army, Yuan was able to reach a deal. Sun Yat-sen, who had recently been elected president of a republican provisional government in Nanjing, agreed to resign in Yuan&#x27;s favor if he secured the abdication of the emperor. While this was going on, in January 1912 a memorial to the throne signed by several generals stated that the loyalty of their troops to the Qing dynasty was no longer reliable. The imperial court largely acquiesced to all of this, and Empress Dowager Longyu issued the abdication on behalf of the young emperor on 12 February 1912.

===Structure during the Wuchang Uprising===
The structure of the Beiyang forces that were mobilized to fight the revolutionary uprising in Hubei was as follows.

The three corps are sometimes translated as &quot;army&quot; in English sources.

*1st Corps (Yinchang, later Feng Guozhang) 
**4th Division (Wu Fengling, later Wang Yujia (acting) and Chen Guangyuan)
**3rd Brigade (Wang Zhanyuan) – of the 2nd Division
**11th Brigade (Li Chun) – of the 6th Division
*2nd Corps (Feng Guozhang, later Duan Qirui)
**5th Division (Zhang Yongcheng)
**5th Brigade (Lu Yongxiang) – of the 3rd Division
**39th Brigade (Wu Zhenxiang) – of the 20th Division
**2nd Mixed Brigade (Wang Ruxian, later Lan Tianwei) – of the 2nd and 4th Divisions
*3rd Corps (Zaitao) 
**1st Division (He Zonglian)
**Imperial Guards Division (Zaifeng, Prince Chun)

==Beiyang clique in power (1912–1915)==
Yuan Shikai was sworn in as the provisional president of the Republic of China on 10 March 1912, but there was no agreement among the different political forces in China about the exact form of government the new republic would have or how political power should be divided. One of the disputes that emerged was on the question of federalism, between supporters of autonomy for the provinces and those who wanted a strong central government. The disagreement was made more complicated by the decentralized command structure of the former Qing dynasty&#x27;s military forces, and their involvement in the 1911 Revolution set a precedent for the army to a have larger role in politics. As president, Yuan Shikai took actions to create a strong national government at the expense of the provinces and to create a strong presidency. He attempted to limit the power of revolutionary military governors that had emerged in 1911, and to enforce his decisions he started using the Beiyang Army, which was designated the main &quot;national&quot; army. This designation meant that they were directly controlled by the Ministry of War and were to receive better and more reliable pay, at least in theory.

The first major challenge that Yuan Shikai and the Beiyang generals dealt with was the Second Revolution in 1913. The Kuomintang, supported by revolutionary activists, won the most seats in the election for the National Assembly that began in 1913 and tried to limit the power of the presidency within a parliamentary republic. Yuan moved to protect his power. In March 1913 Kuomintang leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated by his agents, in April he obtained a large foreign loan to fund the Beiyang Army in the event of losing revenue from other provinces, and after that he ordered the governors of the provinces with the largest armies to be removed from office. When he had the Beiyang Army enforce his order in Jiangxi province, Jiangxi declared independence from his administration in July 1913, and this was followed by another six provinces. But the revolutionary forces were weak compared to the Beiyang Army and most of them collapsed before the end of August. At the same time Yuan banned the KMT, issued a constitution creating a powerful presidency, replaced the national parliament, dissolved local parliaments, and removed independent governors who were within the reach of the Beiyang Army. In less than two years after the end of the imperial regime, Yuan Shikai and his subordinates, including both military commanders and government bureaucrats, emerged as the dominant force in Chinese politics. They were referred to as the &quot;Beiyang clique.&quot; They controlled the Beiyang government in Beijing, which remained the internationally recognized government of all of China, but its ability to enforce decisions became dependent on military power and the cooperation of governors and local commanders.
The six divisions of the Beiyang Army, although having the most potential to provide the core of a national army, were not enough for Yuan Shikai to exert power over provinces outside of northern China. As Beiyang generals were sent by Yuan to restore control over other parts of the country, starting with the Second Revolution in 1913, they used their existing troops as cadres to establish new units locally. A typical example of this was Wang Zhanyuan, the commander of the Beiyang 2nd Division, which was sent into Hubei by Yuan Shikai in 1913. Using officers from his unit he was able to raise another division and seven brigades. In addition to these there were the original Hubei provincial troops and more Beiyang forces that later ended up there. After several years, the troops under the command of Wang Zhanyuan numbered over 100,000 men. Even before the outbreak of the Second Revolution, Yuan Shikai started building up between 30,000 and 40,000 Beiyang government troops in Hubei, which were later used to bring central Chinese provinces into his sphere of influence. These included Cao Kun&#x27;s Beiyang 3rd Division and a brigade of the 20th Division from Fengtien. Cao was named commander of the upper Yangtze defenses in 1914, with his forces spread over Hunan and Hubei. Other units were deployed to Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui. 

Another significant change to the Beiyang Army in the early Republic was the end of the Qing practice of rotating officers. Yuan Shikai kept division commanders and their subordinate officers in the same divisions for several years, which enabled them to begin turning their units into a personal network and power base under their control. Yuan&#x27;s relationship with the Beiyang generals and other northern commanders who also became his subordinates was a form of clientelism, and he used his position as president to provide them with power, including increased personal control over military units. Although Yuan planned to create a national army of fifty divisions, and all of China&#x27;s military forces pleged their loyalty to his regime, he was not able to centralize the armed forces within a bureaucratic and less personalized framework. This arrangement functioned effectively as long as Yuan had power, but it began breaking down when in 1915–16 his authority faced a more serious challenge than the Second Revolution had been a couple years earlier. In the rest of the country, outside of his Beiyang and other &quot;central army&quot; forces in northern China, the military command structure remained decentralized, as it had been during the Qing dynasty.
Overall, Duan Qirui and Feng Guozhang emerged as the top commanders of the Beiyang Army besides Yuan himself. Duan became the second most powerful figure in the Beiyang clique by 1914, serving as both Premier and the Minister of War. The latter position gave him more influence over the Beiyang Army because he controlled the promotion of officers. However, in the following year Yuan retook control of the military and removed Duan from his posts. He continued the process of centralizing government power by starting preparations in August 1915 to restore the monarchy in China with himself as emperor. Much of his earlier support was due to him maintaining order, but this was seen as going to far. The monarchical restoration revealed the disagreements among the Beiyang Army&#x27;s high ranking officers. Both Duan and Feng Guozhang, the latter commanding Beiyang forces in Nanjing, openly opposed Yuan&#x27;s decision. Feng&#x27;s headquarters at Nanjing became a meeting point for Beiyang officers that were against the return of the monarchy. 

This was especially a problem for Yuan as the National Protection War broke out, with the province of Yunnan declaring independence from his dictatorship in December 1915, soon followed by Guizhou and others. These provinces had their own forces and were the least influenced by the central government. Their forces launched attacks against the Beiyang Army in Hunan and Sichuan, and the borders of those provinces became the front line. Neither side could gain a clear advantage in the fighting, despite the arrival of Beiyang reinforcements. Cao Kun was appointed the overall commander of the campaign, with his 3rd Division being sent to the Sichuan-Yunnan border. But some of the northern officers were reluctant to fight for Yuan&#x27;s monarchy, and the Beiyang Army was unable to defeat the initial uprising. A local ceasefire was negotiated in Sichuan. Duan Qirui agreed to Yuan&#x27;s request to return to service after he pledged to restore the republic in March 1916. But that was not enough for the rebels, and more provinces declared independence. It became clear the northern forces could not win outright. Beiyang troops ended up abandoning Hunan as the province was taken over by local rebels and the Guangxi provincial army, which happened around the same time that the war was resolved by the death of Yuan Shikai from natural causes in June 1916.

Yuan&#x27;s attempt to make himself emperor began the transition into the Warlord Era. Besides causing the final break between the central government and the military governors in the southern provinces, it created the opportunity for the Beiyang and other northern generals to begin acting independently for their own political interests. They were more concerned with preserving their own power than Yuan&#x27;s position. Examples of these include Wang Zhanyuan in Hubei and Zhang Zuolin in Fengtien, who used their leverage to get Yuan to grant them authority over the civil administration in their provinces, giving them direct control over the funding of their military forces. The reliance on military force by both sides also had the effect of making the already weak civilian institutions of the Beiyang government largely irrelevant.

==Fragmentation of the Beiyang Army (1916–1918)==
The death of Yuan Shikai ended the National Protection War. In Beijing, his vice president and the original revolutionary leader from 1911, Li Yuanhong, took his place as the head of state on 7 June 1916. Li was seen as a potential mediator between the two factions in the war, and he restored the constitution and the National Assembly that Yuan had suppressed, but was unable to resolve the larger question of the distribution of power between the branches of government and the provinces. Duan Qirui and Feng Guozhang became the premier and vice president, due to the importance of the Beiyang Army. Duan assumed command of the Beiyang Army, although there was also a growing rivalry between him and Feng for control. This began to split the Beiyang Army between their respective factions, the Anhui clique and the Zhili clique. The southern provinces remained in a dispute with the Beijing government over constitutional issues, and this began a period of north-south division in China. The northern provinces were under the former Beiyang clique, but neither side was fully unified. Besides Feng, Duan also had to contend with President Li and the parliament. 

In the first half of 1917 the question of China&#x27;s participation in World War I caused a series of events that ended with Duan Qirui seizing full control of the government. Although China had been neutral, following the German announcement of unrestricted submarine warfare and the United States declaring war on Germany in January and February 1917 there was pressure from the U.S. and the Allied Powers for China to enter the war as well. Duan wanted to use this to his advantage, but disputes between him and the parliament prevented this from happening. President Li dismissed Duan as premier in May 1917, causing his military allies to threaten Beijing, while the general Zhang Xun offered to mediate. Duan allowed him to pass through his territory to enter Beijing, but when Zhang declared the restoration of the Qing dynasty on 1 July, the Beiyang Army under Duan quickly captured the city from his troops to end the restoration. Now that Li had been removed and the parliament was dissolved, Duan declared war on Germany on 16 August. He became the premier while Feng replaced Li as president. With the Beiyang Army back in power, they set about restoring control over the south. At the same time Duan was able to reach an agreement with Japan for a loan to fund his government and the Beiyang Army.

Preparations for the Beiyang campaign against the south began in July 1917 when 150,000 troops were moved into Hunan, and another force entered Sichuan. Sun Yat-sen formed an alternative government in Guangzhou, with the backing of some southern warlords, other politicians, and the Chinese Navy. The southern provinces used their armies to resist the Beiyang invasion, with war breaking out as Guangxi and Guangdong clique troops entered Hunan in October to remove the northern forces. Feng Guozhang opposed another civil war, and his call for Duan to end the fighting was joined by the military governors of other central Chinese provinces. Duan&#x27;s field commanders were already reluctant to commit their forces to assert his control over Hunan and withdrew their troops, causing Duan to resign as premier on 16 November 1917. The increasing autonomy of individual commanders within the &quot;national&quot; Beiyang Army meant that it was no longer an effective centralizing force as it had been during Yuan&#x27;s dictatorship. 

Duan spent the fall of 1917 trying to win support from other Beiyang commanders to continue the war against the south, while the southern movement was also split between the pro-war Sun Yat-sen and those that wanted to negotiate with Beijing. In the meantime, Duan obtained a loan from the Japanese ostensibly to build a &quot;War Participation Army&quot; for World War I, but used the funds to strengthen his domestic position. He figured that he could use the new force he was building up near Beijing to influence politics in the capital. Wu Peifu and Zhang Jingyao led a successful takeover of Hunan in March and April 1918 with 150,000 troops, but Wu felt his achievement was not rewarded by Duan and refused to advance further. Wu&#x27;s superior Cao Kun, who controlled an important section of the Beijing–Hankou railway used to move troops from north China to the front in Hunan, remained neutral. This effectively ended the north–south war, beginning the stage of internal power struggles in both the Beiyang Army and the southern forces.

==High warlordism (1919–1925)==

After the initial failure of the Hunan and Sichuan campaigns in late 1917, the Anhui and Zhili cliques engaged in backroom intrigue over who would control the presidency and the premiership in Beijing. Duan returned as premier in March 1918 and his allies in the Anfu Club dominated the newly reconvened parliament, though it fell apart into factional infighting. The other major disagreement between the Zhili and Anhui cliques was on national reunification, with Duan calling on Feng to invade the south using the Zhili clique forces in central China, while Feng, Cao Kun, and Wu Peifu saw this as an attempt by Duan to extend his power and wanted to negotiate with the south. Although Duan resigned again in October 1918, he still controlled the government in Beijing through his political allies. The Anhui clique also received the support of Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s pro-Japanese Fengtian clique in Manchuria, in exchange for allowing Zhang to extend his power over the other two provinces of northeast China. Duan&#x27;s continued building up of his army with Japanese help caused increasing hostility from the Zhili clique, especially after the Chinese public learned that Japan received Germany&#x27;s former concession in Shandong at the Paris Peace Conference in large part because Duan effectively accepted this by signing secret agreements with Japan to receive their support in 1917–18. Cao Kun took over the leadership of the Zhili clique after Feng&#x27;s death in 1919. When Duan decided to send troops into Mongolia, this also aggravated Zhang Zuolin, causing him and Cao to issue an ultimatum to Duan, which was rejected. 

In response to Duan&#x27;s rejection, Wu Peifu began moving troops north from Hunan, marking the start of the Zhili–Anhui War. At this point the Beiyang Army was fully split into two forces: the Anhui clique and the Zhili clique. The total number of soldiers between them and other factions in north China was estimated to be 536,000 in 1919. The Anhui clique was considered the strongest military force in China, and was also called the National Stabilization Army starting in 1920. It was initially organized in five divisions and four mixed brigades, consisting of an estimated 212,000 troops, and received supplies and training from the Japanese. The four brigades formed the Northwest Frontier Guard, which was used for the Chinese occupation of Mongolia in 1919. 

The Zhili clique, initially consisting of Feng&#x27;s 20,000 troops, later expanded, including with Cao Kun&#x27;s Beiyang 3rd Division, in addition to several other units. By 1924 the Zhili clique army would include 250,000 soldiers. The 3rd Division, one of the original Beiyang divisions, was among the most elite of the warlord units and remained the power base of Cao Kun until his defeat in 1924. Feng Guozhang commanded the Imperial Guards Division of the former Qing, consisting of an even mix of Manchu Bannermen and Han soldiers, which the republican government had promised to maintain in its agreement with the imperial household. It became part of Feng&#x27;s own power base along with the 15th Division, joining him in Nanjing in 1917 before returning to Beijing when Feng became president, now as his presidential guard. The guards were redesignated as the 16th Division of the &quot;national&quot; army and fought in several warlord conflicts before being disbanded in 1922. However, one regiment of the Manchu imperial guards stayed in Beijing and remained on duty at the Forbidden City as of 1924.
The Anhui–Zhili War lasted for five days in July 1920 and resulted in a decsive defeat for Duan&#x27;s Japanese-backed forces. The Anhui clique, having controlled a vast territory in northern China and on the eastern coast, was reduced to only the southeastern provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, while the Zhili clique was now in possession of most of northern and central China. The Fengtian clique also advanced into Inner Mongolia. Despite this, the Anfu Club still controlled the Beijing civilian government, with the Beiyang Army veteran Xu Shichang as president. Zhang Zuolin successfully had one of his allies installed as premier in late 1921, leading to tensions between him and the Zhili clique, which accused of him of treason. The First Zhili–Fengtian War occurred in the spring and summer of 1922 when Zhang moved his troops into Beijing, but they were defeated and forced to withdraw to Manchuria, leaving the Zhili clique as the dominant warlord faction in northern and central China. Cao Kun forced the resignation of President Xu and had Li Yuanhong installed as president in June 1922, but he was only in office until October 1923, when he was forced out and a bribed parliament elected Cao Kun as president. 

Cao Kun&#x27;s &quot;election&quot; ended what legitimacy the Beiyang government had left, and he was not recognized by the southern government, the Fengtian clique, or the Anhui clique holdouts. The three other factions formed an alliance against the Zhili clique, and Cao Kun&#x27;s interests began diverging from one of his generals, Wu Peifu. His government was unpopular in the regions that it ruled. When the Zhili clique attempted to invade the remnants of the Anhui clique in September 1924, this triggered their alliances with Zhang Zuolin and Sun Yat-sen, beginning the Second Zhili–Fengtian War. The Zhili clique army, which had been expanded in 1920 and 1922 by absorbing some of the defeated Anhui and Fengtian forces, became involved in attritional warfare against the Anhui, but in October one of the Zhili generals betrayed the clique. Feng Yuxiang overthrew Cao Kun in a coup, having made a deal with Zhang Zuolin, and they replaced Cao with Duan Qirui as a figurehead. Duan remained in office until finally retiring in 1926. The Fengtian clique then expanded its territory into north and central China during 1925, though Sun Chuanfang of the Zhili clique maintained control in the Yangtze river valley, and the alliance between Zhang and Feng broke down in the fall of that year. In 1926 Zhang temporarily allied himself with Wu Peifu to fight Feng, but they eventually also turned on each other.

The constant infighting among the former Beiyang Army warlords in the north damaged their forces and distracted from developments in south China, where Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Kuomintang emerged as a significant force and formed its own National Revolutionary Army. The willingness of certain northern warlords, such as Feng Yuxiang, to ally themselves with the Kuomintang were critical to their decision in July 1926 to begin the Northern Expedition as a national reunification campaign out of their revolutionary base in the province of Guangdong.

==The Northern Expedition (1926–1928)==

The National Revolutionary Army had been established as a Soviet-style party army in southern China in 1924 by the Kuomintang, with the support of Soviet military advisors, and by the spring of 1926 it was capable of fielding several divisions. After the death of Sun Yat-sen in March 1925 he was succeeded by Chiang Kai-shek as both the military and political leader of the KMT. He led the NRA against the warlord forces, taking over much of central China, including the economically prosperous Yangtze river valley, in early 1927. Among the former Beiyang Army warlords, Sun Chuanfang and Wu Peifu chose to fight against the Northern Expedition, while Feng Yuxiang allied himself with the Kuomintang. In response to the Nationalist advance in central China, Zhang Zuolin formed the National Pacification Army as an alliance of warlord forces in the north. Its main component was Zhang&#x27;s Fengtian clique with 350,000 men, which was equipped with tanks and aircraft, and other forces included Sun Chuanfang&#x27;s 200,000 men in central China and Zhang Zongchang&#x27;s 150,000 in Shandong.

In the spring of 1928, Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s forces were pushed back and forced to retreat into Manchuria. The National Revolutionary Army entered Beijing on 6 June 1928. The victory of the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition represented the end of the Beiyang Army and the dominance of the warlords, with many of the warlord forces being absorbed into the National Revolutionary Army. However, some of the warlords remained in command of their forces by making an alliance with the Kuomintang, and they were nominally under the control of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist government. This situation persisted right up until the Chinese Communist takeover 1949.

==Ranks and insignia==

===Officers===
The officers for the Beiyang Army were drawn from the literate and educated class. In the early 1900s an increasing number of officers were from the military schools that Yuan Shikai had established, such as the Baoding Military Academy, though about half of them were from military schools in other parts of China or had been trained in Japan. In later decades the Baoding Military Academy produced the majority of the Beiyang Army officer corps.

===Enlisted soldiers===
During the Qing dynasty, the Beiyang Army recruits were mostly from the peasant class, and although there was no official government conscription some of them had been drafted.

<text>Johann Hermann Schein (20 January 1586 – 19 November 1630) was a German composer of the early Baroque era. He was Thomaskantor in Leipzig from 1615 to 1630. He was one of the first to import the early Italian stylistic innovations into German music, and was one of the most polished composers of the period.

==Biography==
Schein was born in Grünhain. On the death of his father, Schein moved to Dresden where he joined the choir of the Elector of Saxony as a boy soprano. In addition to singing in the choir, he received a thorough musical training with Rogier Michael, the &quot;Kapellmeister,&quot; who recognized his extraordinary talent. From 1603 to 1607 he studied at Pforta, and from 1608 to 1612 attended the University of Leipzig, where he studied law in addition to liberal arts. Upon graduating, he was employed briefly by Gottfried von Wolffersdorff as the house music director and tutor to his children; later he became &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at Weimar, and shortly thereafter became Thomaskantor, music director in Leipzig, especially cantor at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig and conducting the Thomanerchor, a post which he held for the rest of his life.

Unlike his friend Heinrich Schütz, he was afflicted with poor health, and was not to live a happy or long life. His wife died in childbirth; four of his five children died in infancy; he died in Leipzig at age 44, having suffered from tuberculosis, gout, scurvy, and a kidney disorder.

==Style==
Schein was one of the first to absorb the innovations of the Italian Baroque—monody, the concertato style, figured bass—and use them effectively in a German Lutheran context. While Schütz made more than one trip to Italy, Schein apparently spent his entire life in Germany, making his grasp of the Italianate style all the more remarkable. His early concertato music seems to have been modeled on Lodovico Grossi da Viadana&#x27;s &quot;Cento concerti ecclesiastici&quot;, which were available in an edition prepared in Germany.

Unlike Schütz, who concentrated mainly on sacred music (although it must be borne in mind that at least two operas composed by him, among other secular works, have been lost), Schein wrote sacred and secular music in approximately equal quantities, and almost all of it was vocal. In his secular vocal music he wrote all of his own texts. Throughout his life he published alternating collections of sacred and secular music, in accordance with an intention he stated early on — in the preface to the &quot;Banchetto musicale&quot; — to publish alternately music for use in worship and social gatherings. The contrast between the two kinds of music can be quite extreme. While some of his sacred music uses the most sophisticated techniques of the Italian madrigal for a devotional purpose, such as the motet &quot;Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen&quot; setting verses from Psalm 84, several of his secular collections include such things as drinking songs of a surprising simplicity and humor. Some of his works attain an expressive intensity matched in Germany only by those of Schütz, for example the spectacular &quot;Fontana d&#x27;Israel&quot; or &quot;Israel&#x27;s Brünnlein&quot; (1623), in which Schein declared his intent to exhaust the possibilities of German word-painting &quot;in the style of the Italian madrigal.&quot;

Possibly his most famous collection was his only collection of instrumental music, the &quot;Banchetto musicale&quot; (&quot;Musical banquet&quot;) (1617) which contains twenty separate variation suites; they are among the earliest, and most perfect, representatives of the form. Most likely they were composed as dinner music for the courts of Weissenfels and Weimar, and were intended to be performed on viols. They consist of dances: a pavan-galliard (a normal early Baroque pair), a courante, and then an allemande-tripla. Each suite in the &quot;Banchetto&quot; is unified by mode as well as by theme.

<text>A narrative ballet, also known as classical ballet or story ballet is a form of ballet that has a plot and characters. It is typically a production with full sets and costumes. It was an invention of the eighteenth century.

Most romantic and classical ballets of the 19th century were narrative ballets. Among the most well known are &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella&quot;. For these and other classic narrative ballets it is common for ballet directors to create their own choreography, while maintaining the plot and music used by the original 19th-century choreographer. Kenneth MacMillan and Frederick Ashton were neoclassical ballet choreographers that created original narrative ballets in the 20th century.

Plots frequently revolve around intense love, expression, fantasy, and tragedy. The most popular classic ballets are based on fairytales and magical myths.

For example, in &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, the main character Odette is put under a spell by an evil sorcerer that makes her a swan until she turns human at midnight. The spell can only be broken by true love from a man who has not promised his heart to another. She meets a prince and they both fall in love. In the end, the prince was tricked by the evil sorcerer to propose to his daughter. Destined to be a swan forever, Odette plunges herself into the lake from despair. The prince followers her until the river and they are united for eternity in death.

When performing a story ballet, it not only essential that dancers have good technique but that they have the ability to act. This is because in ballet there are no spoken words. It is the responsibility of the dancer to be able to use their movements and facial expressions to the communicate with the audience, or else the plot isn&#x27;t properly conveyed. The ability to tell a story and how emotion without words is known as &quot;classical mime&quot;, which plays an important role in ballet.

Narrative ballets are essential to a ballet company&#x27;s repertoire, because they tend to generate the highest sales and bring families with children to see the ballet. People enjoy watching an art form where they are transformed into a different world. It&#x27;s entertaining and exciting. Many newer narrative ballets are adapted from familiar stories or literature because they are recognizable to audiences.

Narrative ballets are essential to a ballet company&#x27;s repertoire, because they tend to generate the highest sales and bring families with children to see the ballet. People enjoy watching an art form where they are transformed into a different world. It&#x27;s entertaining and exciting. Many newer narrative ballets are adapted from familiar stories or literature because they are recognizable to audiences. As mentioned above &quot;Swan Lake&quot; is one of the most famous examples of narrative ballet, other famous narrative ballets include: &quot;Giselle, The Nutcracker, Romeo and Juliet, and L&#x27;histoire de Manon.&quot; The story of &quot;Giselle&quot; is a romantic tale of innocent love and betrayal; of philandering Count Albrecht and a trusting peasant maid, Giselle. Although she has a weak heart, Giselle loves to dance. &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; is the story of how a young girl named Clara falls in love with a Nutcracker that magically comes to life and defeats an army of evil rats to save her life. Clara and the nutcracker then travel to the land of the sweets where Clara is introduced to the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier, and beautiful Arabian Princesses, Russian Cossacks, French ballet dancers and even exotic flowers, who all dance in her honor. The ballet Romeo and Juliet follows the same story as the famous Shakespearean play it is based on, the only difference between the two being the medium used is dance rather than acting. Lastly, the ballet &quot;L&#x27;histoire de Manon&quot; follows the love story of Manon and Grieux and their search for love and fortune.

==Other forms of ballet==
While narrative ballet is easily the most well-known and appreciated form of ballet, there are many others that are important as well. There are considered to be four main styles of ballet: Classical, Neoclassical, Contemporary, and Romantic. Neoclassical ballet evolved from classical ballet, distinguishing itself for typically being abstract. The music of choice tends to be neoclassical as well, from musicians such as Roussel and Stravinsky. Contemporary ballet takes inspiration from classical ballet elements and adding modern techniques of jazz and other dance forms, and focuses more on athleticism and bigger and swifter tempos. Finally the last style of ballet is Romantic, which is very similar to Classical ballet in the fact that drama, emotion, and a strong storytelling are key components of the style. The main difference between the two styles lies within the costuming. The longer bell-shaped skirts of Romantic ballets are a far cry from the short, stiff, platter-style tutus worn in Classical pieces.

==Creating narrative ballets in the 21st century==

Christopher Wheeldon, composer of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, states that in today&#x27;s age, &quot;Design and the use of technology are important tools in storytelling... such as the well integrated use of projection in his ballet &#x27;Alice&#x27; and &#x27;Winter&#x27;s tale&#x27;&quot;. While we love the classics such as &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella&quot;, modern ballets should reflect the modern days changing technology. While classic ballets are interesting to the audience because of its unique plot and characters, it&#x27;s a good idea to make minor tweak to the original work to hold the audiences&#x27; attention. This could mean adding a new character or making changes to a character&#x27;s costume. However, any changes need to still reflect the original storyline. For example, costumes need to be appealing and reflect a character&#x27;s personality. The lighting and staging needs to complement the storyline to keep it engaging.

<text>Henri Lefebvre ( ; ; 16 June 1901 – 29 June 1991) was a French Marxist philosopher and sociologist, best known for furthering the critique of everyday life, for introducing the concepts of the right to the city and the production of social space, and for his work on dialectical materialism, alienation, and criticism of Stalinism, existentialism, and structuralism. In his prolific career, Lefebvre wrote more than sixty books and three hundred articles. He founded or took part in the founding of several intellectual and academic journals such as &quot;Philosophies&quot;, &quot;La Revue Marxiste&quot;, &quot;Arguments&quot;, &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot;, and &quot;Espaces et Sociétés&quot;.

==Biography==
Lefebvre was born in Hagetmau, Landes, France. He studied philosophy at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne), graduating in 1920. By 1924 he was working with Paul Nizan, Norbert Guterman, Georges Friedmann, Georges Politzer, and Pierre Morhange in the &quot;Philosophies&quot; group seeking a &quot;philosophical revolution&quot;. This brought them into contact with the Surrealists, Dadaists, and other groups, before they moved towards the French Communist Party (PCF).

Lefebvre joined the PCF in 1928 and became one of the most prominent French Marxist intellectuals during the second quarter of the 20th century, before joining the French resistance. From 1944 to 1949, he was the director of &quot;Radiodiffusion Française&quot;, a French radio broadcaster in Toulouse. Among his works was a highly influential, anti-Stalinist text on dialectics called &quot;Dialectical Materialism&quot; (1940). Seven years later, Lefebvre published his first volume of &quot;The Critique of Everyday Life&quot;. His early work on method was applauded and borrowed centrally by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; (1960). During Lefebvre&#x27;s thirty-year stint with the PCF, he was chosen to publish critical attacks on opposed theorists, especially existentialists like Sartre and Lefebvre&#x27;s former colleague Nizan, only to intentionally get himself expelled from the party for his own heterodox theoretical and political opinions in the late 1950s. He then went from serving as a primary intellectual for the PCF to becoming one of France&#x27;s most important critics of the PCF&#x27;s politics (e.g. immediately, the lack of an opinion on Algeria, and more generally, the partial apologism for and continuation of Stalinism) and intellectual thought (i.e. structuralism, especially the work of Louis Althusser).

In 1961, Lefebvre became professor of sociology at the University of Strasbourg, before joining the faculty at the new university at Nanterre in 1965. He was one of the most respected professors, and he had influenced and analysed the May 1968 student revolt. Lefebvre introduced the concept of the right to the city in his 1968 book &quot;Le Droit à la ville&quot; (the publication of the book predates the May 1968 revolts which took place in many French cities). Following the publication of this book, Lefebvre wrote several influential works on cities, urbanism, and space, including &quot;The Production of Space&quot; (1974), which became one of the most influential and heavily cited works of urban theory. By the 1970s, Lefebvre had also published some of the first critical statements on the work of post-structuralists, especially Michel Foucault. During the following years he was involved in the editorial group of &quot;Arguments&quot;, a New Left magazine which largely served to enable the French public to familiarize themselves with Central European revisionism.

Lefebvre died in 1991. In his obituary, &quot;Radical Philosophy&quot; magazine honored his long and complex career and influence:
==Critique of everyday life==

One of Lefebvre&#x27;s most important contributions to social thought is the idea of the &quot;critique of everyday life&quot;, which he pioneered in the 1930s. Lefebvre defined everyday life dialectically as the intersection of &quot;illusion and truth, power and helplessness; the intersection of the sector man controls and the sector he does not control&quot;, and is where the perpetually transformative conflict occurs between diverse, specific rhythms: the body&#x27;s polyrhythmic bundles of natural rhythms, physiological (natural) rhythms, and social rhythms (Lefebvre and Régulier, 1985: 73). The everyday was, in short, the space in which all life occurred, and between which all fragmented activities took place. It was the residual. While the theme presented itself in many works, it was most notably outlined in his eponymous three-volume study, which came out in individual installments, decades apart, in 1947, 1961, and 1981.

Lefebvre argued that everyday life was an underdeveloped sector compared to technology and production, and moreover that in the mid 20th century, capitalism changed such that everyday life was to be colonized. In this zone of everydayness (boredom) shared by everyone in society regardless of class or specialty, autocritique of everyday realities of boredom vs. societal promises of free time and leisure, could lead to people understanding and then revolutionizing their everyday lives. This was essential to Lefebvre because everyday life was where he saw capitalism surviving and reproducing itself. Without revolutionizing everyday life, capitalism would continue to diminish the quality of everyday life, and inhibit real self-expression. The critique of everyday life was crucial because it was for him only through the development of the conditions of human life—rather than abstract control of productive forces—that humans could reach a concrete utopian existence.

Lefebvre&#x27;s work on everyday life was heavily influential in French theory, particularly for the Situationists, as well as in politics (e.g. for the May 1968 student revolts). The third volume has also recently influenced scholars writing about digital technology and information in the present day, since it has a section dealing with this topic at length, including analysis of the (1977); key aspects of information theory; and other general discussion of the &quot;colonisation&quot; of everyday life through information communication technologies as &quot;devices&quot; or &quot;services&quot;.

==Social production of space==

Lefebvre dedicated a great deal of his philosophical writings to understanding the importance of (the production of) space in what he called the reproduction of social relations of production. This idea is the central argument in the book &quot;The Survival of Capitalism&quot;, written as a sort of prelude to (1974) (&quot;The Production of Space&quot;).

Lefebvre contends that there are different modes of production of space (i.e. spatialization) from natural space (&#x27;absolute space&#x27;) to more complex spaces and flows whose meaning is produced in a social way (i.e. social space). Lefebvre analyzes each historical mode as a three-part dialectic between everyday practices and perceptions (), representations or theories of space () and the spatial imaginary of the time ().

Lefebvre&#x27;s argument in &quot;The Production of Space&quot; is that space is a social product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. Lefebvre argued that every society—and, therefore, every mode of production—produces a certain space, its own space.

Lefebvre&#x27;s concept has been criticised: e.g. in &quot;The Urban Question&quot;, Manuel Castells. Many responses to Castells are provided in &quot;The Survival of Capitalism&quot;, and some such as Andy Merrifield argue that the acceptance of those critiques in the academic world would be a motive for Lefebvre&#x27;s effort in writing the long and theoretically dense &quot;The Production of Space&quot;. In &quot;Actually-Existing Success: Economics, Aesthetics, and the Specificity of (Still-)Socialist Urbanism,&quot; Michal Murawski critiques Lefebvre&#x27;s dismissal of actually existing socialism by showing how socialist states produced differential space.

<text>Fintel is a municipality in the district of Rotenburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany and has about 3,000 inhabitants. It is located on the rivers Fintau and Ruschwede.

== History ==
Fintel belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Bishopric was transformed into the Principality of Verden, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712–1715) - and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Principality, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Principality was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which - after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 - incorporated the Principality in a real union and the Princely territory, including Fintel, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823.

== Politics ==
Fintel is part of the &quot;Samtgemeinde&quot; (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) Fintel, population about 7,000.

<doc id="828954" wikidata="Q61273" url="?curid=828954" title="Heinrich Scheidemann">
<text>Heinrich Scheidemann (ca. 1595 – 1663) was a German organist and composer. He was the best-known composer for the organ in north Germany in the early to mid-17th century, and was an important forerunner of Dieterich Buxtehude and J.S. Bach.

==Life==
He was born in Wöhrden in Holstein. His father was an organist in both Wöhrden and Hamburg, and probably Scheidemann received some early instruction from him. Scheidemann studied with Sweelinck in Amsterdam from 1611 to 1614, and evidently was one of his favorite pupils, since Sweelinck dedicated a canon to him, prior to Scheidemann&#x27;s return to Germany. By 1629, and possibly earlier, Scheidemann was in Hamburg as organist at the Catharinenkirche, a position which he held for more than thirty years, until his death in Hamburg in early 1663 during an outbreak of the plague.

==Music and influence==

Scheidemann was renowned as an organist and composer, as evidenced by the wide distribution of his works; more organ music by Scheidemann survives than by any other composer of the time. Unlike the other early Baroque German composers, such as Praetorius, Schütz, Scheidt, and Schein, each of whom wrote in most of the current genres and styles, Scheidemann wrote almost entirely organ music. A few songs survive, as well as some harpsichord pieces, but they are dwarfed by the dozens of organ pieces, many in multiple movements.

Scheidemann&#x27;s lasting contribution to the organ literature, and to Baroque music in general, was in his settings of Lutheran chorales, which were of three general types: cantus firmus chorale arrangements, which were an early type of chorale prelude; &quot;monodic&quot; chorale arrangements, which imitated the current style of monody—a vocal solo over basso continuo—but for solo organ; and elaborate chorale fantasias, which were a new invention, founded on the keyboard style of Sweelinck but using the full resources of the developing German Baroque organ. In addition to his chorale arrangements, he also wrote important arrangements of the Magnificat, which are not only in multiple parts but are in cyclic form towards liturgical use in alternation with the choir during the so-called Vespers, a technique in multiple-movement musical construction which was not to return with vigor until the 19th century. Among his students were Johann Adam Reincken, his successor at the St. Catharine Church in Hamburg, and (possibly) Dieterich Buxtehude.

<doc id="828968" wikidata="Q4997646" url="?curid=828968" title="Bunghole">
<text>A bunghole is a hole bored in a liquid-tight barrel to remove contents. The hole is capped with a cork or cork-like stopper called a &quot;bung&quot;. Acceptable usage includes other access points that may be capped with alternate materials providing an air- or water-tight access to other vessels. For example, a bunghole on a combustion chamber can be used to remove slag or add coal. Bungholes can also be utilized to insert and remove sensing probes or equipment like mixers to agitate the contents within a vessel.

==History and usage==
Bungholes were first used on wooden barrels, and were typically bored by the purchaser of the barrel using a brace and bit. Bungholes can be bored in either head (end) of a barrel or in one of the staves (side). With the bung removed, a tapered faucet can be attached to aid with dispensing. When barrels full of a commodity were shipped, the recipient would often bore new bungholes of the most suitable size and placement rather than remove the existing bung. Wooden barrels manufactured by specialty firms today usually are bored by the maker with suitable bungholes, since the hobbyists who purchase them for the making of beer, wine, and fermented foods often do not have a suitable brace and bit.

Closed-head steel barrels and drums now used for shipment of chemicals and petroleum products have a standardized bunghole arrangement, with one 2 inch NPT and one 3/4 inch NPT threaded bunghole on opposite sides of the top head. Some steel barrels are also equipped with a 2-inch threaded bunghole on the side.

==In literature==
A notable use of the term occurs in Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Hamlet&quot;: While holding the skull of the dead court jester, Hamlet wonders:
To what base uses we may return Horatio. Why, may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bunghole? … Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust, the dust is earth, of earth we make loam, and why of that loam (whereto he was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel? — &quot;Hamlet&quot;, act V, scene 1

==Slang usage==
Usage of the term as a slang word for the anus dates back to at least the 17th century, as shown in Thomas Urquhart&#x27;s translation of &quot;Gargantua&quot; by François Rabelais, first published in 1653. &quot;... I say and maintain, that of all torcheculs, arsewisps, bumfodders, tail-napkins, bunghole cleansers, and wipe-breeches, there is none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose ...&quot;

===In popular culture===
*It was popularized in the MTV cartoon series &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;, the term &quot;bunghole&quot; is used as both a personal insult and slang for anus. In his Cornholio persona, Beavis says, &quot;I need TP for my bunghole.&quot;
*U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson was recorded using the word &quot;bunghole&quot; while ordering slacks over the phone.

===In the meat industry===
Bung dropper is a device inserted into the rectum of a slaughtered animal, mostly of a pig, to separate it from carcass during the dressing process.

<text>William D. Stewart (1941 – June 20, 1979) was an American journalist with ABC News who was murdered by Nicaraguan government National Guard (&quot;Guardia&quot;) forces while reporting on the Nicaraguan Revolution as Sandinista rebel forces were closing in on the capital city of Managua in 1979. Footage of his execution was repeatedly broadcast on network television, resulting in an uproar in the United States against the Somoza regime.

== Life and career ==

Stewart was from West Virginia and was a 1963 graduate of Ohio State University. While at Ohio State, he was active in many extracurricular activities including the Student Senate and the Sphinx honorary society, as well as a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He came to ABC News from WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. He was an experienced foreign correspondent, and his assignments included coverage of the Iranian Revolution in February 1979. He had been in Nicaragua for 10 days reporting on the civil war between the Somoza dynasty and the leftist Sandinistas.

== Death ==

On June 20, 1979, Stewart was traveling in a press van in the eastern slums of the capital city of Managua with his camera and sound crew when they were stopped at a roadblock run by the Nicaraguan Guardia, President Anastasio Somoza Debayle&#x27;s main force. The van was clearly marked as a press vehicle as a precaution, which had become standard practice as the insurgency and revolution increased in intensity. On the previous day, the government newspaper &quot;Novedades&quot; had run an editorial describing foreign journalists as &quot;part of the vast network of communist propaganda&quot;.

Stewart and his 26-year-old Nicaraguan interpreter Juan Francisco Espinoza exited the vehicle and approached the barricade. Stewart presented official press credentials issued by the office of the Nicaraguan president. When they were a few meters away from the soldiers, cameraman Jack Clark began filming from inside the van. A guardsman ordered the men to separate, and Stewart was ordered first to kneel and then to lie face down on the ground. A soldier approached him, kicked him once in the ribs, then stepped back and shot him behind his right ear, killing him instantly. Espinoza was shot to death off-camera by a different soldier, apparently before Stewart was killed, after he approached the guards to ask their permission for an interview. Pablo Tiffer López was driving the ABC van, and he testified that a soldier remarked of Stewart, &quot;I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s no journalist. He&#x27;s a dog.&quot; He also testified that the soldiers commanded the news crew to report that a Sandinista sniper was responsible.

Stewart was 37 years old. He was survived by his wife Myrna and his parents. His body was retrieved by his crew and flown on a U.S. Air Force C-130 from Nicaragua to Panama, then transferred to an airplane sent by ABC and returned to the United States. He was buried in Ashland, Kentucky.

== Impact ==
The news crew smuggled the footage out of the country and sent it to New York. ABC, NBC, and CBS all ran it on their evening news broadcasts and repeatedly rebroadcast it in the following days. Millions of viewers in the United States and worldwide reacted with shock and outrage toward the Somoza regime. All three networks protested the killings by withdrawing their personnel from the country, with only CBS leaving a single correspondent to cover the conflict. President Jimmy Carter issued a statement describing the murder as &quot;an act of barbarism that all civilized people condemn.&quot;

Shortly after the killings, the Nicaraguan national guard reported that they had arrested Corporal Lorenzo Brenes (&quot;Brenis&quot; in some reports), who they said was the soldier responsible for Stewart&#x27;s murder, and that he would be &quot;brought before legal officers&quot;. Brenes had been in command of the roadblock, and he testified before a military tribunal that he had not witnessed the shootings. He said that Stewart&#x27;s killer was a &quot;Private González&quot; who was killed in combat later the same day. Brenes testified that the private related to him that he had killed Stewart &quot;because he tried to run away&quot;. The ultimate fates of the &quot;Guardia&quot; soldiers responsible for the killings of Stewart and Espinoza are not known, due to the chaotic demise of the Somoza regime. Somoza fled Nicaragua for Miami on July 17, and the regime was overthrown on July 19, 1979, less than a month after Stewart&#x27;s murder.

==Legacy==
Footage of the incident appeared in the film &quot;Days of Fury&quot; (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price. The footage was also used in &quot;From the Ashes: Nicaragua Today&quot;, a documentary released in 1983.

A fictional version of Stewart&#x27;s murder was told in the 1983 film &quot;Under Fire&quot;, starring Gene Hackman, Nick Nolte, and Joanna Cassidy. Hackman&#x27;s Alex Grazier and Nolte&#x27;s Russell Price are amalgamations of Bill Stewart&#x27;s life and career as a journalist and war correspondent. In the film, Stewart&#x27;s death is presented differently: Hackman&#x27;s character is shot in the chest while standing up, and his death is captured in a series of still images by Nolte&#x27;s character, who escapes from the scene in a hail of gunfire. As in Stewart&#x27;s case, the images are shown to television audiences around the world, and the public outcry signals the end for the embattled Somoza dictatorship.

After the fall of Somoza, the new Sandinista government created a park in Stewart&#x27;s honor in Managua. The park, established at the site in Barrio Riguero where he was killed, featured a cement monument and a plaque with the inscription &quot;In memory of Bill Stewart. He did not die in a strange land, and we will cherish his memory because he is part of Free Nicaragua.&quot; By 1984, the park had fallen into disrepair as the government diverted funds from municipal budgets to the war effort against the Contras, and the park was maintained only by the volunteer Ricardo Gonzalez, an elderly man who lived nearby and witnessed Stewart&#x27;s murder. That year the American internationalist engineer Ben Linder, who lived in the area, and American nun Nancy Hanson persuaded the Committee of U.S. Citizens Living in Nicaragua to donate tools to Gonzalez and pay him a monthly stipend for his work. In 1987, Bill Stewart Park was described as &quot;not unlike the hundreds of street-corner memorials that pay tribute to neighborhood martyrs of the insurrection.&quot;

Joan Kruckewitt in &quot;The Death of Ben Linder&quot; provides an account of Stewart&#x27;s death and its impact, as well as the creation and maintenance of Bill Stewart Park.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz GLE, formerly Mercedes-Benz M-Class (designated with the &quot;ML&quot; nomenclature), is a mid-size luxury SUV produced by the German manufacturer Mercedes-Benz since 1997. In terms of size, it is slotted in between the smaller GLC and the larger GLS, the latter with which it shares platforms.

The first-generation M-Class, designated with the model code W163, is a body-on-frame SUV and was produced until 2004. The second-generation M-Class (W164) moved to a unibody platform while sharing most components with the GL-Class, which sports a longer body to accommodate third-row seating.

For a short time, between 1999 and 2002, the W163 M-Class was also built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, for the European market, and the W166 M-Class from 2011 to 2015 was built in Stuttgart for the European and Australian market, before all production moved to the U.S. plant near Vance, Alabama in 2015 with the release of the facelifted W166 model, in an effort to harmonize Mercedes-Benz SUV nameplates by aligning it with the E-Class.

== Nomenclature update from M to GLE ==
Although grouped under the &quot;M-Class&quot; naming banner since the first launch, BMW, who sells M models such as the M3, objected to the car being badged &quot;M&quot; with the three-digit engine level afterwards (e.g. M 320). This forced Mercedes-Benz to defer to a double-tiered marketing strategy of &quot;ML&quot; badging (e.g. ML 320) under an M-Class umbrella. There has been some confusion surrounding this nomenclature, with many sources erroneously referring to the series as the &quot;ML-Class&quot;, including Mercedes-Benz itself.

From 2015, with the release of the facelifted W166 third-generation model at the New York Auto Show in April, the M-Class was renamed to GLE as per the revised nomenclature adopted by the brand. Under this scheme, SUVs use the base name &quot;GL&quot;, followed by the model&#x27;s placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The &quot;G&quot; is for Geländewagen (German for off land wagon or off-road vehicle) and alludes the long-running G-Wagen. This is followed by the letter &quot;L&quot; that acts as a linkage with the letter &quot;E&quot;—the GLE being the SUV equivalent to the E-Class.

== First generation (W163; 1997) ==

=== Development ===
Mercedes-Benz proposed a plan to replace the G-Class, which at the time had been in production for 11 years. A joint agreement with Mitsubishi Motors to develop and produce a sports-utility vehicle was made in early 1991 and was confirmed publicly that June. Plans were made to base it on the Montero/Pajero platform, with one of them being badged as a Mercedes-Benz and the other a Mitsubishi. In May 1992, these plans were abandoned citing &quot;technical problems&quot; and Mercedes-Benz continued on with in-house development from January 1993.

In March 1993, a search for a location to build a U.S. manufacturing plant began. By September 1993, a location in the state of Alabama was chosen and construction started in 1994.

While plans were being made overseas, in Germany development continued. Design work took place from late 1992 to 1994. A design from Mercedes&#x27; Sindelfingen studio was chosen in 1993 and approved by the executive board in February 1994. The design patents were filed in Germany on 13 July 1994, and in the U.S. on 13 January 1995. Prototype testing started with test mules and crash tests using mock-ups in May 1994. First functional prototype&#x27;s crash test took place in February 1995, with full testing run from March 1995 to December 1996 in various climates and regions of the world. Pilot production began in May 1996.

In July 1996, construction on the Mercedes-Benz U.S. International plant in Vance, Alabama concluded, with the very first production M-Class rolling off the assembly line the week of 9 February 1997.

=== Launch ===
Mercedes-Benz launched the first generation W163 series M-Class on 19 February 1997, in the United States for the 1998 model year, with sales beginning that September. It is a mid-sized body-on-frame SUV with seating for five, or seven with an optional third-row, seven-seat version. Access to the third-row was deemed problematic and the seats were not suitable for large adults. As the result, the seven seater M-Class was discontinued after the 2005 model year and replaced by the larger GL-Class.

The Mercedes-Benz M-Class (W163) was available with permanent 4Matic four-wheel drive, which routed torque to all four wheels through open front, center, and rear differentials. The system used a two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4409 transfer case with a planetary center differential that provides a 48% front/52% rear default torque split. The transfer case featured reduction gearing, and Mercedes&#x27; new &quot;Four-wheel Electronic Traction System&quot; (4-ETS). 4-ETS simulated three differential locks on all three open differentials, via aggressively braking one or more spinning wheels.

The M-Class was the first luxury SUV to feature electronic stability control, a system designed to detect loss of control and instantaneously intervene with selective braking to bring the vehicle back on its intended course. Furthermore, the M-Class boasted front- and side-impact airbags with advanced occupant detection for the front passenger seat, which helped earn the W163 the highest marks in insurance industry crash tests.

Manufactured in Vance, Alabama, in the United States, the M-Class launched in the North American market first as the ML 320. The ML 320 was sold internationally, with the &quot;320&quot; suffix alluding to the 3.2-litre V6 engine. An entry-level, manual transmission-only ML 230, fitted with a 2.3-litre inline-four was available in Europe from launch in March 1998 until 2000. From launch in 1998, European markets also received the ML 270 CDI with a 2.7-litre inline-five turbodiesel engine. This unit was made available in Australia in 2000 and continued on in the W163 until being replaced upon the release of the W164 M-Class in 2005.

Later, in 1998, the more powerful ML 430 became available with the newly introduced Mercedes-Benz 4.3-litre V8. This was followed by the February 1999 debut of the 2000 ML 55 AMG, featuring a 5.4-litre V8 engine made by AMG, modified bodywork, and other performance features.
In September 1996, before the vehicle was launched, Mercedes-Benz allowed the producers of the 1997 film &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; to make use of modified pre-production M-Class SUVs as a way to advertise the W163 when it was launched in 1997. As a result, a Mercedes-Benz advertisement appears before the film on original VHS copies of the film. Jeff Goldblum, the star of the film, received a complimentary ML 320 from Mercedes-Benz as a result of the tie-in. Three versions were used in the movie, two of which of each were built. Two are displayed at the Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, there is one at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany, and one at the Visitor Center at the M-class factory in Alabama.

=== Awards ===
The ML 320 was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Truck of the Year for 1998 and was voted the 1998 North American Truck of the Year at the North American International Auto Show, Detroit, in January 1998. It also received the World Car Award in March 1999, voted by an international jury of automotive journalists in Geneva. Despite the accolades, Mercedes-Benz received considerable criticism with respect to the substandard quality of the W163, resulting in the car being nicknamed &quot;Alabama Trashcan&quot;. Quality improved over the years, especially after the facelift in 2001 for the 2002 model year. DaimlerChrysler spent US$600 million (~$ in ) on improvements at the Alabama factory before launching the second generation ML in 2005.

=== Engines (1997–2005) ===
=== Facelift ===
Mercedes-Benz revised and updated the W163 in 2001 for the 2002 model year. Styling updates involved the fitment of new head- and tail-lamp lenses, front and rear bumpers, new alloy wheels on most variants, the relocation of the side turn signals from the fenders to the side-view mirrors, and various interior trim changes. At the same time, the ML 430 was replaced by the 5.0-litre V8-powered ML 500 and a new 4.0-litre V8 turbodiesel ML 400 CDI became available in Europe. The following year, in 2002, Mercedes-Benz launched the ML 350 fitted with a 3.7-litre V6 engine. The ML 350 replaced the ML 320 in some markets, but supplemented it in others.

The previous Popemobile was based on a W163 series ML 430 and has been in service since July 2002. Volkswagen had offered to build a new vehicle based on the Touareg, but Pope Benedict XVI opted to continue using his predecessor&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz-manufactured vehicle.

== Second generation (W164; 2005) ==
In 1999, development on a successor to the W163 began under the codename &quot;W164&quot; and spanned a period of six years. First design drafts appeared in 2000 with the first models in scale 1:4, and in 2001 three full-sized models were prepared. In 2002 the design styled by Steve Mattin under Peter Pfeiffer was chosen and approved by the executive board. Design patents were filed in Germany on 10 June 2003 and in the U.S. on 25 July. Prototype testing was conducted throughout 2003 and 2004, concluding in early 2005. The redesigned M-class (chassis name &quot;W164&quot;) was introduced in April 2005 as a 2006 model after a showing at the North American International Auto Show in January. It was almost entirely new, with a more sporting, aerodynamic look. The coefficient of drag was reduced to 0.34. Mercedes-Benz made the new M-Class 71 mm larger, 150 mm longer and 5 mm lower than the first model. The M-Class was named &quot;Best New Sport Utility Vehicle&quot; in the 2006 Canadian Car of the Year awards.

Mercedes-Benz extensively publicised the US$600 million spent to update its factory and add manufacturing space for the new R-Class. According to early automotive press reports, the 2006 M-Class vehicles demonstrated vast improvements in quality.

The W164 platform used for the new M-Class is shared with the new GL-Class and is a unibody type rather than the former (W163) body-on-frame used by the M-Class vehicles produced from 1998–2005. The X164 GL-Class, a longer seven-seater version of the W164 platform, is also available.

New features in the 2006 M-Class include the 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission, optional Active Curve-Illuminating Bi-Xenon headlights which &quot;steer&quot; in the path of the vehicle, and an adjustable-height air suspension. The manual transmission has been dropped. Permanent 4Matic four-wheel drive remained, with one-speed transfer case (no low range), center limited-slip differential and four-wheel electronic traction system (4-ETS). In most countries except the U.S., an Off-Road Pro package with center and rear differential locks, 4-ETS, two-speed transfer case with reduction gearing, and adjustable ground clearance was available as an option increasing the original fording depth from 500 mm to 600 mm.

The AMG version of the W164, the ML 63 AMG, was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show as a limited edition 2007 model. It features a 6.2 L &quot;M156&quot; V8 engine producing and that is handcrafted in Germany. The engine is added to an AMG SpeedShift 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission. The 2006 ML 63 AMG can accelerate from in just 4.8 seconds, or from in just 5.0 seconds. These features made the ML 63 AMG the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 SUV in the world at the time of its launch.

=== Facelift ===

By 2007, design work on updates to the W164 were finalized and patented domestically in Germany on 23 November 2007. The 2009 Mercedes-Benz M-Class got a minor facelift as it debuted at the 2008 New York International Auto Show in March 2008.

This facelift includes new front headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, new exterior mirrors, new rim choices, a larger front grille, restyled interior, and a new ML 420 CDI engine choice. The ML 280 CDI became the ML 300 CDI, the 320 CDI became the 350 CDI, and the 420 CDI became the 450 CDI.

Models using Bluetec Diesel engine with urea injection were introduced in 2008 for the 2009 model year.

At the 2009 New York International Auto Show, Mercedes-Benz showed their ML 450 Hybrid SUV, which was announced on 8 April 2009. The ML 450 Hybrid consumes almost 50% less fuel than the ML 550 does, even though it produces over 90% of the power generated by the V8 model. Total power generated will be and of torque, while getting on the highway and in the city, according to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates. The engine itself runs on the Atkinson cycle and by itself makes 275 hp. The ML 450 was developed under the Global Hybrid Cooperation, and will only be available in the United States under lease.

In 2011, Mercedes-Benz came out with their flagship SUV model, the Mercedes-Benz M BlueTec Grand Edition. The vehicle had cosmetic changes, including specially-manufactured 22-inch 10 spoke wheels, black leather with white stitching, and smokers package with Grand Edition modeling. The exterior consisted of new wheels, tinted headlights and tail lights, xenon-package (LED tail lights and daytime running lights, Xenon headlights), black grille, AMG, and side-view mirrors. The Grand Edition was offered in Midnight Blue, Black, and Ivory White, differentiating the basic model by colour already. The interior had changes, including deletion of the heated steering wheel and the replacement with an AMG steering wheel.
===Engines (2005-2011)===
== Third generation (W166/C292; 2011) ==

In 2006, development began on the next-generation M-Class and spanned over a period of 5 years, a shorter duration than its predecessor. In 2008, the final design by Emiel Burki was approved and patented domestically on 16 December 2008 (U.S. design patent filed on 15 June 2009). The newly redesigned M-Class (chassis name &quot;W166&quot;) was introduced in pre-production form 10 June 2011 as a 2012 model. The first customer-designated W166 rolled off the Vance production line on 20 July. It is moderately refined, taking styling cues from the new generation Mercedes-Benz E-Class. An increase in rear seat legroom has been implemented, alongside adjustable rear backrests. It was to be launched in September 2011.

New features in the 2012 M-Class include an updated 7G-Tronic Plus seven-speed automatic transmission to provide improved fuel economy, optional adaptive cruise control (Distronic Plus), active lane departure warning system, and an adjustable-height air suspension (AirMatic). An active curve system with active anti-roll bars for body roll compensation was introduced.

The W166 was one of the last vestiges of the joint venture between Daimler and Chrysler while they were a consolidated company. DaimlerChrysler developed the core platform and technology, benefitting from Chrysler&#x27;s strong SUV sales and R&amp;D domestically. The underlying platform work was largely completed in 2006, as the two companies were separated. Chrysler uses the same platform to power the Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) and Dodge Durango. Because of the separation however, the cars are extremely different in terms of interior and body design as well as engine choices. Aside from engines, the three SUVs share many powertrain components, including some transmissions.

An &quot;On&amp;Off Road Package&quot; is available for most markets (now including North America) as of the 2013 model year. The package adds a two-speed dual range Magna Powertrain transfer case with center differential lock, reduction gearing, underbody skid plates, and a 6-mode selectable terrain driving program system. The rear differential lock has been discontinued.

Open front and rear differentials are fitted, and use four-wheel electronic traction system (4-ETS) to simulate front and rear differential locks.

The Mercedes M-Class won first place in the &quot;Luxury Crossover SUV&quot; category and has been named the most ideal vehicle for Americans based on a study undertaken by California-based automotive research and consulting firm AutoPacific.

Mercedes-Benz India established a manufacturing plant in Chakan, Pune in early 2009 that rolled out the first W166 M-Class to be built outside the US in October 2012. In the following month, Mercedes-Benz Indonesia began M-Class assembly at a factory in Wanaherang, West Java. These plants perform final assembly of vehicles shipped as &quot;knocked-down&quot; kits from Vance, USA.

In the second half of 2015 a facelifted W166 was released as the GLE, along with a coupé version.

The previous Popemobile was based on the 2012 M-Class and was delivered in December 2012.
=== Engines (2012–2019) ===


=== Facelift (GLE) ===
The GLE name was used in 2015 for the facelifted W166 along with the new five-door coupé derivative GLE Coupé (C292) which was unveiled to the public in January 2015 at the North American International Auto Show. As part of Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s new naming strategy, the GLE will define the SUV&#x27;s positioning in the middle of its segment and between the future GLC and GLS (the former GLK and GL, respectively), the same way the E-Class is positioned in relation to the C and S-Classes.

==== Body variants ====
===== SUV (W166) =====
The W166 facelift was unveiled at the New York Auto Show. The GLE 500 e is the first plug-in hybrid in this model range, combining a 333 hp V6 engine with a 116 hp electric motor. The first 19 units were delivered in the American market in June 2016.

===== Coupé (C292) =====
The GLE Coupé (C292) is the coupé SUV version and is heavily related to the W166, sharing its platform, mechanicals and interior (but having a unique body with a similar design). The C292 coupé was unveiled to the public in January 2015 at the North American International Auto Show, it was discontinued in August 2019 after the introduction of the W167.

The GLE Coupé was built in Alabama with the GLE on which it is based. Sales are expected from the second half of 2015. The range is topped by the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 S-Model, powered by 5.5-litre twin turbo V8 producing 585 bhp and 768 Nm of torque, making it one of the quickest in its segment.

== Fourth generation (W167/C167; 2019) ==
The fourth generation GLE was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show.

At launch, the GLE was sold in the U.S. with two engine options. The GLE 350 has a 2-liter 4-cylinder engine with and the GLE 450 has a 3-liter, inline-6, turbocharged engine with and of torque. The GLE 450 has a 48V electric system with an integrated starter motor. The system powers the air-conditioner, in-car electronics and the electronically driven turbocharger. The GLE 450 features a refined Active Body Control system, that does away with mechanical roll bars, notably enhancing performance.

Other engine options are also available. The AMG GLE 53 was introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show in March. It has a 3.0 L turbocharged I6 producing and of torque. A 48V electric system like in the GLE 450 features EQ Boost for an extra and torque on demand.

For the first time under the &quot;GLE&quot; name, the GLE also adds a seven-seat option.

===Plug-in hybrid===
In the European market, two plug-in hybrid versions are available: the GLE 350e, using a petrol engine, and the GLE 350de, using a diesel engine. Both use a 31.2-kWh battery. The vehicle can be equipped with a 60 kW quick charging option. The declared WLTP all-electric range is .

===MY2024 LCI===

For 2024, the GLE receives a facelift, adding completely restyled headlights and taillights. It now has a new steering wheel, restyled bumper, newer wheels and a new trim called GLE450e. It now competes with the facelifted 2024 Porsche Cayenne and facelifted Audi Q8.

===Engines===
=== Recall ===
In March 2024, Mercedes-Benz recalled over 116,000 GLE and GLS cars, built from 2019 to 2024, due to a loose 48-volt ground cable that may not have been tightened properly during assembly. The ground cable is located under the front passenger seat that could pose a potential safety risk when the cables become hot.

<text>The term &quot;fédérés&quot; (; sometimes translated to English as &quot;federates&quot;) most commonly refers to the troops who volunteered for the French National Guard in the summer of 1792 during the French Revolution. The &quot;fédérés&quot; of 1792 effected a transformation of the Guard from a constitutional monarchist force into a republican revolutionary force.

&quot;Fédérés&quot; has several other closely related meanings, also discussed in this article.

==Origin and terminology==

The term &quot;fédérés&quot; derives from the &quot;Fête de la Fédération&quot;, the annual celebration during the revolutionary era, celebrated at the Champ de Mars in Paris on the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789. 
However, the term &quot;fédérés&quot; as used by historians today almost always refers to the volunteer troops of 1792. The third &quot;fête&quot; of 1792 was of a far more radical nature than that of 1790, and prefigured the militant insurrections later in the year.

==1790 celebration==
At the first &quot;fête de la Fédération&quot; in 1790, Talleyrand said Mass, Lafayette addressed the crowd, and King Louis XVI gave a secular sermon. The attendees, known as &quot;fédérés&quot;, came from all over France and brought the spirit of the revolution back to the provinces.

==Provincial militia in Paris – 1792==

In early May, 1792, the Girondin Minister of War Joseph Servan made the proposal to bring armed volunteers from the provinces to Paris. The citizen-soldiers were to be invited to the city for the third &quot;fête&quot;, but they were also intended to become an effective supplement to the regular army. They were to receive military training in Paris and eventually take their place at the frontlines in the French Revolutionary War.

The prospect of thousands of new militiamen descending upon the capital for an indeterminate length of time was a highly contentious one. Some, like the king, saw it as a plot to stack Paris full with anti-monarchists, while others, like Maximilien Robespierre, feared the outsiders might be used as a provincial counterweight to the radical Parisian &quot;sans-culottes&quot;.

King Louis employed his constitutional prerogative to quash the proposal, and this use of the greatly unpopular royal veto was met with a storm of protest from all quarters. In the ensuing political struggle, the king dismissed the entire Girondin ministry. With the government in disarray, radical agitators seized the issue and it rapidly became the source of massive citywide unrest.

Eventually thousands of the provincial volunteers arrived regardless of the king&#x27;s disapproval, and they were given a warm welcome by members of the Legislative Assembly. Robespierre himself, now fully supportive, greeted the provincial “defenders of liberty” as the &quot;last hope of the country.&quot; (Meanwhile, 20,000 Fédérés entered the city for the celebration of 14 July; Pétion was reinstalled.) At the end of July more than 3,000 had entered Paris useful in provoking various measures, notably the overthrow of the king. They were allowed to join the National Guard, and would focus on the &quot;enemy within&quot;. A significant maneuver took place during the night when volunteers from Marseille led by Charles Barbaroux moved into the Cordeliers Convent. On 7 August, Pétion proposed that Robespierre assist in facilitating the departure of Fédérés to pacify the capital, suggesting their more effective service at the front lines.

The &quot;fédérés&quot; issue helped lead to a series of Parisian insurrections throughout the spring and summer, culminating in the assault on the Tuileries Palace on 10 August. The &quot;fédérés&quot; themselves played a large part in the Tuileries assault, and afterwards they contributed further to the climate of republican solidarity by adopting an uncommonly grateful public posture towards the female participants of the Revolution. In a post-victory ceremony, leaders of the &quot;fédérés&quot; honored their female colleagues and awarded civic crowns to three who displayed outstanding conduct in the assault – Louise Reine Audu, Claire Lacombe, and Théroigne de Méricourt.

==Other meanings==

===1815===

The term &quot;Fédérations&quot; was revived during the Cent-Jours. It was an anti-royalist movement intended to repress local revival of monarchists after the flight of the Bourbons.

===1871===

The term &quot;fédérés&quot; was revived during the Paris Commune. The Communards&#x27; Wall is known in French as the &quot;Mur de Fédérés&quot;.

===1964===

*&quot;Fœderatio Internationalis Una Voce&quot;, a federation of Roman Catholic lay organizations founded in 1964.
*&quot;Fœderati&quot;, any one of several outlying nations providing military assistance to ancient Rome in exchange for payment, often in the form of grants of land, serving as monoëthnic units under native leaders (as opposed to traditional polyethnic “auxiliaries” commanded by Roman officers).

<doc id="829047" wikidata="Q911137" url="?curid=829047" title="Mercedes-Benz CL-Class">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz CL-Class is a line of grand tourers which was produced by German automaker Mercedes-Benz, produced from 1992 to 2014. The name CL stands for the German Coupé Luxusklasse (Coupé-Luxury). It is considered by Mercedes as their premier model.

In 2015 Mercedes officially ceased using the CL-Class designation, returning the vehicle&#x27;s name back to the S-Class Coupe/Convertible, replacing it with the C217 S-Class Coupé.

== History ==

The CL-Class is the coupé derivative of the S-Class full-size luxury saloon, upon which it shares the same platform. Formerly known as the SEC (Sonderklasse-Einspritzmotor-Coupé) and later S-Coupé, it was spun off into its own, separate name in 1996 and in 1997 for North American markets. The CL continued to follow the same development cycle as the S, though riding on a shorter wheelbase, and sharing the same engines albeit with less choice as only the higher-output powertrains are offered. The last generation of the CL was actually heavier than its corresponding S trim (considering equivalent equipment), due to the roof engineering required to compensate for the lack of a central B-pillar.
== First generation (C140; 1992–1998) ==


The first generation CL-Class was the sleek but hard-lined and redesigned W140-chassis (internally known as C140) coupé of 1992–1999. Designed by Bruno Sacco, the C140&#x27;s final design was approved between late 1987 and early 1988. Though the coupé&#x27;s physical appearance changed little over these years, the class underwent a name change several times. The V8 and V12 coupés were called the 500 SEC and 600 SEC, respectively, in 1992 and 1993. The 600 SEC was the first V12 coupé ever offered by Mercedes-Benz. For 1994, the model names were changed to the S500 Coupé and the S600 Coupé. The name CL-Class was adopted in June 1996 (1997 for MY1998 North American models), and the W140 coupés were called the CL500 and CL600. Production ended in August 1998.

The M119 5.0 L V8 engine was regarded as one of the best engines ever produced by the German manufacturer (according to various journalists from automobile magazines such as &quot;Car&quot; and &quot;Auto Motor Und Sport&quot;). Being much lighter at the front, the CL500 tended to have better handling characteristics than the heavier V12 flagship. The CL600 powered by the M120 48-valve twelve cylinder engine, developed and of torque.

Twelve cylinder variants are easily identified by the &quot;V12&quot; emblems at the base of each C pillar, placed immediately behind the passenger windows. An entry-level model, the CL420, was available with a 4.2 L V8 engine (with the same architecture as the M119 5.0 L V8 engine) and since it was not available at all markets, it had very low sales compared to its larger-engined siblings. Production ended September 1998 with 26,022 Coupés produced.

== Second generation (C215; 1998–2006) ==


The second generation CL is the C215-chassis four passenger coupé of 1998–2006, with development 1993 to 1999 and final design approved in 1996. It is based on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220) (which was launched in late 1998 in Europe), though it rides on an shorter wheelbase. The CL&#x27;s front fascia of four oval headlights is similar to that of the W210 and W211 E-Class. 

The CL model variants included the: 
* naturally aspirated (NA) V8-powered CL 500 
* NA V8-Powered CL55 AMG, the supercharged V8-powered CL55 AMG 
* NA V12-powered CL 600 (2000–2002)
* limited production (about 200 per year worldwide 5.5 litre V12 Bi-Turbo CL600 (2003–2006)
* limited-edition NA CL63 AMG (26 examples only)
* 2000 NA CL55 AMG F1 Edition (55 examples only)
* the limited production (196 total) 6.0 litre V12 Bi-Turbo CL65 AMG (2004–2006) 

The CL coupés introduced the Active Body Control fully active suspension system and Bi-Xenon HID lights). Active Body Control uses four hydraulic suspension rams that use three pressure regulators connected to a combination power steering and suspension pump, pushing fluid at a pressure of through the system that, along with several intermediate computers and master CPU, keeps this car flat through the corners.
Standard equipment includes climate control, ABC (hydraulic) suspension, all-leather interior, designer wood trim, trip computer, CD, navigation system, front heated seats, power moonroof, as well as power door and trunk closing assist. Optional features include a heated steering wheel and voice-activated telephone, as well as, front fan-cooled and heated seats.

The CL63 AMG was produced only in November 2001 and just 26 examples were sold. The engine produced 438 bhp and 390 lb-ft torque between 2,500 - 5,800 rpm, with a peak of 457 at 4,400 rpm. The V12-powered CL63 AMG was only sold in Europe and Asia. Mercedes-Benz never offered the C215 CL63 for sale; all were sold exclusively through AMG.

Only 55 examples of thee 2000 CL55 AMG F1 were manufactured, as a tribute to the modified Safety Car version used in Formula One during the and seasons. The engine was a naturally-aspirated 5.4-liter V8 delivering 354 bhp at 5,500 rpm, and 391 ft lbs torque at 4,100 rpm. This was the first road car to feature full Ceramic Brembo Vented and Cross Drilled Disc Brakes.

From 2000 through 2002, the V12-equipped cars featured a cylinder deactivation system marketed as Active Cylinder Control, subsequently dropped when the Bi-Turbo V12 was introduced. The deactivation feature allowed improved fuel economy for the CL 600, comparable CL 500, notably during highway driving where six-cylinder operation could activate. The V12 engine is not unlike two Mercedes six-cylinder series engines mated to a common crank with appropriate engine monitoring systems.

Exclusive “Designo” packages featured custom color metallic paint, custom color Nappa leather interior and exotic wood trims, in three variants: Designo Cashmere, Designo Espresso and Designo Silver. Additional variants can be found on rarer models. An optional granite trim could be specified in lieu of wood trim.

In 2003 the engine options changed. The CL 55 AMG became supercharged allowing the car to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.27 sec according to Motor Trend and the V12 CL 600 had 2 turbochargers added and a slight engine reduction, from 5980 cc to 5513 cc. Both cars produced the distinction, again, was the ghost like quietness of the CL 600 as compared to rather noisy CL 55 AMG. The CL 600 was conservatively rated by Mercedes-Benz as not to take sales away from the AMG CL 55. A dyno tested stock CL 600 was closer to 540 hp. Car &amp; Driver&#x27;s acceleration test delivered a 0-60 time of 4.3 seconds. The more powerful CL 65 (2004-2006) produced . The top speed of the CL 65 was limited to . These numbers are the stock performance ratings for the AMG CL 65.

== Third generation (C216; 2006–2014) ==

After 6 years of development, the new model was officially unveiled at the end of June 2006 and was presented at the 2006 Paris Motor Show. Like its predecessors, the C216 has no B-pillar interrupting the sleek curve of the side windows. The W216 is offered in four models, each with its own engine and transmission, the 5.5L V8-powered CL 550 (available with 4MATIC all-wheel drive, which is standard in Canada and the USA), the high-performance 6.2L V8-powered CL 63 AMG (with optional performance package variant) and the ultra-luxury twin-turbo 5.5L V12-powered CL 600 and, lastly, the CL 65 AMG with a twin-turbo 6.0L V12 engine. The CL 500 is sold as the CL 550 in some markets (including the U.S.). The class is based on the chassis of the W221 S-Class, which shares the same powertrains, although there are V6 and hybrid engines for the S not available for the CL. The two-door coupé weighs , being heavier than the equivalent S saloon, and rides on a full-size 116.3-inch wheelbase (albeit 8.2 inches less than the long wheelbase S-Class, which is the only S-Class sold in the U.S.). Despite its large size, rear seat legroom is limited in keeping in the tradition of 2+2 luxury coupés, though CL has more rear passenger space than its rivals. The CL&#x27;s trunk is as large as that of the Audi A8 flagship saloon.

The C216 makes use of the Distronic Plus cruise control, which debuted on the 2007 S-Class. This system is able to bring the car to a complete stop, and accelerate again to the pre-set speed, to keep a pre-set distance away from the car ahead of it. This Mercedes-Benz CL has also debuted with the new &quot;Active NightVision&quot; program that enables drivers to view the conditions in front of the car despite the dark surroundings.

In 2007, 40 C216 CL 65 AMG units have been sold as 40th Anniversary Edition, to celebrate AMG&#x27;s founding 40 years earlier. Performance wise, the &#x27;40th Anniversary Edition&#x27; was a custom CL 65 AMG. Changes to the car included a &#x27;ONE OUT OF 40&#x27; badge near the COMAND controller, special upholstery and rooflining, and a special &#x27;AMG Alubeam&#x27; paint finish. Apart from the CL 65 AMG 40th Anniversary Edition, only a small selection of showcars got an Alubeam finish, a special paint designed to gleam like liquid metal.

=== 2010 update ===

The facelift version of the Mercedes CL-Class made its world debut in July 2010 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The new CL-Class comes with an improved exterior and interior, but the biggest changes are found under the hood. The exterior gets a new grille, bi-xenon headlights with LED technology, LED fog lamps, revised fenders and hood, and new exhaust pipes. For the interior the biggest change is the addition of a new wood trim. The new CL-Class will also be offered with all the latest technologies including: Active Blind Spot Assist, Attention Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Night View Assist Plus, and Active Body Control.

The model line-up starts with the entry-level CL 500 (550 in the US) powered by the new 4.7 L (4,663cc) V8 direct-injected engine that delivers and of torque, paired to a new seven speed automatic transmission, which accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds. The CL 600 retains the twin-turbo 5.5 L V12 engine and five-speed automatic with a total output of and of torque. It sprints from 0 to 60 mph in 4.0 seconds. Both vehicles are limited to 250 km/h. The CL 63 AMG is powered by a new direct injection, 5.5-litre V8 engine (a larger displacement version of the CL 550&#x27;s) mated to a 7-speed MCT dual-clutch transmission with a total output of and of torque. The CL 65 AMG&#x27;s V12 engine has been tweaked to deliver and of torque, mated to a 5-speed automatic with AMG speedshift.

The last generation of the CL-Class, C216, was available in five models: CL 500 (CL 550 in some markets, with standard 4MATIC in Canada and the USA), CL 600, CL 63 AMG, CL 63 AMG (S) and CL 65 AMG. The CL 65 AMG was the most powerful model of the CL and the most expensive Mercedes-branded vehicle, slightly edging out its S-Class equivalent S 65 AMG and the SLS. CL sales are the third-lowest of Mercedes-Benz in North America with under 1400 units sold in 2006, as only the G-Class four-wheel drive and two-seat SLS AMG sell smaller numbers; annual CL sales equalled Ford truck sales for one day. However, this degree of distinction was considered attractive to CL buyers.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class is a compact executive roadster, produced by Mercedes-Benz. It was released in 1996 and was built at the Mercedes plant in Bremen, Germany, until the end of production in 2020.

The former name &quot;SLK&quot; was derived from &quot;sportlich&quot; (sporty), &quot;leicht&quot; (lightweight), and &quot;kurz&quot; (short). With the release of the facelift R172 in 2016, the SLK-Class was renamed to SLC-Class in accordance with the revised nomenclature adopted by Mercedes. Under this scheme, roadsters use the base name &quot;SL&quot;, followed by the model&#x27;s placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy, the letter &quot;C&quot;, being the roadster equivalent to the C-Class.


== First generation (R170; 1995–2004) ==

The R170 Mercedes SLK was the first generation compact roadster produced by Mercedes-Benz, from 1995 to 2004. It was designed from late 1991 under Bruno Sacco, with a final design being completed in early 1993 and approved by the board, with a German design patent filed on September 30, 1993. The production SLK-Class was introduced at the Turin Motor Show on 22 April 1996, appearing as a modern incarnation of the 1950s Mercedes-Benz 190SL, by returning to four cylinders and with an identical wheelbase. A facelift was introduced to all models in 2000, featuring an updated design and updated engines.

== Second generation (R171; 2004–2010) ==

The R171 SLK was unveiled at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show. It features increased use of high-strength steel, and improvements to the car&#x27;s torsional strength and aerodynamic efficiency. Models feature a more compact, revised roof mechanism that is operated in 22 seconds (previously 25 seconds), resulting in an increase in boot capacity by . The R171 also introduced the Airscarf system that integrates neck-level heating system into the headrests of the car. The front-end design of the car was inspired by the noses found in Formula One cars. It was facelifted in 2008 and featured new engines and minor exterior design changes.

== Third generation (R172; 2011–2020) ==

The R172 SLK was released in 2011. It was available with a range of inline-four, V6, and V8, diesel and petrol engines, and introduced an electronically operated window tint shade for the sunroof, called Magic Sky Control. A facelift was released for vehicles produced from March 2016, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the SLK-Class. The model range was also renamed to SLC-Class to conform to the new Mercedes nomenclature, and introduced new engines and a revised design. In 2020, Mercedes-Benz released a Final Edition to commemorate the end of the car&#x27;s production run.

<text>Augustdorf is a municipality in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It has an area of 42.18 km2 and about 10,100 inhabitants (2020).

==History==
In 1775 Simon August, Count of Lippe-Detmold issued a writ of lease (Meierbrief) for the area of today&#x27;s Augustdorf in favour of August Simon Struß, permitting him to establish a settlement (colony) at Dören hill. In 1779 the actual development plan for the settlement was decided, but the place hardly developed. In 1780 the settlement at Dören consisted of only four tiny thatched huts. In 1789 the settlement was named in honour of Count Simon August.

<doc id="829109" wikidata="Q595857" url="?curid=829109" title="Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class is a former series of mid-size or entry-level luxury coupés and convertibles produced by Mercedes-Benz between 1996 and 2010. Although its design and styling was derived from the E-Class, the mechanical underpinnings were based on the smaller C-Class, and was positioned between the Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class and CL-Class. The name CLK is either derived from the German words &quot;Coupé&quot;, &quot;Luxus&quot; (luxury) and &quot;Kurz&quot; (short) or &quot;Coupé&quot;, &quot;Leicht&quot; (light) and &quot;Kurz&quot; (short), as the clear definition was never published. It primarily competes with the two-door BMW 3 and 6 Series, as well as the Audi A4 Cabriolet and Audi A5 Coupe/Cabriolet, as well as the Maserati Coupe and its convertible variant.

Prior to the CLK-Class, the Mercedes E-Class included a Coupé alongside the saloon/wagon. In 2010, Mercedes changed the CLK-Class nameplate to the E-Class Coupe/Cabriolet; nonetheless this E-Class Coupe/Cabriolet is still based upon the C-Class platform while borrowing the brand and styling/design from the E-Class saloon/wagon. Then for the 2017-2023 model years, the Mercedes E-Class Coupé/Cabriolet shared the platform from the E-Class saloon/wagon. For the 2024 model year, Mercedes is releasing the CLE-Class which like the CLK-Class will share platforms and components with the C-Class and E-Class.

== First generation (C208/A208; 1996–2003) ==

The first-generation C208/A208 CLK was introduced in 1997, and was based on the W202 Mercedes-Benz C-Class launched three years earlier. The C208 coupé was replaced by the C209 CLK-Class in 2002 (for the 2003 model year), although the convertible remained in production until March 2003 when replaced by the A209 CLK. In total 233,367 units of the first generation CLK were manufactured in its coupé form and additional 115,161 cabriolets.

== Second generation (C209/A209; 2001–2009) ==

The Mercedes-Benz C209/A209 is the second generation CLK-Class, and was launched in 2002 with production starting in June. The car was available in both hardtop coupé (C209) and in soft-top convertible form (A209), with a choice of petrol and diesel engines. At introduction, a 2.6-litre V6, a 3.2-litre V6, 5.0-litre V8, 5.4-litre V8 petrol engines, and a 2.1 4 cylinder diesel 2.7L inline-5 diesel and a 3.0 v6 diesel engine with a decent 6.5 sec 0-60 figure where all available. Fuel economy wise between the 2.7 and the 3.0 the v6 was the better option due to a much better performance figure and negligible fuel economy difference. In 2010, the CLK lineup was discontinued and replaced by the C207 E-Class coupé and A207 E-Class convertible.

== Successor (C207/A207; 2008–2017) ==
The C207/A207 E-Class was introduced as part of the new fourth-generation E-Class lineup, and was first shown at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. It is based on the W204 C-Class platform, but shares 60% of its parts with the E-Class sedan and wagon. In 2013, the C207/A207 received a facelift, featuring updated design changes and performance and fuel economy improvements.

<text>Dörentrup is a municipality in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It has an area of 49.79 km2 and c. 8,000 inhabitants (2013).

The name is derived from the Low German word for hill passes, &quot;Dören&quot;.

== Night lighting scheme ==
A remarkable feature in this village is its night lighting scheme. Every night at 11 pm, all street lights turn off. Inhabitants can then request that lights be turned back on as needed by sending a code to a special phone number called Dial4light. Each street has its own code that can be found either online on a specific website or on each light post. 
This is intended to reduce energy use, save money, respect the nocturnal fauna and avoid light pollution.

<doc id="829135" wikidata="Q3147268" url="?curid=829135" title="Ian Goldberg">
<text>Ian Avrum Goldberg (born March 31, 1973) is a cryptographer and cypherpunk. He is best known for breaking Netscape&#x27;s implementation of SSL (with David Wagner), and for his role as chief scientist of Radialpoint (formerly Zero Knowledge Systems), a Canadian software company. Goldberg is currently a professor at the Faculty of Mathematics of the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science within the University of Waterloo, and the Canada Research Chair in Privacy Enhancing Technologies. He was formerly Tor Project board of directors chairman, and is one of the designers of off the record messaging.

==Education==
Goldberg attended high school at the University of Toronto Schools, graduating in 1991. In 1995, he received a B.Math from the University of Waterloo in pure mathematics and computer science. He obtained a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2000. His thesis was entitled &quot;A Pseudonymous Communications Infrastructure for the Internet&quot;. His advisor was Eric Brewer.

==Accomplishments==
As a high school student, Goldberg was a member of Canada&#x27;s team to the International Math Olympiad from 1989 to 1991, where he received a bronze, silver, and gold medal respectively. He was also a member of University of Waterloo team that won the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest in 1994. In 1998, &quot;Wired&quot; Magazine chose him as a member of the &quot;Wired 25&quot;.
In 2011 he won the EFF Pioneer Award. In 2019, he won the USENIX Security Test of Time Award along with his colleagues David Wagner and Randi Thomas and former PhD supervisor Eric Brewer. In 2023, he was named an ACM Fellow.

==Work in cryptography==
In 1995, Goldberg with David Wagner discovered a flaw in the random number generator used for temporary key generation in the SSL implementation of Netscape Navigator.

One of the first cryptanalyses on the WEP wireless encryption protocol was conducted by Goldberg with Nikita Borisov and David Wagner, revealing serious flaws in its design.

Goldberg was a co-author of the Off-the-Record instant messaging encryption protocol. He is also the author of the Perl script included in the novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; by Neal Stephenson.

In 2009 Goldberg was co-author of the Sphinx Mix Format, which is nowadays implemented with the extension of a per-hop payload to increase the privacy of both payer and payee while routing Bitcoin payments through the Lightning Network.

Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, was a research assistant of Goldberg while a student at the University of Waterloo.

Goldberg is a member of the Cryptography, Security and Privacy group as well as the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute (CPI). He has been collaborating with the CPI works on the development of a new interdisciplinary research and education program.

He has voiced many characters in anime and video games, including Yoshikage Kira in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot;, Kengo Akechi in &quot;Kindaichi Case Files&quot;, Sephiroth in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, Dante in &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, Kagaya Ubuyashiki in &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot;, Isshin Kurosaki in &quot;Bleach&quot;, Minato Namikaze in &quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot;, Julius Novachrono in &quot;Black Clover&quot;, Mard Geer Tartaros in &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;, Eizen in &quot;Tales of Berseria&quot;, Boros in &quot;One-Punch Man&quot;, both Eneru, Hatchan and Scopper Gaban in &quot;One Piece&quot;, Tyki Mikk in &quot;D.Gray-man&quot;, Naraku in &quot;Inuyasha&quot;, Griffith in the 1997 series of &quot;Berserk&quot;, Isaburo Sasaki in &quot;Gin Tama&quot; and the main and titular character of &quot;Tekkaman Blade&quot;. He attended Katsuta Voice Actor&#x27;s Academy with Kotono Mitsuishi, Chisa Yokoyama, Wataru Takagi, Sachiko Sugawara, and Michiko Neya.

<doc id="829159" wikidata="Q137728" url="?curid=829159" title="Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line">
<text>The , also known as the Trans-Tokyo Bay Expressway, is an expressway that is mainly made up of a bridge–tunnel combination across Tokyo Bay in Japan. It connects the city of Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture with the city of Kisarazu in Chiba Prefecture, and forms part of National Route 409. With an overall length of 23.7 km, it includes a 4.4 km bridge and 9.6 km tunnel underneath the bay—the fourth-longest underwater tunnel in the world.

== Overview ==
An artificial island, , marks the transition between the bridge and tunnel segments and provides a rest stop with restaurants, shops, and amusement facilities. A distinctive tower standing above the middle of the tunnel, the Kaze no Tō (の, &quot;the tower of wind&quot;), supplies air to the tunnel, its ventilation system powered by the bay&#x27;s almost-constant winds.

The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line shortened the drive between Chiba and Kanagawa, two important industrial areas, from 90 to 15 minutes, and also helped cut travel time from Tokyo and Kanagawa to the seaside leisure spots of the southern Bōsō Peninsula. Before it opened, the trip entailed a 100 km journey along Tokyo Bay and pass through central Tokyo.
An explicit goal of the Aqua-Line was to redirect vehicular flow away from central Tokyo, but the expensive toll has meant only a limited reduction in central-Tokyo traffic.

Many highway bus services now use the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, including lines from Tokyo Station, Yokohama Station, Kawasaki Station, Shinagawa Station, Shibuya Station, Shinjuku Station and Haneda Airport to Kisarazu, Kimitsu, Nagaura station, Ichihara, Mobara, Tōgane, Kamogawa, Katsuura and Tateyama.

==History==
One of the last Japanese megaprojects of the 20th century, the roadway was built at a cost of the ¥1.44 trillion (US$11.2 billion) and opened on December 18, 1997 by then-Crown Prince Naruhito and then-Crown Princess Masako after 23 years of planning and nine years of construction. The roadway was conceived during the bubble economy of the late 1980s.

At opening time, the roadway had the highest toll fee in Japan a one-way trip costs ¥5050 or ¥334 per kilometer. Due to its expensive toll, analysts see lower traffic volume than what Japan Highway Public Corporation, the operator of the roadway, expected at 25,000 cars.

== Tolls ==
The cash toll for a single trip on the Aqua-Line is ¥3,140 for ordinary-size cars (¥2,510 for kei cars); however, using the ETC (electronic toll collection) system, the fare is ¥2320 (¥1860 for kei cars). The ETC toll is reduced to ¥1000 on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. In general, tolls for usage of the Aqua-Line in either direction are collected at the mainline toll plaza on the Kisarazu end.

<doc id="829188" wikidata="Q896988" url="?curid=829188" title="Social parasitism (offense)">
<text>Social parasitism was considered a political crime in the Soviet Union, where individuals accused of living off the efforts of others or society were prosecuted. The Soviet Union, proclaiming itself a workers&#x27; state, mandated that every capable adult engage in work until retirement, theoretically eliminating unemployment.

== Soviet Union ==
In the Soviet Union, which declared itself a workers&#x27; state, every adult able-bodied person was expected to work until official retirement. Thus unemployment was officially and theoretically eliminated. Those who refused to work, study or serve in another way risked being criminally charged with &quot;social parasitism&quot; ( &quot;tuneyadstvo&quot;, [&quot;tuneyadets/tuneyadtsy&quot;&quot;), in accordance with the socialist principle &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution.&quot;

On 4 May 1961 the law &quot;On Intensification of the Struggle against Persons who avoid Socially Useful Work and lead an Anti-social Parasitic Way of Life&quot; which criminalised parasitism entered into force. Those who refused to work were critiqued as &quot;able-bodied citizens who refuse to fulfil their important constitutional duty - to perform honest work to the best of their ability&quot;.

In 1961, 130,000 people were identified as leading the &quot;anti-social, parasitic way of life&quot; in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Charges of parasitism were frequently applied to the homeless, vagrants, beggars, dissidents and refuseniks, many of whom were intellectuals. Since their writings were considered anti-establishment, the state prevented them from obtaining employment. To avoid trials for parasitism, many of them took unskilled (but not especially time-consuming) jobs (street sweepers, boiler room attendants, etc.), which allowed them to continue their other pursuits.

For example, the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky was charged with social parasitism by the Soviet authorities. A 1964 trial found that his series of odd jobs and role as a poet were not a sufficient contribution to society.

A number of Soviet intellectuals and dissidents were accused of the crime of parasitism, including Iosif Begun, Vladimir Voinovich, Lev Kopelev and Andrei Amalrik.

== Belarus ==
On 2 April 2015 President Alexander Lukashenko issued a decree &#x27;On Prevention of Social Dependency&#x27;, which included a tax for those categorised &quot;social parasites&quot;. Lukashenko said the policy was brought in to respond to the half a million citizens who refused to work. The decree said the policy&#x27;s purpose was &quot;to prevent freeloading, encourage employment among able-bodied citizens, and to ensure the compliance with the constitutional obligation of the citizens to participate in the financing of state expenditures&quot;. Individuals exempt from the policy were students, minors, disabled people, retirees, prisoners, and parents with children below the age of seven or those with three or more children who were minors.

Defined as people working under 183 days in a year, and excluding home-makers and subsistence farmers, the deployment of the so-called parasite tax was suspended after protests in several major urban centers.

==Hungary==
Social parasitism (direct translation from Hungarian: Publicly menace work evasion-Közveszélyes munkakerülés, abbreviated: KMK) is a criminal offense prosecuted in the 20th century Hungarian legal system, which was part of the law in force between 1913 and 1989.

In the early 1900s, the need arose to address the situation of the unemployed, unwilling to work, begging, and vagrant masses: the institution of workhouses was considered more effective than the institution of workhouses. Workhouses – where the daily working time was ten hours – were established in a separate part of prisons; for men, the Jászberény Royal District Court Prison was designated, and for women, the Kalocsa Royal Court Prison was designated. According to Article XXI of 1913 on Publicly menace work evasion: &quot;A person of working age who is referred to the court and who shuns work or otherwise engages in a work-avoiding lifestyle shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of eight days to two months for an offence.&quot; The same law criminalized illegal gambling and the plying of prostitutes/sex work as work-avoiding that is dangerous to the public. Foreigners could also be expelled from the country if they were classified as work-avoiding that is menace to the public.
After the Communist took over in Hungary, they re-established this article especially because they had shortage of workers. 
Publicly menace evasion of work was a legally punishable offense or misdemeanor, and its prosecution was an important police task. &quot;Its perpetrators endanger public safety and public order. Those who do not work through no fault of their own usually become criminals, because there is hardly any other way to satisfy their basic life needs (support, profit, inheritance, etc.).&quot;

The Penal Code adopted in 1978(38§) provided for the following regarding evasion: &quot;A person capable of working who engages in a work-avoiding lifestyle, if he has previously been punished for a public-menace work-avoiding offense or violation of the law and two years have not yet passed since the sentence was served or its enforceability ceased, commits a misdemeanor and is punishable by imprisonment for up to one year, corrective labor, or a fine. As an additional punishment, disqualification is also possible.&quot;

Under the Kádár regime(1956-1988), 2–300 people were convicted annually for wook evasion menace to the public, and over 2,000 were sentenced to misdemeanor detention. Legislative Decree 19 of 1984 introduced stricter correctional labor in order to “accustom work” to regular work. Subsequently, the number of so-called work evasion offenders sentenced by court judgment increased to over 2,000.

Work evasion that was dangerous to the public has not been a criminal offense since Act XXIII of 1989 came into force

== Romania ==

Nicolae Ceaușescu, president of the Socialist Republic of Romania, criminalized social parasitism by decree in 1970. The regime viewed young people as potentially destabilizing and targeted those who did not fit into socialist norms. Citizens could be stopped if they were found on the street during hours when they should have been at work or school. Penalties were imprisonment for one to six months, or a fine of 1,000 to 5,000 lei. Indecent or obscene gestures or words carried penalties of 20 days to three months in prison, or a fine of up to 2,000 lei.

A 1976 law broadened the campaign against parasitism. It stated that if someone able to work refused a job, he could be forced by court order to work for one year on construction sites, farms, in forests, or factories. The Miliția was tasked with enforcing the measures, and its actions were often arbitrary.

<text>Tyczyn is a town in southern Poland with a population of 3,353 inhabitants It is located in the Rzeszów County of the Subcarpathian Voivodeship. It is a suburb of the regional capital Rzeszów.

==Geography==
Tyczyn is located in the lower Carpathian foothills, about halfway between the cities of Kraków to the west and Lviv (Lwów) to the east. The center of town is on top of a hill surrounded by numerous farming villages. To the north of town is the Strug River.

== History ==

In 1368, King Casimir III of Poland granted Bartold Tyczner, a merchant from Moravia, a part of the former royal forest to establish a town. Possibly in the late 14th century, it became a private town of the Pilecki family. The Jews migrated into the area during the 15th and 16th centuries.

The town grew and dominated the area until the mid-17th century when it was destroyed first by a Tatar and later by a Cossack invasion. Following the Partitions of Poland, during the years 1792 to 1918 Tyczyn was part of the Austrian Partition of Poland. During those years the area of Tyczyn came under administrative control of Rzeszów, a larger town and a county seat, some north of Tyczyn. Weekly markets and eleven annual fairs were held in Tyczyn in the late 19th century.

Prior to World War II, Tyczyn had a vibrant Jewish shtetl community. During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Tyczyn was captured by the Germans on September 10, 1939. The Jewish residents faced severe restrictions, relocation from their homes to the Rzeszów ghetto, deportations to forced labour and concentration camps, as well as numerous executions. In particular, there is a large mass grave for the Jewish inhabitants who were executed in the forests in the outskirts of the town. George Lucius Salton, a former resident of Tyczyn, estimates that the Nazis reduced Jewish population from approximately 2,000 people to 10 people by end of the war. According to Salton&#x27;s autobiography, most of the ghetto&#x27;s population, promised relocation to a large Ukrainian farm, were taken directly to Belzec where they were gassed in the designated gas chambers. On October 15, 1943, the Gestapo carried out a massacre of five Poles, including one woman, as punishment for aiding Jews. Today, sites within the town serve as memorials and learning centers for the Tyczyn&#x27;s victims of the Holocaust.

<text>The ministry of a deaconess is a usually non-ordained ministry for women in some Protestant, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Orthodox churches to provide pastoral care, especially for other women, and which may carry a limited liturgical role. The word comes from the Greek (), for &quot;deacon&quot;, which means a servant or helper and occurs frequently in the Christian New Testament of the Bible.

Deaconesses trace their roots from the time of Jesus Christ through to the 13th century in the West. They existed from the early through the middle Byzantine periods in Constantinople and Jerusalem; the office may also have existed in Western European churches. There is evidence to support the idea that the diaconate including women in the Byzantine Church of the early and middle Byzantine periods was recognized as one of the major non-ordained orders of clergy.

The English separatists unsuccessfully sought to revive the office of deaconesses in the 1610s in their Amsterdam congregation. Later, a modern resurgence of the office began among Protestants in Germany in the 1840s and spread through Nordic States, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States. Lutherans were especially active and their contributions are seen in numerous hospitals. The modern movement reached a peak about 1910, then slowly declined as secularization undercut religiosity in Europe and the professionalization of nursing and social work offered other career opportunities for young women.

Deaconesses continue to serve in Christian denominations such as Lutheranism and Methodism, among others. In those denominations, before they begin their ministry, they are consecrated as deaconesses.

Non-clerical deaconesses should not be confused with women ordained deacons such as in the Anglican churches, the Methodist churches, and the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, many of which have both ordained deacons and consecrated deaconesses; in Methodism, the male equivalent to female deaconesses are Home Missioners.

==Early Christian period==

The oldest reference to women as deaconesses (or female deacons, there is no distinction of role in Latin or Greek) occurs in Paul&#x27;s letters (). Their ministry is mentioned by early Christian writers such as Clement of Alexandria and Origen. Non-Christian sources from the early 2nd century confirm this. In a letter Pliny the Younger attests to the role of the women deaconesses. Pliny refers to &quot;two maid-servants&quot; as deacons whom he tortures to find out more about the Christians. This establishes the existence of the office of the deaconesses in parts of the eastern Roman Empire from the earliest times. 4th-century Fathers of the Church, such as Epiphanius of Salamis, Basil of Caesarea, John Chrysostom and Gregory of Nyssa accept the ministry of deaconesses as a fact.

The Didascalia of the Apostles is the earliest document that specifically discusses the role of deacons and deaconesses more at length. It originated in Aramaic speaking Syria during the 3rd century, but soon spread in Greek and Latin versions. In it the author urges the bishop: &quot;Appoint a woman for the ministry of women. For there are homes to which you cannot send a deacon to their women, on account of the heathen, but you may send a deaconess ... Also in many other matters the office of a deaconess is required.&quot; The bishop should look on the man who is a deacon as Christ and the woman who is a deaconess as the Holy Spirit, denoting their prominent place in the church hierarchy.

Deaconesses are also mentioned in Canon 19 of Niceae I which states that “since they have no imposition of hands, are to be numbered only among the laity”. The Council of Chalcedon of 451 decreed that women should not be installed as deaconesses until they were 40 years old. The oldest ordination rite for deaconesses is found in the 5th-century Apostolic Constitutions. It describes the laying on of hands on the woman by the bishop with the calling down of the Holy Spirit for the ministry of the diaconate. A full version of the rite, with rubrics and prayers, has been found in the Barberini Codex of 780 AD. This liturgical manual provides an ordination rite for women as deaconesses which is virtually identical to the ordination rite for men as deacons. Other ancient manuscripts confirm the same rite. However some scholars such as Philip Schaff have written that the ceremony performed for ordaining deaconesses was &quot;merely a solemn dedication and blessing.&quot; Still, a careful study of the rite has persuaded most modern scholars that the rite was fully a sacrament in present-day terms.

Olympias, one of the closest friends and supporters of the Archbishop of Constantinople John Chrysostom, was known as a wealthy and influential deaconess during the 5th century. Justinian&#x27;s legislation in the mid-6th century regarding clergy throughout his territories in the East and the West mentioned men and women as deacons in parallel. He also included women as deacons among those he regulated for service at the Great Church of Hagia Sophia, listing men and women as deacons together, and later specifying one hundred deacons who were men and forty who were women. Evidence of continuing liturgical and pastoral roles is provided by Constantine Porphyrogenitus&#x27; 10th-century manual of ceremonies (), which refers to a special area for deaconesses in Hagia Sophia.

===Pauline text===
Paul&#x27;s earliest mention of a woman as deacon is in his Letter to the Romans 16:1 (AD 58) where he says: &quot;I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is the servant of the church at Cenchreae&quot;. The original Greek says: , , being [the] [female] servant of the church at Cenchreae. The word means servant in nearly all of its 30 uses in the New Testament, but may also be used to refer to the church office of deacon. There is no scholarly consensus regarding whether the phrase here denotes &quot;an official title of a permanent ministry.&quot; The term may refer to her serving in a more generic sense, without holding a church office.

A reference to the qualifications required of deacons appears in Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to Timothy 3:8–13 (NRSV translation):

This verse about &quot;the women&quot; appears in the middle of a section that also addresses the men. However, the words regarding &quot;the women&quot; may refer to the wives of male deacons, or to deacons who are women. The transition from deacons generally to female deacons in particular may make sense linguistically, because the same word covers both men and women. To indicate the women, the Greeks would sometimes say (&quot;deacon women&quot;). This expression appears in the church legislation of Justinian. This interpretation is followed by some early Greek Fathers such as John Chrysostom and Theodore of Mopsuestia. However, this is not the phrase used here, where Paul refers simply to (women).

Commentary on 1 Corinthians 9:5 &quot;Have we not the right to take a woman around with us as a sister, like all the other apostles?&quot; by Clement of Alexandria (150 AD to 215 AD):

As Clement of Alexandria made mention of Paul&#x27;s reference to deaconesses in 1 Timothy 3:11, so Origen of Alexandria (184 AD to 254 AD) commented on Phoebe, the deacon that Paul mentions in Romans 16:1–2:

The Apostolic Constitutions say:

===Women as deacons===
Two types of monastic women were typically ordained to the diaconate in the early and middle Byzantine period: abbesses and nuns with liturgical functions, as well as the wives of men who were being raised to the episcopacy. There was a strong association of deacons who were women with abbesses starting in the late fourth century or early fifth century in the East, and it occurred in the medieval period in the Latin as well as the Byzantine Church. Principally, these women lived in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, where the office of deaconess was most often found. There is literary evidence of a diaconate including women, particularly in Constantinople, and archaeological evidence of deaconesses in a number of other areas in the Empire, particularly Asia Minor. One example of a woman from Constantinople being a deacon during the post-Constantine period was Olympias, a well-educated woman, who after being widowed devoted her life to the church and was ordained a deacon. She supported the church with gifts of land and her wealth which was typical during this period. Women who are deacons are often mistaken as being only widows or wives of deacons; and it is sometimes described that they came out of an order of widows. Minor church offices developed about the same time as the diaconate in response to the needs of growing churches. Widows, however, were elderly women of the congregation in need of economic help and social support due to their situation. This concept is mentioned in the first Acts 6:1 and 9:39–41 and 1 Timothy 5. These widows had no specific duties compared to that of the deacons. In the Apostolic Constitutions women who were deacons were recognized as having power over the widows in the church. The widows were cautioned to obey &quot;women deacons with piety, reverence and fear&quot;. In the first four centuries of the church, widows were recognized members of the church who shared some similar functions of a deaconess; yet did not share the same responsibilities or importance.

===Roles===
In the Byzantine church women who were deacons had both liturgical and pastoral functions within the church. These women also ministered to other women in a variety of ways, including instructing catechumens, assisting with women&#x27;s baptisms and welcoming women into the church services. They also mediated between members of the church, and they cared for the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of the imprisoned and the persecuted. They were sent to women who were housebound due to illness or childbirth. They performed the important sacramental duty of conducting the physical anointing and baptism of women. Ordination to the diaconate was also appropriate for those responsible for the women&#x27;s choir, a liturgical duty. Evidence in the (or &quot;Life of St. Macrina&quot;) shows that Lampadia was responsible for the women&#x27;s choir. Some believe that they were also officiant of the Eucharist, but this practice was seen as invalid.

===Art===
It has been argued that some examples of Christian art reflect the leadership roles of women as deacons including administration of the host, teaching, baptizing, caring for the physical needs of the congregation and leading the congregation in prayers. Some depictions of women in early Christian art in various ministerial roles were, arguably, later covered up to depict men. The fresco in the Catacombs of Priscilla has been claimed as one example of a conspiracy to deny women&#x27;s involvement in the Eucharist. Another example involves the chapel of St. Zeno in the Church of St. Praxida in Rome. An inscription denoting a woman in the mosaic as, &quot;Episcopa Theodora&quot; was altered by dropping the feminine –ra ending, thereby transforming into a masculine name. Because is the feminine form of the Greek word for bishop or overseer, the inscription suggests that Theodora was a woman who became a bishop; however, this appellation was also originally used to honour the mother or wife of a bishop.

===Decline of the diaconate including women===
After the 4th century the role of women as deacons changed somewhat in the West. It appeared that the amount of involvement with the community and the focus on individual spirituality did not allow any deacon who was a woman to define her own office. During the rule of Constantine, as Christianity became more institutionalized, leadership roles for women decreased. It was during the fifth and sixth centuries in the western part of the Roman Empire that the role of deaconesses became less favorable. The councils of Orange in 441 and Orléans in 533 directly targeted the role of the deaconesses, forbidding their ordination. By at least the 9th or 10th century, nuns were the only women ordained as deacons. Evidence of diaconal ordination of women in the West is less conclusive from the 9th to the early 12th centuries than for previous eras, although it does exist and certain ceremonials were retained in liturgy books to modern times.

In Constantinople and Jerusalem, there is enough of a historical record to indicate that the diaconate including women continued to exist as an ordained order for most if not all of this period. In the Byzantine Church, the decline of the diaconate which included women began sometime during the iconoclastic period with the vanishing of the ordained order for women in the twelfth century. It is probable the decline started in the late seventh century with the introduction into the Byzantine Church of severe liturgical restrictions on menstruating women. By the eleventh century, the Byzantine Church had developed a theology of ritual impurity associated with menstruation and childbirth. Dionysius of Alexandria and his later successor, Timothy, had similar restriction on women receiving the Eucharist or entering the church during menses. Thus, &quot;the impurity of their menstrual periods dictated their separation from the divine and holy sanctuary.&quot; By the end of the medieval period the role of the deacons decreased into mere preparation for priesthood, with only liturgical roles. In the 12th and 13th century, deaconesses had mainly disappeared in the European Christian church and, by the 11th century, were diminishing in the Eastern Mediterranean Christian churches. Even so, there is substantial evidence of their existence throughout the history of Eastern Churches.

=== Restoration of the female diaconate ===
In August 2016, the Catholic Church established a Study Commission on the Women&#x27;s Diaconate to study the history of female deacons and to study the possibility of ordaining women as deacons. Until today, the Armenian Apostolic Church is still ordaining religious Sisters as deaconesses, the last Monastic deaconess was Sister Hripsime Sasounian (died in 2007) and on 25 September 2017, Ani-Kristi Manvelian a twenty-four-year-old woman was ordained in Tehran&#x27;s St. Sarkis Mother Church as the first lay deaconess after many centuries. The Russian Orthodox Church had a female monastic subdiaconate into the 20th century. The Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Greece restored the female monastic order of &quot;deaconess&quot; in 2004. And on 16 November 2016, the Holy Synod of Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria also restored the female diaconate, actually for subdeaconesses. On 3 May 2024, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all of Africa ordained in Zimbabwe the first deaconess of any patriarchate in the global Eastern Orthodox Church.

== Reformation era ==
The Damsels of Charity, founded in 1559 by Prince Henri Robert de la Marck of Sedan, have sometimes been regarded as the first Protestant association of deaconesses, although they were not called by that name.

Mennonites had a practice of consecrating deaconesses. Count Zinzendorf of the Moravian Church began consecrating deaconesses in 1745.

== Late modern period ==
The deaconess movement was revived in the mid 19th century, starting in Germany and spread to some other areas, especially among Lutherans, Anglicans and Methodists. The professionalization of roles such as nursing and social work in the early 20th century undercut its mission of using lightly trained amateurs. By the late 20th century secularization in Europe had weakened all church-affiliated women&#x27;s groups, though deaconesses continue to play an important role in many Christian denominations today.

===Europe===
The spiritual revival in the Americas and Europe of the 19th century allowed middle-class women to seek new roles for themselves; they now could turn to deaconess service. In Victorian England, and northern Europe, the role of deaconess was socially acceptable. A point of internal controversy was whether that the lifelong vow prevented the deaconesses from marrying. While deacons are ordained, deaconesses are not.

The modern movement began in Germany in 1836 when Theodor Fliedner and his wife Friederike Münster opened the first deaconess motherhouse in Kaiserswerth on the Rhine, inspired by the existing deaconesses among the Mennonites. The diaconate was soon brought to England and Scandinavia, Kaiserswerth model. The women obligated themselves for five years of service, receiving room, board, uniforms, pocket money, and lifelong care. The uniform was the usual dress of the married woman. There were variations, such as an emphasis on preparing women for marriage through training in nursing, child care, social work and housework. In the Anglican churches, the diaconate was an auxiliary to the ordained ministry. By 1890 there were over 5,000 deaconesses in Europe, chiefly in Germany, Scandinavia and England.
In Switzerland, the &quot;Institution des diaconesses&quot; was founded in 1842 in Échallens by the Reformed pastor Louis Germond. In France an order of Protestant deaconesses named &quot;Diaconesses de Reuilly&quot; were founded in 1841 in Paris by Reformed pastor and by a parishioner named Caroline Malvesin. In Strasbourg another order was founded in 1842 by Lutheran minister François-Henri Haerter (a.k.a. Franz Heinrich Härter in German). All three deaconesses orders are still active today, especially in hospitals, old age care and spiritual activities (retreats, teaching and preaching).

In World War II, diaconates in war zones sustained heavy damage. As eastern Europe fell to communism, most diaconates were shut down and 7000 deaconesses became refugees in West Germany.

The DIAKONIA World Federation was established in 1947 with motherhouses from Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland signed the constitution. By 1957, in Germany there were 46,000 deaconesses and 10,000 associates. Other countries reported a total of 14,000 deaconesses, most of them Lutherans. In the United States and Canada, 1,550 women were counted, half of them in the Methodist churches.

====Denmark====
Charged by Princess Louise to investigate the Deaconess Institutes in Germany, Sweden and France with a view to creating one in Denmark, Louise Conring was the first Danish woman to be trained in nursing, ultimately heading the Deaconess Institute in Copenhagen from its inauguration in 1863.

====England and the British Empire====
In 1862, Elizabeth Catherine Ferard received Deaconess Licence No. 1 from the Bishop of London, making her the first deaconess of the Church of England. On 30 November 1861 she had founded the North London Deaconess Institution and the community which would become the (deaconess) Community of St. Andrew. The London Diocesan Deaconess Institution also trained deaconesses for other dioceses and some served overseas and began deaconess work in Melbourne, Lahore, Grahamstown, South Africa and New Zealand. In 1887, Isabella Gilmore oversaw the revival of deaconesses not living in a community.

Lady Grisell Baillie (1822–1891) became the first deaconess in the Church of Scotland in 1888. She was commemorated in 1894 by the opening of the Lady Grisell Baillie Memorial Hospital in Edinburgh which was later renamed the Deaconess Hospital.

====Finland====
In the 1850s, Amanda Cajander trained as a deaconess at the Evangelical Deaconess Institute in Saint Petersburg. The wealthy Finnish philanthropist Aurora Karamsin was familiar with the Russian institute, and when she decided to open a deaconess institution in Finland in Helsinki, she invited Cajander to be its first principal. The institute opened in December 1867, during the great Famine of 1866–68. The first deaconess to have been trained in Finland was Cecilia Blomqvist.

====Norway====

In 1866 Cathinka Guldberg went to Kaiserswerth, (Germany) to educate herself as a nurse and deaconess. She visited the Lutheran religious community at Kaiserswerth-am-Rhein, where she observed Pastor Theodor Fliedner and the deaconesses working with the sick and the deprived. In 1869 she returned to Norway and established the first deaconess instuition in Norway, the Christiania Deaconess House (&quot;Diakonissehuset Christiania&quot;) and started Norway&#x27;s first professional nursing program.

====Sweden====

The first Deaconess institution in Sweden, Ersta diakoni, was founded in the capital of Stockholm in 1851. The office of head of the institution was offered to Maria Cederschiöld before it was founded, and Cederschiöld studied the deaconess institution Kaiserswerth in Germany under Theodor Fliedner in 1850-1851 before participating in the foundation of the institution in Sweden upon her return, herself becoming the first Swedish deaconess. Maria Cederschiöld of the Ersta diakoni also participated in the foundation of the first deaconess institution in Norway in Oslo.

===North America===
Lutheran pastor William Passavant was involved in many innovative programs; he brought the first four deaconesses to the United States after a visit to Fliedner in Kaiserswerth. They worked in the Pittsburgh Infirmary (now Passavant Hospital). Another more indirect product of Kaiserswerth was Elizabeth Fedde, who trained in Norway under a Kaiserswerth alumna, then established hospitals in Brooklyn, New York and Minneapolis, Minnesota (as well as provided the impetus for other hospitals in Chicago, Illinois and Grand Forks, North Dakota), although she turned down Passavant&#x27;s invitation to administer his hospital.

In 1884, Germans in Philadelphia brought seven sisters from Germany to run their hospital. Other deaconesses soon followed and began ministries in several United States cities with large Lutheran populations. In 1895, the Lutheran General Synod approved an order of deaconesses, defining a deaconess as an &quot;unmarried woman&quot; of &quot;approved fitness&quot; serving &quot;Christ and the Church&quot;. It set up its deaconess training program in Baltimore. By the 1963 formation of the Lutheran Church in America, there were three main centers for deaconess work: Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Omaha. These three sisterhoods combined and form what became the Deaconess Community of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Since 2019, the ELCA has permitted deaconesses (and deacons) to be ordained into its Word and Service roster. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) has also promoted the role of deaconess.

The imperatives of the Social Gospel movement (1880s–1920s) led deaconesses to improve life for the new immigrants in large cities. In accord with the reform impulses of the Progressive Era, many agitated for laws protecting women workers, the establishment of public health and sanitation services, and improvement of social and state support for poor mothers and their children. Beginning in 1889, Emily Malbone Morgan used the proceeds of her published writings to establish facilities where working woman and their children of all faiths could vacation and renew their spirits.

In 1888, Cincinnati&#x27;s German Protestants opened a hospital (&quot;Krankenhaus&quot;) staffed by deaconesses. It evolved into the city&#x27;s first general hospital, and included a nurses&#x27; training school. It was renamed Deaconess Hospital in 1917. Many other cities developed a deaconess hospital in similar fashion.

In Chicago, physician and educator Lucy Rider Meyer initiated deaconess training at her Chicago Training School for Home and Foreign Missions as well as editing a periodical, &quot;The Deaconess Advocate&quot;, and writing a history of deaconesses, &quot;Deaconesses: Biblical, Early Church, European, American&quot; (1889). She is credited with reviving the office of deaconess in the Methodist Episcopal Church.

In 1896 Methodist deaconesses founded the New England Deaconess Hospital to care for Bostonians, and the hospital added a staff of medical professionals in 1922. In 1996, the hospital merged with Beth Israel Hospital, which had opened in 1916 to serve Jewish immigrants, and thus formed the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

In 1907 Anna Alexander became the first (and only, due to the later suspension of deaconess as an office distinct from deacon) African-American deaconess in the Episcopal Church and she served in the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia during her entire career.

Mennonites founded the Bethel Deaconess Home and Hospital Society for nursing education and service in Newton, Kansas, in 1908. Over the next half century, 66 Mennonite women served there. They were unmarried but did not take explicit vows of chastity and poverty. They worked and prayed under the close supervision of founder and head sister, Frieda Kaufman (1883–1944). With the growing professionalization of graduate nursing, few women joined after 1930.

Canadian Methodists considered establishing a deaconess order at the general conference of 1890. They voted to allow the regional conferences to begin deaconess work, and by the next national conference in 1894, the order became national. The Methodist National Training School and Presbyterian Deaconess and Missionary Training Home joined to become the United Church Training School in 1926, later joining with the Anglican Women Training College to become the Centre for Christian Studies, currently in Winnipeg. This school continues to educate men and women for diaconal ministry in the United and Anglican churches.

Between 1880 and 1915, 62 training schools were opened in the United States. The lack of training had weakened Passavant&#x27;s programs. However recruiting became increasingly difficult after 1910 as young women preferred graduate nursing schools or the social work curriculum offered by state universities.

=== Federated States of Micronesia ===
In 1982, Adelyn Noda became the youngest woman in Kosrae, the Federated States of Micronesia, to be ordained as a deaconess. She went on to become a teacher.

=== Australia ===
The Presbyterian and Methodist Churches both had deaconesses prior to church union that formed the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977. In 1991, the National Assembly agreed to ordain deacons — men and women. The first person to be ordained as a deacon was Betty Matthews in Perth, Western Australia, in 1992. The member association is Diakonia of the Uniting Church in Australia (DUCA).

The Anglican Church in Australia ordains transitional deacons and permanent deacons. The professional organisation for permanent deacons is the Australian Anglican Diaconal Association.

===New Zealand===
The Presbyterian Church of New Zealand (now the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand) started a Deaconess order in 1903 with the establishment of the Deaconess Training House in Dunedin. The work of deaconesses in New Zealand had been begun by Sister Christabel Duncan who arrived from Australia to begin work in Dunedin in 1901. By 1947 Deaconesses could choose from two three-year courses – the General Course or the Advanced Course. Women undertaking the Advanced Course could gain a Bachelor of Divinity Degree with the same theological training as Ministers through the Theological Hall at Knox College in Dunedin, as well as training in social services, teaching, nursing and missionary service. In 1965 the Church allowed women to be ordained as ministers leading to a decline in women seeking deaconess training and the Deaconess Order was wound up in 1975. Deaconesses could either become ordained as Ministers or become lay members of the Church, while still remaining employed.

The Presbyterian Research Centre, Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand in Dunedin, New Zealand, holds a collection of papers and other memorabilia relating to Presbyterian Deaconesses. The PCANZ Deaconess Collection was added to the UNESCO Memory of the World New Zealand Register in 2018.

===Philippines===
There are four member associations of the DIAKONIA World Federation in the Philippines: Commission on Deaconess Service of the United Methodist Church; Deaconess Association of Iglesia Evangelica En Las Islas Filipinas; Deaconess Association of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines; and Ang Iglesia Metodista sa Pilipinas.

The Iglesia ni Cristo&#x27;s deaconesses are married women.

<text>Leopoldshöhe is a municipality in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, with ca. 16,000 inhabitants (2015).

Located in the rolling plains north of the Teutoburger Wald range, Leopoldshöhe consists of eight formerly independent municipalities: Asemissen, Bechterdissen and Greste to the south, Leopoldshöhe proper, Krentrup and Schuckenbaum at the center, and Nienhagen and Bexterhagen to the north. Both Asemissen and Leopoldshöhe proper have a pronounced infrastructure (supermarkets, gas stations, specialized shops, etc.).

Located only 10 km from the city of Bielefeld, the southern and central parts of the municipality today have a mostly suburban feel to them, but also contain several industrial zones, whereas the north is still mainly rural.

Asemissen is only a few hundred meters away from the A2 autobahn motorway, and (with the Oerlinghausen railway station) is on the railway line from Bielefeld to Detmold and Lemgo. A bus service connects almost all villages to the railway station.

== History ==
Local proper names still existing today - particularly of the village of &quot;Krentrup&quot; - indicate settlements in the area well before 800 AD. The estate of Niederbarkhausen, at the border between Asemissen and Oerlinghausen, is mentioned in the oldest surviving document about the area, which dates from 1036 AD. In 1616, a total of 55 farms and estates is counted in the area of today&#x27;s municipality.

Since this large rural area was rather sparsely populated, there was no church and people had to walk to other communities to attend service, until, in 1850, a church was built exactly in the middle between the neighboring churches of Oerlinghausen and Schötmar. Leopold II, Prince of Lippe, attended the consecration and named the budding village around the church after himself. Today, Leopoldshöhe proper is the only one of the eight constituent villages to have a centralized structure with church, market square, etc.

<text>Warcino () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Kępice, within Słupsk County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

==Geography==
The settlement lies in Farther Pomerania on the left bank of the Wieprza river, approximately southwest of Kępice, southwest of Słupsk, and west of the regional capital Gdańsk.

==History==

The settlement, first mentioned in a 1485 deed, when it was part of the Duchy of Pomerania ruled by the Griffin duke Bogislaw X (1454-1523). The estates were held by nobles from nearby Zitzewitz (now Sycewice, Poland). Devastated in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the region was incorporated into the Brandenburg-Prussian province of Pomerania in 1653. The Varzin branch of the Zitzewitz noble family became extinct in 1781, whereafter the estates changed hands several times.

In 1867 it was bought from the Blumenthal family for Otto von Bismarck by the grateful Prussian state for his services as Minister President during the Austro-Prussian War. Bismarck, though born in the Altmark region of central Germany, had ties to eastern Pomerania as he had spent several years of his childhood at his family&#x27;s estates in Kniephof (now Konarzewo) near Naugard, and married Johanna von Puttkamer (of the Pomeranian Puttkamer noble family) at nearby Kolziglow in 1847. Bismarck evidently enjoyed the lifestyle of a Prussian Junker and the manor with its extended park and forests became one of the couple&#x27;s favoured residences. Johanna died staying at Varzin in 1894, preceding her husband by four years. Otto von Bismarck then retired to his Friedrichsruh manor in Lauenburg.

Varzin manor remained in the possession of the Bismarck family until the end of World War II. The last family resident, Countess Sybille von Bismarck (née von Arnim), widow of Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s son Wilhelm, declined to flee and, at age 81, committed suicide when Red Army forces were approaching in March 1945. She was buried in a family mausoleum on the grounds, which however was destroyed in 1957. After the war, the remaining German residents of the area were forcibly expelled and the locale became the Polish Warcino. The manor house, converted into a forestry college, retained a huge depiction of Bismarck&#x27;s horse, Schmetterling, on its walls.

In 2011–2012, the remains of the ruinous Protestant half-timbered church in nearby Ciecholub were saved and relocated to the Warcino park. The rebuilt church was consecrated by the Evangelical bishop Marcin Hintz on 17 August 2012.

==Notable people==
*Theodor Fontane visited Varzin, which is mentioned in his novel &quot;Effi Briest&quot;
*Count Gustav Kálnoky, Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary, arrived in Varzin in 1884 for conversations on Triple Alliance matters with Chancellor Bismarck
*Walter Flex, author of the &quot;Wild Geese&quot; poem, stayed at Varzin as a tutor of the Bismarck family in 1910-11
*Marion Dönhoff rested at Varzin during her equestrian flight from East Prussia in 1945 and spent several days there with Sybille von Bismarck.
*Johanna von Puttkamer

<doc id="829291" wikidata="Q1196460" url="?curid=829291" title="Kintai Bridge">
<text>The is a historical wooden arch bridge in the city of Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan.

The pedestrian bridge was built in 1673, spanning the Nishiki River in a series of five wooden arches. The bridge is located on the foot of Mt. Yokoyama, at the top of which lies Iwakuni Castle.

Kikkou Park, which includes the bridge and castle, is a popular tourist destination in Japan, particularly during the Cherry blossom festival in the spring and the autumn color change of the Japanese maples. It was declared a National Treasure in 1922.

==History==
After Iwakuni Castle was completed in 1608 by Kikkawa Hiroie, the first lord of Iwakuni Domain, a series of wooden bridges was built. However, most of them were destroyed by floods several times before the construction of Kintai Bridge. Afterwards, Kintai Bridge was built by the third lord, Kikkawa Hiroyoshi, in 1673. The new stone piers replaced the old wooden ones. Though thought to be flood-proof, the bridge was destroyed by a flood the next year. As a result, the stone piers were redesigned for greater strength, and a special tax was created to maintain the bridge. This maintenance involved periodically rebuilding the bridge: every 20 years for three spans in the middle, every 40 years for two spans that connect to the banks.

Consequently, the footbridge remained intact for 276 years, until washed away again in a flood from typhoon Kijia in 1950. It was in a weakened state at the time, as the Japanese had stopped maintaining the bridge during World War II. In 1953, the bridge was reconstructed similar to the original.

In 1922, the bridge was declared a national treasure. Between 2001 and 2004, all five bridge girders were restored for the first time in 50 years.

==Architecture==
The bridge is composed of five sequential wooden arch bridges on four stone piers as well as two wooden piers on the dry riverbed where the bridge begins and ends. Each of the three middle spans is 35.1 meters long, while the two end spans are 34.8 meters, for a total length of about 175 meters with a width of 5 meters.

===Original construction===
For nearly three hundred years, the many versions of the bridge stood without the use of metal nails. This was achieved by the careful fitting of the wooden parts and by the construction of the thick girders by clamping and binding them together with metal belts. The main wooden parts of the bridge were covered by sheets of copper for additional durability.

===Flood protection===
The shape and weight of the bridge made it extremely strong at the top, but incredibly weak from underneath. To address concern that flood waters rushing along the river would destroy the bridge in its entirety, the bridge was designed so that the wooden pathway merely &quot;floats&quot; on top of its frame using mortise and tenon joints. This allowed rising flood waters to lift out the wooden pathway and carry it off down stream while sparing the main structure.

<doc id="829297" wikidata="Q5153725" url="?curid=829297" title="Virginia–Virginia Tech football rivalry">
<text>The Virginia–Virginia Tech football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Virginia Cavaliers football team of the University of Virginia (called Virginia in sports media and abbreviated &quot;UVA&quot;) and Virginia Tech Hokies football team of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (called Virginia Tech and abbreviated &quot;VT&quot;). The two schools first met in 1895 and have played annually since 1970. The game counts for 1 point in the &quot;Commonwealth Clash&quot; each year, and is part of the greater Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry.

Since 1990, the game has nearly always been held in late November, often on Thanksgiving weekend. The scheduling of this rivalry has taken the place of Virginia&#x27;s South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry game versus North Carolina, which was played on Thanksgiving Day every year between 1910 and 1950 (save for when the programs disbanded during World War I). It has also taken the place of the VMI–Virginia Tech football rivalry which was held on Thanksgiving Day up through 1971. In 1964, the UVA–VPI game began alternating between Lane Stadium and Scott Stadium on the campuses of the two universities. Previously, the series was sometimes played in Richmond, Norfolk, and at Victory Stadium in Roanoke.

The rivalry has seen many streaks. Virginia started 8–0 in the series, outscoring VPI 175–5. The Cavaliers again went unbeaten (7–0–1) from 1945 to 1952, outscoring the Gobblers 267–47, with four shutouts. VPI then went 12–2 in games from 1953 to 1966. More recently, Virginia Tech won a series record 15 straight games in the rivalry from 2004–2018 before the Cavaliers defeated the Hokies in 2019. Currently, the Hokies have won 4 straight in the series since 2020 (2022 being cancelled).

Virginia and Virginia Tech were both led by College Football Hall of Fame coaches in the 1980s and 1990s. George Welsh led UVA to a three-week run as the nation&#x27;s AP No. 1 ranked team in 1990; shared ACC championships in 1989 and 1995; 85 ACC wins, second-most all-time (behind only Bobby Bowden); and an 8–6 record against Frank Beamer, a fellow Hall of Famer who led Virginia Tech to an appearance in a BCS National Championship Game; sole ACC championships in 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2010; four previous Big East Championships; and a dominant 14–1 record against Welsh&#x27;s successors (Al Groh and Mike London). This rivalry game has three times served as a &quot;de facto&quot; Coastal Championship Game: in 2007 and 2011, won by Beamer&#x27;s Hokies; and in 2019, won by Bronco Mendenhall&#x27;s Cavaliers.

== Commonwealth Cup Trophy ==
In 1996, a trophy was created for the rivalry, known as the Commonwealth Cup. The winning team holds the trophy until the next game, which has been held annually since 1970. Currently, the Virginia Tech Hokies football team holds the cup, having won the 2024 edition of the contest. 

The trophy is constructed of marble and cherry wood, and is four feet high. It also contains the scores of all of the games in the series. The cup is engraved with the names of the two schools and is mounted atop a trapezoidal base that makes up most of the trophy&#x27;s length. The front of the base features a stylized map of Virginia with Blacksburg and Charlottesville represented by stars on the map.&#x27;

==History==
The Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry has existed since the 1890s, but did not reach pre-eminence until the 1980s. Traditionally, Virginia&#x27;s primary rival had been the Tar Heels of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in a game which became known as the South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry. UVA and UNC had the most successful football programs of early Southern college football, as the name indicates: between 1889 and 1902, either Virginia or North Carolina claimed a southern championship in twelve out of fourteen years. VPI&#x27;s rival was the Virginia Military Institute, with whom they shared a military tradition, geographic proximity, and similar acronyms (VMI and VPI).

The Virginia–VPI rivalry did have its heated moments, even early on. Hokie Hunter Carpenter, played nearly two full modern college football careers with Virginia Tech and the University of North Carolina. &quot; &quot;The Cavalier Daily&quot; accused Carpenter of being paid, as he had played college football already for nearly a decade. Carpenter signed an affidavit that he had not received payment to play against UVA in any of the eight years (two of which he actually played for UNC in the South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry). After the VPI victory, Carpenter threatened to sue the UVA student paper for libel and UVA refused to play VPI again for eighteen years after, until 1923. Carpenter moved to Middletown, New York and never returned to the Commonwealth.

This rivalry game has been played in late November, often on Thanksgiving weekend, each year since 2000 and in every year but two (1999, when the game was played early in the season, and 2020, when the game was postponed two weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic) since 1990. This was not always the case, as the aforementioned Virginia–Carolina and VPI–VMI rivalry games were played on Thanksgiving Day for much of the 20th century. In the wake of the 2022 University of Virginia shooting, resulting in the death of 3 Virginia players, the 2022 edition was cancelled.

== Memorable games ==

===1995: Tech Comeback=== 
The Virginia Cavaliers came into the &#x27;95 contest looking for their ninth regular season win. Virginia led 29–14 going into the fourth quarter, however Virginia Tech then stormed back and a Jim Druckenmiller touchdown pass to Jermaine Holmes gave the Hokies the lead with forty seven seconds left. The Cavaliers&#x27; last attempt to win the game was then snuffed out when a Mike Groh pass was intercepted and taken to the endzone by Antonio Banks, who avoided a sideline trip by a UVA athletic trainer, Joe Gieck. The Hokies went on to the 1995 Sugar Bowl to defeat Texas, whereas Virginia went on to the 1995 Peach Bowl to defeat Georgia.

===1998: Cavalier Revenge===
Both teams entered the &#x27;98 matchup in ranked in the Top 25 and looking for their ninth win. Virginia Tech took no time jumping out in front. The Hokies took a 17–0 lead early and led at halftime 29–7. The Hoos then came out on fire and outscored the Hokies 29–3 in the second half. A now legendary touchdown pass from quarterback Aaron Brooks to Ahmad Hawkins put Virginia up by four, and a Wali Rainer interception preserved a Virginia comeback victory, arguably their most impressive win in Blacksburg. By erasing a 22-point deficit in the second half, the Cavalier victory made for the greatest comeback win of the long series by either program. As in 1995, Virginia again faced Georgia, and again in the Peach Bowl, but this time narrowly losing. Virginia Tech avenged their rivalry loss by easily defeating Alabama in the 1998 Music City Bowl.

===2003: Wali&#x27;s World===
The Virginia Cavaliers entered the &#x27;03 Commonwealth Cup looking to snap a four game losing streak against the Hokies. Virginia Tech led 14–7 at the half, but Virginia came out in the second half firing on all cylinders, and outscored Tech 21–0 by the 14 minute mark in the fourth quarter. Up by seven with only a few minutes left, Virginia pulled off a fake field goal on fourth down to keep possession away from the Hokies. Wali Lundy ran in it for the score on the next play, capping a dominant performance of three rushing touchdowns and a receiving touchdown. Virginia held on to the win 35–21. This game also saw Matt Schaub tie Shawn Moore for all time passing touchdowns at Virginia. The Cavaliers went on to defeat Pittsburgh in the 2003 Continental Tire Bowl, while the Hokies went on to lose to California in the 2003 Insight Bowl. 

===2018: The Fumble Touchdown===
The &#x27;18 rivalry game saw the first overtime game, and perhaps the most dramatic fourth quarter, thus far in the long series. Virginia had high hopes of ending the 14-game losing streak against a Tech team that had mostly limped through the season. But Virginia Tech led 14–0 at halftime, only to fall behind by a touchdown with only two minutes remaining. On the ensuing Tech drive, the Hokies drove to the redzone. Hokie running back Steven Peoples fumbled the ball inside the five-yard line but it was recovered by wide receiver Hezekiah Grimsley in the endzone for a touchdown. The game then went into overtime and the Hokies managed only a field goal. Virginia completed a pass to the Hokie 14 on their first play, but quarterback Bryce Perkins fumbled on the next, and it was recovered by the defense to end the game, with a most unlikely Virginia Tech victory that extended their winning streak to 15 and bowl streak to 26. Despite the rivalry loss, Virginia went on to defeat South Carolina in the 2018 Belk Bowl, while Virginia Tech lost to Cincinnati in the 2018 Military Bowl.

===2019: Virginia ends the streak===
No. 24 Virginia Tech (8–3) and unranked Virginia (8–3) were tied for first place in the Coastal Division with identical 5–2 ACC records coming into the game, making the traditional Thanksgiving weekend matchup a &quot;de facto&quot; Coastal Championship Game with the winner advancing to the 2019 ACC Championship Game against Clemson. The Hokies rolled into Charlottesville with a full head of steam, as quarterback Hendon Hooker was 6–0 as a starter and the Virginia Tech defense had just shut down Georgia Tech and Pittsburgh by the combined score of 73–0 in Bud Foster&#x27;s final season. The Hokies had also won 15 consecutive games in the rivalry (including two previous division championship games in 2007 and 2011, by scores of 33-21 and 38-0 respectively) and were slight favorites to win again. Perkins completed 20-of-33 passes for 311 yards and rushed for another 164, totaling 475 combined yards. Perkins set the tone early with a pair of long first-quarter touchdown runs. In the fourth quarter, Cavalier kicker Brian Delaney made a 48-yard field goal with 1:23 left in the game to give UVA a 33–30 lead. On the next drive, Virginia Tech fumbled in its own end zone which was recovered by Virginia with 1:01 left, effectively ending the game. Virginia fans rushed the field as the Cavaliers ended their losing streak against the Hokies. Virginia went on to lose to Florida in the 2019 Orange Bowl, while Virginia Tech lost to Kentucky in the 2019 Belk Bowl.

<doc id="829315" wikidata="Q68719" url="?curid=829315" title="Alex Wright">
<text>Alexander Wright (born May 17, 1975) is a German former professional wrestler and professional wrestling promoter. He wrestled professionally in Germany and Japan before signing with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994. He remained a prominent mid-card performer during his seven-year tenure with WCW, including reigns as a one time Cruiserweight Champion, a one time World Television Champion and a one time World Tag Team Champion (with Disco Inferno).

He was the owner, founder and CEO of New Sport Entertainment GmbH which is the company that owns New European Championship Wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1991–1994) ===
Alex was trained by his father Steve Wright, a British professional wrestler. He wrestled his first match in 1991 in Germany when he was sixteen years old. He wrestled in his hometown during his early career and also worked in Japan.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1994–2001) ===

==== Das Wunderkind (1994–1996) ====
Wright was discovered by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in mid-1994 when WCW toured through Germany. He signed a contract with Time Warner, the parent company of WCW, and went through more training at the WCW Power Plant. Wright made his WCW debut, defeating Brady Boone on the September 3rd edition of Saturday Night. He originally wrestled as a babyface and was known as &quot;Das Wunderkind&quot; Alex Wright. His entrance music (&quot;Warped Mind&quot; by Dominic Glynn), was of the techno genre, which was popular in some American and German dance clubs at the time, and he often danced as he walked to the ring or once he got in the ring. His first feud was with Jean-Paul Levesque, whom he defeated at Starrcade in December in both men&#x27;s pay-per-view debut. In his early career, Wright went undefeated in matches against several WCW superstars including Bobby Eaton in January 1995 at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXX&quot; and Paul Roma at &quot;SuperBrawl V&quot; in February &#x27;95. However, the latter saw Roma&#x27;s contract later terminated by WCW because of his stiff performance and his disregard of instructions to put Wright over during the match. WCW had Wright feud on and off with Disco Inferno, another wrestler who danced in or on his way to the ring, with Wright representing modern dancing and music, and Disco representing older styles. Wright would win all of the matches in this feud.

Wright wrestled Arn Anderson for the WCW World Television Championship on an episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; and beat Anderson by DQ. A rematch was scheduled for the next pay-per-view, Slamboree, where Wright suffered his first loss.

Due to WCW&#x27;s partnership with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Wright participated in NJPW&#x27;s Best of the Super Juniors and finished third in the tournament. He started wrestling against fellow cruiserweight and babyface Brian Pillman, whom he defeated in the opening match at The Great American Bash. On the July 16 edition of &quot;Main Event&quot; before Bash at the Beach, Wright teamed with Marcus Bagwell to face Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck in a losing effort. He had encounters with other up and coming WCW stars such as Diamond Dallas Page in August at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXI&quot;. In September 1995 on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Wright wrestled Sabu. Sabu won the match but continued to attack Wright, even putting him through a table. Referee Nick Patrick thus reversed his decision, disqualifying Sabu for his violence and giving the win to Wright. Wright had several matches against Eddie Guerrero, with a very notable match taking place on &quot;The Main Event&quot; before Fall Brawl 1995: War Games, which resulted in a draw. Wright also had several matches in &#x27;95 and &#x27;96 against Dean Malenko. In January 1996, at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXII&quot;, Malenko defeated Wright by pinfall.

At World War 3, Wright took part in the first-ever three-ring 60-man battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Randy Savage. At Starrcade, WCW wrestlers faced NJPW wrestlers in a World Cup of Wrestling. Wright represented WCW against NJPW&#x27;s Koji Kanemoto (for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship even though WCW never announced it as such) but ended up losing the bout to Kanemoto. Wright then began a feud with Dick Slater, to whom he lost at Uncensored in a singles dark match. At Slamboree, Wright was forced by WCW to be teamed with his wrestling and dancing nemesis Disco Inferno in a tag team match against Slater and Eaton. Wright and Disco lost when Disco was pinned. In June of &#x27;96, famed Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki helped put together the World Wrestling Peace Festival, which was held in Los Angeles. Wright wrestled and lost to Chris Benoit on that card. On the August 10 edition of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; that aired immediately before Hog Wild, Wright defeated Bobby Eaton in a rematch.

At World War 3, Wright again participated in a three-ring, 60-man battle royal, with the winner getting a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship. The battle royal was won by The Giant. In January &#x27;97 on &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXIV&quot;, Wright lost to Masa Chono, who had recently come to the U.S. and joined the nWo.

==== Championship reigns (1997) ====
WCW had Wright wrestle in several tag team matches with fellow midcarders, mostly on the losing side. On the May 12, 1997, edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Wright partnered with Ice Train against Konan and Hugh Morrus of the Dungeon of Doom, a match in which Wright openly displayed heelish behavior such as teasing the return of his dance routine that he had temporarily shelved as a babyface, and clashing with Train&#x27;s manager Teddy Long during the match. This culminated in Wright claiming to be unable to continue due to a sudden unexplainable knee injury, angrily confronting Long and then abandoning Ice Train, leaving him to lose the match by submission. Wright was then pushed as a heel for the remainder of 1997, which led to his first championship gold: on the July 28 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, he defeated Chris Jericho to win the Cruiserweight Championship. Wright feuded with Jericho thereafter, including a successful title defense against Jericho at Road Wild, before dropping the title back to Jericho on August 16 edition of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. However, five days later, he defeated Último Dragón on the August 21 &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXV&quot; to win the World Television Championship. Wright was able to successfully defend the TV title against Lord Steven Regal on an episode on &quot;Nitro&quot;.

At Fall Brawl, Wright made a successful title defense against Último Dragón in a rematch before dropping the title to rival Disco Inferno on September 22 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Wright feuded with Steve McMichael after McMichael&#x27;s valet Debra left him and became Wright&#x27;s valet. She ordered the feud and in the rivalry, Wright defeated McMichael at Halloween Havoc, with help from Goldberg, who promptly attacked Wright postmatch. The next month at World War 3, McMichael took out Goldberg prior to their match and Wright was literally dragged to the ring by Debra to wrestle McMichael again, and this time suffered a defeat.

Wright would go on to be managed by Debra for a little while longer. Debra would often try to illegally interfere in matches to help him win, but the plan would usually backfire, causing Wright to lose. He then cut ties with Debra after a string of losses that Wright claimed was her fault.

==== The Dancing Fools (1998) ====
Wright would then begin to patch things up with former rival Disco Inferno as they began teaming in 1998 to form a moderately successful tag team called the Dancing Fools, which at times also featured Japanese wrestler Tokyo Magnum in the role of a tag-along who regularly attempted to imitate their dancing styles. Wright and Inferno feuded with The Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock), including a loss to Grunge and Rocco at Road Wild. Wright then began an angle where he claimed that he was the best WCW wrestler to come out of Europe. British Bulldog, however, disputed Wright&#x27;s proclamation, leading to a feud between Wright and Inferno against Bulldog and Jim Neidhart. The feud culminated at Fall Brawl, where the Dancing Fools lost to Bulldog and Neidhart. After suffering losses, Wright and Inferno split and began singles careers again.

Wright feuded with another fellow European wrestler, Fit Finlay, because he blamed Finlay for ending his father&#x27;s career. Wright took his father&#x27;s revenge from Finlay by beating him at Halloween Havoc.

Wright again competed in the 60-man battle royal at the &#x27;98 edition of World War III, with that year&#x27;s battle royal being won by Kevin Nash.

==== Berlyn (1999–2000) ====
At the beginning of 1999, Wright was kept off WCW television for an extended length of time until May, when Wright came up with his own idea for a gimmick. Promotional spots began appearing on WCW television featuring Wright as a surprising new Rivethead-style character named Berlyn (an intentional misspelling of the city Berlin, the capital of Wright&#x27;s home country Germany), with a black Mohawk and goatee replacing his blond hair. He was clad entirely in black with a long trench coat and arrogantly refused to speak English. He spoke through an interpreter—Uta Ludendorff—and was accompanied to the ring by a large wrestler known as The Wall. The promos coincided with the aftermath of the Columbine school massacre, which threw a hitch in WCW&#x27;s plans. Sensing the unintentional similarities in dress between Berlyn and the teenage killers, WCW delayed the debut of Berlyn for several months. During his debut on August 30 on &quot;Nitro&quot;, he quickly insulted Americans, debuting the character as a heel.

Wright was booked to face Buff Bagwell at Fall Brawl shortly after his debut, but the match did not take place. While WCW claimed that Bagwell had missed his flight, Bagwell was in the arena but did not want to lose. WCW replaced Bagwell with Hacksaw Jim Duggan, and Wright&#x27;s problems continued as Duggan no-sold all of Wright&#x27;s offense and did not cooperate in the ring. Berlyn instead wrestled and defeated Bagwell on the next night&#x27;s &quot;Nitro&quot;. Afterwards, Berlyn attacked Scott Armstrong and began a feud with Brad Armstrong. Alex (as Berlyn) and Brad Armstrong had a match at Halloween Havoc, which Berlyn lost. After the match, Berlyn and The Wall attacked Armstrong. Although Berlyn had been given a push after the fiasco with Duggan and Bagwell, his gimmick was unpopular. WCW furthered the damage by giving The Wall a singles push, leaving Wright to flounder in the mid-card.

On the October 25 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, it was announced that a tournament would be held for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship and the finals would occur at Mayhem. On the following edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Berlyn participated in the tournament but lost his first round match to Vampiro. Berlyn began a small feud with Vampiro and cost him his second round match in the tournament against Buff Bagwell. At Mayhem, Vampiro defeated Berlyn in a Dog Collar match after the Wall turned on Berlyn. Berlyn then feuded with the Wall before again disappearing from WCW television again.

==== Boogie Knights (2000–2001) ====
After several months off from wrestling, Wright returned under his real name on the September 27, 2000, edition of &quot;Thunder&quot; during a match between former partner, Disco Inferno, now renamed &quot;Disqo&quot; (a pun on the name of then-popular R&amp;B singer Sisqó), and Konnan. Wright helped Disqo in getting the victory and the duo reunited as the Boogie Knights. Wright was now completely bald but had returned to his previous dancing mannerisms. The Boogie Knights began a feud with The Filthy Animals while they also feuded with two members of The Natural Born Thrillers (Sean O&#x27;Haire and Mark Jindrak), who were the World Tag Team Champions at the time. At Halloween Havoc, the three teams participated in a triangle match but O&#x27;Haire and Jindrak won the match. Disqo and Wright would then go on to win the World Tag Team Championship from O&#x27;Haire and Jindrak at &quot;Millennium Germany&quot; on November 16. However, four days later on &quot;Nitro&quot;, due to Disqo being out with an injury, Wright and substitute Elix Skipper lost the titles to Chuck Palumbo and Shawn Stasiak, two other members of the Natural Born Thrillers.

Wright then started an angle where he kept KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark) as his bodyguards to squash other cruiserweights. At Mayhem, Wright and KroniK faced Billy Kidman and Rey Misterio, Jr. in a 3-on-2 handicap match. However, KroniK abandoned Wright after the 15 minutes they were paid for expired, leading to him being pinned. Disqo eventually returned from his injury and the Boogie Knights gimmick lasted until WCW was purchased by World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 2001. Wright remained under contract with AOL Time Warner, as his contract was not bought out by the WWF.

=== Retirement ===
Wright fell out of the spotlight after the folding of WCW and has not appeared on American television since then. Wright stated in an interview that WWE could not sign him as he was one of the few who was under contract with AOL Time Warner at the time. He also stated that he took a break from wrestling as he was not happy with the backstage politics in WCW that were happening at the time. In the years following, Wright has stayed away from regular active competition, only wrestling on rare occasions for German wrestling promotions NAWA and GWP.

He wrestled his last match on May 31, 2003 defeating Chris the Bambi Killer for NAWA in Uelzen, Germany. 

After working as a banker and fitness instructor, he opened a pro-wrestling school called &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; in Nuremberg, Germany. Notable students include current WWE wrestler Giovanni Vinci. In 2009, he started his own wrestling promotion called New European Championship Wrestling (NEW).

<text>A privilege is a certain entitlement to immunity granted by the state or another authority to a restricted group, either by birth or on a conditional basis. Land-titles and taxi medallions are examples of transferable privilege – they can be revoked in certain circumstances. In modern democratic states, a &quot;privilege&quot; is conditional and granted only after birth. By contrast, a &quot;right&quot; is an inherent, irrevocable entitlement held by all citizens or all human beings from the moment of birth. Various examples of old common law privilege still exist – to title deeds, for example. Etymologically, a privilege (&quot;privilegium&quot;) means a &quot;private law&quot;, or rule relating to a specific individual or institution.

The principles of conduct that members of the legal profession observe in their practice are called legal ethics.

Boniface&#x27;s abbey of Fulda, to cite an early and prominent example, was granted &quot;privilegium&quot;, setting the abbot in direct contact with the pope, bypassing the jurisdiction of the local bishop.

One of the objectives of the French Revolution was the abolition of privilege. This meant the removal of separate laws for different social classes (nobility, clergy, and ordinary people), instead subjecting everyone to the same common law. Such privileges were abolished by the National Constituent Assembly on August 4, 1789.

<text>The Kikuyu Central Association (KCA), led by James Beauttah and Joseph Kang&#x27;ethe, was a political organisation in colonial Kenya formed in 1924 to act on behalf of the Gĩkũyũ community by presenting their concerns to the British government. One of its greatest grievances was the expropriation of the most productive land by British settlers from African farmers. Most members of the organisation were from the Gĩkũyũ tribe.

KCA was formed after the colonial government banned the earlier Young Kikuyu Association founded by Harry Thuku and the East African Association. In either 1925 or early 1926, Beauttah moved to Uganda, although remained in contact with Kenyatta. When the KCA wrote to Beauttah and asked him to travel to London as their representative, he declined but recommended that Kenyatta who had a good command of the English language go in his place. Kenyatta accepted, probably on the condition that the Association matched his pre-existing wage. He thus became the group&#x27;s secretary. Jomo Kenyatta, later the first president of Kenya, joined it to become its General Secretary in 1927.

The Kikuyu Central Association was banned in 1940 when World War II reached East Africa. Some fighters of the later Mau-Mau still understood their struggle as a continuation of KCA and even called themselves KCA.
The end of World War II, however, saw the new type of African organisation that went beyond tribal boundaries with the rise of the Kenya African Union that later became KANU.
Reasons for formation of KCA:
1)return of African Land 
2)abolition of Kipande system
3)release of Harry Thuku
4)provision of quality education 
5)end forced labour

KCA published the &quot;Muiguithania&quot; (&quot;the reconciler&quot;), a Kikuyu language newspaper. It was banned alongside KCA in 1940.

<text>Masei, Mas&#x27;ei, or Masse (—Hebrew for &quot;journeys,&quot; the second word, and the first distinctive word, in the parashah) is the 43rd weekly Torah portion (, &quot;parashah&quot;) in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading and the 10th and last in the Book of Numbers. The parashah comprises Numbers 33:1–36:13. The parashah discusses the stations of the Israelites&#x27; journeys, instructions for taking the land of Israel, cities for the Levites and refuge, and the daughters of Zelophehad.

It is made up of 5,773 Hebrew letters, 1,461 Hebrew words, 132 verses, and 189 lines in a Torah Scroll (, &quot;Sefer Torah&quot;). Jews generally read it in July or August. The lunisolar Hebrew calendar contains up to 55 Saturdays, the exact number varying between 50 in common years and 54 or 55 in leap years. In some leap years (for example, 2014), parashat Masei is read separately. In most years (all coming years until 2035 in both the Diaspora and Israel), parashat Masei is combined with the previous parashah, Matot, to help achieve the number of weekly readings needed.

==Readings==
In traditional Sabbath Torah reading, the parashah is divided into seven readings, or , &quot;aliyot&quot;.

===First reading: Numbers 33:1–10===
In the first reading, Moses recorded the various journeys of the Israelites from the land of Egypt as directed by God as follows: They journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth to Etham to Pi-hahiroth to Marah to Elim to the Sea of Reeds.

===Second reading: Numbers 33:11–49===
In the second reading, the Israelites journeyed from the Sea of Reeds to the wilderness of Sin to Dophkah to Alush to Rephidim to the wilderness of Sinai to Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth to Rithmah to Rimmon-perez to Libnah to Rissah to Kehelath to Mount Shepher Haradah to Makheloth to Tahath to Terah to Mithkah to Hashmonah to Moseroth to Bene-jaakan to Hor-haggidgad to Jotbath to Abronah to Ezion-geber to Kadesh to Mount Hor. At God&#x27;s command, Aaron ascended Mount Hor and died there, at the age of 123 years. They journeyed from Mount Hor to Zalmonah to Punon to Oboth to Iye-abarim to Dibon-gad to Almon-diblathaim to the hills of Abarim to the steppes of Moab.

===Third reading: Numbers 33:50–34:15===
In the third reading, in the steppes of Moab, God told Moses to direct the Israelites that when they crossed the Jordan into Canaan, they were to dispossess all the inhabitants of the land, destroy all their figured objects, molten images, and cult places, and take possession of and settle in the land. They were to apportion the land among themselves by lot, clan by clan, with the share varying with the size of the group. But God warned that if the Israelites did not dispossess the inhabitants of the land, those whom they allowed to remain would become stings in their eyes and thorns in their sides, and would harass the Israelites in the land, so that God would do to the Israelites what God had planned to do to the inhabitants of the land. God then told Moses to instruct the Israelites in the boundaries of the land, which included the Dead Sea, the wilderness of Zin, the Wadi of Egypt, the Mediterranean Sea, Mount Hor, the eastern slopes of the Sea of Galilee, and the River Jordan. Moses informed the Israelites that the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had received their portions across the Jordan.

===Fourth reading: Numbers 34:16–29===
In the fourth reading, God told Moses the names of the men through whom the Israelites were to apportioned the land: Eleazar, Joshua, and a chieftain named from each tribe.

===Fifth reading: Numbers 35:1–8===
In the fifth reading, God told Moses to instruct the Israelites to assign the Levites out of the other tribes&#x27; holdings towns and pasture land for 2,000 cubits outside the town wall in each direction. The Israelites were to assign the Levites 48 towns in all, of which 6 were to be Cities of Refuge to which a manslayer could flee. The Israelites were to take more towns from the larger tribes and fewer from the smaller.

===Sixth reading: Numbers 35:9–34===
In the sixth reading, three of the six Cities of Refuge were to be designated east of the Jordan, and the other three were to be designated in the land of Canaan. The Cities of Refuge were to serve as places to which a slayer who had killed a person unintentionally could flee from the avenger, so that the slayer might not die without a trial before the assembly. Anyone, however, who struck and killed another with an iron object, stone tool, or wood tool was to be considered a murderer, and was to be put to death. The blood-avenger was to put the murderer to death upon encounter. Similarly, if the killer pushed or struck the victim by hand in hate or hurled something at the victim on purpose and death resulted, the assailant was to be put to death as a murderer. But if the slayer pushed the victim without malice aforethought, hurled an object at the victim unintentionally, or inadvertently dropped on the victim any deadly object of stone, and death resulted—without the victim being an enemy of the slayer and without the slayer seeking the victim harm—then the assembly was to decide between the slayer and the blood-avenger. The assembly was to protect the slayer from the blood-avenger, and the assembly was to restore the slayer to the city of refuge to which the slayer fled, and there the slayer was to remain until the death of the high priest. But if the slayer ever left the city of refuge, and the blood-avenger came upon the slayer outside the city limits, then there would be no bloodguilt if the blood-avenger killed the slayer. The slayer was to remain inside the city of refuge until the death of the high priest, after which the slayer could return to his land. A slayer could be executed only on the evidence of more than one witness. The Israelites were not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer guilty of a capital crime; the murderer was to be put to death. Similarly, the Israelites were not to accept ransom in lieu of flight to a city of refuge, enabling a slayer to return to live on the slayer&#x27;s land before the death of the high priest. Bloodshed polluted the land, and only the blood of the one who shed it could make expiation for the bloodshed.

===Seventh reading: Numbers 36:1–13===
In the seventh reading, kinsmen of Zelophehad, a man of the tribe of Manasseh who had died without a son, appealed to Moses and the chieftains regarding Zelophehad&#x27;s daughters, to whom God had commanded Moses to assign land. Zelophehad&#x27;s kinsmen expressed the concern that if Zelophehad&#x27;s daughters married men from another Israelite tribe, their land would be cut off from Manasseh&#x27;s ancestral portion and be added to the portion of the husbands&#x27; tribe. At God&#x27;s bidding, Moses instructed the Israelites that the daughters of Zelophehad could marry only men from their father&#x27;s tribe, so that no inheritance would pass from one tribe to another. And Moses announced the general rule that every daughter who inherited a share was required to marry someone from her father&#x27;s tribe, in order to preserve each tribe&#x27;s ancestral share. The daughters of Zelophehad did as God had commanded Moses, and they married cousins, men of the tribe of Manasseh.

===Readings according to the triennial cycle===
Jews who read the Torah according to the triennial cycle of Torah reading read the parashah according to a different schedule.

==In inner-biblical interpretation==
The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these Biblical sources:

===Biblical sources on Numbers chapter 35===
The Torah addresses the need for corroborating witnesses three times. Numbers 35:30 instructs that a manslayer may be executed only on the evidence of two or more witnesses. Deuteronomy 17:6 states the same multiple witness requirement for all capital cases. And Deuteronomy 19:15 applies the rule to all criminal offenses.

===Biblical sources on Numbers chapter 36===
The story of the daughters of Zelophehad in Numbers 36 is a sequel of that in Numbers 27. And then Joshua 17:3–6 reports the awarding of lands to the daughters of Zelophehad.

==In early nonrabbinic interpretation==
The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these early nonrabbinic sources:

===Early interpretations of Numbers chapter 35===
With the Cities of Refuge in Numbers 35:6-34, Divine intervention replaces a system of vengeance with a system of justice, much as in the play of the 5th century BCE Greek playwright Aeschylus &quot;The Eumenides&quot;, the third part of &quot;The Oresteia&quot;, the goddess Athena’s intervention helps to replace vengeance with trial by jury.

Philo called the rule of Numbers 35:30 that a judge should not receive the testimony of a single witness &quot;an excellent commandment.&quot; Philo argued first that a person might inadvertently gain a false impression of a thing or be careless about observing and therefore be deceived. Secondly, Philo argued it unjust to trust to one witness against many persons, or indeed against only one individual, for why should the judge trust a single witness testifying against another, rather than the defendant pleading on the defendant&#x27;s own behalf? Where there is no preponderance of opinion for guilt, Philo argued, it is best to suspend judgment.

Similarly, Josephus reported the rule of Numbers 35:30, writing that judges should not credit a single witness, but rather should rely only on three, or two at the least, and only those whose testimony was confirmed by their good lives.

==In classical rabbinic interpretation==
The parashah is discussed in these rabbinic sources from the era of the Mishnah and the Talmud:

===Classical rabbinic interpretations of Numbers chapter 33===
A Midrash taught that God told the Israelites that during all the 40 years that they spent in the wilderness, God did not make it necessary for them to flee. Rather, God cast their enemies down before them. As Deuteronomy 8:15 reports, there were numerous snakes, fiery serpents, and scorpions in the wilderness, but God did not allow them to harm the Israelites. Thus, God told Moses to write down in Numbers 33 the stages by which Israel journeyed in the wilderness, so that they would know the miracles that God had performed for them.
Noting that both Numbers 33:1 and Psalm 77:21 report that the Israelites travelled &quot;under the hand of Moses and Aaron,&quot; a Midrash taught that the similarity served to confirm that God led the Israelites in the wilderness (in the words of Psalm 77:21) &quot;like a flock.&quot;

A Midrash compared the listing of the Israelites&#x27; journeys in Numbers 33 to a king who had a sick son whom he took to a distant place to get cured. On the way back, the king retraced all their previous journeys, noted where his son caught cold and where his son&#x27;s head ached.

A Midrash used the report of Numbers 33:4 to explain why the Israelites had to leave Egypt to conduct their sacrifices. The Midrash interpreted the words of Exodus 8:22, &quot;Lo, if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?&quot; to teach that the Egyptians saw the lamb as a god. Thus, when God told Moses to slay the paschal lamb (as reflected in Exodus 12:21), Moses asked God how he could possibly do so, when the lamb was as Egyptian god. God replied that the Israelites would not depart from Egypt until they slaughtered the Egyptian gods before the Egyptians&#x27; eyes, so that God might teach them that their gods were really nothing at all. And thus God did so, for on the same night that God slew the Egyptian firstborn, the Israelites slaughtered their paschal lambs and ate them. When the Egyptians saw their firstborn slain and their gods slaughtered, they could do nothing, as Numbers 33:4 reports, &quot;While the Egyptians were burying them whom the Lord had smitten among them, even all their firstborn; upon their gods also the Lord executed judgment.&quot;

Reading Numbers 33:4, &quot;Upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments,&quot; the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that when the Israelites left Egypt, God cast down and broke all the Egyptians&#x27; idols.

The Gemara taught that while the Israelites were in the Jordan River with the water standing up in a heap (as reported in Joshua 3:14–17), Joshua told them that they were crossing the Jordan on condition that they would disinherit the inhabitants of the land, as Numbers 33:53 says: &quot;Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you.&quot; Joshua told them that if they did this, it would be well and good; otherwise, the water would return and drown them.

Interpreting Numbers 26:53, 26:55, and 33:54, the Gemara noted a dispute over whether the land of Israel was apportioned according to those who came out of Egypt or according to those who went into the land of Israel. It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Josiah said that the land of Israel was apportioned according to those who came out of Egypt, as Numbers 26:55 says, &quot;according to the names of the tribes of &quot;their fathers&quot; they shall inherit.&quot; The Gemara asked what then to make of Numbers 26:53, which says, &quot;Unto &quot;these&quot; the land shall be divided for an inheritance.&quot; The Gemara proposed that &quot;unto these&quot; meant adults, to the exclusion of minors. But Rabbi Jonathan taught that the land was apportioned according to those who entered the land, for Numbers 26:53 says, &quot;Unto &quot;these&quot; the land shall be divided for an inheritance.&quot; The Gemara posited that according to this view, Numbers 26:55 taught that the manner of inheritance of the land of Israel differed from all other modes of inheritance in the world. For in all other modes of inheritance in the world, the living inherit from the dead, but in this case, the dead inherited from the living. Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar taught a third view—that the land was divided both according to those who left Egypt and also according to those who entered the land of Israel, so as to carry out both verses. The Gemara explained that according to this view, one among those who came out of Egypt received a share among those who came out of Egypt, and one who entered the land of Israel received a share among those who entered the land. And one who belonged to both categories received a share among both categories.

===Classical rabbinic interpretations of Numbers chapter 35===
Chapter 2 of tractate Makkot in the Mishnah, Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, and Babylonian Talmud interpreted the laws of the Cities of Refuge in Exodus 21:12–14, Numbers 35:1–34, Deuteronomy 4:41–43, and 19:1–13.

The Mishnah taught that those who killed in error went into banishment. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would &quot;not&quot; go into banishment if while pulling &quot;up&quot; the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while &quot;raising&quot; a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going &quot;up&quot; a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah&#x27;s general principle was that whenever the death occurred in the course of a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur in the course of a downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.

Rabbi Jose bar Judah taught that to begin with, they sent a slayer to a city of refuge, whether the slayer killed intentionally or not. Then the court sent and brought the slayer back from the city of refuge. The Court executed whomever the court found guilty of a capital crime, and the court acquitted whomever the court found not guilty of a capital crime. The court restored to the city of refuge whomever the court found liable to banishment, as Numbers 35:25 ordained, &quot;And the congregation shall restore him to the city of refuge from where he had fled.&quot; Numbers 35:25 also says, &quot;The manslayer ... shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil,&quot; but the Mishnah taught that the death of a high priest who had been anointed with the holy anointing oil, the death of a high priest who had been consecrated by the many vestments, or the death of a high priest who had retired from his office each equally made possible the return of the slayer. Rabbi Judah said that the death of a priest who had been anointed for war also permitted the return of the slayer. Because of these laws, mothers of high priests would provide food and clothing for the slayers in Cities of Refuge so that the slayers might not pray for the high priest&#x27;s death. If the high priest died at the conclusion of the slayer&#x27;s trial, the slayer did not go into banishment. If, however, the high priests died before the trial was concluded and another high priest was appointed in his stead and then the trial concluded, the slayer returned home after the new high priest&#x27;s death.

A Baraita taught that a disciple in the name of Rabbi Ishmael noted that the words &quot;in all your dwellings&quot; (, &quot;b&#x27;chol moshvoteichem&quot;) appear both in the phrase, &quot;You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath day,&quot; in Exodus 35:3 and in the phrase, &quot;these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings,&quot; in Numbers 35:29. The Baraita reasoned from this similar usage that just as the law prohibits kindling fire at home, so the law also prohibits kindling fire in the furtherance of criminal justice. And thus, since some executions require kindling a fire, the Baraita taught that the law prohibits executions on the Sabbath.

The Gemara read Numbers 35:24–25, “And the congregation shall judge . . . and the congregation shall save,” to requires a court to search for grounds to exonerate the defendant.

The Jerusalem Talmud read the reference to “congregation” in Numbers 35:24–25 to support the proposition that ten comprise a congregation. Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Yasa said in the name of Rabbi Joḥanan that Scripture uses the word “congregation” in Numbers 35:24–25, “The congregation shall judge, and the congregation shall rescue,” and also in Numbers 14:27, “How long shall this wicked congregation murmur against me?” and argued that just as the word “congregation” in Numbers 14:27 refers to ten persons (the twelve spies minus Joshua and Caleb), the word “congregation” in Numbers 35:24–25, must refer to ten persons, and thus judgments needed to take place in the presence of ten.

The Gemara read Numbers 35:30 to limit the participation of witnesses and Rabbinical students in trials. The Mishnah taught that in monetary cases, all may argue for or against the defendant, but in capital cases, all may argue in favor of the defendant, but not against the defendant. The Gemara asked whether the reference to &quot;all&quot; in this Mishnah included even the witnesses. Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Judah and the Rabbis disagreed to some degree. The Gemara read the words of Numbers 35:30, &quot;But one witness shall not testify against any person,&quot; to indicate that a witness cannot participate in a trial—either for acquittal or condemnation—beyond providing testimony. Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Judah taught that a witness could argue for acquittal, but not for condemnation. Rav Papa taught that the word &quot;all&quot; means to include not the witnesses, but the Rabbinical students who attended trials, and thus was not inconsistent with the views of Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Judah or of the Rabbis. The Gemara explained the reasoning of Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Judah for his view that witnesses may argue in favor of the accused as follows: Numbers 35:30 says, &quot;But one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.&quot; Hence, according to the reasoning of Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Judah, only &quot;so that he die&quot; could the witness not argue, but the witness could argue for acquittal. And Resh Lakish explained the reasoning of the Rabbis forbidding a witness to argue in favor of the accused as follows: The Rabbis reasoned that if a witness could argue the case, then the witness might seem personally concerned in his testimony (for a witness contradicted by subsequent witnesses could be subject to execution for testifying falsely). The Gemara then asked how the Rabbis interpreted the words, &quot;so that he die&quot; (which seems to indicate that the witness may not argue only when it leads to death). The Gemara explained that the Rabbis read those words to apply to the Rabbinical students (constraining the students not to argue for condemnation). A Baraita taught that they did not listen to a witnesses who asked to make a statement in the defendant&#x27;s favor, because Numbers 35:30 says, &quot;But one witness shall not testify.&quot; And they did not listen to a Rabbinical student who asked to argue a point to the defendant&#x27;s disadvantage, because Numbers 35:30 says, &quot;One shall not testify against any person that he die&quot; (but a student could do so for acquittal).

The Gemara cited the Torah&#x27;s requirement for corroborating witnesses to support the Mishnah&#x27;s prohibition of circumstantial evidence in capital cases. The Mishnah reported that they admonished witnesses in capital cases not to testify based on conjecture (that is, circumstantial evidence) or hearsay, for the court would scrutinize the witnesses&#x27; evidence by cross-examination and inquiry. The Gemara reported that the Rabbis taught that the words &quot;based on conjecture&quot; in the Mishnah meant that the judge told the witness that if the witness saw the defendant running after the victim into a ruin, and the witness pursued the defendant and found the defendant with bloody sword in hand and the victim writhing in agony, then the judge would tell the witness that the witness saw nothing (and did not actually witness a murder). It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach said that he once did see a man pursuing his fellow into a ruin, and when Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach ran after the man and saw him, bloody sword in hand and the murdered man writhing, Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach exclaimed to the man, &quot;Wicked man, who slew this man? It is either you or I! But what can I do, since your blood (that is, life) does not rest in my hands, for it is written in the Torah (in Deuteronomy 17:6) &#x27;At the mouth of two witnesses ... shall he who is to die be put to death&#x27;? May He who knows one&#x27;s thoughts (that is, God) exact vengeance from him who slew his fellow!&quot; The Gemara reported that before they moved from the place, a serpent bit the murderer and he died.

In the Mishnah, Rabbi Jose said that a malefactor was never put to death unless two witnesses had duly pre-admonished the malefactor, as Deuteronomy 17:6 prescribes, &quot;At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be put to death.&quot; And the Mishnah reported another interpretation of the words, &quot;At the mouth of two witnesses,&quot; was that the Sanhedrin would not hear evidence from the mouth of an interpreter.

Rav Zutra bar Tobiah reported that Rav reasoned that Deuteronomy 17:6 disqualified isolated testimony when it prescribes that &quot;at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.&quot; This special admonition against one witness would seem redundant to the earlier context, &quot;At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be put to death,&quot; so it was taken to mean that individual witnesses who witnesses the crime, one by one, in isolation from each other, were insufficient to convict. Similarly, a Baraita taught that Deuteronomy 17:6 prescribes, &quot;At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death,&quot; to cover instances where two persons see the wrongdoer, one from one window and the other from another window, without seeing each other, in which case the evidence could not be joined to form a set of witnesses sufficient to convict. Even if they both witnessed the offence from the same window, one after the other, their testimony could not be joined to form a set of witnesses sufficient to convict.

Rabbi Ishmael the son of Rabbi Jose commanded Rabbi Judah the Prince not to engage in a lawsuit against three parties, for one would be an opponent and the other two would be witnesses for the other side.

Discussing the need for two witnesses, the Gemara related an incident where Tuveya sinned with immorality, and Zigud testified about it before Rav Pappa. Rav Pappa instructed that Zigud be lashed. When Zigud complained to Rav Pappa that Tuveya sinned and Zigud was lashed, Rav Pappa replied that Deuteronomy 19:15 enjoins, &quot;One witness shall not rise up against a person,&quot; and Zigud testified against Tuveya alone, thereby merely giving Tuveya a bad reputation. Rabbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said that Rav said that although one who sees another committing a sin should not testify alone against the sinner, the witness is nonetheless permitted to hate the sinner, as Exodus 23:5 states, &quot;If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying under its load,&quot; and the Gemara interpreted this verse to refer to a case like this one where a witness saw a sinner perform a licentious matter. Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, asked Rav Ashi whether one who saw someone sin may tell one&#x27;s teacher, so that the teacher too would hate the sinner. Rav Ashi replied that if the student knew that teacher trusted the student as much as two witnesses, and therefore the teacher would accept the student&#x27;s statement, then the student should tell the teacher, but if the teacher did not trust the student as much as two witnesses, then the student should not tell the teacher.

Rabbi Ishmael taught that the avoidance of danger to one’s own life takes precedence over the prohibition of shedding blood in Numbers 35:34. Rabbi Ishmael cited Exodus 22:1, in which the right to defend one’s home at night takes precedence over the prohibition of killing, to support the proposition that the avoidance of danger to human life takes precedence over the laws of the Sabbath. For in Exodus 22:1, in spite of all the other considerations, it is lawful to kill the thief. So even if in the case of the thief—where doubt exists whether the thief came to take money or life, and even though Numbers 35:34 teaches that the shedding of blood pollutes the land, so that the Divine Presence departs from Israel—yet it was lawful to save oneself at the cost of the thief’s life, how much more may one suspend the laws of the Sabbath to save human life.

===Classical rabbinic interpretations of Numbers chapter 36===
Chapter 8 of tractate Bava Batra in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud and chapter 7 of tractate Bava Batra in the Tosefta interpreted the laws of inheritance in Numbers 27:1–11 and 36:1–9.

Rava interpreted the words &quot;This is the thing&quot; in Numbers 36:6 to teach that the law prohibiting intermarriage between the tribes held only for the generation of Zelophehad&#x27;s daughters.

A Baraita taught that Zelophehad&#x27;s daughters were wise, Torah students, and righteous. And a Baraita taught that Zelophehad&#x27;s daughters were equal in merit, and that is why the order of their names varies between Numbers 27:1 and 36:11. According to the Gemara, Zelophehad&#x27;s daughters demonstrated their righteousness in Numbers 36:10–11 by marrying men who were fitting for them.

===Medieval interpretations of Numbers chapter 35===
In the Torah’s teaching (in Exodus 21:12–14, Numbers 35:10–29, and Deuteronomy 4:41–42 and 19:1–13) that one who killed another unintentionally did not incur capital punishment, Baḥya ibn Paquda found proof that an essential condition of liability for punishment is the association of mind and body in a forbidden act—that liability requires both intention and action.

===Modern interpretations of Numbers chapter 33===

Archeologists Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University and Neil Asher Silberman argued that the place Sukkot mentioned in Exodus 12:37 and Numbers 33:5 is probably the Hebrew form of the Egyptian &quot;Tjkw&quot;, a name referring to a place or an area in the eastern Nile Delta that appears in Egyptian texts from the time of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt, the dynasty of Ramesses II. Finkelstein and Silberman reported that a late thirteenth century BCE Egyptian papyrus recorded that the commanders of the forts along the delta&#x27;s eastern border closely monitored the movements of foreigners there, saying: &quot;We have completed the entry of the tribes of the Edomite Shasu (that is, Bedouin) through the fortress of Merneptah-Content-with-Truth, which is in &quot;Tjkw&quot;, to the pools of Pr-Itm which (are) in &quot;Tjkw&quot; for the sustenance of their flocks.&quot; And Finkelstein and Silberman reported that the abundant Egyptian sources describing the time of the New Kingdom of Egypt in general and the thirteenth century in particular make no reference to the Israelites. Finkelstein and Silberman also noted that according to the Biblical narrative, the Israelites camped at Kadesh-barnea for 38 of the 40 years of their wanderings. Numbers 34 makes clear Kadesh&#x27;s general location from its description of the southern border of the land of Israel, and archaeologists have identified it with the large and well-watered oasis of Ein el-Qudeirat in eastern Sinai, on the border between modern Israel and Egypt. The name Kadesh was probably preserved over the centuries in the name of a nearby smaller spring called Ein Qadis. A small mound with the remains of a Late Iron Age fort stands at the center of this oasis. Yet repeated excavations and surveys throughout the area have not provided even the slightest evidence for activity in the Late Bronze Age, not even a single sherd left by a tiny fleeing band of frightened refugees. Finkelstein and Silberman concluded that based on the evidence at the specific sites where Numbers 33 says that the Israelites camped for extended periods during their wandering in the desert (and where some archaeological indication—if present—would almost certainly be found), a mass Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible.

===Modern interpretations of Numbers chapter 35===
Tamara Cohn Eskenazi wrote that Biblical laws required Israelites to act as redeemers for relatives in four situations: (1) redemption of land in Leviticus 25:25–34, (2) redemption of persons from slavery, especially in Leviticus 25:47–50, (3) redemption of objects dedicated to the sanctuary in Leviticus 27:9–28, and (4) avenging the blood of a murdered relative in Numbers 35.

Gunther Plaut argued that the discussions of Cities of Refuge in Numbers 35:9–34 and Deuteronomy 4:41–43 and 19:1–13 were composed during a later, settled period, in order to accommodate the disappearance of local altars that previously served as places of refuge. Noting that Numbers 35:25 provided that the person who had committed manslaughter would remain in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest, Plaut argued that only death could compensate for the loss of the victim&#x27;s life, and thus the death of the High Priest became the symbol of communal expiation.
Explaining the origins of the law that one can see in the Cities of Refuge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that early forms of legal procedure were grounded in vengeance. Roman law and German law started from the blood feud, which led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off. Holmes reported that in Anglo-Saxon practice, the feud was pretty well broken up by the time of William the Conqueror. The killings and house-burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson, and then the legal actions now familiar to lawyers.

H. Clay Trumbull argued that the &quot;redeemer&quot; (, &quot;goel&quot;) in Numbers 35:12 was responsible for securing for the victim&#x27;s family an equivalent of their loss of blood—the loss of life—by other blood, or by an agreed-upon payment for its value. Trumbull taught that the redeemer&#x27;s mission was &quot;not vengeance, but equity. He was not an avenger, but a redeemer, a restorer, a balancer.&quot;

In an echo of the requirement in Numbers 35:30 that the Israelites could execute a manslayer only with the evidence of two or more witnesses, of the United States Constitution provides that the government may convict a person of treason only with the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or a confession in open court. A then-recent precursor of the Constitution&#x27;s provision appeared in 1776 in the Laws of Virginia, which provided that defendants be &quot;convicted of open deed by the evidence of two sufficient and lawful witnesses, or their own voluntary confession.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;An Act Declaring What Shall Be Treason, Laws of Virginia, 1776, Hening 9:168, in, e.g., Philip B.

<text>In Judaism, Rosh Chodesh or Rosh Hodesh (; trans. &quot;Beginning of the Month&quot;; lit. &quot;Head of the Month&quot;) is a minor holiday observed at the beginning of every month in the Hebrew calendar, marked by the birth of a new moon. Rosh Chodesh is observed for either one or two days, depending on whether the previous month contained 29 or 30 days.

==Origin==
The Book of Exodus establishes the new moon of Nisan, which is the first month of Aviv, as the beginning of the Hebrew calendar:

In the Book of Numbers, God speaks of the celebration of the new moon to Moses:
In , both new and full moon are mentioned as a time of recognition by the Hebrews:
In the Bible, Rosh Chodesh is often referred to simply as &quot;Chodesh&quot;, as the Hebrew word &quot;chodesh&quot; can mean both &quot;month&quot; and &quot;new month&quot;.

==Declaring the month==

Judaism uses a lunisolar calendar, so Rosh Chodesh is celebrated in connection with the date of the new moon. Originally, the date of Rosh Chodesh was confirmed on the testimony of witnesses observing the new moon, a procedure known as &quot;kiddush hachodesh&quot; (sanctification of the month). After the Sanhedrin declared Rosh Chodesh for either a full (30-day) or defective (29-day) month, news of it would then be communicated throughout Israel and the diaspora.

This system was dependent on the functioning of the Sanhedrin to declare the month, and to communicate this month to far-flung Jewish communities. In the 4th century CE, this became impossible and instead a fixed calendar of 29- and 30-day months (see Hebrew calendar for details) was instituted by Hillel II. At the end of a 29-day month, Rosh Chodesh is celebrated for one day, on the first day of the new month. At the end of a 30-day month, Rosh Chodesh is celebrated for two days - the 30th day of the previous month, and the first day of the new month.

==Observance==
===Announcement===
Despite the existence of a fixed calendar, Rosh Chodesh is still announced in synagogues on the preceding Shabbat (called Shabbat Mevarchim — The Shabbat of Blessing [the new month]). The announcement is made after the reading of the sefer Torah, before returning it to the Torah ark. The name of the new month, and the day of the week on which it falls, is given during the prayer. Some communities customarily precede the prayer by an announcement of the exact date and time of the new moon, referred to as the &quot;molad&quot;, or &quot;birth&quot;. Rosh Chodesh Tishrei (which is also Rosh Hashanah) is never announced, although according to the fixed Jewish calendar, it is the determining factor for all of the postponements (Dehioth) which determine when each Rosh Chodesh is actually observed.

===Traditional observances===
On Rosh Chodesh, the prayer Yaaleh V&#x27;Yavo is added to the Ritzeh (or &quot;Avodah&quot;) blessing of the Amidah. In the morning service &quot;half Hallel&quot; (Psalms 113–118, with two paragraphs omitted) is recited (except on Rosh Chodesh Tevet, which is during Chanukkah, when the full Hallel is recited). The Torah is read, specifically which includes the sacrifices of Rosh Chodesh. An additional prayer service, called Mussaf, is added to commemorate the Rosh Chodesh sacrifices in the Temple. Its middle blessing begins &quot;Roshei Chadashim&quot;. After the service, many recite Psalm 104.

If Rosh Chodesh falls on Shabbat, the regular Torah reading is supplemented with a reading of Numbers 28:9-15. The German custom is to sing the Half Kaddish preceding Maftir to a special tune. In most months (if it does not coincide with another special Haftarah), the regular Haftarah is replaced by a special Rosh Chodesh Haftarah. The &quot;Mussaf&quot; prayer is also modified when Rosh Chodesh falls on Shabbat. The central benediction is replaced with an alternative version (&quot;Ata Yatzarta&quot;) that mentions both the Shabbat and Rosh Chodesh. If Rosh Chodesh falls on a Sunday and not on the Sabbath, the special Haftarah of &quot;Mahar Chodesh&quot; (&quot;Tomorrow is the New Moon&quot;, I Samuel 20:18-42) is read if it does not coincide with another special Haftarah.

Kiddush Levanah is recited soon after Rosh Chodesh, although most communities wait until three or seven days after the Molad (the time of the &quot;birth&quot; of the new moon). It is common to wait until Saturday night to recite Kiddush Levanah.

Many have a custom to eat a special meal in honor of Rosh Chodesh, as recommended by the Shulchan Aruch. This gives one the opportunity to recite the &quot;Ya&#x27;a&#x27;le Ve-Yavo&quot; in Birkat Hamazon. Some Hasidic Jews sing Psalm 104 during this meal.

===Work===
Jews nowadays generally treat Rosh Chodesh as barely different from any other weekday (except for expansion of the prayer service). The Torah does not prohibit work (&quot;melacha&quot;) on Rosh Chodesh, and the Talmud states that work is permitted on Rosh Chodesh. The Jerusalem Talmud states that women refrain from work on Rosh Hodesh, but only by custom as opposed to law. This custom is recorded in the Shulchan Aruch, but does not seem to be commonly practised in modern times.

Yet for much of early Jewish history, Rosh Chodesh was observed much more seriously. In some Biblical sources, Rosh Hodesh is described as a day when business is not conducted and which seems to have been devoted to worship and feasting. This is corroborated by an inscription from the Arad ostraca (c. 600 BCE) in which a military commander is told to deliver goods on the first of the month, but only to record this delivery in writing on the second of the month (seemingly because writing was considered a forbidden melakha). In the Second Temple period, too, Rosh Chodesh was considered a day of rest according to some sources. In the Talmudic period, one passage considered Rosh Chodesh to be a day on which work ceased (&quot;bittul&quot;); another passage suggests that work ceased (&quot;bittul&quot;) but was not forbidden (&quot;assur&quot;). To explain the current acceptance of working on Rosh Chodesh, Shaagat Aryeh proposed that there indeed was a general prohibition on Rosh Chodesh work while the Temple stood, as the mussaf sacrifice was offered on behalf of the entire people, and a general principle exists that a person may not work on a day when their sacrifice is offered.

===Rosh Chodesh and women===
According to the Talmud, women do not engage in work on Rosh Chodesh. Rashi, in commenting on this passage, delineates the activities from which they must refrain: spinning, weaving, and sewing—the skills that women contributed to the building of the Mishkan (Tabernacle). The Shulchan Aruch writes that &quot;Those women whose custom is not to do work on [Rosh Chodesh] have a good custom&quot;.

The midrash &quot;Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer&quot; gives a historical explanation for this practice:

Aaron argued with himself, saying: &quot;If I say to Israel, &#x27;Give ye to me gold and silver,&#x27; they will bring it immediately; but behold I will say to them, &#x27;Give ye to me the earrings of your wives and of your sons,&#x27; and forthwith the matter will fail,&quot; as it is said, &quot;And Aaron said to them, &#x27;Break off the golden rings.&#x27;&quot; The women heard (this), but they were unwilling to give their earrings to their husbands; but they said to them: &quot;Ye desire to make a graven image of a molten image without any power in it to deliver.&quot; The Holy One, blessed be He, gave the women their reward in this world and the world to come. What reward did He give them in this world? That they should observe the new moons more stringently than the men, and what reward will He give them in the world to come? They are destined to be renewed like the new moons, as it is said: &quot;Who satisfieth thy years with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.&quot;

In modern times, female-centered Rosh Chodesh observances vary from group to group, but many are centered on small gatherings of women, called Rosh Chodesh groups. There is often a particular interest in the Shekinah, considered by the kabbalah to be a feminine aspect of God. These groups engage in a wide variety of activities that center around issues important to Jewish women, depending on the preference of the group&#x27;s members. Many Rosh Chodesh groups explore spirituality, religious education, ritual, health issues, music, chanting, art, and/or cooking. Some groups also choose to educate young Jewish women in their community about sexuality, self-image, and other women&#x27;s mental and physical health issues.

Miriam&#x27;s cup (for the prophet Miriam) originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with mayim hayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of guided meditation. Some seders (including the original Women&#x27;s Seder, but not limited to women-only seders) now set Miriam&#x27;s cup as well as the traditional cup for the prophet Elijah, sometimes accompanied by a ritual to honor Miriam. Miriam&#x27;s cup is linked to the &quot;midrash&quot; of Miriam&#x27;s well, which &quot;is a rabbinic legend that tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their 40 years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt&quot;.

<text>Nathan Bedford Forrest III (April 6, 1905 – June 13, 1943) was an American brigadier general of the United States Army Air Forces who was the first American general to be killed in action in the European Theater of World War II. Forrest was a great-grandson of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and an early officer of the United States Army Air Corps in 1929. Forrest was killed in action when his plane was shot down during a raid over Nazi Germany in June 1943.

==Early life and education==

Nathan Bedford Forrest III was born on April 6, 1905 in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Nathan Bedford Forrest II and Mattie Patterson (Patton). 
His paternal great-grandfather was Nathan Bedford Forrest, the famed Confederate general and leader of the Ku Klux Klan. On November 22, 1930, he married Frances Brassler. According to the Arlington National Cemetery website, he had no children, making him the final male Forrest in his great-grandfather&#x27;s legitimate direct line.

==Career==
Forrest graduated from West Point in 1928 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the cavalry of the United States Army. In 1929, he transferred to the Air Corps, gaining rank rapidly and graduating from the Air Corps Tactical School in December 1939. Promoted to brigadier general in 1942, Forrest was serving as chief of staff of the Second Air Force when he flew missions as an observer with the Eighth Air Force in England.

==Death==
On June 13, 1943, Forrest was reported missing in action while leading a bombing raid on the German submarine yards at Kiel when his B-17 Flying Fortress was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The other squadron members reported seeing parachutes and hoped the general had survived. However, on September 23, 1943, Forrest&#x27;s corpse washed up near a seaplane base on the island of Rügen in Germany. He was buried on September 28, 1943, in a small cemetery near Wiek.

His family was presented his Distinguished Service Cross, which he was awarded posthumously for staying at the controls of his B-17 bomber while his crew bailed out. The plane exploded before Forrest could bail out. By the time the &quot;Seenotdienst&quot; (the German air-sea rescue) arrived, only one of the crew was still alive in the water.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation===

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Brigadier General Nathan Bedford Forrest, III (ASN: 0-17124), United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Chief of Staff for the SECOND Air Force and an Observer in a B-17 Heavy Bomber of the EIGHTH Air Force, while participating in a bombing mission on 13 June 1943, against enemy ground targets in the European Theater of Operations. While in command of a bomber division of an operational bombing mission against a vital military target, the formation was subjected to heavy antiaircraft fire and enemy aircraft attacks, during which a number of the planes in the division were shot down, and the plane in which General Forrest was flying was damaged before reaching the target. In the face of the strongest opposition yet encountered on a bombing mission, and with complete disregard for personal safety, General Forrest led his command to the target and accomplished his mission from which he did not return. His leadership, skill, and extraordinary heroism on this occasion were an inspiration to all officers and men of the Air Force in this theater, and reflect the highest credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of the United States. General Forrest has been officially reported as missing in action.

==Legacy==
In 1947, two years after the war ended, his widow requested that he be returned to the United States and buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was buried in Section 11 at Arlington on November 15, 1949.

==Dates of rank==
* June 9, 1928 second lieutenant
* February 4, 1934, first lieutenant
* June 9, 1938, captain
* January 31, 1941, major

==In popular culture==
Alternate history novelist Harry Turtledove makes Forrest III a significant character in the &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series, and a minor character in the standalone novel &quot;Joe Steele&quot;. The &quot;Southern Victory&quot; version (an officer of a still-extant Confederacy, which has become analogous to Nazi Germany), leads a July 20-style coup attempt against Hitleresque Confederate President Jake Featherston.

<text>Kępno is a town in south-central Poland. Kępno is located in the historical Wieluń Land. It lies on the outskirts of the Greater Poland Voivodeship, bordering the historical region of Silesia and the Łódź Voivodeship. As of December 31, 2009 Kępno had a population of 14,760. One popular attraction in Kępno is the Rynek (market square).

==History==

The history of Kępno dates back to a medieval Polish stronghold. The oldest known mention of Kępno comes from 1282, when it was the place of signing of the Treaty of Kępno, between dukes of fragmented Poland, Przemysł II, Duke of Greater Poland and Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania. In 1283 it enjoyed town rights. Initially a royal city of Poland, in 1365 it was granted by King Casimir III the Great to knight and noble . Administratively located in the Sieradz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown, it became a village again. It regained town rights in 1660, by decision of King John II Casimir of Poland. Protestants from nearby Silesia as well as Jews settled in Kępno in the 17th century. One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

Kępno was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the 1793 Second Partition of Poland. Administered within South Prussia from 1793 to 1807, it was part of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw from 1807 to 1815. As &quot;Kempen&quot;, it was restored to Prussia in the 1815 Congress of Vienna and administered within the Grand Duchy of Posen (until 1848) and the Province of Posen, within which it was the seat of the district Kempen in Posen. The town was a 19th-century shtetl. The majority of the Jews left the city during the second half of the 19th century because of the epidemics (cholera, etc.) and the poor living conditions. They left mainly for Wrocław and surroundings, Berlin, and the Americas. Kempen (Kepno) immigrants were the first Jews to settle in Guatemala, and formed the basis of the German-Jewish community there. In the meantime, the Polish population was subject to Germanisation policies. Since the mid-19th century, to resist Germanisation, Poles founded various organizations, including industrial and cultural societies, printing houses and a local branch of the &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society. In the early 20th century local Poles protested against Germanisation policies.
In 1918 Poland regained independence after World War I and the Greater Poland Uprising broke out, the aim of which was to reunite the region with Poland. In response the Germans placed over 1,000 &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; troops in the town and persecuted the local Polish population. In January 1919, the Germans interned six leading local Polish activists in Świętoszów. Despite their plans, the Polish insurgents did not try to recapture the town, however, it was still restored to Poland on 17 January 1920.

Following the invasion of Poland and the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Kępno was occupied by the Wehrmacht and on September 6–7, 1939 the &quot;Einsatzgruppe III&quot; entered the town to commit atrocities against Poles. Some Poles from Kępno were murdered by German troops already on September 7, 1939, in the nearby village of Wylazłów. The town was annexed by Nazi Germany, renamed &quot;Kempen&quot; and administered as part of the county or district (&quot;kreis&quot;) of the same name within Reichsgau Wartheland. Its population was subject to segregation, Germanisation, confiscation of property, arrests, expulsions, deportations to forced labour, imprisonment in concentration camps and executions. The Germans established and operated a Nazi prison in the town. Polish monuments were destroyed. The Polish resistance movement was organized in Kępno in November 1939. Red Army troops took the town on January 21, 1945, and with the end of the war, the town returned to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The Polish resistance movement remained active in the town, and in September 1945 it captured the local communist police station and liberated the prisoners.

==Cuisine==
Kępno is one of the production sites of the Greater Poland liliput cheese (&quot;ser liliput wielkopolski&quot;), a traditional regional Polish cheese, protected as a traditional food by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.

<text>Dinah Maria Craik (; born Dinah Maria Mulock, often credited as Miss Mulock or Mrs. Craik; 20 April 1826 – 12 October 1887) was an English novelist and poet. She is best remembered for her novel, &quot;John Halifax, Gentleman&quot;, which presents the mid-Victorian ideals of English middle-class life.

==Life==
Mulock was born at Stoke-upon-Trent to Dinah and Thomas Mulock and raised in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, where her father was minister of a small independent nonconformist congregation. Her childhood and early youth were affected by his unsettled fortunes, but she gained a good education from various quarters and felt called to be a writer.

She arrived in London about 1846, at much the same time as two friends, Alexander Macmillan and Charles Edward Mudie. Introduced by Camilla Toulmin to Westland Marston, she rapidly made friends in London and found great encouragement for her stories for the young. In 1865, she married George Lillie Craik, a partner with Alexander Macmillan in the publishers Macmillan &amp; Company, and nephew of George Lillie Craik. They adopted a foundling baby girl, Dorothy, in 1869.

At Shortlands, near Bromley, Kent, while preparing for Dorothy&#x27;s wedding, Craik died of heart failure on 12 October 1887, aged 61. Her last words were said to have been: &quot;Oh, if I could live four weeks longer! but no matter, no matter!&quot; Her final book, &quot;An Unknown Country&quot;, appeared with Macmillan in 1887, the year of her death. Dorothy married Alexander Pilkington in 1887, but they divorced in 1911 and she later married Captain Richards of Macmine Castle. She and Alexander had a son, John Mulock Pilkington. He married Freda Roskelly and had a son and daughter with her.

==Works==
Mulock&#x27;s early success began with the novel &quot;Cola Monti&quot; (1849). In the same year she produced her first three-volume novel, &quot;The Ogilvies,&quot; to great success. It was followed in 1850 by &quot;Olive&quot;, then by &quot;The Head of the Family&quot; in 1851 and &quot;Agatha&#x27;s Husband&quot; in 1853, in which the author used her recollections of East Dorset. Mulock published the fairy story &quot;Alice Learmont&quot; in 1852, and collected numerous short stories from periodicals under the title of &quot;Avillion and other Tales&quot; in 1853. A similar collection appeared in 1857 under the title &quot;Nothing New&quot;.

Well established in public favour as an author, Mulock took a cottage at Wildwood, North End, Hampstead and joined an extensive social circle. Her personal attractions were considerable at the time; people kindly ascribed to her simple cordiality, staunch friendliness and thorough goodness of heart. In 1857 she published the work by which she is mainly remembered, &quot;John Halifax, Gentleman&quot;, a presentation of the ideals of English middle-class life. Mulock&#x27;s next important work, &quot;A Life for a Life&quot; (1859), made more money and was perhaps more widely read than &quot;John Halifax&quot; at the time. It was followed by &quot;Mistress and Maid&quot; (1863) and &quot;Christian&#x27;s Mistake&quot; (1865), and by didactic works such as &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Thoughts about Women&quot; and &quot;Sermons out of Church.&quot; Another collection, &quot;The Unkind Word and Other Stories&quot;, included a scathing criticism of Benjamin Heath Malkin for overworking his son Thomas, a child prodigy who died at the age of seven. Craik criticizes Malkin for acceding to Thomas&#x27;s requests to be educated at an early age, believing it contributed to his death, but also admits that Malkin&#x27;s other sons did well in life.
Later Craik returned to more fanciful tales and achieved success with &quot;The Little Lame Prince&quot; (1874). In 1881 she published a collection of earlier poems entitled &quot;Poems of Thirty Years, New and Old&quot;; some, such as &quot;Philip my King&quot; were addressed to her godson Philip Bourke Marston. &quot;Douglas, Douglas, Tender and True&quot; achieved wide popularity.

==Reception==
Richard Garnett holds that &quot;the genuine passion that filled her early works of fiction had not unnaturally faded out of middle life,&quot; to be replaced by didacticism and an increase in self-awareness. Garnett judges Craik&#x27;s poetry as &quot;a woman&#x27;s poems, tender, domestic, and sometimes enthusiastic, always genuine song, and the product of real feeling.&quot;

American composer Emily Bruce Roelofson used Craik&#x27;s text for her song &quot;O Heart, My Heart&quot;.

<doc id="829423" wikidata="Q7880408" url="?curid=829423" title="The Nine Days">
<text>The Nine Days of Av are a time of commemoration and spiritual observance in Judaism during the first nine days of the Jewish month of Av (corresponding to July/August). The Nine Days begin on Rosh Chodesh Av (&quot;First of Av&quot;) and culminates on the public fast day of Tisha B&#x27;Av (&quot;Ninth of Av&quot;).

The Nine Days are part of a larger period of time known as The Three Weeks, which begin with the public fast day of the Seventeenth of Tammuz—commemorated in Judaism for the time when the forces of Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia broke through the defensive walls surrounding Jerusalem, generally accepted as happening in 586 BCE—and end with the public fast day of Tisha B&#x27;Av—when, according to the Mishna, the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple in 597 BCE and when the Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. During the entire Three Weeks, certain activities are abstained by Jews observing Jewish law in order to commemorate, remember and inspire mourning over destruction of the Temple.

The Talmud says, &quot;When the month of Av begins, we [i.e. Jews] reduce our joy.&quot; The Nine Days inaugurates an even greater level of communal and personal mourning in recognition of the many tragedies and calamities that befell the Jewish people at this time. The Nine Days are considered an inauspicious time even in our day and age.

Rather than view the Three Weeks and the Nine Days as times of punishment and self-mortification, some Jewish teachings see them as opportunities for introspection, repentance, and forging a closer relationship with God. The Talmud states that all who mourn the destruction of Jerusalem will merit to rejoice in its rebuilding. The Sages also teach that the Jewish Messiah will be born on Tisha B&#x27;Av. It is that promise of redemption which nevertheless makes this period one of hope and anticipation in Judaism.

== Mourning observances ==
===Levels of mourning===
The mourning observances during the Three Weeks are divided into four levels, increasing in intensity:
# From the Seventeenth of Tammuz until the end of Tammuz (see also &quot;The Three Weeks&quot;)
# From Rosh Chodesh Av until the week in which Tisha B&#x27;Av falls
# The week in which Tisha B&#x27;Av falls
# Tisha B&#x27;Av itself

During the entire Three Weeks, Ashkenazi Jews refrain from making weddings, playing or listening to music, and shaving or taking haircuts. Sephardi Jews begin these mourning observances on Rosh Chodesh Av, although Sephardi Jews generally do not hold weddings at all during the Three Weeks because they are an inauspicious time. Engagements are permitted. The custom is also to avoid saying the blessing over a new fruit on a weekday (one may do so on Shabbat), and making a major purchase such as a new home or car.

During the Nine Days, these additional activities are forbidden by Jewish law because they bring joy:
* Home improvements, painting and new construction
* Planting trees, flowers or grass
* Laundering clothes, towels, tablecloths and bed linens
* Wearing new or freshly laundered clothing
* Making or buying new clothes, towels, tablecloths and bed linens
* Eating meat or poultry
* Drinking wine or grape juice
* Bathing for pleasure (for example a hot tub, hanging out in the pool) 
* Swimming or recreational sports for the purpose of leisure
* Listening to music

On Tisha B&#x27;Av itself, these additional prohibitions are observed:
* Eating and drinking
* Bathing
* Applying oils or perfumes
* Wearing leather shoes
* Sexual activity
* Greeting people
* Learning Torah [except for certain parts of the Scriptures and Talmud which deal with mourning or the destruction of the Temples].

For some restrictions, Jewish law makes a distinction between the beginning of the Nine Days and the week in which Tisha B&#x27;Av falls. (The new week begins on Saturday night). For example, the Ashkenazic custom is to permit nail trimming up until the week in which Tisha B&#x27;Av falls.

===Meat and wine===
The restrictions against eating meat and drinking wine, besides reducing a person&#x27;s pleasure, recall the cessation of the &quot;Korban Tamid&quot; (daily animal sacrifice in the Jewish Temples in Jerusalem) and the &quot;Nesach Hayayin&quot; (wine libations) on the Temple Altar with the destruction of the Temple.

Many kosher meat restaurants alter their menus during The Nine Days, replacing meat and chicken dishes with fish and vegetarian options in order to remain open while the meat prohibition is in place.

Children, pregnant or nursing women, and old or sick people who must eat meat for health reasons are allowed to do so. It is advisable, however, for them to eat poultry or meat derivatives.

One who usually makes &quot;Havdalah&quot; over wine or grape juice at the conclusion of Shabbat may do so during the Nine Days. According to many opinions, it is preferable to have a child under the age of Bar Mitzvah/Bat Mitzvah drink the wine or grape juice.
===Children===
Children under the age of Bar and Bat Mitzvah are generally included in the lighter mourning practices as training for mitzvah-observance. Thus, they will also refrain from listening to music or getting haircuts during the entire Three Weeks. However, young children are allowed to wear freshly washed clothes, and parents are allowed to launder those clothes for their children during the Nine Days. 

The Nine Days typically coincide with summer camps for Jewish children in America. While swimming and water sports are avoided, camps often run special study programs and Holocaust education modules. On Tisha B&#x27;Av itself, campers gather to listen to the traditional reading of the Book of Lamentations and engage in creative projects that express the themes of the day.

===Exceptions===
On Shabbat, all forms of mourning are suspended. Therefore, observant Jews eat meat at their Shabbat meals and drink wine or grape juice for Kiddush as usual. Similarly, while during the rest of the week one cannot wear freshly laundered clothes, on Shabbat, this is allowed.

Throughout the Nine Days (excluding Tisha B&#x27;Av), guests at a &quot;seudat mitzvah&quot;—for example, a brit milah ceremony, a pidyon haben, a bar mitzvah &quot;seudah&quot; on the boy&#x27;s birthday, or a siyum—are allowed to eat meat and drink wine. Some yeshivas, kollels, and other study programs try to plan the completion of a volume of Talmud or Mishnah to coincide with the Nine Days so that a meat meal may be served.

The last Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, requested that a &quot;siyum&quot; of a Talmudic tractate should be held every day of The Nine Days. Chabad now broadcasts the completion of tractates on its website.

An exception to the prohibition against new construction is made in the case of a building constructed for a mitzvah. Thus, a synagogue, yeshiva or mikveh may be constructed or decorated during the Nine Days.

==Shabbat Chazon==

During each of the three Shabbats of the Three Weeks, a different Haftarah is read in the synagogue after the Torah reading. These are:
# &quot;Divrei Yirmiyahu&quot; (from the Book of Jeremiah 1.1-2.3) (In most years, this coincides with &quot;Pinechas&quot;. In leap years when the preceding Rosh Chodesh was a Thursday [or, in Israel, when the following Rosh Chodesh is a Monday], it coincides with &quot;Matot&quot;.)
# &quot;Shim`u D&#x27;var Hashem&quot; (from the Book of Jeremiah 2.4-28) (In the leap years stated above when &quot;Matot&quot; is the first week, this coincides with &quot;Masei&quot;. In most years when &quot;Pinechas&quot; is the first week, &quot;Matot&quot; and &quot;Masei&quot; are read together for the second week.)
# &quot;Chazon Yishayahu&quot; (from the Book of Isaiah 1.1-27) (In all years, this coincides with &quot;Devarim&quot;.)
The last Shabbat preceding Tisha B&#x27;Av is traditionally called Shabbat Chazon (&quot;Sabbath [of the] Vision&quot;), after the first words of the Haftarah read on this day. According to Biblical tradition, the prophet Isaiah prophesied about the looming destruction of the first Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and the subsequent punishment that God would mete out to the Jewish people, mainly their exiles in the Jewish diaspora.

==Eighth of Av==

The eighth day of Av is called &quot;Erev Tisha B&#x27;Av&quot; (the eve of the Ninth of Av). It is customary to eat a large meal early in the afternoon before Mincha services, and then to have the &quot;Seudah HaMafseket&quot; (&quot;cut-off meal&quot;) right before sunset.

The &quot;Seudah HaMafseket&quot; resembles the meal of a mourner. The custom is to eat cold, hard-boiled eggs or lentils with bread and water. Only one cooked food may be eaten. The bread is dipped in ashes. Those who are eating sit on the ground or on low chairs, as they will during the night and morning of Tisha B&#x27;Av, and do not converse with each other.

If the Eighth of Av falls on a Shabbat or Friday, the &quot;Seudah HaMafseket&quot; is not eaten.

==Ninth of Av==
The ninth day of Av, or Tisha B&#x27;Av, is a fast day of extreme sadness and mourning over the destruction of the Temple. Some of the observances of this day resemble those of shiva, such as sitting on a low chair and not greeting people, while other observances reflect the theme of loss: the removal of the curtain from the ark, the lowered lighting in the synagogue, and the recital of &quot;Kinnot&quot; (elegies over the persecutions of Jewish communities throughout history). After midday, one may sit on a regular chair, but all the other restrictions of Tisha B&#x27;Av and the Nine Days continue to apply.

== End of restrictions ==

The restrictions of The Nine Days conclude at midday of the Tenth of Av, the day after Tisha B&#x27;Av. The Sages enforced this extension of the mourning period to reflect the fact that while the Temple was set on fire during the afternoon of Tisha B&#x27;Av, it continued to burn through the Tenth of Av. All the prohibitions associated with The Nine Days are still in effect until midday, although one who attends a &quot;seudat mitzvah&quot; at this time may consume meat and wine.

When Tisha B&#x27;Av falls on a Shabbat, the fast day is postponed until Sunday (the Tenth of Av). In this case, most restrictions end at nightfall after the fast. Except for the drinking of Havdalah wine, consumption of meat and wine are delayed until the following morning. Some opinions say that one should not listen to music until the next morning.

==Shabbat Nachamu==

The Shabbat after Tisha B&#x27;Av is called Shabbat Nachamu (&quot;Sabbath of Comforting&quot;), after the Haftarah read on this day from the Book of Isaiah 40:1-26, which speaks of &quot;comforting&quot; the Jewish people for their suffering. This is the first of the seven Haftarahs of consolation that express the theme of redemption, leading up to the holiday of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

<doc id="829445" wikidata="Q2624670" url="?curid=829445" title="Propiska in the Soviet Union">
<text>A propiska (, plural: &quot;propiski&quot;) was both a written residency permit and a migration-recording tool, used in the Russian Empire before 1917 and in the Soviet Union from 1932 until 1991.

The USSR had both permanent ( or ) and temporary () propiskas. In the transition period to a market economy in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union in late 1991, the &quot;permanent propiska&quot; in municipal apartments was a factor that allowed dwellers to obtain private-property rights on the living space they were &quot;inscripted&quot; in during privatization (those who built housing at their own expense obtained a &quot;permanent propiska&quot; there by definition).

==Etymology==

Originally, the noun &quot;propiska&quot; meant the clerical procedure of &quot;registration&quot;, of enrolling the person (writing his or her name) into the police records of the local population (or writing down the police permission into the person&#x27;s identification document - see below). Dahl&#x27;s Explanatory Dictionary describes this procedure as &quot;to enroll [the document] in a book and stamp it&quot;. Page 20 of the internal passport of the Russian Empire (see illustration) was entitled . Five blank pages (20 to 24) were gradually filled with stamps with the residential address written in. It allowed a person to reside in his/her relevant locality. Article 61 of the Regulations adopted on February 7, 1897 (see pp. 18–19 of the passport) imposed a fine for those found outside the administrative unit (as a rule, uezd) in which they were registered to live.

As a clerical term, the noun () is short for (&quot;vid na žítel&#x27;stvo&quot;). Although translated into English as a &quot;residential &quot;permit&quot;&quot;, in Russian, this combination of words also conveys a presence of the right of a resident to live somewhere. In the sense of a &quot;[legal] right&quot; the word also appears in the phrase (, ). Among many explanations of , Dahl&#x27;s Explanatory Dictionary indicates a &quot;certificate of any kind for free passage, travel and living&quot;, mentioning &quot;passport&quot; as its synonym. The verb () was used as a transitive verb with &quot;вид&quot; being the direct object. Not only the passport, but also its owner could serve as the verb&#x27;s direct object. Reciprocally, &quot;прописка&quot; became an object which one can &quot;have&quot;, e.g.: &quot;to have a propiska in Moscow&quot; (). In common speech, the stamp in the passport into which the residential address was written was also called &quot;propiska&quot;.

==History==
===Russian Empire===
The origin of the &quot;propiska&quot; dates back to the Russian Empire, more specifically Peter the Great who wanted to ensure &quot;that serfs stayed in the fields where they belonged.&quot;
 In the pre-Soviet Russian Empire, a person arriving for a new residency was obliged (depending on the estate) to enroll in the registers of the local police authorities. The latter could deny undesirable persons the right to settle (in this case, no stamps were made in passports). In most cases, this would mean the person had to return to their permanent domicile.

===Soviet Union===
Passports were abolished after the October Revolution and the free movement of people through the country was established. The 1930 edition of the Small Soviet Encyclopedia even described passports as a tool of control used by the former Tsarist police state. However, in December 1932, the Central Executive Committee and Sovnarkom (then under the leadership of Joseph Stalin) issued a decree that re-established a unified internal passport. The noun &quot;propiska&quot; became associated with the result of residential registration. &quot;Permanent propiska&quot; () confirmed the housing rights of its owner. &quot;Temporary propiska&quot; () could be provided alongside a permanent one when a resident had to live outside the permanent residence for a long period of time. As an example, students and workers leaving to study or work in other cities received &quot;temporary propiskas&quot; at their dorms, apartments, or hostels.

The decision to restrict internal migration was made against the backdrop of the massive social flux that originated from Stalin&#x27;s far-reaching collectivization and industrialization efforts. Millions of people circulated through the country, for example to receive training or take on new jobs, but also to flee the threat of being repressed as a supposed kulak. In this explosive context, the regime hoped that the &quot;propiska&quot; system (and other mechanisms such as &quot;labour books&quot; that monitored work ethic) would restore a degree of order. Even more importantly, the government aimed to stop the peasants from massively flooding to the towns in search of food as a result of the 1930-1933 famine. R. W. Davies and Stephen G. Wheatcroft note that the &quot;propiska&quot; was effective in this regard: &quot;The growth of the urban population ceased, and was partly reversed, only as a result of restrictions on movement and the introduction of an internal passport system.&quot;

The newly reintroduced Soviet passport system was similar to that of the Russian Empire where passports were required mainly in the largest cities and in the territories adjacent to the country&#x27;s external borders. Officers and soldiers always had special identity documents, while peasants could obtain internal passports only by a special application. In the USSR, the term &quot;residential permit&quot; () was used as a synonym for &quot;temporary propiska&quot;, particularly with regard to foreign nationals. By the end of the 1980s, when emigrants from the USSR could return, those who had lost Soviet citizenship could also apply for an identity document with this title. The &quot;passportization&quot; of the citizen of the USSR reached its all-encompassing scope only in the 1970s: the right (and obligation) of every adult (from 16) to have a passport promoted the propiska as the primary lever of the regulation of migration. On the other hand, the propiska underlined the mechanism of the constitutional obligation of the state to provide everyone a dwelling: no one could be stripped of the propiska at one location without substitution with another &quot;permanent propiska&quot; location, even amidst the then-rarely-granted right to emigrate.

The &quot;propiska&quot; system persisted throughout most of the Soviet era. In 1990, the Gorbachev government started an investigation into illegalities in the governance system through a special &quot;Committee of Constitutional Supervision&quot;. This committee found the &quot;propiska&quot; requirement to be illegal. Subsequently, the system was officially abolished on October 11, 1991.

==Implementation==
===The limit system for migrant workers===
The system of a propiska limit () existed in the last 30 or so years of the USSR. This was the only means by which outsiders could settle in big cities like Moscow and Leningrad, except marriage. Often enterprises in large cities built hostels with dormitories at their own expense, to provide accommodation (with temporary &quot;propiska&quot;) for migrant workers from elsewhere. After long-term employment at an enterprise, a worker could be given an apartment (as opposed to an individual hostel room, which often shared a single bathroom and kitchen per floor and was ill-suited for family life), with permanent &quot;propiska&quot; rights to it.

Cities themselves had a propiska limit for the low-wage city employers, such as street sweeps or janitors, because city natives shun from such occupations.

The native populations of large cities like Moscow often despised these migrant workers (&#x27;limit-dwellers&#x27; ), considering them rude, uncultured, and violent. The derogatory term &quot;limita&quot; () was used to refer to them.

Students from rural areas or smaller towns lived in similar students&#x27; hostels, with the termination of right of abode in the hostel on graduation or on exclusion from their schools.

===Details of propiska===
The &quot;propiska&quot; was recorded both in the internal passport of a Soviet citizen and at local governmental offices. In cities it was a local office of a utility organisation, such as РЭУ (District Production Department), ЖЭК (Housing Committee Office), or ЖСК (Housing and Construction Cooperative). The passports were stamped at the local police precinct&#x27;s Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) office, with the Military Comissariat (the draft body) also involved. In rural areas, it was a selsoviet, or &quot;village council&quot;, a governing body of a rural territory. A propiska could be permanent or temporary. The administrations of hostels, student dormitories, and landlords (very rare case in the USSR, since the &quot;sanitary norm&quot; (a minimum of per person, see below for further details) would usually cause rejection of temporary propiska for such a person) were obliged to maintain temporary propiska records of their guests. The &quot;propiska&quot; played the role of both residence permit and resident registration of a person.

Acquiring a propiska to move to a large city, especially Moscow, was extremely difficult for migrants and was a matter of prestige. Even moving to live with relatives did not automatically provide a person with a permanent propiska because of a minimum area limit () for each resident of a specific apartment.

Owing to Soviet property regulations (officially based on the Universal Right to Housing for all), the permanent propiska (which provided the permanent right to dwell in this housing) was nearly impossible for authorities to terminate. The only major exception was a second criminal sentence (after serving the penalty for the first sentence, the inmate returned to the old permanent propiska). If the authorities needed to rule in a certain case, they might refuse a permanent propiska for an individual, but usually not revoking the existing permanent propiska. This also resulted in a situation in which if a spouse agreed (at marriage) to provide the marriage partner with permanent propiska at their apartment, the propiska could not be terminated by divorce, and so exchanging the apartment for two smaller ones was often the only possibility.

===Sanitary norm===

Spouses could always provide one another a permanent propiska, but explicit consent was required for this. Children were granted a permanent propiska at one of the parents&#x27; permanent propiska locations, and this could not be terminated during the lifetime of the child even as an adult (with the exception of a second criminal sentence), unless the grown-up child voluntarily relocated to another place (and was granted a permanent propiska there).

It was not this easy for any other relatives. For such cases, as also for any unrelated people, the so-called &quot;sanitary norm&quot; was used: a propiska would not be issued if it would cause the apartment area to fall below per person. Also, the number of rooms in the apartment was important: two persons of different gender, one or both being 9 years or older, were forbidden to share a single room. If the new &quot;propiska&quot; of the new dweller violated this rule, the propiska would not be granted (spouses being an exception). This was officially meant to prevent unhealthy overcrowding of apartments and sexual abuse, but since most Soviet people had only a little over per person, it was also an effective method of migration control.

These norms were very similar to getting onto the governmental (not dependent on particular employer) &quot;housing list&quot;, which was yet another Soviet form of mortgage (again with real money replaced by years of working at one&#x27;s workplace—the queue was free in terms of money). The main difference was that to gain admission to the housing list the space had to fall below the required per person in an existing apartment (and, due to the dwelling-area rule already mentioned, children of different gender also raised the chances of getting to the queue). This housing list was very slow (much slower than employers&#x27; list), and sometimes it took a person&#x27;s whole life to get an apartment.

As a result, practically the only way for a person legally to improve their living conditions was marriage or childbirth. This was also a serious driving force in migration of young people to &quot;monocities&quot;, the new cities built from scratch, often in Siberia or the Arctic, some around a single facility (factory, oil region, or the like).

===Housing property rights and mortgage: pre/post Soviet===
In 1993, after the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, propiska was restructured as resident registration, so the modern Russian legislation does not use the terms &quot;propiska&quot; and &quot;propisat&quot; (with the exception of situations where a reference is needed for the Soviet period). However, it is still used as a colloquial abbreviation for &quot;permanent residency registration&quot;.

In the USSR, there had been some so-called &quot;cooperative&quot; apartments, owned on a Western-style mortgage basis, but they were scarce and getting one was very difficult. The three major post-Soviet reforms, to &quot;not show ethnic background&quot; on this still-vital document, private ownership (something previously disallowed), and seemingly free movement, being &quot;able to register to live anywhere, once they arrange a written lease or buy a house&quot; also ended the situation where these were the only apartments which passed down to children by inheritance. In normal apartments, when the last dweller died, the apartment was returned to the government: when the grandparents became older, they usually preferred to live separately from their children and grandchildren. This was usually connected to cheating of the propiska system: the grandparents were registered not for the apartment in which they lived but the apartment of their children, to avoid the return of their apartment to the government after their death.

Violations of the &quot;propiska&quot; system within a single city/town were rarely actually punished. Also, Moscow employers were allowed to employ people from the vicinity of Moscow living in a given radius (around ) from Moscow. In theory, it was possible to exchange apartments over mutual agreement between parties. Few people wanted to move from a large city to a smaller one, even with additional money, but the exchange of two flats for one in a larger city was sometimes possible. Also, apartment exchange with money involved was something of a &quot;gray area&quot; bordering on a criminal offence, and there was a real possibility that the participants would be prosecuted as for an economic crime, and real estate agents arranging such things were strictly outlawed and prosecuted, living in a &quot;gray area&quot; and hiding their activities from the authorities.

Many people used subterfuge to get a Moscow &quot;propiska&quot;, including marriages of convenience and bribery. Another way of obtaining Moscow residency was to become a &quot;limitchik&quot;: to enter Moscow to take certain understaffed job positions, such as at cleaning services, according to a certain workforce quota (&quot;limit&quot;). Such people were provided with a permanent living place (usually a flat or a room in a shared flat) for free, in exchange for working for a certain number of years. Some valuable specialists, such as scientists or engineers, could also be invited by enterprises, which provided them with flats at the expense of the enterprise.

At a certain period, residents of rural areas had their passports stored at selsoviets (officially &quot;for safekeeping&quot;) which prevented them from unofficial migration to the areas where they did not have apartments. This was intended to prevent cities from having an influx of migrants who sought higher living standards in large cities but had permanent registration far away from their actual place of residence.

===Propiska fee in Moscow===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, just before the collapse of the USSR, the authorities in Moscow introduced an official charge to be permanently registered in Moscow even in their own property. The fee was around US$5,000, around a quarter of the price of a small apartment at that time. This system lasted several years, causing major public uproar from human rights activists and other liberals, and was abolished after several rulings of the Russian Constitutional Court, the last one in late 1997.

===Propiska and education===
Students not of the city in question were provided a temporary propiska in the dormitories of their university campuses (generally, dormitory space was not provided to students studying in the same city as their parents&#x27; residence, but they often wanted it to be free from their parents). After graduation or leaving school early (expulsion, withdrawal, etc.), this temporary propiska was terminated.

In Soviet times, this was connected to a &quot;distribution&quot; system which was a mandatory official allocation of a first job placement for university graduates (even from the same city), where they had to work for around 2 years &quot;to pay back the cost of their education&quot;. Only postgraduates were exempted from this requirement.

This system was despised as being a violation of freedom, since nobody wanted to relocate from a larger city to a smaller one, but it still provided at least a propiska (and the dwelling space connected to it) to a graduate. Also, a &quot;young specialist&quot; could nearly never be fired, the same as a pregnant woman and other specific (in terms of labor laws) categories of people who were entitled to such benefits.

After the end of the USSR, the distribution system was almost immediately abolished, leaving graduates with the choice of returning to their home town/village, to their parents or other relatives or struggling to find work in the large city where the school was located. To do the latter, some people became &quot;propiska hunters&quot;, i.e. people marrying anybody with permanent propiska in a large city, just to retain their legal right to stay there after graduation. Since, once provided the permanent propiska was not revocable, the natives of the large city were very suspicious about senior-age students from smaller towns or villages when it came to marriage.

== Modern usage ==
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the &quot;propiska&quot; system was officially abolished. Several former Soviet republics, such as Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia, chose to keep their &quot;propiska&quot; systems, or at least a scaled-down version of them.

The Supreme Court of Russia has ruled the &quot;propiska&quot; to be unconstitutional on several occasions since the fall of communism and it is considered by human rights organizations to be in direct violation of the Russian constitution, which guarantees freedom of movement. Russia changed &quot;propiska&quot; to &quot;registration&quot;, though the word &quot;propiska&quot; is still widely used to refer to it colloquially. Citizens must register if they live in the same place for 90 days (Belarusian citizens in Russia and vice versa, 30 days). There are two types of registration, permanent and temporary. A place of permanent registration is indicated on a stamp made in an internal passport, and a place of temporary registration is written on a separate paper. Living in a dwelling without a permanent or temporary registration is considered an administrative offence.

Registration is used for economic, law enforcement and other purposes, such as accounting for social benefits, housing and utility payments, taxes, conscription, and medical care.

Today, registration plays little role in questions of property. In Soviet times, for example, if after a marriage, a wife was registered in accommodation her husband rented from the state, in case of divorce, she could obtain some part of her husband&#x27;s place of residence for her own usage. In modern Russia, this was mostly abandoned due to apartment privatisation, but if a person has no other place to live, he still cannot be evicted without substitution, acting as a powerful deterrent for registering others on their property title.

At the same time, many documents and rights may be obtained only at the place where a citizen has permanent registration, which causes problems, for example, with obtaining or changing passports, voting, obtaining inquiry papers, which are often needed in Russia. Unfortunately, officials tend to ignore laws that allow people to obtain such things and rights if they exist.

For foreigners, registration is called &quot;migration control&quot; and is stamped on a migration card and/or coupon, approximately one third the size of an A4 paper, which must be returned to officials before departure.

Migration control is much stricter than internal registration. For instance, to employ any Russian citizen, even with the permanent registration out of the city in question, the employer needs no special permit; only the employee must be registered.

Employing unregistered people is an administrative offence for the employer, but penalties are rare: sometimes even Western companies in Moscow employ unregistered people (usually university graduates who have lost their dormitory registration due to graduation). The penalty is much stricter in the case of foreigners. To employ foreigners, employers must have a permit from the Federal Migration Service.

Belarusian citizens have the same employment rights as Russian citizens in Russia.

In 2001, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine ruled that &quot;propiska&quot; was unconstitutional. In 2003, the registration of the place of residence was introduced instead.

In Uzbekistan, even though citizens are issued a single passport, severe restrictions on movement within the country apply, particularly in the capital Tashkent. After the 1999 Tashkent bombings, the former Soviet era restrictions were reimposed, making it virtually impossible to acquire propiska in Tashkent.

<text>The Three Weeks or Bein ha-Metzarim (, &quot;Between the &quot;, cf &quot;&quot;) is a period of mourning commemorating the destruction of the first and second Jewish Temples. The Three Weeks start on the seventeenth day of the Jewish month of Tammuz—the fast of the Seventeenth of Tammuz—and end on the ninth day of the Jewish month of Av—the fast of Tisha B&#x27;Av, which occurs exactly three weeks later. Both of these fasts commemorate events surrounding the destruction of the Jewish Temples and the subsequent exile of the Jews from the land of Israel. According to conventional chronology, the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II occurred in 586/7 BCE, and the second siege of Jerusalem (70) by the Romans, in 70 CE. Jewish chronology, however, traditionally places the first destruction at about 421 BCE: see Missing years (Jewish calendar) for more information.

==Observances==
The mourning observances during the Three Weeks are divided into four levels, increasing in intensity:
#From 17 Tammuz until the end of the month
#From Rosh Chodesh Av until the week in which Tisha B&#x27;Av falls
#The week in which Tisha B&#x27;Av falls until the Eighth of Av
#Tisha B&#x27;Av itself

Standard Ashkenazic custom, or minhag, restricts the extent to which one may take a haircut, shave or listen to music with instruments. However, communities and individuals vary their levels of observance of these customs. No Jewish marriages or other major celebrations are allowed during the Three Weeks, since the joy of such an event would conflict with the expected mourning mood during this time.

Many Orthodox Jews refrain from eating meat during the Nine Days from the first of the month of Av until midday of the day after the fast of Tisha B&#x27;Av, based on the tradition that the Temple burned until that time.

===Time of danger===
The Three Weeks are considered historically a time of misfortune since many tragedies and calamities which befell the Jewish people are attributed to this period. These tragedies include the breaking of the Tablets of the Law by Moses, when he saw the people worshipping the golden calf; the burning of a Torah scroll by Apostomus during the Second Temple period; the destruction of both Temples on Tisha B&#x27;Av; the expulsion of the Jews from Spain shortly before Tisha B&#x27;Av 1492; and the outbreak of World War I shortly before Tisha B&#x27;Av 1914, which overturned many Jewish communities.

As a result, some Jews are particularly careful to avoid all dangerous situations during the Three Weeks. These include: going to dangerous places, undergoing a major operation that could be postponed until after Tisha B&#x27;Av, going on an airplane flight that could be postponed until after Tisha B&#x27;Av, and engaging in a court case if it can be postponed until after Tisha B&#x27;Av.

==History==
The first source for a special status of the Three Weeks—which is also the oldest extant reference to these days as Bein ha-Metzarim—is found in Lamentations Rabbah 1:29 (4th century?). This midrash glosses Lamentations 1:3 (&quot;All [Zion&#x27;s] pursuers overtook her between the straits&quot;), interpreting &quot;straits&quot; as &quot;days of distress&quot;—namely the Seventeenth of Tammuz and the Ninth of Av. Isaac Tyrnau (late 14th-early 15th centuries) wrote in his book &quot;Minhagim,&quot; a record of Austrian customs, that haircuts are not taken and weddings are not celebrated during the Three Weeks. His opinion was cited as halacha by Moses Isserles in Rema on &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, which is the foundation for most of current Ashkenazic practice.

==Special haftarot==
Special haftarot (passages from the Nevi&#x27;im), the &quot;Three of Affliction&quot; (&quot;tlat de-purʿanuta&quot;), are read in the synagogue on each Shabbat of the three weeks. These prophecies of Jeremiah and Isaiah predict the fall of Jerusalem, unlike most haftarot of the yearly cycle, which reflect the theme of the day&#x27;s Torah reading. 

The &quot;Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana&quot; is the first source to designate the appropriate 12 selections from the Prophets, the Three of Affliction being 
#&quot;Divre Yirmeyahu&quot;, &quot;Words of Jeremiah&quot; (Jeremiah 1.1-2.3),
#&quot;Shim`u Devar Hashem&quot; &quot;Hear the word of the LORD&quot; (Jeremiah 2.4-28), and
#&quot;Hazon Yisha`yahu&quot; &quot;Vision of Isaiah&quot; (Isaiah 1.1-27).

Most congregations use the haftarot suggested by the &quot;Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana&quot;, which are not mentioned in the Talmud. But Maimonides in his &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; prescribes a slight variation of these three, and Yemenite Jews read the haftarot that he lists.
The nine haftarot of the eight weeks following Tisha B&#x27;Av likewise were selected for their content. These are the &quot;Seven of Consolation&quot; (&quot;shev di-nhemta&quot;) followed by the &quot;Two of Repentance&quot; (&quot;tarte di-tyuvta&quot;)—which two appropriately fall between Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur; one is read on Saturday like the other special haftarot, but the other is read on the Fast of Gedaliah.

==The Nine Days==

According to the Mishnah, &quot;from the beginning of Av, happiness is decreased.&quot; The last nine days of the three weeks—which are also the first nine days of the month of Av, culminating in the Tisha B&#x27;Av fast—constitute therefore a period of intensified mourning in the Ashkenazi custom. Many Jewish communities refrain from partaking of poultry, red meat, and wine; wearing freshly laundered clothes; and bathing in warm water. Sephardic Jews observe many of these restrictions only from the Sunday before Tisha B&#x27;Av, dispensing with them entirely in years when Tisha B&#x27;Av falls on a Sunday. Yemenite Jews do not maintain these customs.

<doc id="829498" wikidata="Q207107" url="?curid=829498" title="Sulphur-crested cockatoo">
<text>The sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) is a relatively large white cockatoo found in wooded habitats in Australia, New Guinea, and some of the islands of Indonesia. They can be locally very numerous, leading to them sometimes being considered pests. A highly intelligent bird, they are well known in aviculture, although they can be demanding pets.

==Distribution==
In Australia, sulphur-crested cockatoos can be found widely in the north and east, ranging from the Kimberley to as far south as Tasmania, but avoiding arid inland areas with few trees. They are numerous in suburban habitats in cities such as Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. Except for highland areas, they occur throughout most of New Guinea and on nearby smaller islands such as Waigeo, Misool and Aru, and various islands in the Cenderawasih Bay and Milne Bay.
There are four recognised subspecies:
A 2024 genetic study found that the Triton cockatoo is genetically distinct from the two Australian forms of sulphur-crested cockatoo and should therefore be considered a separate species, &quot;Cacatua triton&quot;.

===Introduced species===
Within Australia, sulphur-crested cockatoos of the nominate race have also been introduced to Perth, which is far outside the natural range. Outside Australia, they have been introduced to Singapore, where their numbers have been estimated to be between 500 and 2000. They have also been introduced to Palau and New Zealand. In New Zealand, the introduced populations may number less than 1000. This species has also been recorded as established in Hawaii and from various islands in Wallacea (e.g. Kai Islands and Ambon), but it is unclear if it has managed to become established there.

==Description==
Sulphur-crested cockatoos are long, with the Australian subspecies larger than subspecies from New Guinea and nearby islands. The plumage is overall white, while the underwing and -tail are tinged yellow. The expressive crest is yellow. The bill is black, the legs are grey, and the eye-ring is whitish. Males typically have almost black eyes, whereas the females have a more red or brown eye, but this requires optimum viewing conditions to be seen. The differences between the subspecies are subtle. &quot;C. g. fitzroyi&quot; is similar to the nominate race but lacks the yellow on the ear tufts and has slightly blueish skin around the eye. &quot;C. g. eleonora&quot; is similar to &quot;C. g. fitzroyi&quot; but is smaller and has broader feathers in the crest, and &quot;C. g. triton&quot; is similar to &quot;C. g. eleonora&quot; except it has a smaller bill.

It is similar in appearance to the three species of corellas found in Australia. However, corellas are smaller, lack the prominent yellow crest and have pale bills. In captivity, the sulphur-crested cockatoo is easily confused with the smaller yellow-crested cockatoo or the blue-eyed cockatoo with a differently shaped crest and a darker blue eye-ring.

==Behaviour==
Sulphur-crested cockatoos&#x27; distinctive raucous calls can be very loud, which is a result of an adaptation in order to travel through the forest environments in which they live, including tropical and subtropical rainforests. These birds are naturally curious, as well as very intelligent. They have adapted very well to European settlement in Australia and live in many urban areas.

Being intelligent, in Sydney, Australia, they have learned how to open garbage bins as a source of food. The behavior spreads among the birds by imitation. In captivity some will spontaneously dance to music with a variety of unique moves.

These birds are very long-lived, and can live upwards of 70 years in captivity, although they only live to about 20–40 years in the wild. They have been known to engage in geophagy, the process of eating clay to detoxify their food. These birds produce a very fine powder to waterproof themselves instead of oil as many other birds do.

The sulphur-crested cockatoo is a seasonal breeder in Australia; little is known about its breeding behaviour in New Guinea. In southern Australia, the breeding season is from August to January, whereas in northern Australia the season is from May to September. The nest is a bed of wood chips in a hollow in a tree. Like many other parrots it competes with others of its species and with other species for nesting sites. Two to three eggs are laid and incubation lasts between 25–27 days. Both parents incubate the eggs and raise the nestlings. The nestling period is between 9 and 12 weeks, and the young fledglings remain with their parents for a number of months after fledging.

Sulphur-crested cockatoos have a range of visually observable expressions. A 2009 study involving an Eleonora cockatoo (the subspecies &quot;Cacatua galerita eleonora&quot;) named Snowball found that sulphur-crested cockatoos are capable of synchronizing movements to a musical beat. Sulphur-crested cockatoos use facial expressions (with their feathers) to indicate positive emotions.

Species that feed on the ground are very vulnerable to predator attack. The cockatoo has evolved a behavioural adaptation to protect against this: whenever there is a flock on the ground, there is at least one high up in a tree (usually a dead tree), keeping guard. This is so well known that it has even entered Australian slang: a person keeping guard for sudden police raids on illegal gambling gatherings is referred to as a &quot;cockatoo&quot; or &quot;cocky&quot; for short.

==Pest status==

In some parts of Australia, sulphur-crested cockatoos can be very numerous, and may cause damage to cereal and fruit crops and newly planted tree seedlings, as well as soft timber on houses and outdoor furniture. Consequently, they are sometimes shot or poisoned as pests. A government permit is required for any culling, because the birds are a protected species under the Australian Commonwealth Law.

Many have assumed that the human feeding of sulphur-crested cockatoos has caused many issues for the birds, including pest behaviour and disease in many localities. Numerous places around Australia like the Surf Coast in Victoria and the Blue Mountains in New South Wales have had residents complain and rules be constructed to forbid locals and visitors in towns and national parks from hand-feeding cockatoos.

==Aviculture==
Sulphur-crested cockatoos may no longer be imported into the United States as a result of the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA). However, they have been bred in captivity, with Eleonora and Triton cockatoos the most common subspecies seen in aviculture in the USA and Europe. They are socially demanding pets and have a natural desire to chew wood and other hard and organic materials. They are also loud, often unleashing loud squawks or piercing screeches. They may also make aggressive, unpredictable movements which can frighten people and animals unaware of the accompanying affection.

One cockatoo called Fred was still alive at 100 years of age in 2014. Cocky Bennett of Tom Ugly&#x27;s Point in Sydney was a celebrated sulphur-crested cockatoo who reached an age of 100 years or more. He had lost his feathers and was naked for much of his life, and died in the early years of the twentieth century. His body was stuffed and preserved after death. Another &#x27;cocky&#x27;, born in 1921 and residing in Arncliffe with his owner Charlie Knighton, was 76 years old in the late 1990s. Their longevity can cause a problem of being a beloved pet and bonding to an adult who then, as they age together, dies while the bird is in their prime but has lost their life partner. The deceased owner&#x27;s children are often faced with the problem of how to rehome the bird. RSPCA in Canberra regularly form large flocks of these birds which are then rehabilitated to the wild as a family unit .

Sulphur-crested cockatoos, along with many other parrots, are susceptible to psittacine beak and feather disease, a viral disease, which causes birds to lose their feathers and grow grotesquely shaped beaks. The disease occurs naturally in the wild, and in captivity.

<text>The Kenya African Union (KAU) was a political organization in colonial Kenya, formed in October 1944 prior to the appointment of the first African to sit in the Legislative Council. In 1960 it became the current Kenya African National Union (KANU).

==Formation==
KAU was formed on October 1, 1944, with the veteran political leader Harry Thuku as its president. Francis Joseph Khamisi became its secretary while Albert Owino became its Treasurer. It had a Representative Committee of seven which included John K. Kebaso (South Nyanza), James Samuel Gichuru (Central), Jimmy Jeremiah (Coast), Simeon Mulandi (Ukambani), Harry L. Nangurai (Maasai) and S.B. Jakeyo (Central Nyanza).
Nine days later, on October 10, 1944, Governor Sir Philip Mitchell appointed Eliud Mathu to become the first African to sit in the Kenya Legislative Council. This appointment marked an important turning point in the political development of the Africans. 
The following month in November 1944, at the insistence of the Governor, the name ‘Study’ was added to the name becoming the Kenya African Study Union. The Governor stated that the name ‘Study’ was meant to make it a “colony-wide African body to provide an organization where the views of the educated African elite could be given a forum.”
The organization was meant to ‘study’ the problems or grievances of the Africans and accordingly advise Eliud Mathu at the Legislative Council. To change the name to Kenya African Union, Mathu called for a meeting in Harry Thuku’s shop in Nairobi, and in attendance was Gichuru, Joseph D. Otiende, Jonathan Njoroge, Henry Mwaniki, Francis Khamisi, Kamau Njoroge, Albert Awino, Ambrose Ofafa, Mucohi Gikonyo and Simeon Mulandi.

==KAU’s objectives==
At inception, the party’s objectives included advancing African interests, constitutional reforms, and fighting for better living and working conditions for Africans. KAU also helped coordinate nationalist activities and to unite Kenyan Africans towards a common cause. Initially, KAU enjoyed cordial relations with the Colonial administration but then the relationship quickly turned sour, particularly with the exit of Harry Thuku who was considered a moderate. The colonial administration also created a hostile environment which made the attainment of KAU’s objectives difficult. Soon, ideological differences in its ranks, particularly among the moderates and the radicals, threatened to tear apart the fabric that held it together. The lack of political awareness among the Africans coupled with widespread ethnic distrust among the Africans also slowed down the new party. They also lacked adequate funds for operations and for a long time did not have a fixed address.

==Gichuru takes over==
In January 1945, Thuku resigned, and at the first Delegates Conference held on February 3, 1945, his place was taken over by James Gichuru, a Makerere-trained teacher who had resigned from his teaching position at Alliance High School. Thuku was considered a bit of a moderate taking this position after returning from his decade-long detention for political agitation. James Gichuru quickly reorganized the party and expanded the Delegates. He launched a newspaper “Sauti ya Mwafrika” (Voice of the African) which was edited by Francis Khamisi. The paper articulated the grievances of the Africans. In the next Delegates Conference in February 1946, the name ‘Study’ was dropped and the party reverted to its old name KAU. At this point, KAU was considered by many to be a reincarnation of the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA) which had been banned in 1939.
In fact, one of the Committee members Simeon Mulandi, had been the leader of the Ukamba Member’s Union which had been banned alongside the KCA.
Under Gichuru, the party took a more nationalistic path. During the Second Delegates Conference, Joseph D. Otiende from North Nyanza (now Western Kenya), was elected vice president of the party, giving the party a more national outlook. Like Gichuru, Otiende had studied at Makerere and had also taught at Alliance High School. They had joined Makerere in the same year (1933) and had also been students at Alliance High School before that.
The KAU demanded an end to the ‘Kipande system’, the identification system much loathed by the Africans. Eliud Mathu successfully had it repealed in what was one of the major triumphs by the Africans. Other demands by the KAU included the abolition of taxes designed only for Africans, the return of alienated land, equal pay for equal work, and increased African representation at the Legislative Council. 

==KAU&#x27;s achievements==
In January 1946, Governor Mitchell appointed Fanwell Walter Odede to sit at the Legislative Council to replace Rev. Leonard J. Beecher in an acting capacity. Odede remained at the Legislative Council until 1947 when Beecher decided to resign from the Legislative Council altogether. But rather than appoint Odede substantively, Governor Mitchell, decided to appoint Benaiah Apolo Ohanga to replace Beecher and revoked the appointment of Odede. And so officially, Ohanga became the second African to be appointed to the Legislative Council.

==Kenyatta takes over==
In September 1946, Jomo Kenyatta returned to Kenya and in June 1947, James Gichuru stepped down as President of KAU in favour of Jomo Kenyatta. After spending many years in England representing the grievances of the Africans, Kenyatta had captured the imagination of many Kenyans and had become a towering national figure. He was considered the natural leader in the quest for Independence and consequently steered the KAU towards a more nationalistic agenda with the attainment of independence in mind. 
In May 1948, Governor Mitchell appointed John Kipsugut araap Chemallan, a pioneer radio broadcaster to the Legislative Council to represent the Northern and Rift Valley Provinces and the Maasai. Eliud Mathu was now designated as the representative for Central Province. Ohanga now represented Nyanza while James Jeremiah represented the Coast. They were formally nominated as unofficial members of the Legislative Council to represent ‘the interests of the African Community’.
Under Jomo Kenyatta, the KAU moved a notch higher demanding the abolition of taxation, free and compulsory education for Africans, expanded representation at the Legislative Council, better pay and better working conditions, return of alienated lands issuance of title deeds to Africans, respect of African culture, compensation of African ex-soldiers, an end of racial discrimination and release of political prisoners. The party began recruiting members nationwide.

==Demand for Independence==
On June 10, 1951, the KAU demanded an end to colonial rule and Independence within three years. In November 1951, KAU sent a deputation to the United Nations Conference in Paris where they presented a petition entitled “Land Hunger in Kenya” which called for an urgent solution to the Land question in Kenya with regard to the Africans.
The same year, radical members of the KAU in the Nairobi Branch formed a ‘Central Committee’ known as “Muhimu” (Kiswahili for ‘Important’) which began to plan more militant methods to achieve Independence. They began oathing members in a secret organization known as the Mau Mau. The “Muhimu” led by Eliud Mutonyi (Chairman), Isaac Gathanju (Secretary), Bildad Kaggia, Paul Ngei, and Fred Kubai as members, coordinated the Mau Mau activities and administration of oaths. The oathing began in Nairobi slums and soon morphed into active oathing in Kiambu, Fort Hall (presently Murang’a County), and Nyeri.

==KAU is banned==
Soon after his arrival to take up his governorship, Sir Evelyn Baring made a brief tour of Central Kenya to familiarize himself with the situation. He met headmen, chiefs, priests, settlers and other influential members of society, and soon concluded that there was an impending state of anarchy that would almost certainly become unmanageable in due course. He returned to Nairobi and on October 10, 1952, cabled the Secretary of State for the Colonies Oliver Lyttelton seeking permission to declare a state of Emergency in the colony.

Four days later, on October 14, 1952, Lyttelton in response stated, “I approve your proposal to declare a state of Emergency under Emergency Powers Order in Council, 1939, and to take action against Kenyatta and his henchmen. I shall give you my full support in thus maintaining law and order.”
Five days later, Governor Baring declared a state of Emergency in Kenya.
The following day on October 20, 1952, KAU leaders Jomo Kenyatta and several other leaders were arrested under the Operation Jock Scott. This followed the declaration of the Emergency by the new governor SirEvelyn Baring. 

In November 1952, a deputation of KAU leaders which included Walter Odede, Wycliffe W.W. Awori and Joseph Murumbi, tried to meet with Lyttelton who had come to oversee the operations against the Mau Mau. They wanted to discuss the unfolding situation with him. Through Governor Baring, they sought and were granted audience with Lyttelton at Government House. But when they arrived, Lyttelton refused to even greet them greatly embarrassing Governor Baring who had arranged the meeting.

Speaking to them separately, Baring asked them to disassociate themselves with Kenyatta and the arrested leaders of KAU. They tried but were unable to convince the Governor that the KAU did not have any Mau Mau adherents in its ranks, and tried to exonerate Kenyatta from any links with the Mau Mau.

During the meeting, The KAU deputation presented a petition to the Governor seeking a number of reforms including the abolition by law of racial discrimination, the extension of education facilities to Africans, elections for African members and increased African representation in the Legislative Council. They also demanded a common roll for all three races with equal seats for Africans and non-Africans. They also demanded commissioned ranks for Africans in the Armed Forces and senior civil service posts; assistance in agricultural development; equal pay for equal qualifications and work and freedom of speech and assembly.

The Emergency dealt a severe blow to the KAU and most of its leaders, particularly those from Central Kenya, were either arrested or had to flee to avoid arrest. Odede took over the leadership of KAU on an acting capacity but he too was arrested on March 8, 1953, again on suspicions of sympathizing with the Mau Mau.
KAU was eventually banned on June 8, 1953, eight months into the Emergency.
The ban coincided with the arrival of British troops to boost the effort against the Mau Mau. 
Prior to Odede&#x27;s arrest, the Luo Union under the Ker Oginga Odinga, issued a statement supporting KAU and this raised fears that the influence of the Mau Mau would spread to Nyanza. After Odede&#x27;s arrest, the other influential Nyanza leader Wycliffe Works Wasya Awori was constantly harassed even as he demanded the African MLCs be allowed to hold meetings as they wanted.

==KAU and the Mau Mau==
In his submissions to the Secretary of State for the Colonies seeking to declare a state of Emergency, Governor Baring argued that the KAU leaders, particularly Jomo Kenyatta, were at the back of Mau Mau and behind the violence. The Colonial administration was convinced beyond a doubt that the KAU was behind the Mau Mau movement. On numerous occasions, Jomo Kenyatta had in fact denounced the Mau Mau at a public meeting in February 1951 and also at a public rally at the Kirigiti Stadium in Kiambu on August 24, 1952. The meeting, which was attended by all the Kikuyu notables, had been called to specifically denounce the Mau Mau. One of those who addressed the meeting was Senior Chief Waruhiu Kungu. It was the death of Senior Chief Waruhiu Kungu on October 7, 1952, that convinced Governor Baring that something had to be done. Chief Waruhiu was gunned down at Gachie, some seven miles outside Nairobi while on his way home. His vehicle was blocked by another and a gunman emerged shooting him dead. The act was blamed on the Mau Mau and the declaration of Emergency followed shortly.
The British government sent in troops to bolster the war effort against the Mau Mau. General Sir George Erskine was appointed the Commander-in-Chief of the East African Command meant to deal with the Mau Mau decisively. 
Upon arrival, General Sir George Erskine addressed the Press saying:
“…there is no doubt that there are members of the Kenya African Union who have no connections with the violent movement. But the action has been taken because the government has satisfied itself that there is ample evidence to show that the Kenya African Union has been used as a cover by the Mau Mu terrorist organization and that both before and after the Emergency was declared, there has been a connection between many members of the Kenya African Union and the Mau Mau terrorists.”

“As an illustration of the connection of many KAU members with the violent Mau Mau movement, two of the most wanted terrorists in Kenya, Dedan Kimathi and Stanley Mathenge are both KAU members, Kimathi having been Secretary of the Rumuruti-Thompson’s Falls Branch and Mathenge a member of the Nyeri Branch. Mau Mau evolved out of the Kikuyu Central Association which was proscribed in 1939. Both societies relied on similar oath-taking ceremonies to initiate new members; both were subversive. Shortly after its inauguration in 1944, the KAU was penetrated by the influence of former Kikuyu Central Association and by 1947 became dominated by ex-KCA leaders and members”

During one of his radio addresses, acting Chief Native Commissioner Sir Edward H. Windley stated:

“The Kenya African Union is finished. It was like a bad house destroyed because it was infected with disease, and we cannot use the same bricks to build again. It is for all you sensible and reasonable Africans who believe in good government to get together and work for it in the interests of your people, and to think now how best we can achieve it in the future.”

==The formation of KANU==
On March 27, 1960, the African members of the Legislative Council who had coalesced around a loose political federation known as the Kenya Independence Movement (KIM), met at Kirigiti stadium in Kiambu to discuss the formation of a nationwide political party. Delegates from various political movements across the country were in attendance. Months earlier, in August 1959, eight of the 14 African elected members announced the formation of a moderate Kenya National Party (KNP). Headed by MLC for Nyanza North Masinde Muliro, the new party adopted multi-racialism and even integrated Europeans in its ranks among them S.V. Cooke the European MLC from Mombasa. They also attracted several Asians and Arabs. 
To counter this move, Tom Mboya and five other African MLCs announced the formation of an all-African Kenya Independence Movement (KIM), declaring that &#x27;African freedom will be achieved only through African nationalism.&#x27; During the March 1960 meeting at Kirigiti in Kiambu, a committee was formed to establish a prominent ‘Uhuru’ political party. That committee, chaired by James Gichuru and Dr. Njoroge Mungai as secretary, also had Oginga Odinga, Dr. Gikonyo Kiano and Tom Mboya among its members. They were tasked to draft the constitution for a new political party. They settled on the name KANU. 
On May 14, 1960, a second meeting at Kirigiti took place and the delegates ratified the formation of a new political party named the Kenya African National Union. They presented their registration documents to the Registrar of Societies David John Coward. They received the registration documents on June 11, 1960 with James Gichuru as president, Oginga Odinga as Vice President and Tom Mboya as Secretary General. They retained the old KAU flag complete with its colours and adopted the cockerel as its symbol. Indeed the old KAU had roared back to life. 

==Conclusion==
In many ways, the banning of the KAU in June 1953, did not quite extinguish its influence as a political party. Throughout the Emergency, African political activities were completely under check, but the Colonial administration was careful not to push the Africans too far. They instituted reforms meant to deal with the situation that had fomented the outbreak of the Mau Mau rebellion in the first place. Some of the recommendations of the KAU were implemented including the expansion of African representation in both the Legislative Council and the executive council. In 1954, KAU member Benaiah Ohanga was appointed to the executive council becoming the first African minister. More Africans were appointed to the Legislative Council. In March 1957, the Africans were able to choose their own representations through an election for 8 new seats created for the Africans. Further pressure from the Africans saw the seats expanded to 14 and a by-election was held in 1958 to increase the membership. 
Among its main achievements, the KAU helped united various communities in Kenya under the banner of national unity. The Luo and the Kikuyu seemed particularly close politically and they would eventually merge the different political ideologies into a more cogent national party named the Kenya African National Union (KANU). The new party, formed in 1960 under KAU’s erstwhile leader James Gichuru, eventually led to the attainment of self-rule in June 1963 after sweeping the polls against its more moderate rival the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU). Independence was achieved under the KANU government on December 12, 1964.

<text>Margaret Deland (born Margaretta Wade Campbell; February 23, 1857 – January 13, 1945) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet. She also wrote an autobiography in two volumes. She generally is considered part of the literary realism movement.

==Biography==

Margaretta Wade Campbell was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (today a part of Pittsburgh) on February 23, 1857. Her mother died due to complications from the birth, and she was left in the care of an aunt named Lois Wade and her husband Benjamin Campbell Blake.

On May 12, 1880, she married Lorin F. Deland. Her husband had inherited his father&#x27;s publishing company, which he sold in 1886 and worked in advertising. It was at this period she began to write, first writing verses for her husband&#x27;s greeting-card business. Her first poem was published in the March 1885 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; and her first poetry collection, titled &quot;The Old Garden and Other Verses&quot;, was published in late 1886 by Houghton Mifflin. Her novel &quot;John Ward, Preacher&quot;, her first, was published in 1888.

Deland and her husband moved to Boston, Massachusetts and, over a four-year span, they took in and supported unmarried mothers at their residence at 76 Mount Vernon Street on Beacon Hill. They also maintained the summer home Greywood, overlooking the Kennebunk River in Kennebunkport, Maine. It was in this home that Canadian actress Margaret Anglin visited in 1909, and the two women reviewed Deland&#x27;s manuscript for &quot;The Awakening of Helena Richie&quot;. Anglin reported &quot;I never spent a pleasanter time than I did while Mrs. Deland and I chugged up and down the little Kennbunkport River in a boat, talking over the future of &quot;Helena Richie&quot;.&quot; The Delands kept their summer home in Maine for about 50 years.

In 1910, Deland wrote an article for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, recognizing the ongoing struggles for women&#x27;s rights in the United States: &quot;Restlessness!&quot; she wrote, &quot;A prevailing discontent among women — a restlessness infinitely removed from the content of a generation ago.&quot; During World War I, Deland did relief work in France; she was awarded a cross from the Legion of Honor for her work. &quot;She received a Litt.D. from Bates College in 1920. In 1926, she was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters along with Edith Wharton, Agnes Repplier and Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman. The election of these four women to the organization was said to have &quot;marked the letting down of the bars to women.&quot; Deland was also a member of an informal women&#x27;s social club that met regularly and included Amy Beach, Alice Howe Gibbens (wife of William James), and Ida Agassiz (wife of Henry Lee Higginson).

By 1941, Deland had published 33 books. She died in Boston at the Hotel Sheraton, where she then lived, in 1945. She is buried at Forest Hills Cemetery. Her home on Mount Vernon Street is a stop on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

==Critical response==
Deland is known principally for the novel &quot;John Ward, Preacher&quot; (1888), an indictment of Calvinism, which became a best-seller. Her &#x27;Old Chester&#x27; books, based on her early memories of the Pittsburgh communities where she grew up — including Maple Grove and Manchester — were also popular. She was recognized as an important and popular author of literary realism in the United States, but some of her plots and themes were shocking to some. In her lifetime, she was called the American Mrs. Humphry Ward and was compared to Elizabeth Gaskell.

<text>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT; , also known as PhysTech), is a public research university located in Moscow Oblast, Russia. It prepares specialists in theoretical and applied physics, applied mathematics and related disciplines.

The main MIPT campus is located in Dolgoprudny, a northern suburb of Moscow. However the Aeromechanics Department is based in Zhukovsky, a suburb south-east of Moscow.

As Phystech&#x27;s founder, Pyotr Kapitsa, designed the institute inspired by and in accordance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology model, Phystech is commonly hailed as the &quot;MIT of Russia&quot; and is considered to be the leading specialized technical institution of higher education in the former Soviet Union.

Nikolay Kudryavtsev (Кудрявцев Николай Николаевич]), the president of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology has signed a letter of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The rector Dmitry Livanov did not sign it.

==History==

In late 1945 and early 1946, a group of Soviet scientists, including the future Nobel Prize winner Pyotr Kapitsa, lobbied the government for the creation of a higher educational institution radically different from the type established in the Soviet system of higher education. Applicants, selected by challenging examinations and personal interviews, would be taught by and work together with, prominent scientists. Each student would follow a personalized curriculum created to match his or her particular areas of interest and specialization. This system would later become known as the &quot;Phystech System&quot;.

In a letter to Stalin in February 1946, Kapitsa argued for the need for such a school, which he tentatively called the &quot;Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology&quot;, to better maintain and develop the country&#x27;s defense potential. The institute would follow the principles outlined above and was supposed to be governed by a board of directors of the leading research institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences. On March 10, 1946, the government issued a decree mandating the establishment of a &quot;College of Physics and Technology&quot; ().

For unknown reasons, the initial plan came to a halt in the summer of 1946. The exact circumstances are not documented, but the common assumption is that Kapitsa&#x27;s refusal to participate in the Soviet atomic bomb project and his disfavor with the government and communist party that followed, cast a shadow over an independent school based largely on his ideas. Instead, a new government decree was issued on November 25, 1946, establishing the new school as a Department of Physics and Technology within Moscow State University. November 25 is celebrated as the date of MIPT&#x27;s founding.

Kapitsa foresaw that within a traditional educational institution, the new school would encounter bureaucratic obstacles, but even though Kapitsa&#x27;s original plan to create the new school as an independent organization did not come to fruition exactly as envisioned, its most important principles survived intact. The new department enjoyed considerable autonomy within Moscow State University. Its facilities were in Dolgoprudny (the two buildings it occupied are still part of the present day campus), away from the MSU campus. It had its own independent admissions and education system, different from the one centrally mandated for all other universities. It was headed by the MSU &quot;vice rector for special issues&quot;—a position created specifically to shield the department from the university management.

As Kapitsa expected, the special status of the new school with its different &quot;rules of engagement&quot; caused much consternation and resistance within the university. The immediate cult status that Phystech gained among talented young people, drawn by the challenge and romanticism of working on the forefront of science and technology and on projects of &quot;government importance,&quot; many of them classified, made it an untouchable rival of every other school in the country, including MSU&#x27;s own Department of Physics. At the same time, the increasing disfavor of Kapitsa with the government (in 1950 he was essentially under house arrest) and anti-semitic repressions of the late 1940s made Phystech an easy target of intrigues and accusations of &quot;elitism&quot; and &quot;rootless cosmopolitanism.&quot; In the summer of 1951, the Phystech department at MSU was shut down.

A group of academicians, backed by Air Force general Ivan Fedorovich Petrov, who was a Phystech supporter influential enough to secure Stalin&#x27;s personal approval on the issue, succeeded in re-establishing Phystech as an independent institute. On September 17, 1951, a government decree re-established Phystech as the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.

Apart from Kapitsa, other prominent scientists who taught at MIPT in the years that followed included Nobel prize winners Nikolay Semyonov, Lev Landau, Alexandr Prokhorov, Vitaly Ginzburg; and Academy of Sciences members Sergey Khristianovich, Mikhail Lavrentiev, Mstislav Keldysh, Sergey Korolyov and Boris Rauschenbach. MIPT alumni include Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, the 2010 winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics.
==The Phystech System==
The key principles of the Phystech System, as outlined by Kapitsa in his 1946 letter arguing for the founding of MIPT:
*Rigorous selection of gifted and creative young individuals.
*Involving leading scientists in student education, in close contact with them in their creative environment.
*An individualized approach to encourage the cultivation of students&#x27; creative drive and to avoid overloading them with unnecessary subjects and rote learning common in other schools and necessitated by mass education.
*Conducting their education in an atmosphere of research and creative engineering, using the best existing laboratories in the country.

==Departments==
In 2016, a large-scale reform took place, and MIPT has since been divided into Phystech schools, created from the ex-faculties:

* Phystech School of Radio Engineering and Computer Technology (PRCT or FRKT; , ФРКТ)

* Landau Phystech School of Physics and Research (LPR or LFI; , ЛФИ)
*Phystech School of Aerospace Technology (PAST or FAСT; , ФАКТ)
* Phystech School of Electronics, Photonics and Molecular Physics (PEPM or FEFM; , ФЭФМ)
* Phystech School of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (PAMCS or FPMI; , ФПМИ)
*Phystech School of Biological and Medical Physics (PBMP or FBMF; , ФБМФ)
*I.V. Kurchatov Phystech School of Nature-like, Plasma and Nuclear Technologies (KST or KNT; , КНТ)
* Phystech School of High-Tech Business (PHTB or FBVT; , ФБВТ)
* Higher School of Software Engineering (HSSE or VShPI; , ВШПИ)

Despite the formation of new departments, students and teachers of the Institute often continue to use the old names of faculties. For example, LPR students are usually called &quot;fopfs&quot; () in honor of the former Department of General and Applied Physics (DGAP, , ФОПФ). 

==Admissions==
Most students apply to MIPT immediately after graduating from high school at the age of 18. Traditionally, applicants were required to take written and oral exams in both mathematics and physics, write an essay and have an interview with the faculty. In recent years, oral exams have been eliminated, but the interview remains an important part of the selection process. The strongest performers in national physics and mathematics competitions and IMO/IPhO participants are granted admission without exams, subject only to the interview.

In accordance with the traditions of the Soviet education system, education at MIPT is free for most students. Further, students receive small scholarships (as of 2020, $70–105 for bachelor&#x27;s and $110–140 for master&#x27;s degree per month, depending on the student&#x27;s performance) and rather cheap (as of 2020, $13–20 per month, depending on location and comfort) housing on campus.

==Education==
It normally takes six years for a student to graduate from MIPT. The curriculum of the first three years consists exclusively of compulsory courses, with emphasis on mathematics, physics and English. There are no significant curriculum differences between the departments in the first three years. A typical course load during the first and second years can be over 48 hours a week, not including homework. Classes are taught five days a week, beginning at 9:00 am or 10:30 am and continuing until 5:00 pm, 6:30 pm, or 8:00 pm. Most subjects include a combination of lectures and seminars (problem-solving study sessions in smaller groups) or laboratory experiments. Lecture attendance is optional, while seminar and lab attendance affects grades. Andre Geim, a graduate and Nobel prize winner stated &quot;The pressure to work and to study was so intense that it was not a rare thing for people to break and leave and some of them ended up with everything from schizophrenia to depression to suicide.&quot;

MIPT follows a semester system. Each semester includes 15 weeks of instruction, two weeks of finals and then three weeks of oral and written exams on the most important subjects covered in the preceding semester. Starting with the third year, the curriculum matches each student&#x27;s area of specialization and also includes more elective courses. Most importantly, starting with the third year, students begin work at &quot;base institutes&quot; (or &quot;base organizations,&quot; usually simply called &quot;bases&quot;). The bases are the core of the Phystech system. Most of them are research institutes, usually belonging to the Russian Academy of Sciences. At the time of enrollment, each student is assigned to a base that matches his or her interests. Starting with the third year, a student begins to commute to their base regularly, becoming essentially a part-time employee. During the last two years, a student spends 4–5 days a week at their base institute and only one day at MIPT.

The base organization idea is somewhat similar to an internship in that students participate in &quot;real work.&quot; However, the similarity ends there. All base organizations also have a curriculum for visiting students and besides their work, the students are required to take those classes and pass exams. In other words, a base organization is an extension of MIPT, specializing in each particular student&#x27;s area of interests. While working at the base organization, a student prepares a thesis based on his or her research work and presents (&quot;defends&quot;) it before the Qualification Committee consisting of both MIPT faculty and the base organization staff. Defending the thesis is a requirement for graduation.

===Base organizations===
As of 2005, MIPT had 103 base organizations. The following list of institutes is currently far from being complete:
*Center for Arms Control, Energy and Environmental Studies (established 1991) 
*Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology RAS
*Gromov Flight Research Institute
*Institute for Information Transmission Problems RAS
*Institute for Nuclear Research RAS
*Institute for Physical Problems
*Institute for High Energy Physics (1963)
*Institute for Problems in Mechanics RAS
*Institute for Spectroscopy Russian Academy of Sciences
*Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics
*Institute of Biochemical Physics RAS
*Institute of Molecular Genetics RAS
*Institute of Numerical Mathematics RAS
*Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics RAS (1956)
*Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics of RAS
*Institute of Solid State Physics RAS
*Institute of Synthetic Polymer Materials RAS
*Joint Institute for Nuclear Research
*Kurchatov Institute (formerly Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy)
*Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics
*Lebedev Institute of Physics RAS (FIAN)
*Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering
*N.N. Andreyev Acoustics Institute
*N.N. Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics, RAS
*Nuclear Safety Institute of RAS (IBRAE)
*Shirshov Institute of Oceanology
*Shubnikov Institute of Crystallography RAS
*Space Research Institute RAS (1965)
*Steklov Institute of Mathematics
*Zhukovsky Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute
*and a number of OKBs (experimental design bureaux)
In addition, a number of Russian and Western companies act as base organizations of MIPT. These include:

*1C Company
*ABBYY
*Competentum Group or Physicon
*NPMP &quot;Concept Consulting&quot;
*Intel
*IPG Photonics
*Kraftway
*MetaSynthesis
*Paragon Software Group
*S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia
*SWsoft
*Yandex

== Degrees ==
Before 1998, students could graduate only after completing the full six-year curriculum and defending their thesis. Upon graduation, they were awarded a specialist degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics and, beginning in the early 1990s, a Master&#x27;s degree in Physics. Since 1998, students have been awarded a Bachelor&#x27;s degree diploma after four years of study and the defense of a Bachelor&#x27;s &quot;qualification work&quot; (effectively a smaller and less involved version of the Master&#x27;s thesis).

The full course of education at MIPT takes six years to complete, just like an American bachelor&#x27;s degree followed by a master&#x27;s degree. The MIPT curriculum is more extensive compared to an average American college according to the school. There is an opinion at the school that an MIPT specialist/Master&#x27;s diploma may be roughly equivalent to an American PhD in physics.

==Rankings==
In 2020 and 2021, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; ranked MIPT #201 in the world, in 2022 QS World University Ratings ranked it #290 in the world, in 2026 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked it #475 in the world, and in 2022 &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; ranked it #501 in the world.

Traditional university rankings are often based in part on the universities&#x27; research output and prizes won by faculty.

==People==

===Demographics===
About 15% of all students are residents of Moscow and nearly the same are from Moscow region; the rest come from all over the former Soviet Union. The student population is almost exclusively male, with the female/male ratio in a department rarely exceeding 15% (seeing 2–3 women in a class of 80 is not uncommon). In 2009 more than 20% of first year students were females.

There are no reliable statistics on the careers of MIPT graduates.

<text>Blomberg is a town in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, with c. 15,100 inhabitants (2019).

==History==

===City founding and life in the late Middle Ages===

Today&#x27;s urban area was settled between the 6th and 8th centuries AD during the course of the old Saxon expansion. During this time, the region&#x27;s villages ending in -trup emerged, such as Herrentrup, Istrup, Wellentrup, Brüntrup, Tintrup and Höntrup. The term -trup means -dorf (cf thorp) and was formed through metathesis over time.

In the 11th century, the population grew significantly. Up until then, the farmers had worked with primitive agricultural methods that did not allow profitable cultivation of the soil. This situation changed with the introduction of the iron wheeled plough, the three-field system and the water mill in the High Middle Ages and led to more productive harvests that improved the food situation. This also made the Lippe region interesting for the ruling class. The new rulers were the Lords of Lippe and the Counts of Schwalenberg and Stambuberg. It is believed that both shared Blomberg Castle, which initially only served as a fortress.

Between 1231 and 1255 Blomberg was founded as a city by Bernhard III. The documents about it were lost in the course of the Soest feud, so that there is no exact date. However, there is a document from the year 1283, which shows that the city rights had existed &quot;for a long time&quot; at that time. Blomberg was apparently of particular importance to the Lippe sovereigns because the town was located at the crossroads of three important medieval trade routes. These long-distance routes were the Cologne Road, which led to Hameln via Soest, Horn and Blomberg , and the Frankfurt Road, which led via Kassel, Warburg, Steinheim, Blomberg and Rinteln to Bremen and finally the road from Osnabrück via Herford, Lemgo, Blomberg, Höxter and on to Thuringia. In the extensive forests, gangs of robbers also threatened the traffic of the time and the roads in the Blomberg area were secured by six watchtowers.

The city was built according to the traditional three-street system, in which three parallel longitudinal streets meet at the ends in front of a city gate. The area of the approximately 11.3 hectare city was planned for 1,600 inhabitants and only expanded after 1860, i.e. almost 600 years later, beyond its border to the east. Simon I (1275-1344) chose Blomberg as his residence and had the castle expanded as a residence. He and his successors frequently moved between their homes in Blomberg and Brake. The town and castle were fortified all around, and the castle was additionally secured by a rampart and moat. Steep slopes offered natural protection to the west and south, while to the east and north the city was surrounded by walls, moats, ramparts, and even thorn hedges. In addition, there were six defensive towers as well as Zwinger and Landwehr in front of the gates. The Lower Gate and parts of the city wall of the city fortifications are still preserved today.

In Blomberg there was a certain division into upper and lower town, mostly the craftsmen lived upstairs and the farmers downstairs. Upper and lower town had separate dogs and even the municipal inns were distributed in exact numbers between upper and lower town. Children from the upper town were taught by the cantor and those from the lower town by the sexton. As everywhere in the cities, Blomberg&#x27;s economy was determined by the guild system. Almost all handicraft businesses in the Blomberg Basin were concentrated in the city, only millers, blacksmiths, wheel makers, cobblers and patch cutters could also settle in the countryside.

===Destruction, reconstruction and reformation===

Blomberg&#x27;s fortifications did not protect the city from total destruction in the course of the Soest feud. In 1447, the Archbishop of Cologne besieged the city and on June 14 had his mercenaries almost completely burn it to the ground.

The city was rebuilt from 1468 with the support of Bernhard VII. A momentous event took place during this time. A woman named Alheyd Pustekoke stole 45 consecrated wafers from the Martini church. Fearing discovery, she threw them into the well in the Seligen Winkel. But the hosts did not sink, Alheyd was convicted of theft and burned at the stake as punishment. Soon after, word spread that the fountain had miraculous healing powers and Blomberg became a place of pilgrimage. News of this even reached the Vatican so the cardinals in Rome encouraged the building of a chapel over the fountain. 1468 got the Augustinian canons in the Möllenbeck monastery gave this church and at the same time received permission to build a monastery. The church was expanded into a late Gothic hall church in 1473 and is today the Protestant-Reformed town parish church. The donations were so substantial that a monastery church could be built, which for almost 200 years served as the burial place of Lippe&#x27;s noble lords and counts. It has not been historically clarified whether the trial against Alheyd Pustekoke is to be classified as a &quot;witch trial&quot;.

At a total of five state parliaments in Cappel, the towns and knights decided in 1538 to introduce a Protestant church order for Lippe and Blomberg converted to the Evangelical Lutheran faith. The fountain lost its supra-local importance and fell into oblivion. The second Reformation took place in 1605. Sovereign Count Simon VI ordered the evangelical-reformed confession of John Calvin to be introduced in all towns and communities in the County of Lippe. Only Lemgo successfully resisted, while Blomberg reluctantly submitted.

===Thirty Years&#x27; War and economic development===
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618-1648), Blomberg was again severely damaged when enemy troops plundered the city in August 1636. In the course of the war, the Blomberg citizens were hit by a devastating plague epidemic and the population fell from 1640 to 675 people within a short time. The city only slowly recovered from the horrors of war and it was not until 1834 that its former population was reached again.

In 1589 three women from Donop and Kleinenmarpe were accused and executed in a witch trial in Blomberg. In Wellentrup, between 1589 and 1674, three men and two women were involved in witch trials. On March 10, 2015, the City Council of Blomberg rehabilitated the victims of the witch trials from a socio-ethical and moral point of view.

A few merchants settled on Blomberg&#x27;s main streets, the Langen and Kurzen Steinwegs, some of whose stately hall houses from the 16th and 17th centuries have survived to this day. According to the Lippe census of 1776, there was a diverse craft and commercial structure in Blomberg. These included 84 shoemakers, 30 harness makers, 30 farmers and carters, 15 carpenters, 13 bakers, 10 scribes, 8 linen weavers, 7 locksmiths, 6 blacksmiths, 3 innkeepers, 3 hat makers, 3 glaziers, 3 butchers, 3 bathers and surgeons, 3 traders, 3 masons, 2 apothecaries, 2 wheel makers and 2 carpenters.

The shoemaking trade developed in the 18th century. Even today, the cobbler&#x27;s lantern is the symbol of Blomberg&#x27;s craftsmanship. At times more than 100 shoemakers worked in the city and sent their products to Kassel, Osnabrück, Hanover and Braunschweig.

===Industrialization===

At the beginning of the 19th century, the timber industry became the economic focus. In 1805 already 5000 chairs were manufactured and sold on foreign markets. The Krone chair factory was founded in 1880 and in 1893 Bernd Hausmann set up the first plywood factory in Germany. At the beginning of the 19th century, Friedrich Vöchting and Carl Gronemann began cultivating carnations on the former dairy site. Eventually, there were over 1500 varieties of carnation exported around the world up until the First World War. This gave Blomberg the nickname Carnation City.

In the years 1835 to 1895 Blomberg&#x27;s population grew from 2141 to 3084 people. Especially in the last decade of the 19th century, there was an economic upswing when Blomberg was connected to the railway network. A branch line was opened in 1897, connecting the city to the Altenbeken–Hannover railway line. Despite the first signs of industrial development, agriculture remained an important economic factor, although often as a sideline. As late as the mid-1920s, 700 of the 1,000 resident households were still cultivating up to two hectares of field or garden. [18]

===World War I and the Weimar Republic===
During the First World War (1914-1918), 180 Blombergers were killed or have been missing since then. After the end of the war, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated and Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the republic on November 9, 1918. A day later, the Lippe People&#x27;s and Soldiers&#x27; Council was constituted in Detmold and formed the new Lippe government. Just two days later, the People&#x27;s Council of the City of Blomberg was founded in Blomberg, which was made up of workers and soldiers. Gatherings on the streets were banned, children were no longer allowed to be outside after dark and young people after 9 p.m. After this proclamation, the red flag of the revolution was hoisted at City Hall. According to recent historical research, the majority of the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils did not belong to the extreme left, but to the MSPD and the moderate members of the USPD. At the Berlin Reich Council Congress at the end of 1918, a clear majority of the delegates decided against a council republic and in favor of the earliest possible elections to the National Assembly, after which the SPD formed the first government of the Weimar Republic. Prince Leopold IV of Lippe-Biesterfeld abdicated in Lippe and the Principality of Lippe became a free state within the German Empire.

In March 1920, as a reaction to the Kapp Putsch, there was a general strike in which 650 Blomberg workers from 25 companies took part. In the last years of the Weimar Republic, there were violent clashes between supporters of the KPD and NSDAP in Lippe, as in the entire Reich, some of which degenerated into hall battles and shootings. [18]

===Nazism and World War II===

On January 15, 1933, state elections were held in Lippe. In the Reichstag elections in November 1932, the NSDAP had to accept a decline in their share of the vote from 41.13% to 34.72%. That is why the Nazis tried to win the state elections in Lippe at all costs. The entire leadership of the NSDAP was involved in the election campaign and in the final phase of the election campaign Hitler alone spoke in Lippe sixteen times within ten days. On January 13, Hitler and Frick addressed 5,000 people in Blomberg. In the election, the NSDAP was able to increase by almost 10% and achieved 43.4% of the votes, while the SPD took only 26.6% and the KPD 15.9% of the votes. The NSDAP declared the election victory in Lippe as Hitler&#x27;s breakthrough on his way to the Reich Chancellery, but in fact the decision was made in Berlin, when Reich President Hindenburg gave in to the pressure of the conservatives and appointed Hitler Reich Chancellor. After that, the Nazis immediately expanded their power and suspended elementary basic rights. As part of the so-called “Gleichschaltung” the other political parties, trade unions and many associations were banned and most of the leading positions in politics, administration and all of public life were occupied by the NSDAP. Anyone who did not fit into the &quot;national community&quot; was persecuted and imprisoned.

On March 6, 1933, the first functionaries and members of the KPD in Blomberg were taken into so-called protective custody. Thereafter, 14 house searches were carried out on members of the SPD. The increasing reprisals by the SA and the police led to resignations in many parts of the SPD. On April 1, 1933, the Blomberg SPD local association dissolved. One victim of the Nazis was the upholsterer Wilhelm Friedrichs, who wrote a number of letters critical of the regime to Nazi functionaries in Blomberg and Detmold. He was arrested and taken to a prison in Hanover, where he hanged himself the day before the court hearing. [18] It is known from Jewish citizens of Blomberg that the Königsheim family went to Argentina under pressure from the Nazis emigrated. The last Jewish resident of Blomberg was 70-year-old Emma Lippert, née Examus, who was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and on to Minsk , where she was murdered. Since then there has been no Jewish community in Blomberg. The simple half-timbered synagogue from 1808 is now used as the city archive.

The cityscape of Blomberg survived the Second World War largely unscathed. At the beginning of April 1945, the Americans crossed the Teutoburg Forest and reached Detmold. Further east, in the area to the right of Reichsstrasse 1, the US 83rd Infantry Division operated and pushed northeast through Blomberg. US soldiers cleared the anti-tank barriers at the dairy and did not encounter any significant resistance since the SS units had left the city earlier. Blomberg was handed over by the mayor on April 5, 1945 and occupied by the Americans without a fight while their tanks continued to Hagen and Lügde. During World War II, 205 Blombergers were killed and 105 are missing.

===Post-war and present===
From 1945 to 1952, Blomberg had to take in a total of 1,500 displaced persons from the Baltic States. In 1957, the Phoenix Contact company set up its headquarters in Blomberg. From 1962 to 1996, a Dutch unit of 1,600 soldiers and their family members were stationed on behalf of NATO in the so-called Nederlandspark in the south of the Blomberg industrial area. They formed a not inconsiderable economic factor for the city. In 1970 this was done by the Bielefeld Lawthe municipal reorganization, in the course of which a total of 17 previously independent municipalities were assigned as districts to the core city of Blomberg. The number of inhabitants has almost doubled and grew from 7761 to 15,299 people. The core town is not only the administrative centre for Blomberg, but also serves as a medium-sized centre for an area with up to 60,000 inhabitants. In 1973, planning began for a comprehensive redevelopment of the historic city centre. The official completion of the work was the unveiling of the Alheyd fountain on the market square in 1989.

On March 7, 2005, French President Jacques Chirac and Federal Chancellor Schröder met in the Burghotel Blomberg. In 2008 Blomberg celebrated the 725th anniversary of the founding of the city with many activities and events as well as a city festival from August 15 to 17.

== Geography ==
Blomberg is 45 km south east of Bielefeld, 20 km east of Detmold and 17 km south west towards Bad Pyrmont. The district is located in the southern foothills of the Lippe mountain range and in the area of Blomberger and Schwalenberger Heights.

The core city is located in the center of the so-called Blomberger basin, which lies about 150 m above sea level and clearly separates itself from the surrounding area. The hem of the basin to the north and east are the approximately 400 m high wooded ridges of Barntruper and Blomberger Stadtwald with the Dicker, Becker and Winterberg. To the west are the Hörntruper Berg, the Meierberg, the Mossenberg (228 m) and the Püllenberg (261 m), while the border in the south of Nessenberg (235 m), Spielberg (239 m) and Steinberg (342 m) is formed. The drainage of the eastern part of the Blomberger basin is made by the Diestel, a left tributary of the Emmer. Between the districts Istrup and Großenmarpe a watershed has formed. For this reason, the western part of the Blomberg basin is drained via the Marpe and its tributaries towards Bega / Werre. The lowest point of the municipality is at 139 m, the highest is the summit of the winter mountain at 429 m.

== Geology ==
The municipality is located on the southern flank of the Pyrmont-Piesberger axis, there are almost exclusively rocks of the Middle (Km) and Upper Keupers (Ko) open-minded. The rock strata, which were once stored horizontally in the Middle Ages, were raised in the Tertiary around 30 million years ago and formed the Blomberger Sattel.

By erosion in the center of the saddle the older gray and red marl of the Middle Keuper (Km1) were uncovered, which is also called Gipskeuper because of switched-on layers of gypsum. The result was the clearly recognizable pelvic structure, this phenomenon is called relief reversal. The reed sandstone (Km2) then forms a first striking terrain level. The city itself is located on the western edge of this steep step. The reed sandstone was obtained in small quarries as quarry stone for construction purposes. The marls of the so-called Red Wall (Km3) are susceptible to weathering, only the following harder stone marls (Km4) give rise to another stage in the terrain. The outermost edge of the basin structure consists of harder rock layers of the Upper Keuper (Ko) Rätkeuper.

In the Tertiary it came in the inner basin edges consisting of gypsum Keuper to the dissolution of plaster layers. Through this process, also called subrosion, formed hollows. These were backfilled with the weathering marls from the immediate area. Because of their high clay content, these sediments formed the raw material basis for some brickworks. In the basin itself, loess has deposited in the course of the last ice age and weathered to loess clay. The amount of deposits is up to 150 cm and is responsible for the good to very good quality of arable land.

The old Kleinstadt, classified district, covers an area of 99.12 km². The municipality has a maximum extent in east-west direction of about 12½ km and in north-south direction of about 15½ km.

The vast majority of the land is used by agriculture, in the area of wet creek lowlands mainly as grassland and pastures. The forest on the surrounding mountains consists of three quarters of deciduous trees, mostly beech, while on the Rätkeuper spruce cultures thrive. In comparison to the NRW state average of 49.4%, the agricultural area in Blomberg is 60%, while the forest area is 25.4% (NRW) and 26.5% (Blomberg).

Extensive areas of the Blomberg urban area are good to very good for the use of geothermal heat sources using geothermal probes and heat generated by heat pump. In the central and southern urban area, however, the suitability is rather mediocre, and in some cases poor (see the adjacent map).

== Neighbouring communities ==
The neighbouring communities are Bad Pyrmont, (in Landkreis Hameln-Pyrmont, Niedersachsen), Lügde, Schieder-Schwalenberg, Horn-Bad Meinberg, Detmold, Lemgo, Dörentrup and Barntrup (all in Kreis Lippe).

== Villages ==
The Blomberg city area belongs to the maritime climate area of northwest Germany. The winters are usually mild under Atlantic influence, the summers moderately warm and the rainfall relatively evenly distributed. The average annual temperature is around 9 °C. Monthly average varies from around 0 °C in January to 17 °C in July / August. The annual rainfall is around 900 mm. The average annual solar radiation is 955 kilowatt hours per square meter.
