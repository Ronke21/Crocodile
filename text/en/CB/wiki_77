<text>Gerbert de Montreuil was a 13th-century French poet from the north of France.

He wrote &quot;Le Roman de la violette&quot; or &quot;Gérard de Nevers&quot;, one of the most outstanding medieval poems, famous for its vivid narrative and faithful depiction of contemporary customs. The poem underwent countless adaptations and imitations. It tells the trials of the unfortunate and innocent Euriaut, who becomes an object of public dispute between Gérard de Nevers and Lisiard de Forez, the former taking her defense while the other suggests she is guilty of misconduct by claiming he knows of a violet-shaped mark on her bosom. The story percolated into Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; via Giovanni Boccaccio, and into Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s opera &quot;Euryanthe&quot;.
Gerbert is possibly the author of &quot;Gerbert&#x27;s Continuation&quot;, one of the Four Continuations of Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;.

<text>Jorge Montt Álvarez (; April 26, 1845 – October 8, 1922) was a vice admiral in the Chilean Navy and president of Chile from 1891 to 1896.

==Early life==
Born in Casablanca, Chile, He was a nephew of previous Chilean president Manuel Montt, and a cousin of future president Pedro Montt. After graduating from the naval academy in 1861, he served in the Chincha Islands War (1864-1866) and the War of the Pacific (1879-1883). He led the 1891 Chilean Civil War against President José Manuel Balmaceda to become provisional leader and eventually president in 1891.

==Presidency==
The close of the revolution against Balmaceda left the government of Chile in the hands of the junta under whose guidance the military and naval operations had been organized. Admiral Jorge Montt had been the head of this revolutionary committee, and he acted as president of the provisional government when the administration of the country changed hands after the victory of the Congressional party. An election was then immediately ordered to elect the president of the republic as well as representatives in the senate and chamber of deputies. Admiral Montt, as head of the executive power, staunchly refused to allow official influence to be brought to bear in any way in the presidential campaign. The great majority of the voters, however, required no pressure to decide who was in their opinion the man most fit to administer the affairs of the republic.

An election was held, and Admiral Montt was duly chosen by a nearly unanimous vote to be chief magistrate for the remaining time of the constitutional term of five years, till September 18, 1896. The senate and chamber of deputies were formally constituted in due course, and the government of the republic resumed normal conditions of existence. The new president showed admirable tact in dealing with the difficult problem he was called upon to face. Party feeling still ran high between the partisans of the two sides of the recent conflict. Admiral Montt took the view that it was politic and just to let bygones be bygones, and he acted conscientiously by this principle in all administrative measures in connection with the supporters of the late President Balmaceda. Early in 1892, amnesty was granted to the officers of the Balmaceda regime, and they were freely permitted to return to Chile without any attempts made against them. The first political act of national importance of the new government was the granting of control to the municipalities, which hitherto had possessed little power to direct local affairs and were not even permitted to make spending decisions of the municipal revenues to any important amount without first obtaining the consent of the central government. Almost absolute power was now given these corporations to manage their own concerns, and the organization of the police was placed in their hands; at a later period, however, it was found necessary to modify this latter condition.

President Montt next turned his attention towards the question of how to best repair the damage caused to the country by eight months of civil warfare. The plan of public works authorized in 1887 was reconsidered, and the construction of portions of the various undertakings recommenced. The army and navy were reorganized. Additional instructors were brought from Germany, and all arms of the military service were placed on a thoroughly efficient footing in matters of drill and discipline. Several new and powerful cruisers were added to the navy, and the internal economy of this branch of the national defence was thoroughly inspected; many defects were remedied.

President Montt then took in hand the question of a reform of the currency, the abolition of nonconvertible paper money, and the re-establishment of a gold monetary standard for the republic. This reform of the currency became the keynote of the president&#x27;s policy during the remainder of his term of office. Great opposition was raised by the representatives of the debtor class in congress to the suppression of the nonconvertible paper money, but in the end President Montt carried the day, and on February 11, 1895 a measure finally became law establishing a gold currency as the only tender in Chile. In July 1896, the Conversion Act was put in force, a dollar of 18d. being the monetary unit adopted.

In 1895, relations with the neighbouring republic of Argentina began to become somewhat strained in regard to the interpretation of the treaty concerning the boundary between the two countries. The treaties of 1881, 1893 and 1895 left doubts in the minds of both Chileans and Argentines as to the position of the frontier line. On April 17, 1896, another protocol was drawn up, by which the contending parties agreed to submit any differences to the arbitration of Great Britain, at the instance of one or both governments. President Montt had now fulfilled his term of office, and on September 18, 1896 he handed over the presidential power to his successor, Federico Errázuriz Echaurren, who had been duly elected in the month of June previously.

==Post-presidency==
Montt served as commander of the Chilean Navy from 1897 until his retirement in 1913. He then served as mayor of Valparaiso from 1915 to 1918.
He died in Santiago in 1922.

<text>Pedro Elías Pablo Montt Montt (; 29 June 1849, Santiago, Chile – 16 August 1910, Bremen, Germany) was a Chilean political figure. He served as the president of Chile from 1906 to his death from a probable stroke in 1910. His government furthered railroad and manufacturing activities but ignored pressing social and labour problems.

==Biography==
The son of the former Chilean president Manuel Montt Torres and Rosario Montt Goyenechea, Pedro Montt graduated in law from the National Institute in 1870. He was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1876 and became its president in 1885. Montt held two posts in the cabinet of President José Manuel Balmaceda, but in 1891 he took an active part in the revolution that overthrew Balmaceda. He then went to the United States, first as an agent of the revolutionary junta and later (after U.S. recognition) as Minister.

Unsuccessful in his first bid for the presidency in 1901, Montt was elected by a large majority in 1906 as the candidate of the National Union ticket. His first action was to call out the army to suppress large-scale strikes in 1907, which resulted in the Santa María School massacre. His administration supported the construction of a railway that ran the length of the country and stimulated the production of nitrates and copper. It did little, however, to improve the living conditions of the people. In 1909, then-child-prodigy pianist Claudio Arrau played for Montt, who was so taken by the performance that he authorized a ten-year grant from the Chilean government for Arrau to study in Europe. In 1910, Montt left Chile for medical treatment in Germany, but died before he could return to Chile.

<text>Manuel Francisco Antonio Julián Montt Torres (; September 4, 1809 – September 21, 1880) was a Chilean statesman and scholar. He was twice elected President of Chile between 1851 and 1861.

==Biography==
Montt was born in Petorca, Valparaíso Region, the son of Catalan immigrants. His family was very poor, and in 1822 the death of his father increased their hardship. The same year, Manuel&#x27;s mother secured his entrance into the Instituto Nacional (&quot;National Institute&quot;, where he would later serve as rector from 1835 to 1840), though he could only afford the fees by tutoring other students. After studying law at the Instituto Nacional, he graduated as a lawyer in 1833 and soon achieved prominent academic and government posts.

Montt had a distinguished career as a scholar, and was introduced into public life during the presidency (1831–1841) of José Joaquín Prieto by Diego Portales. Montt distinguished himself by his courage in the crisis that followed upon Portales&#x27; assassination in 1837, though only holding a subordinate post in the government. In 1840, Montt was elected to the National Congress of Chile. He served as minister of the interior and minister of justice under President Manuel Bulnes (in office from 1841 to 1851). He emphasized the need for educational and scientific progress in the Chile, and was Minister of public instruction for a time. He was also twice Minister of Interior and Foreign Affairs during the Bulnes administration.

In 1849, botanist Claude Gay named &quot;Monttea&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from Argentina and Chile, belonging to the family Plantaginaceae in Manuel Montt&#x27;s honour.

===Presidency===
In 1851 Montt won the Chilean presidency, but the liberals regarded his election as fraudulent and instigated an armed revolt, the Revolution of 1851, which was quickly subdued. Montt represented the conservative oligarchy and was authoritarian and inflexible in his beliefs, but he also worked for the economic and social progress of his nation. He angered the conservatives when he asserted the state&#x27;s right of patronage in Chile&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church and when he supported the abolition of restrictions on the sale or bequeathing of landed estates. His administration made advances in commerce and banking, codified Chilean laws, strongly promoted public education and immigration, and colonized the area south of the Bío-Bío River.

Manuel Montt, as Chile&#x27;s first civilian president, furthered the reforms begun by Diego Portales. With Vicente Perez Rosales, the Minister of Immigration, he encouraged the settlement of German immigrants in the south of the country. The city of Puerto Montt, at the centre of the newly settled lands, honours his name. He governed Chile with an energy and wisdom that laid the foundation of her material prosperity. He was ably assisted by his minister of the interior Antonio Varas, and from the co-operation of the two statesmen the well-known ultra-conservative faction, the Montt-Varistas, took their name. His presidency featured the establishment of railways, telegraphs, banks, schools and training-colleges. Near the end of his second term, when Montt indicated a preference for Varas, his minister of the interior, to become his successor, liberals again staged an armed uprising (1859). Montt again subdued the revolt, but pacified the liberals by shifting his support to José Joaquín Pérez, who was a moderate.

===Later life===
On giving up the presidency in 1861, Montt became President of the Supreme Court of Chile, a position which he held up to his death in September 1880. Manuel Montt&#x27;s nephew Jorge (born 1846) served as president of Chile in 1891–1896, as did Manuel Montt&#x27;s son, Pedro (died 1910), between 1906 and 1910.

Manuel Montt died in Santiago de Chile on September 21, 1880, he was 71 years old. He gives his name to the town of Puerto Montt.

<text>Edmond Gore Alexander Holmes (17 July 1850 – 14 October 1936) was an educationalist, writer and poet.

==Biography==

Holmes was born in Moycashel, County Westmeath, Ireland. His father was Robert Holmes and his mother was Jane Henn (1824-1905).

His &quot;The Creed of the Buddha&quot; (1908) is well known; he also wrote a pantheist text &quot;All is One: A Plea for a Higher Pantheism&quot;.

In 1901 he was a school inspector. Katherine Bathurst who had a troubled career was transferred from Wales to work under his supervision. Disputes between them includes expenses, timetables and Bathurst&#x27;s objections to Holmes amending her reports. The Oxford Education Committee complained about her and she was given six months probation in February 1904 and in the following month female inspectors were moved to a new organisation as proposed by Robert Morant. Bathurst was sent to Manchester.

Holmes rose to become chief inspector for elementary schools in 1905. He resigned in 1911, over a confidential memorandum criticising school inspectors who had formerly been elementary school teachers. This angered the teachers&#x27; union and it led to the downfall of Robert Morant the permanent secretary to the Board of Education when it became public.

Holmes subsequent writings on education are taken as an early statement of &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;child-centred&quot; positions, and are still cited. Later works come close to theosophy. For example, even a 1914 book review of his &quot;In Defence of What Might Be&quot; describes it as &quot;pregnant with possibilities for the untrammeled soul of the growing child. A draft of fresh air into static pedagogy.&quot;

Words from his &quot;The Triumph of Love&quot; were set to music by the composer Charles Villiers Stanford, a friend.

== Personal life ==
Holmes married Florence Mary Syme (d. 1927) in 1880 and they had three children, two daughters and a son. Daughter Verena Holmes went on to become a leading early woman engineer and only son Maurice Gerald Holmes(1885–1964) became a British civil servant.

<text>Antoine Jean Baptiste Robert Auget, Baron de Montyon (23 December 173329 December 1820) was a French philanthropist, born in Paris.

==Biography==
His father was a &quot;maître des comptes&quot;; he was educated in law, and became a lawyer at the Châtelet in 1755, &quot;maître des requêtes&quot; to the Conseil d&#x27;État in 1760, and intendant successively of Auvergne, Provence and La Rochelle. He had repeatedly shown great independence of character, protesting against the accusation of Louis-René de Caradeuc de La Chalotais in 1766, and refusing in 1771 to suppress the local courts of justice in obedience to Maupeou. He was made a councillor of state in 1775 by the influence of Louis de Bourbon, duke of Penthièvre, and in 1780 he was attached to the court in the honorary office of chancellor to the comte d&#x27;Artois (afterwards Charles X). He followed the princes into exile, and lived for some years in London. During the emigration period he spent large sums on the alleviation of the poverty of his fellow immigrants, returning to France only at the second restoration.

Between 1780 and 1787 he had founded a series of prizes, the awards to be made by the French academy and the academies of science and medicine. These prizes fell into abeyance during the revolutionary period, but were re-established in 1815. In 1812 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

When Montyon died, he bequeathed 12,000 francs for the perpetual endowment of each of the Montyon prizes: for the discovery of the means of rendering some mechanical process less dangerous to the workman; for the perfecting of any technical improvement in a mechanical process; for the book which during the year rendered the greatest service to humanity; the &quot;prix de vertu&quot; for the most courageous act on the part of a poor Frenchman; the awards being left as before to the learned academies. He also left 12,000 francs to each of the Parisian hospitals.

Montyon wrote a series of works, chiefly on political economy:
* &quot;Éloge de Michel de l&#x27;hôpital&quot; (Paris, 1777)
* &quot;Recherches et considérations sur la population de la France&quot; (1778), a share of which is attributed to his secretary, Moheau
* &quot;Rapport fait à Louis XVIII&quot; (Constance, 1796), in which he maintained in opposition to Calonne&#x27;s &quot;Tableau de l&#x27;Europe&quot; that France had always possessed a constitution, which had, however, been violated by the kings of France
* &quot;L&#x27;état statistique du Tunkin&quot; (1811) ; and &quot;Particularités... sur les ministres des finances en France&quot; (1812).

<text>Jacques Marie Boutet (25 March 1745 – 13 February 1812) was a French actor and comic playwright from Lunéville. His pseudonym was Monvel. He was a small, thin man without good looks or voice, and yet he became one of the greatest comedians of his time.

== Biography ==
After some years of apprenticeship in the provinces, he made his debut in 1770 at the Comédie-Française in Merope and Zenaide; he was received sociétaire in 1772. Monvel secretly left Paris for Sweden in 1781, as the head of a troupe of French actors. He became reader to the king, a post which he held for several years. Until 1786, he was the director for the French theatre in Bollhuset and had a great importance for the development for the organisation of the native Swedish theatre as the educator of the first Swedish actors for the Royal Dramatic Theatre, such as Fredrique Löwen, Lars Hjortsberg and Maria Franck, in the modern style of acting; among his troupe of French actors was Anne Marie Milan Desguillons, who was also to have a great importance to the life of the theatre in Sweden.

At the French Revolution he returned to Paris, embraced its principles with ardour, and joined the theatre in the rue Richelieu (the rival of the Comédie-Française), which, under Talma, with Dugazon, his sister Mme Vestris, Grandmesnil (1737–1816) and Mme Desgarcins, was soon to become the Théatre de la République.

After the Revolution, Monvel returned to the reconstituted Comédie-Française with all his old companions, but retired in 1807. Monvel was made a member of the Institute in 1795. He wrote six plays (four of them performed at the Comédie-Française), two comedies, and fifteen libretti for comic operas, seven with music by N. Dezde (1740–1792), eight by Nicolas Dalayrac (1753–1809). He also published an historical novel, Fredgonde et Brunehaut (1776). He was professor of elocution at the Conservatoire.

In the 1780s Monvel fled France and went into a brief exile in Sweden after he was caught making sexual assignations with men in the gardens of the Tuileries.

The actor&#x27;s liaison with actress Jeanne-Marie-Marguerite Salvetat (aka Madame Mars &quot;cadette&quot;) produced one daughter, Anne-Françoise-Hippolyte Boutet Salvetat (known professionally as Mademoiselle Mars), who became a well-known actress.

<doc id="837628" wikidata="Q1041789" url="?curid=837628" title="Greek Heroic Age">
<text>The Greek Heroic Age, in mythology, is the period between the coming of the Greeks to Thessaly and the Greek warriors&#x27; return from Troy. The poet Hesiod ( ) identified this mythological era as one of his five Ages of Man.
The period spans roughly six generations; the heroes denoted by the term are superhuman, though not divine, and are celebrated in the literature of Homer and of others, such as Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides.

The Greek heroes can be grouped into an approximate mythic chronology, based on the stories of events such as the Argonautic expedition and the Trojan War. Over the course of time, many heroes, such as Heracles, Achilles, Hector and Perseus, came to figure prominently in Greek mythology.

==Early heroes==
Many of the early Greek heroes were descended from the gods and were part of the founding narratives of various city-states. They also became the ancestors of later heroes. The Phoenician prince Cadmus, a grandson of Poseidon, was the first Greek hero and the founder of Thebes.

Perseus, famous for his exploits well before the days of his great-grandson, Heracles, was the son of Zeus. Perseus beheaded the gorgon Medusa, saved Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus, and was the legendary founder of Mycenae.

Aeacus was also a son of Zeus. Bellerophon was descended from the nymph Orseis. Oenomaus, king of Pisa, in the Peloponnese, was the son of Ares.

Among these early heroes the three - Cadmus, Perseus and Bellerophon - were considered the greatest Greek heroes and slayers of monsters before the days of Heracles.

* Aeacus
* Bellerophon
* Cadmus 
* Perseus
* Electryon

== Heroes in Art ==
Heroes in the Greek Heroic Age are often depicted on vases, expressing a portion of their story. Greek Hero Heracles is a popular icon among vases and paintings in early art. Moments in history from this period are also captured in statues, such as Perseus with the head of Medusa, the Statue of Achilles, and the Pasquino Group. Polykleitos of Argos is one famous Greek Sculptor that has transformed Greek myth through bronze and marble sculptures, and primarily created a system for reproductions of art to occur.

==Argonauts==
The myth of Jason and the Golden Fleece is one of the oldest stories of a hero&#x27;s quest. Jason sailed on the &quot;Argo&quot;, and those who accompanied him were called the &quot;Argonauts&quot;. Their mission was to travel to the kingdom of Colchis, on the Black Sea, to obtain the &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;, a symbol of authority and kingship. With it, Jason would become king of Iolcos in Thessaly.
The Argonauts:
==Calydonian boar hunt==

A monstrous boar was sent by Artemis to ravage the region of Calydon in Aetolia because its king neglected to honour her in his rites to the gods. King Oeneus sent messengers seeking the best hunters in Greece, offering them the boar&#x27;s pelt and tusks as a prize. A number of heroes responded, including Atalanta, Castor and Pollux, Jason, Laertes, Lynceus, Meleager (the host and boar killer), Nestor, Peleus, Phoenix, and Theseus. Many of them were also the &quot;Argonauts&quot;. One notable exception was Heracles, who vanquished his own Goddess-sent Erymanthian boar separately.

==Others==
== Generation of Oedipus ==
&quot;(about two generations before Troy)&quot;

The story of Oedipus is the basis of a trilogy of plays by Sophocles, however, similar stories have been traced to cultures all over the world.
==Generation of the Seven against Thebes ==
&quot;(about a generation before Troy)&quot;

Oedipus places a curse upon his sons Eteocles and Polynices. The underlying theme in the story of the &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; is the fulfilment of that curse. Although the brothers had agreed to share the rule of Thebes, when it is time for Eteocles to step aside he refuses, and Polynices brings an army against his beloved city to enforce his claim. In Aeschylus&#x27; play the concept of the individual vs. community becomes a central theme. In the &quot;Phoenissae&quot; (The Phoenician Women), patriotism is a significant theme.
==Generation of the Trojan War ==
See Trojan War and Epigoni.

Gregory Nagy sees mortality as the &quot;dominant theme in the stories of ancient Greek heroes.&quot; In heading for Troy, Achilles opts for a short life, leaving a memory of being immortal and renown over a long peaceful life in relative obscurity. 
== Greek Heroes in &quot;The Iliad&quot; ==

Face of the Trojan War, Achilles helped escalate the war after killing the Trojan Prince Hector. A description of the Trojan War is given to audiences through a telling of the myth in the form of a poem by Greek poet Homer, titled &quot;The Iliad&quot;.

<text>William Flavelle Monypenny (7 August 1866 – 23 November 1912) was an Irish-born journalist and editor whose career was split between London and South Africa. He was also the first biographer of Benjamin Disraeli.

Monypenny was the second son of an Ulster family of Scottish descent, born in Ballyworkan, south of Portadown, County Armagh, to William Monypeny, linen manufacturer and small landowner, and Mary Ann Flavell. William spelled his surname Monypeny until 1898. He attended the Royal School Dungannon and Trinity College Dublin, where he distinguished himself in mathematics, earning his BA in 1888. From there he attended Balliol College, Oxford, but left after a year due to ill health.

Monypenny received his start in journalism in London as a contributor to &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He joined the staff of &quot;The Times&quot; in 1893, where he was an assistant to the editor, George Earle Buckle. In early 1899, he accepted an offer to edit the Johannesburg &quot;Star&quot;, then an Uitlander publication in the Transvaal Republic. Monypenny was at the forefront in the subsequent political disputes leading up to the Second Boer War, and was forced to flee to Cape Colony prior to the outbreak of hostilities when a warrant of high treason was taken out against him. During the war, he served in the Imperial Light Horse and saw combat in Natal. He was also a member of the force trapped in Ladysmith during its besiegement by the Boers, which adversely affected his health. Monypenny subsequently served in Lord Milner&#x27;s administration, where he was the director of civil supplies and participated in the rehabilitation of refugees after the annexation of the Transvaal. He was a member of &quot;Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten&quot;.

After the war, Monypenny resumed the editorship of the &quot;Star&quot;, using it to support Milner&#x27;s policies. He was unable to accept the emerging practice of importing Chinese labor, however, and resigned from the editorship in 1903. Upon his return to London, he resumed working for &quot;The Times&quot;, and was appointed a director of the Times Publishing Company in 1908. It was his work with &quot;The Times&quot; which led the directors to offer to him the opportunity to write the definitive biography of the former prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, using the papers Disraeli had bequeathed to his former secretary Lord Rowton. Though Monypenny&#x27;s relative obscurity led some to question his selection, the first volume was critically praised upon his publication in October 1910. Monypenny only completed one more volume before dying of heart failure in 1912; the project was completed by George Earle Buckle, who wrote an additional four volumes. His work &quot;The Two Irish Nations; an Essay on Home Rule&quot; was published posthumously in 1913.

<text>Anatole de Monzie (; 22 November 1876, Bazas, Gironde – 11 January 1947, Paris) was a French administrator, encyclopaedist (&quot;Encyclopédie française&quot;), political figure and scholar. His father was a tax collector in Bazas, Gironde where Anatole – a name he disliked from an early age – was born in 1876. A nurse mishap resulted in an accident where the infant Anatole lost the proper use of his leg and he remained crippled for the rest of his life. He never married but had several relationships. A brilliant mind, he studied in Agen before attending the Collège Stanislas, a famous Roman Catholic school in Paris, where he became friend with writer to be Henry de Jouvenel and Roman Catholic activist Marc Sangnier.

==Career==
He studied law and started to practice but finally chose politics. He was chef de cabinet of education minister Joseph Chautemps in 1902. At about the same time, he started a career as a local politician in the Lot, a forlorn and backwater, yet charming, department in the south west of France. Successively, and very often simultaneously, he became counsellor, general, mayor of Cahors (the local prefecture), deputy and senator. Soon commanding a huge following among the local voters, pleased by his culture, his easy access to government and proficiency in handing out public sector jobs, he made of the Lot a lifelong stronghold.

Member of a small centrist faction, called &quot;Républicains Socialistes&quot;, he soon cut a fine figure in the Chambre des Députés because of its abilities and its central positioning. His thriving ministerial career started in 1913 when he was appointed &quot;sous-secrétaire d&#x27;État à la marine marchande&quot;. From 1918 to 1940, he occupied numerous positions in all sorts of governments and was appointed minister eighteen times. 
As a finance minister, he is remembered for recommending to cut the budget in 1925. He was deeply involved in diplomatic affairs, starting a campaign for a renewal of the relations with the Holy See followed, in 1922, by a plea for the acknowledgment of the Soviet Union.
From 1924 to 1927, he headed the Russian Affairs Commission and as such dealt with some of the prominent Russian figures of that time. He started discussing the reimbursement of the Russian loans but, after the return to power of Poincaré in 1926, the negotiation failed.
In 1925, he also served briefly as Minister of Education and Fine Arts. He is credited for introducing philosophy in the high school curriculum, perhaps a reflect of his masonic affiliation. He also banned the teaching of local dialects or languages in school – for instance, declaring in 1927 that &quot;for the linguistic unity of France, the Breton language must disappear&quot;. During a new stint as Minister of Education in the government of Édouard Herriot in 1932, the name of the department was changed to &quot;Éducation nationale&quot;, a name it has kept hitherto. His policy generally promoted a free and neutral education system.

Minister of &quot;Travaux publics&quot; in 1938, he was confronted to a great dockers strike, which enhanced the Left distrust for his person. Between 1938 and 1940, he led several diplomatic missions. During that time of international tensions, Anatole&#x27;s position was a matter of controversy. A stalwart pacifist, he was indeed actively promoting a Latin alliance between France and Italy who would mediate between Hitler and the Allies.

On 10 July 1940, he voted in favour of granting the cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. Being a friend of Otto Abetz, Darquier de Pellepoix and Fernand de Brinon, he was nonetheless an object of hatred for many among the Vichy regime. He was forced to resign from his mayorship in 1942. Indicted by the &quot;Comité national des écrivains&quot; (National Writers&#x27; Committee) in 1945, he died in Paris two years later.

Anatole de Monzie was a scholar and something of a writer. His intellectual legacy numbers the publication of the Encyclopédie française from 1935 on. He was also connected to various French writers and intellectuals of the time, including Colette, Roland Dorgelès, Lucien Febvre and Pierre Benoit, whom he introduced to the Lot, especially the little town of Saint-Céré, where the writer wrote several of his works. Despite his achievements, however, his legacy will be forever tainted by his opposition to Breton culture.

<text>Daniel James Moody Jr. (June 1, 1893May 22, 1966), was an American lawyer and Democratic politician. Originally from Taylor, Texas, he served as the 30th governor of Texas between 1927 and 1931. At the age of 33, he was elected. He took office as the youngest governor in Texas history. After his 2 terms as governor, he returned to private law practice. He continued to prosecute and represent various functions of the US government later in life.

==Early life==
Moody was born on June 1, 1893, in Taylor, Texas. He was the son of Taylor&#x27;s mayor, justice of the peace, and school board chairman, Daniel James Moody, who was one of the town&#x27;s first settlers in 1876. His mother, Nannie Elizabeth Robertson, was a local schoolteacher when Moody married her in 1890. Moody Jr. was an alumnus of the University of Texas Law School and became a member of the State Bar of Texas at 21, in 1914. He began practicing with Harris Melasky in Taylor. During World War I, Moody served in both the Texas National Guard as first a 2nd Lieutenant and then Captain and also in the United States Army as a 2nd Lieutenant.

==Public service==
In 1920, Moody served as Williamson County Attorney, a position he held for two years before becoming District Attorney in 1922. In 1923, Moody obtained an assault conviction against four members of the Ku Klux Klan for beating and tarring a white traveling salesman. The Texas Historical Commission wrote, &quot;These trials were considered the first prosecutorial success in the United States against the 1920s Klan and quickly weakened the Klan&#x27;s political influence in Texas.&quot; The Klan was very powerful in Texas, with an estimated 150,000 members in the state, including the national imperial wizard. Texas Klansmen included a US senator and Dallas, Fort Worth, and Wichita Falls mayors. The case was widely reported and gave him political momentum despite Klan opposition.

After his election as Texas Attorney General in 1925, Moody conducted investigations of the highly-corrupt James E. Ferguson, whose wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, was serving as the governor of Texas. His investigation recovered $1 million for the taxpayers of Texas. In 1927, Moody defeated her in a runoff election and became the youngest governor of Texas. Suffragists&#x27; activism provided a major contribution to her defeat, as they rallied behind Moody and campaigned for him. The activist Jane Y. McCallum, whom Moody would later appoint as his Secretary of State, hosted the campaign headquarters in her own home. She and her colleagues hired a secretary, and they sent &quot;letters, editorials, and pamphlets&quot; to Texas women to ask them to vote for Moody.

A conservative Democrat, he served two terms as governor before he left public office. He opposed the nomination of &quot;wet,&quot; Catholic Al Smith in the 1928 presidential primaries, but unlike the Fergusons, he supported Smith against Herbert Hoover in the general election, which saw Texas vote Republican for the first time in its history. Moody supported a reform program of state prisons, roads, and auditing system. In the 1930s, he became a staunch critic of US President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.

==Later life==
In 1931, Moody resumed private law practice in Austin, Texas, after his last term as governor. A request from President Roosevelt made Moody help to prosecute income tax evasion schemes in Louisiana as a special assistant to the US Attorney General. Moody continued to represent Texas and its executives throughout the 1930s. He entered politics for the last time in 1942 for a Texas seat in the US Senate. Moody came in third in the 1942 Democratic primary for the seat, his only political defeat, behind former Governors W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel and James V. Allred. The election was won by O&#x27;Daniel. Moody represented Coke R. Stevenson in his case against Lyndon B. Johnson over the hotly-contested 1948 Democratic senatorial primary electoral dispute, and Allred represented Johnson. In the 1950s, despite remaining a Democrat, Moody endorsed the Republican Dwight Eisenhower for president in 1952 and 1956. Moody endorsed the Republican Richard Nixon for president in 1960. He and his wife spent their remaining years in Austin. He died in 1966 and was buried at the Texas State Cemetery.

==Personal life==
On April 20, 1926, he married Mildred Paxton of Abilene, Texas. The couple had two children, Daniel III and Nancy.

==Legacy==

The Williamson County Courthouse had the courtroom in which Moody tried his famous case against the Klan completely restored to its 1920s appearance and reopened in 2007. It is free and open to the public in Georgetown, Texas. There is also a statue of Moody installed outside the courthouse.

<text>Visual Objects is an object-oriented computer programming language that is used to create computer programs that operate primarily under Windows. Although it can be used as a general-purpose programming tool, it is almost exclusively used to create database programs.

The original Visual Objects project (code-named Aspen) was started as part of Nantucket&#x27;s attempts to bring the Clipper language to Windows, and move from the procedural to the object-oriented style. It also converted Clipper from a p-code system to being a true native compiler and introduced more elements of the C language (such as typed variables), while including Windows extensions (such as COM, ODBC, and later ADO). With its symbol datatype, it offers the ability to form name-based linkages, which may be used to connect menu events to object methods or form direct linkages between server columns and controls.

The Windows version was finally brought to market by Computer Associates. Unfortunately it was released before it was market-ready and in almost head-to-head competition with the first release of the Borland Delphi product. The language is still in use however the last release by GrafX Software was in 2012 of version 2.8 sp4 (version number 2838). GrafX announced that after this no new versions would be released. The next incarnation of the Visual Objects language is Vulcan.NET, written by GrafX from scratch to be both Visual Objects compatible and be a true CLS compliant .NET language, taking full advantage of the .NET framework.

<text>John Moody (May 2, 1868 – February 16, 1958) was an American financial analyst, businessman and investor. He pioneered the rating of bonds and founded Moody&#x27;s Investors Service. Moody&#x27;s ratings are still issued, carrying on the tradition begun by &quot;Moody&#x27;s Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities&quot; and continued by the annual &quot;Moody&#x27;s Analyses of Investments&quot;.

He resided in Cranford, New Jersey from 1893 to 1913.

==Moody and bond rating==
Moody&#x27;s was later merged into Dun &amp; Bradstreet, only to again become an independent corporation in October 2000. Moody&#x27;s status is reflected in Thomas Friedman&#x27;s 1996 comment: that&quot;There are two superpowers in the world today in my opinion. There&#x27;s the United States and there&#x27;s Moody&#x27;s Bond Rating Service. The United States can destroy you by dropping bombs, and Moody&#x27;s can destroy you by downgrading your bonds. And believe me, it&#x27;s not clear sometimes who&#x27;s more powerful.&quot; (February 13, 1996 interview with Jim Lehrer)

In 2007, Moody&#x27;s Corporation was split into two operating divisions, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, the rating agency, and Moody&#x27;s Analytics, with all of its other services.

==Honors==
Moody was a convert to Roman Catholicism after being raised a self-described Low Church Protestant Episcopalian, then a Broad Church Episcopalian. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Boston College, and was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem by Pope Pius XI.

==Family==
Moody was the son of William Francis Moody (1834–1919) and his wife Sarah Jane, née Nichols (1839–1897). He was one of five children. He was married to Anna Mulford Addison (1877, Nice, France – 1965); their sons were UCLA philosopher and medievalist, Ernest Addison Moody (1903–1975) and John Edmund Moody (1900–1926), who died of typhoid fever in Messina, Sicily.

<text>Paul Moody (May 23, 1779 – July 5, 1831) was a U.S. textile machinery inventor born in Byfield, Massachusetts (Town of Newbury). He is often credited with developing and perfecting the first power loom in America, which launched the first successful integrated cotton mill at Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1814, under the leadership of Francis Cabot Lowell and his associates.

==Early life==
Paul Moody was born May 24, 1779, at Byfield, Massachusetts, the son of Paul Moody and one of nine children.

Although Moody&#x27;s academic education was limited, at age sixteen he learned the weaver&#x27;s craft, and soon became an expert. He later went to work at a nail factory of Jacob Perkins, first in Byfield and later in Amesbury, Massachusetts, when the company moved. In 1812 he worked for Kendrick and Worthen, makers of carding machinery.

On July 13, 1800 (one source says September 1798), he married Susan Morrill of Amesbury. The couple went on to have three sons.

Soon after his marriage, he partnered with Ezra Worthen, Thomas Boardman and Samuel Wigglesworth to form the Amesbury Wool and Cotton Manufacturing Company. It was incorporated on February 16, 1813.

==Waltham==
In 1814 he arrived at Waltham, Massachusetts, to supervise the setting up of machinery for a new cotton mill under Francis Cabot Lowell and The Boston Associates. Moody created the first power loom that harnessed the city&#x27;s streams, canals, and rivers. The patent for the loom went to Lowell and his partner.

During his time in Waltham, Moody was awarded other patents. This included one in 1816 for what would eventually become the filling frame (the invited item completed in 1819). He improved upon the &quot;double speeder&quot;, a device for roping cotton and got the patent on April 3, 1819. On January 17, 1818, he improved upon the soapstone rollers for Horrocks&#x27; dressing machine thereby doubling its efficacy.

Moody Street in downtown Waltham is named after Paul Moody.

==Lowell==
With the success of Waltham, The Boston Associates established an entirely new city in 1821-1825 along the banks of the Merrimack River in East Chelmsford. The city became Lowell, named after Francis Cabott Lowell. There, in 1824, Moody built Lowell Machine Works, to supply the mills with their machines.

In 1824 Moody developed a system of leather belting and pulleys to power machinery, which was almost exclusively used in American mills from then on. The new mode of power transmission was more economical and required less maintenance than the shaft-and-gear system used in the British mills. See: Line shaft

From 1823-5 Moody was the chief engineer for the Locks and Canals Company. During that time he lived in the house now known as the Moody-Whister-Francis House (currently housing the Whistler House Museum of Art).

Moody suddenly died in Lowell in 1831 after a 3-day illness. He was later honored by having streets in Waltham and Lowell, Massachusetts, named after him, although sections of the one in Lowell were later renamed University Avenue and Textile Avenue, as it continues into neighboring Dracut, Massachusetts.

<text>Wetwork () is a euphemism for murder or assassination that alludes to spilling blood. The expression and the similar &quot;wet job&quot;, &quot;wet affair&quot;, or &quot;wet operation&quot; are all calques of Russian terms for such activities and can be traced to criminal slang from at least the 19th century and originally meant robbery that involved murder or the spilling of blood.

The operations are reputed to have been handled by the CIA and by the KGB&#x27;s SpecBureau 13 (Spets Byuro 13), known as the &quot;Department of Wet Affairs&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

<doc id="837652" wikidata="Q1587710" url="?curid=837652" title="Sage thrasher">
<text>The sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus) is a medium-sized passerine bird from the family Mimidae, which also includes mockingbirds, tremblers, and New World catbirds. It is the only member of the genus Oreoscoptes. This seems less close to the Caribbean thrashers, but rather to the mockingbirds instead (Hunt &quot;et al.&quot; 2001, Barber &quot;et al.&quot; 2004).

== Description ==

&quot;Oreoscoptes montanus&quot; are pale grey-brown on the upperparts and white with dark streaks on the underparts. They have a slim straight relatively short bill, yellow eyes and a long tail, although not as long as that of other thrashers.

Measurements:

* Length: 7.9-9.1 in (20-23 cm)
* Weight: 1.4-1.8 oz (40-50 g)
* Wingspan: 12.6 in (32 cm)

== Breeding ==
As its name suggests, this bird breeds in western North America, from southern Canada to northern Arizona and New Mexico. Its breeding habitat is in areas with dense stands of sagebrush and rarely in other shrubby areas. Their nests are made of twigs, rootlets and bark strips, lined with fine rootlets. The female lays 4 or 5 eggs in a twiggy cup nest built in a low bush. Both parents incubate and feed the young birds.

== Migrating ==
In winter, these birds migrate to the southernmost United States and Mexico, including the Baja Peninsula, north and south.

== Diet ==
They mainly eat insects in summer; they also eat berries, especially in winter. They usually search for insects on the ground in brushy locations.

== Vocalization ==
The male bird sings a series of warbled notes to defend his nesting territory.

== Conservation ==
These birds have declined in some areas where sagebrush has been removed but are still common where suitable habitat remains. The continued decline of sagebrush habitats in western North America is cause for alarm for this and other sagebrush dependent species.

<doc id="837669" wikidata="Q5149659" url="?curid=837669" title="Columbia College (South Carolina)">
<text>Columbia College is a private college in Columbia, South Carolina, United States. Founded in 1854 by the United Methodist Church as a women&#x27;s liberal arts college, Columbia College became fully coeducational in 2020 welcoming its first coed residential class in fall 2021. It also offers evening, graduate, and online programs for women and men.

==History==

Founded in 1854, Columbia Female College officially opened in 1859 with an initial student body of 121 and a faculty of 16. When General Sherman and his troops marched through Columbia in 1865, the school had to close. It was saved from being torched only because Professor of Music W. H. Orchard, having heard that all unoccupied buildings would be burned by a certain hour, left his home to stand in the doorway of the college where he could be seen by the troops. The school was reopened in 1873. The college was damaged by its first fire in 1895, though the damage was not extensive. The name changed to Columbia College in 1905 after it was moved to its present site in North Columbia in 1904. Swept by a second fire in 1909, the college operated out of its former Plain Street facilities until the North Columbia campus could be reoccupied in 1910.

From 1940 to 1951, presidents Guilds and Greene oversaw Columbia College as well as Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

In 1964, a third fire ravaged the campus, destroying Old Main, a college landmark. Frightened and disheartened students, huddled in the middle of the night in College Place Methodist Church, were told by President Spears, &quot;Nothing has been destroyed that cannot be rebuilt.&quot; Soon thereafter new interest in the college was engendered, and building continued. The columns of Old Main, which had been the only thing left standing in the ashes when the fire was over, became a symbol of Columbia College, its strength and its endurance.

Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe taught art at Columbia College in 1914 and 1915.

During the 1980s, an evening college was established in which both female and male students could be educated. In 2024 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; has ranked Columbia College No. 33 out of 136 regional colleges in the South.

In 2011, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) named Columbia College professor, Dr. John Zubizarreta &quot;U.S. Professor of the Year&quot; for undergraduate baccalaureate colleges. Zubizarreta is a professor of English and director of honors and faculty development for Columbia College. The Columbia College honors program has also produced two consecutive National Collegiate Honors Council Honor Students of the Year, Homa Hassan in 2009 and Diana Lynde in 2010.

On Jan. 31, 2020 the board of trustees voted for the plan to admit men to the college&#x27;s residential day program. This is a significant change for Columbia College, which was founded in 1854 as Columbia Female College. This will not be the first time a man has studied at the college as male students have previously participated in co-ed evening, graduate and online programs, but this will be the first time men can study in a “co-ed residential day program.
Columbia College stated it made the change to enroll men as a result of “shifts in student demographics, cultural shifts and population trends.”

==Athletics==
The Columbia College athletic teams are called the Koalas. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Appalachian Athletic Conference (AAC) since the 2011–12 academic year. The Koalas previously competed in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC; formerly known as Georgia–Alabama–Carolina Conference (GACC) until after the 2003–04 school year) from 2005–06 to 2010–11; and in the defunct Eastern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (EIAC) during the 2004–05 school year.

Columbia College competes in 15 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Men&#x27;s sports debuted when the college became co-educational in 2020, beginning athletic competition in the 2021 fall season.

Alongside the addition of men&#x27;s sports, Columbia College added Esports as a program within the institution. This includes Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rocket League, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

<doc id="837699" wikidata="Q724503" url="?curid=837699" title="William Henry Moody">
<text>William Henry Moody (December 23, 1853 – July 2, 1917) was an American politician and jurist who held positions in all three branches of the Government of the United States. He represented parts of Essex County, Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives from 1895 until 1902. He then served in the cabinet of President Theodore Roosevelt as Secretary of the Navy and Attorney General before Roosevelt appointed him to the United States Supreme Court in 1906. He retired from the Court for health reasons after a brief tenure of just less than four years. A progressive like Roosevelt, he opposed racial segregation and spoke out in favor of African-American civil rights.

==Early life and education==
Moody was born in Newbury, Massachusetts, the son of Henry Lord Moody and Melissa Augusta (Emerson) Moody. His father owned and managed several farms, and Moody attended the local schools of Newbury, Salem, and Danvers. All of his immigrant ancestors came to Massachusetts from England, and they all came as part of the Puritan migration from England. All of them arrived between 1620 and 1640. He graduated from Phillips Academy in 1872 and Harvard University, Phi Beta Kappa in 1876. After four months attending Harvard Law School, he began to study law in the office of Richard Henry Dana Jr., and attained admission to the Massachusetts bar in 1878.

==Start of career==
Early in his legal career, Moody first was elected city solicitor of Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1888. After appointment as the District Attorney for Eastern Massachusetts in 1890, he gained widespread notoriety in 1893 as the junior prosecutor in the Lizzie Borden murder case. While his efforts were unsuccessful he was generally acknowledged as the most competent and effective of the attorneys on either side.

==U.S. Congress==
He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts, and served from 1895 to 1902. He served on the powerful Appropriations Committee, and also held seats on Insular Affairs, Expenditures in the Department of Justice, and the Joint Commission on the Transportation of the Mails. He was a candidate to succeed Thomas B. Reed as Speaker in 1899, but the post was won by David B. Henderson.

==Secretary of the Navy==
During President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s administration, Moody served as the Secretary of Navy from 1902 to 1904. He oversaw the start of the Roosevelt-era expansion of the Navy, including an increase in the number of ships, as well as an effort to increase manpower by improving efforts to recruit sailors from non-coastal states. Moody also negotiated with the government of Cuba for the original lease that permitted construction and occupation of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.

==U.S. Attorney General==
Moody served as Attorney General from 1904 to 1906. In this post, Moody actively followed Roosevelt&#x27;s trust-busting policies, negotiating with &#x27;good&#x27; trusts such as U.S. Steel but successfully prosecuting &#x27;bad&#x27; ones such as Standard Oil and the Beef Trust. After the Lynching of Paul Reed and Will Cato, Moody refused to grant permission for an indictment, believing no federal right had been violated.

==U.S. Supreme Court==
Roosevelt nominated Moody as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on December 3, 1906, to a seat vacated by Henry B. Brown. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 12, 1906, and was sworn into office on December 17, 1906.

Moody&#x27;s service on the Court was brief but eventful, and he authored 67 opinions and five dissents. His most noted opinion was in the minority in the &quot;Employers Liability Cases&quot; (1908), where he held that Congress&#x27; power to regulate interstate commerce included the ability to legislate management&#x27;s relationship with employees. While he generally supported enhanced federal powers, opinions such as &quot;Twining v. New Jersey&quot; (1908), where he held that the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s protection against compulsory self-incrimination did not apply to cases presented in state courts, made him hard to pigeonhole. He also wrote for a unanimous Court in the famous case of &quot;Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co. v. Mottley&quot;, which limited federal question jurisdiction to cases in which the plaintiff&#x27;s cause of action was based on federal law.

By 1908, Moody suffered severe rheumatism. This affected Moody to such an extent that his last sitting on the bench was May 7, 1909, when he left for a brief rest and never returned. With the age- and health-enfeebled Supreme Court of 1909 crippled (President William Howard Taft was to make a record-setting five appointments due to death and resignations over the course of a single year in 1910–1911), Taft urged Moody, then the youngest justice at 55, to step down. After Taft successfully lobbied Congress for a Special Act granting Moody full retirement benefits (to which he would not otherwise have qualified for), Moody retired from the Court on November 20, 1910.

==Death and burial==
Moody was not married, and had no children. He died in Haverhill, Massachusetts on July 2, 1917, at age 63, and was buried at Byfield Cemetery in Georgetown, Massachusetts.

==Awards and honors==
In 1904, Moody received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Tufts University and Amherst College.

==Legacy==
After Moody&#x27;s death, some of his official papers were placed in the custody of Professor Felix Frankfurter, then of Harvard Law School. They are now in the collection of Frankfurter&#x27;s papers in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress.
Moody&#x27;s office furnishings and papers were donated to the Haverhill Historical Society and there is a Moody Room open to the public at the Buttonwoods Museum in Haverhill that features his personal collection.

USS &quot;Moody&quot; (DD-277) was named for him.

In 2018, television and film actor Jay Huguley portrayed Moody in &quot;Lizzie&quot;, a biographical thriller film about Lizzie Borden.

The documentary opens with black and white footage from an Irving Klaw film depicting models, including Bettie Page, wearing fetish attire. Nick Broomfield and his film crew then arrive at Pandora&#x27;s Box on Manhattan&#x27;s Fifth Avenue and are given a tour of the facility by Mistress Raven, including the dungeon and the medical room. The rest of the documentary consists of the following eight chapters:
*Slaves
*Mistresses
*Rubber fetish
*Wrestling fetish
*Corporal punishment
*Masochism
*Infantilism
*Socio-political fetishes

The film was produced in the United Kingdom and was originally made for HBO.

<text>William Vaughn Moody (July 8, 1869 – October 17, 1910) was an American dramatist and poet. Moody was author of &quot;The Great Divide&quot;, first presented under the title of &quot;The Sabine Woman&quot; at the Garrick Theatre in Chicago on April 12, 1906, and then on Broadway at the Princess Theatre, running for 238 performances from October 3, 1906, to March 24, 1907. His poetic dramas are &quot;The Masque of Judgment&quot; (1900), &quot;The Fire Bringer&quot; (1904), and &quot;The Death of Eve&quot; (left undone at his death). His best-known poem is &quot;An Ode in Time of Hesitation,&quot; on the Spanish-American War; others include &quot;Gloucester Moor,&quot; &quot;On a Soldier Fallen in the Philippines,&quot; &quot;The Brute,&quot; &quot;Harmonics&quot; (his only sonnet), &quot;Until the Troubling of the Waters,&quot; &quot;The Departure,&quot; &quot;How the Mead-Slave Was Set Free,&quot; &quot;The Daguerreotype,&quot; and &quot;The Death of Eve.&quot; His poems everywhere bespeak the social conscience of the progressive era (1893–1916) in which he spent his foreshortened life. In style they evoke a mastery of the verse-craft of his time and also the reach and depth derived from his intensive studies of Milton and of Greek tragedy.

==Biography==
Born at Spencer, Indiana, his parents died while he was a boy, and he had to work to help support himself while he completed his education. After attending New Albany High School he went on to Harvard University, where he was awarded the George B. Sohier Prize for literature and earned an A.B. in 1893 and an A.M. in 1894.

He was a classmate of W. E. B. Du Bois, who quoted from his play &quot;The Fire-Bringer&quot; in a speech in honor of Carter G. Woodson.

He taught English at Harvard and Radcliffe until 1895, when he became first an instructor at the University of Chicago and then, from 1901 to 1907, assistant professor of English and rhetoric there. He received the degree of Litt.D. from Yale in 1908, and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his close friends were the historian Ferdinand Schevill, the editor Norman Hapgood, the author, academic, activist and diplomat Robert Morss Lovett, and the poet Trumbull Stickney. After a time he resigned his teaching post at the University of Chicago, commenting (as his friend John Matthews Manly quotes him in the introduction to the posthumous collection of his works), &quot;I cannot do it; I feel that at every lecture I slay a poet.&quot;

Moody died from brain cancer at Colorado Springs at the age of 41.

==Works==
* &quot;The Complete Poetical Works of John Milton&quot; (editor; 1899, Cambridge)
* &quot;The Masque of Judgment&quot; (1900)
* &quot;Poems&quot; (1901)

<doc id="837723" wikidata="Q1383895" url="?curid=837723" title="Hubertus van Mook">
<text>Hubertus Johannes &quot;Huib&quot; van Mook (30 May 1894 – 10 May 1965) was a Dutch administrator in the East Indies. During the Indonesian National Revolution, he served as the lieutenant governor-general of the Dutch East Indies from 1942 to 1948. Van Mook also had a son named Cornelius van Mook who studied marine engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also wrote about Java - and his work on Kota Gede is a good example of a colonial bureaucrat capable of examining and writing about local folklore.

==Biography==
Hubertus van Mook was born in Semarang in Central Java on 30 May 1894. As with many Dutch and Indos (people of European and Indonesian heritage) growing up in the East Indies, he came to regard the colony, particularly Java, as his home. He studied Indology at Leiden University, and then returned to the Dutch East Indies. In 1931, he became a member of the &quot;Volksraad&quot;, the advisory body set up by the colonial administration. There he spoke in favour of greater autonomy for the Dutch East Indies and for equal treatment for different races. From 1937 to 1941 he was director of economic affairs. On 29 December 1941, a royal decree named Van Mook the successor to Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Alidius Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer, and appointed him lieutenant governor-general. Immediately prior to the surrender of the East Indies to the Japanese on 8 March 1942, the Dutch East Indies government in exile near Brisbane, Australia gave Van Mook authority over those areas still unoccupied by the Japanese. However, two weeks later, he was relieved of his lieutenant-governorship and became minister of colonial affairs. On 14 September 1944, after he persuaded the Dutch government in exile to establish a provisional East Indies government, he was reappointed lieutenant governor-general. Due to his liberal inclinations and sympathies towards Indonesian nationalism, many conservative Dutch distrusted his policies and he was never given the full title of governor-general. Because of the weakened position of the Dutch due to the Nazi invasion and occupation, much of the task of retaking the East Indies following the Japanese surrender in August 1945 was carried out by Australian and British forces. While Australian forces succeeded in occupying the Outer Islands with minimal resistance, British forces in Java and Sumatra were challenged by a nascent Indonesian republic led by Sukarno and Hatta.
On 1 October 1945, Van Mook arrived back in Java along with elements of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration. However, their presence generated much outrage from much of the Indonesian populace who were opposed to the restoration of Dutch colonial rule. With Dutch support being limited to Christian areas like Ambon and Manado, which were at that time (not before WWII) the chief sources of recruitment for the Royal Dutch East Indies Army., even though the majority of Royal Dutch East Indies Army soldiers had always been Javanese Muslims, the largest ethnic group in the colony. Republican forces had taken control of Manado by February 1946, before being subdued by allied forces, and many Christian Manado and Ambonesse supported the Republic, including chief representative for the UN, Lambertus Nicodemus Palar, Leimena, Alexander Andries Maramis. On the other hand, many leading Dutch supporters were from Muslim areas, including Sultan Hamid II, Andi Azis, R. Abdulkadir Wijoyoatmojo (later chief Dutch negotiator in the talks leading to the Renville Agreement). While van Mook planned to grant independence to Indonesia, he advocated a federal Republic of the United States of Indonesia with strong political and economic ties to the Netherlands. He regarded Sukarno&#x27;s republic as economically inept and unable to ward off the Indonesian Chinese, Indonesian Indians, and the rising Indonesian Communist Party, and began cultivating links with Indonesian leaders outside Java, particularly in West Java and eastern Indonesia. He organised a number of conferences aimed at offsetting the influence of the republic.

The above factors and violations of the Linggadjati Agreement prompted the East Indies government to launch a police action in mid-1947, which was known as Operation Product. The KNIL and Royal Netherlands Army occupied large areas of Java and Sumatra, with the Republican army offering only weak resistance. However, the Dutch were held back from full conquest of the Republic by pressure from the UN Security Council and the United States, which called for a ceasefire. This led to the announcement of a ceasefire in January 1948 followed by a formal armistice. As a consequence, a conflict previously considered to be an internal Dutch affair now took on an international dimension.

The Renville Agreement, as the armistice was called, stipulated the withdrawal of Indonesian forces from Dutch-occupied territory and the establishment of a ceasefire boundary known as the Van Mook Line. Because of problems caused by the differing interests of regional leaders and opposition from elements of the Dutch military and government, in 1948 Van Mook resigned. Meanwhile, some time after the ceasefire, the Indonesian military secretly returned and began guerrilla operations against the Dutch. This led to a second major Dutch police action known as Operation Kraai in December 1948.

Van Mook subsequently broke links with both Indonesia and his home country, and took a job with the United Nations. However, not long after this, he died in France.

<text>Edward Aloysius Mooney (May 9, 1882 – October 25, 1958) was an American Catholic prelate who Archbishop of Detroit from 1937 until his death in 1958. He was made a cardinal in 1946. He previously served as an apostolic delegate to India and later Japan and was Bishop of Rochester from 1933 to 1937.

==Early life ==
Edward Mooney was born on May 9, 1882, in Mount Savage, Maryland, the seventh child of Thomas and Sarah (née Heneghan) Mooney. When he was five years old, the family moved to Youngstown, Ohio, where Thomas Mooney worked at a tube mill. Following his father&#x27;s death in the 1890s, Sarah Mooney opened a small bakery to support the family, with Edward Mooney and his siblings delivering the baked goods to her customers. 

Having decided to become a priest, Mooney first attended St. Charles College, a minor seminary in Ellicott City, Maryland. He then entered St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary, the major seminary in Baltimore. Mooney was sent to Rome in 1905 to study, residing at the Pontifical North American College. 

== Priesthood ==
Mooney was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Cleveland by Cardinal Pietro Respighi in Rome on April 10, 1909.

After Mooney returned to the United States, the diocese assigned him to teach dogmatic theology at St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary, the minor seminary in Wickliffe, Ohio. In 1916, he was named as the founding principal of the Cathedral Latin School in Cleveland. Mooney left Cathedral in 1922 to serve as pastor of St. Patrick Parish in Youngstown, Ohio.

Mooney returned to Rome in 1923 to serve as spiritual director of the North American College. Cardinal Albert Meyer, an alumnus of the College, once remarked, &quot;[Mooney] was revered and greatly beloved ... he left an indelible mark on all the students, inspiring them with his great learning and his solid spiritual guidance.&quot; The Vatican raised Mooney to the rank of domestic prelate of his holiness in 1925.

==Episcopal career==

===Apostolic delegate===

==== East Indies ====
On January 21, 1926, after having made a favorable impression on Cardinal Gasparri, Mooney was appointed apostolic delegate to the East Indies and titular archbishop of Irenopolis in Isauria by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration at the chapel of the North American College on January 31, 1926. Cardinal Willem van Rossum was the principal consecrator, with Archbishop Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani and Bishop Giulio Serafini serving as co-consecrators. 

As apostolic delegate, Mooney was headquartered in Bangalore, then part of the princely state of Mysore. He founded 15 missions and three dioceses in British India and negotiated a reconciliation between the Vatican and the Syro-Malankara Church there.

==== Japan ====
Mooney was named apostolic delegate to Japan by Pius XI on March 30, 1931. During this period, the Japanese government forced all Japanese citizens to visit and pay homage at Shinto shrines. However, Catholics objected to being forced to participate in Shinto religious ceremonies. Mooney helped convince the government to declare that visits to the shrine were of a non-sectarian patriotic nature. He later presided over a plenary council of Korean bishops.

===Bishop of Rochester===
On August 28, 1933, Pius XI appointed Mooney as bishop of Rochester, with the personal title of &quot;archbishop&quot;. During his tenure in Rochester, he promoted Catholic Action and the Knights of Peter Claver as a means of outreach to the African American community, and took deep interest in Catholic social teaching and labor relations. 

Mooney was elected chair in 1935 of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, maintaining that post until 1945.

===Archbishop of Detroit===
Mooney was named the first archbishop of Detroit on May 31, 1937. Arriving by train in Detroit on August 2nd, he was greeted by Michigan Governor Frank Murphy and a representative of Detroit Mayor Frank Couzens, along with a large crowd. 

Mooney soon became engaged in a contentious relationship with Reverend Charles Coughlin, a priest in the archdiocese. A popular radio broadcaster who reached millions of listeners across the country, Father Coughlin&#x27;s antisemitic tirades and fierce attacks against US President Franklin Roosevelt angered many in the Catholic hierarchy and American public. In October 1937, Mooney publicly rebuked Coughlin for calling Roosevelt stupid over his nomination of Senator Hugo Black to the US Supreme Court. This reprimand from Mooney led Coughlin to cancel his contract for 26 radio broadcasts. In a January 1939 meeting of all the archdiocesan priests, Mooney proposed the establishment of labor schools in the parishes to help &quot;Christian workers to train themselves in principle and technique to assume the leadership in the unions which their numbers justify&quot;. 

An avid golf player, Mooney once remarked to his priests &quot;If your score is over 100, you are neglecting your golf—if it falls below 90, you&#x27;re neglecting your parish&quot;. Every year, he would take a group of altar boys to the opening game of the baseball season.

During World War II, Mooney staunchly opposed Nazi Germany and its fascist allies. In an August 1942 meeting in Washington D.C. of North and South American prelates, he warned, &quot;A victory in this war for the forces of Nazi-inspired aggression would drive Christians underground for generations in the conquered countries.&quot; 

In 1942, the US Department of Justice was planning to indict Coughlin on charges of sedition. As part of a deal to avoid Coughlin&#x27;s prosecution, Mooney ordered him to end his political activities and work solely as a parish priest. Commenting on his order, Mooney stated, &quot;My understanding with him is sufficiently broad and firm to exclude effectively the recurrence of any such unpleasant situation.&quot;Pope Pius XII created Mooney as cardinal priest of the Church of Santa Susanna in Rome during the consistory of February 18, 1946.

As the northern suburbs of Detroit grew after World War II ended in 1945, Mooney added churches in the remote areas of Oakland County. In 1948, he appointed Reverend Frederick Delaney to begin opening additional parishes in the rural areas of the county. In 1957, Mooney delivered the benediction in Washington at the second term inauguration ceremony of US President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

== Death and legacy ==
Mooney died in Rome on October 25, 1958, at age 76, after suffering from a heart attack and collapsing less than three hours before the beginning of the 1958 papal conclave. Cardinals Francis Spellman and James McIntyre rushed to his deathbed to grant him absolution. 

Mooney was initially buried in the crypt of St. John&#x27;s Provincial Seminary in Plymouth, Michigan, but his remains were transferred in 1988 to Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan. Several schools have been named after Mooney:

* Cardinal Mooney High School in Youngstown, Ohio, founded in 1956
* Cardinal Mooney High School in Greece, New York, founded in 1962, closed in 1989
* Cardinal Mooney High School in Sarasota, Florida, founded in 1959
* Cardinal Mooney High School in Marine City, Michigan, founded in 1977

<text>Thomas Joseph Mooney (December 8, 1882 – March 6, 1942) was an American political activist and labor leader, who was convicted with Warren K. Billings of the San Francisco Preparedness Day Bombing of 1916. It quickly became apparent that Mooney and Billings had been convicted based on falsified evidence and perjured testimony; and the Mooney case and campaigns to free him became an international cause célèbre for two decades, with a substantial number of publications demonstrating the falsity of the conviction. These publications and the facts of the case are surveyed in Richard H. Frost, The Mooney Case (Stanford University Press, 1968). Mooney served 22 years in prison before finally being pardoned in 1939.

==Early life==
The son of Irish immigrants, Mooney was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 8, 1882. His father, Bernard, had been a coal miner and a militant organizer for the Knights of Labor in struggles so intense that after one fight he was left for dead. Bernard Mooney died of &quot;miner&#x27;s con&quot; (now known as silicosis) at the age of 36, when Tom, the eldest of three surviving children, was ten years old. Tom&#x27;s sister Anna told neighbors that the family had originated in Holyoke, Massachusetts, not Chicago.

Thomas held many jobs as an industrial worker before developing a career as a labor leader and socialist activist. As a young man, Mooney toured Europe, where he learned about socialism. After arriving in California, he met his wife Rena, and found a place in the Socialist Party of America and the presidential campaign of Eugene V. Debs. Mooney also became a member of the militant industrial union the Industrial Workers of the World. In 1910, Mooney won a trip to the Second International Conference in Copenhagen by selling a huge number of subscriptions to the socialist &quot;Wilshire Magazine&quot;. On his way home, he visited the British Trades Union Congress in Sheffield, England. 

==Preparedness Day Bombing==
Ten deaths and forty injuries resulted from the explosion in the midst of the Preparedness Day parade. The bombing took place at the height of anarchist violence in the United States, especially the &quot;Galleanist&quot; anarcho-communist movement of Luigi Galleani.

==Trial==
Mooney and Billings were convicted in separate trials and Mooney was sentenced to be hanged and Billings got a life sentence. Rena Mooney and Weinberg were acquitted.

==In prison==

In 1918, Mooney&#x27;s sentence was changed to life imprisonment, the same as Billings. Mooney quickly became one of the most famous political prisoners in America. A worldwide campaign to free Tom Mooney followed. During that time his wife Rena, &quot;Bulletin&quot; editor Fremont Older, anarchists Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman, Lucy Robins Lang, heiress Aline Barnsdall, Hollywood celebrities, international politicians, and many other well-known people campaigned for his release. Caroline Decker, a labor activist who later became active in California agricultural unionism, first went to California as part of a &quot;Free Tom Mooney&quot; delegation. While imprisoned, Mooney corresponded with fellow union leader Ned Cobb of the Alabama Sharecroppers&#x27; Union.

During his time at San Quentin, Mooney was a highly dependable orderly in the prison hospital. Dorothea Lange went to the prison to photograph him, and one of the photographs she took was used in a poster published by the Tom Mooney Defense Committee.

In 1931, New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker made a solidarity visit to Tom&#x27;s sister Anna&#x27;s house in San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District.

==Release and later years==

Mooney filed a writ of habeas corpus which was heard by the United States Supreme Court in 1937. Even though he presented evidence that his conviction was obtained through the use of perjured testimony and that the prosecution had suppressed favorable evidence, his writ was denied because he had not first filed a writ in state court. Nevertheless, his case is important because it helped establish that a conviction based upon false evidence violates due process. Mooney was pardoned in 1939 by liberal Democratic governor Culbert Olson.

He was old from years in prison, sick with ulcers and jaundice. He had not worn his martyrdom well; he broke with modest Billings, who was convicted with him but somehow was never regarded as a martyr; he was estranged from his wife; his former colleagues in the labor movement often found him to be selfish and conceited.

Mooney then campaigned for Billings&#x27;s release although the two men had become estranged. He traveled around the country making speeches. He drew a full house at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Billings was released in 1939 and pardoned in 1961.

==Death and legacy==
After attempting a lecture tour, Mooney collapsed from illness. The California Federation of Labor turned down a resolution to pay his bills, as his politics were deemed too radical. While dying in a San Francisco hospital, Mooney, at 59, had only a few visitors, and only a few letters from friends. From his bed he helped advance a campaign to free Communist Earl Browder as Chairman of the &quot;Citizens&#x27; Committee to Free Earl Browder.&quot;

Mooney died at Saint Luke&#x27;s Hospital in San Francisco on March 6, 1942. A large funeral celebration was held at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium. He is interred at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

<text>Carel de Moor (25 February 1655 – 16 February 1738) was a Dutch Golden Age etcher and painter. He was a pupil of the Dutch Golden Age painter Gerard Dou.

==Biography==

Carel de Moor was born in Leiden. According to Houbraken, his father was an art dealer who wanted him to study languages and only allowed him to study art when his talent for drawing surfaced at a young age. Houbraken met him in person at the atelier of Godfried Schalcken when he was completing his education there. 
According to the RKD, he was the son of a Leiden painter of the same name and a pupil of Dou, Frans van Mieris, Godfried Schalcken, and Abraham van den Tempel. He became a member of the Leiden Guild of St. Luke in 1683, and became deacon many times over in the years 1688–1711. His own pupils later were Pieter Lyonet, Andrei Matveev, his own son Carel Isaak de Moor, Arent Pijl, Arnout Rentinck, Nicolaas Six and Mattheus Verheyden.
 He died in Leiden or Warmond.

<text>Addison Webster Moore (30 July 1866 – 25 August 1930) was a U.S. pragmatist philosopher. He was president of the Western Philosophical Association in 1911 and president of the American Philosophical Association in 1917.

He was born in Plainfield, Indiana, United States. He studied at DePauw University, earning an A.B. in 1890 and an A.M. in 1893. He then studied at Cornell (1893–94) and took his Ph.D. in 1898 at the University of Chicago, attracted by John Dewey&#x27;s arrival there. When Dewey went to Columbia University in 1904, Moore took over the Metaphysics and Logic courses at Chicago, and became professor of philosophy in 1909.

Moore was a supporter of Dewey&#x27;s instrumentalist version of pragmatism. In 1910, he published &quot;Pragmatism and Its Critics&quot;, consisting of one chapter explaining pragmatism and four chapters addressing criticisms directed towards this doctrine.

<text>Alexander A. Moore (October 1, 1874 – March 29, 1952) was a farmer and a provincial level politician from Alberta, Canada. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a by-election on November 3, 1919, and served until 1926.

==Political career==
Moore ran for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a provincial by-election held in the Cochrane electoral district on November 3, 1919. The by-election was called due to the death of speaker Charles Fisher. He defeated E.V. Thompson a candidate of the governing Liberals in a tough race.

The Liberals attempted to win the by-election by having every member of the Cabinet and many back benches in the Liberal caucus campaign in the district. Moore was selected at a nomination meeting held on July 16, 1919, and campaigned in the district well before the writ was dropped.

With Moore winning the by-election, he became the first member elected under the United Farmers banner, joining two farmer-friendly Non-Partisan League MLAs already in the legislature.

Moore was re-elected in the 1921 Alberta general election.

He served until 1926 before retiring.

<text>Alexander Pollock Moore (November 10, 1867 – February 17, 1930) was an American diplomat, editor and publisher.

==Biography==
Born in Pittsburgh on November 10, 1867, Moore was the publisher/owner of the &quot;Pittsburgh Leader&quot; when he married the stage actress Lillian Russell, becoming her fourth husband in 1912.

He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Pennsylvania in 1916.

After his wife died on June 6, 1922, Moore served as an ambassador twice: to Spain from 1923 to 1925 and to Peru from 1928 to 1929. As the Ambassador to Peru he played a significant role in negotiating the Tacna-Arica boundary agreement, settling a border dispute between Peru and Chile.

He died on February 17, 1930, in Los Angeles, California, shortly after he was appointed ambassador to Poland by President Hoover, and was interred at the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

<text>In thermodynamics, the entropy of fusion is the increase in entropy when melting a solid substance. This is almost always positive since the degree of disorder increases in the transition from an organized crystalline solid to the disorganized structure of a liquid; the only known exception is helium. It is denoted as formula_1 and normally expressed in joules per mole-kelvin, J/(mol·K).

A natural process such as a phase transition will occur when the associated change in the Gibbs free energy is negative.

==Helium==
Helium-3 has a negative entropy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. Helium-4 also has a very slightly negative entropy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, these substances freeze with the addition of heat.

<text>Benjamin Moore (October 5, 1748 – February 27, 1816) was the second Episcopal bishop of New York and the fifth President of Columbia University. He is remembered for having given Holy Communion to Alexander Hamilton on his deathbed, and for being the father of Clement Clarke Moore, the reputed author of the 1823 Christmas poem &quot;A Visit From St. Nicholas.&quot;

==Early life ==
Moore was born in Newtown, New York, now known as Elmhurst, Queens, in 1748, the son of Samuel Moore and Sarah (née Fish) Moore. He was the great-great-grandson of John Moore, the first Independent minister allowed in New England, and great-grandson of Capt. Samuel Moore, on whose property the Newtown Pippin apple was first cultivated. 

He attended King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University), graduating in 1768 with a degree of A.B. Moore received a master&#x27;s degree from King&#x27;s College in 1771, alongside Founding Father Gouverneur Morris. He traveled to England and was ordained deacon in the Anglican Church by Bishop Richard Terrick in Fulham Palace on June 24, 1774. He was advanced to the priesthood the next day.

==Career==
Not long after returning to America, in 1775, Moore was made assistant rector at Trinity Church, New York City&#x27;s original Anglican church, located then as now on Broadway at the western end of Wall Street. He was also named president pro tempore of Kings College and served until the arrival of the Continental Army in the city in April 1776 caused the college to close and disperse.

Trinity rector Charles Inglis was an outspoken Tory who welcomed the subsequent British occupation of New York. Moore continued to work at his side but stayed publicly neutral on the political questions surrounding the American Revolutionary War. After the British defeat Inglis left for England, and Moore was elected Trinity&#x27;s rector in 1783. Returning Patriot church members, among them Declaration of Independence co-author Robert R. Livingston and soon-to-be New York Mayor James Duane, objected to the choice, and in early 1784 Moore agreed to step aside in favor of Samuel Provoost, the only Anglican priest in New York who had openly supported the Revolution.

The Episcopal Church of the United States of America (ECUSA) became independent of the Anglican Church after the war, establishing its own organization of dioceses, and Provoost was elected the first bishop of New York in 1786, a position he held concurrently with the Trinity rectorship. Moore continued in his duties as assistant rector until 1800, when Provoost resigned and Moore was elected rector.

Concurrently with his church work Moore served from 1784 to 1787 as professor of rhetoric and logic at Columbia College, which in 1789 awarded him the degree of doctor of sacred theology. 

===Bishop of New York===
Moore was elected coadjutor bishop of New York in 1801 to assist Provoost, who wished to retire. The diocese of New York covered the entire state and the population was rapidly increasing upstate, with many migrants from New England. This area had been opened up for settlement and development as agricultural lands after the war due to the cession by the Iroquois League, allies of the British, of nearly five million acres of land.

Moore was the 9th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated in St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Trenton, New Jersey by Bishops William White, Thomas John Claggett, and Abraham Jarvis. That same year, Moore was elected President of Columbia College, as the compromise choice of a board of trustees deadlocked between Episcopal and non-Episcopal members. A contemporary explained the choice thusly: &quot;While he was a true, consistent, and I may add, an uncompromising Episcopalian, he was neither an aggressive or prescribing one.&quot; Because of his church responsibilities he neither taught nor was involved in the details of administration.

In 1811, Moore had a stroke. He resigned as Columbia&#x27;s president, and asked for the election of an additional coadjutor bishop to assist him. John Henry Hobart was elected to the post that year. In 1815, Bishop Provoost died, and Moore succeeded him to become the second full bishop of New York.

===Last communion for Hamilton===
On July 11, 1804, Moore was summoned to the deathbed of Alexander Hamilton, who had been fatally wounded in a duel with Aaron Burr; Hamilton asked to receive holy communion. Moore made two objections: that to participate in a duel was a mortal sin, and that Hamilton, although he was undoubtedly a sincere Christian in his later years, was not an Episcopalian. Moore withdrew, but was persuaded by the urgent pleas of Hamilton&#x27;s friends to return. On receiving Hamilton&#x27;s solemn assurance that he repented for his part in the duel, Moore gave him communion.

==Personal life==
In 1779, Moore married Charity Clarke, daughter of English officer Major Thomas Clarke, who had stayed in the colony after his service in the French and Indian War, and Mary Stilwell Clarke. Thomas Clarke had acquired a large country estate along the Hudson River in Manhattan that he dubbed Chelsea, after the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a retirement home for soldiers in London, England, and his widow and daughter continued to live there after his death in 1776. Charity Clarke wrote letters to a cousin in London in the 1760s and 1770s that are still cited as examples of early patriotic sentiment, but she and her mother stayed in British-occupied New York during the Revolutionary war. 

The Moores had one child together, Clement Clarke Moore (1779–1863), who is credited and is most widely known as the author of the Christmas poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas.&quot; They inherited the Chelsea estate and passed it on to their son, who developed it into the neighborhood of Chelsea, Manhattan. 

On February 27, 1816, Moore died in Greenwich Village, New York. He was buried at Trinity Church. North Moore Street, Manhattan is named in his honor.

<text>Daniel McFarlan Moore (February 27, 1869 – June 15, 1936) was an American electrical engineer and inventor. He developed a novel light source, the &quot;Moore lamp&quot;, and a business that produced them in the early 1900s. The Moore lamp was the first commercially viable light-source based on gas discharges instead of incandescence; it was the predecessor to contemporary neon lighting and fluorescent lighting. In his later career Moore developed a miniature neon lamp that was extensively used in electronic displays, as well as vacuum tubes that were used in early television systems.

== Early life ==
He was born in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, on February 27, 1869. Moore was the son of the Reverend Alexander Davis and Maria Louisa Douglas Moore. He graduated from Lehigh University in 1889. Moore married Mary Alice Elliott, of New York City, on June 5, 1895. They had three children: Dorothy Mae Moore (1900–1990), Elliott McFarlan Moore (1902–1933), and Beatrice Jean Moore (1912–2007).

==Career==
He began his career in 1890 working in the engineering department of the United Edison Manufacturing Company. At some point he started experimenting with producing light from glow discharges, which Heinrich Geissler had first developed in the 1850s. &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with my light?&quot; Thomas Edison is said to have asked when he learned that Moore had started to tinker with light-producing tubes of gas as a potential replacement for the incandescent bulb. Moore is reported to have replied undiplomatically, &quot;It&#x27;s too small, too hot and too red.&quot; Moore left in 1894 to form his own companies, the Moore Electric Company and the Moore Light Company.

===The Moore lamp===

Moore had devised his glow discharge lighting system by 1896. The Moore Lamp was an extension of the well-known Geissler tube, which used glass tubes from which the air had been removed and a different gas inserted. The low-pressure gas glows when a current is passed through it. As described in 1915, &quot;In the Moore system of lighting the essential feature is the introduction of a special valve which automatically admits gas into the tube as the supply becomes exhausted.&quot; The Moore lamps utilized nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the luminous gas; Moore&#x27;s innovation compensated for the gradual loss of gas in the lamp to the electrodes and the glass. Carbon dioxide gave a good quality white light. The first commercial installation was done in 1904 in a hardware store in Newark, New Jersey. The lamp yielded about 10 lumens per watt, which was about triple the output of incandescent lights based on carbon filaments. Arthur Bright has written, &quot;Despite the fact that the tube was expensive to install, complicated, and required very high voltages, its operating advantages were great enough for it to find restricted use in stores, offices, and similar general lighting uses as well as in photography and some advertising and decorative applications.&quot;

The modest success of the Moore tubes was among the drivers for developing better filaments for standard incandescent light bulbs. Tungsten filament bulbs were a great enough improvement over carbon filaments that the Moore tubes &quot;gradually disappeared from the market, leaving only short carbon-dioxide tubes in use for color matching, in which they excelled because of their daylight color. The General Electric Company absorbed the two Moore companies and Moore&#x27;s patents in 1912. Moore himself rejoined General Electric&#x27;s laboratory force.&quot;

===Miniature neon lamp===

Moore&#x27;s inventions at General Electric included a miniature neon lamp that remained a fixture in electronic displays throughout the twentieth century, and was a forerunner of plasma displays. Both the lamp and his further inventions were also important to the early development of television. In particular, around 1917 Moore developed a &quot;negative glow&quot; neon lamp. These were miniature lamps with a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for neon lighting; a Smithsonian Institution website notes, &quot;These small, low power devices use a physical principle called &#x27;coronal discharge.&#x27; Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps. Glow lamps found practical use as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the acceptance of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the 1970s.&quot; In 1924 he invented the vacuum bulbs used in what was at that time called &quot;telephotography&quot; (sending still pictures by electricity or radio), and in 1925 improved the invention for use in television.

Moore was awarded the John Scott Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1911.

==Death==
On June 15, 1936, at the age of 67, Moore was shot to death on the lawn of his home in East Orange, New Jersey, by an unemployed inventor who became enraged after finding that an invention he filed for was already the subject of a patent granted to Moore.

<text>Eva Moore (9 February 1868 – 27 April 1955) was an English actress. Her career on stage and in film spanned six decades, and she was active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. In her 1923 book of reminiscences, &quot;Exits and Entrances&quot;, she describes approximately ninety of her roles in plays, but she continued to act on stage until 1945. She also acted in more than two dozen films. Her daughter, Jill Esmond, was the first wife of Laurence Olivier.

==Early life and career==
Moore was born and educated in Brighton, Sussex, the eighth of ten children, the last of whom was the actress Decima Moore. Her parents were the chemist Edward Henry Moore and his wife, Emily (née Strachan) Moore. She attended Miss Pringle&#x27;s school in Brighton and then studied gymnastics and dancing in Liverpool. Returning to Brighton, she taught dancing. 

In 1891 she married actor/playwright Henry V. Esmond (1869–1922). They had three children: Jack (an actor), Jill (the actress Jill Esmond, first wife of Laurence Olivier) and Lynette, who did not survive infancy. Her husband wrote more than a dozen plays in which she appeared, and they appeared together in more than a dozen plays.
Moore made her first stage appearance at London&#x27;s Vaudeville Theatre on 15 December 1887, as Varney in &quot;Proposals&quot;. She next joined Toole&#x27;s company and appeared at Toole&#x27;s Theatre on 26 December of that year as the Spirit of Home in &quot;Dot&quot;. In 1888, she was back at the Vaudeville in a play with her sisters Jessie and Decima, &quot;Partners&quot;, by Robert Williams Buchanan. In 1890, she created the role of the countess of Drumdurris in the Arthur Wing Pinero play &quot;The Cabinet Minister&quot; at the Court Theatre. In 1892, she appeared as Minestra in the comic opera &quot;The Mountebanks&quot; by &quot;W. S. Gilbert&quot; and &quot;Alfred Cellier&quot;. The next year, she created the role of Pepita in the long-running &quot;Little Christopher Columbus&quot;. 

In 1894, she joined Charles Hawtrey and Lottie Venne in F. C. Burnand&#x27;s &quot;A Gay Widow&quot;. Other stage roles included Mabel Vaughn in &quot;The Wilderness&quot; (1901); Lady Ernestone in Esmond&#x27;s &quot;My Lady Cirtue&quot; and Wilhelmina Marr in his &quot;Billy&#x27;s Little Love Affair&quot; (both 1903); and Kathie in &quot;Old Heidelberg&quot; (1902 and 1909) with George Alexander. In 1907, she took the name part in &quot;Sweet Kitty Bellaire&quot; (1907) and played Mrs. Errol in &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, Mrs. Crowley in &quot;The Explorer&quot; in 1908, the Hon. Mrs. Bayle in &quot;Best People&quot; and Mrs. Rivers in &quot;The House Opposite&quot; in 1909.

==Later years and films==

Moore was active in the suffrage movement (as was her sister Decima), attending meetings and appearing in suffragist plays and films. She was a founder of the Actresses&#x27; Franchise League in 1908 but resigned from that organisation when other members objected to her acting in a sketch called &quot;Her Vote&quot;, by her husband, in which the heroine prefers kisses to votes. Moore later managed her husband&#x27;s comedy &quot;Eliza Comes to Stay&quot;, which opened at the Criterion Theatre on 12 February 1913, transferring to the Vaudeville Theatre on 6 July 1914, and then took the play to New York City for an unsuccessful run. After the First World War began, she continued acting at the Vaudeville in the evenings but worked as a volunteer during the day for the Women&#x27;s Emergency Corps, based at the Little Theatre.

She raised money for hospital and wartime causes and was honoured with the ordre de la Reine Elisabeth for her wartime activities. At the Royalty Theatre, she played Mrs. Culver in the 1918 play &quot;The Title&quot;, by Arnold Bennett, where she also played Mrs. Etheridge in &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Wife&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham and the title role in &quot;Mumsie&quot;. In October 1920, she and Esmond began an extensive tour of Canada with Nigel Bruce as their stage manager, who played Montague Jordan in &quot;Eliza Comes to Stay&quot;, which re-opened at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London on 14 June 1923.

From 1920 to 1946, Moore made over two dozen films, beginning with &quot;The Law Divine&quot; (1920). Some of her best-received silent films were &quot;Flames of Passion&quot; (1922), &quot;The Great Well&quot; (1924), &quot;Chu-Chin-Chow&quot; (1925) and &quot;Motherland&quot; (1927). Her most popular &#x27;talkies&#x27; included &quot;Almost a Divorce&quot; (1931), &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932), &quot;Leave It to Smith&quot; (1933), &quot;I Was a Spy&quot; (1933), &quot;Jew Süss&quot; (1934), &quot;A Cup of Kindness&quot; (1934), &quot;Vintage Wine&quot; (1935), &quot;The Divorce of Lady X&quot; (1938, which starred her son-in-law Laurence Olivier) and &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1946).

Moore published her reminiscences, &quot;Exits and Entrances&quot;, in 1923 but continued to act until 1945. In later years, she resided at Bisham, Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, dying of myocardial degeneration at age 87.

<text>Frank C. Moore II (June 22, 1953 – April 21, 2002) was a New York-based painter, winner of the Logan Medal of the Arts, and a member of the Visual AIDS Artist Caucus—the organization responsible for the (Red) Ribbon Project, A Day Without Art, and A Night Without Light.

Moore&#x27;s father, Earle K. Moore, was a communications and civil rights lawyer in Manhattan, who won a landmark case establishing that broadcast stations must serve the interests of their viewers. His sister, Rebecca Moore, would later become a computer scientist, environmentalist, and founder of Google Earth Outreach. Frank Moore was born in Manhattan in 1953, then moved with his family to Long Island, N.Y., first to Great Neck, and then to Roslyn, where he first attended Roslyn Junior High School. He graduated from Roslyn High School in 1971, where he had been active in student politics and served as class president. Moore&#x27;s work was selected for display for years in the high school halls. They were eventually removed during a renovation and subsequently lost.

He attended Yale, where he graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1975, and he studied at the Cité internationale des arts in Paris from 1977 to 1979. His art began appearing in group exhibitions in 1979, as he worked as a set designer for modern dance choreographer Jim Self in Manhattan.

Deeply indebted to Surrealism, Moore&#x27;s paintings frequently depict dream scenarios and futuristic landscapes, often with environmental sub-texts (in a picture-postcard Niagara Falls, chemical signatures of pollutants drift in the mist), or references to AIDS (in &quot;Viral Romance&quot;, 1992, a reversed bouquet blooms human immunodeficiency virus). His political stance was broad and nuanced with homoerotic imagery. He died of AIDS on April 21, 2002, aged 48. Late in 2012, the double exhibition &quot;Toxic Beauty&quot;, comprising the most comprehensive review of Moore&#x27;s work, was on view at New York University. His sister Rebecca Moore completed his work setting up the Gesso Foundation for artists after his death.

<text>Frank Frankfort Moore (1855–1931) was an Irish journalist, novelist, dramatist, and poet. He was a Belfast Protestant and a unionist, but his historical fiction during the years of Home Rule agitation did not shy from themes of Irish-Catholic dispossession.

==Belfast years==
Moore was born in Limerick, but was raised in Belfast where he records as his earliest memory was witnessing dragoons, sabres drawn, rushing sectarian rioters in the street below his nursery window.

Moore&#x27;s father was a successful clockmaker and jeweller, and the home was relatively cultured (both French and German were spoken). However, as a member of the ultra-puritan Open Brethren sect the elder Moore sought to restrict his children&#x27;s reading to religious and didactic titles. The evangelist Michael Paget Baxter, who identified the Emperor Napoleon III as the Beast of the Book of Revelation, was a regular visitor.

Moore was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution where he quickly learned to distance himself from his father&#x27;s beliefs. He recalled the circulation of some scurrilous verses entitled &quot;Mr. Baxter and The Beast&quot;, &quot;proving&quot; that Baxter himself was the Antichrist.

In 1874 Moore hailed the declaration of scientific materialism by the Irish physicist John Tyndall at a conference of the British Science Association in Belfast and mocked the outraged reaction of local Presbyterian ministers. Moore did not disguise his disdain for the fevered evangelism of the Ulster Revival. He was to write that &quot;if ever a mortal heard the voice of God, it would be in the garden at the cool of the day&quot;. He later took Anglican communion in the Church of Ireland.

From 1875 Moore worked for local, conservative and unionist, paper, &quot;The News Letter,&quot; but secured international assignments for a wider range of publications, including London titles. In 1878 he reported on the Berlin Congress which reconfigured the Balkans, and in 1879 (with an enthusiasm for empire) wrote despatches from South Africa on the Zulu War. He went on to travel and report from India, Burma and South America. Back in Belfast he became arts reviewer (sometimes writing with libellous invective), leader-writer and eventually assistant editor. He was described as &quot;a compulsive writer - never revising - with an uncannily acute and retentive memory&quot;.

==Successful writer and commentator on Ulster==
It has been suggested that Moore&#x27;s reputation in Belfast for journalistic vitriol &quot;reflected a sense of entrapment among provincial philistines&quot;. As a schoolboy he had shown an early aptitude for poetry, publishing a volume of verse in 1872 which drew a letter of encouragement from the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In 1875, at the age of 20, he published two further poetry collections, &quot;Flying from a shadow&quot; and &quot;Dawn&quot;, and one prose volume, &quot;Sojourners together&quot;. The first of these is an imaginary travelogue whose scope is the span of the British empire, the globe &quot;charted by a vision tragic and romantic, much in the style of Tennyson or Wordsworth but in the rhythm of the Victorian hymnal&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s 1893 novel, &quot;&quot;I Forbid the Banns&quot;: the Story of a Comedy that was Played Seriously&quot;, was eventually to sell over half a million copies. The heroine, a young Australian women, scandalises society by operating on the principle that &quot;if marriage is founded upon true affection, the tie will be regarded as sacred by the man and the woman without the necessity of any civil contract&quot;. Complications ensue and the experiment proves a failure.

The success of the novel gave Moore gave the confidence to launch himself a literary career--in London. He celebrated his departure from Belfast by publishing a collection of anecdotal reminiscences, &quot;A Journalist&#x27;s Notebook&quot; (1894) which gave widespread offence to his former colleagues.

Moore was to publish over 80 novels. &quot;The Jessamy Bride&quot; (1897), a sentimental tale of romance between Mary Horneck and Oliver Goldsmith and involving, among other historical characters, Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke, was a major success. He wrote several plays ranging from scenes of Goldsmith’s life to one on Nell Gwyn and including a four act verse play entitled &quot;The Mayflower&quot; (1892).

Moore was a committed unionist. “It is better&quot;, he wrote, &quot;to be separated from the rest of Ireland than from Great Britain”. Yet in &quot;The Truth about Ulster&quot; (1914) Moore allowed that the Protestants, in important respects, remained a planted &quot;colony&quot; and he expressed understanding but little sympathy for their sectarian passions. In his novel &quot;The Ulsterman&quot; (1914) he has the son of a bigoted mill-owner marrying a Catholic girl. In &quot;The Lady of the Reef&quot; (1915) an English artist living in Paris travels to County Down to claim an inheritance and is baffled by the strength of local anti-Catholic feeling.

Moore also wrote novels with Irish historical themes that might have been thought more conducive to nationalist sympathies. &quot;Castle Omeragh&quot; (1903) is set in the west of Ireland during Cromwell’s ravages and its sequel &quot;Captain Latymer&quot; (1908) the Irish hero escapes transportation to Barbados with a clan daughter of the Irish chieftain Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill.

Yet Moore&#x27;s ultimate sympathies were &quot;never in doubt.&quot; In &quot;The Truth About Ulster&quot; he asserted that New York City&#x27;s Tammany Hall &quot;acted from generation to generation for the Ulstermen to point to as an example of the form of Home Rule that is the ideal of the Irishman&quot;. The ethno-Irish Democratic-Party machine was a demonstration of the corrupt practices that would be a mark an Irish parliament. On these lines Moore wrote satires of Irish Home Rule such as &quot;Diary of an Irish Cabinet Minister&quot; (1893), &quot;The Viceroy of Muldoon&quot; and &quot;The Rise and Fall of Larry O’Lannigan JP&quot; (1893), albeit in &quot;the gentle mould of Somerville and Ross rather than the turbulent bigotry of [the unionist leaders] Carson and Craig&quot;.

Where Moore&#x27;s fiction portrays Cromwell&#x27;s crimes of conquest, the Lord Protector nonetheless retains the aura of &quot;a Carlylean Great Man&quot;. His Gaels, by comparison, are &quot;inefficient fantasists&quot;. It is suggested that Moore &quot;feared the mass Catholicism of the western peasantry and the Belfast slums as the enemy of individual freedom and economic progress&quot;.

Moore’s wife of twenty years, Alice (Balcombe) (whose sister Florence, married to Bram Stoker, had given him access to the theatrical world.), died in 1901. He remarried to Dorothea Hatton and moved to Lewes, Sussex. Here he wrote &quot;A Garden of Peace&quot; (1919) under the pseudonym &quot;Frank Littlemore&quot; which celebrated &quot;the settled order of the English countryside&quot;. He did write a series of articles on Victorian Belfast in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; in 1924, subsequently published as &quot;Belfast by the Sea&quot; (1928). While these celebrate &quot;the achievements of late Victorian Belfast and the traders and professionals of its main streets&quot;, the Ireland that he describes in his last work, &quot;A Mixed Grill&quot; (1930), has been described as &quot;a country best suited to the gentlemanly pursuit of hunting, now departed.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Moore died in Lewes in May 1931. He was survived by three daughters.

After his death several of his plays were published, and some staged at The Gaiety, Dublin and The Royal in Limerick as well as in London. He is mentioned briefly in Peter Kavanagh’s book &quot;The Irish Theatre&quot; (1946). But his fiction, some of which has been compared to the adventurous tales of Jack London, seems to have been mostly forgotten.

<text>John Bassett Moore (December 3, 1860 – November 12, 1947) was an American lawyer and authority on international law. Moore was a State Department official, a professor at Columbia University, and a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice from 1922 to 1928, the first American judge to sit on that judicial body.

==Biography==
Moore was born in Smyrna, Delaware on December 3, 1860.

Moore graduated from the University of Virginia and was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1883. He practiced law in Wilmington, Delaware, before working as a law clerk at the Department of State from 1885 to 1886. He was the third assistant secretary of state from 1886 to 1891, when he became Hamilton Fish Professorship of International Law and Diplomacy at Columbia Law School, the first chair of international law in the United States. Moore remained a Columbia professor until retiring in 1924, taking frequent leaves of absence to take up U.S. diplomatic posts.&quot;&quot;

Moore briefly was assistant secretary of state in 1898.

During his service with the Department of State he acted as secretary to the Conference on Samoan Affairs (1887) and to the Fisheries Conference (1887–1888).

After the close of the war with Spain was secretary and council to the American Peace Commission at Paris. In 1901, he served as professor of International Law at the Naval War College, where he initiated that college&#x27;s long series of &quot;International Law Blue Book&quot; publications. Subsequently, Moore represented the government as agent before the United States and Dominican Arbitration Tribunal (1904), as delegate to the Fourth International American Conference at Buenos Aires and special plenipotentiary to the Chilean centenary (both 1910), and as delegate to the International Commission of Jurists at Rio de Janeiro (1912).

Moore&#x27;s most popular work was the eight-volume &quot;Digest of International Law&quot; (1906)&quot;.&quot; After completing the work, he suffered a nervous breakdown.&quot;&quot; He subsequently took a vacation for more than two years, traveling the world.&quot;&quot;

Moore was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1907 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1919.

He was on the Hague Tribunal from 1912 to 1938.

Moore was a critic of the League of Nations, considering it a weak institution.&quot;&quot;

In 1921, Moore was elected a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice. While on the bench, he declined the position of the court presidency multiple times, arguing that an overseas judge should not hold that position. He resigned from the court in 1928 in order to focus on his scientific obligations.

Moore was a proponent of neutrality, believing that the post-World War I system of alliances would tend to broaden wars into global conflicts. He was also a strong believer in the principle of separation of powers under the United States Constitution, asserting in 1921, &quot;There can hardly be room for doubt that the framers of the constitution, when they vested in Congress the power to declare war, never imagined that they were leaving it to the executive to use the military and naval forces of the United States all over the world for the purpose of actually coercing other nations, occupying their territory, and killing their soldiers and citizens, all according to his own notions of the fitness of things, as long as he refrained from calling his action war or persisted in calling it peace.&quot;

==Legacy and awards==

Moore was honored on a U.S. definitive postage stamp issued December 3, 1966, the five-dollar value of the Prominent Americans series.

In 1922, a new school was dedicated to Moore in his hometown of Smyrna, Delaware. The John Bassett Moore Intermediate School now serves as a public school for the fifth and sixth grades.

In 1927, Moore was awarded the Theodore Roosevelt Medal.

Moore died at his home in New York City on November 12, 1947, and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.

<doc id="837789" wikidata="Q1484077" url="?curid=837789" title="Hakarimata Range">
<text>Hakarimata Range is a range of hills on the western edge of Ngāruawāhia township, in the Waikato region of New Zealand, overlooking the confluence of the Waikato and Waipā Rivers. The Hakarimata Range is separated from the Taupiri Range by the Taupiri Gorge, through which the Waikato River flows.

After the invasion of the Waikato, parts of the Hakarimatas were confiscated in 1864. of native forest on the range are protected as a scenic reserve. A council supported community group, the Hakarimata Restoration Trust, created in 2001, is helping care for the range.

==Location==
Although now usually applied to the hills immediately west of Ngāruawāhia, maps such as Hochstetter&#x27;s of 1859, the 1925 geology map and 1944 one inch map show &#x27;Hakarimata Range&#x27; as extending south to what is now SH23. Similarly, old accounts describe the Whatawhata-Raglan road as passing over the Hakarimatas.

==Name==
Hakarimata&#x27;s name derives from a 17th-century feast, when Ngāti Maniapoto joined the local Waikatos to celebrate the birth of a child. There was a mountain of raw forest foods; hence the name Hākari-kai-mata (uncooked food mountain), condensed to Hakarimata.

==Geology==
Hakarimata is part of the roughly north - south Kawhia Syncline (Taupiri to the north, Kapamahunga to the south), though the Hakarimata Anticline is at about a 30° angle to the rest of the syncline, probably due to strike slip movement along the Waipa Fault, Late Triassic Newcastle Group, sandstones, siltstones and greywacke have been folded, faulted and covered by other sedimentary rocks to form the Hakarimatas.

==Flora and fauna==
===Plants===
Hakarimata is the largest remnant of broadleaf-podocarp lowland forest that once dominated the Waikato. It is near the southern limit of kauri forest and northern limit of beech forest, with plants and animals of all three forest types. Occasional large rata and rimu stand above the canopy of tawa, kohekohe, hinau, rewarewa, mangeao and pukatea. There are also some miro, Hall&#x27;s totara and tanekaha. The reserve also contains several threatened plants including Alseuosmia quercifolia, or topara, which is strongly scented in spring.

===Animals===
Tūī, kererū, pīwakawaka, pīpīwharauroa, kārearea, pekapeka, copper skink, Auckland green gecko and peripatus are among the species in the bush. 16 species of native fish include short and longfinned eels and banded, short-jaw and giant, kōkopu. In 1995/96, to connect the Hakarimata tree canopy with the Waikato River, and thus encourage indigenous fish, three Waikato tributaries had of fences, 12 stock-water troughs, 5 bridges, and over 10,000 trees and shrubs added. By 2003, fish had increased from 63 to 80 fish per of stream and a new species, lamprey, was found.

==Pests==
Since the land was reserved (from 1905 onwards), the fringe areas and lower slopes have slowly regenerated after suffering light logging, fires, pigs, goats, possums, cats, hedgehogs, rats, mice, stoats, weasels and ferrets, with occasional deer and wallaby. Goats, possum and rats are controlled, with possum self-resetting traps trialled in 2011. About of privately owned forest adjoin the reserve, some of which is protected by covenant. Kauri dieback disease is not present, so a boot cleaning station was put at the Huntly end in 2015.

Fire is also a threat. In 2017 an area of 600 by 300m on a ridge beside the quarry was burnt.

==Quarry==
The large quarry at 181 Waingaro Road, Ngāruawāhia, opened in a quarry reserve in 1948 and now goes well below sea-level. It was bought by Brian Perry Ltd in the 1980s and sold to Fulton Hogan in 2016. An extension which would have doubled the size of the quarry wasn&#x27;t permitted in 2008. It would have taken native trees estimated to be 800 years old. The quarry then employed 13 and supplied about 35% of the area&#x27;s needs. Environment Waikato granted Perry Aggregates resource consents in 2009, following which bait stations were put in the area in 2011 and the quarry was given Mimico Environmental Awards for that and, in 2018, for extending native fish passage.

==Tracks==
The range has been used for recreational rambling since at least 1892.

There are two main walkways through the range, allowing excellent views of the Waikato Plains below. The main one is Hakarimata Walkway (12 km, 7 hr 30 min) along the ridge from Parker Road at the northern end to the Hakarimata Rail Trail (off Waingaro Rd) at the south.

Te Araroa follows that walkway to the summit, where a viewing tower offers vistas towards the coast, across the Waikato Basin and to Ruapehu on a clear day. Te Aroroa drops from the summit by the other main walkway, Hakarimata Summit Track (2 km, 3 hr return, 335 metres on 1349 steps), to Brownlee Avenue in Ngāruawāhia. The steps had 140,000 visits in 2016, compared to 5000 in 2011, shortly after they opened. The remainder of the track south to Hakarimata Rail Trail (3.5 km, 2 hr) can be linked by a 1.8 km walk along Waingaro Road back to Brownlee Ave.

There are several shorter walks using parts of the Hakarimata Walkway and/or the Summit Track:-
* At the northern end, Kauri Loop Track (3 km, 2 hr return for full loop; 40 min to kauri grove) from Parker Road car park starts with a long flight of steps to one of the largest kauris in Waikato, girth and high, estimated to be over a thousand years old. The Southern Lookout has views of Huntly and the north Waikato lakes, Hamilton and Tongariro on a clear day.
* In the middle, Waterworks Walk (1 km, 1 hr return) from Brownlee Avenue runs beside Mangarata Stream to the 1922 reservoir, once Ngāruawāhia&#x27;s water supply. In November 2016 a Tomokanga (archway) was added near the beginning of the walk.
* At the southern end, Hakarimata Rail Trail (1.5 km, 30 min) follows the former Glen Massey railway. A short extension leads to the Cascades.

<text>Stanford Moore (September 4, 1913 – August 23, 1982) was an American biochemist. He shared a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1972, with Christian B. Anfinsen and William Howard Stein, for work done at Rockefeller University on the structure of the enzyme ribonuclease and for contributing to the understanding of the connection between the chemical structure and catalytic activity of the ribonuclease molecule.

Moore attended Peabody Demonstration School, now known as University School of Nashville, and in 1935 graduated summa cum laude from Vanderbilt University, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Sigma. He earned his doctorate in Organic Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1938. Moore then joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute, later Rockefeller University, where he spent his entire professional career, with the exception of a period of government service during World War II. He became Professor of Biochemistry in 1952.

In 1958, he and William H. Stein developed the first automated amino acid analyzer, which facilitated the determination of protein sequences. In 1959, Moore and Stein announced the first determination of the complete amino acid sequence of an enzyme, ribonuclease, work which was cited in the Nobel award.

<text>Zephaniah Swift Moore (November 20, 1770 – June 29, 1823) was an American Congregational clergyman and educator. He taught at Dartmouth College during the early 1810s and had a house built in Hanover, New Hampshire, that now serves as Dartmouth&#x27;s Blunt Alumni Center. He served as the President of Williams College between 1815 and 1821 and the first President of Amherst College between 1821 and 1823. He is most famous for leaving Williams in order to found Amherst, taking some of the faculty and 15 students with him. The rumor that Williams College library books were also taken to Amherst College was declared false in 1995 by Williams College President Harry C. Payne.

Moore died two years after Amherst was founded, and was succeeded by Heman Humphrey, a trustee of Williams College. Moore&#x27;s departure from Williams College established the foundation for the intense Williams–Amherst rivalry that persists to the present. To this day, he is regarded with a measure of derision on the Williams campus.

Cyrus Pitt Grosvenor wrote to him in 1823.

<text>Thomas Hinman Moorer (February 9, 1912 – February 5, 2004) was an admiral and naval aviator in the United States Navy who served as the 18th Chief of Naval Operations from 1967 to 1970 and 7th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1970 to 1974. He famously accused President Lyndon B. Johnson of having covered up that the 1967 attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; by Israel was a deliberate act. Moorer was also implicated in a spy ring within the White House during the Nixon administration, but never prosecuted.
==Early life, education, and ancestry==
Moorer was born in Mount Willing, Alabama on February 9, 1912. His father, a dentist, named his son for his favorite professor at Atlanta-Southern Dental College, Dr. Thomas Hinman. Moorer was raised in Eufaula, Alabama with his siblings, including his brother Joseph, who would also become a Navy Admiral.

On March 31, 1970 he became a member of the Alabama Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR). He was assigned national SAR member number 99,634 and Alabama Society number 759. He was later awarded the Society&#x27;s Gold Good Citizenship Medal. He was also a member of the Naval Order of the United States.

==Naval career==

Moorer graduated from the United States Naval Academy on June 1, 1933 and was commissioned an ensign. After completing Naval Aviation training at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in 1936, he flew with fighter squadrons based on the aircraft carriers , and .

===World War II===
In addition to his carrier-based fighter experience, Moorer also qualified in seaplanes and flew with a patrol squadron in the early years of World War II. Serving with Patrol Squadron Twenty-Two at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, when the Japanese Empire attacked on December 7, 1941 Moorer&#x27;s account of Pearl Harbor attack has been published under the title &quot;A Patrol in the wrong direction&quot;. His squadron subsequently participated in the 1941–42 Dutch East Indies Campaign in the southwest Pacific, where he flew numerous combat missions. Moorer received a Purple Heart after being shot down and wounded off the coast of Australia on 19 February 1942. He then survived an attack on the freighter which rescued him and his crew, &quot;Florence D.&quot;, which was bombed and sunk the same day by enemy aircraft involved in the first Bombing of Darwin. Moorer also received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his valor three months later when he braved Japanese air superiority to fly supplies into, and evacuate wounded out of, the island of Timor.

===Vietnam War===
Promoted to vice admiral in 1962, and to admiral in 1964, Moorer served both as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the United States Atlantic Fleet — the first Navy officer to have commanded both fleets. Moorer was Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet at the time of the Gulf of Tonkin incident and ordered an internal investigation into the conflicting reports which emerged following the event.

Moorer served as Chief of Naval Operations between 1967 and 1970, at the height of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, when he worked closely with the most senior officers in the U.S. military and government.

===Attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot;===
Moorer came to the conclusion that the attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; in 1967 was a deliberate act on the part of the Israelis and that President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered the cover-up to maintain ties with Israel. Moorer stated that &quot;Israel attempted to prevent the &quot;Liberty&quot;&#x27;s 
radio operators from sending a call for help by jamming American emergency radio channels. [And that] Israeli torpedo boats machine-gunned lifeboats at close range that had been lowered to rescue the most-seriously wounded.&quot; Moorer stated that there had been a conspiracy to cover up the event and asked whether &quot;our government put Israel&#x27;s interests ahead of our own? If so, Why? Does our government continue to subordinate American interests to Israeli interests?&quot; In a 1983 interview, Moorer said: &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a President – I don&#x27;t care who he is – stand up to them [the Israelis]. It just boggles your mind. They always get what they want. The Israelis know what is going on all the time. I got to the point where I wasn&#x27;t writing anything down. If the American people understood what a grip those people have got on our government, they would rise up in arms. Our citizens don&#x27;t have any idea what
goes on.&quot;

Admiral Moorer was present at the Medal of Honor presentation ceremony for the &quot;Liberty’s&quot; commanding officer, Captain William L. McGonagle. Captain McGonagle was presented the award by Secretary of the Navy Paul Ignatius away from the White House, which broke with longstanding tradition of such awards being presented by the President of the United States in a public ceremony (McGonagle&#x27;s Medal of Honor is the only one to be awarded in such a manner). Admiral Moorer explained this was because the attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; had been covered-up by the incumbent presidential administration.

Moorer told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1991: &quot;To suggest that they couldn&#x27;t identify the ship is…ridiculous… Anybody who could not identify the &quot;Liberty&quot; could not tell the difference between the White House and the Washington Monument.&quot; Moorer remained an outspoken advocate for &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors: &quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous to say this was an accident. There was good weather, she was flying the U.S. flag and the planes and torpedo boats attacked over a long period of time. I think Congress should investigate the incident, even now.&quot; Moorer wrote in 1997: &quot;I have never believed that the attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; was a case of mistaken identity. That is ridiculous. I have flown over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, thousands of hours, searching for ships and identifying all types of ships at sea. The &quot;Liberty&quot; was the ugliest, strangest-looking ship in the U.S. Navy. As a communications intelligence ship, it was sprouting every kind of antenna. It looked like a lobster with all those projections moving every which way. Israel knew perfectly well that the ship was American.&quot;

It took Moorer&#x27;s personal intervention to reverse a U.S. Naval Academy decision to not include the names of two &quot;Liberty&quot; crew members who were killed in action on a memorial wall at Bancroft Hall. The crew members in question were Lieutenant Commander Philip Armstrong Jr. and Lieutenant Stephen Toth. Moorer angrily commented on the Academy&#x27;s attempt to omit the names: &quot;I intervened and was able to reverse the apparent idea that dying in a cowardly, one-sided attack by a supposed ally is somehow not the same as being killed by an avowed enemy.&quot;

On the 24th anniversary of the attack (in 1991), Moorer attended a ceremony at the White House meant to honor &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors. Many were in attendance, including Captain William McGonagle. Instead of President George H. W. Bush greeting the survivors, which was expected, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft greeted them. Moorer described it as &quot;very emotional.&quot;

In 2003, Moorer headed an independent commission to investigate the details of the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident. The commission determined, among other things, that the state of Israel had deliberately attacked an American ship in international waters, killing 34 U.S. sailors in the process and perpetrating an act of war. Also participating in the commission was Marine General Raymond G. Davis, Rear Admiral Merlin Staring, and former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia James E. Akins. The so-called Moorer Commission submitted their findings to the United States government along with a request for a proper Congressional investigation of the attack. No investigation has been conducted.

Less than a month before his death (in 2004), Moorer made another call for an investigation into the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident and an end to the “disgraceful” cover-up.

===Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===
Moorer served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1970 until 1974.

While Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Moorer personally masterminded the 1972 mining of Hai Phong Harbor and believed that if such an operation had been conducted in 1964 it would have &quot;made a significant difference in the outcome of the war.&quot;

Excerpts from Moorer&#x27;s diary during his time as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been declassified, and include a note about an Air Force general telling the Joint Chiefs of Staff during a 1971 meeting that in a nuclear war the United States “could lose two hundred million people and still have more than we had at the time of the Civil War.” In December 1972, President Nixon ordered Operation Linebacker II, better known as the Christmas Bombings, saying to Moorer on 14 December: &quot;I don&#x27;t want any more of this crap about the fact that we couldn&#x27;t hit this target or that one. This is your chance to use military power to win this war, and if you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll hold you responsible&quot;.

While chairman, Moorer was fed a steady diet of confidential documents that had been stolen by a Joint Chiefs of Staff spy ring within the White House overseen by Admiral Robert Welander, the JCS liaison officer to the National Security Council. Welander was supplied with documents stolen by Navy Yeoman Charles Radford from White House desks and burn bags and the briefcases of Henry Kissinger and Gen. Alexander Haig, among other places in the White House. The spy ring operated for about 13 months before being uncovered by Nixon aide John Ehrlichman. Welander and Radford admitted to the thefts, felonies under the Espionage Act. Welander and Radford eventually were transferred to remote military outposts. Attorney General John Mitchell informed Moorer that the administration knew of the spy ring, but Nixon, apparently concerned about the potential political fallout, ordered that no prosecution take place. 

Upon completion of his second two-year term as CJCS, Moorer retired from the Navy on July 1, 1974.

==Death and legacy==
In an interview with the journalist Stanley Karnow in 1981, Moorer expressed much bitterness about how the Vietnam War was fought, saying: &quot;We should have fought in the north, where everyone was the enemy, where you didn&#x27;t have to worry whether or not you were shooting friendly civilians. In the south, we had to cope with women concealing grenades in their brassieres, or in their baby&#x27;s diapers. I remember two of our Marines being killed by a youngster who they were teaching to play volleyball. But Lyndon Johnson didn&#x27;t want to overthrow the North Vietnamese government. Well, the only reason to go to war is to overthrow a government you don&#x27;t like&quot;.

Moorer died on February 5, 2004, at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland at the age of 91. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

The National Guard Armory (Fort Thomas H. Moorer Armory) in Fort Deposit, Alabama is named after Moorer, as is a middle school in Eufaula, Alabama.

==Dates of rank==

*&quot;At the time of Admiral Moorer&#x27;s promotion, all rear admirals wore two stars, but the rank was divided into an &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower half&quot; for pay purposes&quot;

<text>Raw Spirit: In Search of the Perfect Dram is a nonfiction book by Iain Banks, first published in 2003. It is his only nonfiction book.

The book is about whisky, or finding the perfect dram while travelling in Scotland. Other recurring themes in the book are George W. Bush, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and Banks&#x27; love for motor vehicles.

==History==
Banks has said that he &quot;got a phone call from my agent saying that another publisher had come up with the idea of me going round distilleries in search of the perfect malt, and was I interested? Originally they wanted me to go round the Highlands in a black cab with some garrulous Glasgow cabbie or whatever, but we got rid of that idea and I drove myself.&quot;

==Description==
Banks tells the story of a series of road trips in (or on) some of his extensive collection of vehicles, visiting and exploring many of Scotland&#x27;s finest whiskies. From early on, he brings an unpretentious approach:

The book also celebrates some of Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Great Wee Roads&quot; (and even &quot;Daft Wee Roads&quot;) and Banks&#x27;s love for driving on them.

There are long meanders into descriptions of his friends, food, wine, and Banks&#x27;s contempt for Tony Blair and George W. Bush—for example:

Banks has said he felt more relaxed when writing this book; critics said that this comes across on reading it.

==Radio reading==
Jimmy Chisholm read an abridgment by Laurence Wareing in the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Book of the Week&quot; slot between 8 December and 12 December 2003. The producer was David Young; Chisholm recorded all five of the fifteen-minute programmes on 19 November 2003.

<text>Francisco de Moraes Cabral, also spelled Francisco de Morais Cabral (1500? – 1572), was a Portuguese writer. Born in Bragança, he served as personal secretary to the Portuguese ambassador in France, and composed, during two voyages to Paris (1540 and 1546), a chivalric romance called &quot;Palmeirim de Inglaterra&quot;; &quot;Palmerin of England&quot;), a &quot;spin-off&quot; of the popular series.

Moraes&#x27; work would also obtain considerable success across Europe. Because of its title, it was particularly successful in England, where it was reprinted several times. A Spanish translation was made by Luis Hurtado in 1547, preceding the actual publication of the Portuguese text in 1567. It was translated from the Portuguese by Eugène-François Garay de Montglave and can be found in Eugène Renduel, &quot;Bibliothèque portugaise Warnier&quot;, 1829, Paris, 4 vol.

He also wrote an autobiographical work called &quot;Desculpas de uns amores&quot;, set in France, which was published posthumously in 1624. He died at Évora.

<text>Luis de Morales (1509 – 9 May 1586) was a Spanish painter active during the Spanish Renaissance in the 16th century. Known as &quot;El Divino&quot;, most of his work was of religious subjects, including many representations of the Madonna and Child and the Passion.

Influenced by Raphael Sanzio and the of Leonardo da Vinci, especially in his early work, he was called by his contemporaries &quot;The Divine Morales&quot; because of his skill and the shocking realism of his paintings, and because of the spirituality transmitted by all his work.

His work has been divided by critics into two periods, an early stage marked by the influence of Florentine artists such as Michelangelo, and a more intense, more anatomically correct later stage with similarities to the works of German and Flemish Renaissance painters. The Prado Museum in Madrid holds around 22 paintings by Morales. Some of his works can also be seen at Salamanca&#x27;s Cathedral and Museum in Plasencia and the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.

<text>Sir Robert Laurie Morant, (7 April 1863 – 13 March 1920) was an English administrator and educationalist.

==Career overview==
Born in Hampstead, Morant was the older brother of Amy Morant. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford where he took a First in Theology.

After a year teaching at a Preparatory School he was appointed as tutor to the crown prince of Siam. On his return he worked at the Toynbee Hall settlement in the East End of London.

He then joined a research unit reporting to the Privy Council on Education and thence to the Board of Education, where he rose rapidly and served as private secretary to Sir John Gorst, Vice-President of the Committee on Education until 1902. He was responsible for some of the new ideas in the Education Act 1902, and was appointed Permanent Secretary to the Education Board in April 1903, being thus placed in a position to ensure the Board effectively implemented the act. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours, and promoted to Knight Commander (KCB) of the order in the 1907 Birthday Honours.

In 1905 he was involved in a dispute concerning a school inspection report by Katherine Bathurst and her outspoken views on elementary education for under fives. This resulted in Bathurst having to resign and for the ministry publishing her report but with Morant&#x27;s apologies and annotations.

In 1911 he was forced to resign as Permanent Secretary of the Board of Education after the leaking of a confidential report critical of school inspectors. Written by the chief inspector, it disparaged inspectors who had no more than an elementary education and recommended that inspectors should in future been drawn from Oxbridge graduates. Under pressure of work, Morant approved the report without reading it and, as a civil servant, was unable to reply to public criticism, including questions in the House of Commons, and from Edmond Holmes. He then accepted a post chairing the commission to implement the National Insurance Act 1911. This included a huge and wide-ranging task of administration and even included the foundation of the precursor of the Medical Research Council. Morant promoted and largely drafted the National Insurance Act 1913, correcting problems in the previous Act.

He served on the Haldane committee on the machinery of government, 1917–18.

When the Ministry of Health was created in 1919 he became its Permanent Secretary.

He died of influenza on 13 March 1920 aged 56.

In 1917 Beatrice Webb called him &quot;the one man of genius in the Civil Service&quot;, and A. L. Rowse, writing in 1942, said he was &quot;by universal acclaim the greatest civil servant of his time&quot;.

==Family==
In 1896 he married Helen Mary Cracknell.

<text>Kastamonu, formerly Kastamone/Castamone () and Kastamon/Castamon (), is a city in northern Turkey. It is the seat of Kastamonu Province and Kastamonu District. Its population is 125,622 (2021). The city lies at an elevation of . It is located in the southern part of the province.

== History ==


There are many ideas about the derivation of the name Kastamonu:

According to the first view, it should be considered that the name Kastamonu is Turkishized from the name Paphlagonía [Greek &quot;land of Paphlagon (people)&quot;]. The region covering the West Black Sea and Central Black Sea regions was called Paphlagonia before the Turks. Today, Kastamonu, Sinop, Bartın, Çankırı and Karabük are located in this region, while parts of Çorum, Bolu, Zonguldak and Samsun provinces remain within the region. The Paphlagonians, who dominated this region in 1000 BC, gave their name to this geography.

According to a second opinion, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the name Kastama, which was used for the same region in the Hittite period. The name Kastama turned into Kastamonu over time.

According to another view, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the combination of the words Gas and Tumanna. Gas, or better known as Kashkas, are among the first settlers of Kastamonu. Tumanna is the name of a city/region located on Kastamonu at that time. The combination of these two words took the form of Kastamonu over time.

According to a third opinion, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the combination of the words Kastra and Komnen. The word Kastra means &quot;castle&quot; in Latin. The Komnens are a Byzantine Dynasty and the settlers of this region during the Byzantine period. These two words took the form of Kastamonu over time.

Ibn Battuta visited the city, noting it as &quot;one of the largest and finest cities, where commodities are abundant and prices low.&quot; He stayed here forty days.

The famous Sufi saint of the city is Sheikh Shaban Veli (&quot;Şaban-ı Veli&quot; in Turkish, d. 976 AH/1569 AD).

The Dress Code Revolution under President Mustafa Kemal Pasha (later known as Atatürk) was started on August 23, 1925, at Kastamonu. He made his historical speech concerning the &quot;Hat and Dress Revolution&quot; during his visit to Kastamonu in 1925 in the Republican People&#x27;s Party building. The building is now used as the Archeological Museum of Kastamonu. The possessions used by Atatürk in his Kastamonu visit are also exhibited in the museum.

==Cuisine==
Typical country fare in Kastamonu includes a quick rose petal jam made with sugared water, citric acid and &quot;gül mayası&quot; – the latter is a preparation of culinary-grade rose petals with sugar and citric acid that preserves them and brings out their flavor and fragrance. Homemade hot sauce is made by simmering grated tomato, garlic, Turkish red pepper, hot peppers, sunflower oil, salt and pepper on the stove. Sweet &quot;katmer&quot; is made by preparing a simple unleavened dough of flour, salt and water that is smeared with a tahini and sunflower oil mixture as it is folded.

Breakfast might include farm made cheese, olives, pekmez, fried potatoes, rose jam homemade hot sauce, eggs served hot in the pan (called &quot;sahanda yumurta&quot;), folded unleavened bread called &quot;katmer&quot;, fresh farm milk and black tea.

A speciality of Taşköprü, Kastamonu is freshly slaughtered whole lamb slow-cooked over the glowing embers of wood in a sealed, airtight &quot;well&quot; — this regional specialty is called &quot;kuyu kebabı&quot; in Turkish. A little water added to a tray ensures that steam keeps the meat moist throughout the cooking process.

Produces around 200 tons of pastırma each year, çemen is made using garlic that is locally produced by the farming villages of Taşköprü.

==Economic history==
In the early 20th century, nickel was mined in the area around Kastamonu.

==Education==
Kastamonu is home to Kastamonu University, which was established in 2006 by incorporating existing colleges, schools, and institutes that were previously under Ankara University and Gazi University. Notable high schools in Kastamonu are: &quot;Abdurrahman Paşa Lisesi&quot;, also known as Kastamonu Lisesi, the first modern high school that was established in Anatolia in late Ottoman Empire. Kastamonu Mustafa Kaya Lisesi, an Anatolian high school, one of the most successful high schools in Turkey outside Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir.

<text>Jean Jules Henri Mordacq (12 January 1868 – 14 April 1943) was a French general. During his early years as a captain he was the sabre champion of the French Army&#x27;s officer corps. In World War I, he was a frontline commander of initially the , then the 90th Brigade, and finally the , in the process being wounded twice on the battlefield. In 1918 and the Paris Peace Conference, he was a close aide to Clemenceau.

==Early career==
Mordacq&#x27;s military career began as a lieutenant in French Algeria before joining the Foreign Legion&#x27;s 1st Foreign Regiment in French Indochina in 1893. Fighting off the remaining pirates in Tonkin, he became an intelligence officer during the &quot;Colonnes du Nord&quot; in 1896 where he met Joseph Gallieni and Hubert Lyautey. He returned to Algeria for a year and then studied in Paris at the &quot;École de guerre&quot; to become a staff officer. He then became known for his military writing advocating reforms from the military schools to tactical warfare. He became chief of staff of Georges Picquart&#x27;s 10th Infantry Division. When Picquart became Secretary of War in Clemenceau&#x27;s first Government in 1906, he became very influential as Picquart&#x27;s right hand. He pushed for the nomination of former mentor Ferdinand Foch at the head of the &quot;École de guerre&quot; before becoming an instructor there in 1910. He gave there the first strategy course in France known as the &quot;Cours des maréchaux&quot; for it was only open to the top fifteen students at the &quot;École de guerre&quot;. He came back to the Office of war promoting further reforms. Then Secretary and former comrade at &quot;Saint-Cyr&quot; Adolphe Messimy nominated him Director-in-second and head of the military classes at the &quot;École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr&quot; in 1912. He trained the future lieutenants and captains who would lead the French units in combat at the start of World War I.

==First World War==

=== 1914 ===
In August 1914, Mordacq was chief of staff of general Archinard&#x27;s 1st Reserve Corps Group in the Eastern Army. When the Germans breached the French lines through Belgium, he asked for a frontline command and became commander of the famous . He immediately partook in the Battle of the Frontiers and his regiment participated in ending the German advance in the Vosges before the First Battle of the Marne led to the Race to the Sea. He then took command of the defence of Arras, the &quot;key to the sea&quot; and again halted the German advance there, which led to the front&#x27;s stabilisation and the start of trench warfare.

=== 1915 ===
Promoted to colonel, he took command of the 90th Brigade, within 45th Infantry Division (France), which witnessed on 22 April 1915 the first chemical attack in history. His troops stood firm in the following weeks and retook lost ground.

=== 1916 ===
He was made &quot;général de brigade&quot; in 1916 and led the , which fought in the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme.

=== 1917 ===
In early 1917, he led his division in the Champagne region and threw back the Germans back to their lines before the Chemin des Dames attack.

He was to command an infantry corps in Italy but was called in early November 1917 to become the military chief of staff in Clemenceau&#x27;s second government in what was to be nicknamed the &quot;Ministère de la Victoire&quot;.

==In government==
He proved himself essential to the French command&#x27;s reorganisation and was Clemenceau&#x27;s influential right-hand man (his main military advisor) from 1917 to 1920, thus participating extensively in the Allied victory of 1918.

In January 1920, he became commander of the 30th Infantry Corps occupying in Rhineland in Wiesbaden. He remained at his command until 1925 when he left the army, resenting the contemporary political and military leaders who alienated him for his criticism of the appeasement policy toward Germany and for his unrelenting loyalty to Clemenceau in 1920.

==Retirement==
From 1925 to his death in 1943, Mordacq wrote more than twenty books and published dozens of articles in influential reviews to promote Clemenceau and his actions in the troubled days from November 1917 to 1920, explaining the choices and reforms which were made in order to achieve military and political victory.

He criticised former friend Philippe Pétain&#x27;s promulgation of racial laws in 1941. Mordacq was found dead in the Seine under the Pont des Arts on 12 April 1943. The authorities at the time claimed this was the result of suicide.

His last literary work on World War I, part 4 in the series &quot;The Great Hours of War&quot;, titled, &quot;1917, The Year of Anguish&quot;, was released just after the onset of World War II, in 1940.

<text>Evelyn May Clowes, known by the pseudonym Elinor Mordaunt (7 May 1872 – 25 June 1942), was an English author, writer and traveller born in Nottinghamshire, England. Her travels included Mauritius and Australia; she undertook a wide variety of employment.

==Early life==
Mordaunt was the fifth child of St. John Legh Clowes, a South African writer, and the Honourable Elizabeth Caroline Bingham. She was born in the village of Cotgrave, Nottinghamshire, and christened as Evelyn May Clowes. Her maternal grandfather was the Irish nobleman Denis Arthur Bingham, 3rd Baron Clanmorris. 

Growing up in genteel circumstances, her early childhood was spent at Charlton Down House near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and her teenage years near Heythrop in the Cotswolds. She was educated at home by governesses, excelling at German, Latin, Greek, shorthand writing, landscape painting, and fabric and wallpaper design.

==Australia==
In 1897 she went to Mauritius as companion to her cousin Caroline (wife of Sir George Le Hunte) and in 1898 married Maurice Wilhemn Wiehe, who owned a sugar plantation. She gave birth to two stillborn children. After a few years of marriage, she found it impossible to live with her husband and returned to England. Shortly afterwards she went to Australia, arriving 10 June 1902 and lived at Melbourne for about eight years. Her son, Godfrey Weston Wiehe, was born 9 March 1903. 

It was necessary for Mordaunt to earn a living and while in Melbourne she edited a woman&#x27;s fashion paper, wrote short stories and articles, made blouses, designed embroideries, tilled gardens, acted as a housekeeper, and did artistic work. Her health was not strong, but she undertook any kind of work which would provide a living for herself and her infant son. This gained her an experience of life which was of the greatest use to her as an author.

==Writings==

Mordaunt&#x27;s first book, the &quot;Garden of Contentment&quot;, was published in England in 1902 under her pen-name Elinor Mordaunt. At Melbourne she published a volume of sketches, &quot;Rosemary, That&#x27;s for Remembrance&quot; (1909), and in 1911 appeared &quot;On the Wallaby through Victoria&quot;, by E. M. Clowes, an interesting account of conditions in that state at that period. Returning to England on 14 July 1909 she soon began a long series of volumes of fiction. She changed her name by deed poll to Evelyn May Mordaunt on 1 July 1915 and gained a reputation as a writer of short stories for magazines. 

Mrs Mordaunt travelled in the East Indies and adjacent islands and used her experiences in her fiction, and in travel books such as &quot;The Venture Book&quot;, &quot;The Further Venture Book&quot;, and &quot;Purely for Pleasure&quot;. Her autobiography, &quot;Sinabada&quot;, published in 1937, includes an account of her early life in Australia with appreciative reference to the kindnesses she had received. Her son by her first marriage was alive when she was writing &quot;Sinabada&quot;; she mentions that he had married and had children. 

==Second marriage==
On 27 January 1933 at Tenerife, Canary Islands, she was married to Robert Rawnsley Bowles, aged 66, a retired barrister from Gloucestershire. In her own words, the marriage &quot;ended in tragedy.&quot;
==Death==
She died on 25 June 1942 at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. 

==Literary reputation==
Possibly her best work was put into her short stories, often showing a grim sense of tragedy and humour. A collection of them appeared in 1934, &quot;The Tales of Elinor Mordaunt&quot;. In addition to the volumes included in Miller, she was also the author of &quot;Death it is, Judge Not, Hobby Horse, Roses in December, Tropic Heat, Here Too is Valour&quot;, and &quot;Blitz Kids&quot;. Mordaunt was revealed as the author of a pseudonymous novel called &quot;Gin and Bitters&quot; (1931), referencing the debate in the London publishing world over whether Somerset Maugham had based the character of Alroy Kear in &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; on Hugh Walpole. The book was removed from sale in the UK, apparently under pressure from Maugham.

<text>The Freebooter of the Baltic (, 1857) is an early novel by the Swedish romantic novelist Viktor Rydberg. The adventure is set in 17th century Sweden and is a swashbuckling tale of piracy on the high seas, with political overtones. Several historical people are portrayed in the book, such as Bengt Skytte, Maria Skytte, Christina Anna Skytte and Gustav Skytte. 

The novel was translated into English by Caroline L. Broomall in 1891.

<text>Mikhail Mordkin (; December 9, 1880, Moscow, Russian Empire – July 15, 1944, New York) graduated from the Bolshoi Ballet School in 1899, and in the same year was appointed ballet master.

He joined Diaghilev&#x27;s ballet in 1909 as a leading dancer. After the first season he remained in Paris to dance with Anna Pavlova. He then formed his own company, the All Star Imperial Russian Ballet, which toured America in 1911 and 1912.

Mikhail returned to the Bolshoi and was appointed its director in 1917. He left Russia after the October Revolution, first working in Lithuania, and finally settling in the United States in 1924. He founded the Mordkin Ballet in 1926, for which he choreographed a complete &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and many other ballets. His company included such distinguished artists as Hilda Butsova, Felia Doubrovska, Pierre Vladimiroff, Vera Nemtchinova and Nicholas Zvereff. After a European tour the company disbanded in 1926.

Mordkin continued to be a freelance artist and teacher, including at the Cornish School in the 1920s. From among his students in America he formed a new Mordkin Ballet in 1937. Although he had been pushed into the background, Mordkin helped build the foundation for ballet in America including through the Mordkin Moser Conservatory whose alumni included Donald Heywood.

Mikhail Mordkin died in Millbrook, New York.

<text>Paul Elmer More (December 12, 1864 – March 9, 1937) was an American journalist, critic, essayist and Christian apologist.

==Biography==
Paul Elmer More, the son of Enoch Anson and Katherine Hay Elmer, was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was educated at Washington University in St. Louis and Harvard University. More taught Sanskrit at Harvard (1894-1895) and Bryn Mawr (1895-1897).

After his short career as an academic, he worked as a literary editor on &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. He started on his &quot;Shelburne Essays&quot; in 1904; they were to run to 11 published volumes, drawing on his periodical writing, and were followed later by the &quot;New Shelburne Essays&quot;, in three volumes from 1928.

In his literary criticism, More generally upheld the classical English authors who display, as he put it, a &quot;deep-rooted sense of moral responsibility&quot;—Shakespeare, Johnson, Trollope, Newman—while also accepting those lusty writers of France and America who cannot help but be a little too honest. As Francis X. Duggan notes, &quot;the immorality More most objects to, the most serious offence an artist can commit, is not the obvious one of obscenity or suggestiveness, but a falsification of human nature, the denial of moral responsibility&quot;.

He wrote several books after his retirement from journalism, including &quot;Platonism&quot; (1917); &quot;The Religion of Plato&quot; (1921); &quot;Hellenistic Philosophies&quot; (1923); and his last published work, the autobiographical &quot;Pages from an Oxford Diary&quot; (1937). His &quot;Greek Tradition&quot;, 5 vols. (1917–27), is generally thought to be his best work.

During the last 15 years of his life, More wrote several books of Christian apologetics, including &quot;The Christ of the New Testament&quot; (1924), &quot;Christ the Word&quot; (1927), and &quot;The Catholic Faith&quot; (1931). As Byron C. Lambert notes, &quot;More&#x27;s final mission was profoundly religious and what he wanted to leave to the world&quot;.

Nevertheless, although Russell Kirk judged him &quot;the twentieth century&#x27;s greatest apologist&quot;, More is little read by Christians today. In Lambert&#x27;s view, the reason is that More&#x27;s &quot;Christianity was altogether too idiosyncratic for most Christians&quot;. &quot;[T]oo exotic to be intelligible and too conditional to be authoritative&quot;, he lacked the power of &quot;unabashedly orthodox&quot; writers like C. S. Lewis or G. K. Chesterton &quot;to bring Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, and even fringe believers together in a way that is the surprise of divided Christendom&quot;.

That said, the man of whom Russell Kirk wrote, &quot;as a critic of ideas, perhaps there has not been his peer in England or America since Coleridge,&quot; has much to offer the discriminating Christian reader. Kirk cites, for instance, More&#x27;s insight into the &quot;enormous error&quot; of secular humanists. When the religious impulse is replaced by &quot;mere &#x27;brotherhood of man,&#x27; fratricide is not far distant.&quot; More wrote that the one effective way of &quot;bringing into play some measure of true justice as distinct from the ruthless law of competition...is through the restoration in the individual human soul of a sense of responsibility extending beyond the grave.&quot; The alternative is a society &quot;surrendered to the theory of ceaseless flux, with no principle of judgement except the shifting pleasure of the individual.&quot;

More saw the loss of Christian culture as entailing intellectual as well as moral collapse. He once remarked to Alfred Noyes that &quot;the ability to think clearly and deeply has been vanishing from all sections of the modern world except those that have some grasp of the philosophy of religion, as it has been developed through two thousand years in the central tradition of Christendom&quot;.

More collaborated with Irving Babbitt from before 1900 in the project later labelled New Humanism.

More lived in Princeton, New Jersey. He died on March 9, 1937, at the age of 72.

<doc id="837861" wikidata="Q1144073" url="?curid=837861" title="Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry">
<text>Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry (13 January 1750 – 28 January 1819), son of Bertrand-Médéric and Marie-Rose Moreau de Saint-Méry, was born in Fort-Royale, Martinique. He was a lawyer and writer with a career in public office in France, Martinique, and Saint-Domingue (now the Republic of Haiti). He is best known for his publications on Saint Domingue and Martinique. He married into a well-positioned family, which allowed him to expand his connections in France and in time be elected as a member of the Parliament of France. Moreau was deeply involved in the founding of the Museum of Paris, of which he was later appointed president in 1787.

==Education and influences==
Although he did not come from a family of significant means, Moreau used the inheritance he received from his grandfather to study law in Paris. There he argued that colonial law, drafted in France, was not fitting for the realities of the French Caribbean. He owned slaves, was a freemason and a member of the Cercle des Philadelphes – a colonial scientific society – and sought to document life in the colonies. He was influenced by the scientific projects of the Enlightenment.

==Writings==
Moreau produced in-depth studies of the colonies only years before St-Domingue&#x27;s revolution. As such, he spent time traveling in the Caribbean and returning to France to write and lobby until his involvement with the French Revolution led to the issuing of a warrant for his arrest. His most notable work, &quot;Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie française de l’isle Saint-Domingue&quot;, which he wrote in 1789, has not been fully translated into English. This work develops an arithmetic theory of skin color and the epidermis for the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). It hierarchizes a possible one hundred and twenty-eight possible combinations of black-white miscegenation into nine categories (the &quot;sacatra&quot;, the &quot;griffe&quot;, the &quot;marabout&quot;, the &quot;mulâtre&quot;, the &quot;quarteron&quot;, the &quot;métis&quot;, the &quot;mamelouk&quot;, the &quot;quarteronné&quot;, and the &quot;sang-melé&quot;). His work reflects a preoccupation of white colonists with racializing those who intermarry and interbreed with slaves or free &quot;gens de couleur&quot;, establishing the caste of white colonists as &quot;l&#x27;aristocratie de l’épiderme.&quot;

==Politics==
A well-educated slave owner, he rejected the principle of the Natural Rights of Man in order to defend legal slavery and segregation on the basis of race. In his roles in the French parliament and on the colonial Governing Boards, he sought to maintain an economic system based on slave labor. To this end, he pursued the rights of colonists – mostly white planters – and sought a degree of self-determination for the French Caribbean. Moreau returned to France in 1788, where he became part of the Estates General which later renamed themselves the National Assembly. There he represented the planters in Saint-Domingue and supported slavery, confronting the Society of the Friends of the Blacks. He had an important position in the founding of the Museum of Paris which he was later appointed president of in 1787. After his return to France in 1798, after his exile in the United States, Moreau&#x27;s first position was that of a historian in the Ministry of the Marine. A couple years later, in 1802 he became administrator of Parma, Piacenza, and Gustalla, but later on his position was taken away by Napoleon because of his forgiving response towards a criminal conspiracy among the army.

== Moreau in the United States ==
Moreau escaped Paris after a warrant for his arrest was issued in 1794. He relocated to Philadelphia after a short stay in New York City, leaving all his research on the Colony of Saint-Domingue behind, which he later was able to recover. In Philadelphia, he opened a bookstore in which he sold books and prints in many languages, as well as maps and music. The bookstore located at Front and Walnut became the meeting location for many other French exiles. Moreau became a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1798, to which he was committed, and introduced many of his émigré friends into the Society as well. Moreau had to flee back to Paris in 1798, escaping the Alien Bill imposed by the American president at the time, John Adams.

<doc id="837863" wikidata="Q76244" url="?curid=837863" title="Epica (band)">
<text>Epica is a Dutch symphonic metal band, founded by guitarist and vocalist Mark Jansen after his departure from After Forever.

Formed as a symphonic metal band with gothic tendencies, later Epica have incorporated into their sound strong death metal influences. Starting from the third album, progressive metal influences have also become evident. In addition, the band often uses thrash metal and groove metal riffs, black metal passages (mostly in the drum technique), power metal moments and references to Arabic music. Some songs also have electronic shades, djent transitions and folk metal melodies derived from Middle Eastern, Chinese and Celtic traditions. Epica is also known for the attention to the vocal lines that, in contrast to the heavy context, weave very catchy, easy to hold, sophisticated and emotional melodies. The use of soprano vocals and growled vocals, performed by Simone Simons and Mark Jansen respectively, is fundamental to the band&#x27;s sound. They primarily write their own lyrics, which often deal with philosophical, psychological, spiritual, moral, scientific, environmental, socio-political, global and topical and personal themes. Epica is also known for their wide use of orchestra and opera choirs.

In 2003, Epica&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Phantom Agony&quot; was released through Transmission Records. &quot;Consign to Oblivion&quot; followed in 2005, and debuted at No. 12 in the Dutch charts. They moved labels to Nuclear Blast following Transmission&#x27;s bankruptcy, and in 2007, released their third studio album &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot;, which charted at No. 9 in the Netherlands. 2009&#x27;s &quot;Design Your Universe&quot; was met with yet greater success, debuting at No. 8 in the Dutch Albums Chart, and charting across Europe, also garnering much critical acclaim. Epica&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Requiem for the Indifferent&quot; was released in 2012. Well received by critics, it achieved international success, entering the US&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 104, and Japan&#x27;s Oricon Albums Chart at No. 172.

At the beginning of May 2014 the band released their sixth album, &quot;The Quantum Enigma&quot;, which was a huge international success, debuting on No. 110 on US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and peaking at No. 4 in Epica&#x27;s homeland Netherlands. In June 2015 Epica was awarded the Music Export Awards, which is given to the Dutch act with the most international success in the past year. Their seventh album, &quot;The Holographic Principle&quot;, was released in September 2016 to continued international success, equalling the peak chart position set by its predecessor in the Netherlands. The band released their eighth album, &quot;Omega&quot;, in February 2021.

==History==
===&quot;Cry for the Moon&quot; (2002)===

In early 2002, at 23 years old, Mark Jansen left After Forever over creative differences. He then began looking for musicians who would work towards a more classical/symphonic type of music project; this was initially named Sahara Dust. In late 2002, the band courted Helena Iren Michaelsen (from Trail of Tears) as its frontwoman, but shortly after she was replaced by Simone Simons, who was Jansen&#x27;s girlfriend at the time. The band&#x27;s line-up was completed by guitarist Ad Sluijter, drummer Jeroen Simons, bassist Yves Huts, and keyboard player Coen Janssen. The name was later changed to Epica, inspired by Kamelot&#x27;s album of the same name.

Epica then assembled a choir (made up of two men and four women) and a string orchestra (three violins, two violas, two cellos and an upright bass) to play along with them. Still under the name &quot;Sahara Dust&quot;, they produced a two-song demo entitled &quot;Cry for the Moon&quot; in 2002. As a result, they were signed to Transmission Records.

===&quot;The Phantom Agony&quot; (2002–2004)===
&quot;The Phantom Agony&quot; is the first full-length studio album by Epica. It is the first album recorded by guitarist Mark Jansen after his departure from the band After Forever. The album was produced by Sascha Paeth (known for having produced bands such as Angra, Rhapsody of Fire and Kamelot) and released in June 2003. This album, Mark Jansen continues with the collection of songs that make up &quot;The Embrace That Smothers&quot;. The first three parts can be found on &quot;Prison of Desire&quot; (2000), After Forever&#x27;s debut album, and the following three parts can be found on &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot; (2007), Epica&#x27;s third album. These songs deal with the dangers of organized religion. The song &quot;Façade of Reality&quot; on the album was written about the September 11 attacks and includes fragments from speeches by Tony Blair.

The album was followed by three singles: “The Phantom Agony”, “Feint” and “Cry for the Moon”.

===&quot;Consign to Oblivion/The Score – An Epic Journey&quot; (2004–2006)===
Their second release, entitled &quot;Consign to Oblivion&quot;, was influenced by the culture of the Maya civilization, which can be noticed on songs in the &quot;A New Age Dawns&quot; series. &quot;A New Age Dawns&quot; refers to the time system of the Mayan people, which extends up to 2012, and makes no reference of what may happen past said year. &quot;Consign to Oblivion&quot; was composed with film scores as a basis, with Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman cited as major inspirations. The album features guest singing by Roy Khan (from Kamelot) on the song &quot;Trois Vierges&quot;. Epica also joined Kamelot as a support band on parts of their tour for promotion of &quot;The Black Halo&quot; album, to which Simons had contributed her vocals on the track &quot;The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)&quot;.
Two singles were released from the album, &quot;Solitary Ground&quot; and &quot;Quietus&quot;.

Epica&#x27;s non-metal album &quot;The Score – An Epic Journey&quot; was released in September 2005 and is the soundtrack for a Dutch movie called &quot;Joyride&quot;, though it could also be considered to be their third album. Mark Jansen describes the album as typical Epica, &quot;only without the singing, without the guitars, no bass and no drums&quot;.

In 2005 and 2006 Epica went on their first tour throughout North America with Kamelot. After the tour, drummer Jeroen Simons left the band because of his wish to pursue other musical interests. In Fall 2006, Simone once again contributed vocals to an album of Kamelot, this time on the tracks &quot;Blücher&quot; and &quot;Season&#x27;s End&quot; on the album &quot;Ghost Opera&quot;. In December, Ariën van Weesenbeek from God Dethroned was announced via Epica&#x27;s official website as the guest drummer for their new album, but not as a permanent band member.

===&quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot;/&quot;The Classical Conspiracy&quot; (2006-2009)===

In September 2007, Epica headlined their first tour through North America and released their third album, &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot;, this time on a new label, Nuclear Blast. That December, Ariën van Weesenbeek was announced to be Epica&#x27;s permanent new drummer. The band toured North America again in April 2008 with Into Eternity and Symphony X, this time with Amanda Somerville because Simone had contracted a staph infection (MRSA). It was released on 7 September 2007 through Nuclear Blast in Europe. The concept that guides the songs is that God created many different religions for humanity to figure out and overcome them so as to discover that, in nature and essence, they were all in fact the same one (hence the name, &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot;). Aside from the concept of such a conspiracy, &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot; finalizes The Embrace That Smothers, which began in After Forever&#x27;s &quot;Prison of Desire&quot; (Prologue and parts I-III) and continued in Epica&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom Agony&quot; (parts IV-VI). In short, The Embrace That Smothers is a collection of 10 songs (Prologue and parts I-IX), which talks about the dangers of organized religion.

The first single from the album was released on 10 August 2007 titled &quot;Never Enough&quot;, accompanied by a music video and the second single, &quot;Chasing the Dragon&quot;, was released in 2008 without an accompanying video.

On 16 December 2008, Ad Sluijter left the band. He left a message on his Myspace page with his reasoning for leaving the band, which included frustration over being unable to enjoy composing music because of deadlines. Ad&#x27;s successor on guitar was announced in January 2009 to be Isaac Delahaye, who was a member of God Dethroned.

Also in 2008, Epica recorded &quot;The Classical Conspiracy&quot;, their first live album. The live show took place in Miskolc, Hungary on 14 June 2008, in the framework of the Miskolc Opera Festival (where Therion did a similar show a year before). It included a 40-piece orchestra and a 30-piece choir, and the setlist contained not only the band&#x27;s songs but also covers of classical pieces of Antonio Vivaldi, Antonín Dvořák, Giuseppe Verdi, Edvard Grieg, and of soundtracks of the movies Star Wars, Spider-Man and Pirates of the Caribbean. It was released on 8 May 2009 through Nuclear Blast Records.

===&quot;Design Your Universe&quot; (2008-2010)===


On 4 March 2009, Epica announced their return to the studio where they would begin the recording process for a new album. In April 2009, it was revealed that the new album&#x27;s title would be &quot;Design Your Universe&quot;. It continued the A New Age Dawns saga, which started on &quot;Consign to Oblivion&quot;. The album was released on 16 October 2009. To promote this release, they performed in Amsterdam at Paradiso on 10 October 2009. This is the first Epica album to feature Isaac Delahaye. The record also contains a guest appearance from Sonata Arctica vocalist Tony Kakko on the song &quot;White Waters&quot;. Reception has been positive from both critics and fans. The album debuted in No. 8 in the Dutch charts, being the highest position an Epica album has reached. The album remained on the chart for five weeks and re-entered in No. 94 for one week due to the band&#x27;s performance at the 2010 Pinkpop Festival. On 31 December 2009, it was announced through their website that a single would be released. The song is called &quot;This Is the Time&quot; and all profits went to World Wide Fund for Nature. After the release of Design Your Universe, Epica set out on a World Tour to support the album. They did a CD release party at The Paradiso in Amsterdam. They performed at some summer festival concerts in the summer of 2010 and returned to the United States and Canada in late fall 2010. Several dates in Europe, especially in the Netherlands, were sold out. The band also did a South American Tour, performing in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Uruguay. They played also in many important rock and metal festivals in Europe, such as Wacken Open Air, Pinkpop and Masters of Rock, in front of very large audiences.

===&quot;Requiem for the Indifferent&quot; and &quot;Retrospect&quot; (2011–2013)===
In an interview in November 2010, Simone stated that the band was going to start writing music around February 2011 after their Latin American tour is over. She also stated that they were hoping for a release in the first quarter of 2012. 14 tracks were written without lyrics by May 2011. The band entered the studio later that year, with Sascha Paeth once again as the producer.

On December 1, the band announced that the name of the album would be &quot;Requiem for the Indifferent&quot;, and would be inspired by such factors as the enormous tension between different religions and cultures, wars, natural disasters and the financial crisis. The album was released on 9 March 2012 in Europe, and on 13 March 2012 in the United States. On 25 March 2012, Epica announced on their website that original bassist Yves Huts and Epica had parted ways, to be replaced by Rob van der Loo (ex-Delain, MaYaN). On April 24, the music video of &quot;Storm the Sorrow&quot; was officially released, earning 128,000 views on YouTube on the release day. General response to &quot;Requiem for the Indifferent&quot; was positive. AllMusic stated that the album &quot;is a typically elaborate and ambitious affair, incorporating copious amounts of choral work and classical arrangements into the band&#x27;s neatly established blend of goth, progressive, power, and symphonic metal.&quot; Natalie Zed of About.com staff considered &quot;Requiem for the Indifferent&quot; &quot;a transitional album for the band&quot;, which tries to expand their musical range experimenting with &quot;weird&quot; riffing and new combination of vocals, while &quot;losing none of the richness that has gained them fans.&quot;

On 16 September 2012, the band made a guest appearance on the Dutch TV show &quot;Niks te gek&quot; (translation: &quot;Nothing [is] too crazy&quot;), where mentally disabled people (18 years or older) can get their wishes granted. In the episode, they recorded, together with the autistic Ruurd Woltring, one of his own compositions, &quot;Forevermore&quot;. The single was released through Nuclear Blast on 25 September 2012.

The band announced on their official website that on 23 March 2013, they would celebrate the 10th anniversary of Epica in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The concert which would be called Retrospect, would be held in Klokgebouw with a 70-piece orchestra, choirs, international guests and many special effects. The band invited the Hungarian Remenyi Ede Chamber Orchestra and the Choir of Miskolc National Theatre to this show as they were the same orchestra that accompanied Epica in the recording of the live album The Classical Conspiracy. The concert consisted of a 70-piece orchestra, special effects, acrobats, guest vocalist Floor Jansen (Nightwish) and former band members Ad Sluijter, Yves Huts and Jeroen Simons. Finnish singer Tarja Turunen was also invited to the show, but had to decline due to scheduling problems. In the show the band introduced a new song titled &quot;Retrospect&quot; and played &quot;Twin Flames&quot; from Requiem for the Indifferent for the first time. They also played for the second time their longest song &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot;, however a shorter version of this song was played. During the concert, Coen Janssen announced that Retrospect would be filmed for release as a DVD.

===&quot;The Quantum Enigma&quot; and Epic Metal Fest (2013–2015)===

Epica revealed on their official website the first details about their sixth album on 5 February 2014. It was revealed that the new album would be titled &quot;The Quantum Enigma&quot; and would be released at the beginning of May 2014. Later that same month the band unveiled the album&#x27;s cover art, which was created by longtime collaborator Stefan Heilemann to accompany the ideas behind the lyrics. Track listing and release dates were announced the same day as well and eventually The Quantum Enigma was released by Nuclear Blast on 2 May (Europe), 5 May (UK) and 13 May (USA). The album was produced by Joost van den Broek and recorded in the Sandlane Recording Facilities in The Netherlands. The Quantum Enigma debuted at 110 on US Billboard 200, making it Epica&#x27;s second entry on this chart, the previous being Requiem for the Indifferent and charting there in February 2013. In Epica&#x27;s home country the Netherlands, the album peaked at No. 4 making it their highest ranking album on the chart.

The band stated that, &quot;Where Retrospect reflected on the first decade of our career, we&#x27;d like to think The Quantum Enigma marks the beginning of a new era, where Epica sounds heavy, modern and without compromises! More than ever, the creation of this album was a group effort and we are extremely proud of the results! Every detail finds its way into a perfectly balanced mix, and makes Epica sound raw and overwhelming.&quot;

On 17 March 2014 the first single, &quot;The Essence of Silence&quot; was made available as a digital download from iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, Deezer and other platforms. Three days later a lyric video was released. &quot;Unchain Utopia&quot; was chosen as the second single and released on 8 April 2014. In an interview with the Sonic Cathedral Webzine, lead vocalist Simone Simons confirmed that a music video for &quot;Unchain Utopia&quot; was set to be released soon. However, a lyric video was released instead, which features footage originally filmed for the music video. Later on the band decided to film a music video for the track &quot;Victims of Contingency&quot;, which was released on 30 October 2014.

The band returned to the stage after almost a year on 30 April 2013, in Tilburg in their home country, The Netherlands, which marked the album release show. Throughout 2014 and 2015 the band toured Europe, Asia, Africa and both South and North America in support of The Quantum Enigma. Their last venue before going back to studio took place on 22 November 2015 at the &quot;Klokgebouw&quot; in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, where Epica had held their Retrospect venue. The show was part of the first edition of &quot;Epic Metal Fest&quot;, which is a festival organized and curated by the members of the band. Epica announced Epic Metal Fest on 3 June 2015 on their official website and revealed that they would be joined at the festival by bands DragonForce, Eluveitie, Fear Factory, Moonspell, Delain and Periphery. The frontwoman Simone Simons further commented: &quot;It was a long-cherished dream of Epica to host our own festival and we are very proud to be able to present an absolute awesome array of international metal acts. This day will surely be the next highlight in our career and we hope to be able to share it with all of you!&quot;

On 5 June 2015 Epica was awarded the Music Export Award at Buma Rocks, which is given to the Dutch act with the most international success in the past year. The band&#x27;s guitarist/vocalist Mark Jansen thanked band&#x27;s fans through their official website: &quot;We are honored with this prestigious award, it’s a big achievement after all those years of investing countless hours and much energy into Epica. It shows that everything you do by following your heart will eventually pay off and will get acknowledged. Thanks to all our fans from all over the world!&quot;

===&quot;The Holographic Principle&quot;, EPs, first book and &quot;Design Your Universe&quot; 10th Anniversary (2016–2019)===

On 31 May 2016 Epica confirmed the title of the band&#x27;s new album: The Holographic Principle, that was released on 30 September 2016. In an interview with Spark TV the band&#x27;s singer Simone Simons discussed the complex nature of the album, explaining that the band used more &quot;real, live instruments&quot; than in previous albums and that this album is &quot;one of [the band&#x27;s] most ambitious offerings to date&quot;. The band announced previously that the album would be released as part of their performance at the second edition of Epic Metal Fest, but later revised this, stating it would be released a day earlier.

On 1 September 2017, the band released their first EP &quot;The Solace System&quot; during the second North American leg of the tour. The EP features 6 songs that were planned and recorded but never included in &quot;The Holographic Principle&quot;.

Epica released an EP on 20 December 2017, in Japan titled &quot;Epica vs Attack on Titan Songs&quot;, featuring covers of songs from the anime &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;. The EP was released worldwide on 20 July 2018.

On 3 July 2019, Epica announced that they would release their first book later that year. This would include a history of the band, interviews and photos.

The band announced on 17 July 2019 that a Gold Edition of their album &quot;Design Your Universe&quot; would come out on 4 October 2019 in support of its tenth anniversary, along with a tour.

===&quot;Omega&quot;, &quot;The Alchemy Project&quot; and &quot;Aspiral&quot; (2020–present)===

Simone Simons had stated on 1 February 2020 that pre-production for the next album had been completed. On 11 March 2020, the band had entered the studio to begin recording their new album, while in turn released studio vlogs showing the album making process for their upcoming eighth studio album. Mark Jansen had said in an interview that the album&#x27;s release date could be delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported that on 17 April 2020 that Simone Simons had finished recording vocals for the new album. Mark Jansen later confirmed on 2 September 2020 that the album had been recorded, mixed and mastered with orchestrations and choir having been wrapped up before the band began recording.

Nuclear Blast later announced on 7 October 2020 the title for the band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Omega&quot;, along with a release date of 26 February 2021. On 9 October 2020, the first single off of the album, &quot;Abyss of Time – Countdown to Singularity&quot;, was released with an official videoclip. The second single from the album, &quot;Freedom – The Wolves Within&quot;, was released on 27 November 2020 along with a music video. The third single, &quot;Rivers&quot;, was released on 22 January 2021 along with a visualizer video. In support of the album, the band performed a livestream event titled &quot;Omega Alive&quot;, which took place on 12 June 2021 and was released on several audio and video formats on 3 December 2021.

On 16 September 2022, the band announced their third EP, &quot;The Alchemy Project&quot;, a collaborative effort with each song featuring at least one guest artist. It was released on 11 November 2022 via Atomic Fire. It was accompanied by official music videos for the songs &quot;The Final Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Sirens – Of Blood and Water&quot;. In May 2023, Epica was chosen to open for Metallica with Ice Nine Kills for a short run of shows in Paris and Hamburg on their M72 World Tour, replacing Five Finger Death Punch, who had cancelled their appearances due to health issues. On 7 November 2023, the band announced &quot;The Symphonic Synergy&quot;, a set of four special shows with an orchestra and a choir that is set to take place in both Amsterdam on 19 and 20 September 2024, and Mexico City on 6 and 7 December 2024.

Simons stated in an interview in March 2024, that the ninth studio album was in production, and estimated that the album would be released in 2025. The album &quot;Aspiral&quot; was announced on 30 January 2025, coinciding with the release of the new single &quot;Cross the Divide&quot; and following the release of the single &quot;Arcana&quot;.

==Musical style==

Epica performs a blend of symphonic metal, gothic metal, progressive metal, death metal and, more rarely, thrash metal, power metal and folk metal.

Their former guitarist Ad Sluijter having described the band as &quot;a bridge between power metal and gothic metal.&quot; Vocalist Simone Simons has expressed a preference for the group to be described as symphonic metal though the founder of the group Mark Jansen notes that they do not mind being called gothic metal. Mark Jansen having described the band also as &quot;symphonic death metal&quot; and a bridge between death metal and symphonic metal.

The music of Epica is &quot;epic, grand and majestic&quot; and some of them is &quot;more subdued and introspective.&quot; The band is also known to have progressive tendencies. A gothic atmosphere and sentimentality is also present in their music.

Epica uses a &quot;trademark of many symphonic and gothic metal bands&quot; in contrasting &quot;two extremes, death grunts and brutality on one side, airy female melodiousness on the other.&quot; Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic notes that the band&#x27;s &quot;attraction ultimately hinges on exploring the sonic contrasts of light and dark; the punishing intensity of those elephantine guitar riffs and hyperactive drumming cast against the soaring, layered sweetness of the orchestrated strings and keyboards.&quot; Simone Simons delivers classical (operatic) vocals in a mezzo-soprano range, she&#x27;s begun to sing in a more modern style with belted vocals too (Rock/Pop, as she described it with the release of Consign to Oblivion on an interview) over time, and she has also been known to sometimes sing &quot;with a clear alto voice that has a flawless tone and a lot of emotion.&quot; But, subsequently, Simone admitted that she was wrong and that she&#x27;s not a mezzo-soprano, but a soprano. Mark Jansen delivers death growls &quot;that are secondary to Simons&#x27; singing, but very important in terms of balance and variety.&quot; The group is also known to employ human choirs and orchestras with additional embellishments such as spoken word recitals and lyrics in Latin and Arabic.

<text>Delfim Moreira da Costa Ribeiro (; 7 November 1868 – 1 July 1920) was a Brazilian politician who served as tenth president of Brazil.

==Biography==
He was born in Minas Gerais state to a Portuguese father and to a Portuguese Brazilian mother who traced her ancestry back to the early settlers of Brazil.

Delfim Moreira, elected vice president under Rodrigues Alves in 1918, provisionally ruled the country as the Brazilian Constitution provided for new elections in case of disability of the president before completing two years in office. Rodrigues Alves never even entered office, for he was stricken by the &quot;Spanish flu&quot; and died on 16 January 1919. Delfim Moreira himself also did not have good health, suffering from some psychological conditions, therefore his short tenure was known as &quot;the republican regency&quot; since the government Minister of Transportation and Public Works, Afrânio de Melo Franco, stood out in the president&#x27;s decision-making.

Three days after the new government took over the country, a general strike hit the capital and the city of Niterói. The president ordered the closure of unions in Rio de Janeiro, on 22 November.

On 21 June 1919, a dissident faction of the anarchists founded the Brazilian Communist Party. Four months later, the government expelled from the country about a hundred of them, mostly foreigners, who worked in the workers movement of the cities of São Paulo, Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Niterói, due to the discovery of an alleged plot aimed at overthrowing the government.

When Epitácio Pessoa was elected the new president, Moreira became his vice president. As vice president, he also served as the President of the Senate. He died in the city of Santa Rita do Sapucaí, on 1 July 1920. He was succeeded by Bueno de Paiva.

<doc id="837871" wikidata="Q311185" url="?curid=837871" title="Afonso Pena">
<text>Afonso Augusto Moreira Pena (30 November 1847 – 14 June 1909), often referred to as Afonso Pena, was a Brazilian lawyer, professor, and politician who served as the sixth president of Brazil, from 1906 until his death in 1909. Pena was elected in 1906, the chosen successor of president Rodrigues Alves. Pena was the first politician from Minas Gerais to win the presidency, ending the series of politicians from São Paulo who had held the presidency since 1894. Before his presidency, he served as the 4th vice president of Brazil, under Rodrigues Alves (1903–1906) after the death of Silviano Brandão. Pena was a monarchist. He was the only member of Emperor Pedro II&#x27;s cabinet to become president of Brazil and the first Brazilian president to die in office.

Pena was born in Santa Bárbara, Minas Gerais, in 1847. His father, Domingos José Teixeira Pena, was a Portuguese immigrant who owned slaves and a gold mine. After graduating with a law degree from the Faculty of Law of São Paulo and becoming a doctor at the same institution, Pena returned to his hometown, where he began to work as an attorney, later moving to Barbacena and becoming known for defending slaves. His political career began in 1874 when he joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the Provincial Assembly of Minas Gerais. In 1878, he was elected general deputy for Minas Gerais. In the succeeding years he reconciled legislative work with some periods occupying ministries—Ministry of War (1882), Agriculture (1883–1884), and Justice (1885).

After the proclamation of the Republic, Pena withdrew from public life; however, he was soon called upon to join the Republican Party of Minas Gerais (PRM) and run for the State Senate in order to help with the creation of the new state constitution. Pena was elected for the position in 1891 and presided over the commission that was tasked with drafting the constitution. After resigning his position in the Senate, Pena was elected president of Minas Gerais by consensus of the several political currents in the state, serving from 1892 to 1894. It was during his administration that Belo Horizonte was established as the future state capital (which at that time was Ouro Preto) and the Faculty of Law of Minas Gerais was founded. After presiding over the Bank of the Republic from 1895 to 1898, Pena became vice president to Rodrigues Alves in 1903. As vice president, he also served as president of the Senate.

Pena became president of Brazil in 1906 after an uncontested single-candidate election. He was the first Brazilian president to advocate intervening in the coffee economy, putting into practice the Taubaté Agreement, after which the federal government began to buy production surplus in order to maintain the high price of coffee in international markets. Pena&#x27;s government promoted the expansion of railways and immigration, the modernization and reorganization of the Brazilian Army with the introduction of the Sortition Law, and the rearmament of the Brazilian Navy, with the acquisition of new ships. Pena also supported Cândido Rondon&#x27;s expeditions in the Amazon rainforest, which linked it to Rio de Janeiro by telegraph. In the international sphere, Brazil took part in the Hague Convention of 1907, with a delegation led by Ruy Barbosa, and solved its border issues with neighboring countries. Tensions with Argentina reached a peak due to Brazil&#x27;s acquisition of the &quot;Minas Geraes&quot;-class battleships, which provoked the South American dreadnought race, and both countries hovered on the brink of war. In his final years in the presidency, Pena unsuccessfully tried to nominate David Campista as his successor. Pena died from severe pneumonia in 1909, being succeeded by Nilo Peçanha.

== Early life and education ==
Born on 30 November 1847 in Santa Bárbara do Mato Dentro—currently the municipality of Santa Bárbara, Minas Gerais—Afonso Pena was the seventh of twelve children of Domingos José Teixeira Penna and Anna Moreira Teixeira Penna; being his mother&#x27;s firstborn, as she was his father&#x27;s second wife. Domingos was a Portuguese immigrant from São Salvador da Ribeira de Pena (also spelled &quot;da Penha&quot; or &quot;Peña&quot;) and in the new country he owned land, a gold mine, and a large number of slaves. Domingos&#x27; father, Manuel José de Carvalho Penha (b. 1769), was supposedly the first to adopt the name &quot;Pena&quot;.

While initially following a military career in the , Domingos later abandoned it; his earnings were sufficient to provide the family with a standard of living described as &quot;comfortable&quot;. Afonso&#x27;s mother came from an influential family in Santa Bárbara politics. Thus, Afonso&#x27;s family was part of Minas Gerais&#x27; elite. As a child, he was taken care of by the nursemaid Ambrosina, a slave. Pena would often accompany his father to the gold mines in Brumado and São Gonçalo do Rio Abaixo. According to José Anchieta da Silva, Pena was an early abolitionist who fought for better working conditions for his father&#x27;s slaves; on one occasion, upon seeing a pregnant slave working in a mine, Pena spoke to the overseer, after which it was decided that pregnant slaves would no longer work in the mines from the sixth month of pregnancy onwards, and their only task would be &quot;to cook or wash clothes&quot;.

After receiving his first schooling at his mother&#x27;s house from private tutors, Pena went on to study at the in 1857, at the age of ten. The school, isolated from major urban centers, was maintained by the Lazarist priests, and Pena&#x27;s father was one of its most prominent creditors. At the school, he had theology, ethics, philosophy, mathematics, geometry, history, rhetoric, and foreign language classes. Pena finished his studies in the Caraça School on 16 January 1864 and later moved to the city of São Paulo to study at the Faculty of Law in 1866, which, together with the Faculty of Law of Recife, formed the country&#x27;s &quot;intelligentsia&quot; at the time.

=== At the Faculty of Law ===
During his studies at the Faculty of Law, Pena was a colleague of Ruy Barbosa, Bias Fortes, Joaquim Nabuco, Castro Alves, and Rodrigues Alves. In 1870 Pena became, alongside Rodrigues Alves, an editor in chief of the faculty&#x27;s journal &quot;Imprensa Acadêmica&quot; after a close election. There was supposed to be only one editor in chief, but the election unexpectedly ended in a tie. It was then agreed to include both Pena and Alves as chief editors. The journal, focused on debating academic and political issues, was influenced by French authors such as Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac, and Émile Zola.

Although not a freemason, in the Faculty of Law he joined the —a secret student society of a liberal, abolitionist, and republican nature, which was inspired by the German Burschenschaft associations and founded by professor Julius Frank—and became chief of &quot;Bucha&quot; &quot;General Communion&quot;. This association helped students that could not afford to pay for their studies. Pena maintained contact with other &quot;Bucha&quot; members, even after finishing his studies at the faculty.

Pena was an adept of natural law and an opponent of positivism, as he was a fervent Catholic and sympathetic to the monarchy in Brazil. His ideas distanced him from the Brazilian positivists, who defended the separation of Church and State and the creation of a military republic in the country. Two other movements divided Brazil during his years at the Faculty of Law: abolitionism and republicanism. Pena supported the former but not the latter, refusing to sign the , as he considered Brazil was not ready for a regime change.

=== Early law career ===
Pena graduated with a Law degree on 23 October 1870. He became a Doctor of Law at the same institution on 29 August 1871 – the only one in his class – after defending his thesis &quot;Letra de Câmbio&quot; on 19 June of that year. Upon receiving his doctorate, Pena gave a speech in which he expressed his abolitionist thoughts, concluding that &quot;the entire country is agitated to solve, in accordance with the principles of justice, the great question of the centuries – the emancipation of an enslaved race&quot;. After turning down an invitation to teach at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, he returned to Minas Gerais, where he began to work as a lawyer, at first practicing law in his hometown and later in Barbacena.

There he became known for advocating in defense of slaves and even for helping them escape, for which he came close to being denounced on the court in Rio de Janeiro by a local military officer. Despite this, he was concerned with the economic effects the immediate abolition of slavery could cause; for this reason, he was in favor of compensating slave owners after abolition and also supported immigration as a way to replace slave labor. This brought him closer to other politicians of his time, especially the conservatives, who, according to Cláudia Viscardi, were &quot;responsible for the progressive delay of the end of slavery in Brazil&quot;.

=== Marriage and family ===
Afonso Pena married on 23 January 1875. The couple went on their honeymoon to Rio de Janeiro, where they met emperor Pedro II. Guilhermina was the daughter of João Fernandes de Oliveira Pena, the Viscount of Carandaí, and the niece of Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão, the Marquis of Paraná, one of the most prominent politicians in the Empire of Brazil. They had nine children, including Afonso Júnior, who was later Minister of Justice and Internal Affairs to president Artur Bernardes and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, and , an engineer who carried out several public works in Rio de Janeiro, including the landfill that gave rise to the Urca neighborhood.

Pena inherited properties from his parents, including a gold mine, which he sold by the end of the 19th century, as its gold production had declined. He also had a textile factory, which he sold in the 1900s, as well as several investments in Brazil and abroad. In order to better manage his investments, Pena was helped by João Ribeiro de Oliveira Sousa, who became president of Crédito Real, then Minas Gerais&#x27; largest bank, on Pena&#x27;s recommendation.

== Political rise ==

=== Parliamentarian (1874–1882) ===
Afonso Pena joined the Liberal Party in 1874, beginning his political career that same year and being elected provincial deputy to the 20th legislature in Minas Gerais. He remained in this office until 1878, being successively reelected to the 21st (1876–1877) and 22nd (1878–1879) legislatures, when he was elected general deputy, beginning his term in the Chamber of Deputies in the 17th legislature (1878–1881). Pena&#x27;s political career was initially sponsored by Martinho Campos and Afonso Celso, two prominent politicians who helped him in his rise in the Liberal Party.

The liberals&#x27; rise to power in 1878 came after a decade in ostracism (the so-called ), being tasked by the emperor with carrying out an electoral reform to establish direct voting. The party&#x27;s rise to power had not occurred on its own merit, and Pena alerted his companions to its unstable position. The new liberal prime minister, João Lins Cansanção, was out of step with the party&#x27;s main current, leaving a pessimistic impression on Pena. The issue of direct voting, the main point of the liberal program, was the subject of debates about which path should be adopted: a constitutional reform or the approval of an ordinary law. Most liberals were in favor of a constitutional reform, which would imply deliberation of the issue by the Senate, where there was a conservative majority. Pena was against this path, joining a dissident wing within the party.

Cansanção fell on 28 March 1880, as desired by Pena. His successor, also liberal José Antônio Saraiva, then decided to carry out the electoral reform by means of an ordinary law. The Saraiva Law, as it became known, was finally approved on 9 January 1881, introducing direct vote in Brazil, the voter&#x27;s license, and allowing non-Catholics to vote. The number of electors in the country was expected to grow considerably, giving more legitimacy to elections. However, on 13 August 1881, shortly before the next elections, an executive decree was issued regulating the issuance of the voter&#x27;s license by introducing a number of requirements, including literacy, and so the number of people eligible to vote fell considerably. The prime minister who followed, Martinho Campos, also a liberal, despite declaring himself a &quot;slaveholder to the core&quot;, did not seek to advance the liberal agenda, but attempted to revise the electoral regulation in order to expand the electorate, which led to his fall by a motion of no confidence. Dissatisfied with the reduction in the number of voters, Pena later criticized the law, declaring that &quot;an electorate of 142,000 citizens cannot be the electorate of this Empire, which has 12 million inhabitants&quot;.

=== Minister of State (1882–1885) ===
In 1882, Pena took a leave of absence from his position as general deputy, beginning his experience in executive positions after being appointed Minister of War in the cabinet of prime minister Martinho Campos at the age of 35. Pena was one of only two civilians to hold the office, the other being . Despite being a civilian, he was well received by the military, as he defended their freedom of speech and military reforms, which included the army&#x27;s professionalization. Pena was successively reelected to the 18th (1881–1884), 19th (1885), and 20th (1886–1889) legislatures in the Chamber of Deputies. During this period, he defended the increase of municipal autonomy, progressively aligning himself with political and economic liberalism, for which he also supported the non intervention of the State in the economy.

In the following years, he was Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Public Works in the cabinet of Lafayette Rodrigues (1883–1884), and Interior and Justice in the cabinet of José Antônio Saraiva (1885). As Minister of Justice, Pena entirely reformed the police and improved the prison system; in this office he was also one of signatories of the Saraiva-Cotegipe Law, which granted freedom to slaves aged 60 and over. However, he reinforced the capture of fugitive slaves and prosecuted the abolitionists who helped them. Saraiva fell on 20 August 1885, being succeeded by the conservative João Maurício Vanderlei, the Baron of Cotegipe, thus ending seven years of liberal rule (the ) and Pena&#x27;s stay in the executive.

=== In the opposition (1886–1889) ===
Cotegipe dissolved the liberal chamber and called for new elections, which were held on 15 January 1886. Afonso Pena was elected in his 3rd district with 615 votes out of 863 electors. Minas Gerais elected 11 liberals out of 20 deputies, the largest liberal caucus in the Chamber of Deputies. In opposition, Pena became a staunch critic of the government, monitoring and analyzing all its actions: the signing of railway contracts, public works, the soil examination in Rio de Janeiro, etc. In Américo Lacombe&#x27;s words, everything was &quot;examined and debated&quot;. 

By 1886, however, the main issue was the so-called &quot;Military Question&quot;, a series of incidents that began in 1884 between the military and the civilian authorities. News of the incidents was alarming. On 30 September, Pena requested explanations about an incident in Rio Grande do Sul, where officers and students from the Military School demanded that the provincial president, Deodoro da Fonseca, fire a teacher from the Normal School who was the editor of a newspaper. Fonseca complied. Despite being a monarchist, he was gradually being co-opted by republicans. Pena did not understand Cotegipe&#x27;s attitude towards the incidents. The prime minister believed that repressive measures would be inappropriate. For Pena, however, Cotegipe&#x27;s passivity encouraged military insubordination. By 1887, the military and republicans were openly plotting a coup d&#x27;état.

Pena&#x27;s stance on slavery became ambiguous. It is not known for certain whether he owned slaves. His political prominence made him abandon his youthful abolitionist ideals, as he became increasingly concerned with the economic impacts of abolition and sought to be loyal to his party. Pena went along with his party in parliamentary debates regarding slavery; Minas Gerais&#x27; politicians feared abolition could harm the province&#x27;s economy, which largely relied on coffee. In any case, he later voted in favor of the Golden Law, which finally abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888, but expressed his concerns regarding the effects the law would have. On 24 October, in a long speech criticizing the João Alfredo cabinet, which had succeeded Cotegipe, Pena examined the consequences of abolition and drew attention to the rise of republicanism among the conservative classes, as &quot;it is certain that many see in the new regime a means of extorting the compensation [for their freed slaves] that they were unable to obtain under this regime&quot;.

=== Fall of the empire ===

João Alfredo was succeeded by Afonso Celso on 7 June 1889, thus ending Pena&#x27;s stay in the opposition. Due to his proximity to Afonso Celso, Pena had been appointed a member of the by emperor Pedro II the previous year. Despite criticizing nominations based on political affinity, even committing himself to fighting them, Pena could not detach himself from it, so as to not harm his political career. The liberals, now once again in power, had met on 23 May 1889 in the headquarters of the newspaper &quot;Tribuna Liberal&quot; where they devised a broad reforms program and were determined to carry it out. It included turning the country into a federal monarchy and the adoption of a civil code, as the country lacked one. As was usual, the new prime minister dissolved the chamber of deputies and called for new elections.

In order to draft the country&#x27;s first civil code, the government created a commission and Pena was appointed one of its members. Pena wrote the chapter pertaining to inheritance. The success in the elections encouraged Afonso Celso, who was oblivious to the growing deterioration in the military situation. Landowners had withdrawn their support to the government &quot;en masse&quot; after abolition and the prime minister drew up a loan plan for agriculture in an attempt to gain their sympathy. Afonso Celso defined his program as &quot;making the Republic useless&quot;. Taking advantage of high coffee prices and favorable results in the balance of payments, the minister embarked on an ambitious economic program. The idea was to modernize the country in an attempt to save the monarchy. 

Afonso Celso implemented a network of issuing banks, with the aim of stimulating the economy, which led to unbridled speculation, known as the &quot;Encilhamento&quot;. A large number of new companies was founded, whose capital almost reached that of all companies founded since the birth of the Brazilian Empire. In the words of Américo Lacombe, &quot;there was a terrible contrast between the government&#x27;s euphoria, celebrating the electoral victory and the liveliness of the business world. While the military class, especially the young ones, indoctrinated by the positivist agenda, were dissatisfied&quot;.

On the night of 14 November 1889, low-ranking officers and students from the rebelled. They left their barracks to attack the government. Afonso Celso took refuge in the Army Headquarters. At dawn on the 15th, the rebels went to get Benjamin Constant to lead them. Once informed of what was happening, Deodoro da Fonseca left his home, despite being seriously ill, and went to lead the troops, who positioned their cannons against the Army HQ. There was no resistance. A provisional government was organized at night. It was the end of the monarchy in the country and the beginning of the First Brazilian Republic. 

The work on the civil code was interrupted. That same day, Pena sent a telegram to Afonso Celso, who had been arrested, expressing his solidarity. Pena was pessimistic about the provisional government, later declaring &quot;what we have [now] is not a republic—it is pure militarism&quot;. After the republic was proclaimed, he returned to Barbacena and withdrew from public life, saddened by the . He thought about abandoning politics to resume his law career. Like many other monarchist politicians of his time, he ended up adopting a &quot;resigned acceptance&quot; to the new regime, as he feared any reaction could lead to a civil war. Pena remained a convinced monarchist and continued to defend the emperor, whom he considered to be a man of &quot;great knowledge and deeds&quot;. He had become one of the most prestigious politicians of the Empire.

=== State Senator (1891) ===
The new republican government, headed by Deodoro da Fonseca, appointed Cesário Alvim as president of Minas Gerais. Alvim had not joined the republican movement until late, which caused dissatisfaction among Minas Gerais&#x27; so-called &quot;historical republicans&quot;, who felt betrayed. Pena&#x27;s retirement from politics, however, did not last long: as he was famous for being a conciliatory politician, he was invited by the newly founded Republican Party of Minas Gerais (PRM) to be a candidate for the , and help the Minas Gerais&#x27; Constituent Assembly, in 1891.

Pena was then elected for the 1st legislature in the state&#x27;s senate (1891–1895), helping in Minas Gerais&#x27; transition from province to state by ameliorating its political conflicts and presiding over the commission that was tasked with drafting the state&#x27;s constitution. As president of the commission, Pena opposed an initial constitutional draft sent to the assembly by the state government, as he deemed it a centralizing one; he argued that the draft should be rejected as it was &quot;inspired by a unitary political model, like the monarchical regime that had just failed&quot;. The constitutional draft provided for the election of the governor by the state congress and the election to the senate by a &quot;special electorate&quot;, which Pena opposed. The very existence of the Minas Gerais senate, thus forming a bicameral legislature, was disputed, with being its biggest opponent. Campista accused the senate of &quot;disguising aristocratic tendencies&quot;. In response, Afonso Pena argued that the senate was a &quot;moderating power&quot; and perfected the legislative process, without which the lower house would &quot;reach omnipotence&quot;.

The final constitutional draft, promulgated on 15 June 1891 with several amendments proposed by Pena, granted more autonomy for the municipalities, as he had envisioned years before, and established a bicameral legislature, with the senators being elected by direct vote; it also provided for the creation of a new state capital to replace Ouro Preto. The change of the capital from Ouro Preto was the most controversial point; Pena was in favor of moving the capital and proposed to postpone the decision until a commission of specialists presented the new possible locations. During his speeches in the constituent assembly, Pena had assumed a conciliatory tone with the more radical republican wings and the old monarchists, who fiercely debated the issue.

As state senator, Pena also clashed with the Leopoldina Railway Company, which was the largest railway in Minas Gerais, approving a measure that forced the company to abide by its contract duties or else lose its concession to operate. He also proposed that members of the judiciary be appointed through public competition, instead of according to political adherence, as had been the case until then; this stance was in line with his preference for personal ability instead of nominations being political, although it is not possible to say he did not made nominations based on political criteria rather than individual merit during his political career. This preference would be reflected in his cabinet when president years later.

Pena defended the expansion of railways in Minas Gerais and the organization of public education. He was against what he called &quot;empregomania&quot;, that is, students&#x27; excessive preference, at the time, for public jobs, which consumed public finances. This was also the opinion of other politicians at the time. For this reason, he defended technical education. In his own words:

=== President of Minas Gerais (1892–1894) ===

==== The threatened republic ====


The first years of the republic in Brazil were plagued by disputes and political instability. The Brazilian Empire had been overthrown in a bloodless military coup, but the next decade was a bloody one. Deodoro da Fonseca on 3 November 1891 and Pena resigned his position in the state senate in protest, arguing that &quot;the coexistence of constitutional powers with the state of dictatorship proclaimed by president Deodoro da Fonseca was incompatible&quot;. This act distanced him from Alvim and gave him the support of most of Minas Gerais&#x27; elite. Tensions were high in the federal government and Deodoro ended up resigning on 23 November 1891, being succeeded by vice president Floriano Peixoto.

Upon assuming government, Peixoto reconvened Congress and began a process of deposing the state governors who had supported Deodoro da Fonseca. Such a process could take place through a federal military intervention with the justification of guaranteeing law and order. In Minas Gerais, the position of Alvim, who had supported Deodoro, became untenable. Alvim faced constant pressure from the radical republicans, and even a separatist threat, when the city of Campanha, in southern Minas Gerais, proclaimed itself the capital of a new state, Minas do Sul. Knowing that a federal intervention would be inevitable, Alvim stepped forward and resigned in February 1892. Pena then emerged as the only one capable of restoring stability to the state, being chosen by consensus of its different political currents to succeed Alvim. Pena ran for president of Minas Gerais, on a single ticket, and became the first democratically elected president of the state by direct vote on 30 June 1892, with a total of 48 thousand votes. He took office on 14 July, succeeding , the last provisional president of Minas Gerais.

The legality of Floriano Peixoto&#x27;s position as president was questioned by civilians and high-ranking officers of the armed forces, who believed that new elections should be held. On 6 April 1892, 13 senior army and navy officers published calling for new elections. Peixoto&#x27;s reaction was brutal. The president dismissed the officers, decreed a state of emergency, suspended constitutional guarantees, deported his enemies to remote regions in the country, and carried out mass arrests. Peixoto&#x27;s radical followers, known as Jacobins, could not stand seeing Minas Gerais outside the government&#x27;s influence and plotted Pena&#x27;s fall. Colonel , commander of the 31st battalion, intended to overthrow Pena and take over the state government. Aware of the plot and feeling his position threatened, Pena decided to send a letter to Peixoto, asking the president to directly intervene with the colonel. On 23 February 1893, Teles was transferred to Bagé, thus ending the threat.

On 2 February 1893, parallel to the events unfolding in the capital, a civil war broke out in Rio Grande do Sul under the leadership of Gaspar da Silveira Martins and Gumercindo Saraiva, against governor Júlio de Castilhos, the latter brought to power by Peixoto. Known as the Federalist Revolution, the rebels wanted to march north and reach São Paulo. Pena spoke out against the rebels and in favor of the government, with the aim of keeping Minas Gerais away from conflicts. As president of Minas Gerais, he opposed Peixoto&#x27;s authoritarianism and gave sanctuary to his opponents in the state, notably Olavo Bilac and Carlos de Laet. Laet, a fervent monarchist, praised Afonso Pena for not having allowed &quot;the Rio police to capture in the territory of Minas the Sebastianists [monarchists] hidden there&quot;. 

With the outbreak of the Second Naval Revolt on 6 September 1893, admiral Saldanha da Gama, the leader of the revolt, consulted the citizens as to whether they wanted the return of the monarchy or the maintenance of the republic; in response, Afonso Pena published his &quot;Manifesto dos Mineiros&quot; in the newspaper on 11 December, in which he declared:

Thus, despite housing several opponents of the federal government in his state, including monarchists and rebels, who fled persecution by the central government, and disapproving of Floriano Peixoto&#x27;s actions, Pena urged the people not to join the rebellion, siding with the president against it, as he deemed it necessary to maintain the country&#x27;s unity. He went as far as to offer the federal government the help of the Public Force of Minas Gerais, if necessary. This did not mean he supported Floriano Peixoto&#x27;s stay in power, as he wanted the country&#x27;s return to civilian rule. Once the naval revolt was defeated, Peixoto&#x27;s supporters plotted a coup d&#x27;état to keep him in power as a dictator. Pena sent a letter to the president, dated 23 January 1894, warning him of the need to ensure that the next elections took place normally. For Américo Lacombe, the letter had the tone of an ultimatum. In this sense, Pena supported the presidential candidacy of Prudente de Morais for the 1894 election, despite several calls for him to run in the elections. Morais won the election and became the first civilian president of Brazil. As a reward for his loyalty, Pena was given the rank of brigadier general by Peixoto. His actions also dissipated the threat of a federal intervention in Minas Gerais.

==== Foundation of the Faculty of Law ====
During his tenure as state president, Pena strengthened and reformed public education, creating several schools in the state&#x27;s interior, built railways, modernized the tax system, and promoted public debt amortization. He was also the founder of the Free Faculty of Law of Minas Gerais, in Ouro Preto, on 13 November 1892, being elected the Faculty&#x27;s first director, and was also a teacher at the institution, lecturing on financial sciences and public accounting. According to Luiz Arnaut, Pena &quot;used all the resources at his disposal to make the faculty viable. He ceded public buildings, set up committees in municipalities to raise funds, gave up his rest [time] as president of the State to prepare classes, as well as his pay for services provided to the faculty. The institution formally began to function on 2 January 1893; a federal decree of 21 February 1893 granted it the status of a &quot;free faculty&quot;, which equated it to official federal institutions. Three students completed the course as early as 1893: Antônio Gomes de Lima, Augusto Cesar Pedreira, and Rodolfo Jacob. Pena would later also be responsible for moving the faculty to Belo Horizonte in 1898.

==== New state capital ====
As no consensus was reached regarding where the new capital of Minas Gerais would be, the question was left open in the State Constitution, which only established that the capital of Minas Gerais should be moved to another location, without specifying where that would be. It was then agreed that the Minas Gerais Congress would decide the issue and, at the end of 1891, it indicated Barbacena, Belo Horizonte, Paraúna, Várzea do Marçal, and Juiz de Fora as possible locations. A law was also approved determining the formation of a tasked with presenting its opinion on the suggested locations. The committee&#x27;s members were appointed by Afonso Pena in December 1892 and its leadership fell to .

The Technical Committee&#x27;s opinion was delivered in July 1893 and the issue was once again the subject of intense debate in the state congress. Politicians from different parts of Minas Gerais demanded the capital be moved to their respective regions, but in the end the Technical Committee pointed to Belo Horizonte and Várzea do Marçal as the best places. Afonso Pena preferred Belo Horizonte, but the Congressional Committee tasked with analyzing the two options opined in favor of Várzea do Marçal, which was preferred by deputies from the south of the state. Belo Horizonte&#x27;s detractors claimed the place was unhealthy, with inadequate topography and little water. They also argued that it had poor soil for agriculture and pointed to the need to compensate the local landowners. Finally, the two places were debated in the plenary, with Belo Horizonte winning by just two votes, 30 against 28. Fourteen congressmen were not present at the voting.

Thus, on 13 December 1893, the state&#x27;s legislature met in Barbacena and approved the law that provided for the construction of Belo Horizonte within a maximum period of four years in what was then the old colonial village of Curral d&#x27;el Rey, replacing Ouro Preto as the state&#x27;s capital; the law had been proposed by Afonso Pena. Ouro Preto&#x27;s geographic features were considered an obstacle to the development of Minas Gerais.

==== Economic policy and immigration ====
Afonso Pena sought to improve the state&#x27;s economy by solving some of its most immediate issues; these included the loss of income in coffee exports due to the fact that, by being a landlocked state, Minas Gerais&#x27; production had to be exported through the port of Rio de Janeiro, which kept the tax revenues. To tackle this issue, Pena created a dry port in the municipality of Juiz de Fora, where most of the state&#x27;s coffee production was located, and made an agreement with president Floriano Peixoto by which each coffee-producing state would keep its production&#x27;s revenue, thus greatly reducing Minas Gerais&#x27; dependency on Rio de Janeiro.

At that time, Pena also defended the taxation of imported goods as a way to promote local production. Ever since his tenure in executive positions in the 1880s, he began to deviate towards a more protectionist stance, in contrast to his early liberal and laissez-faire ideas. In his own words, his position became that of a &quot;moderate protectionism&quot;. He also began to envision the state as a modernizing actor, with the role of promoting economic growth. He later declared that:

Pena also adopted a more proactive state action by promoting immigration to Minas Gerais, in particular , whose immigrants were perceived as skilled labors, necessary for the development of the state. This was in line with the ideas, common at the time, of social darwinisn and racial determinism. The government actions aimed at bringing entire families, in order to make their establishment permanent. During the imperial era, Pena had argued against the proposal of bringing Chinese immigrants, then called &quot;coolies&quot;, as he deemed it &quot;the introduction of another deleterious element to the many that are in our country&quot; and that it would contribute to the &quot;decay of the race&quot;. Despite his efforts, the number of people that immigrated to Minas Gerais was smaller than to other Brazilian states, which offered better payment and working conditions. Its system of indentured servitude, the local climate, and cholera epidemics made Minas Gerais less attractive for immigrants.

=== President of the Bank of the Republic (1895–1898) ===
Pena left the government of Minas Gerais on 7 September 1894, being succeeded by Bias Fortes. Upon leaving office, he was invited by president Prudente de Morais to occupy a position in the Supreme Federal Court and become Brazil&#x27;s plenipotentiary minister to Uruguay, in which he could help to pacify Rio Grande do Sul, where the civil war still raged, but he refused, arguing that he did not want to leave Minas Gerais. Pena only accepted the position of president of the Bank of the Republic, the current Bank of Brazil, which he held from 1895 to 1898; it was the main Brazilian banking institution at the time.

Pena&#x27;s appointment was due to the fact that Rodrigues Alves, then Brazil&#x27;s Minister of Finance, was his colleague from the Faculty of Law; together they worked to solve the economic crisis caused by the &quot;Encilhamento&quot; through a set of reforms that sought to contain government spending, restore the country&#x27;s credit, and revalue the currency&#x27;s exchange rate. During that time, Pena adopted an even more protectionist stance, suggesting that imported products, where there were equivalent ones produced in Brazil, be taxed, especially textiles and food, which was approved by Congress in 1896. At the head of the bank, he also accompanied and financially assisted the construction of Belo Hozironte. At the end of Prudente de Morais&#x27; government, Pena was optimistic about the improvement in the country&#x27;s financial situation and the easing of political tensions. He left the presidency of the bank on 14 November 1898.

=== Vice presidency (1903–1906) ===
Pena returned to Minas Gerais in 1899 and resumed his position as teacher and director at the Faculty of Law. That same year, he was elected the first president of the Deliberative Council of Belo Horizonte (1899–1904). In 1900, he was elected to the State Senate in order to replace for the remainder of the 3rd legislature (1899–1902) and then was reelected for the 4th legislature (1903–1906), but resigned in 1903, when he was elected vice president of Brazil on 18 February, following the death of Silviano Brandão, and taking office on 23 June. Brandão, elected vice president on 1 March 1902, died on 20 September of that year, less than two months before taking office. At the time, the vice president was also the president of the Senate. With Rodrigues Alves as president and Pena as vice president, the country&#x27;s leadership was then in the hands of two former members of the monarchy for the first time since the proclamation of the republic.

== Presidential election of 1906 ==
=== Negotiations ===
The Brazilian presidential election of 1906 was one of the least disputed at the time, but the issue of president Rodrigues Alves&#x27; succession had been the subject of intense behind-the-scenes disputes by the states. On one side, São Paulo elites intended to elect a fourth consecutive president from that state, with Rodrigues Alves choosing Bernardino de Campos as his successor. Other states&#x27; oligarchies saw this as an obstacle to their own ambitions, as it meant that São Paulo would maintain undue influence in the country. During the First Brazilian Republic, it was common for incumbent presidents to choose their successors, given that reelection was not allowed, and Alves thought that he could get the oligarchies to accept his choice through mere imposition. His decision caused discontent among the dominant oligarchies of several states, which launched their own pre-candidates, including Afonso Pena.

In a letter to Pena, in March 1905, Alves asked him to support Bernardino de Campos, so as to avoid eventual disputes that could emerge in the upcoming republican convention that would homologate Campos&#x27; candidacy. Pena responded a few weeks later, making clear his disagreement with the perpetuation of São Paulo politicians in power and with the government&#x27;s intention to control the succession process. Pena&#x27;s thinking aligned with that of Pinheiro Machado, an influential senator from Rio Grande do Sul, who also sought to influence the presidential succession. Machado supported Campos Sales, from the Republican Party of São Paulo (PRP), as a candidate for the upcoming election. Despite being from São Paulo, Sales, who was president of Brazil from 1898 to 1902, was not well received among a large part of the São Paulo elites due to the unpopularity of his presidency, thus dividing the PRP. In Bahia, José Marcelino, the state governor, launched Ruy Barbosa&#x27;s candidacy, further complicating the succession. 

The uncertainty regarding the official candidacy caused apprehension among the elites, as it was necessary to choose an official candidate before the convention. They feared that, if Rodrigues Alves succeeded in imposing his candidate, revolts and revolutions could break out, leading to the end of the young Brazilian Republic, as the republic&#x27;s turbulent early years, aggravated by an attempted coup d&#x27;état during the Vaccine Revolt in 1904, still haunted them.

In Minas Gerais, the PRM was divided with regard to Pena&#x27;s candidacy. Politicians from the Zona da Mata supported him, while those from the central region supported the official candidate. The governor of Minas Gerais, Francisco Sales, urged Pena to side with Rodrigues Alves against Pinheiro Machado, as he thought they could not defeat the president. Negotiations took a different turn, however, when Campos Sales withdrew his candidacy. With no alternative against the official candidate, and despite his lack of sympathy for a former member of the monarchy, Pinheiro Machado approached Pena, who was also supported by the army – still resentful of Rodrigues Alves for the repression during the Vaccine Revolt – and Campos Sales himself. Several other pre-candidates were considered, but Pena seemed the strongest one.

After the news that Minas Gerais would not support Bernardino de Campos&#x27; candidacy, the states of Bahia, Rio Grande do Sul, and Rio de Janeiro saw the opportunity of an alliance with Minas Gerais, which was able to emerge in the national stage now that its internal political disputes had been pacified. Thus, for the first time since the republic was proclaimed in Brazil, some of the large states managed to unite against São Paulo, forming the &quot;Bloco&quot; (Block) coalition. Led by Pinheiro Machado (Rio Grande do Sul), Nilo Peçanha (Rio de Janeiro), and Ruy Barbosa (Bahia), the coalition backed Afonso Pena and Nilo Peçanha for president and vice president, respectively. Ruy Barbosa withdrew his candidacy in order to support the alliance, and the newspaper &quot;Gazeta de Notícias&quot; declared: &quot;[i]t seems that Mr. senator Pinheiro Machado&#x27;s sword has cut, for once, the Gordian knot of the presidential election. Mr. Ruy Barbosa&#x27;s adherence to the opposition coalition, to the official candidacies, puts, at last, an end to the conjectures that the evolution of political maneuvers creates&quot;. Isolated, São Paulo chose to give veiled support to the &quot;Bloco&quot;.

=== Election and inauguration ===
The official launch of Afonso Pena&#x27;s candidacy took place on 1 September 1905 with a manifesto written by Ruy Barbosa, which was read in the Senate and widely publicized in the press. Pena presented his government program on 12 October 1905 in the Cassino Fluminense. The election, held on 1 March 1906, took place peacefully and Pena was elected with 97.9% of the votes. In absolute terms, however, he received the lowest number of votes for the presidency until then: 288,285. Pena ran as a single candidate, but electors were allowed to cast votes for anyone, even non-candidates. According to Cláudia Viscardi, once defeated, São Paulo candidates &quot;withdrew and remained in prolonged political ostracism, only interrupted after the succession of Venceslau Brás&quot;. 

Before taking office, Pena went on a three-month tour around the country, traveling over 21,000 kilometers and visiting eighteen state capitals, an unprecedented feat at the time. The departure took place on 16 May 1906 aboard the liner &quot;Maranhão&quot;, initially heading to northeastern and northern Brazil, followed by a brief stop in Rio de Janeiro, where Elihu Root, the U.S. Secretary of State, had arrived for the Third Pan-American Conference, and then heading south. In Porto Alegre, Pena was received by students under the leadership of the then young student Getúlio Vargas, who gave a speech on their behalf. From Rio Grande do Sul, Pena departed to Rio de Janeiro, where he arrived on 22 August 1906, heading to Belo Horizonte, the final destination, the next day.

Pena became the sixth president of Brazil after being inaugurated on 15 November 1906. His inauguration ceremony took place as usual: the official car, followed by a cavalry picket, with military honors at the Conde dos Arcos and Catete palaces, and the reading of the constitutional oath before the Senate&#x27;s vice president, Ruy Barbosa. A delegation of people nostalgic for the empire came from São Paulo to watch the inauguration ceremony.

== Presidency (1906–1909) ==
=== Domestic policy ===
According to Américo Lacombe, &quot;succeeding Rodrigues Alves was a terrible challenge for a statesman&quot;, as the outgoing president had had a &quot;brilliant&quot; administration, which earned him the epithet of &quot;the great president&quot;. The new president, abandoning his old liberal convictions, took an interventionist and protectionist line, determined to stimulate the economy through customs duties, immigration and development of infrastructure.

==== Cabinet and appointments ====
According to Lacombe, most of Pena&#x27;s cabinet choices resulted from his talks with the several new leaders he met while traveling the country before taking office. As a critic of traditional methods of political appointments, Pena based his ministerial nominations on more technical rather than personalistic criteria. The president handed the ministries to David Campista (Finance), (Interior and Justice), (Industry and Transport), Hermes da Fonseca (War), Alexandrino Faria de Alencar (Navy) and Rio Branco (Foreign Affairs). Apart from Rio Branco and the military ministers, the appointments were made in spite of the consolidated state oligarchies. The president also created the Ministry of Agriculture to diversify the country&#x27;s agricultural exports by dealing with sectors other than coffee, but the new ministry would only come to function in the following administration.

Pena&#x27;s appointments also included for the presidency of the Bank of Brazil, , who was married to one of Pena&#x27;s daughters, as secretary of the presidency (a position equivalent to the current Chief of Staff of the Presidency), and and as Supreme Court justices, ignoring Ruy Barbosa&#x27;s appeal for the appointment of José Joaquim da Palma, who Pena thought was involved in gambling. As mayor of the Federal District, Pena appointed general .

==== The &quot;kindergarten&quot; ====
Upon assuming government, Afonso Pena surrounded himself with a group of young politicians, including his cabinet. These politicians were young and still unknown, as the president wanted to diminish congressional influence in his government and to stabilize the country&#x27;s currency, one of his main goals. The ministerial nominations displeased state leaderships, some of whom had backed Pena&#x27;s candidacy, such as Pinheiro Machado and Ruy Barbosa, as they expected the ministerial appointments to be based on hierarchy and prestige. Pena&#x27;s intention of diminishing congressional influence led to an initially troubled period between the government and the legislature. The president supported Carlos Peixoto Filho, who was then less than 40 years old, as the president of the Chamber of Deputies. The government&#x27;s leadership in Congress also included other young politicians, such as João Luís Alves and James Darci. Together they were pejoratively nicknamed &quot;the kindergarten&quot;.

In this way, the government was supported by two opposing groups: on one side the &quot;kindergarten&quot; politicians, supported by a large part of the press, and on the other the traditional politicians of the &quot;Bloco&quot;, led by Pinheiro Machado. The latter group, which was behind Pena&#x27;s election, felt excluded from the ministerial nominations. Despite this, Pena sought to appear independent in relation to both. The newspapers of the time attributed a phrase to him: &quot;I&#x27;m the one who makes the policy&quot;. According to Cláudia Viscardi, the president &quot;would try hard to keep the two political groups under his control, in a conciliatory effort that had already become the hallmark of his personality&quot;.

==== Rondon&#x27;s expedition ====


In 1906, wanting to secure the occupation of Acre, which had been incorporated into Brazil following the Acre War, Afonso Pena ordered the expansion of telegraph lines from Mato Grosso to the Madeira River valley, and then to Acre, the Purus and Juruá rivers, and finally Manaus. Believing the solution to other economic, political, and social issues depended on the completion of the work, Pena appointed colonel Cândido Rondon as chief engineer of the Commission for the Construction of Telegraph Lines from Mato Grosso to Amazonas. Rondon, who was already famous for having extended telegraph lines to Brazil&#x27;s border with Paraguay and Bolivia, personally selected the members of the expedition, choosing from civilians, army officers, and soldiers. The expedition, known as the Rondon Commission, also had the additional goals of carrying out scientific exploration and delimiting the lands of the Casalvasco farm, which extended from the Aguapeí mountain range in Mato Grosso to Brazil&#x27;s border with Bolivia. The government also created, through Decree No. 6,406 of 8 March 1907, the Works Commission in the Territory of Acre, whose objective was to build roads and public buildings, unblock rivers, and populate the region with the creation of agricultural and professional centers.

The commission started its work in May 1907, later discovering the Juruena River, located in northern Mato Grosso, opening its way through the northeast of the state and crossing the Amazon jungle until it reached Manaus in 1910. During the journey, Rondon established friendly relations with the indigenous tribes, some of whom acted as guides for the expedition, and became close to the Nambikwara, who were known for cannibalism and resistance to contact with non-indigenous people. From Manaus, Rondon headed to Rio de Janeiro, where he arrived in February 1910—after four years in the jungle, during which time he was even reported missing—and was acclaimed by the population.

==== The Taubaté Agreement ====

In the second half of 1905, still during the government of president Rodrigues Alves, producers of Brazilian coffee, a product whose importance in Brazil&#x27;s economy had grown considerably since the mid-19th century, expected a record harvest of 16 million bags. Coupled with the global stock of coffee, which numbered about 10 million bags, and production from other countries, the total supply of the product for the period was expected to reach 30 million bags, while global demand did not exceed 16 million. The harvest estimate proved to be much lower than the actual harvest, which totaled 20 million bags in the 1906–1907 period, the largest crop ever harvested in the country at the time. As a result, international coffee prices were expected to fall considerably. The situation was made worse by the fact that Brazil&#x27;s exchange rate was at an all time high, diminishing profits in the local currency.

In this context, producers began to call for urgent government intervention: led by São Paulo, the largest coffee producing state in the country and also the most dependent on coffee revenues, the other coffee producing states, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, were called upon to discuss and sign an agreement in order to protect coffee prices. A coffee valorization proposal had already been made by , an industrialist and importer from São Paulo, in 1903, but it was refused by president Rodrigues Alves, who remained faithful to his policy of containing public spending, which had begun in 1898 during Joaquim Murtinho&#x27;s tenure in the Ministry of Finance. On 26 February 1906, the governors of the three coffee producing states met in the city of Taubaté and signed the homonymous agreement, inspired on Siciliano&#x27;s earlier proposal.

The agreement provided for a series of measures to increase the price of coffee, including the purchase of surplus production by the federal government, which would be done through the taking of a foreign loan of 15 million pounds. This large inflow of capital threatened to increase Brazil&#x27;s exchange rate and, as a result, diminish profits from the sale of coffee. For this reason, the agreement also provided for the creation of the (Conversion Bank) in order to keep the exchange rate stable. Furthermore, for the loan to be viable, the federal government would need to act as a guarantor, as the guarantees required by international lenders went beyond the individual states&#x27; budgetary resources.

The agreement was met with opposition from several sectors, including president Rodrigues Alves, who was against state intervention in the exchange rate with the creation of the &quot;Caixa de Conversão&quot; (Conversion Bank). In order to be implemented, it had to be approved by Congress. Fearing that the president would veto the agreement, the signatory states made changes to the text and sent the bill to create the &quot;Caixa de Conversão&quot; to be voted on separately.

Discussions in Congress began on 19 July 1906 and the agreement was approved with a large majority on 6 August 1906, becoming Decree No. 1,489. Contrary to his predecessor, Afonso Pena – then president-elect – was in favor of the &quot;Caixa de Conversão&quot;, as he deemed it &quot;essential to the balance of public finances&quot;. The bill for its creation was then approved in Congress on 6 December 1906 and signed by Pena, already sworn in office. The &quot;Caixa de Conversão&quot; would receive deposits of legal tender gold coins and in return issue bills of equal value to the depositors; the exchange rate would also be fixed at 15 pence to milréis. Thus, Brazil adopted a partial gold standard.

Afonso Pena conditioned the federal guarantee for the loan on meeting the demands of coffee growers from Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, who produced inferior quality coffee, and also on São Paulo&#x27;s support for David Campista as his successor for the 1910 elections. The federal guarantee would only come into effect in November 1908, after all conditions had been met, despite continuous pressure from São Paulo since 1906.
==== Brazilian National Exposition of 1908 ====

The idea of holding a National Exposition in Rio de Janeiro arose in 1905, and was accepted by the Brazilian Congress, which approved the budget for it in July 1907. The centennial of the opening of Brazilian ports to foreign trade, which took place on 28 January 1808, offered the pretext for its realization. The idea was to celebrate the country&#x27;s own trade and development and &quot;show Brazil for Brazilians themselves&quot;, through the exhibition of its agricultural, industrial, and artistic products. Promoted by the federal government, the exhibition also represented the final event in the series of urban and sanitary reforms undertaken in the city of Rio de Janeiro during the administration of mayor Pereira Passos and physician Oswaldo Cruz since 1903.

Preparations for the exposition began under the Pena administration, when Miguel Calmon, then minister of industry, transport and public works, formed a 41-member commission headed by engineer Antônio Olinto in October 1907. Together with mayor Marcelino de Sousa Aguiar, they chose Rio&#x27;s Urca neighborhood to host the event. King Carlos I of Portugal committed to attending the exhibition, but was assassinated on 1 February 1908, which did not impede the preparations, however.

Construction work lasted from January to June 1908, with the exhibition opening to the public on 11 August 1908, and remaining open until 15 November of the same year. The exposition featured pavilions and stands from Brazilian states, as well as from Portugal, the only foreign country invited, in addition to other individual buildings, such as the Industries Palace. The Liberal Arts Palace featured the work of several Brazilian artists such as Eliseu Visconti, João Batista da Costa, Rodolfo Amoedo, Belmiro de Almeida, Nicolina Vaz de Assis, and Ernesto Giradet. The exposition received more than a million visitors over its three-month duration, who came from all over the country.

==== Army and navy reforms ====

In line with his concerns about industrialization and military strengthening, Afonso Pena appointed Hermes da Fonseca as minister of war; upon taking office, Fonseca warned the president that conditions in the Brazilian Army were &quot;woeful&quot;. A congressman stated that the country&#x27;s Armed Forces were &quot;sadly unequipped to defend the nation against any enemy, even a 3rd or 4th class power&quot;. Brazil&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs stated that conditions in the Armed Forces were &quot;the most regrettable possible&quot;. Fonseca had conducted major military maneuvers in 1905 as commander of the 4th Military District, which exposed the precarious state of the troops, as they lacked basic equipment and discipline.

In order to tackle this issue, the government reorganized the army and the National Guard, and instituted compulsory military service through a draft lottery with the introduction of the Sortition Law (Law No. 1,860 of 4 November 1908). The previous law on the matter had kept forced recruitment, and proved to be insufficient. The new one, inspired by what was already practiced in the &quot;most civilized countries&quot;, created a military reserve in order to comply with the Brazilian Constitution of 1891, which stated that all men were obliged to military service. Other countries in South America had already adopted a lottery. Some sectors in society worried that the country would be militarizad and there would be a lack of manpower to work in agriculture and industry. Commenting on the matter, Pena declared:

As minister of war, Hermes da Fonseca sought to strengthen relations with Germany, whose army was considered exemplary, with the aim of implementing the German training model in Brazil. Groups of Brazilian officers were sent to internships in Germany in 1908. Fonseca himself went to Germany that same year, at the invitation of emperor Wilhelm II, to watch military maneuvers. There he hired a German Military Mission to supervise the reorganization of the Brazilian Army, though it ended up not materializing. However, Fonseca&#x27;s visit to Germany did bear fruit in the arms sector, with the Krupp company becoming the main provider of artillery to Brazil.

Despite the government&#x27;s modernizing efforts, the reforms produced limited immediate results: the creation of large permanent units (the strategic brigades) and the acquisition of new equipment. Resistance within the army itself prevented the adoption of some measures, and the reforms&#x27; high costs were met with resistance from the political class. The reform of the army&#x27;s General Staff took ten years to complete. Likewise, despite being adopted in 1908, the Sortition Law&#x27;s conscription measures only came into effect in 1916. The law&#x27;s most consequential effect, however, was to change the army&#x27;s relationship with society, introducing the idea of the &quot;nation in arms&quot; and expading the army&#x27;s influence in politics.

In the navy, concrete actions aimed at modernizing the fleet began to be implemented during the previous administration, when admiral Júlio César de Noronha took over the Ministry of the Navy in 1902. According to Alessandro Candeas, Brazil had held the undisputed naval dominance in South America until the early 1890s, when a large part of its navy was destroyed during the 1893 Naval Revolt, and Argentina began to build up its fleet. The economic and political crisis of the country&#x27;s early republican years had left the navy in disrepair and the ministerial reports from 1891 to 1902 drew attention to its numerous issues and possible ways to solve them. As in the army, the official consensus was that the navy was obsolete and inferior to the navies of Argentina and Chile, which had engaged in an arms race of their own in the 1890s. 

As minister of the navy, Noronha devised a broad modernization program. Approved in December 1904, it provided for the construction of several warships, including three ironclads, six destroyers and three submarines. In addition to modernizing the fleet, the program also aimed at restoring Brazilian naval hegemony in the South Atlantic and providing the means for joint continental defense in case of an invasion by European powers or the United States. With Afonso Pena&#x27;s election in 1906, however, the program would be drastically changed, mainly due to the launch of HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and criticism of the program itself. Pena appointed Alexandrino Faria de Alencar to replace Noronha, and the program was modified in 1907, with the three projected 13,000 ton ironclads being changed to the new &quot;Dreadnought&quot; type battleships, which were significantly heavier. The new dreadnoughts were initially limited to the battleships &quot;Minas Geraes&quot; and &quot;São Paulo&quot;, ordered from British shipyards. The third battleship, &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;, far heavier and more powerful than its two predecessors, was launched in 1913, but sold to the Ottoman Empire due to financial difficulties.

==== Immigration and anarchism ====

As one of his concerns since he was president of Minas Gerais, Pena instituted a more effective immigration policy. The president opted for the creation of colonial centers for the production of wine and wheat in southern Brazil. The General Directorate of the Settlement Service and the Directorate of the Propaganda and Economic Expansion Service of Brazil Abroad were created, tasked with promoting immigration, monitoring colonization, and carrying out the country&#x27;s propaganda in Europe, thus transferring the matter of immigration back to the federal government, which had been delegated to the states since 1892. The federal government also started to subsidize travel.

During Pena&#x27;s government, the first wave of Japanese immigrants arrived in the country, on the ship &quot;Kasato Maru,&quot; with 781 immigrants disembarking at the Port of Santos in June 1908. The entry of non-European immigrants into the country was limited. However, in the case of immigrants from China and Japan, the restrictions had been relaxed in 1892. All of these federal government measures contributed to the increase in the arrival of immigrants when compared to the period in which they were the responsibility of the states. In total, Brazil received 232,545 immigrants from 1907 to 1909. The country had received almost 900,000 immigrants from 1894 to 1903. From 1904 to 1913 this number would rise to a million.

The immense mass of immigrants who arrived in the country were willing to fight for labor rights. The absorption of all these workers by Brazilian industry was slow and a considerable amount of them suffered from abandonment and poverty. On 5 January 1907 Pena signed Decree No. 1,637 that granted workers the right to create unions and cooperatives. The following year, the Brazilian Workers&#x27; Confederation was created, the first union organization on a national scale in the country. The 1908–1909 period was marked by the outbreak of several strikes across the country. No republican government in Brazil had faced problems of this severity until then.

The arrival of immigrants also generated concern among the authorities, who saw in them the &quot;peril of being spoiled by all vices&quot; or being contrary to the &quot;conservative elements of society&quot;. Migration control was the responsibility of the police, who could block the entry of criminals and beggars. Soon the police authorities began to demand measures to expel immigrants who were considered &quot;undesirable&quot;. Among them were petty criminals and propagators of anarchist ideals among urban workers. Contention between immigrant workers and employers led to the possibility of expelling foreigners being discussed in Congress in 1906, after the outbreak of strikes and the holding of the First Brazilian Workers&#x27; Congress, which proposed direct action. Thus, Decree No. 1,641 of 7 January 1907 was approved, signed by the president. It became known by the name of its proponent, the São Paulo congressman ; it allowed for the &quot;cleansing&quot; of undesirable immigrants from the country. Despite the law, the labor movement continued to promote strikes, and workers&#x27; newspapers denounced intimidation by the police.

==== Infrastructure ====
During Afonso Pena&#x27;s term Brazil experienced a surge in railway construction, with several branches being opened in the states. The Central do Brasil Railway studied its arrival at the São Francisco River, an old ambition since the Brazilian Empire, and in his message to Congress in 1909, Pena announced the completion of the Madeira-Mamoré Railway. Construction of the was finished and the connection between São Paulo and Paraná via rail allowed, for the first time, the connection of Southeastern Brazil with the South by train. Brazil&#x27;s railway network reached its peak at the time, growing from 17,340.4km in 1906 to 21,466.6km in 1910.

The Rondon Commission resulted in the construction of 25 stations and the laying of 2,268km of telegraph lines. By 1909 the country&#x27;s total telegraph network size reached 69,457km. The president also improved all the country&#x27;s ports, and continued the improvements in the port of Rio de Janeiro, started in the previous administration. Since the beginning of 1908, the company Lloyd Brasileiro had been docking its ships at the pier on an experimental basis. At the end of the year, the pier was already more than 1,900 meters long and 5 warehouses were finished. The port was officially opened on 20 July 1910.

==== Economy ====
In the economy, Brazilian exports exceeded imports by 5 million pounds in 1907, although the majority of exports continued to be primary goods, especially coffee. In 1908 the budget surplus reached 10,441:338$012 réis. The following year, revenue rose to 848:665$600 in gold and 813:210$373 in paper. The exchange rate in milréis to pence was 16 11/64 in 1906 and remained relatively stable in the following years, closing at 15 9/64 in 1909. The &quot;Caixa de Conversão&quot; achieved its goal of stabilizing the exchange rate from 1906 to 1914, when it ceased to operate, but failed to stabilize economic activity. According to a later estimate by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Brazil&#x27;s GDP grew at a yearly average of 2.6% from 1907 to 1909 in 1999 BRL values.

The great influx of foreign capital to Brazil, obtained with the export of coffee, and the measures aimed at restricting the expansion of coffee crops adopted in the Taubaté Agreement, made it possible to expand the industrial sector during the period. In an industrial census held in 1907, 3,258 companies were counted, which together employed 149,018 factory workers for a total real production of 1 trillion réis. However, 49% of the country&#x27;s industrial production was concentrated in the Federal District and São Paulo. According to Richard Graham, by 1907 Brazil was &quot;producing more than half of its needs in cottons, shoes and leather goods, hats, matches, beer, macaroni and similar products, all of which had once been entirely imported, not to mention items which had often come from abroad like bricks, earthenware, and candy&quot;.

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Border issues ====
Pena nominated the Baron of Rio Branco, Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Bismarckian&quot; minister, to the ministry of foreign affairs, an office Paranhos had occupied since 1902. One of Brazil&#x27;s main concerns during the First Republic was to solve its border issues with neighboring countries. During Pena&#x27;s government, Brazil resolved border issues with Colombia and Peru. 

With Colombia, the Vásquez Cobo–Martins treaty was signed on 24 April 1907, by which Brazil ceded navigation rights in the Amazon basin in exchange for recognition of its territorial claims in the region. The disputed region, between the Japurá and Negro rivers, was the target of jurisdictional conflicts between Brazilians and Colombians. In his report to president Pena, Rio Branco declared that the treaty represented &quot;a prudent transaction because it forever dispels old concerns about conflicts that have already occurred in the uncertain border region and where they would only increase given the development of activity and private interests that takes place there&quot;.

As for Peru, Brazil signed a treaty on , by which the borders between both countries were settled and general principles regarding commerce and navigation were defined. Peru claimed a total area of 442,000 square kilometers, including a considerable part of the Brazilian state of Amazonas and the entire territory of Acre. Since 1897 there had been in the border region, which were becoming increasingly violent and threatened relations between the two countries. The treaty was negotiated based on the uti possidetis doctrine: of the 442,000 square kilometers claimed by Peru, 403,000 were attributed to Brazil, ending the dispute between the two countries that had been going on since 1863, when the Peruvian government began to claim the territory. Border issues with Venezuela and British Guiana were also resolved.

==== The Hague Convention ====

In 1907 the Second Peace Convention was held in The Hague; its goals were to stop the arms race taking place at the time and establish peaceful ways to solve international disputes. Brazil had been invited to take part in the First Convention of 1899, but refused. In 1907 it sent a delegation led by Ruy Barbosa. With a bigger number of participating nations, the convention also included several Latin American countries, such as Argentina, Chile, and Colombia, who took part in the talks at the insistence of U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. The 1907 convention was broader in scope than the previous one, and sought to establish &quot;more jurisdicity between people-to-people relations&quot; and &quot;as far as possible, replace will with law, violence with reason, intolerance with justice&quot;, in the words of Batista Pereira, a member of the Brazilian delegation.

For Brazil, the 1907 convention marked the beginning of the country&#x27;s presence at the great international events. At the head of the Brazilian delegation, Ruy Barbosa played a promiment role by defending equality between the states and positioning himself against the use of force. Barbosa recalled how Brazil had taken part in the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims, under the Treaty of Washington of 1871, when a Brazilian envoy, Marcos Antônio de Araújo, was appointed by emperor Pedro II to be one of the arbitrators. His position became clear when discussing the creation of an Arbitration Court of Justice, during which he argued that such a court was of interest of all nations and that the nomination of its members should take place regardless of each country&#x27;s relative importance. Through Ruy Barbosa, Brazil presented its thesis of democratization of the international system and defied the exclusive role played by the world&#x27;s great powers in dealing with international affairs in the 19th century. 

In a speech in Paris on 31 October 1907, Barbosa remarked that &quot;in an assembly convened to organize peace, votes cannot be classified according to the states preparedness for war&quot;. Despite his pacifism, Barbosa believed that curbing the arms race was less achievable, due to the difficulty of creating a formula that met the many countries conflicting interests. Nevertheless, on 23 July 1907 he proposed that no power should seek to alter its territories through war unless the other party refused to submit to arbitration or violated arbitration terms. A radical position at the time, the proposal did not prosper, but it became a precedent to the modern idea of prohibition of acquiring territories by force.

Brazil&#x27;s stance at the convention was not without negative reactions both from the press and the adherents of the old hierarchical diplomatic practices. In William T. Stead&#x27;s words: &quot;[i]t was said that the Conference could never stand this Dr. Ruy Barbosa. But it soon learned to put up with him and it didn&#x27;t take long for it to find out that he was one of its most powerful members. The two great forces of the Conference were Baron Marshall, from Germany, and Dr. Ruy Barbosa, from Brazil. Baron Marshall had in his favor the entire powerful army of the German Empire, a circumstance that he never tired of boasting about. Dr. Ruy only had a distant and unknown Republic, incapable of military action and with a squadron still in the shipyards. However, at the end of the Conference, Dr. Ruy Barbosa had subjugated the most powerful of its members&quot;.

==== Possible war with Argentina ====

The fear of war between Brazil and Argentina increased during the period, encouraging militarization in both countries and reaching a peak in 1908, when the two nations hovered on the brink of war. At the time, the &quot;armed peace&quot; doctrine was common on the international scene and was also applied in Argentine–Brazilian relations. In 1902, when Rio Branco assumed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brazil&#x27;s external policy shifted to the goal of achieving hegemony in the Southern Cone. Tensions between both countries began in 1904, when the Brazilian Congress approved the naval rearmament program, which threatened Argentine naval dominance in the South Atlantic Ocean and caused distrust regarding Brazil&#x27;s perceived imperialist intentions. The situation worsened when Figueroa Alcorta became president of Argentina in 1906. Alcorta appointed Estanislao Zeballos, a long time rival of Rio Branco, as minister of foreign affairs. Convinced of Brazil&#x27;s &quot;political and military resurgence&quot;, Zeballos sought to diplomatically isolate Brazil, prevent its naval build up, and improve Argentina&#x27;s relations with Uruguay and Paraguay.

Argentine newspapers such as &quot;La Prensa&quot; attacked Brazil and defended arms acquisitions for Argentina, whose navy, once the strongest in South America, had fallen behind Brazil&#x27;s. Zeballos accused Brazil of breaking the naval balance of force between both countries and considered Brazil was &quot;excessively arming its navy&quot;. The Argentine minister led an extensive anti-Brazilian campaign in the press, which prompted some sectors in Argentina to plan his removal from office. In 1908, Ruy Barbosa warned president Afonso Pena that the Argentines could attack by surprise and, in Stanley E. Hilton words, &quot;Brazilian strategists became convinced that the country could suddenly find itself at war&quot;.

That year, Zeballos sent a secret letter to Roque Sáenz Peña, the Argentine minister plenipotentiary to Spain, in which he stated that he had written evidence signed by Rio Branco that Brazil was preparing to attack Argentina. Zeballos then detailed his plan: Argentina would demand that Brazil give it one of its dreadnoughts that were under construction. If Brazil refused, Argentina would deliver an ultimatum that would give Brazil eight days to settle the issue, after which the Argentine Navy would attack Rio de Janeiro, which the Argentine ministers claimed was a &quot;well studied and easy point, due to Brazil&#x27;s defenseless situation&quot;. The secret plan was discussed with president Alcorta and his cabinet on 10 June, and two days later Zeballos would present it to Congress with the &quot;secret documents&quot; signed by Rio Branco in order to request funds to mobilize the military. However, the plan was leaked in the Argentine press on 11 June, which alarmed public opinion, harmed Zeballos&#x27; image, and caused the plan to be aborted. Under pressure, Alcorta then asked Zeballos to resign his position as foreign minister and assume the Ministry of Justice and Public Instruction. Zeballos refused that proposal but presented his resignation on 16 June 1908.

Despite resigning, Zeballos continued to claim he had documents signed by Rio Branco in which Brazil&#x27;s aggressive intentions were evident. One of these documents was an encrypted telegram, known as Telegram No. 9, sent by Rio Branco to Domício da Gama, the Brazilian minister in Santiago, Chile. The telegram, dated 17 June 1908, was intercepted, decrypted, and its contents were distorted and published in the press by Zeballos. In the falsified version, Rio Branco instructed Domício da Gama to disseminate claims of &quot;the &#x27;imperialist&#x27; pretensions of the Argentine Republic, letting it be known in the high political circles that in its vanity it dreams of the domination of Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and also our Rio Grande&quot;. The false document was read by the new Argentine foreign minister, Victorino de la Plaza, in the Senate, which pushed Congress to approve the arms build-up and shifted public opinion against Brazil. Rio Branco promptly denied the allegations, stating that the document was &quot;absolutely false&quot; and the accusations could only be the product of &quot;some man of the most exquisite bad faith&quot;.

Zeballos then claimed, through &quot;La Prensa&quot;, that he had photographs of the documents and challenged Rio Branco &quot;to review his secret Pacific archive and read the original document that exists in it, with the following addresses: &quot;17 June 1908, at 06:57, number 9&quot;. &quot;La Prensa&quot; wrote that Rio Branco would need &quot;to prove that he had not promoted anything hostile to the Argentine Republic, in the spirit of any American chancellery&quot;. In an unexpected move, Rio Branco then published the Brazilian cipher and the original text in order to prove that the Argentine version was false and that there were no aggressive Brazilian plans against Argentina. The situation caused enormous embarrassment in Argentine political circles. Demoralized, Zeballos was removed from the chancellery. With Zeballos&#x27; fall, relations between Argentina and Brazil gradually improved, and the ABC Pact, based on Rio Branco&#x27;s &quot;cordial political intelligence&quot;, was negotiated. Rio Branco later stated: &quot;[m]ore than ever, we need to put ourselves in a state of defense against this neighbor, since crazy people like Zeballos can stir up opinion there&quot;.

=== Succession crisis ===
Due to his departure from supporting the traditional interests of the oligarchies, as they had been supported in the so-called oligarchic Old Republic, Pena faced a crisis at the time of choosing his successor. David Morethson Campista, nominated by Pena to succeed him in the presidency, was rejected by groups supporting Hermes da Fonseca (mainly by Pinheiro Machado, the most influential congressman at the time). Pena tried to nominate Campos Sales and Rodrigues Alves, but without success. In the midst of all this, the also began, launched by Ruy Barbosa.

== Death ==
Afonso Pena died in the afternoon of 14 June 1909 at the Catete Palace, from severe pneumonia, the symptoms of which had worsened the night before. A medical commission consisting of doctors A. A. Azeredo Sodré, Benjamin A. da Rocha and Miguel Couto was formed that morning. At 09:30 the commission issued its first report on the president&#x27;s health, stating that he was in serious condition. A few hours later it issued another report stating that his condition had not worsened. At 14:15, being surrounded by his family and ministers, the president collapsed; after regaining consciousness, he passed out for the last time and died. According to doctor Miguel Couto, Afonso Pena&#x27;s last words were &quot;God, fatherland, liberty and family&quot;.

Minister Augusto Tavares de Lira then sent telegrams to vice president Nilo Peçanha, calling him to assume office, and to the states&#x27; presidents, giving them the news of the president&#x27;s death, which caused commotion in Brazil and abroad. Several countries expressed their grief, including Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Chile, France, Portugal, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

According to Cláudia Viscardi, Pena&#x27;s illness had been worsened by the deaths of his son Álvaro and one of his brothers, and the succession crisis. His wake was held at the government palace and, on 16 June, his body was buried in the São João Batista Cemetery.

=== Historical reputation and image ===
According to historian José Murilo de Carvalho, Afonso Pena was seen as one of the most prominent political figures of his time. José Anchieta da Silva said of him: &quot;a monarchist, he was an exponent of the Republic, becoming an uncompromising defender of order and legality, guaranteeing the consolidation of the nascent Republic&quot;. In Afonso Arinos de Melo Franco&#x27;s view, Pena was a &quot;typical Minas Gerais liberal&quot;. Bárbara Lima remarked that Pena was the only member of emperor Pedro II&#x27;s cabinet to become president of Brazil. Favorable historiography often contrasts the &quot;social peace&quot; during the presidencies of Afonso Pena and his predecessor Rodrigues Alves with the troubled period of Floriano Peixoto. For Américo Lacombe, Pena felt that transformations in the country were inevitable and sought to get closer to the values of the new generation.

For minister Tavares de Lira, Pena was a &quot;vigilant and helpful man&quot;, remarking that the president was &quot;a true representative of the old school of Imperial statesmen&quot;. The president&#x27;s contemporaries admired the elegance and &quot;finesse&quot; of his way of doing politics. Assis Cintra described him as &quot;kind, intelligent, and admirably correct in his actions&quot;. In Lacombe&#x27;s description, Pena fit the &quot;typical Minas Gerais temperament&quot;, being &quot;parsimonious, prudent, confident and tenacious&quot;. For José Anchieta da Silva, the president was &quot;a simple man with restrained habits, [...] not inclined to ostentation&quot;. Silva also stated that &quot;Pena shared the thoughts of the French philosopher Condorcet, who believed that life at the top was nothing more than a &quot;whirlwind without pleasure, vanity without reason, and idleness without rest&quot;.

In Steven Topik&#x27;s evaluation, Pena&#x27;s government &quot;represented a fusion of the interventionist tendencies of the [Brazilian] Empire with the new realities of the Republic&quot;, also pointing out that the president was of developmentalist thought. Likewise, for Cláudia Viscardi, out of all the presidents of the First Brazilian Republic, Afonso Pena was the most committed to the country&#x27;s industrial development, while also not ignoring its predominant agricultural interests. Viscardi also remarked that David Campista&#x27;s tenure as finance minister marked a rare moment in which heterodox economic ideas were put in practice during the First Republic. 

In Gabriel Rossini&#x27;s assessment, despite having resulted in diversification of investments, the Taubaté Agreement did not solve the problem of overproduction of coffee, leading, on the contrary, to the expansion of planting, since profits remained high. Therefore, new valorization programs had to be adopted in the years that followed, culminating in the permanent defense of coffee in 1924. In turn, the &quot;Caixa de Conversão&quot; operated successfully until the beginning of the First World War, when coffee and rubber prices fell and there was a decrease in the flow of foreign capital to Brazil, reversing the favorable external scenario that allowed it to operate since 1906. As a result, there was a significant drop in money supply, with a worsening in economic activity and public finances, leading to the abandonment of the gold-standard in the country. There had been no money issued since 1898 and so the convertible bills issued by the &quot;Caixa de Conversão&quot; began to replace non-convertible ones, to the point that 40% of the circulating medium was already convertible by 1912. According to Steven Topik, &quot;Brazil would never again be able to come so close to total convertibility&quot;.

=== Homages ===
Days after Afonso Pena&#x27;s death, Ruy Barbosa stated in a speech in the Senate that &quot;[i]f public service has its martyrs, we have never witnessed the most singular example of this experience&quot;. In a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, held on 30 June 1909, the Baron of Rio Branco stated that &quot;[a]ll of Brazil, which also accompanied him in this undertaking, does him the justice of believing in the purity of his intentions, seeing in him a true statesman eager to assure us the peace that we so desperately need and that all people need&quot;. The following year, Francisco Campos, then a student at the Faculty of Law, gave a lecture next to Pena&#x27;s herm, in which he stated &quot;every institution is the elongated shadow of a man&quot;. Years later, Mário Casasanta, a teacher at the faculty, remarked that &quot;Afonso Pena created a true school, and it is no small reason for glory for this generation that it managed to preserve it, to the best of its structure, because the presence of the ideals that nourished its founder&#x27;s soul can still be felt within it&quot;.

Pena was honored by his name being given to the city of Penápolis, which emerged next to the Northwestern Brazil Railway in 1907, the city of Conselheiro Pena, which emerged next to the Vitória-Minas Railway, and the Academic Center of the Faculty of Law of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, the Afonso Pena Academic Center (CAAP – &quot;Centro Acadêmico Afonso Pena&quot;). As its founder and first director, the faculty itself is affectionately called &quot;Vetusta Casa de Afonso Pena&quot; (Old House of Afonso Pena) by its students, professors, and staff, as well as the entire academic and legal community that interacts with it.

In Belo Horizonte&#x27;s Municipal Park there is a monument to the city&#x27;s &quot;founders&quot;, which features Afonso Pena alongside Augusto de Lima, Aarão Reis, and Bias Fortes. Pena also lends his name to the most important avenue in the city. Likewise, in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, his name appears on the main avenue. He also lends his name to an important avenue in Porto Velho, Rondônia. He is also honored in São José dos Pinhais, Paraná, the city&#x27;s main airport, Afonso Pena International Airport being named for him. In Santa Bárbara, Pena&#x27;s hometown, a municipal law instituted the date of his death as &quot;Afonso Pena Day&quot;. 

=== Resting place ===

On 13 February 2009, the mausoleum and remains of Afonso Pena, his wife, and three of their children were transferred from the São João Batista Cemetery, in Rio de Janeiro, to the old colonial house where he was born, in the historic center of Santa Bárbara. Inaugurated in 1912, Pena&#x27;s mausoleum was carved in Carrara marble by Rodolfo Bernardelli, a Mexican-born Brazilian artist who established himself in the country at the end of the 19th century. Surrounded by four columns, the mausoleum depicts a woman, representing the Brazilian Republic, crying over a three-ton headstone. In its dome there is a stained glass window with the Brazilian flag. The mausoleum&#x27;s style is eclectic, mixing the neoclassical and art-nouveau styles. The house also hosts the Affonso Penna Memorial, which is open to visitors, who can see there the president&#x27;s personal objects, as well as newspapers and family portraits.

<text>Giovanni Morelli (25 February 1816  – 28 February 1891) was an Italian art critic and political figure. As an art historian, he developed the &quot;Morellian&quot; technique of scholarship, identifying the characteristic &quot;hands&quot; of painters through scrutiny of diagnostic minor details that revealed artists&#x27; scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying, for example, ears. He was born in Verona and died in Milan.

== Early life and training ==
Morelli studied medicine in Switzerland and Germany, where he taught anatomy at the University of Munich. During this time he also studied Goethe&#x27;s morphology, Lavater&#x27;s physiognomy, F. Schelling&#x27;s natural philosophy and befriended Bettina von Arnim. With his return to Italy he acted as a conduit for intellectual life of the North.

== Art historian ==

=== The Morellian method ===
The Morellian method is based on clues offered by trifling details rather than identities of composition and subject matter or other broad treatments that are more likely to be seized upon by students, copyists and imitators. Instead, as Carlo Ginzburg analysed the Morellian method, the art historian operates in the manner of a detective, &quot;each discovering, from clues unnoticed by others, the author in one case of a crime, in the other of a painting&quot;. These unconscious traces — in the shorthand for rendering the folds of an ear in secondary figures of a composition, for example — are unlikely to be imitated and, once deciphered, serve as fingerprints do at the scene of the crime. The identity of the artist is expressed most reliably in the details that are least attended to. The Morellian method has its nearest roots in Morelli&#x27;s own discipline of medicine, with its identification of disease through numerous symptoms, each of which may be apparently trivial in itself. Morelli developed his method studying the works of Botticelli, and then applied it to attribute works to Botticelli&#x27;s pupil, Filippino Lippi. His fully developed technique was published as &quot;Die Werke Italienischer Meister&quot;, (&quot;The work of the Italian masters&quot;) in 1880; it appeared under the anagrammatic pseudonym &quot;Ivan Lermolieff&quot;. Morelli&#x27;s &quot;great antagonist, the art historian Wilhelm von Bode, even spoke of the spread of an epidemic of “Lermolieffmania”, after the mysterious Russian scholar “Ivan Lermolieff”, the pseudonym under which Morelli published his writings, in the German translation by an equally non-existent Johannes Schwarze, a resident of the imaginary Gorlaw, which is to say Gorle, near Bergamo.&quot;

Morelli&#x27;s connoisseurship was developed to a high degree by Bernard Berenson, who met Morelli in 1890. The first generation of Morellian scholars also included Gustavo Frizzoni, Jean Paul Richter, Adolfo Venturi and Constance Jocelyn Ffoulkes.

=== Legacy as art historian ===
Morellian scholarship penetrated the English field from 1893, with the translation of his master work. The Morellian technique of connoisseurship was extended to the study of Attic vase-painters by J. D. Beazley and by Michael Roaf to the study of the Persepolis reliefs, with results that further confirmed its validity. Morellian recognition of &quot;handling&quot; in undocumented fifteenth and sixteenth-century sculpture, in the hands of scholars like John Pope-Hennessy, have resulted in a broad corpus of securely attributed work. At the same time, modern examination of Classical Greek sculpture, in the wake of pioneering reassessments by Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, has also turned away from attributions based on broad aspects of subject and style that are reflected in copies and later Roman classicising pastiche.

The complementary field of document-supported art history traces its origins to the somewhat earlier work of Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle.

The Morellian method of finding essence and hidden meaning in details had also a much wider cultural influence. There are references to his work in the works of Sigmund Freud. Like Morelli, Freud had a medical background.

The Morellian method was re-examined by R. Wollheim, &quot;Giovanni Morelli and the origins of scientific connoisseurship&quot;, &quot;On Art and the Mind: Essays and Lectures&quot;, 1973.

== Collector and donor ==
Morelli began collecting art in the mid-1850s, &quot;follow[ing] his own tastes and scholarly interests, but without a particular plan&quot; - his earliest acquisitions were the &quot;Portrait of a Young Man&quot; by Ambrogio de Predis and the &quot;Saint John the Evangelist&quot; and &quot;Saint Martha&quot; by Bergognone. Morelli&#x27;s collection expanded &quot;mainly in the 1860s and early ’70s [...] partly thanks to the help of his cousin Giovanni Melli, who purchased several paintings for Morelli, which then came back to him by inheritance.&quot; Morelli acquired works &quot;from Florence, Siena, and Umbria [...] from ancient Tuscan families, and paintings from Emilia and Ferrara came from the sale of the prestigious Costabili Collection&quot; - including &quot;real gems&quot; such as &quot;&quot;The Young Smoker&quot; by Molenaer, Botticelli’s &quot;The Stories of Virginia&quot;, both of which were purchased at the Monte di Pietà auction in Rome, and Pisanello’s &quot;Portrait of Leonello d’Este&quot;, bought in London.&quot;

Morelli&#x27;s collection was completed in about 1874. It decorated the rooms of his residence in Via Pontaccio 14 in Milan, until Morelli’s death in 1891. Morelli bequeathed his collection to the Accademia Carrara at Bergamo (where it arrived in 1892), &quot;which thus acquired the collection of one of the greatest art historians of the nineteenth century. In 1892, Gustavo Frizzoni, a friend and faithful follower of Morelli and his method, arranged the 117 paintings and 3 sculptures in two galleries of the museum named after the senator, which later appeared in a printed catalogue.&quot;

== Political career ==
Morelli was a &quot;firm believer in the Unification of Italy [...] [taking] part in the insurrectionary uprisings in Milan in 1848, and in 1860 he was appointed senator for his patriotic merits.&quot;

<text>In probability theory and related fields, Malliavin calculus is a set of mathematical techniques and ideas that extend the mathematical field of calculus of variations from deterministic functions to stochastic processes. In particular, it allows the computation of derivatives of random variables. Malliavin calculus is also called the [[stochastic calculus]] of variations. P. Malliavin first initiated the calculus on infinite dimensional space. Then, the significant contributors such as S. Kusuoka, D. Stroock, J-M. Bismut, Shinzo Watanabe, I. Shigekawa, and so on finally completed the foundations.

Malliavin calculus is named after Paul Malliavin whose ideas led to a proof that Hörmander&#x27;s condition implies the existence and smoothness of a density for the solution of a stochastic differential equation; Hörmander&#x27;s original proof was based on the theory of partial differential equations. The calculus has been applied to stochastic partial differential equations as well.

The calculus allows integration by parts with random variables; this operation is used in mathematical finance to compute the sensitivities of financial derivatives. The calculus has applications in, for example, stochastic filtering.

==Overview and history==
Malliavin introduced Malliavin calculus to provide a stochastic proof that Hörmander&#x27;s condition implies the existence of a density for the solution of a stochastic differential equation; Hörmander&#x27;s original proof was based on the theory of partial differential equations. His calculus enabled Malliavin to prove regularity bounds for the solution&#x27;s density. The calculus has been applied to stochastic partial differential equations.

== Gaussian probability space ==

Consider a &quot;Wiener functional&quot; formula_1 (a functional from the classical Wiener space) and consider the task of finding a derivative for it. The natural idea would be to use the Gateaux derivative
:formula_2
however this does not always exist. Therefore it does make sense to find a new differential calculus for such spaces by limiting the directions.

The toy model of Malliavin calculus is an irreducible Gaussian probability space formula_3. This is a (complete) probability space formula_4 together with a closed subspace formula_5 such that all formula_6 are mean zero Gaussian variables and formula_7. If one chooses a basis for formula_8 then one calls formula_9 a &quot;numerical model&quot;. On the other hand, for any separable Hilbert space formula_10 exists a canonical irreducible Gaussian probability space formula_11 named the &quot;Segal model&quot; (named after Irving Segal) having formula_10 as its Gaussian subspace. In this case for a formula_13 one notates the associated random variable in formula_11 as formula_15.

Properties of a Gaussian probability space that do not depend on the particular choice of basis are called &quot;intrinsic&quot; and such that do depend on the choice &quot;extrensic&quot;. We denote the countably infinite product of real spaces as formula_16.

Recall the modern version of the Cameron-Martin theorem
: &quot;Consider a locally convex vector space formula_17 with a cylindrical Gaussian measure formula_18 on it. For an element in the topological dual formula_19 define the distance to the mean&quot;
::formula_20
: &quot;which is a map formula_21, and denote the closure in formula_22 as&quot;
::formula_23
: &quot;Let formula_24 denote the translation by formula_25. Then formula_26 respectively the covariance operator formula_27 on it induces a reproducing kernel Hilbert space formula_28 called the Cameron-Martin space such that for any formula_29 there is equivalence formula_30.&quot;
In fact one can use here the Feldman–Hájek theorem to find that for any other formula_31 such measure would be singular.

Let formula_18 be the canonical Gaussian measure, by transferring the Cameron-Martin theorem from formula_33 into a numerical model formula_9, the additive group of formula_8 will define a quasi-automorphism group on formula_36. A construction can be done as follows: choose an orthonormal basis in formula_8, let formula_38 denote the translation on formula_39 by formula_40, denote the map into the Cameron-Martin space by formula_41, denote
:formula_42 and formula_43
we get a canonical representation of the additive group formula_44 acting on the endomorphisms by defining
:formula_45

One can show that the action of formula_46 is extrinsic meaning it does not depend on the choice of basis for formula_8, further formula_48
for formula_49 and for the infinitesimal generator of formula_50 that
:formula_51
where formula_52 is the identity operator and formula_53 denotes the multiplication operator by the random variable formula_54 (acting on the endomorphisms). In the case of an arbitrary Hilbert space formula_10 and the Segal model formula_11 one has formula_57 (and thus formula_58. Then the limit above becomes the multiplication operator by the random variable formula_15 associated to formula_13.

For formula_61 and formula_62 one now defines the directional derivative
:formula_63

Given a Hilbert space formula_64 and a Segal model formula_65 with its Gaussian space formula_66. One can now deduce for formula_61 the integration by parts formula
:formula_68.

== Invariance principle ==
The usual invariance principle for Lebesgue integration over the whole real line is that, for any real number ε and integrable function &quot;f&quot;, the
following holds

:formula_69 and hence formula_70

This can be used to derive the integration by parts formula since, setting &quot;f&quot; = &quot;gh&quot;, it implies

:formula_71

A similar idea can be applied in stochastic analysis for the differentiation along a Cameron-Martin-Girsanov direction. Indeed, let formula_72 be a square-integrable predictable process and set

:formula_73

If formula_9 is a Wiener process, the Girsanov theorem then yields the following analogue of the invariance principle:

:formula_75

Differentiating with respect to ε on both sides and evaluating at ε=0, one obtains the following integration by parts formula:

:formula_76

Here, the left-hand side is the Malliavin derivative of the random variable formula_1 in the direction formula_78 and the integral appearing on the right hand side should be interpreted as an Itô integral.

== Clark–Ocone formula ==
One of the most useful results from Malliavin calculus is the Clark–Ocone theorem, which allows the process in the martingale representation theorem to be identified explicitly. A simplified version of this theorem is as follows:

Consider the standard Wiener measure on the canonical space formula_79, equipped with its canonical filtration. For formula_80 satisfying formula_81 which is Lipschitz and such that &quot;F&quot; has a strong derivative kernel, in the sense that
for formula_78 in &quot;C&quot;[0,1]

:formula_83

then

:formula_84

where &quot;H&quot; is the previsible projection of &quot;F&quot;&#x27;(&quot;x&quot;, (&quot;t&quot;,1]) which may be viewed as the derivative of the function &quot;F&quot; with respect to a suitable parallel shift of the process &quot;X&quot; over the portion (&quot;t&quot;,1] of its domain.

This may be more concisely expressed by

:formula_85

Much of the work in the formal development of the Malliavin calculus involves extending this result to the largest possible class of functionals &quot;F&quot; by replacing the derivative kernel used above by the &quot;Malliavin derivative&quot; denoted formula_86 in the above statement of the result. 

== Skorokhod integral ==

The Skorokhod integral operator which is conventionally denoted δ is defined as the adjoint of the Malliavin derivative in the white noise case when the Hilbert space is an formula_87 space, thus for u in the domain of the operator which is a subset of formula_88,
for F in the domain of the Malliavin derivative, we require

: formula_89

where the inner product is that on formula_90 viz

: formula_91

The existence of this adjoint follows from the Riesz representation theorem for linear operators on Hilbert spaces.

It can be shown that if &quot;u&quot; is adapted then

: formula_92

where the integral is to be understood in the Itô sense. Thus this provides a method of extending the Itô integral to non adapted integrands.

==Applications==
The calculus allows integration by parts with random variables; this operation is used in mathematical finance to compute the sensitivities of financial derivatives. The calculus has applications for example in stochastic filtering.

<text>Þórsdrápa (also Thorsdrapa; Old Norse: &#x27;The Lay of Thor&#x27;) is a skaldic poem by Eilífr Goðrúnarson, a poet in the service of Jarl Hákon Sigurðarson. The poem is noted for its creative use of kennings and other metaphorical devices, as well as its labyrinthine complexity.

==Narrative synopsis==
The principal subject of the poem is a narrative relating as to how Thor came by his hammer, Mjolnir (&quot;Mjǫlnir&quot;), and, as is usually the case in stories with Thor, how the giants came off worse. Behind it all, of course, is Loki, who gulls Thor into a confrontation with the giant Geirrod (&quot;Geirrǫðr&quot;). With the aid of some magical gifts from the giantess Grid (&quot;Gríðr&quot;), Thor, accompanied by Þjálfi, defeats Geirrod and kills a number of other giants.

The narrative begins with an account of the trickery of Loki in inciting Thor to make war again against the giants; Þjálfi joins up with Thor but Loki is altogether more reluctant to the point of not going. The narrative then details Thor&#x27;s (highly metaphorical) crossing of the oceans to Jötunheimr, with Þjálfi hanging onto his waist band. Being a drapa (&quot;drápa&quot;) the poem is rich in praise of Thor and Þjálfi&#x27;s valour in making the difficult crossing.

They are immediately set upon by a gang of giants from the cave of Geirrod, but Thor and Thjalfi (Þjálfi) quickly put them to flight (although in Snorri&#x27;s version of the tale Þjálfi is replaced with Loki). Thor is then brought into Geirrod&#x27;s house whereupon the seat he is sitting in is raised to the ceiling crushing him, however he strikes the ceiling with the stick given to him by Grid and he descends crushing two giantesses, daughters of Geirrod, beneath him.

Geirrod then invites Thor to play a game, and throws a lump of molten iron at him which he (Thor) catches in his iron gloves. Geirrod hides behind a pillar and then Thor throws the iron through the pillar and giant.

==Analogues==
The myth related in the poem is also preserved in prose form by Snorri Sturluson in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; and a looser analogue is found in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. There are a number of discrepancies between Snorri&#x27;s and Eilífr&#x27;s versions of the myth; for example Þjálfi is not present in the story in Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Edda&quot; while he has a prominent role in &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot;.

==Other &quot;Þórsdrápur&quot;==

Two (fragments of) poems are sometimes referred to as &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot;:

* three half-stanzas written by Eysteinn Valdason in the 10th century relating Thor&#x27;s fishing expedition to kill Jörmungandr;
* one stanza and two verses composed by Þorbjörn dísarskáld in the 10th or 11th century, the stanza consisting of a list of giants and giantesses killed by Thor.

Both were preserved only in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; .

<text>Anthonis Mor, also known as Anthonis Mor van Dashorst and Antonio Moro (c. 1517 – 1577), was a Netherlandish portrait painter, much in demand by the courts of Europe. He has also been referred to as Antoon, Anthonius, Anthonis or Mor van Dashorst, and as Antonio Moro, António Mouro, Anthony More, etc., but signed most of his portraits as Anthonis Mor.

Mor developed a formal style for court portraits, largely based on Titian, that was extremely influential on court painters across Europe, especially in the Iberian Peninsula, where it created a tradition that led to Diego Velázquez. It can include considerable psychological penetration, especially in portraits of men, but always gives the subject a grand and self-possessed air.

==Early life and education==
Mor was born in Utrecht, Netherlands, by some estimation between 1516 and 1520. Little is known about his early life, except that his artistic education commenced under Jan van Scorel. His earliest known work is a portrait which is now in a collection in Stockholm, dated 1538.

== Painting career ==

A group of Knights of St. John at Utrecht, supposed to have been painted about 1541; and a picture of two pilgrims at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, dated 1544; and the portrait of an unknown woman, in the Lille gallery, were probably among his earliest works. Their authenticity has not been established.

==Antwerp==

In 1547 Mor was received as a member of the Venerable Guild of St. Luke at Antwerp, and shortly afterwards (about 1548) he attracted the attention of Cardinal Granvelle, Bishop of Arras, who became his steady patron. Of the portraits executed during the early period of his career as Granvelle&#x27;s protege, two are especially notable: one of the bishop himself (in the imperial gallery in Vienna), and one of the Duke of Alba, which now belongs to the Hispanic Society of New York. Between 1549 and 1550 Prince Philip II of Spain (1527–1598) traveled around the Netherlands to present himself as the future ruler. Mor painted his portrait in Brussels in 1549. He probably visited Italy (when exactly is not known), where he copied some works by Titian, notably the &quot;Danaë&quot;.

==Portugal==
In the middle of 1550 Mor left for Lisbon with a commission from Mary of Hungary to portray the Portuguese branch of the family. Mor probably traveled via Valladolid, where he painted the portraits of Maximilian II and his wife Maria of Austria, their daughter Anna and the son of Philip II of Spain, Don Carlos. In Lisbon, Mor portrayed King John III, Queen Catharine, Prince João Manuel and Philip II&#x27;s future wife, Princess Maria of Portugal. Little more is known about Mor&#x27;s stay in Portugal, but he was definitely back in Brussels by November 1553.

==England==
After the sudden death of the king of England, Edward VI, in July 1553, the Spanish king Charles V now saw the possibility of an alliance between Spain and England. The engagement between Philip and his Portuguese princess was broken and negotiations started for a marriage with the successor to the English throne, Mary Tudor. During these negotiations, Mor was sent to England to paint a portrait of Mary, but the exact date of the painting is unknown. This portrait was much appreciated in England and Mor made at least three versions, which became much the best-known likeness of the queen (Prado, Marquess of Northampton). On 20 December 1553, Philip officially appointed Mor as painter in his service.

==Brussels / Utrecht==
In October 1555, Charles V abdicated from the throne. During the ceremonies and festivities surrounding the coronation of his son Philip as king of Spain, Mor would have received many commissions for paintings. Unfortunately, many of these paintings are lost or only known through copies.

Mor was very productive after Philip&#x27;s ascension to the throne, and produced some of his most important portraits in this period, such as the portrait of Prince William I van Oranje-Nassau (William the Silent) (1555), the portrait of Alessandro Farnese (1557) and a new portrait of Philip II. Other important works from this period include the portrait of Jane Dormer (1558), the portraits of Jean Lecocq and his wife (1559), and the portrait of Jan van Scorel (1559), which was at a later time to be hung at his tomb and now belongs to the Society of Antiquaries (London). Following the death of Mary Tudor in 1558, King Philip was remarried in June 1559 to Isabella de Valois, whom Mor portrayed ca. 1561. This portrait appears to have been lost. Also from this period dates the only known self-portrait of Mor, now in the Uffizi Gallery, and one of his (presumed) wife, now in the Prado (see image gallery below).

==The Spanish Court==
It seems likely that Mor accompanied King Philip on his return to Spain in 1559. That Mor stayed at the Spanish court is confirmed by the letters which Philip regularly sent to Mor after he had left again in 1561. In his letters, Philip requested Mor&#x27;s return to court several times, but the painter never complied with his repeated requests. Among the works which Mor supposedly painted in Spain are the Portrait of Juana of Austria and the Portrait of Don Carlos. A much-praised work from this period is the Portrait of Pejerón, the fool of the Earl of Benavente and the Duke of Alba. There has been extensive speculation about the reason for Mor&#x27;s departure from the Spanish court. According to Carel van Mander, Mor became too confidential with the king and this aroused the suspicion of the Inquisition. He may also have been alarmed by the increasingly repressive Counter-Reformation tenor of the Spanish court. Mor&#x27;s pupil Alonso Sánchez Coello continued to work in his master&#x27;s style, and replaced him as the Spanish court painter.

==Return to the Netherlands==
On his return to the Netherlands, Mor probably traveled back and forth between Utrecht, Antwerp and Brussels. In this period he was in regular contact with Granvelle and also worked at the Dutch court, where he portrayed Margaretha of Parma. After his return, Mor focused on the portrayal of citizens, especially of merchants and their wives in Antwerp. In addition to portraits like these (which included the Portrait of Thomas Gresham), he also painted artisans, such as the goldsmith Steven van Herwijck (1564). These works are markedly different from the paintings Mor produced for the court, showing off another side of his talent. When Granvelle returned to France and the Netherlands showed increasing social and political unrest, Mor experienced some financial hardship. His financial problems were partially solved when the Duke of Alba granted him commissions and favors. He is not known to have been in Utrecht after 24 July 1567 and from 1568 onwards Mor lived in Antwerp where, in 1572, he registered as a master with the Antwerp guild. At Antwerp he painted a &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; for the new Stadhuis. It is possible that he visited England once again in 1568, judging from the Portrait of a &quot;Nobleman with Dog&quot; and of the Portrait of Sir Henry Lee, which have been attributed to him. In 1559 and 1562 Mor painted two portraits of Margareta of Parma. On her way to Spain, Anne of Austria spent some time in Antwerp, where she was painted by Mor in 1570. Mor&#x27;s portrait of Anna is his last-known court painting, although he was still being referred to as Philip II&#x27;s court painter in 1573.

Little is known about Mor&#x27;s life and career after 1570. It seems likely that he lost custom, maybe as result of competition by painters such as Adriaen Thomasz. Key, Frans Pourbus the Elder (1545–1581) and Frans Floris (1519/20-1570). The last portrait attributed to Mor is the Portrait of Hubertus Goltzius, dated 1576. Toward the end of his life, Mor focused on history paintings of religious and mythological subjects, but in this field of work he would never equal his earlier success as a portrait painter. He is believed to have been working on a &quot;Circumcision&quot; for the Cathedral of Antwerp when he died in 1576.
==Main works==


Many of Mor&#x27;s portraits were copied by others. Among those whose works have been confused with Mor&#x27;s are Alonso Sánchez Coello, Francisco de Holanda, and Cristóvão de Morais Lopes. A large number of engravings based on his work also circulated.

<text>Fire clay is a range of refractory clays used in the manufacture of ceramics, especially fire brick. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines fire clay very generally as a &quot;mineral aggregate composed of hydrous silicates of aluminium (Al2O3·2SiO2·2H2O) with or without free silica.&quot;

==Properties==
High-grade fire clays can withstand temperatures of 1,775 °C (3,227 °F), but to be referred to as a &quot;fire clay&quot; the material must withstand a minimum temperature of . Fire clays range from &quot;flint clays&quot; to &quot;plastic fire clays&quot;, but there are &quot;semi-flint&quot; and &quot;semi-plastic&quot; fire clays as well. Fire clays consist of natural argillaceous materials, mostly kaolinite group clays, along with fine-grained micas and quartz, and may also contain organic matter and sulphur compounds.

Fire clay is resistant to high temperatures, having fusion points higher than ; therefore it is suitable for lining furnaces, as fire brick, and for manufacture of utensils used in the metalworking industries, such as crucibles, saggars, retorts and glassware. Its stability during firing in the kiln means that it can be used to make complex items of pottery such as pipes and sanitary ware.

==Chemical composition==
The chemical composition typical for fire clays are 23-34% Al2O3, 50-60% SiO2 and 6-27% loss on ignition together with various amounts of Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, K2O, Na2O and TiO2. Chemical analyses from two 19th-century sources, shown in table below, are somewhat lower in alumina although a more contemporary source quotes analyses that are closer.

==Extraction==
Unlike conventional brick-making clay, some fire clays (especially flint clays) are mined at depth, found as a seatearth, the underclay associated with coal measures.

<text>The Alfa Romeo 156 (Type 932) is a compact executive car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Alfa Romeo. It was introduced at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show as the replacement for the Alfa Romeo 155. The 156 received a positive reception and in the following year went on to win the 1998 European Car of the Year award. The 156 saloon was discontinued in Europe late in 2005, while the Q4 Crosswagon continued in production until the end of 2007.

Cars were assembled at the Fiat Group factory in Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco, Italy and at a General Motors facility in Rayong, Thailand. Production in Thailand began in March 2002 and ran for only a couple of years. The cars produced there were targeted for the Asia-Pacific markets. Between 1996 and 2007, 673,435 units of the 156 were produced.

The 156 was available in saloon, &quot;Sportwagon&quot; (estate) and &quot;Crosswagon&quot; (crossover) bodystyles with seven engine configurations; it went through two facelifts, first in 2002 and then in 2003. The Sportwagon advertising campaign was made featuring actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.

In 2005, the 159 became the replacement for the 156.

== Overview ==

Since the 156&#x27;s introduction, various four cylinder engine configurations were available and included the &quot;Alfa Romeo Twin Spark engine&quot; (1.6 L - , 1.8 L - and 2.0 L - ) 16 valve models with variable valve timing, along with the straight-4 1.9-litre 8-valve . The range also included a straight-5 2.4-litre 10-valve &quot;JTD&quot; common rail turbodiesel engine. Until January 2002, the range-topping engine was the venerable 2.5-litre 24-valve &quot;Busso&quot; V6 - now with double overhead camshafts and four-valve heads - rated at .

Initially the 156 range was available with different options (packs) like a sport pack that included Blitz clothing, Momo leather interior and Recaro seats, it also included wheels, lowered suspension and leather-trimmed steering wheel and gear knob. The Lusso pack added with Momo&#x27;s mahogany steering wheel and gear knob and for Nordic countries, a special winter pack consisting of fog lights, headlight washers, and heated seats was available.

Starting from 1999 a five-speed &quot;Selespeed&quot; automated manual transmission was available as an option on the 2.0-litre Twin Spark version and a four-speed automatic &quot;Q-System&quot; on the 2.5-litre V6 version, the Q-system provided the option of using the car as a normal automatic or being able to shift manually with H-pattern, it has three automatic modes: city, sport and ice.

A significant addition to the 156 range came in 2000 with the introduction of the Sportwagon station wagon or estate bodystyle, debuting at the Geneva Motor Show. The new bodystyle was in development from 1998 by Stola under the project code &#x27;932 AF&#x27;. According to Stola&#x27;s records the initial considered name was &quot;Powerwagon&quot;. While not a core part of the company&#x27;s range, estate versions of the Alfasud and 33 - the first to carry the name Sportwagon - were produced and a 75 Sportwagon was shown at Geneva, but became an early victim of the Fiat takeover. The Sportwagon was also available with Boge-Nivomat self-levelling hydropneumatic rear suspension. The Sportwagon was marketed as a lifestyle estate without large carrying capacity. The Sportwagon bodystyle filled a gap in the market that Alfa Romeo had distanced themselves from since the 33 SportWagon of the 1980s.

In 2001 engines were upgraded to comply with the Euro III standards and were rated at (1.6 L), (1.8 L), (2.0 L) and (2.5 L).

==Design==
Designed by Alfa Centro Stile under the guidance of head designer Walter de&#x27;Silva the 156s shape was intended to be distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its styling included high, curved flanks, retro styled front door handles, recessed rear door handles, and a deep grille requiring an off-centre licence plate holder. The design featured visually deemphasized rear door handles and accentuated front handles, giving the illusion of a coupé profile. The design was influenced by the Alfa Romeo 1900, Giulietta and Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (&quot;C&quot;d) of 0.31.

===Interior===
The original interior uses a scalloped upper dashboard and a simple centre console. The main controls and displays are angled to the driver. The interior design lacks cup holders.

The 156 Sportwagon features fold-down rear seats to increase the luggage area normally covered by a privacy screen.

2002 saw an update to both the interior and exterior of the 156.

==Facelifts==

===2002 facelift (first series)===

2002 also saw the arrival of a facelifted interior with different matte-finish surfacing and chrome highlights.
This new version featured the 147&#x27;s dual-zone digital climate controller while the interior climate could also be controlled via an air quality sensor. A different choice of colours were available for the interior, with the option of a two-tone interior very much like that on offer from its European rivals. A wider range of options including xenon lighting, tele-informatics (CONNECT and CONNECT NAV) and a Bose stereo system were available, the stereo system could now also be operated via buttons on the steering wheel. Also, the &quot;Selespeed&quot; gearbox control system was updated, buttons on the steering wheel were replaced by paddle shifters, as seen on the earlier Alfa Romeo 147. In the center console, the designers added a multifunctional display with trip computer, fault, and service monitor.

The upgrade also included electronic stability control VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) with an emergency brake assist device and slip control ASR (Anti Slip Regulation) came as standard. Additionally, an MSR (Motor Schleppmoment Regelung) was added to the car, this device prevents wheel skidding by restoring torque to the engine for example when the gear is shifted down abruptly under conditions of low grip. Passive safety was also made better, all versions got window airbags as standard. The 2.0 L &quot;JTS&quot; engine with gasoline direct injection replaced the 2.0-litre Twin Spark engine, offering more low end torque and more power than the Twin Spark. The diesel engines were also uprated. The only notable difference exterior-wise was body-coloured mirrors and bumper strips which were earlier black.

===2003 facelift (second series)===
Late 2003 saw the launch of a facelifted 156, with new front and rear fascias designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.alfaromeopress.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A new top-of-the-line model was added to the line up called TI (Turismo Internazionale) designating a sporty kit, this version was equipped with modified suspension, bigger wheels (215/45 17&quot;) and leather-trimmed interior. The GTA models never received the exterior update. Diesel engines underwent a major overhaul which included a new four-valve per cylinder heads and a second stage common rail injection with 1400 bar maximum injection pressure with up to five injections per cycle for lower noise, consumption, and higher performance. They were rated at 140/150 PS (103/110 kW) for straight-4 1.9-litre 16-valve and for straight-5 2.4-litre 20-valve.


==Variants==
===156 GTA===

The 156 GTA and 156 Sportwagon GTA were launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2001. The GTA was named after the Alfa Romeo GTA from the 1960s, the letters GTA meaning Gran Turismo Alleggerita (). Developed alongside the 147 GTA, it was an exclusive high-performance model hand assembled on a dedicated production line separate to the standard 156 models.

Development of the GTA styling models and engineering design was entrusted in early 2000 to Stola with styling data provided by Centro Stile. Stola completed six prototypes that were further mechanically assembled by Alfa Romeo. Two of those protypes were presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

1,973 berlinas and 1,678 Sportwagons were built until the GTA production stopped in October 2005, as the V6 engine as unable to meet emissions regulations and due to the 156 being replaced by the 159. The GTA was sold in limited numbers, with right-hand drive vehicles holding a premium over left-hand drive vehicles due to their rarity.

The very first GTA was sold via online auction, from 13 to 23 September, the duration of the Frankfurt Motor Show. Winning bid was €48,691.26, which was donated to &quot;Telethon&quot; charity fund.

The 3.2-litre &quot;Bussone&quot; V6 engine (The big Busso, so-called after legendary Alfa Romeo engineer Giuseppe Busso). This engine is praised universally for its sound and revving capabilities.
This was the largest iteration of the engine built by Alfa Romeo. The engine has a bore and a stroke, displacing at . It was rated at and of torque. Overall, the car weighed more than the standard V6 156.

The GTA variants shared a common interior with post-facelift 156 variants. The doors, boot lid and bonnet were also shared. All else was unique to the GTA, with the engine specifically made by Fiat and Maserati Research Centres.

The GTA did not receive the Giugiaro designed facelift introduced on the 156 in 2003, but continued with the acclaimed Walter de Silva design to the very end of production.

The steering was also made faster, only 1.7 turns from lock to lock compared to 2.1 in normal models. The GTA had also larger brakes (Brembo), at front discs and rear . The front discs were later upgraded to to cope with the performance potential.

===156 Sportwagon Q4===
In 2004 Sportwagon Q4, an all-wheel drive version of the Sportwagon was launched in some markets. The Q4 (short for Quadrifoglio 4) system used three differentials, the central one being of the Torsen C limited slip type; it added about to the vehicle weight. Graziano Trasmissioni, the Turin-based transmission specialist, developed this system. A raised ride height meant the Sportwagon Q4&#x27;s was tall. Other than the ride height, special 5-spoke 17-inch wheels and a &quot;Q4&quot; badge on the tail set the Sportwagon Q4 apart from the front-wheel drive 156 versions. The Sportwagon Q4 was only available on LHD markets, with no RHD models being built or sold. The only available engine was the 1.9 M-Jet diesel with .

===156 Crosswagon Q4===
The Crosswagon Q4 was launched in 2004 with a crossover look and enhanced off-road capabilities. The Crosswagon&#x27;s ride height was raised further compared to the Sportwagon Q4, giving the car better approach and departure angles; at it was taller than a standard 156. Tall-sidewall all-season tyres on 17 inch wheels were standard. The only available engine was 1.9 M-Jet diesel rated at . The Crosswagon was made to look more like an all-terrain vehicle by unique front and rear bumpers and door sills with steel inserts. After the introduction of the 159 in 2005 the Crosswagon remained in production, and in 2007 it was the last 156 model to be discontinued.

===Special versions===
====Alfa Romeo 156 GTAm====
The Alfa Romeo 156 GTAm was shown at the Bologna Motor Show in December 2002. The car was built by Fiat Group&#x27;s partner N.Technology. The GTA engine was bored to and power was increased to . The car had widened wheel arches, 19 inch tyres and was equipped with N.Technology limited slip differential. This car never reached production phase.

====Alfa Romeo 156 Sportwagon GTA 3.5 Autodelta====
At the 2004 Geneva Motor Show Italian-based tuning firm Autodelta unveiled a 156 Sportwagon prototype equipped with a V6 engine that developed at 6,800 rpm.&lt;ref name=&quot;italiaspeed.com/2004/motor_show&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The car was fitted with Bilstein adjustable shock absorbers, Eibach springs and Brembo front brakes with a diameter of . Weight was reduced using a composite engine bonnet.

====Autodelta 156 GTA 3.7 V6====

London-based tuning firm Autodelta made two high performance versions based on the 156 GTA: in the GTA AM version, the Alfa Romeo V6 engine was bored to , making it capable of at 7,300 rpm. With this, the car could attain a top speed of and accelerate to 100 km/h in 5.2 s.

The GTA AM Super was an upgrade of the first version, now fitted with a Rotrex supercharger and rated at .

==Specifications==

===Platform and suspension===
The 156 uses a platform derived from the Alfa Romeo 155, which in turn was derived from the Fiat Group&#x27;s &quot;Tipo&quot; platform. However, it is sufficiently different from the original &quot;Tipo&quot; one to be seen as a new platform. The 156 is a highly developed front-wheel drive car; (the Cross/Sportwagon Q4 offered four-wheel drive in left-hand drive markets) with a double high wishbone front suspension and updated version of MacPherson type rear suspension, which consists of a telescopic vertical strut with coaxial spring and two transverse links of different lengths and a longitudinal strut. This structure means that the rear wheels have a tiny passive steering ability. Weight saving materials (mainly aluminium) have been used in several parts both front and rear suspension.

For the 156 GTA, weight saving materials were also used in many other parts like magnesium framed front seats and dashboard frame. The 156 GTA only shared common parts with other 156 variants with respect to the facelift interior, doors, bonnet and boot lid.

===Engines===
The 156 offered various engines and power output choices during its lifespan, four and six cylinder petrol engines and four and five cylinder
diesel engines, all produced at Pratola Serra except the V6 engines, which were produced at Alfa Romeo&#x27;s Arese plant, with the GTA engines being produced at the Maserati Research Centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;italiaspeed.com/newmodels_156gta&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2.4 JTD diesel was world&#x27;s first common rail diesel engine in a passenger car.


==Use in law enforcement==
The Alfa 156 sedan and the station wagon were widely used by the Italian and other police and other law enforcement forces. In Italy it was used by Carabinieri, Polizia di Stato, Polizia provinciale, Polizia Penitenziaria and Guardia di Finanza. Subsequently, the 156 was replaced by the more modern Alfa Romeo 159.

==Awards==

In 1998, an international jury of 56 journalists (40 of whom voted for the 156) representing 21 countries awarded the Alfa 156 the European Car of the Year award; it was described as having a &quot;very refined suspension layout so to offer an impeccable roadholding&quot;. The 2.5 V6 engine was awarded with the International Engine of the Year award in 2000. The 156 has won more than 35 awards, including:

<text>ACC Loan Management Limited, formerly ACCBank plc, was originally a commercial bank in Ireland that focused on agriculture and SME lending, and later became a company that focussed on managing the lending facilities of its existing clients. The bank had its origins in the Agricultural Credit Corporation (&quot;Corparáid an Chairde Talmhaíochta&quot;) set up in 1927 in the Irish Free State to finance agriculture; the bank was successful and led to the creation of the Industrial Credit Company, which was modelled on it and provided finance to industry. In the early 1990s, the company name was changed from &quot;Agricultural Credit Corporation plc&quot; to &quot;ACCBank plc&quot; in order to signify that the company was then targeting more than simply agricultural customers. In early 2002, the bank was sold by the Irish Government to Rabobank, it was one of the three entities of the Rabobank (Ireland).

== Company history ==

1927

The Agricultural Credit Corporation was founded in September 1927 and was one of the first creations of the Irish Free State.

1988

A new Agricultural Credit Act empowered the corporation to deploy up to 25% of its risk assets outside agriculture and the foundations of present-day ACCBank were laid.

2000

ACCBank refocused its business model on the SME and Agri sectors positioning the bank as a relationship bank in these sectors.

2002

ACCBank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Rabobank. With the backing of its parent, ACCBank embarking on ambitious plans to strengthen and grow its presence in Ireland as a leading Business and Agri-business bank.
As part of the Netherlands-based, former AAA rated, Rabobank Group, ACCBank’s range of products and services included commercial mortgages, working capital finance, asset finance and leasing and wealth management.

2014 - ACCBank Restructuring, ceases banking, debt recovery focus

ACCBank decided to restructure with a focus solely on debt recovery, and stopped delivering banking services on 30 May 2014. This meant the closure of current accounts and return of all deposits, including interest due. All Business Centres in Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Mullingar, Sligo and Waterford were closed to the public and the management of loan facilities was centralised instead of being dealt with the local business centres.

ACCBank ceased to be a bank mid-2014 returning its banking licence but continued to manage its loan portfolio. After ACCBank returned its banking licence, it was regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, but with an alternative status and not as a bank.

Commenting on the changes, country manager Kevin Knightly for parent Rabobank found losses incurred by ACC Bank Plc because of the property crisis, a position emerging of its costs exceeding income during 2014 and that position was unsustainable for its parent, requiring immediate action to stem loses. The bank had reported losses since 2007.

ACC also explored the possibility of outsourcing a portion of its loan book, in the region of 10%, excluding agricultural loans and selected Capita as the preferred service provider who have 1,000 staff in Ireland.

ACC had 5,000 deposit customers totaling €110 million. Overdrafts on current accounts amounted to almost €75m.

The parent company, Rabobank Group, had provided capital support of €1.3 billion to ACC since 2008 with over €2.1 billion of the loan book written down since 2008.

SIPTU and UNITE trade unions wanted the Government to take ACC Bank back into State ownership and were looking for a meeting with the Minister for Finance in an attempt to seek to save jobs. They referred to the inclusion of a State investment bank in the Programme for Government. There was some redeployment opportunities to Rabobank but no new business was being generated for some time with the bank&#x27;s staff focused on debt recovery. 
2018-19: Sale of loans
In December 2018, ACCLM transferred the ownership of outstanding loans to the Dutch parent company, which sold the portfolios the following year.

The remaining assets and liabilities of ACCLM, mainly consisting of dormant or unclaimed accounts, were transferred to ACC Investments Limited. ACCIL still operates from a small office in the International Financial Services Centre with a skeleton staff.

<doc id="837892" wikidata="Q544310" url="?curid=837892" title="The Fake Sound of Progress">
<text>The Fake Sound of Progress (stylized as thefakesoundofprogress) is the debut studio album by the Welsh rock band Lostprophets, originally released on 27 November 2000 through Visible Noise. The album would be released in 2001 by Columbia Records and was met with stronger sales numbers around the world. This is the only album to feature DJ Stepzak although he was only in the original version, and the first album to have Jamie Oliver although he was only in the remastered version.

The album peaked at number 186 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 120,000 copies in the United States alone, and reached high positions on charts worldwide. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja&quot; and &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;; these singles helped Lostprophets reach mainstream popularity. In 2010, the album was certified platinum by the BPI in the United Kingdom.

== Recording ==
The band began work on the album in 2000, after finding a suitable bass player. Much of the album started as quickly-recorded demos from &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress EP&quot;. The song &quot;MOAC Supreme&quot; became &quot;A Thousand Apologies&quot;, and &quot;Directions&quot; was released as the B-side for the single &quot;Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja&quot;. The album was recorded in one week for around £4000, and while originally intended as another demo, went on to be released on Visible Noise Records in late 2000. Because of the album&#x27;s shortened recording process, the band were unhappy with the end result. The title of their second studio album &quot;Start Something&quot; refers to this, as they felt it better reflected their music abilities.

When the band signed to Columbia Records in 2001, it was partly re-recorded, remixed, and re-released that same year. The changes to the music, such as merging the interludes between tracks with the ends of songs, was met with chagrin by fans of the earlier release. The title track of the album, in addition to being partially re-recorded, was also sped up significantly. The remastered version of the album was released in 2001 in the UK and US respectively, and was produced by Michael Barbiero.

== Release ==
The album didn&#x27;t initially receive much attention, but entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart following the release of the first single from the album, &quot;Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja&quot;.

== Reception ==

When released, the album was met with mixed reviews by music critics, comparing it to American bands such as Faith No More, Incubus, Korn, Linkin Park, and Limp Bizkit. Scene Point Blank wrote that on the album, the band &quot;combined the versatility of Faith No More and the radio-appeal of Incubus with the charm of their countrymen Duran Duran.&quot; Allmusic reviewer Brian O&#x27;Neil gave the album two out of five stars and said that &quot;the only redeeming quality is the great production by Michael Barbiero, that allows all instruments to be heard perfectly in all their ennui-inducing glory, proving that no matter how much you polish up a turd, it&#x27;s still a turd.&quot; O&#x27;Neil also noted similarities between vocalist Ian Watkins and Faith No More&#x27;s Mike Patton, commenting that &quot;whether it [is] sweet melodic intervention, the pseudo-rapping, or maniacal screaming, the entire Faith No More repertoire seems to be unleashed in &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;.&quot; Ben Rayner from Drowned in Sound gave the album 10 out of 10 stars and quoted &quot;in the world of Lost Prophets it&#x27;s very easy to find something different with every listen with their non-chaotic but well textured tunes.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; reviewer John Mulvey called the album &quot;weirdly impressive&quot;, while no stars were given the album got a positive review.

== Tour ==
After the release of the album, Lostprophets went on a tour in Europe and America. Before the release of &quot;Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja&quot;, the band went on a brief tour with the fellow British rock band Muse. They toured Austria and Germany together from 21–27 October 2001. The band would also tour for the NME Carling Awards Tour which featured dates in the London Astoria among others. They also took part in the successful Nu-Titans tour with Defenestration and other famous British metal bands. The band subsequently toured on the Irish leg of Ozzfest. They had also played at the Glastonbury and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. In 2002, the band headlined the Deconstruction Tour in Finsbury Park, London on 3 June; supporting acts were Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Mad Caddies among other well-known artists. In October, Lostprophets returned to the UK for a tour visiting big cities such as Glasgow, Manchester and London.

<doc id="837911" wikidata="Q57114" url="?curid=837911" title="Jens Lehmann">
<text>Jens Gerhard Lehmann (; born 10 November 1969) is a German former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He was a member of Arsenal&#x27;s &quot;Invincibles&quot;, playing every match of their unbeaten title-winning season. He holds the UEFA Champions League record for the most consecutive clean sheets, not conceding a single goal in eight consecutive full matches while he played for Arsenal. He also has the highest number of continuous minutes without conceding goals. In total, this lasted 853 minutes. He is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.

Lehmann was voted UEFA Club Goalkeeper of the Year for the 1996–97 and 2005–06 seasons, and was selected for three World Cup squads.

==Club career==
===Schalke 04===
Lehmann started his career in the 1988–89 season with Schalke 04, playing for them for nearly a decade. His first years were rocky, notably a game against Bayer Leverkusen in 1993 in which he conceded three goals and was substituted after 45 minutes, causing him to flee the stadium alone by tram rather than taking the team bus, but Lehmann gradually established himself as a strong keeper lauded for his ability to intercept crosses.

He scored his first league goal on 12 March 1995 in a 6–2 victory over 1860 Munich in the 84th minute, scoring Schalke&#x27;s sixth goal from the penalty spot. His second goal was a last-minute equaliser scored against bitter rivals, Borussia Dortmund, in the Revierderby on 19 December 1997.

Lehmann became Schalke&#x27;s team hero in their 1997 UEFA Cup Final victory over Inter Milan, after playing a strong season and saving an Iván Zamorano penalty in a penalty shootout.

===AC Milan===
Lehmann left Schalke for AC Milan in 1998, but his performances were below par. In one game Gabriel Batistuta scored a hat-trick against him, including a goal from a free kick in the box which Lehmann had conceded by handling a back pass. In another game he was substituted after giving away a penalty. After just five matches, Lehmann was dropped. Believing he wouldn&#x27;t get another chance at Milan, he left during the winter.

===Borussia Dortmund===
In early 1999, Lehmann returned to Germany to play for Borussia Dortmund replacing long-time goalkeeper Stefan Klos. Lehmann had a difficult start there after several poor performances. Rumors arose that Lehmann might leave, with supporters viewing him critically.

But the tide eventually turned and Lehmann&#x27;s form improved, becoming a reliable figure in the team. He played a significant part in the club&#x27;s return to the upper echelons of German and European football. Borussia Dortmund began the 2001–02 season strongly and eventually won the Bundesliga in 2001–02. That same year, Borussia Dortmund reached the UEFA-Cup final, though the team lost to Dutch club Feyenoord Rotterdam.

Around this time, Lehmann developed a reputation for his poor disciplinary record. In a match against SC Freiburg, Lehmann kicked opposing attacker Soumaila Coulibaly after they collided in the penalty area. Lehmann was suspended afterwards. He currently holds the record for most red cards for any Borussia Dortmund player, and the record for most red cards for a goalkeeper in the German Bundesliga.

Lehmann&#x27;s form slipped in the 2002–03 season, along with Borussia Dortmund&#x27;s. His time at Dortmund was winding down, and after the season concluded, he left Dortmund. He was replaced by Roman Weidenfeller and Guillaume Warmuz, who had just left Arsenal.

===Arsenal===
====2003–04 season====
Lehmann joined Arsenal on 25 July 2003 replacing the recently departed David Seaman. Arsenal&#x27;s 2003–04 season was historic. The Gunners finished the 2003–04 FA Premier League season unbeaten, becoming the first English club to accomplish the feat in the modern era and only the second to ever have an unbeaten season in English football&#x27;s top tier, the only other team to accomplish this feat being Preston North End in the 1888–89 season. Lehmann played every match in Arsenal&#x27;s unbeaten season, though his swashbuckling playing style did lead to occasional mistakes. For example, in the title-winning match at local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, Lehmann pushed Tottenham striker Robbie Keane as the pair waited for a Tottenham corner. He also committed an error that led to the equalising goal in Arsenal&#x27;s Champions League defeat at home to Chelsea the same season. Despite these mistakes, Lehmann&#x27;s addition to the Arsenal team had a major effect on Arsenal&#x27;s ability to finish unbeaten. And Arsenal continued unbeaten until 24 October 2004. At the end of his first season at Arsenal, he had already played 54 times earning himself a Premier League winners medal.

====2004–05 season====
By the middle of the 2004–05 season, Lehmann&#x27;s inconsistent form lead to Spaniard Manuel Almunia starting in several matches instead. However, Almunia made a series of mistakes during several games, thus allowing Lehmann to regain his position. At the end of that season, as speculation again began to mount that he would be replaced over the summer, Lehmann cemented his position in the Arsenal goal with a man-of-the-match performance against Manchester United in the 2005 FA Cup Final. He made several important saves and demonstrated great positional sense to keep the score 0–0 after extra time, and then crucially saved Paul Scholes&#x27; shot in the penalty shootout, which Arsenal won 5–4.

====2005–06 season====
Lehmann had an outstanding 2005–06 season with Arsenal, making his 100th Premier League appearance for the club in their game against West Bromwich Albion on 15 April 2006. He was a key factor in his side&#x27;s first-ever accession to the Champions League final; during their run Arsenal broke the record for the most consecutive clean sheets in the Champions League with ten, breaking the record of seven that Milan had set just one year before. That run formed the bulk of an 853-minute spell without conceding a goal, overtaking the CL record for an individual goalkeeper set by Edwin van der Sar.

Bayern Munich&#x27;s Hasan Salihamidžić had been the last to net against Lehmann, in the 64th minute of a last 16 first leg match on 22 February 2005; Lehmann kept a clean sheet in the second leg, and then a further seven during Arsenal&#x27;s run in 2005–06 (Almunia played in the other five matches in the group stages). The final clean sheet was earned in the semi-finals against Villarreal, after Lehmann saved an 89th minute Juan Román Riquelme penalty. In the final against Barcelona, with the score still goalless, Lehmann was sent off in the 18th minute for a professional foul after bringing down Samuel Eto&#x27;o, making him the first player and – so far – only goalkeeper to ever be sent off in a Champions League/European Cup final. Arsenal would go on to lose 2–1 despite having the lead at half-time, but that did not stop him from being named the Champions League Goalkeeper of the Year for the 2005–06 season after going 853 minutes without conceding a goal.

====2006–07 season====
His remarkable run was finally ended on 13 September 2006 by Hamburger SV&#x27;s Boubacar Sanogo, who scored a consolation goal in the 89th minute of Arsenal&#x27;s first group stage match of the 2006–07 Champions League season.

Lehmann&#x27;s contract at Arsenal was due to expire in summer 2007 and during the 2006–07 season there was much speculation he would leave the club on a Bosman transfer. However, it was reported on 26 April 2007 that he had signed a year&#x27;s extension on his contract, tying him to the club until 2008.

====2007–08 season====

In the first league game of the 2007–08 season, Lehmann made a serious error after just 52 seconds, allowing David Healy to score for Fulham. However, Lehmann&#x27;s blushes were spared late in the game as Arsenal won 2–1. In his second league match against Blackburn Rovers he fumbled a David Dunn shot to allow Blackburn to equalise, in a game that finished 1–1. On 24 August, the BBC reported that he returned to Germany to treat an Achilles tendon injury which he picked up during international duty against England, meaning Manuel Almunia took his place for Arsenal&#x27;s third match.

Lehmann subsequently had to wait nearly four months to make another competitive appearance for Arsenal, which came in their final Champions League group match against Steaua Bucharest. Nearly one month later, he played only his fifth competitive game of the season for Arsenal, against Burnley in the third round of the FA Cup; meanwhile third-choice goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański was selected for the League Cup games. Lehmann expressed frustration at being number two to Manuel Almunia fearing it could cost him the number one jersey in the Germany national team for Euro 2008. However, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described Lehmann&#x27;s attitude as &quot;super-professional&quot;.

On 26 January 2008, Lehmann appeared in Arsenal&#x27;s second FA Cup game of the season, keeping his second successive clean sheet as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 3–0. Manager Arsène Wenger later promised Lehmann that, if he stayed at Arsenal, he would play every game in the FA Cup. On 29 January, Lehmann suggested that he will stick with Arsenal until his contract expires at the end of the season. Lehmann gave his reasons as his relationship with the fans, players, family situations and his chance to still be able to win things at the club; believing he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have had this chance somewhere else.&quot; On 2 February, following an injury to Almunia, Lehmann returned in goal for Arsenal in the Premiership for an away fixture against Manchester City, more than five months after his last league appearance; Arsenal won the match 3–1. Due to Almunia catching flu straight after the injury, Lehmann kept his place in goal for the following three matches in February, including the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 against Milan, but also the 4–0 loss to arch rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup.

After another injury to Almunia in early April 2008, Lehmann was back in goal for the away game against Manchester United on 13 April 2008. Arsenal lost that game 2–1, virtually ending their Premier League title hopes for the season, their third consecutive season without a major trophy. There was speculation that would be his last game for Arsenal, but on 19 April, Lehmann played in the home game against Reading, which Arsenal won 2–0. The following week, Łukasz Fabiański was given his Premier League debut against Derby County and Almunia returned to the bench for the game. However, Lehmann made another appearance and was brought on for Fabiański in the last 20 minutes of the game against Everton on 4 May, Arsenal&#x27;s final home game of the season. He was given a standing ovation after the match as he bowed and clapped to the fans. Later that day, Wenger confirmed that it was Lehmann&#x27;s farewell appearance.

===VfB Stuttgart===
In early June 2008, it was announced that Lehmann had signed a one-year contract for VfB Stuttgart. He joined the team&#x27;s pre-season training on 24 July 2008, and made his debut for the club on 30 July 2008 in a friendly match against former team Arsenal. His competitive debut for the club came on 10 August 2008 in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, a 5–0 away victory over FC Hansa Lüneburg, and his Bundesliga debut one week later in Stuttgart&#x27;s 3–1 away victory at Borussia Mönchengladbach.

On 3 April 2009, Lehmann extended his contract at VfB Stuttgart until the summer of 2010 and announced in August 2009 that he would retire on 30 June 2010.

===Return to Arsenal===
On 14 March 2011, German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; reported that Lehmann was in talks to come out of retirement, due to an injury crisis at Arsenal leaving them with only one fit senior keeper, Manuel Almunia. Lehmann was also scheduled to spend six weeks working on his coaching badges at his old club. Due to the injury of Arsenal goalkeepers Wojciech Szczęsny, Łukasz Fabiański and Vito Mannone, on 17 March 2011 Lehmann signed for Arsenal on a rolling contract until the end of the season. Lehmann was named as a substitute in Arsenal&#x27;s match against West Bromwich Albion on 19 March 2011. Despite newspaper reports that he might replace Almunia, due to the Spaniard&#x27;s poor performances, Lehmann made his first appearance in Arsenal&#x27;s reserves on 29 March 2011 against Wigan, when Arsenal lost 2–1.

On 10 April 2011, Lehmann started for the first team in an away game against Blackpool. He was forced to start the game when Almunia was injured in the warm up. Winning 3–1, it was his 200th appearance for Arsenal. Lehmann became the oldest player to play for Arsenal in the Premier League but not the oldest to play for the Gunners in all competitions, a record held by Jock Rutherford. Lehmann&#x27;s contract with Arsenal expired at the end of the season, and then he decided to retire once again.

On 8 September 2018, a match was organised between Arsenal legends and Real Madrid legends in which Lehmann appeared after David Seaman picked up injury during training. He eventually made two saves in the second half and then saved a shot from Alfonso in the subsequent penalty shoot out. Arsenal legends won 5–3 on penalties, with Lehmann scoring the last penalty for Arsenal.

==International career==

Lehmann made his debut for the Germany national team against Oman in February 1998 and earned 61 caps for his country, 32 of which were friendlies.

He had a well-publicised rivalry with former Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, whose presence long prevented Lehmann from becoming the number one goalkeeper of the national team. Lehmann was in the squad which finished as runners-up in the 2002 World Cup, but he didn&#x27;t play any matches in the competition, as Kahn was still Germany&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper.

On 7 April 2006, however, Germany national coach Jürgen Klinsmann announced that Lehmann would be Germany&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper for the upcoming World Cup. Lehmann conceded two goals in Germany&#x27;s opening match of the World Cup, both scored by Costa Rica&#x27;s Paulo Wanchope although Germany won the match 4–2. Lehmann played strongly in the next three games, conceding no goals and allowing Germany to sweep their group undefeated and beat Sweden convincingly in the Round of 16.

The highlight of Lehmann&#x27;s international career came in the quarterfinal match (30 June 2006, Olympiastadion, Berlin) against Argentina. The game remained tied 1–1 after 90 minutes and extra time. The game came down to penalty kicks and Lehmann carried his team through, picking the right direction for all spot kicks, making saves from Argentinians Roberto Ayala and Esteban Cambiasso and almost saving a third. Meanwhile, the Germans made all four of the necessary spot kicks to win the penalty shoot-out 4–2. Lehmann&#x27;s prowess in the shootout was aided by notes given to him before the kicks – an idea from Germany&#x27;s chief scout, Swiss-born Urs Siegenthaler. Germany&#x27;s goalkeeping manager, Andreas Köpke, gave Lehmann a sheet of paper with the penalty tendencies of seven of the Argentinians, with Lehmann keeping the paper in his right sock. Only two of the seven players on the note (Ayala and Maxi Rodríguez) ended up taking penalties, but Köpke had predicted both correctly and Lehmann saved Ayala&#x27;s kick. Before the last shot from Cambiasso, Lehmann looked at the paper for a long time even though Cambiasso&#x27;s name was not even on it. Lehmann then saved the penalty, ending the game. The story about the paper features in the film &quot;Deutschland. Ein Sommermärchen&quot;. Lehmann was considered a hero by the German public after these saves, and he received praise even from long-time rival and backup keeper Oliver Kahn.

Germany&#x27;s opponent in the semifinals was Italy. The Italians had the better chances to score but Lehmann made several spectacular saves, including one in extra time where he dived out of goal to intercept an Italian player who had broken loose from the defence, punching the ball clear with his fist and temporarily knocking out the Italian in the process. He allowed two goals within a minute of each other with only a few seconds remaining in extra time, which put Italy into the World Cup final. The retiring Oliver Kahn was given the honour of starting in the third place play-off match, an offer made by Lehmann himself. Kahn was made captain for that game due to the injury to Michael Ballack. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 for the third place (bronze) medals.

In August 2006, Lehmann revealed that during the World Cup he was suffering with a foot injury that he claims was a result of wearing different boots. The German Football Association ordered their players to wear only those manufactured by principal sponsor Adidas as opposed to Lehmann&#x27;s sponsor Nike. This has now been overturned thanks to Lehmann and several other players protesting about the decision and the players are now free to wear boots made by other companies. The same month, Lehmann suggested that he may retire from league and international football after playing for Germany in Euro 2008. However, he subsequently stated in January 2007 that he had not made any decision on retirement.

Lehmann set a national team record of not conceding a goal for 681 minutes in a friendly against Switzerland on 26 March 2008. In Euro 2008, he was one of only two players born in the 1960s, with the other being Austria&#x27;s Ivica Vastić. Lehmann started every match as Germany reached the final. They lost 1–0 to Spain; a lack of communication between Lehmann and Philipp Lahm allowed Spain&#x27;s Fernando Torres to net the only goal in the match.

On 8 August 2008, Lehmann announced his retirement from international football. He made his decision following a two-hour talk with the Germany national team&#x27;s coach Joachim Löw and goalkeeping coach Andreas Köpke, stating that he was not able to give them any guarantee that he will continue to play football following the end of his one-year contract with VfB Stuttgart in June 2009. He has since retired and subsequently worked towards his full FIFA coaching license at Arsenal.

==Style of play==

Considered to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world in his prime, as well as one of the best goalkeepers in the history of the Premier League, and one of Arsenal&#x27;s and Germany&#x27;s greatest goalkeepers, Lehmann was a talented and experienced keeper, who was renowned for his agility, reflexes, strength, and acrobatic shot-stopping abilities; however, he was also known for his efficiency rather than spectacular playing style. A well–rounded goalkeeper, he was also highly regarded in the media for his distribution with either foot, as well as his handling, physical presence, positioning, reading of the game, and his ability to come off his line and collect or punch crosses, which allowed him to command his area effectively. He was also known for his eccentric personality, and for being extremely outspoken. Moreover, he possessed a strong mentality, tactical sense, and leadership qualities, and was also known for his ability to handle pressure and communicate with his back–line. One of the best goalkeepers of his generation, his playing style served as an inspiration for Manuel Neuer. However, despite his ability, he was also known to be inconsistent at times.

==Post-retirement==
Ahead of the 2017–18 season, it was confirmed that Lehmann would return to Arsenal once again as assistant coach. On 19 June 2018, Arsenal confirmed that Lehmann had left the club as part of new head coach Unai Emery&#x27;s coaching staff changes.

On 29 January 2019, he was appointed assistant coach of FC Augsburg alongside Manuel Baum, as the team were only 15th in the Bundesliga.

In May 2020, &quot;Tennor Holding BV&quot; named Lehmann, among others, as its representative on the supervisory board of Hertha BSC. One year later, he was sacked after sending pundit and former footballer Dennis Aogo a WhatsApp message calling him a &quot;quota black guy&quot;, in relation to Aogo&#x27;s work as an expert at Sky. Lehmann had previously apologized via a Twitter post.

==Personal life==
Lehmann and his elder brother grew up in Essen. After graduating from secondary school with A-levels (&quot;Abitur&quot;) in 1988, he studied economics at the University of Münster between 1992 and 1998 while continuing his football career.

In 1999, he married Conny, a middle school teacher. Lehmann later adopted Lasse, Conny’s son from her previous marriage to footballer Knut Reinhardt. The pair also have two children.

In September 2024, Lehmann was fined €135,000 by a court in Starnberg for damaging his neighbour&#x27;s garage with a chainsaw.

===Charity===

He is board member of the youth football foundation Stiftung Jugendfußball, founded 2000 upon the initiative of Jürgen Klinsmann. Lehmann also acts as ambassador of the foundation Power-Child Campus South Africa that supports children affected by HIV and well as foundations of Bert Trautmann, Christoph Metzelder and former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson.

He participated in the Soccer Aid football match on 6 June 2010 for the Rest of the World team in aid of UNICEF.

===Acting appearances===
Lehmann made his film acting debut with the German/South African production &quot;Themba&quot;. He plays Big John Jacobs, a football coach and talent scout, who discovers Themba, a young and ambitious youth, who is faced with poverty, AIDS and violence, but eventually makes his way on to the South African national team. The movie is based on a novel by Lutz van Dijk and premiered at the Berlinale 2010.

<text>Bank of Scotland (Ireland) Limited was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland, which later became part of Lloyds Banking Group. It offered commercial and corporate banking services under the Bank of Scotland brand and retail banking services under the Halifax brand. From 10 February 2010 the bank no longer accepted new business and it ceased to operate as a licensed bank on 31 December 2010. The assets of the bank were merged into Bank of Scotland plc.

==History==
The company was founded in 1965 as Equity Bank Limited. In 1999, it was purchased by the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland. Later, the parent company established its own brand in the Irish market through the direct sales of mortgages from Edinburgh. Following this, it was decided to rebrand the existing Irish operation as Bank of Scotland (Ireland) in 2000.

In 2001, the bank purchased ICC Bank plc from the Irish State. This company, originally established as the &quot;Industrial Credit Company&quot;, and later known as &quot;Industrial Credit Corporation plc&quot;, was set up in 1933 by Seán Lemass in the Irish Free State to encourage investment in industry. The company was modelled on the Agricultural Credit Corporation (later renamed ACC Loan Management, also defunct).

In 2004, the company took over the direct mortgage sales business from its parent company, and moved it to Dublin. Major new offices were also opened in a brand new building in Limerick, named &quot;Bank of Scotland House&quot; (formerly the site of the Carlton Cinema).

In 2005, the company announced that it was taking over the Electricity Supply Board&#x27;s ShopElectric chain of retail outlets, and turn them into a network of branches. This made the company the fourth-largest bank in Ireland, with 46 branches. The company detailed its retail banking plans on 10 January 2006, the first three branches opened the following day, as well as a call centre in Dundalk, County Louth. This put it in direct competition with Permanent TSB as well as National Irish Bank, the smallest of the traditional &quot;Big Four&quot;. The banks became the first Irish bank to open on Saturday as standard.

Following the merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland to form HBOS, in August 2006, the bank announced that it would adopt a two-brand strategy, re-branding as Halifax for its retail business and retaining the Bank of Scotland name for its commercial customers.

In 2007, Halifax announced the launch a personal current account paying 10% interest on credit balances up to €2000 to customers lodging €1500 or more per month. The bank further announced that it was the first in Ireland to offer a Visa Debit card rather than the Laser debit card issued by other Irish banks back then, which had restricted usability outside Ireland.

==Closure==
On 9 February 2010 Bank of Scotland announced that it would be shutting all of its 44 retail branches in the Republic in addition to its customer service centre in Dundalk and direct support functions with a loss of 750 jobs. Halifax cited the economic crisis at the time as the main reason for this decision. The Bank, in its online press release, stated that the commercial and corporate strands of the business in Ireland would remain unaffected. Bank of Scotland (Ireland) chief executive, Joe Higgins, said : &quot;We have arrived at this difficult position only after an extensive and exhaustive review of all options to secure a viable future for the bank overall and for these businesses.&quot;

However, in August 2010, it was announced that the remaining business of Bank of Scotland Ireland was to be wound down by the end of the year. This followed losses of 1.88 billion euro in the first six months of the year, due mainly to impaired loans to property developers.

<text>Paul Abbott (born 22 February 1960) is an English screenwriter and producer. He became one of the most successful television writers in Britain following his work on popular series such as &quot;Cracker&quot; (1995, 1996, 1999) and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (1987–1989, 1991–1993), and would become more widely known for creating some of the most acclaimed television dramas of the 1990s and 2000s, including &quot;Reckless&quot; (1997), &quot;Touching Evil&quot; (1997–1999), &quot;Clocking Off&quot; (2000–2003), &quot;State of Play&quot; (2003), &quot;Shameless&quot; (2004–2013), and &quot;No Offence&quot; (2015–2018).

==Early life==
Abbott was born into a dysfunctional family in Burnley on 22 February 1960, the seventh of eight children. When he was nine, his mother left to pursue a relationship with another man who had a child around Abbott&#x27;s own age; his father, whom Abbott described as &quot;bone idle&quot;, departed two years later. His mother had supported the family with three jobs. Abbott and his siblings were left in the care of their pregnant 17-year-old sister. His father did not claim benefits for the family for fear of alerting social services to their abandonment. Although he constantly skipped school, Abbott later cited his English teacher at Barden High School as an early positive influence on him.

Abbott was raped by a stranger at the age of 11, leading to him jumping from the roof of a multi-story car park in an attempt to take his own life. Two years later, after another suicide attempt, he was committed to an adult mental hospital; he later became a voluntary patient. On his release, he was taken into foster care and placed with a much more settled working-class family, where having two parents who held steady employment and owned a television and car was a new experience for him. At the same time, he began attending a local Sixth Form College and started attending meetings of the Burnley Writers&#x27; Circle after seeing their advert in the local public library. He enrolled at the University of Manchester in 1980 to study psychology, but decided to leave to concentrate on writing when a radio play he wrote was accepted by the BBC.

==Career==
Abbott entered the &quot;Radio Times&quot; drama competition at the age of 22 which had the requirement to find a professional sponsor. A contact knew the address of the leading British dramatist Alan Bennett who, after seeing his script, was of the opinion that Abbott had written a perfectly acceptable piece of work which he would be happy to endorse. His work on radio plays for BBC Radio 4 attracted the attention of producers at Granada Television who hired him, at age twenty-four, to be a script editor on their long-running soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. This made him at the time the youngest-ever person to occupy such a role on the programme.

He worked on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for the next eight years as a story editor and from 1989 as a writer. He also worked on other programmes for Granada. In 1988, he co-wrote his first televised drama script, a one-off play for the &quot;Dramarama&quot; anthology, with fellow &quot;Coronation Street&quot; writer Kay Mellor. The same year, he and Mellor co-created the children&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot;, which ran for many years—Abbott regularly contributed scripts until 1992, then returned briefly to the show in 1996.

In 1994, he worked as the producer on the second season of Granada&#x27;s drama series &quot;Cracker&quot;, about the work of a criminal psychologist played by Robbie Coltrane. The following year he switched to writing scripts for the programme and wrote several episodes. He made his first breakthrough with a programme of his own creation, the police drama serial &quot;Touching Evil&quot; in 1997. The series, starring popular actor Robson Green, was a success, and two sequel serials—although not written by Abbott—followed. Most recently, in 2004, the series was re-made for American television by the USA Network.

After writing another serial starring Green, &quot;Reckless&quot; and a few other productions for Granada, he began in 1999 a collaboration with the independent Red Production Company. He contributed an episode to their anthology series &quot;Love in the 21st Century&quot;, screened on Channel 4, and in 2000 created and wrote the series &quot;Clocking Off&quot; for them, which was screened on BBC One. Set in one factory in Lancashire, the series focused on a different member of factory staff each episode. The first season won the BAFTA award for Best Drama Series, and the equivalent at the Royal Television Society awards; Abbott personally was recognised with the RTS Best Writer award. &quot;Clocking Off&quot; ran for four seasons, although Abbott&#x27;s contributions to the final two runs were minimal as he was by this time busy working on other projects.

In 2001, he created another Red series screened on BBC One, the comedy-drama &quot;Linda Green&quot;; although this was somewhat less successful and ran for only two seasons before cancellation. In 2000, he was due to adapt the D. H. Lawrence novel &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; as a four-part television serial but pulled out due to work commitments.

2002 saw Abbott experimenting with a new genre when he wrote the political thriller &quot;State of Play&quot;, which was directed by David Yates and produced for the BBC by Hilary Bevan-Jones. In late 2003, Abbott and Bevan-Jones founded their own independent production company, Tightrope Pictures, based in Soho, London.

In early 2004, Channel 4 screened &quot;Shameless&quot;, a new Abbott series very loosely based on his experiences and family life growing up in Burnley, although the action of the programme itself was changed to Manchester in the present day. At the 2006 British Academy Television Awards, he was given the honorary Dennis Potter Award for Outstanding Writing in Television, and in July of the same year &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine placed him at No. 5 in a poll of industry professionals to find The Most Powerful People in Television Drama. Abbott was the highest-placed writer on the list, those above him being actors and executives.

Tightrope Pictures have produced several high-profile dramas for the BBC, including Richard Curtis&#x27;s &quot;The Girl in the Café&quot; (also directed by David Yates for BBC One, 2005) and an adaptation of William Golding&#x27;s novel &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot; (BBC Two, 2005). In 2009, Abbott acted as executive producer on the film version of &quot;State of Play&quot; for Universal Pictures.

The first series of &quot;No Offence&quot; aired on Channel 4 beginning in May 2015. In 2021, Sky Max would broadcast Abbott&#x27;s newest crime series, &quot;Wolfe&quot;.

==Academic recognition==

In July 2006, it was announced that the University of Salford had appointed Abbott as a visiting professor; the same month, Manchester Metropolitan University awarded him with an honorary doctorate. His November 2006 lecture at Salford entitled &quot;The 21st Century Box&quot; explored how media is changing and provided &quot;first aid for British television makers&quot;. Attendees included the Mayor and Mayoress of Salford.

In 2013, Dr. Beth Johnson from the University of Leeds published the first book-length academic study of Abbott&#x27;s work alongside Manchester University Press.

In 2015, Abbott was awarded an honorary doctorate from Keele University.

<text>Thomas Thirlby (or Thirleby; –1570), was the first and only bishop of Westminster (1540–50), and afterwards successively bishop of Norwich (1550–54) and bishop of Ely (1554–59). While he acquiesced in the Henrician schism, with its rejection in principle of the Roman papacy, he remained otherwise loyal to the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church during the English Reformation.

==Life==
Thomas, was the son of John Thirleby, scrivener and town clerk of Cambridge, and Joan his wife, and was born in the parish of St. Mary the Great, Cambridge, in or about 1506. He received his education at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, graduated bachelor of the civil law in 1521, was elected a fellow of his college, and proceeded doctor of the civil law in 1528, and doctor of the canon law in 1530. It is said that while at the university he, with other learned men who were the favourers of the gospel, though they afterwards relapsed, received an allowance from Queen Anne Boleyn, the Earl of Wiltshire, her father, and Lord Rochford, her brother. In 1532 he was official to the archdeacon of Ely. He appears to have taken a prominent part in the affairs of the university between 1528 and 1534, and is supposed to have held the office of commissary. In 1534 he was appointed provost of the collegiate church of St. Edmund at Salisbury. Archbishop Cranmer and Dr. Butts, physician to the king, were his early patrons. Cranmer &quot;liked his learning and his qualities so well that he became his good lord towards the king&#x27;s majesty, and commended him to him, to be a man worthy to serve a prince, for such singular qualities as were in him. And indeed the king soon employed him in embassies in France and elsewhere: so that he grew in the king&#x27;s favour by the means of the archbishop, who had a very extraordinary love for him, and thought nothing too much to give him or to do for him.&quot;

In 1533 he was one of the king&#x27;s chaplains, and in May communicated to Cranmer &quot;the king&#x27;s commands&quot; relative to the sentence of divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In 1534 he was presented by the king to the archdeaconry of Ely, and he was a member of the convocation which recognised the king&#x27;s supremacy in ecclesiastical matters. Soon afterwards he was appointed dean of the chapel royal, and in 1536 one of the members of the council of the north. On 29 September 1537 the king granted to him a canonry and prebend in the collegiate church of St. Stephen, in the palace of Westminster, and on the 15th of the following month he was present at the christening of Prince Edward (afterwards Edward VI) at Hampton Court. On 2 May 1538 a royal commission was issued to Stephen Gardiner, Sir Francis Brian, and Thirlby, as ambassadors, to treat with Francis I, king of France, not only for a league of friendship, but for the projected marriage of the Princess Mary to the Duke of Orleans. The three ambassadors were recalled in August 1538. Thirlby was one of the royal commissioners appointed on 1 October 1538 to search for and examine anabaptists. On 23 December 1539 he was presented to the mastership of the hospital of St. Thomas à Becket in Southwark, and on 14 January 1539/40 he surrendered that house, with all its possessions, to the king. At this period he was prebendary of Yeatminster in the cathedral church of Salisbury, and rector of Ribchester, Lancashire. In 1540 he was prolocutor of the convocation of the province of Canterbury, and signed the decree declaring the nullity of the king&#x27;s marriage with Anne of Cleves. In the same year he was one of the commissioners appointed by the king to deliberate upon sundry points of religion then in controversy, and especially upon the doctrine of the sacraments.

By letters patent dated 17 December 1540 the king erected the abbey of Westminster into an episcopal see, and appointed Thirlby the first and, as it happened, the last bishop of the new Diocese of Westminster. He was consecrated on 29 December in St. Saviour&#x27;s Chapel in the cathedral church of Westminster. Soon afterwards he was appointed by the convocation to revise the translation of the epistles of St. James, St. John, and St. Jude. In January 1540–1 he interceded with the crown for the grant of the university of the house of Franciscan friars at Cambridge. In 1542 he appears as a member of the privy council, and was also despatched as ambassador to the emperor in Spain. He returned the same year. In April 1543 he took part in the revision of the &quot;Institution of a Christian Man&quot;, and on 17 June in that year he was one of those empowered to treat with the Scots ambassador concerning the proposed marriage of Prince Edward with Mary Queen of Scots. In May 1545 he was despatched on an embassy to the emperor, Charles V. He attended the diet of Bourbourg, and on 16 January 1546–7 he was one of those who signed a treaty of peace at Utrecht. He was not named an executor by Henry VIII and consequently was excluded from Edward VI&#x27;s privy council. He remained at the court of the emperor till June 1548, taking leave of Charles V at Augsburg on the 11th. Thirlby took part in the important debates in the House of Lords in December 1548 and January 1548–9 on the subject of the sacrament of the altar and the sacrifice of the mass. He declared that &quot;he did never allow the doctrine&quot; laid down in the communion office of the proposed first Book of Common Prayer, stating that he mainly objected to the book as it stood because it abolished the &quot;elevation&quot; and the &quot;adoration&quot;. When Somerset expressed to Edward VI some disappointment at Thirlby&#x27;s attitude, the young king remarked, &quot;I expected nothing else but that he, who had been so long time with the emperor, should smell of the Interim.&quot; He voted against the third reading of the act of uniformity on 15 January 1548–9, but enforced its provisions in his diocese after it had been passed. On 12 April 1549 he was in the commission for the suppression of heresy, and on 10 November in that year he was ambassador at Brussels with Sir Philip Hoby and Sir Thomas Cheyne. On 29 March 1550 Thirlby resigned the bishopric of Westminster into the hands of the king, who thereupon dissolved it, and reannexed the county of Middlesex, which had been assigned for its diocese, to the see of London. While bishop of Westminster he is said to have &quot;impoverished the church.&quot;

On 1 April, following his resignation of the see of Westminster, he was constituted bishop of Norwich. Bishop Burnet intimates that Thirlby was removed from Westminster to Norwich, as it was thought he could do less mischief in the latter see, &quot;for though he complied as soon as any change was made, yet he secretly opposed everything while it was safe to do.&quot; In January 1550–1 he was appointed one of the commissioners to correct and punish all anabaptists, and such as did not duly administer the sacraments according to the Book of Common Prayer; and on 15 April 1551 one of the commissioners to determine a controversy respecting the borders of England and Scotland. On 20 May following he was in a commission to treat for a marriage between the king and Elizabeth, daughter of Henry II of France. He was in 1551 appointed one of the masters of requests, and he was also one of the numerous witnesses on the trial of Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, which took place in that year. In January and March 1551–2 his name was inserted in several commissions appointed to inquire what sums were due to the king or his father for sale of lands; to raise money by the sale of crown lands to the yearly value of 1,000£; and to survey the state of all the courts erected for the custody of the king&#x27;s lands. In April 1553 he was again appointed ambassador to the Emperor Charles V, at whose court he remained until April 1554. On his return from Germany he brought with him one Remegius, who established a paper mill in this country—perhaps at Fen Ditton, near Cambridge.

At heart a Roman Catholic, Thirlby was soon high in Queen Mary&#x27;s favour, and in July 1554 he was translated from Norwich to Ely, the temporalities of the latter see being delivered to him on 15 September. He was one of the prelates who presided at the trials of Bishop Hooper, John Rogers, Rowland Taylor, and others, for heresy; and in February 1554–5 he was appointed, together with Anthony Browne, viscount Montague, and Sir Edward Carne, a special ambassador to the pope, to make the queen&#x27;s obedience, and to obtain a confirmation of all those graces which Cardinal Pole had granted in his name. He returned to London from Rome on 24 August 1555 with a bull confirming the queen&#x27;s title to Ireland, which document he delivered to the lord treasurer on 10 December. A curious journal of this embassy is printed in Lord Hardwicke&#x27;s &quot;State Papers&quot;.

After the death of the lord chancellor, Gardiner, on 12 November 1555, Mary proposed to confer on Thirlby the vacant office, but Philip objected, and Archbishop Heath was appointed. In January 1555–6 Thirlby took a part in the degradation of his old friend Archbishop Cranmer. &quot;He was observed to weep much all the while; he protested to Cranmer that it was the most sorrowful action of his whole life, and acknowledged the great love and friendship that had been between them; and that no earthly consideration but the queen&#x27;s command could have induced him to come and do what they were then about.&quot; On 22 March following he was one of the seven bishops who assisted at the consecration of Cardinal Pole as archbishop of Canterbury. In 1556 he was appointed to receive Osep Napea Gregoriwitch (ru), ambassador from the emperor of Russia. Thirlby appears to have sanctioned the burning of John Hullier for heresy in 1556, but only two others, William Wolsey and Robert Pygot of Wisbech, suffered death in his diocese on account of their religion, and it has been said that &quot;Thirleby was in no way interested therein; but the guilt thereof must be shared between Dr. Fuller, the chancellor, and other commissioners.&quot; In April 1558 Thirlby was sent to the north to inquire the cause of the quarrel between the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland. He and Dr. Nicholas Wotton were Queen Mary&#x27;s commissioners to treat with France respecting the restoration of Calais and the conclusion of peace. Queen Elizabeth sent a new commission to them at Cambray in January 1558–9, and instructed the Earl of Arundel to act in conjunction with them. The commissioners succeeded in concluding peace, and returned home in April 1559. The queen is said to have cast upon Thirlby the entire blame of the eventual loss of Calais. Queen Mary had appointed him one of her executors.

On the assembling of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s first parliament Thirlby sent his proxy, he being then absent on his embassy in France. On 17 April 1559 the bill for restoring ecclesiastical jurisdiction to the crown was committed to him and other peers. He opposed this measure on the third reading. He also dissented from the bill for uniformity of common prayer. He refused to take the oath of supremacy, and for this reason he and Archbishop Heath were deposed from their sees on 5 July 1559 at the lord-treasurer&#x27;s house in Broad Street.

According to Bentham, Thirlby was a considerable benefactor to the see of Ely because by his interest he procured from the crown for himself and his successors the patronage of the prebends in the cathedral; but Dr. Cox, his immediate successor, asserted that although Thirlby received £500 from Bishop Goodrich&#x27;s executors for dilapidations, he left his houses, bridges, lodes, rivers, causeways, and banks, in great ruin and decay, and spoiled the see of a stock of one thousand marks, which his predecessors had enjoyed since the reign of Edward III. He also alleged that Thirlby never came into his diocese.

After his deprivation Thirlby had his liberty for some time, but in consequence of his persisting in preaching against the Reformation, he was on 3 June 1560 committed to the Tower, and on 25 February 1560–1 he was excommunicated. In September 1563 he was removed from the Tower on account of the plague to Archbishop Parker&#x27;s house at Beaksbourne. In June 1564 he was transferred to Lambeth Palace, and Parker, who is said to have treated Thirlby with great courtesy and respect, even permitted him to lodge for some time at the house of one Mrs. Blackwell in Blackfriars. He died in Lambeth Palace on 26 August 1570. He was buried on the 28th in the chancel of Lambeth church, under a stone with a brief Latin inscription in brass. In making a grave for the burial of Archbishop Cornwallis in March 1783, the body of Bishop Thirlby was discovered in his coffin, in a great measure undecayed, as was the clothing. The corpse had a cap on its head and a hat under its arm. His portrait is in the print of the delivery of the charter of Bridewell.

<text>Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta (22 January 182924 November 1914) was an Italian statesman. He is one of the longest-serving Ministers of Foreign Affairs in the history of Italy.

==Biography ==
Visconti-Venosta was born in Milan, in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia. He studied jurisprudence at the University of Pavia.

A disciple of Mazzini, he took part in all the anti-Austrian conspiracies until the ineffectual rising at Milan on 6 February 1853, of which he had foretold the failure, induced him to renounce his Mazzinian allegiance. Continuing, nevertheless, his anti-Austrian propaganda, he rendered good service to the national cause, but being molested by the Austrian police, was obliged in 1859 to escape to Turin, and during the war with Austria of that year was appointed by Cavour royal commissioner with the Garibaldian forces.

Elected deputy in 1860, he accompanied Luigi Carlo Farini on diplomatic missions to Modena and Naples, and was subsequently despatched to London and Paris to acquaint the British and French governments with the course of events in Italy. As a recompense for the tact displayed on this occasion, he was given by Cavour a permanent appointment in the Italian foreign office, and was subsequently appointed under-secretary of state by Count Pasolini. Upon the latter&#x27;s death he became Minister of Foreign Affairs (March 24, 1863) in the Minghetti cabinet, in which capacity he negotiated the September Convention for the evacuation of Rome by the French troops.

Resigning office with Minghetti in the autumn of 1864, he was in March 1866 sent by la Marmora as minister to Constantinople, but was almost immediately recalled and reappointed foreign minister by Ricasoli. Assuming office on the morrow of the Italian defeat at Custoza, he succeeded in preventing Austria from burdening Italy with a proportion of the Austrian imperial debt, in addition to the Venetian debt proper. The fall of Ricasoli in February 1867 deprived him for a time of his office, but in December 1869 he entered the Lanza-Sella cabinet as foreign minister, and retained his portfolio in the succeeding Minghetti cabinet until the fall of the Right in 1876.

During this long period he was called upon to conduct the delicate negotiations connected with the Franco-Prussian War, the Capture of Rome by the Italians, and the consequent destruction of the temporal power of the Pope, the Law of Guarantees and the visits of Victor Emmanuel II to Vienna and Berlin. Upon the occasion of his marriage with the daughter of the Marquis Alfieri di Sostegno, grand-niece of Cavour, he was created marquis by the king. For a time he remained a member of the parliamentary opposition, and in 1886 was nominated senator.

In 1894, after eighteen years&#x27; absence from active political life, he was chosen to be Italian arbitrator in the Bering Sea question, and in 1896 once more accepted the portfolio of foreign affairs in the Di Rudinì cabinet at a juncture when the disastrous First Italo-Ethiopian War and the indiscreet publication of an Abyssinian Green Book had rendered the international position of Italy exceedingly difficult. His first care was to improve Franco-Italian relations by negotiating with France a treaty with regard to Tunis. During the negotiations relating to the Cretan question and the Graeco-Turkish War he secured for Italy a worthy part in the European Concert and joined Lord Salisbury in saving Greece from the loss of Thessaly.

Resigning office in May 1898, on a question of internal policy, he once more retired to private life.

In May 1899 he again assumed the management of foreign affairs in the second Pelloux cabinet, and continued to hold office in the succeeding Saracco cabinet until its fall in February 1901. During this period his attention was devoted chiefly to the Boxer Rebellion and to the maintenance of the equilibrium in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. In regard to the Mediterranean he established an Italo-French agreement by which France tacitly undertook to leave Italy a free hand in Tripoli, and Italy not to interfere with French policy in the interior of Morocco; and, in regard to the Adriatic, he came to an understanding with Austria-Hungary guaranteeing the &quot;status quo&quot; in Albania.

Prudence (dubbed as &quot;clean hands policy&quot;){{efn|On the other side, the &quot;clean hands&quot; policy in diplomacy was judged, in next century, &quot;a dramatic cultural heritage, which Italy should escape now more than ever&quot;: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title=Elezioni europee e nuovo trattato di Lisbona|journal=L&#x27;Ago e Il Filo Edizione Online|date=2013|url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89409117|access-date=2016-04-10|archive-date=2012-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801002834/http://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89409117|url-status=dead}} and sagacity, coupled with unequalled experience of foreign policy, enabled him to assure to Italy her full portion of influence in international affairs, and secured for himself the unanimous esteem of European cabinets. In recognition of his services he was created Knight of the Annunziata by Victor Emmanuel III on the occasion of the birth of Princess Yolanda of Savoy (June 1, 1901).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In February 1906 he was Italian delegate to the Algeciras Conference.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The purpose of the conference was to mediate the First Moroccan Crisis between France and Germany, and to assure the repayment of a large loan made to the Sultan in 1904. After this conference, Visconti-Venosta retired from public life. On account of his great experience, profound legal and political culture and sound judgment, he was often consulted by the Italian government, especially on questions of foreign affairs. He explicitly approved of Italy&#x27;s declaration of neutrality on the outbreak of World War I. He died in Rome on 24th November 1914.{{sfn|Chisholm|1922}}

<doc id="837969" wikidata="Q256298" url="?curid=837969" title="List of Delaware state parks">
<text>The U.S. state of Delaware has 17 state parks. Each of the parks is operated and maintained by the Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation, a branch of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), although one state park, First State Heritage Park, is managed by the Division of Parks and Recreation in partnership with other city and state agencies.

Each of Delaware&#x27;s three counties has at least one state park, with New Castle having the most. Wilmington State Parks, despite being administratively managed as a single unit, is further broken down into several smaller parks. The state park system includes over 26,600 acres of land and over 170 miles of trails.

In 2015, Delaware State Parks won the Gold Medal honoring the best state parks system in the country from the National Recreation and Park Association. It was the tenth state to win the award since it was started in 1997.

==Overview==
Delaware&#x27;s oldest public lands date back to 1682 when, upon his arrival as proprietor of the colony, William Penn instructed his deputies to set aside land that is now Cape Henlopen State Park and its natural resources to be held in trust for the common good of all the citizens. The earliest attempts at legislating protection of a formalized public parks system were the result of efforts by conservationist William Poole Bancroft, who recognized the beauty of northern Delaware and in the late 19th century became determined to see it preserved for the benefit of future generations. Bancroft also donated many acres of his own land to form public parks as well as created a trust to manage and acquire land for the development of parks after his death.

Several of the state parks in northern Delaware were at one time either partially or wholly owned by estates belonging to members of the Du Pont family that were acquired by the state after the deaths of family members. Several other state parks throughout Delaware were converted from former military installations that were determined to be surplus property.

Three of northern Delaware&#x27;s state parks (Alapocas Run, Brandywine Creek, and Wilmington) exist to protect pieces of the historic Brandywine River, which was once heavily utilized by local industry. Four of southern Delaware&#x27;s state parks (Cape Henlopen, Delaware Seashore, Fenwick Island, and Holts Landing) preserve stretches of ocean and bay beaches, which are very popular in summer months.

<text>Cesare Francesco Ricotti Magnani (June 30, 1822 - August 4, 1917) was an Italian general who served as Minister of War of the Kingdom of Italy.

==Biography==
He was born at Borgolavezzaro, near Novara.

As artillery lieutenant, he distinguished himself and was wounded at the Siege of Peschiera del Garda in 1848, and in 1852 gained further distinction by his efforts to prevent the explosion of a burning powder magazine. After serving from 1856 to 1859. as Director of the Artillery School, he became General of Division in 1864, commanding the 5th Division at the Battle of San Martino.

In the war of 1866 he stormed Borgoforte, to open a passage for Cialdini&#x27;s army. Upon the death of General Govone in 1872 he was appointed Minister of War, and after the occupation of Rome bent all his efforts to army reform, in accordance with the lessons of the Franco-German War. He shortened the period of military service, extended conscription to all able-bodied men, created a permanent army, a mobile militia and a reserve, commenced the renewal of armaments, and placed Italy in a position to put 1,800,000 men on a war footing. He was also responsible, after the suggestion made by Captain Giuseppe Perrucchetti, for the foundation of the Alpini, the first established infantry corps specialized in mountain warfare, for the defense of Italy&#x27;s mountainous borders.

Ricotti fell from power with the Right in 1876, but returned to office with Depretis in 1884, and amended his previous scheme of reform. Resigning in April 1887, he became a member of the senate in 1890, but took little part in public life until 1896, when, after the Battle of Adowa, he was entrusted by King Humbert with the formation of a cabinet.

Having constructed his ministry, he made over the premiership to the Marquis di Rudinì, retaining for himself the portfolio of war, and seeking to satisfy popular demands for the reduction of military expenditure by consolidating the tactical structure of the army without weakening its fighting power. Rudinì, however, finding that Ricotti&#x27;s ideas, which he himself shared, were not acceptable at court, obliged him to resign office. His prestige as creator of the modern Italian army remained unimpaired, and his views on army consolidation enjoyed a large measure of technical and public favour.

<doc id="837999" wikidata="Q1404436" url="?curid=837999" title="Felt (band)">
<text>Felt were an English jangle pop band, formed in 1979 in Water Orton, Warwickshire, and led by the mononymous Lawrence. They were active for ten years through the 1980s, releasing ten singles and ten albums, although none reached the UK singles chart or albums chart. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by Tom Verlaine&#x27;s emphasis of the word &quot;felt&quot; in the Television song &quot;Venus&quot;.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Lawrence founded the band in 1979 with the release of the single &quot;Index&quot;, a self-published solo recording. A noisy effort unlike Felt&#x27;s subsequent records, it was later awarded single of the week by Dave McCullough in music newspaper &quot;Sounds&quot;.

With Lawrence initially on vocals and guitar, they formed properly in 1980 with the addition of schoolfriend Nick Gilbert on drums and local guitarist Maurice Deebank. Becoming co-writer with Lawrence, Deebank&#x27;s jangly, classical-influenced style of playing would provide the band&#x27;s signature sound in its early years.

The band performed as a trio before deciding that bass guitar was needed. Gilbert switched to bass and drummer Tony Race was added. He was replaced soon after by Gary Ainge who would remain the only constant member besides Lawrence throughout the rest of Felt&#x27;s existence, as well as the only member to play on all ten of their albums.

=== Signing ===
Felt signed to Cherry Red Records and their first single as a band, &quot;Something Sends Me to Sleep&quot;, was released in 1981. Their first album, &quot;Crumbling the Antiseptic Beauty&quot;, followed the next year. Exhausted by Lawrence&#x27;s domineering nature during the album&#x27;s sessions, Gilbert left and was replaced on bass by Mick Lloyd. Deebank would also take a sabbatical, recording a solo instrumental record &quot;Inner Thought Zone&quot;, before being coaxed by Lawrence to return to work on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Splendour of Fear&quot;. This lineup would then remain unchanged through their third album &quot;The Strange Idols Pattern and Other Short Stories&quot;, which took a more pop-orientated direction than the lengthy, ambient guitar workouts of its&#x27; predecessors. In 1982, the Felt song &quot;My Face Is on Fire&quot; appeared on the best-selling &quot;Pillows &amp; Prayers&quot; compilation.

In 1985, for the recording of their fourth album, keyboard player Martin Duffy was added and Marco Thomas became bassist. &quot;Ignite the Seven Cannons&quot; was produced by Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and featured Elizabeth Fraser on the single &quot;Primitive Painters&quot;. The song reached the top of the UK independent singles chart. Deebank departed for good soon after, prompting a shift in Felt&#x27;s sound with Duffy&#x27;s keyboards becoming more central. The lead guitar position would subsequently be filled by an ever-changing succession of players.

The band moved to Creation Records in 1986 and released &quot;Let the Snakes Crinkle Their Heads to Death&quot;, the first of two instrumental albums they would record. Their next album, &quot;Forever Breathes the Lonely Word&quot;, was a conventional collection of songs that gained the band praise and would become regarded by many as their best, though a full breakthrough continued to elude them.

&quot;Poem of the River&quot; followed in 1987, which took a much more low-key, intimate approach, at times recalling the sound of Felt&#x27;s first two albums. In 1988, Felt released &quot;The Pictorial Jackson Review&quot;, which saw the band become more experimental, with one side devoted to tight, melodic pop songs and the other consisting of two solo piano pieces from Duffy. The second release of that year was the polarising &quot;Train Above the City&quot;, which saw Lawrence take on more of a directing role in the studio, guiding Duffy and Ainge full through a collection of cool jazz-influenced instrumentals.

=== Break up and later ===
In 1989, Lawrence declared it had been his intention all along to release ten singles and ten albums in ten years and, having done so, announced the end of Felt. After releasing their last album, &quot;Me and a Monkey on the Moon&quot;, which embraced a lusher, more multi-layered sound alongside a more personal lyrical bent from Lawrence, and undertaking a short tour, the band split up. Lawrence went on to form Denim and later, Go Kart Mozart and Mozart Estate. Duffy joined Primal Scream. Ainge would later play with Vic Godard. Mick Lloyd died in 2016. Subsequent bass player Mick Bund died in 2017. Martin Duffy died in 2022.

In 2018, Cherry Red reissued all ten Felt albums on CD and vinyl, with new mixes of songs plus revised tracklistings and packaging.

==Legacy==
Lawrence has said that he believes the band could have been more successful. According to Lawrence, &quot;The reason Felt didn&#x27;t make it is because John Peel didn&#x27;t like us.&quot;

Felt have been cited as an influence by Stuart Murdoch of Belle and Sebastian, Tim Burgess of the Charlatans, Manic Street Preachers, Girls, and the Tyde.

<text>Alan George Bleasdale (born 23 March 1946) is an English screenwriter, best known for social realist drama serials based on the lives of ordinary people. A former teacher, he has written for radio, stage and screen, and has also written novels. Bleasdale&#x27;s plays typically represented a more realistic, contemporary depiction of life in Liverpool than was usually seen in the media.

==Early life==
Born in Liverpool, Bleasdale is an only child; his father worked in a food factory and his mother in a grocery shop. From 1951 to 1957, he went to the St. Aloysius Roman Catholic Infant and Junior Schools in Huyton-with-Roby outside Liverpool. From 1957 to 1964, he attended the Wade Deacon Grammar School in Widnes. In 1967, he obtained a teaching certificate from the Padgate College of Education in Warrington (which became Warrington Collegiate Institute, now part of the University of Chester).

For four years he worked as a teacher at St Columba&#x27;s Secondary Modern School in Huyton from 1967 to 1971, then King George V School (now the King George V &amp; Elaine Bernacchi School in Bikenibeu in South Tarawa) on the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (now called Kiribati) from 1971 to 1974, and lastly at Halewood Grange Comprehensive School (now known as Halewood College) in Halewood from 1974 to 1985. From 1985 to 1986, he worked as a playwright at the Liverpool Playhouse (becoming associate director) and the Contact Theatre in Manchester (a University of Manchester venue).

==Broadcasting==
Bleasdale&#x27;s first successes came as the writer of radio dramas for the BBC; several of these plays followed the character of Scully, a young man from Liverpool, and were broadcast on BBC Radio Merseyside. Between 1974 and 1979, the character of Scully continued on Radio City Liverpool through a series titled the &quot;Franny Scully Show&quot;. The character became so successful that Bleasdale wrote a stage play, two novels, and in 1978, a &quot;Play for Today&quot; titled &quot;Scully&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;.

That same year Bleasdale wrote a single play for the BBC1 anthology series &quot;Play for Today&quot; entitled &quot;The Black Stuff&quot; about a group of Liverpudlian tarmac layers. Filmed in 1978 and screened in 1980, the play focused on the issue of unemployment and despair felt by working class British citizens. Prior to screening, Bleasdale wrote to David Rose, head of BBC English Regions Drama, and Michael Wearing, script supervisor, and pitched the idea of a five-part series of plays that further explored the characters from &quot;The Black Stuff&quot;. The result was the BAFTA winning series &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;, which was transmitted on BBC2 in 1982. Bernard Hill starred in the role of Yosser Hughes, whose catch-phrase &quot;Gizza job&quot; became synonymous with the mass unemployment of the Thatcher years. The series established Bleasdale as one of Britain&#x27;s leading television writers and social commentators.

After &quot;The Black Stuff&quot; but before &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff,&quot; Bleasdale wrote &quot;The Muscle Market,&quot; which aired as a &quot;Play for Today&quot; on TV in 1981 and starred Pete Postlethwaite and Alison Steadman. Unlike &quot;Blackstuff,&quot; this play looked at the road construction industry from the boss&#x27; side rather than the workers.

Bleasdale wrote the screenplay for his only feature film &quot;No Surrender&quot; (1985), a black comedy which examines the animosity between the Protestants and Roman Catholics of Northern Ireland. Set in a seedy Liverpool night club, the film focuses on a group of elderly Protestant hardliners attending a New Year&#x27;s Eve party on the same evening as a group of Catholic retirees.

Bleasdale adapted William Allison and John Fairley&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot; into a four part miniseries in 1986. The series, starring Paul McGann, dramatises the WWI Etaples Mutiny of 1917. In 1987, Charlottetown Festival director Walter Learning presented the Canadian premiere of the Bleasdale musical &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot; at the Confederation Centre of the Arts, a national arts centre located on Prince Edward Island. The musical, which took a tough look at the life of Elvis Presley, attracted controversy at a festival for its coarse language and adult subject matter. Regardless of the objections, brought up in the provincial legislature, the play was a success for the festival. Bleasdale penned the political drama &quot;G.B.H.&quot; (Great British Holiday) for Channel 4 in 1991. Focussing on the political upheaval of the Labour Party in Liverpool, &quot;G.B.H.&quot; pits mild-mannered protagonist Jim Nelson against the northern City Council leader Michael Murray.

In 1994, Bleasdale collaborated with Keith Thompson and David Jones on an anthology of four filmed dramas written by authors who had no prior screenwriting credits. The scripts were chosen from a pool of 2,000 applicants, with Bleasdale acting as producer/mentor to each of the four writers chosen and then working on the projects from start to finish. The films, Andrew Cullen&#x27;s &quot;Self Catering&quot;, Raymond Murtagh&#x27;s &quot;Requiem Apache&quot;, Jim Morris&#x27; &quot;Blood On the Dole&quot;, and Christopher Hood&#x27;s &quot;Pleasure&quot;, were screened over four consecutive weeks in October of that year.

Bleasdale continued his work for Channel 4 with 1995&#x27;s serial &quot;Jake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, the story of a modern-day dysfunctional family (Robert Lindsay as the father and Julie Walters as the mother) struggling to cope with a &quot;difficult&quot; child (Barclay Wright).

In 1999, Bleasdale adapted Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; into a four part miniseries for ITV. The adaptation was well received, but attracted some controversy as Bleasdale expanded the narrative by adding a backstory for the character of Oliver.

After an eleven-year absence from television, Bleasdale returned in January 2011 on BBC Two with a two-part TV film, &quot;The Sinking of the Laconia&quot;. He had been working on the screenplay since 2004; it depicted the events surrounding the World War II ocean liner RMS &quot;Laconia&quot; and the Laconia incident.

==Personal life==
Bleasdale married Julie Moses on 28 December 1970. They have two sons and one daughter.

Bleasdale&#x27;s house is the main location in Nickelodeon&#x27;s youth series called &quot;House of Anubis&quot;, which premiered in January 2011.

<text>Haymarket Media Group is a privately held media company headquartered in London. It has publications in the consumer, business and customer sectors, both print and online. It operates exhibitions allied to its own publications, and previously on behalf of organisations such as the BBC. The company expanded outside the UK in 1999.

==History==
Haymarket began in 1956, under the name Cornmarket Press. Clive Labovitch and Michael Heseltine – later a Cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher and Deputy Prime Minister under John Major – who had met at university, started out with the 1957 &quot;Directory of Opportunities for Graduates&quot;, and in 1959 relaunched &quot;Man About Town&quot;, which was to become an influential (if unprofitable) men&#x27;s consumer magazine. 

The company failed in its relaunch of the British news weekly &quot;Topic&quot;, the title closing at the end of 1962, within three months of the takeover. The partners split in 1965, with Heseltine renaming his half of the business Haymarket Press to publish &quot;Management Today&quot;. In 1967 British Printing Corporation merged its titles into the company too. New titles included weekly &quot;Autosport&quot;, monthly &quot;Lithoprinter&quot; (later known as &quot;PrintWeek&quot;) and &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; (GC). 

The company was renamed Haymarket Publishing; owing to its growing presence in online media and live events, it was rebranded as Haymarket Media Group in 2007. Haymarket has laboured under heavy borrowings since Michael Heseltine returned from politics to take the helm and to buy back large minority shareholdings from Lindsay Masters and Simon Tindall, who had managed the business in his absence. These borrowings were reduced to some extent by the sale of properties. The company is now managed by Heseltine&#x27;s son Rupert.

<text>Carnsore Point ( or &quot;Ceann an Chairn&quot;) is a headland in the southeast corner of County Wexford, Ireland. It marks the southernmost point of the Irish Sea, on the western side of St George&#x27;s Channel.

==History==
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a point called Ιερον (&quot;Hieron&quot;, &quot;sacred promontory&quot;) which probably referred to Carnsore Point.

Grey Wexford granite from Carnsore Point, as well as Killiney Hill, Dublin was used for construction of parts of the Thames Embankment in London during the 1800s.

==Energy==
===Cancelled nuclear project===
Carnsore was proposed to be the location of a Nuclear Energy Board power plant. If built as proposed in the 1970s, the plant would have produced electricity for the Electricity Supply Board. First proposed in 1968, the then Government of Ireland gave renewed effort to the plans after the 1973 energy crisis. The plan envisaged one, and eventually four, nuclear power stations. However, the plan was dropped in the late 1970s after opposition by environmental groups, including the Wexford group the Nuclear Safety Association. The campaign against the proposed plant also gained some international support, including from Petra Kelly, who gave a speech at Carnsore. One activist against the plant who later became notable was Adi Roche, who went on to found Chernobyl Children International.

Anti-nuclear groups organised a series of rallies and concerts at Carnsore Point from August 1978 to August 1981. Titled &quot;Get to the Point&quot; and &quot;Back to the Point&quot; respectively, and featuring Christy Moore as lead act, the concerts were served to bring to public notice the question of nuclear power in Ireland. The British and Irish Communist Organisation, who believed nuclear power was necessary to achieve socialism in Ireland, picketed the first concert.

===Wind farm===
As of 2002, the ESB Group proposed to build a wind farm in the area. The 12 megawatt wind farm began operations in 2003.

<text>James Stanley McGovern (born September 1949) is an English screenwriter and producer. He is best known for creating the drama series &quot;Cracker&quot; (1993–1995), for which he received two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. He also received recognition for creating drama series such as &quot;Hillsborough&quot;, &quot;The Lakes&quot;, &quot;The Street&quot;, and &quot;Accused&quot;, among others. On 8 December 2021, McGovern was conferred the Freedom of Liverpool in recognition of his life&#x27;s work.

==Early life==
McGovern was born in Liverpool in September 1949, the son of working-class parents Jane (née Warner) and William McGovern. He was the fifth of nine children. He has a stammer, for which he received no therapy and which affects him still. Brought up a Catholic, he attended St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College which moved to the Woolton suburb of Liverpool in 1961.

==Career==
===Television===
In 1982, McGovern started his TV career working on Channel 4&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot;. He tackled many social issues in the course of the series, especially unemployment – which was at a post-war high at the time. In 1993, he created the drama serial &quot;Cracker&quot;, about the work of a fictional criminal psychologist played by Robbie Coltrane. Made by Granada Television and screened on ITV, the series was a critical and popular success, lasting until 1995. &quot;Cracker&quot; also aired in the United States, on the Arts and Entertainment cable network. McGovern&#x27;s writing earned him two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. In 1997 he created &quot;The Lakes&quot;, a drama that shared &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; realist setting and reused themes from &quot;Cracker,&quot; such as gambling addiction. In 2006, he created the BBC One drama, &quot;The Street&quot;; its third and final series aired in 2009.

McGovern also wrote the script for the television docudrama &quot;Hillsborough&quot; (1996), based on the events of the stadium disaster in 1989, which claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans at an FA Cup semi-final. Among the cast of this drama was Christopher Eccleston, who also featured in &quot;Cracker&quot;, along with former &quot;Brookside&quot; actor Ricky Tomlinson. Eccleston later said it was the most important work he&#x27;d ever done. Newspapers cited &quot;Hillsborough&quot; as a factor in a new inquiry set up in 1997.

In 2009, McGovern was the executive producer on the BBC One miniseries &quot;Moving On&quot;. His series &quot;Accused&quot; aired from 2010 to 2012 on BBC One. It followed a similar format to &quot;The Street&quot; but with a crime component. The series&#x27; writers included McGovern, Danny Brocklehurst, Alice Nutter and Shaun Duggan. It was produced by Sita Williams.

In 2012, McGovern and local Indigenous Australian writers from Sydney developed the Australian television drama series &quot;Redfern Now&quot;, set among the Indigenous Australians of the Sydney suburb of Redfern. The six-part series follows a similar format to &quot;Accused&quot;, telling the stories of six inner-city households in one street whose lives are changed by a seemingly insignificant incident. The series debuted on 1 November 2012, was produced by Blackfella Films and has been commissioned for a second series.

In June 2021, McGovern&#x27;s series &quot;Time&quot;, starring Sean Bean and Stephen Graham, aired on BBC One. The series was directed by Lewis Arnold. It won the BAFTA for best miniseries in 2022.

===Film===
McGovern wrote the screenplay for the 1994 drama, &quot;Priest&quot;.

===Stage===
McGovern wrote the book for the musical stage show &quot;King Cotton&quot;, which explores links between the Atlantic slave trade and industrialisation in North West England, as part of the Liverpool European Capital of Culture 2008. &quot;King Cotton&quot; premiered at the Lowry in September 2007 before moving to the Liverpool Empire.

===Views on writing===
McGovern has described cinema scriptwriters as being treated poorly and required to produce an abundance of drafts by successive producers. McGovern has openly criticised dramas such as &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot; lamenting the lack of quality, believable storytelling in the early 2000s. He believes that television directors are underrated. He says: &quot;I have worked twice with David Blair&quot; on &quot;The Lakes&quot; and &quot;The Street&quot;, &quot;and I can tell you that he is the best there is. He can make a good project great... Why David hasn’t won the acclaim he deserves is a mystery to me&quot;.

<text>Gordon William Prange (; July 16, 1910 – May 15, 1980) was the author of several World War II historical manuscripts which were published by his co-workers after his death in 1980. Prange was a professor of history at the University of Maryland from 1937 to 1980 with a break of nine years (1942–1951) of military service in the United States Navy during World War II, and in the postwar military occupation of Japan, when he was the Chief Historian on General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff. It was during this time that Prange collected material from and interviewed many Japanese military officers, enlisted men, and civilians, with the information later being used in the writing of his books. Several became &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers, including &quot;At Dawn We Slept, The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor&quot; and &quot;Miracle at Midway&quot;.

Prange&#x27;s 1963 &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, published in the November and December issues of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, and later expanded into &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot;, portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor, and is credited as the basis for the screenplay of the film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, which was produced in 1970, while Prange took a leave of absence from the University of Maryland to serve as the technical consultant during its filming. His extensive research into the attack on Pearl Harbor was the subject of a Public Broadcasting Service television program in 2000, &quot;Prange and Pearl Harbor: A Magnificent Obsession&quot;, and was acclaimed &quot;a definitive book on the event&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Prange was a popular lecturer at the University of Maryland. The &quot;Terrapin&quot;, the university&#x27;s yearbook, said of his World War I and World War II history classes: &quot;Students flock to his class and sit enraptured as he animates the pages of twentieth century European history through his goosesteps, &#x27;Sieg Heils&#x27;, &#x27;Achtungs&#x27;, machine gun retorts and frantic gestures&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Gordon William Prange was born on July 16, 1910, in Pomeroy, Iowa. His parents were Al, a blacksmith and his wife Johanna. He had one older brother Russell. He attended Pomeroy High School, where he excelled in baseball and track athletics. He was also known as the class clown. He graduated from Pomeroy in 1928 and enrolled at the University of Iowa intending to become a coach, but switched to history. He obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree, his master&#x27;s degree in 1934, and doctorate in 1937. He studied at the University of Berlin in 1935 to 1936, during which he said: &quot;I saw Hitler operate firsthand and heard him speak a number of times.&quot;

=== Family ===
In 1937 he married Anne Root, a professor&#x27;s daughter from Iowa City. They had two daughters and a son. They moved to Maryland, where Prange took employment as a history instructor at the University of Maryland.

=== Death ===
Prange died on May 15, 1980, in Baltimore, Maryland, from cancer, aged 69. &#x27;Prange Park&#x27; in Pomeroy is named after him.

<text>The Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC) was a British Research Council responsible for funding and managing scientific and technological developments in farming and horticulture.

==History==
The AFRC was formed in 1983 from its predecessor, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC). It was replaced by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) as a result of government reorganisation in 1994. At that time, Sir William Henderson who was secretary to the AFRC claimed that &quot;agriculture was a success story&quot; hence the AFRC could be closed and a new vision for research was envisaged in the creation of the BBSRC. With this shift in emphasis, there also followed the closure of several educational and research organisations as for example the internationally renowned Wye College.

<text>Bitter is an English style of pale ale that varies in colour from gold to dark amber, and in strength typically from 3% to 5.5% alcohol by volume.

==History==
The term &quot;bitter&quot; has been used in England to describe pale ale since the early 19th century. Although brewers used the term &quot;pale ale&quot;, before the introduction of pump clips, customers in pubs would ask for &quot;bitter&quot; to differentiate it from mild ale; by the end of the 19th century, brewers had begun to use the term as well.

During the 20th century, bitter became the most popular type of draught beer sold in British pubs and has been described as &quot;the national drink of England&quot;. In Scotland, bitter is known as either &quot;light&quot; or &quot;heavy&quot; depending on the strength, colour and body.

Bitter is traditionally cask conditioned and either dispensed by gravity through a tap in the cask or by a beer engine at &quot;cellar temperature&quot; of 11°C-14°C (50°F-55°F). The popularity of craft brewing in North America has led to British-style bitter being brewed there since the 1980s.

==Style==
Bitter belongs to the pale ale beer style and can have a great variety of strength, flavour and appearance, from dark amber to a golden summer ale. It can be under 3% abv and as high as 7% with premium or strong bitters. The colour may be controlled by the addition of caramel colouring. It is similar to the India pale ale style of beer, though bitters are less hoppy. A survey by SIBA found that in 2020 the average bitter beer strength in the UK was 4.2%.

==Sub-types of bitter==
;: In England the bottled counterpart of basic bitter; in Scotland, &quot;Light&quot; is the lowest gravity draught beer (normally dark in colour).
;: Strength up to 4.1% abv. This is the most common strength of bitter sold in British pubs. It accounted for 16.9% of pub sales in 2003.
;: Strength between 4.2% and 4.7% abv. In the United Kingdom bitter above 4.2% abv accounted for just 2.9% of pub sales in 2003. The disappearance of weaker bitters from some brewers&#x27; rosters means &quot;best&quot; bitter is actually the weakest in the range.
;: Strength of 4.8% abv and over.
;: Golden or summer ale has an appearance and profile similar to that of a pale lager. Golden ale is typically brewed without the use of crystal malts, or at least in far lower quantity to a traditional bitter. In 2020, 83.5% of SIBA member breweries were producing &#x27;pale golden bitter&#x27;.

<text>David Peter Renwick (; born 4 September 1951) is an English author, television writer, actor, director and executive producer. He created the sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; and the mystery series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;. He was awarded the Writers Guild Ronnie Barker Award at the 2008 British Comedy Awards.

==Early life==
The son and only child of James George Renwick and Winifred May Smith, who were married in 1948, David Renwick was born and brought up in Luton, Bedfordshire, England. He was educated through to sixth form level at Luton Grammar School, a former state grammar school. The school became known as Luton Sixth Form College while he was still a pupil. He studied journalism at Harlow Technical College.

==Career==
===1970s===
Before becoming a comedy writer Renwick worked as a journalist, reporter and sub-editor on his home town newspaper, the &quot;Luton News&quot;.

On beginning his comedy writing career in the mid-1970s he initially submitted material for BBC radio comedies including &quot;Week Ending&quot; and &quot;The News Huddlines&quot;. He also contributed to other radio series such as &quot;Oh, Get On With It!&quot; starring Kenneth Williams and with David McKellar co-wrote &quot;Harry Worth in Things Could Be Worse&quot; featuring Harry Worth.

Teaming up with writing partner Andrew Marshall, they wrote the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot; and provided sketches for BBC television shows such as &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; and &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; during the late 1970s and early &#x27;80s. One of the most celebrated sketches he wrote for &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; was a parody of the BBC quiz programme &quot;Mastermind&quot;, where a &quot;Charlie Smithers&quot; chose to answer questions on the specialist subject &quot;Answering the question before last&quot;, adapted from his &quot;Answering one question behind all the time&quot; sketch from &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot;. Their short-lived LWT series for ITV, &quot;End of Part One&quot;, was an attempt to transfer &quot;Burkiss&quot;-style humour to television.

Renwick also wrote for Les Dawson, Bernie Winters as well as Little and Large at the end of the 1970s.

===1980s===
In 1982 Renwick and Marshall penned the comedy drama serial &quot;Whoops Apocalypse&quot; for LWT, based on the insanity of international politics in the age of nuclear weapons, and four years later they adapted the screenplay (changing most of the characters and situations completely) into a feature film version. In 1983 they wrote &quot;The Steam Video Company&quot; for Thames Television, a short comedy series consisting of absurd parodies of famous novels. This was followed in 1986 by &quot;Hot Metal&quot; for LWT, a six-part satire of the tabloid newspaper industry starring Robert Hardy, Geoffrey Palmer and John Gordon Sinclair. The show was a critical success and returned for a further six episodes in 1988 with a revised cast of Robert Hardy, Richard Wilson and Caroline Milmoe.

Renwick also wrote for the sketch show &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Stuff&quot; and Spike Milligan&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Lot of It About&quot;.

He began writing solo at the end of the 1980s when he created the sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, starring Richard Wilson, which was highly successful.

===1990s===
&quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; went on to be a popular hit for an entire decade. It also ran for four seasons as an American remake titled &quot;Cosby&quot;, starring Bill Cosby, although this is generally regarded as a very loose adaptation of the original. The series won a BAFTA award for best comedy programme in 1992, with Renwick receiving The Writers&#x27; Guild Award for Best Comedy Writer in that same year.

Renwick switched to writing drama in 1990 and 1991 to indulge his love of detective stories and dramatise four episodes (one being co-written) for the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (ITV, 1989–2002), featuring David Suchet as the Belgian sleuth. In 1992, Renwick and co-writer Michael Baker received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the &quot;Poirot&quot; episode &quot;The Lost Mine&quot;, which aired in the US as part of the PBS anthology series &quot;Mystery!&quot;

In 1993, he wrote, back with Marshall again, the four-part comedy miniseries &quot;If You See God, Tell Him&quot; which starred Imelda Staunton, Adrian Edmondson and Richard Briers, with a brief appearance from Angus Deayton. Several other minor roles also went to actors with whom Renwick worked with on &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;.

In 1997, Renwick devised the comedy-drama and mystery series, &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, based around the crime-solving abilities of the eponymous designer of magic tricks, played by comedian Alan Davies. This series also became successful.

In 1999 Renwick received BAFTA&#x27;s Dennis Potter Award, established to recognise outstanding writing for television.

===2000s===
Another comedy-drama Renwick has penned, &quot;Love Soup&quot;, starring Tamsin Greig and Michael Landes, premiered on BBC One on 27 September 2005. Renwick, and his former writing partner Marshall, had cameo roles in an episode of the series as members of a television sitcom scriptwriting team.

On 3 December 2007 BBC Four broadcast &quot;David Renwick Night&quot;, a themed evening of programmes written by or about the author.

In 2008, Renwick directed for the first time as he brought back the series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; after a five year hiatus. The episode, &quot;The Grinning Man&quot;, was almost two hours long and was broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Day 2009.

He was awarded the Writers Guild Ronnie Barker Award at the British Comedy Awards 2008.

===2010s===
In 2010 Renwick directed a further episode of his series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, with the 94-minute long instalment &quot;The Judas Tree&quot; being broadcast on Easter Sunday.

In 2012, he developed a series called &quot;Ergo&quot; for ITV, which was to star Robert Webb as a man living with his stepmother following the death of his father. &quot;It was a domestic comedy, my attempt to do something like &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; in the country really,&quot; said Renwick. However, Renwick and ITV encountered creative differences and the project was not produced.

Renwick wrote a further five episodes of &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, the last of which to date was broadcast in December 2016. As of 2020, thirty-two episodes have been produced across five short-run series and six specials. The slow rate of production is partly due to Renwick&#x27;s writing of the episodes, which he describes as being a painstaking process in which the intricacies of the plots take several months to work out. It is not known whether the series will return.

In 2016 Renwick wrote the four-part radio miniseries &quot;Desolation Jests&quot;. The show, starring David Jason, John Bird, Jan Ravens and Rory Bremner, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 from 13 December 2016 until 3 January 2017. The miniseries was repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2022.

==Personal life==
In 1994 Renwick married Eleanor Hogarth. The couple reside between Pavenham and Stevington in northern Bedfordshire.

==Books==
Renwick is also an author, having written the novels &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; (1992) and &quot;One Foot in the Grave and Counting&quot; (2021) – both featuring original plots, as well as ones reworked from the television series.

<text>Coffee milk is a drink made by mixing 1 part coffee and 10 parts milk, in a manner similar to chocolate milk. Since 1993, it has been the official state drink of the U.S. state of Rhode Island.

==History==
While the precise origin of coffee milk is unclear, several sources trace it back to the 19th century Italian immigrant population in Providence, Rhode Island. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, approximately 55,000 Italian immigrants traveled to Providence, introducing their traditions and customs to Rhode Island; this included drinking sweetened coffee with milk, which is believed to have led to the creation of coffee milk.

Coffee milk originated in American diners and soda fountains in the early 20th century. The first coffee syrup is thought to have been created by a soda fountain operator who sweetened leftover coffee grounds with milk and sugar to create a syrup, then mixed it into glasses of milk. In the 1930s, coffee milk was regularly served at pharmacy lunch counters, targeted toward children and youth as an alternative to the hot coffee served to their parents.

Due to the popularity of the product, coffee syrup was eventually bottled and sold by merchants. The first merchant to bottle and sell coffee syrup was D. Abelsen &amp; Son who created an Arabian Brand Coffee Syrup in Grant Mills, Cumberland, RI. The product was first documented in the 1926 Ice Cream Trade Journal published by Thomas D. Cutler. The syrup was advertised as “Our New Creation Arabian Brand Coffee Syrup for Ice Cream Topping, Milk Shakes, Iced Coffee, Etc.” D. Abelsen &amp; Son set up production at their factory at 556 North Main Street in Providence, RI.

To honor the heritage of this local beverage which originated in RI&#x27;s Blackstone Valley, Blackstone Valley Tourism Council, markets their own version of coffee syrup (in collaboration with Dave&#x27;s Coffee).

Silmo Packing Company of New Bedford, Massachusetts began producing coffee syrup in 1932. And in 1938, Warwick, Rhode Island’s Eclipse Foods produced its own version. Lincoln, Rhode Island&#x27;s Autocrat Coffee began producing coffee syrup in the 1930s. Coffee Time was produced by a New Hampshire based producer around the same time. In 1963, Eclipse Foods and Coffee Time were purchased by Globe Extracts of Hauppage, New York. In the 1990s, Autocrat acquired Eclipse and Coffee Time, produced all three brands, and came to dominate the coffee syrup market.

Autocrat is claimed to be the most popular brand of coffee syrup in Rhode Island. Newer brands such as Dave&#x27;s Coffee and Morning Glory offer coffee syrups with desired customer qualities, such as no high-fructose corn syrup or artificial colors.

In 1993, the Rhode Island General Assembly opted to change Rhode Island&#x27;s state drink, with the two potential choices being coffee milk and Del&#x27;s Lemonade. Coffee milk ultimately triumphed, and was officially named the state drink on July 29, 1993.

== Coffee syrup ==

Coffee syrup is a sweetened coffee concentrate and is a key ingredient in coffee milk.

Coffee syrup is produced by straining hot water and sugar through coffee grounds. It can also be prepared by preparing a large amount of hot coffee and then adding sugar to it afterward. A cold-process method for coffee syrup involves soaking pulverized coffee beans for some time and then adding sugar.

Coffee syrup is often brewed at home, in a saucepan using coffee and sugar.

==Related foods==
A coffee cabinet is an ice cream-based milkshake-style beverage found almost exclusively in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, consisting of coffee ice cream, coffee syrup, and milk.

In December 2013, the Narragansett Brewing Company partnered with Autocrat Coffee to market a limited edition &quot;coffee milk stout&quot;.

In summer 2015, Warwick Ice Cream collaborated with Autocrat to produce coffee milk ice cream.

<text>Edward Riley Ives (September 13, 1839 – 1918) was an American toymaker from Connecticut. He married Jennie Blakeslee in 1866, and with the help of his father-in-law and brother-in-law, he founded the Ives Manufacturing Company two years later in 1868 in Plymouth, Connecticut. It became one of the largest toy companies in the United States during the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. Late in his career, he turned the company over to his son, Harry Ives.

Edward Ives was a distant cousin of U.S. classical music composer Charles Edward Ives. Ives and his son were the subject of a biography titled &quot;Messrs. Ives of Bridgeport,&quot; written by Louis Hertz and published in 1950.

<doc id="838061" wikidata="Q1335086" url="?curid=838061" title="Broaching (metalworking)">
<text>Broaching is a machining process that uses a toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;rotary&quot;. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to produce the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to &quot;broach&quot;. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.

Broaching is used when precision machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.

Broaches are shaped similar to a saw, except the height of the teeth increases over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the &quot;step&quot; or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed and the size of the chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.

==History==
The concept of broaching can be traced back to the early 1850s, with the first applications used for cutting keyways in pulleys and gears. After World War I, broaching was used to rifle gun barrels. In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form grinding and broaching machines.

==Process==
The process depends on the type of broaching being performed. Surface broaching is very simple as either the workpiece is moved against a stationary surface broach, or the workpiece is held stationary while the broach is moved against it.

Internal broaching is more involved. The process begins by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a &quot;workholder&quot;, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine &quot;elevator&quot;, which is the part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine&#x27;s &quot;puller&quot;, essentially a hook, grabs the &quot;pilot&quot; of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the follower and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.

Cutting fluids are used for three reasons:
# to cool the workpiece and broach
# to lubricate cutting surfaces
# to flush the chips from the teeth. 
Fortified petroleum cutting fluids are the most common. However, heavy-duty water-soluble cutting fluids are being used because of their superior cooling, cleanliness, and non-flammability.

==Usage==
Broaching was originally developed for machining internal keyways. However, it was soon discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.

Broaching speeds vary from 20 to 120 surface feet per minute (SFPM). This results in a complete cycle time of 5 to 30 seconds. Most of the time is consumed by the return stroke, broach handling, and workpiece loading and unloading.

The only limitations on broaching are that there are no obstructions over the length of the surface to be machined, the geometry to be cut does not have curves in multiple planes, and that the workpiece is strong enough to withstand the forces involved. Specifically for internal broaching a hole must first exist in the workpiece so the broach can enter. Also, there are limits on the size of internal cuts. Common internal holes can range from in diameter but it is possible to achieve a range of . Surface broaches&#x27; range is usually , although the feasible range is .

Tolerances are usually ±0.002 in (±0.05 mm), but in precise applications a tolerance of ±0.0005 in (±0.01 mm) can be held. Surface finishes are usually between 16 and 63 microinches (μin), but can range from 8 to 125 μin. There may be small burrs on the exit side of the cut.

Broaching works best on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, it still has a good machinability rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating is closely related to the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.

==Types==
Broaches can be categorized by many means:
*Use: internal, or surface
*Purpose: single, or combination
*Motion: push, pull, or stationary
*Construction: solid, built-up, hollow or shell
*Function: roughing, sizing, or burnishing

If the broach is large enough the costs can be reduced by using a &quot;built-up&quot; or &quot;modular&quot; construction. This involves producing the broach in pieces and assembling it. If any portion wears out only that section has to be replaced, instead of the entire broach.

Most broaches are made from high speed steel (HSS) or an alloy steel; titanium nitride (TiN) coatings are common on HSS to prolong life. Except when broaching cast iron, tungsten carbide is rarely used as a tooth material because the cutting edge will crack on the first pass.

===Surface broaches===
The &quot;slab broach&quot; is the simplest surface broach. It is a general purpose tool for cutting flat surfaces.

&quot;Slot broaches&quot; (G &amp; H) are for cutting slots of various dimensions at high production rates. Slot broaching is much quicker than milling when more than one slot needs to be machined, because multiple broaches can be run through the part at the same time on the same broaching machine.

&quot;Contour broaches&quot; are designed to cut concave, convex, cam, contoured, and irregular shaped surfaces.

&quot;Pot broaches&quot; are cut the inverse of an internal broach; they cut the outside diameter of a cylindrical workpiece. They are named after the pot looking fixture in which the broaches are mounted; the fixture is often referred to as a &quot;pot&quot;. The pot is designed to hold multiple broaching tools concentrically over its entire length. The broach is held stationary while the workpiece is pushed or pulled through it. This has replaced hobbing for some involute gears and cutting external splines and slots.

&quot;Straddle broaches&quot; use two slab broaches to cut parallel surfaces on opposite sides of a workpiece in one pass. This type of broaching holds closer tolerances than if the two cuts were done independently. It is named after the fact that the broaches &quot;straddle&quot; the workpiece on multiple sides.

===Internal broaches===
&quot;Solid&quot; broaches are the most common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly &quot;shell&quot; broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be replaced often because the pilots are on the mandrel and do not have to be reproduced with each replacement.

&quot;Modular&quot; broaches are commonly used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches in that they are a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.

A common type of internal broach is the &quot;keyway&quot; broach (C &amp; D). It uses a special fixture called a &quot;horn&quot; to support the broach and properly locate the part with relation to the broach.

A &quot;concentricity broach&quot; is a special type of spline cutting broach which cuts both the minor diameter and the spline form to ensure precise concentricity.

The &quot;cut-and-recut broach&quot; is used to cut thin-walled workpieces. Thin-walled workpieces have a tendency to expand during cutting and then shrink afterward. This broach overcomes that problem by first broaching with the standard roughing teeth, followed by a &quot;breathing&quot; section, which serves as a pilot as the workpiece shrinks. The teeth after the &quot;breathing&quot; section then include roughing, semi-finishing, and finishing teeth.

===Design===
For defining the geometry of a broach an internal type is shown below. Note that the geometries of other broaches are similar.


where:
*&quot;P&quot; = pitch
*&quot;RPT&quot; = rise per tooth
*&quot;n&quot;r = number of roughing teeth
*&quot;n&quot;s = number of semi-finishing teeth
*&quot;n&quot;f = number of finishing teeth
*&quot;t&quot;r = RPT for the roughing teeth
*&quot;t&quot;s = RPT for the semi-finishing teeth
*&quot;t&quot;f = RPT for the finishing teeth
*&quot;L&quot;s = Shank length
*&quot;L&quot;RP = Rear pilot length
*&quot;D&quot;1 = Diameter of the tooth tip
*&quot;D&quot;2 = Diameter of the tooth root
*&quot;D&quot; = Depth of a tooth (0.4P)
*&quot;L&quot; = Land (behind the cutting edge) (0.25P)
*&quot;R&quot; = Radius of the gullet (0.25P)
*&quot;α&quot; = Hook angle or rake angle
*&quot;γ&quot; = Back-off angle or clearance angle
*&quot;L&quot;w = Length of the workpiece (not shown)

The most important characteristic of a broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which is how much material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (&quot;t&quot;r), semi-finishing section (&quot;t&quot;s), and finishing section (&quot;t&quot;f). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The semi-finishing teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section&#x27;s RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For free-machining steels the RPT ranges from . For surface broaching the RPT is usually between and for diameter broaching is usually between . The exact value depends on many factors. If the cut is too big it will impart too much stress into the teeth and the workpiece; if the cut is too small the teeth rub instead of cutting. One way to increase the RPT while keeping the stresses down is with chip breakers. They are notches in the teeth designed to break the chip and decrease the overall amount of material being removed by any given tooth (see the drawing above). For broaching to be effective, the workpiece should have more material than the final dimension of the cut.

The &quot;hook&quot; (&quot;α&quot;) angle is a parameter of the material being cut. For steel, it is between 15 and 20° and for cast iron it is between 6 and 8°. The &quot;back-off&quot; (&quot;γ&quot;) provides clearance for the teeth so that they don&#x27;t rub on the workpiece; it is usually between 1 and 3°.

When radially broaching workpieces that require a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a &quot;rotor-cut&quot; or &quot;jump-cut&quot; design can be used; these broaches are also known as &quot;free egress&quot; or &quot;nibbling&quot; broaches. In this design the RPT is designated to two or three rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, and then the next tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.

There are two different options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first is similar to the rotor-cut design, which is known as a &quot;double-cut&quot; design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a &quot;progressive&quot; broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.

For some circular broaches, &quot;burnishing teeth&quot; are provided instead of finishing teeth. They are not really teeth, as they are just rounded discs that are oversized. This results in burnishing the hole to the proper size. This is primarily used on non-ferrous and cast iron workpieces.

The pitch defines the tooth construction, strength, and number of teeth in contact with the workpiece. The pitch is usually calculated from workpiece length, so that the broach can be designed to have at least two teeth in contact with the workpiece at any time; the pitch remains constant for all teeth of the broach. One way to calculate the pitch is:

:formula_1

==Broaching machines==
Broaching machines are relatively simple as they only have to move the broach in a linear motion at a predetermined speed and provide a means for handling the broach automatically. Most machines are hydraulic, but a few specialty machines are mechanically driven. The machines are distinguished by whether their motion is horizontal or vertical. The choice of machine is primarily dictated by the stroke required. Vertical broaching machines rarely have a stroke longer than .

Vertical broaching machines can be designed for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push broaching machines are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine is the most common type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.

Horizontal broaching machines are designed for pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines are similar to the surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.

Horizontal machines used to be much more common than vertical machines; however, today they represent just 10% of all broaching machines purchased. Vertical machines are more popular because they take up less space.

Broaching is often impossible without the specific broaching or keyway machines unless you have a system that can be used in conjunction with a modern machining centre or driven tooling lathe; these extra bits of equipment open up the possibility of producing keyways, splines and Torx through one-hit machining.

== Rotary broaching ==

A somewhat different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer profile of a broach is called a &quot;rotary broach&quot; or &quot;wobble broach&quot;. One of the biggest advantages to this type of broaching is that it does not require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.

Rotary broaching requires two tooling components: a tool holder and a broach. The leading (cutting) edge of the broach has a contour matching the desired final shape. The broach is mounted in a special tool holder that allows it to freely rotate. The tool holder is special because it holds the tool so that its axis of rotation is inclined slightly to the axis of rotation of the work. A typical value for this misalignment is 1°. This angle is what produces a rotating edge for the broach to cut the workpiece. Either the workpiece or the tool holder is rotated. If the tool holder is rotated, the misalignment causes the broach to appear as though it is &quot;wobbling&quot;, which is the origin of the term &quot;wobble broach&quot;.

For internal broaching the sides of the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.

Ideally the tool advances at the same rate that it cuts. The ideal rate of cut is defined as:

:Rate of cut [inches per rotation (IPR)] = (diameter of tool [inches]) × sin(Angle of misalignment [degrees])

If it advances much faster, then the tool becomes choked; conversely, if it advances much slower, then an interrupted or zig-zag cut occurs. In practice the rate of cut is slightly less than the ideal rate so that the load is released on the non-cutting edge of the tool.

There is some spiraling of the tool as it cuts, so the form at the bottom of the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body of the tool and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.

In general, a rotary broach will not cut as accurately as a push or pull broach. However, the ability to use this type of cutting tool on common machine tools is highly advantageous. In addition, push or pull broaches cannot be used in a blind hole, while a rotary broach can, as long as there is sufficient space for chips at the bottom of the hole.

<doc id="838070" wikidata="Q2172326" url="?curid=838070" title="Rothley">
<text>Rothley ( ) is a village and civil parish within the Borough of Charnwood in Leicestershire, England. Situated around west of the River Soar and north of Leicester, it had a population of 3,612 inhabitants . The population measured at the 2011 census was 3,897.

Rothley centres on two greens, Cross Green and the Town Green, both of which are accessed by a road that leads from the crossroads. The crossroads lies on the old route of the A6 road, which now bypasses the village.

Rothley is one of Leicestershire&#x27;s most affluent areas based on number of houses worth more than £1 million – especially in some streets such as The Ridgeway, identified in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; as the most expensive place to live in the East Midlands.

Most children of primary schooling age attend Rothley (Church of England) Primary School. The main shopping street in the village is Woodgate. Rothley has four churches, Rothley Baptist Church, the Methodist Church, Sacred Heart RC, and the main parish church St Mary &amp; St John&#x27;s Church of England.

Rothley has close links with its neighbouring village, Mountsorrel, which is to the north.

==History==

Rothley has been inhabited since Saxon times, as evidenced by the ancient Saxon cross in the church graveyard in the village. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book where it is listed as &quot;Rodolei&quot; amongst the lands belonging to the king, William I. The land includes of meadow, a mill and considerable woodlands. This manor also controlled surrounding pieces of land in a large number of villages including Asfordby, Seagrave and Sileby. Its name may have come from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Roþlēah = &quot;meadow in a clearing&quot;.

In the Middle Ages, Rothley was home to a manor of the Knights Templar, known as Rothley Temple, but now the Rothley Court Hotel, which passed to the Babington family after the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. The Babington family held the manor for almost 300 years until the death in 1837 of Thomas Babington. Married to Jean Macaulay, the daughter of a Scottish Presbyterian minister, Thomas Babington was MP for Leicester from 1800–1818, and a leading Anglican evangelical. Educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge alongside William Wilberforce, the two worked closely together on social improvement and famously on the bills to abolish the slave trade.

Wilberforce and Babington spent much time at the Rothley retreat working on the text of the bills, and on the analysis of the Select Committee&#x27;s enquiries into the trade. Babington was instrumental in rescuing his wife&#x27;s young brother, Zachary Macaulay, from the mental trauma of working as an overseer on a Jamaican slave plantation, when Zachary came to recuperate at Rothley Temple. Zachary was restored, and with a new Christian faith, went on to a lifetime devoted to the anti-slavery cause, and to have a posthumous bust in his honour placed in Westminster Abbey. Zachary returned often to Rothley, and on one long visit in 1800 his wife Selina (née Mills) gave birth to poet, historian and Whig politician Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay.

In 1899, Rothley railway station was opened on the Great Central Railway, which is now part of the Great Central Railway. The station has been used to film period drama such as the 1988 film &quot;Buster&quot; and the 2004 &quot;Miss Marple&quot; TV adaptation of &quot;4.50 from Paddington&quot; (where the station stood in for Paddington).

The Bishop&#x27;s House in Rothley is the home of the suffragan Bishop of Loughborough.
In 1988 Rothley was involved in a cricketing controversy, when then-England captain Mike Gatting was accused by &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; newspapers of improprieties with a barmaid at the Rothley Court Hotel. These accusations led to the sacking of Gatting as captain, despite his protestations of innocence.

In May 2007, Madeleine McCann, who lived in Rothley, disappeared when on holiday in Portugal shortly before her fourth birthday. The village square was decorated with yellow ribbons, teddy bears, notes and cards by people wanting to show support. In September, Rothley became the centre of international media attention when McCann&#x27;s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, returned to their home after being formally named as suspects in the investigation into Madeleine&#x27;s disappearance. The heavy media presence in the village led to tension between journalists and the local community, the majority of whom responded by declining reporters&#x27; requests for comment about the case.

==Sport==
The town also has its own non league football club, Rothley Imperial F.C. who currently play in the at Loughborough Road.

<text>In France, the Chemin des Dames (; literally, the &quot;ladies&#x27; path&quot;) is part of the route départementale (local road) D18 and runs east and west in the Aisne department, between in the west, the Route Nationale 2 (Laon to Soissons), and in the east, the D1044 at Corbeny. It is some long and runs along a ridge between the valleys of the rivers Aisne and Ailette.

It acquired the name in the 18th century, as it was the route taken by the two daughters of Louis XV, Adélaïde and Victoire, who were known as &quot;Ladies of France&quot;. At the time, it was scarcely a carriage road, but it was the most direct route between Paris and the , near Vauclair, on the far side of the Ailette. The château belonged to Françoise de Châlus, former mistress of Louis XV, Countess of Narbonne-Lara and former lady of honour to Adélaïde, whom the two ladies visited frequently. To make the way easier, the count had the road surfaced, and it gained its new name. The ridge&#x27;s strategic importance first became evident in 1814 when Napoleon&#x27;s young recruits defeated an army of Prussians and Russians at the Battle of Craonne.

==World War I==

Three battles were fought along the Chemin des Dames east-to-west ridge located to the north of Paris during the First World War. All are named after the river which flows on the south side of the ridge. Their names are as follows:
* First Battle of the Aisne (1914) – Anglo-French counter-offensive following the First Battle of the Marne.
* Second Battle of the Aisne (1917) – main component of the Nivelle Offensive.
* Third Battle of the Aisne (1918) – third phase (Operation Blücher) of the German spring offensive.

During World War I, the Chemin Des Dames lay in that sector of the Western Front held by the French Army. Its strategic importance made it the staging ground of several major battles that took place between 1914 and 1918. The German army took a defensive stand on the ridge in September 1914, stopping the advancing Allied armies after the Battle of the Marne. After intensive combat, Germans took control of the plateau in November 1914. The front line then remained static until March 1917, during which time several thousand soldiers died in local attacks or coup de main operations. On 25 January 1915 German forces captured the Creute farm (today &quot;La Caverne du Dragon&quot; or the Dragon&#x27;s Lair), the last remaining French position on the plateau.
The best-known battle, called the Second Battle of the Aisne, took place between 16 April and 25 April 1917. To soften up the German defences, General Robert Nivelle, an artilleryman by training and experience, inflicted a six-day artillery preparation involving 5,300 guns. This, of course, provided ample warning that a major French attack was coming. Then, on 16 April, seven French army corps attacked the German line along the Chemin des Dames ridge. But, Nivelle had underestimated the enemy&#x27;s defensive preparations: The Germans had created a network of deep shelters in old underground stone quarries below the ridge, where their troops took shelter from the French barrage. The German positions also dominated the southerly slope over which the French attackers were progressing. On the first day, French infantry and some colonial Senegalese troops progressed to the top of the ridge in spite of intense German artillery counterfire and poor weather conditions. However, as French infantry reached the plateau, the advance was slowed and then stopped by the intense fire of a very high number of the Germans&#x27; new MG08/15 machine guns. As a result, the French took 40,000 casualties on the first day alone. Furthermore, during the following 12 days of the battle, French losses continued to rise to 120,000 casualties (dead, wounded, and missing). The final count, when the offensive was over, was 187,000 French casualties and 163,000 Germans casualties. The German defenders suffered much less, but lost some 20,000 prisoners, 40 cannons, and 200 machine guns. The high French casualty count, in so few days and with such minimal gains, was perceived at headquarters and by the French public as a disaster. Furthermore, the agonizingly slow evacuation of the French wounded also demonstrated a lack of logistical preparations. Nivelle had to resign, and the French Army became plagued by many refusals to march amounting to mutinies in several infantry divisions.
This situation developed into a threat of complete disintegration. General Philippe Pétain, who had opposed this offensive, was called in to take over from Nivelle and to re-establish order. This he did without harsh collective punishments. A total of 629 men were sentenced to death, but only 28 men, who had fired weapons at their superiors, were executed. Conversely, Pétain instituted positive changes, such as longer home leaves and better food and medical/surgical assistance for the troops. By the Summer of 1917, order had returned to the French army, which won a major victory that August on the left bank of the Meuse at Verdun, driving the Germans from the positions they had taken at such high cost there in 1916. During the summer of 1917, the Battle of the Observatories comprised a series of local attacks and counterattacks to gain control of high positions commanding the views between Craonne and Laffaux, in which the French improved their tactical position in the sector. In October, the crushing French victory at the Battle of La Malmaison drove German forces completely off the Chemin des Dames, forcing them North to the Ailette River valley.

The Third Battle of the Aisne came as a complete surprise to the Allies, including British troops who had been sent there to rest in a quiet sector. A German breakthrough was aided by orders of a French general to mass troops in the front line – a tactic by this date discredited. The penetration broke into open country and fighting went on from 27 May to 6 June 1918, but ran out of energy owing to lack of a strategic objective and lengthening supply lines. During the Second Battle of the Marne, the last fight on the Chemin des Dames occurred between 2 August and 10 October 1918.


== Today ==
There are numerous war memorials and cemeteries, German, French and British, all along the chemin. Beneath the ridge is an almost square kilometre (250 acre)cave network called &quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; (&quot;La Caverne du Dragon&quot;). The caverns originally were a tunnel system created from excavations of limestone for building purposes in the 17th century. The caves are some below the surface. During World War I, the caves were used by both French and German forces as field hospitals and command posts, sometimes simultaneously. The artillery bombardment of the area actually cracked some of the overlying cliffs, which can be seen today. A noteworthy visitors&#x27; centre that offers guided tours is now located at the site. In January 2020, the father-son team of Alain and Pierre Malinowski discovered the entrance to the long buried tunnel. The remains of over 270 German soldiers have been recovered to date.

The route was used during Stage 6 of the 2014 Tour de France as part of the race&#x27;s tribute to the men killed in the 1914–18 War.
