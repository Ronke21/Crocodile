<text>Ashford is a town in Spelthorne, in Surrey, England, including some areas within the London Borough of Hounslow. The town lies west of central London. Its name derives from a crossing point of the River Ash, a distributary of the River Colne.Geographically part of Middlesex, the town falls under Surrey council since 1965. Ashford consists of relatively low density low- and medium-rise buildings, none of them being high rise. If excluding apartments (at the last census 27% of the housing stock) most houses are semi-detached. In 2011 it had a population of 27,382.

Ashford railway station, on the Waterloo to Reading Line, is served by South Western Railway. Heathrow Airport is north of the town.

A leading gymnastics club, HMP Bronzefield and one of the sites of Brooklands College are in the town. Ashford Hospital, which began as a workhouse, is to the north of the town centre. Ashford Common has a parade of shops and is a more residential ward that includes part of Queen Mary Reservoir and all of its related water treatment works. The town is surrounded by some areas of green space including The Princes Club, Bedfont Lakes and Shortwood Common.

==Topography==

Ashford is in the almost flat alluvial plain formed by the historic courses of the River Thames on fairly fertile but gravelly soil in centuries past covered by deciduous forest for wood gathering, with clearings of meadow for pasture and to a lesser extent arable farming to supply the London market; sheep grazing continues today around the reservoirs. In common with western fringes of Greater London, gravel commences often within a metre of the surface which has led to 20th-century gravel extraction, which has formed the lakes to the north of the railway line. The extreme west is Shortwood Common, partly converted to a recreation ground, Ashford Park School, a cemetery.

North of this is the pair of Staines Reservoirs, the other green buffer is The Princes Club, Bedfont Lakes, spanning the northeast border; these areas constitute Metropolitan Green Belt buffers to the country&#x27;s largest city. The area includes postally much of Queen Mary Reservoir (which covered most of the parish to the south of Littleton and almost none of historic Ashford) named after the wife of George V, Mary of Teck.

Most of the land is devoted to suburban and low-rise urban housing – as well as recreational areas, green belt in part of the Bedfont/Feltham fringe exists in the form of meadows used for walking, horse grazing and equestrianism around Feltham Young Offenders&#x27; Institution. A few parks such as the Ashford Reservoirs or Spelthorne Park are remnants of Ashford Common which give the eastern part of the town a reminder of its past status as a grazing common; these include recreation grounds such as Thames Water-sponsored Spelthorne Sports Club and the BP recreation ground.

In The Clumps, 37 houses in the Ashford post town, which has the postcode TW15, are in the London Borough of Hounslow, Greater London, alongside the Princes Club watersports lakes partly in Ashford post town but mostly in East Bedfont, Feltham post town, London. The other road with this status is the western half of Challenge Road, which has only business addresses.

==History==
Bronze Age artefacts have been found in Ashford (at 51.432708N, 0.485174W) giving rise to the name Bronzefield and a henge may have been present in that period. Ashford appears on the Middlesex &quot;Domesday&quot; map as &quot;Exeforde&quot;, held by Robert, Count of Mortain. Its Domesday assets were: 1 plough, meadow for 1 plough; a separate manor in 1066, it was part of the manor of Kempton in 1086. It rendered (in total) 14s 0d. Throughout the early medieval period the place was also referred to as Echelford.

A stone bridge was built over the ford in 1789 by the Hampton and Staines Turnpike Trust

Ashford Common was a large area of common land in the south and east of the town that the British Army used for military displays in the reign of George III. It was inclosed in 1809.

Ashford Manor Golf Club was established in 1902 at the property which was the Manor Farm House but the large manorial estate and manor house that were held by Solomon Abraham Hart from 1870 to 1882 had before 1902 been broken up among many small owners, and all trace of the manor house was lost.However the title of Lord of the Manor was acquired by Scott Freeman in 1890, and after passing to another partner of the solicitors Horne, Engall &amp; Freeman the title passed in more recent times to Russell Grant.

Ashford&#x27;s housing stock is chiefly a mixture of detached and semi-detached housing built between 1885 and 1960.

===Former schools===

The Welsh School (later St David&#x27;s School) was founded in 1857. Its building north of Ashford railway station is Gothic Revival, designed by Henry Clutton. St David&#x27;s School is now defunct, but in 2010 its buildings and playing fields became the premises of St James Senior Boys School.
Ashford County Grammar School was founded in 1911. It became Ashford Sixth Form College in 1975 and Spelthorne College later. In 2007 it merged with Brooklands College. A property developer, Inland Homes plc, has since acquired the former grammar school buildings in Church Road. In 2017 it started to demolish the buildings without planning permission. The developer stopped the work at the request of Spelthorne Borough Council after demolition had started, but later continued the demolition, having received planning permission to build 357 new homes on the site.

===Civic administration===
In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, Ashford became part of the Staines Rural District of Middlesex. In 1930 the rural district was abolished and joined Staines Urban District. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, Middlesex County Council was abolished and the urban district was transferred to Surrey. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Staines Urban District was abolished and its area combined with that of Sunbury-on-Thames Urban District to create the present borough of Spelthorne.

In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 16,502. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

==Churches==

The present Church of England parish church of St Matthew in Church Road was built in 1856–58 with financial help from the Welsh School. It was sited some yards west of Ashford&#x27;s earlier parish church of St Michael, parts of which were Norman. St Michael&#x27;s was demolished, but internal monuments and a 12th-century arch from it were incorporated into St Matthew&#x27;s. William Butterfield designed St Matthew&#x27;s in a Gothic Revival style. The tower was not completed until 1865.

St Hilda&#x27;s parish church at the junction of Stanwell and Woodthorpe Roads was founded as a daughter church of St Matthew&#x27;s to serve the rapidly expanding community around the railway station. Construction started in 1912 and most of the church was built in the first few years, but the chancel and some other parts were not completed until 1928. St Hilda&#x27;s original design included a spire that would have been one of the most significant landmarks in the area, but it was never built. St Hilda&#x27;s was initially a conventual district of St Matthew&#x27;s parish, but is now a separate ecclesiastical parish. The easternmost parts of Ashford Common are in the parish of St Saviour&#x27;s, Sunbury.
The Roman Catholic Church of St Michael in Fordbridge Road was begun in 1927 and the uncompleted building was consecrated in 1928. It was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott in a Romanesque Revival style. Building continued in 1938, but the tower was not completed until 1960.

Ashford has two Methodist churches: one on Clarendon Road and the other in Ashford Common on Feltham hill Road.

There is a Congregational church in Clarendon Road.

The Salvation Army has a citadel in Woodthorpe Road.

==Economy==
The main street, Church Road, has local businesses, including Co-op, Tesco Express, Costa Coffee, Sainsbury&#x27;s, several estate agents, three funeral directors, and several places to eat. Church Road is also home to Ashford Library and a prominent World War I memorial.
There are several pubs in the town including the King&#x27;s Fairway, the District Arms, the King&#x27;s Head, the Freemans Arms, and the Bulldog (a Harvester gastropub).

Ashford, in common with most of London suburbia, has very low unemployment rates. A great deal of local employment is directly related to Heathrow Airport. BP International is another major employer. Many other residents work in London or in the Thames Valley. Main dealers of Ford, Citroën and formerly Suzuki are along the town&#x27;s outlying dual carriageway roads.

The town previously had multiple high street banks including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander, however all of these have since closed. The Barclays branch located on Church Road was the site of an attempted robbery in June 2010, when a man armed with an imitation gun and a fake bomb took multiple hostages, demanding £800,000 and a helicopter. All of the hostages were either released or escaped before the perpetrator surrendered to police.

==Transport==
===Railway===
 is on the Waterloo to Reading Line, with South Western Railway stopping services from London Waterloo on two of its three routes, those to and to Weybridge on the South West Main Line via the Chertsey Line. The station is referred to in timetables as Ashford (Surrey) in order to avoid confusion with Ashford International station in Kent.

===Roads===
Not far north of the station is the A30 dual carriageway, which marks much of Ashford&#x27;s northern border. It follows the old route from London to Devon and Cornwall. The alignment of this road is WSW–ENE.

A straight relief road, roughly WNW–ESE, was built by the Hampton and Staines Turnpike Trust. Now the A308, it has become a dual carriageway from Sunbury Cross to the junction with the A30 at Staines. This road marks some of the town&#x27;s southern border. Ashford is close to the M25, M3 and A3 roads.

===Buses===
The town is on Hallmark Connections route 555 from Heathrow Airport to Walton-on-Thames, on three Transport for London routes, the 117, 216 and 290, also serving Isleworth, Kingston upon Thames and Twickenham respectively, and more occasional routes, including special school services run by other operators.

===Further education===
Ashford&#x27;s further education college, Spelthorne College, became a Brooklands College Campus in 2007. In 2016 the Ashford Campus relocated to a new building adjacent to Thomas Knyvett College, and the former Spelthorne College site was demolished. It serves 16 to 18 year olds from a wide area of Surrey.

==Sport==

Active sports clubs in Ashford competitive at many levels are: Ashford Town F.C., Ashford Casuals F.C. and Ashford Cricket Club. Clubs exist for hockey, tennis, table Tennis, aikido, karate, golf and bowls, with leading clubs in acrobatic gymnastics and sailing which offer professional coaching from Olympic-level coaches.

Ashford Manor Golf Club is described above, a golf course that has 18 holes; one other is in the borough, Sunbury Golf Course in Charlton. In 1921, the golf course was the site of the murder of British spy Vincent Fovargue by the IRA.

Spelthorne Atoms (previously known as Ashford Atoms) are one of the best youth basketball teams in the country having been to the national finals on a number of occasions.

Spelthorne Gymnastics club is one of the World&#x27;s premier clubs for acrobatic gymnastics, having won eight World championship gold medals.

==Watercourses==

Ashford has one river, the River Ash, one of the six distributaries of the River Colne which runs in line with the Staines bypass under the Fordbridge roundabout at the far end of Fordbridge Road, its upper reach being the traditional border with Staines and then entering Laleham, passing close to the other side of the Queen Mary Reservoir.

The Staines Reservoirs Aqueduct (built 1902) flows from west to east across Ashford. It carries water from the Staines Reservoirs and King George VI Reservoir to Hampton water treatment works via Sunbury and Kempton Park.

==Government==
Ashford is part of the Spelthorne parliamentary constituency which was represented by the Conservative Kwasi Kwarteng from 2010 to 2024. After Stepping down Kwarteng was replaced by Conservative MP Lincoln Jopp.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command line utility on Unix and Unix-like operating systems which is used to extract sections from each line of input — usually from a file. It is currently part of the GNU coreutils package and the BSD Base System.

Extraction of line segments can typically be done by bytes (codice_2), characters (codice_3), or fields (codice_4) separated by a delimiter (codice_5 — the tab character by default). A range must be provided in each case which consists of one of codice_6, codice_7 codice_8 (codice_6 to the end of the line), or codice_10 (beginning of the line to codice_11), where N and M are counted from 1 (there is no zeroth value). Since version 6, an error is thrown if you include a zeroth value. Prior to this the value was ignored and assumed to be 1.

==History==
The original Bell Labs version was written by Gottfried W. R. Luderer. is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. It first appeared in AT&amp;T System III UNIX in 1982.

The version of codice_12 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by David M. Ihnat, David MacKenzie, and Jim Meyering. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

==Examples==
Assuming a file named &quot;codice_13&quot; containing the lines:
 foo:bar:baz:qux:quux
 one:two:three:four:five:six:seven
 alpha:beta:gamma:delta:epsilon:zeta:eta:theta:iota:kappa:lambda:mu
 the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

To output the fourth through tenth characters of each line:

$ cut -c 4-10 file
:bar:ba
:two:th
ha:beta
 quick 

To output the fifth field through the end of the line of each line using the colon character as the field delimiter:

$ cut -d &quot;:&quot; -f 5- file
quux
five:six:seven
epsilon:zeta:eta:theta:iota:kappa:lambda:mu
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
(note that because the colon character is not found in the last line the entire line is shown)

Option codice_5 specifies a single character delimiter (in the example above it is a colon) which serves as field separator. Option codice_4 which specifies range of fields included in the output (here fields range from five till the end). Option codice_5 presupposes usage of option codice_4.

To output the third field of each line using space as the field delimiter:

$ cut -d &quot; &quot; -f 3 file
foo:bar:baz:qux:quux
one:two:three:four:five:six:seven
alpha:beta:gamma:delta:epsilon:zeta:eta:theta:iota:kappa:lambda:mu
brown

(Note that because the space character is not found in the first three lines these entire lines are shown.)

To separate two words having any delimiter:

$ line=process.processid
$ cut -d &quot;.&quot; -f1 «&lt; $line
process
$ cut -d &quot;.&quot; -f2 «&lt; $line
processid
==Syntax==
 cut [-b list] [-c list] [-f list] [-n] [-d delim] [-s] [file]

Flags which may be used include:
; : Bytes; a list following specifies a range of bytes which will be returned, e.g. would return the first 66 bytes of a line. NB If used in conjunction with , no multi-byte characters will be split. NNB. will only work on input lines of less than 1023 bytes
; : Characters; a list following specifies a range of characters which will be returned, e.g. would return the first 66 characters of a line
; : Specifies a field list, separated by a delimiter
; list : A comma separated or blank separated list of integer denoted fields, incrementally ordered. The indicator may be supplied as shorthand to allow inclusion of ranges of fields e.g. for ranges 4–6 or as shorthand for field 5 to the end, etc.
; : Used in combination with -b suppresses splits of multi-byte characters
; : Delimiter; the character immediately following the option is the field delimiter for use in conjunction with the option; the default delimiter is &quot;tab&quot;. Space and other characters with special meanings within the context of the shell in use must be enquoted or escaped as necessary.
; : Bypasses lines which contain no field delimiters when is specified, unless otherwise indicated.
; file : The file (and accompanying path if necessary) to process as input. If no file is specified then standard input will be used.

<doc id="821611" wikidata="Q3622925" url="?curid=821611" title="Complex harmonic motion">
<text>In physics, complex harmonic motion is a complicated realm based on the simple harmonic motion. The word &quot;complex&quot; refers to different situations. Unlike simple harmonic motion, which is regardless of air resistance, friction, etc., complex harmonic motion often has additional forces to dissipate the initial energy and lessen the speed and amplitude of an oscillation until the energy of the system is totally drained and the system comes to rest at its equilibrium point.

== Types ==

=== Damped harmonic motion ===

==== Introduction ====
Damped harmonic motion is a real oscillation, in which an object is hanging on a spring. Because of the existence of internal friction and air resistance, the system will over time experience a decrease in amplitude. The decrease of amplitude is due to the fact that the energy goes into thermal energy.

Damped harmonic motion happens because the spring is not very efficient at storing and releasing energy so that the energy dies out. The damping force is proportional to the velocity of the object and is at the opposite direction of the motion so that the object slows down quickly. Specifically, when an object is damping, the damping force formula_1 will be related to velocity formula_2 by a coefficient formula_3:
:formula_4

The diagram shown on the right indicates three types of damped harmonic motion. 
* Critically damped: The system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating.
* Underdamped: The system oscillates (at reduced frequency compared to the undamped case) with the amplitude gradually decreasing to zero.
* Overdamped: The system returns (exponentially decays) to equilibrium without oscillating.

==== Difference between damped and forced oscillation ====
An object or a system is oscillating in its own natural frequency without the interference of an external periodic force or initial motion. Damped oscillation is similar to forced oscillation except that it has continuous and repeated force. Hence, these are two motions that have opposite results.
==== Examples ====
# Bungee jumper provides a large force of bouncing by compressing the springs underneath it. The compression theoretically turns the kinetic energy into elastic potential energy. When the elastic potential energy reaches its top boundary, it can be exerted onto the object or child that presses on it within the form of kinetic energy.
# Rubber band works the same as the spring.

=== Resonance ===
==== Introduction ====
Resonance occurs when the frequency of the external force (applied) is the same as the natural frequency (resonant frequency) of the system. When such a situation occurs, the external force always acts in the same direction as the motion of the oscillating object, with the result that the amplitude of the oscillation increases indefinitely, as it&#x27;s shown in the adjacent diagram. Away from the value of resonant frequency, either greater or lesser, the amplitude of the corresponding frequency is smaller.

In a set of driving pendulums with different length of strings hanging objects, the one pendulum with the same length of string as the driver gets the biggest amplitude of swinging.

==== Examples ====
* Parts of a car may vibrate if you drive over a bumpy road at a speed where the vibrations transmitted to the body are at the resonant frequency of that part (though most cars are designed with parts with natural frequencies that are not likely to be produced by driving).
* Bass frequencies from stereo speakers can make a room resonate, particularly annoying if you live next door and your living room resonates due to your neighbour&#x27;s music.
* A man walks across a field carrying a long plank on his shoulder. At each step the plank flexes a little (a) and the ends move up and down. He then starts to trot and as a result bounces up and down (b). At one particular speed resonance will occur between the motion of the man and the plank and the ends of the plank then oscillate with large amplitude.
* When using a microwave oven to cook food, the micro wave travels through the food, causing the water molecules vibrate in the same frequency, which is similar to resonance, so that the food as a whole, gets hot fast.
* Some of the helicopter crashes are caused by resonance too. The eyeballs of the pilot resonate because of excessive pressure in the upper air, making the pilot unable to see overhead power lines. As a result, the helicopter is out of control.
* Resonance of two identical tune forks.
* Mircrowave ovens use resonance to vibrate polar molecules which collide and manifest their energy transfer as heat.

=== Double pendulum ===

==== Introduction ====
A double pendulum is a simple pendulum hanging under another one; the epitome of the compound pendulum system. It shows abundant dynamic behavior. The motion of a double pendulum seems chaotic. We can hardly see a regulated routine that it is following, making it complicated. Varying lengths and masses of the two arms can make it hard to identify the centers of the two rods. Moreover, a double pendulum may exert motion without the restriction of only a two-dimensional (usually vertical) plane. In other words, the complex pendulum can move to anywhere within the sphere, which has the radius of the total length of the two pendulums. However, for a small angle, the double pendulum can act similarly to the simple pendulum because the motion is determined by sine and cosine functions as well.

==== Examples ====
The image shows a marine clock with motor springs and double pendulum sheel.

<text>Farmers and Merchants Bank (F&amp;M) was a lending institution (1871−1952) based in Downtown Los Angeles, California. It is recognized both for its architecture and its pivotal role in the economic development of early Los Angeles. Other, non-related &quot;F&amp;M Banks&quot; exist in various cities and towns across the United States.

==History==
The Farmers and Merchants Bank was founded in 1871 by 23 prominent Los Angeles businessmen, with an initial capital of $500,000. The three largest subscribers were financier Isaias W. Hellman ($100,000), former California Governor John G. Downey ($100,000), and Ozro W. Childs ($50,000) who in later years became the founders of the University of Southern California. Other investors included Charles Ducommun ($25,000), I.M. Hellman ($20,000), and Jose Mascarel ($10,000.). Its original location was at the Pico Building, on Main Street, between what is now US 101 and Temple, roughly at the site of the &quot;Triforium&quot;.

The Farmers and Merchants Bank was the first incorporated bank in Los Angeles, founded in 1871 by Isaias W. Hellman, a successful merchant, real estate investor, and banker who immigrated to Los Angeles in 1859; with John G. Downey, the seventh governor of California; and Herman W. Hellman, the brother of Isaias. Downey was named the first president, with Isaias actually running the bank. Isaias served as president of the bank from 1890 until his death in 1920.

The bank built and moved into new offices designed by architect Ezra F. Kysor in 1874 across the street from the Pico Building. The Los Angeles National Bank moved into its facilities in the Pico Building. In 1883 the F&amp;M Bank moved again, to Main and Commercial streets.
I.W. Hellman, was a cautious lender, insisting that major borrowers have good character and provide good security. Its subsequent presidents, J.A. Graves (who had been Hellman&#x27;s attorney) and Victor H. Rosetti, continued Hellman&#x27;s conservative practices, with a large portion of the bank&#x27;s capital constantly held in Treasury securities. As a result, the Bank survived every economic panic period, from the Panic of 1873, Panic of 1893, and Panic of 1896, through the Great Depression.
However, a one-branch downtown bank was eventually seen as not likely to continue to grow. In 1956, it merged with Security First National Bank, which became in later years Security Pacific National Bank, and ultimately was acquired by the Bank of America.

The location of the bank prior to 1905 was on the southeast corner of Main and Commercial streets.

==Architecture==
Designed in the Classical Revival style, the 1905 Farmers and Merchants Bank remains one of Southern California&#x27;s finest examples of the early &quot;temples of finance&quot; which were popular at the turn of the century. Its two-story facade, reminiscent of a Roman temple, is punctuated by an entrance framed with Corinthian columns topped by a large triangular pediment. Built in 1905, the bank was designed by the firm of Morgan and Walls.

==Present day==
The Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank building has been established as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #271.
Much of the original banking room remains, including light fixtures, a central skylight, and the loggia with its Victorian-style railings. Operating as a bank until its closure in the late 80s, the building now functions primarily as a special events and banquet facility and film location. The building is slated for renovation by developer Tom Gilmore and Associates.

<text>Domingo Amestoy —born Dominique— (c. 1822–1892) was a Basque sheepherder, and banker, one of the original founders to provide the financing for the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Los Angeles, California, in 1871.

==Life==
Born in the Basque village of Saint-Pierre-d&#x27;Irube, France, Domingo Amestoy came to California by way of Argentina in 1851. Amestoy started a modest sheep business and within a few years he parlayed it into a fortune. He was one of the largest wool producers in Southern California during the 1860s. In 1871, he bought $500,000 worth of shares in the newly established Farmers and Merchants Bank in Los Angeles. In 1874 he went back to France and married. In 1875 Amestoy moved his family to of the &quot;Rosecrans Rancho&quot; in what is now Gardena. By 1880, he had over 30,000 head of sheep, most of which were fine-wooled Spanish merinos.

In 1889 he acquired all of Rancho Los Encinos in the San Fernando Valley. After Domingo Amestoy died on January 11, 1892, his sons, John and Peter Amestoy, assumed ranch operations and changed the name to Amestoy ranch. Like other ranches in the San Fernando Valley at the time, the Amestoys cultivated wheat and barley. The Amestoy family held title to rancho for fifty-five years. In 1915, subdivision of the rancho began later developing into the communities of Sherman Oaks and Encino. The Amestoys held on to , which included the old adobe until selling the property in 1944.

==Legacy==
Amestoy Elementary School in Gardena, California was named in his honor. Amestoy Avenue in the San Fernando Valley was named in his honor. Amestoy Avenue runs approximately North-South through the neighborhoods of Encino, Reseda, Northridge, and Granada Hills from Ventura Boulevard (interrupted) to the 118 Freeway.

<doc id="821679" wikidata="Q3533478" url="?curid=821679" title="Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College">
<text>Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College, named after Swami Vivekananda, was formally inaugurated on 21 June 1946 by professor, philosopher, and politician, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. It is in Mylapore, the centre of Chennai, India, on 20 acres (81,000 m2). This college is part of various educational institutions owned by Ramakrishna Mission.

==History==
The college was founded with the help of a group of philanthropists and educationists, the prime mover being M. Subbaraya Aiyar, then a prominent income tax lawyer of Madras and the founding secretary from 1947 to 1960. Aiyar co-founded two other educational institutions: Vidya Mandir in Mylapore and the Madras Institute of Technology in Chromepet. Vivekananda College began with 20 teachers and 339 students. The college then offered just four undergraduate courses. Vivekananda College was subsequently handed over to the sole control of Ramakrishna Mission and renamed Vivekananda College, a unit of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Chennai. It offers instruction in English and admits only male students.

==Affiliation and accreditation==
The college has been re-accredited with &quot;A+&quot; grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in 2017. The college has been granted autonomous status by the University Grants Commission, New Delhi in 2004–05 to all the courses up to M. Phil degree. It is affiliated to the University of Madras and provides arts, science and commerce courses at the Bachelors, Master&#x27;s and Doctoral levels.

==Infrastructure==
The college has a main block, a Math block, a Life Sciences block, a Sanskrit block, the Obul Reddy Auditorium block, an open-air theatre, a Library block with 87,000 books in the day college and 8,000 in the evening college, a sports complex and a prayer hall. The college has a turf cricket ground, tennis court and gymnasium. Computer labs have Internet facilities.

==Training to youth==
The college authorities have introduced National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme, Youth Red Cross and Rotary Wings for students. Youth are trained in conducting night schools, laying the roads, educating slum dwellers, service to the handicapped, tree plantation, and health programmes.

==Academics==
The college runs eleven graduate and seven postgraduate programmes in the Shift-I and nine Undergraduate and two postgraduate programmes in the Shift-II. Undergraduate degrees include B.Com, B.A, B.Sc, B.B.A, B.C.A degrees in Shift-II. Postgraduate degrees award M.A. and M.SC., and in addition M.S.W. in Shift-II. There are research departments conducting PhD. In 2024 a new PG course on M.Com Accounting &amp; Finance and a new UG course BSc. Big Data Analytics was started in Shift-II.

===Scientific research===
The departments of botany, chemistry, physics, mathematics, economics, philosophy and Sanskrit offer research programmes. The Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith had two research institutes: Vivekananda Institute of Tropical Mycology (VINSTROM) and Vivekananda Institute of Algal Technology (VIAT). They have originated from the department of botany. VIAT got discontinued, while VINSTROM is growing from strength to strength. 

===Vivekananda Institute of Tropical Mycology===
Mycological research in the Department of Plant Biology and Plant Biotechnology dates back to 1980s. Sustained research by Dr. T. S. Suryanarayanan for over 35 years in experimental mycology, environmental mycology, marine mycology and endophyte ecology and physiology brought international recognition to the college in general and the mycology research team in particular. As a mark of appreciation and encouragement, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, under the secretaryship of Swami Satyapriyananda, created a separate institute – Vivekananda Institute of Tropical Mycology (VINSTROM) — in 2005 to continue the research in mycology under the directorship of Dr. T. S. Suryanarayanan. The year 2024 marks the 20th year of successful functioning and was commemorated by conducting an International Conference on &quot;Fungal Interactions with Plants and Animals - Scoping for the Future&quot;.

VINSTROM focuses its efforts on understanding the biodiversity and technological potential of microfungi in forests and other environments. Articles are published in international magazines.

===Vivekananda Institute of Algal Technology===
VIAT was inaugurated by Swami Satyapriyananda, secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, in April 2006.

Based on the success of this new technology, industries such as Wheels India are seeking solutions for effective effluent treatment through phycoremediation. Sivasubramanian has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chennai-based Indo-Japan joint venture company M/s Nichi-In Biosciences for a research project with emphasis on microbial biotechnology and environment safety to develop technology for environment-friendly plastic materials, to find ways to safely dispose the plastic materials using microbes and develop and validate polymers useful for water conservation in agriculture and horticulture. This project is supported by Japanese institutes like Waseda University, Yamanashi Medical University and Mebiol Inc., whose Indian operation is headed by Dr. Samuel J. K. Abraham, a cardiac surgeon. Prof. Mori Yuichi of Waseda University, Japan, and Dr. Yoshioka Hiroshi of Mebiol Inc., are participating in this collaboration.

===PG and Research Department of Mathematics===
Areas of research in the department are number theory, applied statistics, representation theory, algebra, functional analysis, topology algebraic geometry and Fluid dynamics. The department conducts monthly seminars and colloquiums, and hosts a yearly international conference in a particular area of mathematics. It has funding and support from the UGC, National Board for Higher Mathematics, Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India and Govt. of Tamil Nadu. More than 60 international papers were published during 2017-2023 from the mathematics department of Vivekananda college.

==Events==
The college Silver Jubilee was celebrated in 1971, the Jubilee in 1996, and the Diamond Jubilee from January 2006 to January 2007.
As a part of its Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the Vidyapith organized the two-day exhibition Enrich-2006 on 6 and 7 October. It highlighted the activities of the centres of Ramakrishna Sangha, the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother and Swami Vivekananda, and the recent developments in science, commerce, and humanities. Nearly 1500 students from neighbouring schools visited the exhibition. The year 2024 marks the 50th year of successful functioning of the Shift-II (popularly known as the evening college). To commemorate this a new PG program and a new UG program was launched in Shift-II.

<text>Shri Purohit Swami ( – 1941) was a Hindu teacher from Maharashtra, India.

== Biography ==

Purohit was born Shankar Gajannan Purohit in Badnera, then in British India&#x27;s Bombay Presidency, to a wealthy Marathi Brahmin family.

As a child he became proficient in Marathi, English, and Sanskrit. He was well educated, obtaining a B.A. in philosophy at Calcutta University in 1903 and a law degree from Deccan College and Bombay University.

As a teenager, he decided to be celibate (as a &quot;brahmacharya&quot;), but in 1908 he accommodated his parents&#x27; wishes and married Godu Bai. After the birth of daughters in 1910 and 1914, and a son in 1915, he resumed his vow of celibacy.

A year or two before his marriage, he met a young man four years older than himself named Natekar. Purohit says this meeting &quot;was love at first sight,&quot; and Natekar, who later took the monastic name Bhagwan Shri Hamsa, became Purohit&#x27;s guru.

In 1923 his guru directed him to embark on a mendicant pilgrimage the length and breadth of India. Begging bowl in hand, he passed several years in this way. He travelled to Europe on an extended visit in 1930.

== Friendship with Yeats ==

In 1931, Thomas Sturge Moore introduced Purohit to the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. The two men struck up a friendship which lasted until Yeats&#x27;s death, collaborating on a number of literary projects.

Yeats wrote an introduction to Purohit&#x27;s 1932 book, &quot;The Autobiography of an Indian Monk: His Life And His Adventures&quot;. In 1934, Purohit was mentioned in Bhagwan Shri Hamsa&#x27;s book &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, supplemented with an introduction by Yeats. He worked with Yeats during 1935 and 1936, in Majorca, on the translations to &quot;The Ten Principal Upanishads&quot; (1938, Faber and Faber), and in 1938 published his own version of Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Aphorisms of Yoga&quot; with a handful of illustrated yoga exercises and postures. Yeats included him in the &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892–1935&quot;.

He translated the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; into English. Unlike most translations, Purohit Swami&#x27;s translates every word into English and avoids the use of Sanskrit concepts that may be unfamiliar to English-speakers, for example translating the word &quot;yoga&quot; as &quot;spirituality&quot;. He also avoids mentioning the Varna (caste) system; where the original &quot;Gita&quot; mentions the different &quot;varnas&quot; he interprets this as different occupations within society.

== Legacy ==

He represents a very important but largely unremembered link between the generation of Swami Vivekananda and the post-World War II society in which Eastern thought has become an accepted element of spiritual life.

Purohit is known in the West principally for his work on translations of major Hindu texts. During his state visit in June 2023 to the US, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi presented the Bidens with a first edition print of the book &quot;The Ten Principal Upanishads&quot; (1937), translated from Sanskrit by Purohit Swami and Yeats.

<text>The Lace Curtain was an occasional literary magazine founded and edited by Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce under their New Writers Press imprint. Both press and journal were dedicated to expanding the horizons of Irish poetry by rediscovering a native modernist tradition, publishing younger Irish poets who were working in modes that sat outside the mainstream and introducing innovative non-Irish writing to an Irish audience.

The journal ran to six issues spanning the period 1969–1978. Contributors included Anthony Cronin, Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, Michael Hartnett, Augustus Young, John Montague, Antonio Machado, Paul Durcan, Desmond O&#x27;Grady, Brian Coffey Denis Devlin, Georg Trakl, Samuel Beckett, Thomas MacGreevy, Thomas Kinsella, Derek Mahon, Austin Clarke and Pablo Neruda.

Ní Chuilleanáin co-founded &quot;Cyphers&quot;, which first appeared as &quot;The Lace Curtain&quot;″s penultimate edition was published.

<doc id="821741" wikidata="Q31883493" url="?curid=821741" title="Lever tumbler lock">
<text>A lever tumbler lock is a type of lock that uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In the simplest form of these, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past.

The number of levers may vary, but it is usually an odd number to ensure symmetry in locks that can be opened from both sides of the door. A minimum number of levers may be specified to provide an anticipated level of security .

== History ==
&quot;Double acting&quot; lever tumbler locks were invented in 1778 by Robert Barron of England. These required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today, on doors in Europe, Africa, South America and some other parts of the world. 

==Design==

The lock is made up of levers (usually made out of non-ferrous metals). Each lever needs to be lifted to a specific height by the key in order for the locking bolt to move. Typically, the belly of the lever is cut away to various depths to provide different combinations, or the gate is cut in a different location, to provide differs. A lever will have &quot;pockets&quot; (or &quot;gates&quot;) through which the bolt &quot;stump&quot; (or &quot;post&quot; or &quot;fence&quot;) moves during unlocking.

There has not always been universal agreement on which variants of the basic design merit the terms &quot;lever lock&quot; or &quot;detainer lock&quot; or both. Some authors use the term &quot;detainer lock&quot; to refer specifically to variants where the gates are &quot;open&quot; (i.e. at the edge of the lever), rather than &quot;closed&quot; (i.e. entirely surrounded by the lever).

Lever locks generally use a bitted key. Some locks used on safes use a double-bitted key (a key with cuts on both sides, increasing security), as do some door locks of a type often used in Southern and Eastern Europe.

=== Three-lever locks ===
A three-lever lock is a common type of lever lock, but is generally used for low security applications such as internal doors as their tolerances are much lower (there are fewer combinations of key available, so they are likely to unlock doors they shouldn&#x27;t).

=== Five-lever locks ===
A five-lever lock is often required for home insurance and recommended by the police for home security. There are various grades but the current British Standard (BS3621:2007) is usually required for insurance purposes. Locksmith Valerie Olifent states that, &quot;The doors of many historic churches still carry an old wooden lock although often you find that a modern 5-lever mortice lock has been installed alongside it to meet insurance requirements.&quot; BS3621:2007 requires a bolt throw of 20 mm rather than the 14 mm of the earlier British Standard.

Most BS3621 locks have anti-pick devices built in to reduce the chance of lock picking, along with hardened bolts and anti-drill plates to reduce risk of physical attack.

== Vulnerabilities ==
Lever tumbler locks can be picked with a tool called a &quot;curtain pick&quot; which is inserted into the keyway of the lock, and a force is applied to the locking bolt. The pick is then used to lift each lever inside the lock to the correct height so that the locking bolt can pass.

Higher security lever locks (such as the five-lever) usually have notches cut into the levers. These catch the locking bolt and prevent it from moving if picking is attempted (similar to the security pins in a pin tumbler lock).

The Chubb detector lock is a variation of the lever lock which was designed to detect and prevent picking attempts.

Lever locks can be drilled, but usually a template or stencil is required to mark the drilling point, as the lock mechanism is commonly mortised into the door and so it is harder to determine the point at which to drill.

<doc id="821778" wikidata="Q191119" url="?curid=821778" title="Rambouillet">
<text>Rambouillet (, , ) is a subprefecture of the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France region of France. It is located beyond the outskirts of Paris, southwest of its centre. In 2018, the commune had a population of 26,933.

Rambouillet lies on the edge of the vast Forest of Rambouillet (&quot;Forêt de Rambouillet&quot; or &quot;Forêt de l&#x27;Yveline&quot;); it is famous for its historical castle, the Château de Rambouillet, which hosted several international summits. Due to its proximity to Paris and Versailles, Rambouillet has long been an occasional seat of government.

==Population==

==Transport==
Rambouillet is served by the SNCF Rambouillet railway station on the Transilien Line N suburban rail line, and on the regional line to Chartres and Le Mans.

==Features==
*The Château de Rambouillet, a former medieval fortress, was acquired by Louis XVI of France in 1783 as a private residence because of its ideal situation in the game-rich forest of Rambouillet. It became a &quot;bien national&quot; during the French Revolution of 1789, and one of the imperial residences of Napoléon I during the First French Empire. At the time of the Bourbon Restoration, the castle became a royal residence, and it is there that Charles X signed his abdication on 2 August 1830. Sometimes neglected at times of political unrest, the château de Rambouillet became the official summer residence of the French President of the Republic after President Félix Faure chose it as summer residence for himself and his family in 1896; Rambouillet thus became the official summer residence of the Presidents of the Third Republic and has retained its position ever since.
*The Palace of the King of Rome. In 1784, on a parcel adjacent to the gardens of the castle, Louis XVI had ordered the construction of the &quot;Hôtel du Gouvernement&quot;, which was restored during the reign of Napoléon I, and renamed &quot;Palais du Roi de Rome&quot; as the official Rambouillet residence of Napoleon&#x27;s infant son Napoleon II. Its entrance is situated in the rue Charles de Gaulle, Rambouillet&#x27;s main street. 
*The Hôtel de Ville, the former &quot;Bailliage&quot; (Bailiwicks building) was built in 1786 at the request of Louis XVI by the architect Jacques-Jean Thévenin. It was given by Napoléon I to the inhabitants of Rambouillet to serve as their City Hall. The inscription over the doors of the City Hall reads &quot;Donated to the inhabitants of Rambouillet by Napoleon the Great, [in the] Year 1809&quot;.
*The new Saint-Lubin church was built between 1868 and 1871. Its architect was Anatole de Baudot, a student of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.
*The Bergerie nationale was built on the grounds of the Domain of Rambouillet at the request of Louis XVI, and is the home of the Rambouillet Merino sheep since 1786.
*The Laiterie de la Reine, the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Dairy&quot; also built on the grounds of the Domain of Rambouillet, is adjacent to the Bergerie. It was built in 1787 at the request of Louis XVI for his wife Marie Antoinette and designed by the architect Jean-Jacques Thévenin.
*The Chaumière des coquillages, a thatched-roof cottage with its marble interior decorated with shells and mother of pearl, was built in 1779–1780 in the English garden of the Domain of Rambouillet by Claude-Martin Goupy, the architect of the &quot;duc de Penthièvre&quot;, for the &quot;princesse de Lamballe&quot;, Penthièvre&#x27;s widowed daughter-in-law.
*The Musée Rambolitrain, situated across from the Saint-Lubin church, is a museum featuring miniature trains. We find a faithful reconstruction of a Parisian toy store of the 1930s.
*The Médiathèque La Lanterne, situated across from the Saint-Lubin church and the Musée Rambolitrain, is a media library and a concert hall. Link
*The Monument Américain (The American Eagle Monument), is situated at the south entrance of the town on the D 906 road to Chartres, at the site of two ambushes in which seven American soldiers were killed, on 16 August 1944. The monument was erected in 1947. It bears the inscription: &quot;À la mémoire des soldats américains tombés pour la libération de notre région en août 1944&quot;, &quot;In memory of the American soldiers fallen for the liberation of our region in August 1944&quot;. The names of nine American soldiers are inscribed on a plaque on the monument. Commemorative ceremonies are held at the monument every 19 August.

<text>A surgical mask, also known by other names such as a medical face mask or procedure mask, is a personal protective equipment used by healthcare professionals that serves as a mechanical barrier that interferes with direct airflow in and out of respiratory orifices (i.e. nose and mouth). This helps reduce airborne transmission of pathogens and other aerosolized contaminants between the wearer and nearby people via respiratory droplets ejected when sneezing, coughing, forceful expiration or unintentionally spitting when talking, etc. Surgical masks may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental or medical procedure masks.

Although the material of which surgical masks are made will filter out some viruses and bacteria by trapping the aerosol suspended in breathed air, they only provide partial protection from airborne diseases because of the typically loose fit between the mask edges and the wearer&#x27;s face. Surgical masks are distinct from filtering respirators, such as those made to the American N95 standard, which are more airtight and purposefully designed to protect against finer airborne particles.
Evidence from randomized controlled trials that surgical masks reduce infection from diseases such as influenza is weak. Although a recent very large (over 300,000 people) study found some evidence that they reduced transmission in the community, surgical masks can vary greatly in quality which may make these studies less useful. The effect of surgical masks is partially attributed to filtering out some of aerosol particles that are how airborne diseases are transmitted. Surgical masks are highly variable but the material of which they are made typically filter out more aerosol particles than do cloth masks but much less than does the material of which N95, FFP2 and similar masks, are made. This combined with the poor fit suggests that surgical masks offer some protection to airborne diseases such as COVID-19 but less than do N95, FFP2 and similar masks.

There are standards for the materials masks are made from. For example, the European EN 14683 Type II standard requires the material of the mask to filter particles (mean diameter close to 3 micrometres) containing the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The bacterial filtration efficiency of the mask material is the fractional reduction in the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) when the aerosol is passed through the material. For a Type II mask under this standard, the material must filter enough of the aerosol particles containing the bacteria to achieve a CFU reduction of at least 98%.

ASTM International has an F2100 standard with similar bacterial filtering standard to the European Type II standard but in addition uses a test aerosol of 0.1 micrometre particles. The Level 3 standard F2100 standard requires that these particles must be filtered out with at least 98% efficiency. Neither the European nor the ASTM standard tests performance as worn, they just test the material — the difference being the air leakage. This is different to personal protection equipment standards such as N95 and FFP, which do test performance as worn.

Surgical masks are made of a nonwoven fabric created using a melt blowing process. They came into use in the 1960s and largely replaced cloth facemasks in developed countries. The colored (usually dark blue, green, or occasionally yellow) side of the mask (fluid-repellant layer) is to be worn outwards, and the white side (absorbent layer) inwards.

In some East Asian countries, masks have often customarily been worn by people who are sick in order to avoid spreading it, to protect against air pollution or allergens, as a fashion statement, or to deter social interaction. The use of surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic was a subject of debate, as mask shortage was a central issue.

== Function ==

A surgical mask serves as a mechanical barrier that interferes with direct airflow in and out of respiratory orifices (i.e. nose and mouth). Most commonly used surgical masks are designed to only trap respiratory droplets, and therefore do not filter or block fine airborne particles that are smaller than the designed filtration ratings, which may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, unintentional spitting during talking, or certain aerosol-generating medical procedures (e.g. bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy or dental procedures). Surgical masks also cannot provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the often loose fit between the mask edges and the wearer&#x27;s face, especially when the mask is worn outright incorrectly (e.g. low with the nose and/or mouth exposed).

A surgical mask is a disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the respiratory tract openings (nose and mouth) of the wearer and potentially pathogenic contaminants in the immediate environment. If worn properly, surgical masks are meant to help block out most (if not all) large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria, keeping them from entering the wearer&#x27;s nose and mouth., and conversely are also effective barriers for retaining large droplets released from the wearer&#x27;s the mouth and nose. Surgical masks help reduce exposure of the wearer&#x27;s saliva and respiratory secretions to others that could otherwise travel up to . Surgical mask also remind wearers not to touch their mouth or nose, which could otherwise transfer viruses and bacteria after having touched a contaminated surface.

A surgical mask is not to be confused with a respirator (which is specifically rated for sub-micron particles) and is not certified as such. Surgical masks are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators, which are designed for this purpose. Collection efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% for different manufacturers’ masks when measured using the test parameters for NIOSH certification. However, a study found that even for surgical masks with &quot;good&quot; filters, 80–100% of subjects failed an OSHA-accepted qualitative fit test, and a quantitative test showed 12–25% leakage.

Modern surgical masks are made from paper or other non-woven material and should be discarded after each use.

=== Physical form ===

The design of the surgical masks depends on the intended usages. Usually, the masks are rectangular shaped with pleats to allow the wearer to expand and curve the mask so it can better cover the entirety of the area from the nose to around the chin. The outward-facing side of the mask is typically colored (usually blue, green, or yellow) and made thicker, tougher, and water impermeable. The inner layers of the mask are made of three-ply (three layers) melt-blown polymer (most commonly polypropylene) placed between non-woven fabric. The melt-blown material acts as the filter that stops microbes from penetrating and exiting the mask. Some masks have an attached thin polyethylene faceshield (known as a &quot;splash shield&quot;) to provide additional spray protection over the eye area.

A different type of mask, known as &quot;duckbill&quot; masks, uses a trapezoid pouch-like design that has significantly shortened side edges — sometimes none at all — to minimize loose gaps that pathogens can leak past. These masks are typically made to the N95/P2 standards, and are commonly used for clinical situations that demand fine particulates protection, such as tuberculosis.

Small strips of foam or thickened fabric are often sewn along the top edge of the mask to help better seal away exhaled water vapors (which can fog up eyewears and faceshields) and soak up excess perspiration dripping from above. Small bendable metal strips are frequently added to the top edge to better fit over the nasal bridge. Occasionally adhesive tapes can also be added to secure the seal and prevent the mask from slipping up and down.

The masks are typically fastened to the head with straps or elastic bands that are attached to the mask&#x27;s four corners. Straps come in four free-hanging ribbons that are manually tied in two pairs horizontally around the back of the head, and are most frequently used in surgical operations due to the ability to customize the strap length and tension comfortably to the wearer&#x27;s face shape and head movements. Elastic bands come in a pair of loops that can either be horizontally or vertically attached. Horizontal loops go around the head like tied straps, designed to exert tension on the top and bottom edges of the mask for firmer contact seal, and are usually seen on duckbill masks; while vertical loops hook around the ears with less tension (due to the weaker rigidity of the elastocartilaginous auricles compared to the bony skull) and thus less firmly secured to the face, but are more popular in non-procedural usages due to the ease of putting on and taking off.

Filter material in the middle layer may be made of microfibers with an electrostatic charge; that is, the fibers are electrets. An electret filter increases the chances that smaller particles will veer and hit a fiber, rather than going straight through (electrostatic capture). While there is some development work on making electret filtering materials that can stand being washed and reused, current commercially produced electret filters are ruined by many forms of disinfection, including washing with soap and water or alcohol, which destroys the electric charge. During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities issued guidelines on how to save, disinfect and reuse electret-filter masks without damaging the filtration efficiency. Standard disposible surgical masks are not designed to be washed.

=== Physical properties and quality ===
Performance of surgical masks is evaluated based on such parameters as filtration (mask capture of exhaled aerosols), exposure (transfer of aerosols from outside), mask airflow resistance (pressure difference during breathing, ΔP, also known as breathability), liquid penetration resistance, air and water vapor permeability, water repellency (for outer and inner surfaces).

Filtration and exposure is typically measured in bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) using particles of size 3.0 μm. Particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) using particles of size 0.3 μm is only measured in China.

== History ==

Face masks for use in surgery were developed in Europe by several physicians, including Jan Mikulicz-Radecki at the University of Breslau and Paul Berger in Paris, in the late nineteenth century, as a result of increasing awareness of germ theory and the importance of antiseptic procedures in medicine. In response to a pneumonic plague in Manchuria and Mongolia in 1910, Chinese-Malaysian epidemiologist Dr. Wu Lien-teh greatly improved on the designs he had seen in Europe to develop a face mask of layers of gauze and cotton that would protect both the wearer and others.

Modern surgical masks began to be used in the 1960s. Their adoption caused cloth facemasks, which had been used since the late 19th century, to completely fall out of use in the developed world. However, cloth masks and surgical masks both continued to be used in developing countries.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===


As the pandemic raged on, healthcare workers were required to continue wearing surgical masks for 12 or more hours a day. This caused the ear loops of the masks to chafe the back of their ears. Ear savers, plastic straps and hooks that go around wearer&#x27;s heads, were invented to move the ear loops away from the wearer&#x27;s ears. They could be made on demand by using 3D printing process.

== Use ==

===Healthcare workers===

A surgical mask is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery and certain health care procedures to catch microorganisms shed in liquid droplets and aerosols from the wearer&#x27;s mouth and nose. Evidence supports the effectiveness of surgical masks in reducing the risk of infection among other healthcare workers and in the community. However, a Cochrane review found that there is no clear evidence that disposable face masks worn by members of the surgical team would reduce the risk of wound infections after clean surgical procedures. However, the review cautioned that the studies examined are of low quality and that the result should not be generalized.

Healthcare workers are trained in how to put on, handle, remove, and dispose of surgical masks. For healthcare workers, safety guidelines recommend the wearing of a face-fit tested N95 or FFP3 respirator mask instead of a surgical mask in the vicinity of pandemic-flu patients, to reduce the exposure of the wearer to potentially infectious aerosols and airborne liquid droplets.

===General public===
In community and home settings, the use of facemasks and respirators generally are not recommended, with other measures preferred such as avoiding close contact, maintaining good hand hygiene, and wearing cloth face coverings.

In Japan and Taiwan, surgical masks have commonly been worn in winter months during the flu season by those who have respiratory illnesses as a courtesy intended to prevent viral transmission. Surgical masks provide some protection against the spread of diseases, and improvised masks provide about half as much protection. People in Japan as well as Korea and China may also wear masks in any season because of air pollution or allergies. Some younger Japanese people wear masks and audio headsets to signal a desire to avoid interaction. It has been suggested that mask-wearing as a custom appeared in East Asia rather than other parts of the world also facing pollution and disease due to the historical influence of Traditional Chinese Medicine and its ideas about air and wind.

More recently, due to the rising issue of smog in South and Southeast Asia, surgical masks and air filtering face masks are now frequently used in major cities in India, Nepal and Thailand when air quality deteriorates to toxic levels. Additionally, face masks are used in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore during the Southeast Asian haze season. Air filtering surgical-style masks are quite popular across Asia and as a result, many companies have released masks that not only prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles but are also fashionable. In Japan, some use masks as fashion statements, at times as a result of influence from K-pop stars.

Surgical masks may also be worn to conceal identity. In the United States banks, convenience stores, etc. have banned their use as a result of criminals repeatedly doing so, but allowed facemasks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, some protestors wore surgical masks amongst other types of mask to avoid recognition, and the government banned such use.

Research carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic found that surgical masks increase the attractiveness of the wearer and this is more so than other types of masks.

==Research and development==
Researchers are developing face-masks which may help reduce viral spread better than existing ones and/or have possibly useful properties such as biodegradability or better breathability. Some are exploring whether attachments could be added to existing face-masks to make them more effective such as due to virus-deactivating fabrics or impregnations.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41598-021-98577-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The COVID-19 pandemic increased efforts to develop such masks.

There also is an experimental face mask with an embedded biosensor that can detect a pathogenic signature (such as one of SARS-CoV-2) and face masks that glow under ultraviolet light if they contain SARS-CoV-2 when the filter is taken out and sprayed with a fluorescent dye that contains antibodies from ostrich eggs.

Other research investigated environmental pollution associated with face mask waste management and weak spots of masks with product designs of the widely applied FFP standards, in particular variants with exhalation valves.

==Regulation==

In the United States, surgical masks are cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the European Economic Area (EEA), surgical masks have to be certified through the CE marking process in order to be commercialized. CE marking of surgical masks involves the respect of many obligations indicated in the Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulation 2017/745 of 5 April 2017 concerning medical devices, OJ No L 117/1 of 2017-05-05).

Surgical masks for use in the US and the EEA conform to ASTM F2100 and EN 14683 respectively. In both standards, a mask must have a Bacterial Filtration Efficiency (BFE) of more than 95%, for an aerosol of particles of size approximately 3.0 μm.

In China, two types of masks are common: surgical masks that conform to YY 0469 standard (BFE ≥ 95%, PFE ≥ 30%, splash resistance) and single-use medical masks that conform to YY/T 0969 standard (BFE ≥ 95%). Daily protective masks conforming to GB/T 32610 standard is yet another type of masks that can have similar appearance to surgical masks.

== Sensorized Surgical Masks ==
In 2014, Firat Güder while he was a research fellow at Harvard University, together with Professor George Whitesides, invented a wireless surgical face mask that can monitor breathing of the individual wearing the mask. Their technology relied on disposal paper-based printed sensors which could be integrated into the mask. The technology, which was first published in 2016, led to the formation of a start-up (Spyras Ltd) company to commercialize it which was later acquired.

<text>Robert Elliott Storey Wyatt (2 May 1901 – 20 April 1995) was an English cricketer who played for Warwickshire, Worcestershire and England in a career lasting nearly thirty years from 1923 to 1951. He was born at Milford Heath House in Surrey and died at Treliske in Truro.

A determined batsman and handy medium pace bowler, Wyatt made his first-class cricket debut in 1923. He played his first Test match against South Africa in Johannesburg in 1927. He was controversially, by replacing Percy Chapman, appointed captain for England&#x27;s last Test against the dominant Australian touring team in 1930. He was unsuccessful and lost the role to Douglas Jardine for the next few years. Nevertheless, he was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1930.

Serving as Jardine&#x27;s vice-captain on the 1932–1933 tour of Australia, Wyatt was in charge of an early tour match that Jardine sat out of, and became the first captain to employ the controversial Bodyline tactic against Australia. After Jardine resigned following the political and administrative fallout caused by Bodyline, Wyatt was made captain again. He played in 40 test matches, fifteen as captain. He is said to have captained &quot;soundly if without inspiration&quot;.

Wyatt was noted for sustaining several injuries during his career but he had a &quot;bulldog spirit&quot;. Most famously, a ball bowled by West Indian bowler Manny Martindale hit him in the jaw during a match in Jamaica in 1935. He was carried unconscious from the field with his jaw broken in four places. When he regained consciousness in the dressing room, his first action was to signal for a pencil and paper – when these were supplied he wrote that he attached no blame to Martindale and amended his team&#x27;s batting order.

Wyatt played his last Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1937. In his test career, he scored 1,839 runs at an average of 31.70 and took 18 wickets at an average of 35.66. In his first-class career he played 739 matches, scoring 39,405 runs at an average of 40.04, and taking 901 wickets at an average of 32.84. His highest innings in a test match was 149 against South Africa at Trent Bridge in 1935.

He captained Warwickshire from 1930 to 1937 when he was replaced by Peter Cranmer. Wyatt didn&#x27;t like the way this was handled, but he nevertheless continued to play for Warwickshire through the 1938 and 1939 seasons. He served in the Royal Air Force in World War II. After the war, he transferred to Worcestershire, where he said he had six happy summers. In his penultimate match in 1951, he faced the final ball of the game against Somerset at Taunton with Worcestershire needing six to win, and &quot;he duly drove it high into the pavilion for victory&quot;.

He lived to be 93 years old and was England&#x27;s oldest living Test cricketer before his death. He has a stand named after him at Warwickshire&#x27;s home ground of Edgbaston. He was the cousin of politician and broadcaster Woodrow Wyatt.

<text>Cap and Skull is a co-educational senior honor society at Rutgers University in New Jersey. It was founded on January 18, 1900. Admission to Cap and Skull is dependent on excellence in academics, athletics, the arts, and public service. The organization considers leadership and character as factors for membership. Eighteen members are selected each year.

==History==
On January 18, 1900, ten members of the senior class of Rutgers College met in the Chi Psi lodge to form Cap and Skull. Drawing inspiration from Skull and Bones and Quill and Dagger, Yale and Cornell&#x27;s senior class honor societies, Cap and Skull aimed to form a similar honor society at Rutgers.

The ten founders drew up a constitution and adopted a code of secrecy and a motto. To ensure the exclusivity of the organization, the selection of a new member required a unanimous vote of the current members. In the first two decades, no more than 80 men joined the organization.

In the 1920s, the society began to reexamine its selection criteria to increase membership. Under the new system, each leadership position and honor on campus was awarded a point value, and students with the highest cumulative value were selected for induction. In 1923, in response to the growing student body, the number of members to be tapped each year was fixed at twelve and a tri-fold criterion for selection was established:
# Activities, athletic, and campus
# Scholarship
# Character and service to Rutgers
With the onset of World War II, many members of the Rutgers community left college to serve in the military. Only ten members were selected for Cap and Skull in 1944, and no one was tapped in 1945. In October 1945, members of the administration who were also Cap and Skull members were asked to make nominations for the class of 1946. 

Cap and Skull resumed the traditional twelve-member selection in 1948. On January 31, 1950, an all-day gala celebration was held in honor of Cap and Skull&#x27;s golden anniversary—the first of the ten-year reunions that are still held today. The golden anniversary celebrated the 440 men selected as members of the society during those first fifty years.

===Demise and rebirth===
Through the 1960s, sweeping social changes occurred and organizations such as Cap and Skull came under scrutiny. In 1969, Cap and Skull graduated its last class. Its alumni retained their ties and the underlying need for the organization remained. In 1981, Rutgers College students again discussed the need for an organization or honor that would recognize leadership contributions made by members of the senior class. Cap and Skull re-emerged in 1982, and a reunion was held to celebrate the tapping of new members.

In November 1990, the Cap and Skull Room was formally leased, solidifying Cap and Skull&#x27;s physical presence on campus. In 2000, a large gala event was held for the 100th anniversary of Cap and Skull and members endowed an annual scholarship to Rutgers students. Author William B. Brahms, a society member, compiled a detailed history with full biographies of all inducted members of the first 100 years. It was privately printed by the society, but is available at the Rutgers University Special Collections and Archives.

==Symbols==
The motto of Cap and Skull is &quot;Spectemur agendo&quot; or &quot;Let us be judged by our actions&quot;. Its pillars are Spirit, History, and Tradition.

==Membership==
Today, Cap and Skull represents many of the diverse organizations on campus and is now composed of undergraduate students from any of the university&#x27;s reorganized schools. Formerly only members of Rutgers College (which had become co-educational in 1972) and Rutgers College affiliates from the School of Pharmacy, Engineering, and Mason Gross School of the Arts were tapped.

Admission to Cap and Skull is dependent on excellence in academics, athletics, the arts, and public service. The organization considers leadership and character as factors for membership. Using these criteria, only eighteen new members are selected each year.

<doc id="821858" wikidata="Q709283" url="?curid=821858" title="Cksum">
<text>codice_1 is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that generates a checksum value for a file or stream of data. The cksum command reads each file given in its arguments, or standard input if no arguments are provided, and outputs the file&#x27;s 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum and byte count. The CRC output by cksum is different from the CRC-32 used in zip, PNG and zlib.

The codice_2 command can be used to verify that files transferred by unreliable means arrived intact. However, the CRC checksum calculated by the codice_2 command is not cryptographically secure: While it guards against &quot;accidental&quot; corruption (it is unlikely that the corrupted data will have the same checksum as the intended data), it is not difficult for an attacker to &quot;deliberately&quot; corrupt the file in a specific way that its checksum is unchanged. Unix-like systems typically include other commands for cryptographically secure checksums, such as sha256sum.

The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

Latest GNU Coreutils cksum provides additional checksum algorithms via -a option, as an extension beyond POSIX.

==Interoperability==
The standard codice_2 command, as found on most Unix and Unix-like operating systems (including Linux, *BSD, macOS, and Solaris) uses a CRC algorithm based on the ethernet standard frame check and is therefore interoperable between implementations. This is in contrast to the sum command, which is not as interoperable and not compatible with the CRC-32 calculation. On Tru64 operating systems, the codice_2 command returns a different CRC value, unless the environment variable codice_6 is set to codice_7.

==Algorithm==
codice_2 uses the generator polynomial 0x04C11DB7 and appends to the message its length in little endian representation. That length has null bytes trimmed on the right end.

==Syntax==

cksum [FILE]...
cksum [OPTION]
==Usage example==

$ cksum test.txt
4038471504 75 test.txt
where codice_9 represents the checksum value and codice_10 represents the file size of codice_11.

<text>Marguerite &quot;Margot&quot; Ruddock (1907–1951), who used the stage name Margot Collis, was an English actress, poet and singer. She had a relationship with W. B. Yeats starting in 1934. Their correspondence was published as &quot;Ah, Sweet Dancer&quot; (1970).

Yeats edited her poems for publication, but it is not clear how much change he made to them. He included some of them in the &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse&quot;, which he edited.

Some of her poems have been set as songs by the composer Robert Erickson.

She was married twice: first to John Collis, with whom she had a son, Michael, and secondly to Raymond Lovell, with whom she had a daughter, Simone Lovell. She died in 1951, when she was 44.

During her marriage to Raymond Lovell she had an affair with Yeats. When they met in 1934, Yeats was 69 and Ruddock`was 27. Their affair was conducted fitfully over the next few years. The affair broke down and Ruddock became mentally unstable. Some months later she followed Yeats (uninvited) out to the island of Majorca, where he was working with the Indian monk Shri Purohit Swami. Ruddock ended up in an asylum in Madrid from where she was rescued by Yeats and his friends, but later died in another institution, St. Ebba&#x27;s Hospital in Epsom. Yeats&#x27; poem &quot;A Crazed Girl&quot; is believed to be inspired by Ruddock.

<doc id="821869" wikidata="Q446998" url="?curid=821869" title="Chubb detector lock">
<text>A Chubb detector lock is a lever tumbler lock with an integral security feature, a re-locking device, which frustrates unauthorised access attempts and indicates to the lock&#x27;s owner that it has been interfered with. When someone tries to pick the lock or to open it using the wrong key, the lock is designed to jam in a locked state until (depending on the lock) either a special regulator key or the original key is inserted and turned in a different direction. This alerts the owner to the fact that the lock has been tampered with.

Any person who attempts to pick a detector lock must avoid triggering the automatic jamming mechanism. If the automatic jamming mechanism is accidentally triggered (which happens when any one of the levers is lifted too high) the lock-picker has the additional problem of resetting the detector mechanism before the next attempt to open the lock. This introduces additional complexity into the task, increasing the degree of lock-picking skill required to a level which few people have. The first detector lock was produced in 1818 by Jeremiah Chubb of Portsmouth, England, as the result of a government competition to create an unpickable lock. It remained unpicked until the Great Exhibition of 1851.

==Development==
In 1817, a burglary in Portsmouth Dockyard was carried out using false keys, prompting Her Majesty&#x27;s Government to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own unique key. In response, Jeremiah Chubb, who was working with his brother, Charles, as a ship&#x27;s outfitter and ironmonger in Portsmouth, invented and patented his detector lock in 1818. Building on earlier work by Robert Barron and Joseph Bramah, Jeremiah developed a four-lever lock that, when subjected to attempted picking, or use of the wrong key, would stop working until a special key was used to reset it. This security feature was known as a &quot;regulator&quot;, and was tripped when an individual lever was pushed past the position required to bring the lever in line to open the lock. This innovation was sufficient for Jeremiah to claim the £100 reward on offer ().

A locksmith who was a convict aboard one of the prison hulks in Portsmouth Docks was given the Chubb lock with a promise of a free pardon from the Government and £100 from Jeremiah if he could pick the lock. The convict, who had successfully picked every lock with which he had been presented, was confident he could do the same with the detector lock. After two or three months of trying he admitted defeat.

==Manufacture and improvements==
In 1820, Jeremiah joined his brother Charles in starting their own lock company, Chubb Locks. They moved from Portsmouth to Willenhall in Staffordshire, the lockmaking capital of Great Britain, and opened a factory in Temple Street. In 1836 they moved to St James&#x27; Square in the same town. A further move to the site of the old workhouse in Railway Street followed in 1838. The Chubb lock reportedly became popular as a result of the interest generated when King George IV accidentally sat on a Chubb lock that still had the key inserted.

A number of improvements were made to the original design but the basic principle behind its construction remained unchanged. In 1824, Charles patented an improved design that no longer required a special regulator key to reset the lock. The original lock used four levers, but by 1847 work by Jeremiah, Charles, his son John and others resulted in a six-lever version. A later innovation was the &quot;curtain&quot;, a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock. In due course Chubb began to manufacture brass padlocks incorporating the &quot;detector&quot; mechanism.

==Picking==

Competition in the lock business was fierce and there were various challenges issued in an attempt to prove the superiority of one type of lock over another. Joseph Bramah exhibited one of his locks in the window of his shop and offered 200 guineas (£210 and ) to anybody who could devise a method of picking it. In 1832, a Mr Hart, replying to a challenge by Chubb, failed to pick one of his detector locks. After a number of people tried and failed, the first person to pick the six-lever Chubb lock was the American locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs, the inventor of the protector lock, during the Great Exhibition in 1851.

==In popular culture==
Chubb locks are mentioned twice in the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. In the short story &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, Holmes describes a house with a &quot;Chubb lock to the door.&quot; In another short story, &quot;The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez&quot;, Holmes asks &quot;Is it a simple key?&quot; to which Mrs Marker, an elderly maid, replies, &quot;No, sir, it is a Chubb&#x27;s key.&quot; In both of these stories, the description makes clear that the lock could not have been picked, a minor clue in solving each mystery. In R. Austin Freeman&#x27;s &quot;The Penrose Mystery&quot;, Dr. Thorndyke says: “Burglars don’t try to pick Chubb locks.”

A Chubb lock is featured in the novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; by William Gibson.

Sarah MacLean&#x27;s novel &quot;Wicked and the Wallflower&quot;, set in 1837, has a Chubb lock on the door of the Bareknuckles Bastard&#x27;s smuggling warehouse. Lady Felicity Faircloth cannot pick it on her first attempt.

<text>George Dance the Elder (1695 – 8 February 1768) was a British architect. He was the City of London surveyor and architect from 1735 until his death.

==Life==
Originally a mason, George Dance was appointed Clerk of the city works to the City of London. In 1734, shortly before taking up the post, he had won a major commission from the city, for the Mansion House, the new residence for the Lord Mayor. He was one of three architects—the others being James Gibbs and Giacomo Leoni—who had been invited to submit designs. His building has a grand portico, and an &quot;Egyptian Hall&quot;, so called because it uses an arrangement of columns described as Egyptian by Vitruvius. It was completed in 1752.

He also designed the Great Synagogue of London as well as the churches of St Leonard&#x27;s, Shoreditch (1736–40), St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate (1741–44) and St Matthew&#x27;s, Bethnal Green (1743–46). Further afield, Dance designed the Town Hall of Coleraine in Northern Ireland (1743; demolished in 1859).

Sir John Summerson included Dance in a list of London architects who he felt debased Palladianism, calling his Mansion House &quot;cramped and overdressed&quot;.

George had five sons, three of whom enjoyed fame in their own right. 
* Eldest son James Dance (1722–1744) became an actor and playwright connected with Drury Lane theatre, and took the name Love.
* Second son Giles
* Third son Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland (1735–1811) was a notable painter. 
* Fourth son William, &quot;an ingenious modest man, is in a private situation. With a talent for musick, &amp; much ingenuity He has attempted to get a living by miniature painting &amp; by teaching as a School Master. Lord Camden knows him &amp;, being at a Concert given by his Brother Sir Nathaniel, conceived the reason to be his situation in life. His Lordship soon after had a Concert &amp; invited Sir Nathaniel &amp; William who made an excuse, which His Lordship saw through &amp; put off the day of his Concert. William was obliged to attend to the 2nd invitation &amp; gave Lord C. an opportunity of showing an attention that the Brother had not.&quot;
* Fifth son George Dance the Younger (1741–1825) succeeded him as city architect. 

Dance is buried in the churchyard of St Luke&#x27;s Old Street, north of the City of London.

<text>Louis-Isidore Duperrey (21 October 1786 – 25 August 1865) was a French naval officer and explorer.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Louis-Isidore Duperrey was born in 1786.

===Career===
He joined the navy in 1802, and served as marine hydrologist to Louis Claude de Saulces de Freycinet aboard the &quot;Uranie&quot; (1817–1820). He commanded &quot;La Coquille&quot; on its circumnavigation of the earth (1822–1825) with Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville as second. René-Primevère Lesson also travelled on &quot;La Coquille&quot; as a naval doctor and naturalist. On the return to France in March 1825, Lesson and Dumont brought back to France an imposing collection of animals and plants collected on the Falkland Islands, on the coasts of Chile and Peru, in the archipelagos of the Pacific and New Zealand, New Guinea and Australia.

During the voyage the ship spend two weeks in the Bay of Islands in the north of New Zealand in 1824 and visited for ten days on l&#x27;île d&#x27;Oualan, now Kosrae, contemporary Federated States of Micronesia, that same year. On the return voyage to France the ship sailed through the Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu).

He was the first to put together on a map the whole Gilbert Islands archipelago, which are now part of Kiribati (with the name given to it by Admiral Krusenstern). He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1861.

===Death===
He died in 1865.

==Legacy==
The Australian eastern three-lined skink, &quot;Bassiana duperreyi&quot; (Gray, 1838), was named in his honour.

Also 2 plant genera have been named in his honour, &quot;Duperrea&quot; (in 1924 ), and &quot;Duperreya&quot; from Australia (in 1829 ).

<doc id="821876" wikidata="Q163974" url="?curid=821876" title="Rafael van der Vaart">
<text>Rafael Ferdinand van der Vaart (born 11 February 1983) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

Van der Vaart began his career at Ajax&#x27;s youth academy and worked his way into the first team, debuting as a 17-year-old. Known for his playmaking skills, he drew comparisons to Johan Cruyff. He was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year and became the first recipient of the Golden Boy Award while at the club. He moved to Bundesliga club Hamburger SV, then to Real Madrid, then on to Tottenham Hotspur before returning to Hamburger SV in 2012. In the latter stages of his career, Van der Vaart had brief spells playing in Spain and Denmark before announcing his retirement in 2018, and return in 2019 with a testimonial match.

Van der Vaart earned 109 caps for the Netherlands between 2001 and 2013. He represented the country at three UEFA European Championships and two FIFA World Cups, reaching the final in 2010.

In 2019, Van der Vaart began his darts career, joining the British Darts Organisation.

==Early life==
Van der Vaart was born in Heemskerk, North Holland, to a Dutch father and a Spanish mother from Chiclana de la Frontera, Cádiz, who had moved to the Netherlands weeks after birth. He grew up on a trailer park, belonging to a Dutch cultural minority called the Woonwagenbewoners, who had ties to the Irish Travellers and the Yenish people, and he often pretended to be Romário while playing football. It was at the trailer park that he learned how to play football and, before joining Ajax, he played for a local club called De Kennemers based in Beverwijk. At the age of ten, he joined the Ajax Academy. Van der Vaart has said of his upbringing: &quot;That was the way my family lived. My father was born there and it is a lifestyle. Maybe it is not a normal lifestyle but I always liked it. I always played football on the street. It was an easy life, then I was 10 years old and went to Ajax and played there for almost 12 years.&quot;

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Van der Vaart came through the ranks at Ajax with national teammates John Heitinga and Wesley Sneijder. Initially, he signed for Ajax on a trial basis as a ten-year-old, but was eventually enrolled permanently after impressing the coaches. At the age of 17, Van der Vaart made his debut for the Ajax senior side in a 1–1 draw with Den Bosch on 19 April 2000 in the 1999–00 season. After he broke into the Ajax first team, Van der Vaart was &quot;hailed as the new Johan Cruyff&quot;.
In the 2000–01 season, Ajax manager Co Adriaanse increased Van der Vaart&#x27;s playing time by moving him to the attacking midfielder position. He was voted European Talent of the Year by Italian football website CalcioManager.

The next season, Van der Vaart suffered a serious knee injury against RKC Waalwijk on 10 February 2002 which required an operation that involved the removal of his entire meniscus. This injury forced him to miss the run-in to Ajax&#x27;s successful Eredivisie campaign and their Dutch Cup triumph against Utrecht in the 2001–02 season, but it did not stop him being named the Netherlands&#x27; Talent of the Year, mainly thanks to the 15 goals in just 27 games that he scored before the incident.

In 2002–03, Ajax won the Amsterdam Tournament, though injury limited Van der Vaart to 21 league appearances, in which he scored 18 goals. After his return to fitness, he scored a vital goal in the UEFA Champions League away to Lyon, which propelled Ajax into the knockout stages.

In the first half of 2003–04, his performances were poor. Van der Vaart admitted he was overweight, and the media criticized his celebrity lifestyle with his then-fiancée, &quot;The Music Factory&quot; VJ Sylvie Meis. He became an influential figure once again as Ajax claimed another league title. By that stage, Van der Vaart had firmly established himself as one of the stars of the Ajax team, as well as one of the most popular players in the Netherlands.

Van der Vaart was named team captain by coach Ronald Koeman for the 2004–05 season. During an international match against Sweden on 18 August 2004, he was injured by then-Ajax teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović, which led to the sale of Ibrahimović to Juventus two weeks later, following controversial accusations that the Swede had intentionally tried to hurt Van der Vaart. He was unhappy at being played out of position, and following his refusal to play on the wing in a Champions League match in December, he was stripped of the team captaincy by Koeman.

His ongoing injury problems that resulted in an average of only 23 league appearances in five seasons with Ajax, led him to announce that he was leaving the club at the end of the year.

===Hamburger SV===
At this point, Van der Vaart&#x27;s performances were attracting interest from some of Europe&#x27;s top clubs. He had previously been strongly linked to Milan, but in the summer of 2005, he signed for Bundesliga outfit Hamburger SV in Germany. Van der Vaart&#x27;s €5.5 million transfer to Hamburg, on 1 June 2005, raised many eyebrows. Many other top-flight clubs had shown interest in the midfielder but he chose Hamburg. Ajax legend Johan Cruyff himself commented in his &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; column: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to say about it or what Rafael van der Vaart is doing in Hamburg.&quot; He played a massive part in Hamburg&#x27;s impressive away form that season, scoring in each of their first four games on the road; in fact, in the course of his first one and a half seasons with the German club, they did not lose a single match away from home while he was on the pitch. Van der Vaart finished his first season as the team&#x27;s top scorer as Hamburg finished third in the league and won the 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

He assumed the team captaincy for the 2006–07 season. This season proved to be a difficult one for his club, and despite Van der Vaart&#x27;s three goals in the Champions League group stages, they made an early exit from the competition, while languishing for several months in the bottom half of the Bundesliga table as Van der Vaart was troubled by injuries throughout the season. The arrival of Van der Vaart&#x27;s countryman Huub Stevens as head coach, however, saw Hamburg march up the standings and they finished the season in a respectable seventh place, qualifying for, and also winning, the Intertoto Cup.

After garnering interest from Real Madrid from Spain, Van der Vaart responded by saying, &quot;I am set to spend another season in Hamburg,&quot; of which he told &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;. He further added, &quot;Now we have the team to achieve something.&quot; In the 2007–08 season, Van der Vaart scored 12 league goals as Hamburg finished fourth in the league, while reaching the round of 16 in the UEFA Cup. During the UEFA Cup away win at FC Zürich, he tore ankle ligaments and was out of action for several weeks. Despite interest from other clubs such as Chelsea and Valencia, he stated that he would stay at Hamburg until the end of the season, but opted out of signing a contract extension.

===Real Madrid===
Towards the end of the 2007–08 season, Van der Vaart was linked to a move to several clubs including Atlético Madrid and Juventus. Atlético made a €15 million bid for the Dutchman, which Hamburg rejected, and in the end, it was their cross-town rivals who got Van der Vaart&#x27;s signature instead.

On 4 August 2008, Real Madrid and Hamburg reached a €13 million agreement for Van der Vaart&#x27;s transfer, Real Madrid&#x27;s only summer signing. He signed a five-year contract for an undisclosed amount. Van der Vaart debuted in a 2–1 pre-season win four days later, against Colombian side Independiente, where he scored the equalising goal and provided an assist for the winner.

He changed his squad number from 19 to his favoured number 23 after teammate Wesley Sneijder took number 10 following Robinho&#x27;s departure to Manchester City on 31 August. He marked his league debut for Real Madrid with a strike against Numancia in a 4–3 victory. On 24 September, he scored his first career hat-trick in a 7–1 thrashing of Sporting de Gijón. In October
2008, Van der Vaart was one of the many La Liga players to be nominated for the Ballon d&#x27;Or, but the award eventually went to Manchester United forward and future teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. For the latter part of the 2008–09 season, Van der Vaart was mostly utilised as an impact substitute by coach Juande Ramos, which led to speculations of a fall-out between coach and player. Despite transfer rumours linking him with Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool, he denied having any links with the English clubs.

During the summer of 2009, it was speculated that van der Vaart would leave Real Madrid after being told he was not going to be part of the team&#x27;s plans by coach Manuel Pellegrini. His number 23 jersey was even handed to Esteban Granero in preseason, leaving him without a squad number. Towards the end of the summer transfer window, however, he eventually came to an agreement with Real Madrid to stay with the club after the squad size had been reduced to 25 players as Dutch compatriots Sneijder, Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar were forced to leave the club. Van der Vaart was handed his original number 23 jersey while Granero was given number 24. After a wait of four games, Van der Vaart was finally included in Pellegrini&#x27;s squad list to face Villarreal on 23 September. An injury to Kaká gave Van der Vaart a chance to establish himself as a key player for Real Madrid again. On 20 December, he scored two goals in a 6–0 win against Real Zaragoza. He scored his last goal for Real Madrid against Málaga on 16 May 2010. Van der Vaart stated his desire to stay at Real Madrid, at least until the end of his contract.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 31 August 2010, two hours before the transfer window closed, Tottenham Hotspur made an offer of £8 million for Van der Vaart. According to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, an £18 million transfer to Bayern Munich had collapsed the day before and Van der Vaart had suddenly become much cheaper, although such a price reduction was later denied by Real Madrid. Due to problems with computer servers used in the transaction between Tottenham and Real Madrid, preventing the necessary paperwork from being completed, Spurs requested special dispensation from the Premier League to allow the transfer to proceed. The Premier League confirmed on 1 September that the transfer had been permitted after they gave Tottenham special dispensation due to &quot;technical problems&quot;. He signed a four-year contract at White Hart Lane. It was announced that Van der Vaart would wear the number 11 shirt for Spurs. Van der Vaart later denied speculation that he had been a failure at Real Madrid, stating that he always gave his best over the last few years for both club and country, and that he wanted to show his quality for his new club.
Van der Vaart made his Premier League debut for Spurs in a 1–1 draw against West Bromwich Albion on 11 September 2010, and his Champions League bow for the club three days later against Werder Bremen, providing an assist for Peter Crouch in a 2–2 draw. Van der Vaart scored his first Premier League goal from the penalty spot in a 3–1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 18 September. After starting his Spurs career by scoring three goals in four Premier League matches, and with a goal and an assist in two Champions League matches, Van der Vaart was named Goal.com World Player of the Week on 4 October 2010. He was later named Premier League Player of the Month for October.

A hamstring injury kept Van der Vaart out of action for much of December, but he returned to the Tottenham side on 26 December, scoring both goals in a 2–1 away win over Aston Villa. On 20 April 2011, Van der Vaart revived Tottenham&#x27;s Champions League ambitions by scoring twice to hold North London rivals Arsenal to a 3–3 draw at White Hart Lane. After losing to Manchester City and being knocked out of the Champions League race, Spurs travelled to Anfield. Van der Vaart scored from 25 yards out in a 2–0 win that put Tottenham in position to secure qualification for the Europa League. He ended the season as Spurs&#x27; top scorer in the Premier League, scoring 13 goals – nearly a quarter of Tottenham&#x27;s total – while also providing the most assists, with nine.

Van der Vaart scored his first two Premier League goals of the following season against Wigan Athletic and Arsenal.
Van der Vaart scored a penalty away against Newcastle United on 16 October to keep up a good run of goal scoring form and also scored twice in the 2–1 win over Blackburn Rovers. On 30 October, scored in a 3–1 win over Queens Park Rangers, equalling a Tottenham record by scoring in five consecutive Premier League matches, a record he shares with Teddy Sheringham and Robbie Keane. On 31 December, he scored away to Swansea City, converting a Benoît Assou-Ekotto cross. Van der Vaart scored a long-range effort against Watford in the FA Cup to send Tottenham through to the next round of the competition with a 1–0 victory. He was on the pitch at White Hart Lane on 17 March 2012 when Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba went into cardiac arrest; Van der Vaart later described it as &quot;horrible to witness ... the absolute low in my football career&quot;. 

===Return to Hamburg===

On 31 August 2012, Van der Vaart returned to his former club, Hamburger SV. He would wear his favourite 23 number on the shirt and was announced as club&#x27;s vice-captain. On 16 September, he made his second debut with HSV in a match against Eintracht Frankfurt. On 22 September, Van der Vaart provided two assists against Borussia Dortmund, contributing to two crucial goals in a 3–2 win. He scored his first goal of the season in a 2–2 away draw against Borussia Mönchengladbach, later suffering a serious injury that left him out of action for several months.

Van der Vaart made his return to action on 20 January 2013 against Nürnberg in a 1–1 draw. On 9 April, he was named the club&#x27;s captain, succeeding Heiko Westermann. Not having scored for almost two months, Van der Vaart scored a brace on 20 April 2013 against Fortuna Düsseldorf in a 2–1 home win. Hamburg later decided not to give van der Vaart a contract extension.

===Real Betis===
Van der Vaart joined newly promoted Spanish club Real Betis on a free transfer in June 2015. He made his debut for the club on 24 September in a 2–1 La Liga defeat to Deportivo. His performance turned out to be a fiasco. He finally left the club on 30 June 2016, accumulating just 296 minutes of playing time in the 2015–2016 season.

===FC Midtjylland===
On 31 July 2016, Van der Vaart was spotted in a skybox at MCH Arena just outside Herning alongside agents Alan Hvedehave and Mikkel Beckmann, both before and during the league game between Danish Superliga clubs FC Midtjylland and Silkeborg. Following the match, in a live interview with Danish Eurosport 2, Midtjylland sporting director Claus Steinlein denied any ongoing negotiations, stating that Midtjylland would not be able to live up to Van der Vaart&#x27;s economic demands. Just four days later, however, ahead of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League third round qualifying match against Videoton, Steinlein confirmed that the club was in fact trying to work out a deal with him.

On 10 August, Van der Vaart joined Midtjylland on a two-year deal. Eighteen days later, he made his Superliga debut, as a substitute for Paul Onuachu in a 0–0 draw away to local rivals Viborg. Less than a month later, in his fourth appearance for his new side, he scored his first goal in a 5–2 win at home against promoted team Horsens. After coming in as a substitute in a match against Lyngby on 28 May 2017 he was selected for only one of the first team&#x27;s matches until 9 February 2018 where he was on the bench in a 2–0 win against Horsens. On 18 February 2018 Van der Vaart made his first appearance for the first team in the 2017–18 season coming in as a substitute in the 90th minute. He told NOS, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t selected for half a year. That&#x27;s why this is a celebration for me. Not playing is awful.&quot;

=== Esbjerg ===
On 4 August 2018 it was made public that Van der Vaart had signed a one-year contract with Esbjerg in the same league. He had been training with them since his FC Midtjylland had ended. He was presented to the fans at the Esbjerg Stadium before a league game against Randers, which ended in a 3–3 draw. On 4 November, having been struggling with recurring injuries, he announced he would retire from professional football with immediate effect.

On 22 August 2019 Van der Vaart confirmed, that he would play a game for Esbjerg&#x27;s reserves in the ninth tier of football in Denmark. Due to his relationship with handball player Estavana Polman, he was still living in Esbjerg, as she was playing for Team Esbjerg.

==International career==

Van der Vaart gained the notice of the youth team coaches and was called up for the youth squads. He played in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship with present senior teammates Maarten Stekelenburg and John Heitinga and former Real Madrid teammates Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Arjen Robben.

The 18-year-old Van der Vaart then made his senior international debut against Andorra on 6 October 2001. He was a member of the squads that participated in Euro 2004, Euro 2008, Euro 2012, the 2006 World Cup and the 2010 World Cup. Despite figuring prominently in a number of qualifying stage matches, Van der Vaart has had a lack of luck when it came to the final tournament. He was however, vice-captain during the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 behind Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Mark van Bommel respectively. On 15 August 2012, Van der Vaart earned his 100th cap for the Netherlands in the 2–4 loss against Belgium in a friendly match.

Van der Vaart was used to wear the number 23 or 10 jersey while playing for his country.

===Euro 2004===
A sub-par performance by the Dutch during their opening game of Euro 2004 persuaded then manager Dick Advocaat to change the side&#x27;s formation into one which he felt the talented Van der Vaart did not fit into. With Advocaat&#x27;s new system seemingly working, Van der Vaart would be reduced to play a bit-part role at Euro 2004, as &quot;Oranje&quot; reached the semi-finals before losing to hosts Portugal.

===2006 World Cup===
Despite that setback, Van der Vaart produced some superlative performances in the Bundesliga the following season, and it seemed that Van der Vaart&#x27;s turn to shine on the big stage was to finally come – at the 2006 World Cup. However, niggling injury problems resurfaced, and Van der Vaart was not risked by Dutch coach Marco van Basten for the opening World Cup encounter against Serbia and Montenegro. With victory in that opening game, the national team coach would once again decide to continue fielding a &quot;Van der Vaart-less&quot; lineup. And once again, Van der Vaart was reduced to a bit-part role in the squad as they exited the competition in the round of 16 against Portugal.

===Euro 2008===

Van der Vaart was called up for Euro 2008 despite missing several qualification matches due to an ankle injury. As Van Basten had decided to change their formation to 4–2–3–1, Van der Vaart was deployed in the midfield along with Wesley Sneijder and either Dirk Kuyt or Robin van Persie, behind lone striker Ruud van Nistelrooy to great effect. In the opening game of the competition, the Dutch team won 3–0 against the world champions Italy with Van der Vaart playing a role in the build-ups. Van Basten decided to field him again in the starting line-up in the next match against France; the &quot;Oranje&quot; later went on to win 4–1. Despite an impressive group stage performance, the Dutch suffered a disappointing quarter-final exit at the hands of Russia.

===2010 World Cup===
Despite enduring a tough time at club level, Van der Vaart remained a first-choice player for Van Basten&#x27;s successor Bert van Marwijk in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. On 10 September 2008, he ended a ten-month goal drought with a vital strike against Macedonia in a 2–1 win. He ended the campaign with 2 goals and several important assists.

On 12 August 2009, Van der Vaart captained the Dutch in the absence of Giovanni van Bronckhorst in a friendly against England. He scored the second goal off a Gareth Barry mistake to put the Netherlands two goals up in the first half but Jermain Defoe netted a brace to seal a 2–2 draw.
Van der Vaart was in the starting line-up for the three group matches in the 2010 World Cup, against Denmark, Japan and Cameroon, but eventually lost his spot in the starting line-up to his recently recovered fellow midfielder Arjen Robben after being substituted in the match against Cameroon. He was brought off the pitch after giving away a penalty to Cameroon by blocking the ball with his arm from a free-kick. However, he made another appearance in the semi-final against Uruguay, after coming on for the injured Demy de Zeeuw. He helped &quot;Oranje&quot; win the match 3–2, thus sending them to the final. He also played in the final against Spain, substituting Nigel de Jong just before injury time. Netherlands lost the game 1–0 to a goal from Andrés Iniesta. He was handed the captain&#x27;s armband during the match, after Giovanni van Bronckhorst was substituted off.

===Euro 2012===
Van der Vaart made his Euro 2012 debut as a sub in the first match against Denmark – a match they went on to lose. In the second match against Germany, again he was a substitute, but came on for Dutch captain Mark van Bommel and took the captain&#x27;s armband. In the second half he created more attacking chances, which led to a goal, but they again lost the match. In the final group match against Portugal, Van der Vaart started as captain, and scored a goal that gave the Netherlands a glimmer of hope to get out of the group. However, two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo gave Portugal a 2–1 win and knocked out the Netherlands.

===2014 World Cup===
Van der Vaart was named in Louis van Gaal&#x27;s provisional 30-man squad for the 2014 World Cup, but withdrew on 28 May, three days before the final squad was named, due to a calf injury that he suffered in training.

==Personal life==
On 10 June 2005, Van der Vaart married Sylvie Meis and on 28 May 2006, their son Damián Rafael was born. Some of the media have described the couple as the &quot;new Beckhams&quot; but both of them denied the claims saying that they prefer to just live a normal life.

In the summer of 2009, Real Madrid wanted to sell Van der Vaart, but the player decided to stay in Madrid because his wife was undergoing cancer treatment there. A year later, upon his move to England, Van der Vaart stated, &quot;She had a very serious illness and it is true that she had to be treated at the Clinica Quiron. Last season, they wanted me to leave but I couldn&#x27;t leave for that reason. Now she is well and the only thing that happened was that Madrid wanted to sell and I wanted to get back to enjoying playing football, and Tottenham are a great team that are going to give me the football opportunities that I need.&quot;

In 2010, Van der Vaart found out through emails that his wife was having an affair with a KLM airline pilot. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2012, Van der Vaart and his wife separated. Their son Damián signed for the youth team of Ajax in September 2023.

Since August 2016, Van der Vaart has been in a relationship with Dutch handball player Estavana Polman who played for Danish club Team Esbjerg. This was the main reason he moved to Denmark and chose to play for Midtjylland. On 27 December 2016, they announced that they were expecting a child. Their daughter Jesslynn was born in June 2017.

==Coaching career==
On 10 August 2021, Van der Vaart was hired in his first coaching role as an assistant coach to Peter Hyballa at his former club Esbjerg. Van der Vaart had lived in Esbjerg for the past five years due to his relationship with handball player Estavana Polman, who was playing for Team Esbjerg. On 27 January 2023 the club confirmed, that Van der Vaart&#x27;s contract had been terminated by mutual agreement. 

==Darts career==
In April 2019, Van der Vaart began a professional darts career, joining the British Darts Organisation. On 4 May, Van der Vaart made his debut at the Denmark Open, winning his first round match 4–2 against Thomas Anderson before being knocked out in the second round 4–0 by Mogens Christensen.

<text>An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) or transformer coupled plasma (TCP) is a type of plasma source in which the energy is supplied by electric currents which are produced by electromagnetic induction, that is, by time-varying magnetic fields.

==Operation==

There are three types of ICP geometries: planar (Fig. 3 (a)), cylindrical (Fig. 3 (b)), and half-toroidal (Fig. 3 (c)).

In planar geometry, the electrode is a length of flat metal wound like a spiral (or coil). In cylindrical geometry, it is like a helical spring. In half-toroidal geometry, it is a toroidal solenoid cut along its main diameter to two equal halves.

When a time-varying electric current is passed through the coil, it creates a time-varying magnetic field around it, with flux

formula_1,

where &quot;r&quot; is the distance to the center of coil (and of the quartz tube).

According to the Faraday–Lenz&#x27;s law of induction, this creates azimuthal electromotive force in the rarefied gas:

formula_2,

which corresponds to electric field strengths of

formula_3,

leading to the formation of the electron trajectories providing a plasma generation. The dependence on &quot;r&quot; suggests that the gas ion motion is most intense in the outer region of the flame, where the temperature is the greatest. In the real torch, the flame is cooled by the cooling gas from the outside , so the hottest outer part is at thermal equilibrium. Temperature there reaches 5 000 – 6 000 K. For more rigorous description, see Hamilton–Jacobi equation in electromagnetic fields.

The frequency of alternating current used in the RLC circuit which contains the coil is usually 27–41 MHz. To induce plasma, a spark is produced at the electrodes at the gas outlet. Argon is one example of a commonly used rarefied gas. The high temperature of the plasma allows the atomization of molecules and thus determination of many elements, and in addition, for about 60 elements the degree of ionization in the torch exceeds 90%. The ICP torch consumes c. 1250–1550 W of power, and this depends on the element composition of the sample (due to different ionization energies).

The ICPs have two operation modes, called capacitive (E) mode with low plasma density and inductive (H) mode with high plasma density. Transition from E to H heating mode occurs with external inputs.

== Applications ==
Plasma electron temperatures can range between ~6,000 K and ~10,000 K and are usually several orders of magnitude greater than the temperature of the neutral species. Temperatures of argon ICP plasma discharge are typically ~5,500 to 6,500 K and are therefore comparable to those reached at the surface (photosphere) of the sun (~4,500 K to ~6,000 K). ICP discharges are of relatively high electron density, on the order of 1015 cm−3. As a result, ICP discharges have wide applications wherever a high-density plasma (HDP) is needed.

* ICP-AES/ICP-OES, a type of atomic emission spectroscopy.
* ICP-MS, a type of mass spectrometry.
* ICP-RIE, a type of reactive-ion etching.

Another benefit of ICP discharges is that they are relatively free of contamination, because the electrodes are completely outside the reaction chamber. By contrast, in a capacitively coupled plasma (CCP), the electrodes are often placed inside the reactor chamber and are thus exposed to the plasma and to subsequent reactive chemical species.

<text>Bold Venture was a syndicated radio series starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall that aired from 1951 to 1952. Morton Fine and David Friedkin scripted the taped series for Bogart&#x27;s Santana Productions.

== Synopsis ==

Salty seadog Slate Shannon (Bogart) owns a Cuban hotel, Shannon&#x27;s Place, sheltering an assortment of treasure hunters, revolutionaries, and other shady characters. With his sidekick and ward, the sultry Sailor Duval (Bacall), tagging along, he encounters modern-day pirates and other tough situations while navigating the waters around Havana. Aboard his boat, the &quot;Bold Venture&quot;, Slate and Sailor experience &quot;adventure, intrigue, mystery and romance in the sultry settings of tropical Havana and the mysterious islands of the Caribbean.&quot;

Calypso singer King Moses (Jester Hairston) provided musical bridges by threading plot situations into the lyrics of his songs. Music for the series was by David Rose.

The series combined elements of a number of past Bogart/Bacall film collaborations, most notably &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; which also cast Bogart as a boat owner in the Caribbean who reluctantly becomes involved in intrigue while romancing Bacall. The relationship between Shannon and King Moses, and his ownership of an inn, is strongly reminiscent of the dynamic between Rick Blaine and Sam in &quot;Casablanca&quot;.

== Production ==

Beginning in March 1951, the Frederic W. Ziv Company syndicated 78 episodes via electrical transcription. Heard on 423 stations, the 30-minute series earned $5,000 weekly for Bogart and Bacall.

All of Frederic Ziv&#x27;s 40+ radio series (some 10,000 radio programs), including all 78 episodes of &quot;Bold Venture&quot;, were donated by the Ziv Estate to Media Heritage and exclusively licensed to Carl Amari who successfully launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds necessary to professionally transfer the complete run of &quot;Bold Venture&quot;. Soon, all 78 episodes will be available, including 18 &quot;lost&quot; &quot;Bold Venture&quot; episodes which have not been heard in more than 70 years. A definitive collection of all 78 &quot;Bold Venture&quot; episodes, which will include a detailed historical booklet, will be available beginning in 2024 through Amari&#x27;s company. Amari plans to launch additional Kickstarter campaigns to raise funds necessary to release more complete runs of Ziv radio series, including &quot;Boston Blackie&quot;, &quot;I Was a Communist for the FBI&quot;, &quot;Favorite Story&quot;, &quot;Philo Vance&quot; and &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;.

<text>Fermín Cacho Ruiz (born 16 February 1969) is a Spanish track and field athlete, winner of the gold medal in the 1500m at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the silver medal in the 1500m at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

Born in Ágreda, Spain, Cacho had an enviable competitive record in the 1500 m, but it was not until late in his career that he produced a time of corresponding quality.

Cacho&#x27;s first notable result came in 1990, when he finished second in the 1500 m at the European Indoor Championships in Glasgow. At the 1991 World Indoor Championships in Seville, Cacho finished again second in the 1500 m, behind Noureddine Morceli.

At the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Cacho was not considered a serious gold medal prospect. But the Olympic 1500 m final was run at a very pedestrian pace, and Cacho positioned himself perfectly in the final lap, and outsprinted his rivals, with a last lap of 50.6 seconds, to win the gold medal in 3:40.12.

In 1993 at Stuttgart in World Championships, Cacho finished second, but took the 1500 m title at the European Championships in Helsinki in the next year. In World Championships at Gothenburg, Cacho only finished in eighth place.

After a relatively lean year in 1995, Cacho was back to his best in the early part of the 1996 season, leading up to the Olympic Games in Atlanta. Although Cacho was the defending Olympic 1500 m champion, the final in Atlanta was considered to be a match race between Morceli and Hicham El Guerrouj, who had filled the first two places at the previous year&#x27;s World Championships. Approaching the completion of the third lap, Morceli was leading from El Guerrouj, when suddenly the Moroccan tripped and fell. In taking evasive action, Cacho was forced to leap over the fallen El Guerrouj, in a manoeuvre which he later estimated had lost him 5 metres of ground to Morceli, who had commenced his final lap sprint for the finish. Cacho chased Morceli around the last lap, but was unable to catch him. In the end Morceli won by 5 metres from the second-placed Cacho.

At the World Championships in Athens in 1997, Cacho won a silver medal again, and at the end of the same season he finally managed to run his world class time, when he finished second at the 1500 m behind El Guerrouj with a time of 3:28.95, which moved him to third on the all-time world list behind Morceli and El Guerrouj. He won the bronze medal at the 1998 European Championships in Budapest, and finished fourth in the World Championships at Seville in 1999. Cacho suffered an Achilles&#x27; tendon injury in 2000, causing him to miss the opportunity to add to his Olympic gold and silver medals at 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

He held the European record at 1500 m with a time of 3:28.95 for 16 years (1997–2013), until Mo Farah broke it with a time of 3:28.81.

<text>Arthur Shearly Cripps (10 June 1869 – 1 August 1952) was an English-born Anglican priest, missionary, activist, short story writer, and poet who spent most of his life in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).

==Biography==

Cripps was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Oxford, where he read history. He then trained for the Anglican priesthood at Cuddesdon Theological College, coming under the influence of Charles Gore. From 1894 he held the parish Ford End in Essex.

A friend of Frank Weston, the leading Anglo Catholic priest who would become Bishop of Zanzibar he became a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, intending to work in Mashonaland, after reading criticism of the methods of Cecil Rhodes. From 1902 he had a parish near Enkeldoorn (now known as Chivhu) in what was then Southern Rhodesia.

He was in conflict with the British South Africa Company over land distribution, taking the side of the African population. He was given the Shona name &quot;Mpandi&quot;, or &#x27;the man who walks like thunder&#x27;. After more than 20 years he returned to England for a time after a quarrel with the British administration; but went back shortly afterwards for the rest of his life, having in 1927 published &quot;Africa for Africans&quot;, on the land issue.

Arthur Cripps lived for some time in Manyene Communal Lands, about 120 km South of Harare, 20 km North of Chivhu. An area of Manyene is now known by the name he gave it when he established the mission work there, Maronda Mashanu, which means &quot;The Five Wounds&quot; in the local Shona language. Father Cripps was buried in the chancel of the church (now a ruin) at Maronda Mashanu.

Some people from the area believe that Arthur Cripps performed miracles. For example, there are claims that a white man who wanted to assault him for associating with Africans was crippled the moment he raised his hand. They claim that the man was only healed when Father Cripps prayed for him.

His great-great-nephew is the Welsh poet, Owen Sheers, who has written about him in the award-winning &quot;Dust Diaries&quot; (2004).

==Legacy==
In his research on his great-great-uncle, Owen Sheers attended the annual memorial service at Cripps&#x27; grave. 
“There were huge crowds of people dancing around the grave,” said Sheers. “It was fascinating that a missionary priest who had gone out there at the turn of the century in a period when the British were more or less the bad guys was still being honoured almost 50 years after his death.&quot;

There is also a road in Harare, Cripps Road, which some say is named after Arthur Cripps, although Owen Sheers&#x27; book indicates the naming was for another dignitary of the same name. The road leading from Chivhu to Cripps&#x27; former mission base is however named Cripps Road in his memory.

<doc id="821897" wikidata="Q7106978" url="?curid=821897" title="Oski Yell">
<text>The Oski Yell is the University of California Berkeley spirit yell from which the school’s mascot, Oski the Bear, derives his name. Although Oski appeared in 1941, the yell was first performed around the turn of the 20th century. The yell&#x27;s origins are uncertain, although the University of Illinois originated a similar yell in 1899 (with a different last line). Another early version is credited to Vince Wirtz, who led a similar cheer beginning in the 1920s at football games for Hamilton, Ontario teams.

==Lyrics==
Berkeley&#x27;s lyrics are:

: &quot;Oski Wow-Wow!&quot;
: &quot;Whiskey Wee-Wee!&quot;
: &quot;Olee! Muckie-eye!&quot;
: &quot;Olee! Berkeley-eye!&quot;
: &quot;California! Wow!&quot;

The Oski Yell is currently rarely heard in the stands, its function overtaken by spirit songs such as &quot;Big C,&quot; &quot;Fight for California,&quot; and &quot;Sons of California.&quot; It can still be heard thundering from the Greek Theatre on Friday nights before the Big Game at the annual Big Game Rally.

==Oskee Wee Wee==
The Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League have a version of the Oski Yell, originally created by Vince Wirtz in the early 1920s. Wirtz developed the choreography for the cheer which was performed by &quot;Pigskin Pete&quot;. The yell is still in use in a modified form called &quot;Oskee Wee Wee&quot; by the current Pigskin Pete at Tiger-Cats games:

: &quot;Oskee Wee Wee&quot; 
: &quot;Oskee Waa Waa&quot;
: &quot;Holy Mackinaw&quot;
: &quot;Tigers ... Eat &#x27;em RAW!!&quot;

Wirtz&#x27;s original version of the cheer is the following:

: &quot;Oskee Wee Wee&quot;
: &quot;Whiskey Wa Wa&quot;
: &quot;Holy Mackinaw&quot;
: &quot;Tigers ... Eat&#x27;em RAW!!&quot;

In 1968, the cheer was the subject of a National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Oskee Wee Wee.&quot;

==Bossy Cow Cow==
A parody of the Berkeley cheer, called &quot;Bossy Cow Cow,&quot; exists at UC Davis (which was originally established as a farm for the use of Berkeley&#x27;s College of Agriculture). This variation of the cheer made its debut during UCD&#x27;s 1926 football game against the College of the Pacific.

: &quot;Bossy Cow-Cow!&quot;
: &quot;Honey Bee-Bee!&quot;
: &quot;Oleo! Margarine!&quot;
: &quot;Oleo! Butterine!&quot;
: &quot;Alfalfa! Hay!&quot;

Bossy Cow-Cow, however, is still used today by the UC Davis Marching Band formerly the California Aggie Marching Band-uh!.

<doc id="821908" wikidata="Q434702" url="?curid=821908" title="Danny Blind">
<text>Dirk Franciscus &quot;Danny&quot; Blind (; born 1 August 1961) is a Dutch former football player and coach. He played as a defender for Sparta Rotterdam, Ajax and the Netherlands national team. As coach he has managed Ajax and the Netherlands national team.

He is one of only two Dutch players, together with Arnold Mühren, to have won all UEFA club competitions.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
Blind made his professional football debut on 29 August 1979 with Sparta Rotterdam. He stayed under contract with Sparta for seven seasons when in July 1986 he transferred to Ajax, attracted there by manager Johan Cruyff. Blind&#x27;s signing, however, was much to the chagrin of Ajax superstar Marco van Basten, who was upset that his manager had brought in a relatively unknown, defensive player from a fairly small club like Sparta, instead of splashing out on a big-money, big-name transfer. With Ajax, Blind amassed an impressive trophy list, winning all three European trophies (UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1987, the UEFA Cup in 1992 and the UEFA Champions League in 1995). He also secured the Intercontinental Cup in 1995 against Brazil&#x27;s Grêmio by scoring the winning penalty in the penalty shoot-out.

Blind was again a penalty hero when he converted twice against Real Zaragoza in the European Super Cup final of 1995, which Ajax won 5–1 over the two legs. The two penalties Blind converted were in the 65th and 69th minutes of the second leg.

Domestically, with Ajax, he won five Dutch Eredivisie Championships and four national cups. He retired on 16 May 1999.

Blind was known for being a solid, dependable defender and a leader on the field. However, he was also a technically gifted and cultured player who could pass and strike the ball well for a non-attacking player. Whilst famous for being a centre back, Blind started his career as a right full-back.

===International career===
Blind gained 42 caps for the Netherlands over a ten-year period, scoring once against Greece in a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifier. He made his debut in 1986 against Scotland but was not capped at all in 1987 or 1988, an absence which meant he missed being a part of the triumphant UEFA Euro 1988 side. He did, however, appear at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups and the 1992 and 1996 European Championships, retiring after the latter.

==Management career==
Blind was head coach at Ajax from 14 March 2005 (appointed as successor to Ronald Koeman) until 10 May 2006, after only 422 days in charge. He led Ajax to victory in the KNVB Cup and the Johan Cruyff Shield.

In 2007–08, Blind became director of football at his old club, Sparta Rotterdam. On 15 May 2008, he returned to Ajax to become the new director of football in Amsterdam but switched roles when Martin Jol joined the club to assistant coach. Moving to the position of technical director for Ajax at the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 9 February 2012 it was announced that Blind would retire from his duties as technical director at Ajax, concluding a heated dispute surrounding the club&#x27;s board of directors.

On 1 July 2015, Blind was named Guus Hiddink&#x27;s successor as head coach of the Netherlands national team. He failed to lead them to Euro 2016, and he put the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign at stake after more meagre results. He was sacked by the Dutch FA on 26 March 2017, the day after losing 2–0 away at Bulgaria, which left their chances of qualification in serious doubt.

On 4 August 2021, Blind returned to the Netherlands national team as assistant to Louis van Gaal.

==Personal life==
Blind is the father of professional footballer Daley Blind, who has played for Ajax and Manchester United. His son is also a Dutch international, and is one of their ten most featured players of all time with over 100 caps.

<doc id="821910" wikidata="Q91301321" url="?curid=821910" title="Pomace brandy">
<text>Pomace spirit (or pomace brandy) is a liquor distilled from pomace that is left over from winemaking, after the grapes are pressed. It is called marc in both English and French, but &quot;grappa&quot; in Italian and &quot;bagaço&quot; in Portuguese. In Spanish it is called orujo. Alcohol derived from pomace is also used as the traditional base spirit of other liquors, such as some anise-flavored spirits. Unlike wine brandy, most pomace brandies are neither aged nor coloured.

==Production==
Pomace may be either fermented, semi-fermented, or unfermented. During red wine vinification, the pomace is left to soak in the must for the entire fermentation period and is thus fermented; fermented pomace is particularly suitable for the production of pomace brandy, as it is soft, dry, and has a high alcohol content. Semi-fermented pomace is produced during &quot;rosé&quot; wine vinification; the pomace is removed before fermentation is complete. Virgin pomace, which is produced during white wine vinification, is not fermented at all.

The pomace is then fermented to completion and the alcohol is then distilled off to produce the pomace brandy.

<doc id="821914" wikidata="Q344661" url="?curid=821914" title="Alcide d'Orbigny">
<text>Alcide Charles Victor Marie Dessalines d&#x27;Orbigny (6 September 1802 – 30 June 1857) was a French naturalist who made major contributions in many areas, including zoology (including malacology), palaeontology, geology, archaeology and anthropology.

D&#x27;Orbigny was born in Couëron (Loire-Atlantique), the son of a ship&#x27;s physician and amateur naturalist. The family moved to La Rochelle in 1820, where his interest in natural history was developed while studying the marine fauna and especially the microscopic creatures that he named &quot;foraminiferans&quot;.

In Paris he became a disciple of the geologist Pierre Louis Antoine Cordier (1777–1861) and Georges Cuvier. All his life, he would follow the theory of Cuvier and stay opposed to Lamarckism.

==South American era==
D&#x27;Orbigny travelled on a mission for the Paris Museum, in South America between 1826 and 1833. He visited Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, and returned to France with an enormous collection of more than 10,000 natural history specimens. He described part of his findings in &quot;La Relation du Voyage dans l&#x27;Amérique Méridionale pendant les annés 1826 à 1833&quot; (Paris, 1824–47, in 90 fascicles). The other specimens were described by zoologists at the museum.

His contemporary, Charles Darwin, arrived in South America in 1832, and on hearing that he had been preceded, grumbled that D&#x27;Orbigny had probably collected &quot;the cream of all the good things&quot;. Darwin later called D&#x27;Orbigny&#x27;s Voyage a &quot;most important work&quot;. They went on to correspond, with D&#x27;Orbigny describing some of Darwin&#x27;s specimens.

He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Société de Géographie of Paris in 1834. The South American Paleocene pantodont &quot;Alcidedorbignya&quot; was named in his honour.

==1840 and later==
In 1840, d&#x27;Orbigny started the methodical description of French fossils and published &quot;La Paléontologie Française&quot; (8 vols). In 1849 he published a closely related &quot;Prodrome de Paléontologie Stratigraphique&quot;, intended as a &quot;Preface to Stratigraphic Palaeontology&quot;, in which he described almost 18,000 species, and with biostratigraphical comparisons erected geological stages, the definitions of which rest on their stratotypes.

In 1853 he became professor of palaeontology at the Paris Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, publishing his &quot;Cours élémentaire&quot; that related paleontology to zoology, as a science independent of the uses made of it in stratigraphy. The chair of paleontology was created especially in his honor. The d&#x27;Orbigny collection is housed in the &quot;Salle d&#x27;Orbigny&quot; and is often visited by experts.

He described the geological timescales and defined numerous geological strata, still used today as chronostratigraphic reference such as Toarcian, Callovian, Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, Aptian, Albian and Cenomanian. He died in the small town of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, near Paris.

==Catastrophism==

D&#x27;Orbigny, a disciple of Georges Cuvier, was a notable advocate of catastrophism.

He recognized twenty-seven catastrophes in the fossil record. This became known as the &quot;doctrine of successive creations&quot;. He attempted to reconcile the fossil record with the Genesis creation narrative. Both uniformitarian geologists and theologians rejected his idea of successive creations.

Palaeontologist Carroll Lane Fenton has noted that his idea of twenty-seven world-wide creations was &quot;absurd&quot;, even for creationists. L. Sprague de Camp has written that &quot;Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny, carried the idea to absurdity. Dragging in the supernatural, d&#x27;Orbigny argued that, on twenty-seven separate occasions, God had wiped out all life on earth and started over with a whole new creation.&quot;

==Taxa==
Several zoological and botanical taxa were named in his honor, including the following genera and species.
*&quot;Alcidedorbignya&quot; – an extinct genus of pantodont mammal
*&quot;Alcidia&quot; – a genus of sea snails
*&quot;Ampullaria dorbignyana&quot; – a species of freshwater snail
*&quot;Apostolepis dorbignyi&quot; – a species of burrowing snake
*&quot;Asthenes dorbignyi&quot; - a species of furnariid bird
*&quot;Bachia dorbignyi&quot; – a species of lizard
*&quot;Cadomites orbignyi&quot; – a species of ammonites from the Bathonian
*&quot;Chaunus dorbignyi&quot; – a species of toad
*&quot;Haminoea orbignyana&quot; – a species of sea snail
*&quot;Hecticoceras (Orbignyceras)&quot; – a subgenus of ammonite from the Callovian
*&quot;Liolaemus dorbignyi&quot; – a species of lizard
*&quot;Lystrophis dorbignyi&quot; – a species of snake
*&quot;Nerocila orbignyi&quot; – a species of ectoparasitic isopod
*&quot;Orbignya&quot; – a genus of palm trees, which includes the species &quot;Orbignya speciosa&quot; , commonly known as the Brazilian palm tree or &quot;babaçu&quot; in Portuguese
*&quot;Pinna dorbignyi&quot; – a species of bivalve mollusc

*&quot;Potamotrygon orbignyi&quot; – a species of freshwater stingray
*&quot;Quadracythere orbignyana&quot; – a species of marine ostracod
*&quot;Rhinodoras dorbignyi&quot; – a species of thorny catfish
*&quot;Sepia (Rhombosepion) orbignyana&quot; – a species of cuttlefish, commonly known as the pink cuttlefish
*&quot;Subdiscosphinctes orbignyi&quot; – a species of ammonites from the Kimmeridgian
*&quot;Trachemys dorbigni&quot; – a species of freshwater turtle

In the above list, a taxon author or binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than the genus to which the species is currently assigned.

* The most popular and widespread modern use of the term is as a slang expletive in Irish English, employed as a less serious alternative to the expletive &quot;fuck&quot; to express disbelief, surprise, pain, anger, or contempt. It notably lacks the sexual connotations that &quot;fuck&quot; has.
* It is also used as Irish slang meaning &quot;throw&quot; (e.g. &quot;he fecked the remote control across the table at me&quot;.)
* It has also been used as a verb meaning &quot;to steal&quot; (e.g. &quot;they had fecked cash out of the rector&#x27;s room&quot;) or to discover a safe method of robbery or cheating.

==Scots and Late Middle English==
&quot;Feck&quot; is a form of , which is in turn the Scots cognate of the modern English word . However, this Scots noun has additional significance:
# Efficacy; force; value; return
# Amount; quantity (or a large amount/quantity)
# The greater or larger part (when used with a definite article)

From the first sense can be derived &quot;&quot;, meaning witless, weak, or ineffective. &quot;Feckless&quot; remains a part of Modern English and Scottish English, and appears in a number of Scottish adages:

:&quot;Feckless folk are aye fain o ane anither.&quot;

:&quot;Feckless fools should keep canny tongues.&quot;

In his 1881 short story &quot;Thrawn Janet&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson invokes the second sense of &quot;feck&quot; as cited above:

:&quot;He had a feck o&#x27; books wi&#x27; him—mair than had ever been seen before in a&#x27; that presbytery...&quot;

Robert Burns uses the third sense of &quot;feck&quot; in the final stanza of his 1792 poem &quot;Kellyburn Braes&quot;:

:I hae been a Devil the feck o&#x27; my life,
:Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi&#x27; thyme;
:&quot;But ne&#x27;er was in hell till I met wi&#x27; a wife,&quot;
:And the thyme it is wither&#x27;d, and rue is in prime

==In the media==
The Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot; (19951998) helped to popularise the use of &quot;feck&quot; outside of Ireland (particularly in the UK, where Channel 4 is based) through liberal use of the word by alcoholic priest Father Jack.

In a 1998 interview on Nickelodeon, an appearance by the teenage Irish girl group B*Witched prompted a viewer complaint alleging that one of its members had said &quot;fuck off&quot; on air. Nickelodeon maintained that the singer had in fact said &quot;feck off&quot;, which they described as &quot;a phrase made popular by the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;&quot;, but the phrase was still found to be in breach of the ITC Programme Code and the complaint was thus upheld.

In 2004, clothing retailer French Connection UK (best known for its infamous &quot;FCUK&quot; T-shirt) won a legal injunction in Dublin that barred a local business from printing and selling a T-shirt marked &quot;FCEK: The Irish Connection&quot;.

In 2008, the Irish cider brand Magners received complaints relating to an advert it had posted around the UK in which a man tells bees to &quot;feck off&quot;, with members of the public concerned that young children could be badly influenced by it. Magners claimed that the &quot;feck off&quot; mention in the advert was a &quot;mild rebuff&quot; to the bees rather than an expletive. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the poster was suitable for display.

<text>Oski the Bear (Oski) is the official mascot of the University of California, Berkeley (&quot;Cal&quot;), representing the California Golden Bears. Named after the Oski Yell, he made his debut at a freshman rally in the Greek Theatre on September 25, 1941. Prior to his debut, live bears were used as Cal mascots.
Oski&#x27;s name, design, and character were developed by William “Rocky” Rockwell, who was the first student to play the role, and Warrington Colescott, an editor of &quot;The Daily Californian&quot; and famed satirist. 

Since his debut, Oski&#x27;s activities have been managed by the &quot;Oski Committee&quot;, which also appoints a new Oski whenever a replacement is required. Historically, persons who played Oski were male and of short stature (under 5&#x27;7&quot;), although the gender requirement was dropped around 1974.

Oski&#x27;s identity is protected by the Committee, and wearers of the suit generally do not disclose their identity to the public. One faculty member is aware of the students on the Oski Committee to provide accountability for any incidents. To that end, there may be multiple members of the Committee who wear the suit, depending on their schedules.

== Incidents ==
Oski was suspended for two weeks in January 1990, for throwing a cake towards Oregon State fans, of which some landed on the father of Oregon State point guard Gary Payton. 

In 1999, the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) passed a bill calling for a makeover of the &quot;poorly constructed and pathetic version of a bear&quot;. The ASUC president vetoed the bill.

<text>Stephen Phillips (28 July 1864 – 9 December 1915) was an English poet and dramatist, who enjoyed considerable popularity early in his career.

==Biography==
He was born at Summertown near Oxford, the son of the Rev. Stephen Phillips, precentor of Peterborough Cathedral. He was educated at Stratford and Peterborough Grammar Schools, and considered entering Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge on a minor scholarship to study classics; but he instead went to a London crammer to prepare for the civil service. In 1885, however, he moved to Wolverhampton to join his cousin F. R. Benson&#x27;s dramatic company, and for six years he played various small parts.

In 1890 a slender volume of verse was published at Oxford with the title &quot;Primavera&quot;, which contained contributions by him and by his cousin Laurence Binyon and others. In 1894 he published &quot;Eremus&quot;, a long poem of loose structure in blank verse of a philosophical complexion. In 1896 appeared &quot;Christ in Hades&quot;, forming with a few other short pieces one of the slim paper-covered volumes of Elkin Mathews&#x27;s Shilling Garland. This poem caught the eye of the critics, and when it was followed by a collection of &quot;Poems&quot; in 1897 the writer&#x27;s position as a new poet of exceptional gifts was generally recognized. This volume contained a new edition of &quot;Christ in Hades&quot;, together with &quot;Marpessa&quot;, &quot;The Woman with the Dead Soul&quot;, &quot;The Wife&quot; and shorter pieces, including &quot;To Milton, Blind&quot;. The volume won the prize of £100 offered by the &quot;Academy&quot; newspaper for the best new book of its year, ran through half a dozen editions in two years, and established Phillips&#x27;s rank as poet, which was sustained by the publication, in the &quot;Nineteenth Century&quot; in 1898 of his poem &quot;Endymion&quot;.

Sir George Alexander, the actor-manager, moved perhaps by a certain clamour among the critics for a literary drama, then commissioned Phillips to write him a play, the result being &quot;Paolo and Francesca&quot; (1900), a drama founded on Dante&#x27;s famous episode from &quot;Inferno&quot;. Encouraged by the great success of the drama in its literary form, Mr Alexander produced the piece at the St. James&#x27; Theatre in 1902. In the meantime, Phillips&#x27;s next play, &quot;Herod: a Tragedy&quot;, had been produced by Beerbohm Tree on 31 October 1900, and was published as a book in 1901; &quot;Ulysses&quot;, also produced by Beerbohm Tree, was published in 1902; &quot;The Sin of David&quot;, a drama on the story of David and Bathsheba, translated into the times and terms of Cromwellian England, was published in 1904; and &quot;Nero&quot;, produced by Beerbohm Tree, was published in 1906. In these plays the poet&#x27;s avowed aim was, instead of attempting to revive the method of Shakespeare and the Elizabethans, to revitalize the method of Greek drama. &quot;Paolo and Francesca&quot; (which admitted certainly one scene on an Elizabethan model) was the most successful.

When a theatrical production of &quot;Ulysses&quot; was staged at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London, in 1902 the opening night was attended by the Royal Family, nobility, politicians, and many other members of high society. The 29 January 1902 issue of &quot;The Tatler&quot; reported that the artist Henry Jamyn Brooks was working on a picture of the attendees, which was to include some 300 portraits.

For his earlier career, see the section on Stephen Phillips in &quot;Poets of the Younger Generation&quot;, by William Archer (1902); also the articles on &#x27;Tragedy and Mr Stephen Phillips&#x27;, by William Watson in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; (March 1898); &#x27;The Poetry of Mr Stephen Phillips&#x27;, in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; (January 1900); &#x27;Mr Stephen Phillips&#x27;, in &quot;The Century&quot; (January 1901), by Edmund Gosse; and &#x27;Mr Stephen Phillips&#x27;, in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; (April 1902), by Arthur Symons.

While enjoying success in the theatre Phillips continued to write and publish poetry. In 1908 he brought out &quot;New Poems&quot;, and then in 1911 his longest poem, &quot;The New Inferno&quot; (1911). This was followed by &quot;Lyrics and Dramas&quot; (1913) and &quot;Panama and other Poems&quot; (1915). From January 1913 until his death he was editor of &quot;The Poetry Review&quot;.

Shortly before his death Phillips completed &quot;Harold&quot;, a verse play about the Norman conquest. In October 1915 he fell ill after suffering a severe chill. He died in Deal in Kent, on 9 December 1915, of cirrhosis of the liver and exhaustion. He was buried in the cemetery at Hastings on 13 December 1915.

<doc id="821928" wikidata="Q2477069" url="?curid=821928" title="Jeffrey Sinclair">
<text>Jeffrey Sinclair is a fictional character on the space opera television series titled &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. He is the original Commander of the Babylon 5 space station.

Portrayed by Michael O&#x27;Hare, the character appeared regularly on the first season of the show and made a number of guest appearances early in season two (&quot;The Coming of Shadows&quot;) and returned in season three for a two-part episode (&quot;War Without End&quot;).

In the second season, Sinclair was succeeded as space station Commander by John J. Sheridan (portrayed by Bruce Boxleitner.)

== Role in &quot;Babylon 5&quot; ==
=== Character arc ===
Jeffrey Sinclair is introduced in the 1993 pilot film, &quot;Babylon 5: The Gathering&quot;, which takes place roughly one year before the first-season episode &quot;Midnight on the Firing Line&quot;.

Jeffrey Sinclair was born on the Mars Colony. During the first season of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, Sinclair states that his family had been fighter pilots &quot;ever since the Battle of Britain&quot; and that his father was a fighter pilot for EarthForce who participated in the last battle of the &quot;Dilgar Invasion.&quot; Sinclair continued this family tradition by becoming a fighter pilot. The season one episode &quot;By Any Means Necessary&quot; establishes that Sinclair received Jesuit education as a young man. 

Sinclair was promoted to fighter pilot and — less than a year later — promoted to squadron leader. Due to his rapid rise through the ranks, it was rumored that he was on the fast track to making admiral. In the made-for-television film, &quot;Babylon 5: In the Beginning&quot;, Sinclair fights during the last major battle in the Earth-Minbari War. His squadron is destroyed by the Minbari and he is captured for interrogation by the Grey Council. The Triluminary reveals that Sinclair possesses Minbari DNA and the soul of a Minbari hero who led their people to victory in a battle against the Shadows one-thousand years ago. Concluding that Minbari souls are being born into human bodies, the Minbari opt to surrender despite possessing overwhelming military superiority. Once the Minbari return Sinclair to his fighter, he loses his memory of his time aboard the Minbari cruiser.

When the Babylon 5 space station was established, Sinclair was appointed as the leader by the Minbari race who were responsible for its creation. He was selected over many senior officers, including Colonel Ari Ben Zayn, all of whom had been vetoed by the Minbari.

In &quot;Babylon 5&quot; season 2, Sinclair was reassigned as ambassador to Minbar. He was succeeded at Babylon 5 by Captain John Sheridan. As ambassador, he took command of the Rangers. In 2260, Sinclair received a 900-year old letter from himself on Minbar, revealing that he was not the &quot;reincarnation&quot; of Valen, as the Grey Council believed, but in fact Valen himself. Armed with this knowledge, Sinclair took Babylon 4 back with him 1,000 years to aid the Minbari in their first war against the Shadows and, in so doing, fulfilled Minbari prophecy by becoming the One Who Was. Sinclair uses the Triluminary to transform himself into a Minbari and fulfills the legend about Valen being &quot;a Minbari not born of Minbari.&quot;

=== Relationships ===
Sinclair enlisted in EarthForce in 2237. While working as a flight instructor at EarthForce Academy, he met second-year cadet Catherine Sakai. This marked the beginning of a 15 year on-again off-again relationship. Sinclair proposes to Sakai during the season one finale; this episode marks Sinclair and Sakai&#x27;s final regular appearances in the series.

== Departure and reception ==
After filming one full season, O&#x27;Hare and the series executive producer/creator J. Michael Straczynski mutually decided for the actor (and character) to depart as a series regular. Straczynski announced O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s departure via a written statement posted on GEnie on May 20, 1994:This is a mutual, amicable, and friendly separation. This isn&#x27;t a Tasha Yar situation. Moreover, we will be handling this in such a way that, down the road, Sinclair could potentially return to the story. ...I take pains to mention this because both Michael [O&#x27;Hare] and I want it clear that we both believe in the show, and want this in no way to interfere with the series. He has asked me to convey for him his encouragement, his best wishes, and to emphasize that this is, again, an amicable and friendly separation.Responding to backlash from fans, Straczynski added: &quot;Please do not stick this on O&#x27;Hare. Whatever decisions get made, it is up to the producers — me and Doug — to implement those decisions, so ultimate responsibility rests with me. If you&#x27;re going to be angry at anyone, be angry at me.&quot; O&#x27;Hare left the series for mental health reasons that were not disclosed at the time.

Straczynski revealed the circumstances of O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s departure from &quot;Babylon 5&quot; at a presentation about the series at the Phoenix Comicon. During the filming of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, O&#x27;Hare struggled with severe mental illness including paranoid delusions and hallucinations. Straczynski offered to suspend production to let O&#x27;Hare seek treatment and return to the show as a series regular; however, O&#x27;Hare feared that a long hiatus would put the series at risk and he did not want to jeopardize others&#x27; jobs. Straczynski agreed to keep O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s condition secret to protect his career.

Straczynski emphasized that O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s fans, particularly those of his role as Sinclair, had helped him cope with his struggle in ways &quot;medication never could.&quot; O&#x27;Hare told Straczynski that fans deserved to eventually learn the real reason for his departure, and that his experience could raise awareness and understanding for people with mental illness.

O&#x27;Hare reprised the character of Sinclair on season two and had a two-episode guest appearance in season three. As a result of his departure, there are several minor inconsistencies between the first season and the remainder of the show, most visibly in &quot;And the Sky Full of Stars&quot; and &quot;Babylon Squared.&quot;

In literary analysis of characters in pop culture and science fiction, Jeffrey Sinclair has been examined as a hero and leader.

<doc id="821931" wikidata="Q1410617" url="?curid=821931" title="Louisiana Museum of Modern Art">
<text>The Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, also known as the Louisiana, is an art museum located north of Copenhagen, Denmark. Attracting over 700,000 guests annually, the Louisiana is Scandinavia&#x27;s most visited museum for modern and contemporary art, hosting 6 to 10 exhibitions each year alongside a permanent display of Yayoi Kusama&#x27;s &quot;Gleaming&quot; &quot;Lights of the Souls&quot;. The museum is recognized as a modernist landmark in Danish architecture, and is noted for its synthesis of art, architecture and landscape, boasting a sculpture park with works by Alexander Calder, Henry Moore and Richard Serra. In addition to its permanent and temporary exhibitions, the museum has a shop featuring Danish design items, a restaurant with a view of the Øresund, and a three-storey Children&#x27;s Wing hosting daily workshops. The museum is included in Patricia Schultz&#x27;s book &quot;1,000 Places to See Before You Die&quot;.

== Location ==
The museum is located by the Øresund coast in the North Zeeland region, some north of central Copenhagen and south of Elsinore. From the regional train station in Humlebæk, it takes 10–15 minutes to walk to the museum.

== Exhibitions ==
Since 1958, the Louisiana has presented international art and culture to a Danish and international audience. The annual programme features 6-10 temporary exhibitions. Between 2020 and 2024, the museum hosted exhibitions by artists and architects including Roni Horn, Franz Gertsch, Chaïm Soutine, Firelei Báez, Pussy Riot, Cave_bureau, Ragnar Kjartansson, Nan Goldin, Niko Pirosmani, Andy Warhol, Dana Schutz, Gauri Gill, Richard Prince, August Sander, Alex Da Corte, Dorothy Iannone, Forensic Architecture, Diane Arbus, Sonia Delaunay, Peter Cook, Jens Adolf Jerichau, Mika Rottenberg, Pia Arke, Mamma Andersson, Arthur Jafa, Troels Wörsel, Taryn Simon, Anupama Kundoo, Tetsumi Kudo, Per Kirkeby, and Nancy Spero. The museum has also showcased large-scale interdisciplinary exhibitions focusing on the Arctic, the Moon, the Ocean, and other topics.

== Collections ==

===Modern art===
The museum has a wide range of modern art paintings, photographic works, sculptures and videos dating from World War II onwards, including works by artists such as Alberto Giacometti, Louise Bourgeois, Andy Warhol, Diane Arbus, Roy Lichtenstein, Anselm Kiefer, Francesca Woodman, Pablo Picasso, Philip Guston, Yves Klein, Susan Rothenberg, Robert Rauschenberg, Germaine Richier, David Hockney and Asger Jorn. Perched above the sea, there is a sculpture garden between the museum&#x27;s two wings with works by artists including Henry Moore, Alexander Calder, and Jean Arp.

=== Contemporary art ===
The Louisiana&#x27;s collection is continually updated through acquisitions and donations. Recent acquisitions span a wide range of media and artistic expressions, featuring works by artists such as Roni Horn, Yayoi Kusama, Pipilotti Rist, William Kentridge, Marina Abramović, Cecily Brown, Dana Schutz, Sophie Calle, Alex Da Corte, Malene Dumas, Nan Goldin, Shilpa Gupta, Ragnar Kjartansson, Mona Hatoum, Arthur Jafa, Cindy Sherman, Richard Prince, Ann Veronica Janssens, Amy Sillman, Jon Rafman, Tal R, Michel Majerus, Catherine Opie, Superflex, Rosemarie Trockel, Bouchra Khalili, Gauri Gill, Dora Budor, and Nina Beier.

== Louisiana Channel ==
Louisiana Channel is a non-profit web TV channel launched in 2012 and based at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. The channel has developed into the world’s largest archive of contemporary art, featuring the artists, with videos available on the channel&#x27;s website, Instagram, and YouTube. According to &quot;New York Times,&quot; &quot;No museum has used streaming video more ambitiously than the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art&quot;. And the &quot;The Art Newspaper&quot; has stated that the Louisiana &quot;punches hugely above its weight on its broadcast channel, going far beyond art and consistently featuring leading writers, musicians and architects. Louisiana does deep dives particularly well: a documentary about Ulay and Marina Abramović is exemplary, and a series of films in which artists including David Salle and Tal R discuss the influence of the painter Marsden Hartley reflects the incisiveness artists can bring to understanding the work of their forebears.&quot;

== Louisiana Literature Festival ==
Launched in 2010, the Louisiana&#x27;s literary festival, Louisiana Literature, celebrates exceptional writing from around the globe. Each year, the festival features about forty writers, who perform on stages around the museum and in the sculpture park, attracting more than 15,000 people each year. From 2022 to 2024, the festival featured authors such as Adania Shibli, Rachel Cusk, Kim de l&#x27;Horizon, Anne Boyer, Anne Carson, Colm Tóibín, Danez Smith, Haruki Murakami, Joyce Carol Oates, Ali Smith, Tessa Hadley, Ian McEwan, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Wole Soyinka, Ocean Vuong, Torrey Peters, Deborah Levy, Laurie Anderson, Benjamín Labatut, Bernardine Evaristo, Édouard Louis, and Natasha Brown.

==History==

=== Building a museum of modern art ===
The history of the museum goes back some 170 years. The name of the museum is derived from the first owner of the property, &quot;hofjægermester&quot; Alexander Brun, who named the estate after his three wives, all called Louise. Brun built the villa in which the part of the museum resides in 1855. A hundred years later, in 1955, businessman and cheese wholesaler Knud W. Jensen purchased the by then abandoned villa and surrounding property after being snubbed of the opportunity to purchase land around Rungstedlund for his planned museum; this was reportedly due to the sellers objection on the grounds of modern art not being art. Jensen had been interested in art and literature since the 1940s, but after acquiring the publishing company Gyldendal in 1952, his interest in art materialized; Jensen founded the &quot;Art at the Workplace&quot; association, leasing artworks to companies for the enjoyment of their employees. Meanwhile, he found conventional art museums at the time to be alienating and uninviting, citing the National Gallery of Denmark as a typical example. As Jensen felt that these buildings&#x27; grandiose architecture didn&#x27;t fit for modern art, he aimed to create a museum with an &quot;appropriate atmosphere&quot; wherein people &quot;...feel obliged [...] to approach the works of art.&quot; He has further stated a great sense of inspiration from American museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art.

Wishing to instead create a museum on a &quot;human scale&quot; that was close to nature, he first approached Jørn Utzon to design the museum; however, Utzon was already commissioned to design the now iconic Sydney Opera House, and so he declined. In lieu of this, he partnered up with architects Vilhelm Wohlert and Jørgen Bo, who spent a few months walking around the property before deciding how a new construction would best fit into the landscape. This study resulted in the first version of the museum consisting of three buildings connected by glass corridors, which opened in conjunction with the museum as a whole, in 1958. The first exhibition had several faults according to Jensen himself, the building lacked climate control and the storage room was insufficient. The museum received criticism, from among others, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, who referred to the newly opened museum as &quot;Cirkusiana&quot;. Jensen intended for the museum to be mixture between art, architecture, and nature; music, film, dance, and political debates would all take place at the Louisiana. Critics posited that the other forms of entertainment would ultimately distract from the art itself, though Jensen stated that art was not the entire focus of the venue. The decision to have a café built into the museum was also controversial, Jensen stated in an interview that &quot;good drinking and food is very important in connection with experiencing art.&quot; His personal ideas and ambitions largely steered the development of the museum, despite the existence of a board of directors. He has emphasized the idea of the Louisiana as a cultural center, &quot;I believe much more in the idea of a cultural center than [that] of a museum.&quot; Shortly after opening, the Louisiana became known in the international art world for its at times controversial exhibitions; the museum has used the self-coined &quot;sauna-princippen&quot; (), a combination of uncontroversial &quot;warm&quot; and transgressive &quot;cold&quot; exhibitions. One such controversy was a Nam June Paik concert which ended chaotically and with largely negative reactions from the crowd. These controversies nonetheless garnered attention for the Louisiana; Jensen expected 40,000 visitors in the first year, the museum received 200,000.

=== International outlook ===
Up until 1959, the works featured at the Louisiana were primarily Danish in origin. During Jensen&#x27;s visit to the art exhibition Documenta II in Kassel, Germany, he saw the works Alberto Giacometti, Alexander Calder, and Henry Moore. He described it as a &quot;Documenta shock&quot;, and decided to try and persuade the board of directors to start featuring international art at the Louisiana. He eventually succeeded, despite the skepticism of the board; at the time there was no internationally inclined modern art museum in Denmark. The art exhibition affected him to such an extent that he organized the exhibition &quot;Works from Documenta&quot; just weeks after the show was hosted.

The decision to feature international art has later been hailed as &quot;decisive&quot; by art historian Kristian Handberg, and the exhibitions of international art have become a hallmark of the museum; it fostered a &quot;new Louisiana&quot;, with new exhibition halls being constructed for the international exhibitions. Among these were &quot;Vitality in Art&quot; and &quot;Movement in Art&quot;, composed by Willem Sandberg, along with Jean Tinguely&#x27;s manifesto &quot;Sketch for the End of the World&quot;. These exhibitions brought together contemporary artists from both the United States and Europe. Handberg has stated that the achievement of bringing the Louisiana into the wider European circulation of international art exhibitions on the part of Jensen is a &quot;remarkable&quot; feat. The Louisiana gained the status of state-authorized museum in 1968, and began to receive financial support from the Danish state. It had by this point begun to receive criticism from younger artists who considered the museum to be &quot;old fashioned&quot; and lacking the latest art. It has nevertheless continued to feature modern and contemporary art through its exhibitions, featuring the likes of Nouveau Réalisme, Pop art, and Minimalist art.

The collection of the museum includes several pieces made specifically for it, Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;Figures in Landscape&quot; was painted in 1977 following a visit to the museum. Similarly, Sam Francis created a series of paintings for the museum during his visit in 1979, and Jim Dine&#x27;s painting for a specific room in the museum.

=== Louisiana in the 21st century ===
Since Poul Erik Tøjner became director in 2000, the Louisiana has earned a place on the international stage as an institution that is both artistically and economically successful. Each year, the museum hosts 6 to 10 temporary exhibitions alongside live events, a festival, and new digital initiatives that broaden its reach. Since 2010, the Louisiana Literature festival has hosted forty writers annually across the museum and sculpture park, while the Louisiana Channel, launched in 2012, shares weekly art and culture videos to engage new generations and promote cultural understanding.

In 2023, the Louisiana finalized its 2050 sustainability strategy, focusing on climate, circularity, biodiversity, and social responsibility. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement&#x27;s 1.5°C goal, with targets verified by the Science Based Targets initiative. Recognized as a &quot;Green Attraction,&quot; the museum is recognized for its efforts in advancing sustainable practices within the cultural sector.

== Architecture ==

The architecture of the Louisiana is considered to be an instrumental part of the museum experience, and has been used as a point of comparison to other buildings. Architects Vilhelm Wohlert and Jørgen Bo were contacted by Knud W. Jensen to design the new museum building. At first Jensen had contacted Jørn Utzon to design the museum, who himself owned a house in nearby Hellebæk. However, as Utzon was busy with working on his later successful design for the Sydney Opera House, he declined the offer. Wohlert and Bo&#x27;s study of the property over the course of several months resulted in the first version of the museum consisting of three buildings connected by glass corridors, which opened in 1958 and is designated as the &quot;Nordfløj&quot; (North Wing). A clear source of inspiration for this building was the Kings Road House by Rudolph Schindler in Los Angeles, along with Richard Neutra&#x27;s &quot;Bailey House&quot; in Pacific Palisades. The building was subsequently expanded with the addition of the &quot;Vestfløj&quot; (West Wing) in 1966 and again in 1971, collectively adding two more floors. The change in architectural direction with the expansion of the &quot;Sydfløj&quot; (South Wing) in 1982, is largely the result of the increasing size and dimensions of the works of art in the exhibitions. According to Jensen, large portions of the permanent collection had to be stored away for most of the year, as to make room for the temporary exhibitions; the much larger spaces of the South Wing are in that sense &quot;tailor-made for the international collection&quot;, in Jensen&#x27;s own words. 

=== Concert hall ===
In 1976 the concert hall was inaugurated, connected to the North Wing. Its acoustics make it especially suitable for chamber music, but it is also used for other musical genres as well as a wide array of others events and activities such as debates, lectures and symposiums. The chairs are designed by Poul Kjærholm. The museum hosts an active concert programme featuring world-famous classical musicians such as Grigory Sokolov, Arcadi Volodos, Emmanuel Pahud and Midori Gotō.

==Sculpture garden==

The grounds around the museum contain a landscaped sculpture garden. It consists of a plateau and ground that slopes towards the Øresund and is dominated by huge, ancient specimen trees and sweeping vistas of the sea. It contains works by such artists as Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Max Bill, Alexander Calder, Alicja Kwade, Henri Laurens, Joan Miró and Henry Moore. The sculptures are either placed so that they can be viewed from within, in special sculpture yards or independently around the gardens, forming a synthesis with the lawns, the trees and the sea.

==Directors==
*1958 —1993: Knud W. Jensen
*1995 —1998: Lars Nittve
*1998 —2000: Steingrim Laursen
*2000 —: Poul Erik Tøjner

== Partners and sponsors ==
The Louisiana is an independent institution receiving government grants. However, the vast majority of the museum&#x27;s funding comes from its own revenue, bolstered significantly by support from partners, sponsors, and foundations such as the A.P. Møller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney Møllers Fond til almene Formaal, Augustinus Fonden, C.L. Davids Fond og Samling, Realdania, and Ny Carlsbergfondet.

<text>The .22 long rifle, also known as the .22 LR or 5.7×15mmR, is a long-established variety of .22 caliber rimfire ammunition originating from the United States. It is used in a wide range of firearms including rifles, pistols, revolvers, and submachine guns.

In terms of units sold, it is by far the most common ammunition that is manufactured and sold in the world. Common uses include hunting and shooting sports. Ammunition produced in .22 long rifle is effective at short ranges, has little recoil, and is inexpensive to purchase. These qualities make it ideal for plinking and marksmanship training.

==History==
American cartridge manufacturer J. Stevens Arms &amp; Tool Company introduced the .22 long rifle cartridge in 1887.The round owes its origin to the .22 BB Cap of 1845 and the .22 Short of 1857. It combined the case of the .22 long of 1871 with a bullet, giving it a longer overall length, a higher muzzle velocity and superior performance as a hunting and target round, rendering the .22 extra long cartridges obsolete. The .22 LR uses a heeled bullet, which means that the bullet is the same diameter as the case, and has a narrower &quot;heel&quot; portion that fits inside the case. It is one of the few cartridges that are accepted by a large variety of rifles and handguns.

===Popularity===
The .22 LR cartridge is popular with both novice shooters and experts. Its minimal recoil and relatively low noise make it an ideal cartridge for recreational shooting, small-game hunting, and pest control. .22 LR cadet rifles are commonly used by military cadets and others for basic firearms and marksmanship training. It is used by the Boy Scouts of America for the rifle shooting merit badge.

The low recoil of the cartridge makes it ideal for introductory firearms courses. Novice shooters can be surprised or frightened by the noise and recoil of more powerful rounds. Beginners shooting firearms beyond their comfort level frequently develop a habit of flinching in an attempt to counter anticipated recoil. The resulting habit impedes correct posture and follow-through at the most critical phase of the shot and is difficult to correct. With high recoil eliminated, other errors in marksmanship technique are easier to identify and correct.

Available for this round are AR-15 upper receivers and M1911 slide assemblies. Many handgun manufacturers have an upper pistol conversion kit to make it shoot .22 LR ammunition. These conversions allow shooters to practice inexpensively while retaining the handling characteristics of their chosen firearms (with reduced recoil and muzzle blast). Additionally, .22 LR cartridge conversion kits allow practice at indoor ranges which prohibit high-power firearms. Owners of guns that use gas systems, such as AR-15 sport style rifles, normally avoid firing non-plated .22 LR cartridge ammunition, as the use of non-plated ammunition may cause lead-fouling of the gas-port inside the barrel and costly gunsmithing procedures. This can usually be mitigated by swapping the conversion kit for the standard bolt carrier group and firing several full-powered rounds to clear the gas port and tube of any accumulated lead fouling. While not 100% effective, the extremely hot incandescent gasses produced by centerfire rifle ammunition will help to clear any lead fouling from the .22 LR ammunition.

A wide variety of .22 LR ammunition is available commercially, and the available ammunition varies widely both in price and performance. Bullet weights among commercially available ammunition range from , and velocities vary from . .22 LR is the least costly cartridge ammunition available. Promotional loads for plinking can be purchased in bulk for significantly less cost than precision target rounds. The low cost of ammunition has a substantial effect on the popularity of the .22 LR. For this reason, rimfire cartridges are commonly used for target practice.

.22 LR cartridges are commonly packaged in boxes of 50 or 100 rounds, and are often sold by the &#x27;brick&#x27;, a carton containing either 10 boxes of 50 rounds or loose cartridges totaling 500 rounds, or the &#x27;case&#x27; containing 10 bricks totaling 5,000 rounds. Annual production is estimated by some at 2–2.5 billion rounds. The NSSF estimates that a large percentage of the US production of 10 billion cartridges is composed of .22 LR. Despite the high production figures there have occasionally been shortages of .22 LR cartridge in the contiguous United States, most notably during the U.S. ammunition shortage of the late 2000s and early 2010s.

== Performance ==
The .22 LR is effective to , though practical ranges tend to be less. After 150 yards, the ballistics of the round are such that it will be difficult to compensate for the large &quot;drop&quot;. The relatively short effective range, low report, and light recoil have made it a favorite for use as a target-practice cartridge. The accuracy of the cartridge is good, but not exceptional; various cartridges are capable of the same or better accuracy. A contributing factor in rifles is the transition of even a high-velocity cartridge projectile from supersonic to subsonic within . As the bullet slows, the shock wave caused by supersonic travel overtakes the bullet and can disrupt its flight path, causing minor but measurable inaccuracies.

When zeroed for , the arc-trajectory of the standard high-velocity .22 LR with a bullet has a rise at , and a drop at . A .22 LR rifle needs to be zeroed for to avoid overshooting small animals like squirrels at intermediate distances.

As a hunting cartridge, rimfires are mainly used to kill small game up to the size of coyotes. Although proper shot placement can kill larger animals such as deer or hog, it is not recommended because its low power may not guarantee a humane kill. In 2013, an elephant was killed by multiple shots from a .22 LR rifle.

Because a .22 LR bullet is less powerful than larger cartridges, its danger to humans is often underestimated. A .22 LR bullet is easily capable of killing or injuring humans. Even after flying , a .22 bullet is still traveling at about . Ricochets are more common in .22 LR projectiles than for more powerful cartridges as the combination of unjacketed lead and moderate velocities allows the projectile to deflectnot penetrate or disintegratewhen hitting hard objects at a glancing angle. A .22 LR bullet can ricochet off the surface of water at a low angle of aim. Severe injury may result to a person or object in the line of fire on the opposite shore, several hundred yards away. A .22 LR bullet is capable of traveling , which is more than .

Rimfire bullets are generally either plain lead with a wax coating (for standard-velocity loads) or plated with copper or gilding metal (for high-velocity or hyper-velocity loads). The thin copper layer on plated bullet functions as a lubricant reducing friction between the bullet and the barrel, thus reducing barrel wear. Plating also prevents oxidation of the lead bullet. Lead tends to oxidize if stored for long periods. On a plain lead bullet, oxide on the bullet&#x27;s surface can increase its diameter enough to either prevent insertion of the cartridge into the chamber, or – with high velocity rounds – cause dangerously high pressures in the barrel, potentially rupturing the cartridge case and injuring the shooter; for that reason, standard and subsonic cartridges usually use a wax lubricant on lead bullets.

==Variants==
The variety of .22 LR loads is often divided into four distinct categories, based on nominal velocity:
* Subsonic-velocity: and under
* Standard-velocity: 
* High-velocity: 
* Hyper-velocity/Ultra-velocity: and over

===Subsonic===


Subsonic rounds have a muzzle velocity of less than the speed of sound (about ). These rounds are sometimes equipped with extra-heavy bullets of to improve the terminal ballistics of the slower projectile. Conversely, these rounds may contain little more than a primer and an extra-light bullet.

Subsonic rounds are favored by some shooters due to slightly superior accuracy and reduction in noise. Supersonic rounds produce a loud crack which can scare away animals when hunting. Accuracy is reportedly improved with subsonic rounds because a supersonic bullet (or projectile) that slows from supersonic to subsonic speed undergoes drastic aerodynamic changes in this transonic zone that might adversely affect the stability and accuracy of the bullet.

Because the speed of sound in air at is about , the subsonic round&#x27;s muzzle velocity is slightly below the speed of sound under many hunting conditions. However, under cold air conditions at , the speed of sound drops to , approximately muzzle velocity. Hence, a &quot;subsonic&quot; round used below this temperature may be supersonic, and during the transition from supersonic to subsonic velocity, it may become unstable, reducing accuracy. To counteract this, some cartridge manufacturers have lowered the speed of their subsonic ammunition to or less.

Various combinations of subsonic rounds and semiautomatic .22 LR firearms result in unreliable cycling of the firearms&#x27; actions, as the result of insufficient recoil energy. Some subsonic rounds use heavier bullets (achieving lower velocities) to ensure, as a result of increased bullet mass, that enough energy is produced to cycle common blow-back actions. As an example, the Aguila .22 LR SSS (sniper sub-sonic) round, has a bullet on a .22 short case, providing the cartridge the same overall dimensions as a .22 long rifle round. However, other problems may be encountered: the heavier and longer bullet of the Aguila cartridge requires a faster barrel twist (by the Greenhill formula) to ensure the bullet remains stable in flight.

Two performance classes of .22 rimfire subsonic rounds exist. Some subsonic rounds, such as various .22 short and .22 long &quot;CB&quot; rounds, give about velocity with a bullet providing relatively low impact energy (41 J at muzzle). These may not use any, or only small amounts of gunpowder, and have the characteristics of rounds intended only for indoor training or target practice rather than hunting. Where these are in .22 LR form, it is only to aid feeding in firearms designed for the cartridge, rather than older .22 CB shooting gallery rifles. The Aguila SSS gives about velocity with a 60-gr bullet offering energy (163 Joules) equivalent to many high velocity .22 long rifle rounds using standard 40-gr bullets. Other heavy-bullet subsonic rounds perform similarly and are intended for hunting small game or controlling dangerous animals while avoiding excessive noise.

===Standard velocity===

The velocity of standard-velocity .22 LR rounds varies between manufacturers. Some standard velocity ammo may be slightly supersonic-around , other ammo such as CCI Standard Velocity .22 LR ammunition is rated at . Most standard velocity ammo has a bullet weight of . Standard-velocity cartridges generate near or slightly supersonic velocities. These rounds generally do not develop these velocities in handguns because their short barrels do not take full advantage of the slower burning powder.

===High velocity===

The .22 long rifle round was originally loaded with black powder. The first smokeless powder loads were intended to match the standard velocity of the original black-powder rounds. Smokeless powder is more efficient than black powder, and the cartridge cases could hold more powder. Smokeless powder loads, called &quot;high speed&quot; or &quot;high velocity&quot;, were offered by the major ammunition makers, giving a typical velocity increase of 8% ( to ) while still using the standard solid or hollow-point lead bullet.

===Hyper-velocity===
Many .22 LR cartridges use bullets lighter than the standard , fired at even higher velocities. Hyper-velocity bullets usually weigh around and can have a muzzle velocity of . This higher velocity is partially due to the use of lighter bullets.

The CCI Stinger was the first hyper-velocity .22 LR cartridge and provided a significant increase in velocity and energy over standard rimfire rounds. The Stinger case is slightly longer at &quot;versus&quot; for the long rifle case, but the plated hollow point bullet is lighter and shorter at , giving the same overall length as the long rifle cartridge. This longer case length can cause feeding and ejection issues in some match grade guns. A powder with a slower burning rate is used to make the most use of the length of a rifle barrel. Most .22 long rifle powders increase velocity up to about of the barrel. The powder used in the Stinger increased the velocity in the longest .22 caliber barrel length that is used in testing by the NRA, which is .

Later on, hyper-velocity rounds were introduced by other makers, based on the long rifle case with lighter bullets in the 30-gr weight range and slow-burning rifle powder loadings. The overall length of many of these cartridges was less than the overall length of the standard 40-gr bullet long rifle cartridge. One example is the Remington Viper; another is the Federal Spitfire.

The CCI Velocitor hyper-velocity round uses the standard long rifle case size and a standard weight bullet of proprietary hollow-point design to augment expansion and trauma. This cartridge has a muzzle velocity of and matches the overall length of the standard long rifle cartridge.

===Shot cartridges===

Special .22LR caliber shot cartridges, usually loaded with No. 12 shot, have also been made. These are often called &quot;snake shot,&quot; &quot;bird shot&quot;, and &quot;rat-shot&quot; due to their use in very short range pest control. Such rounds have either a longer brass case that is crimped closed or a translucent plastic &quot;bullet&quot; that contains the shot and shatters upon firing.

===Full metal jacket===
During World War II, a full metal jacket bullet version of the .22 LR was developed as the T-42 for the suppressed High Standard HDM pistol. The US Army Air Corps procured the Savage Model 24 .22 LR/.410 combination gun as an air crew survival weapon included in the E series of survival and sustenance kits, primarily to forage for game for food. The .22 LR full metal jacket bullet ammunition was issued with these firearms for military use to comply with treaty restrictions on expanding bullets. The 1961 Army and Air Force technical manual for small-arms ammunition lists the jacketed cartridge as the M24.

===Tracer===
Tracer ammunition is also available in .22 long rifle rimfire.

==Cartridge construction==
The traditional .22 rimfire cartridges (BB, CB, short, long, long rifle, and extra long) differ in construction from more modern cartridges in the way the bullet is constructed and held in the case. Bullets for traditional .22 rimfires are the same outside diameter as the case but are constructed with a narrower cupped &quot;heel&quot; on the base of the bullet which is inserted into the case. The case mouth is then crimped around the heel, leaving exposed the majority of the bullet bearing surface that contacts the barrel of the gun. The bearing surface of .22 rimfire bullets is often lubricated and the surface is exposed to contamination. This was a common design in the early black powder cartridge era.

In later cartridges, including the .22 Winchester Rimfire and .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire rimfire and modern centerfire cartridges, the bullet body is a uniform diameter and the bearing surface is inserted completely within the neck of the cartridge case, held in place by tension from the case neck around the bullet bearing surface (in some cartridges the case mouth may also be crimped into a cannelure (groove) in the bullet). The heeled bullet cartridge is considered weaker than the uniform diameter bullet cartridge which encloses the bearing surface of the bullet within the cartridge neck. Overall reliability of heeled bullet rimfire ammunition is high, but it is lower than the reliability of most centerfire ammunition.

==Cartridge length==

The .22 long rifle uses a straight-walled case. Depending upon the type and the feed mechanism employed, a firearm that is chambered for .22 long rifle may also be able to safely chamber and fire shorter rimfire cartridges, including the .22 BB, .22 CB, .22 short, .22 long. The .22 long rifle may also be used in firearms chambered for the obsolete .22 extra long.

==Usage==
Today, rimfire rounds are mainly used for hunting small pests, for sports shooting, for plinking, and for inexpensive training. The .22LR is the choice for several shooting events: biathlon, bullseye, plus divisions of benchrest shooting, metallic silhouette and pin shooting, most high school, collegiate, Boy Scouts of America, Project Appleseed, 4H shooting events, and many others. It is also used in the precision Rifle and Pistol shooting events at the Olympic Games. Good quality rimfire ammunition can be quite accurate. The main advantages are low cost, low recoil, low noise and high accuracy-to-cost ratio. The main disadvantage is its low power; it is better suited for use on small game and other small animals.

As a defensive cartridge, it is considered inadequate by many, though the small size allows very lightweight, easily concealable handguns which can be carried in circumstances where anything larger would be impractical. Despite their limitations, people can use .22 LR pistols and rifles for defense, and they are common simply because they are prevalent, inexpensive, and widely available.

Most semi-automatic rifles firing .22 LR cartridges will often only work properly when firing standard or high velocity rimfire ammunition, as the low recoil of subsonic rounds is insufficient to cycle the weapon&#x27;s action. Rifles with manual actions do not have this problem. Due to the low bolt thrust of the .22 LR cartridge, most self-loading firearms chambered for the cartridge use the direct blowback operation system.

The tiny case of the .22 LR and the subsonic velocities (when using subsonic ammunition) make it well suited for use with a firearm suppressor (also known as silencers or sound moderators). The low volume of powder gases means that .22 LR suppressors are often no larger than a bull barrel; the Ruger 10/22 and Ruger MK II are common choices, because of their reliability and low cost, and the resulting product is often nearly indistinguishable from a bull barrel model (although weighing far less). Where firearm suppressors are only minimally restricted, a .22 LR firearm with a suppressor is often favored for plinking, as it does not require hearing protection or disturb the neighbors. Local government agencies sometimes use suppressed rimfire weapons for animal control, since dangerous animals or pests can be dispatched in populated areas without causing undue alarm.

The .22 LR has also seen limited usage by police and military snipers. Its main advantage in this role is its low noise, but it is usually limited to urban operations because of its short range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruger 10/22 Suppressed Sniper Rifle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggests a single head/torso shot suffices, more often than not.

The Israeli military used a suppressed .22 LR rifle in the 1990s for riot control and to &quot;eliminate disturbing dogs prior to operations&quot;, though it is now used less often as it has been shown to be more lethal than previously suspected. Some other examples include the use of suppressed High Standard HDM pistols by the American OSS, which was the predecessor organization of the CIA. Francis Gary Powers was issued a suppressed High Standard for the flight in which he was shot down. Suppressed Ruger MK II pistols were used by the US Navy SEALs in the 1990s.

==Cartridge dimensions==

.22 long rifle maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimetres (mm).

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 406mm (1:16 in), six grooves, land width = 2.16mm, Ø lands = 5.38mm, Ø grooves = 5.58mm.

According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) rulings the .22 long rifle can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.

Because the .22 long rifle round commonly uses a heeled lead or lightly plated bullet, the nominal bullet diameter is larger than the nominal bore diameter to prevent excessive lead fouling that can occur when shooting lead bullets that are the same or slightly smaller than the groove diameter. SAAMI specifies a nominal bullet diameter of 0.2255 with a tolerance of -0.004, while the specified bore diameter is 0.222. In practice, 0.224 or slightly larger bullets are common, with barrel groove diameters commonly around 0.223.

==Muzzle velocity (nominal)==
* lead: .22 LR subsonic
* copper plated lead: .22 LR high velocity
* copper plated lead: .22 LR hyper-velocity CCI Stinger

Note: actual velocities are dependent on many factors, such as barrel length of a given firearm and manufacturer of a given batch of ammunition, and will vary widely in practice. The above velocities are typical.

<text>Johannes Bobrowski (originally &quot;Johannes Konrad Bernhard Bobrowski&quot;; 9 April 1917 – 2 September 1965) was a German lyric poet, narrative writer, adaptor and essayist.

==Life==
Bobrowski was born on 9 April 1917 in Tilsit in East Prussia. In 1925, he moved first to Rastenburg, then in 1928 on to Königsberg, where he attended the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;. One of his teachers was Ernst Wiechert. In 1937, he started a degree in art history at the Humboldt University in Berlin. As a member of the Confessing Church, Bobrowski had contact with the German resistance against National Socialism. He was a lance corporal for the entire Second World War in Poland, France and the Soviet Union. In 1943 he married Johanna Buddrus.

From 1945 to 1949 Bobrowski was imprisoned by the Soviet Union, where he spent time working in a coal mine. On his release, he returned home to his family in the suburban Berlin district of Friedrichshagen, in the Soviet occupation sector of Berlin. He worked as an editor, first for the &quot;Altberliner Verlag&quot;, a children&#x27;s publisher run by Lucie Grosner, and then, from 1959 on, for the &quot;Union Verlag&quot; publishing house.

Bobrowski&#x27;s work was influenced by his knowledge of Eastern European landscapes and of the German, Baltic, and Slavic cultures and languages, combined with ancient myths. His first poems were published during the war, in 1944, in the Munich-based journal &quot;Das innere Reich&quot;.

In 1960 he read his poems at a meeting in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, of the influential West German literary association Group 47 (Gruppe 47). The following year his first book of collected poems, &quot;Sarmatische Zeit&quot; (Sarmatian Times), was published in both West and East Germany. After having missed the fall 1961 meeting of the Group 47, since it took place just after the building of the Berlin Wall, he was able to attend the subsequent meeting, held in October 1962 at the Wannsee, in West Berlin. On that occasion he read seven poems from those that would later appear in his collection &quot;Wetterzeichen&quot; (Weather signs), and was awarded the group&#x27;s prestigious literary prize.

In 1964, Bobrowski became a member of the PEN Club.

Bobrowski died as a result of a perforated appendix in East Berlin on 2 September 1965, and was buried in the Friedrichshagen cemetery. Since 1992, the Foundation for Prussian Maritime Trade (Stiftung Preußische Seehandlung) has donated funds towards the Johannes Brobrowski Medal.

<text>Mystra ( ) is a fictional goddess in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game.

She is the Mistress of Magic and Mother of Mysteries who guides the Weave of magic that envelops the world. She tends to the Weave constantly, making possible all the miracles and mysteries wrought by magic and users of magic. She is believed to be the embodiment of the Weave and of magic herself, her veins the ley lines, her breath the mists and her body the pulsing, thrumming earth.

She is a Neutral Good (previously, and still also, Lawful Neutral) Greater Power. Since the ascension of Midnight, her symbol is a ring of eight stars surrounding a red mist, which flows from the center to the bottom of the ring; however, her older and still commonly seen symbol is a simple seven-pointed star. Her divine realm is Dweomerheart, and her Third Edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; domains are Good, Illusion, Knowledge, Magic, Rune, and Spell.

==Publication history==

=== Creative origins ===
Ed Greenwood created Mystra for his home &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, set in Greenwood&#x27;s Forgotten Realms world.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition===
Mystra first appeared within &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; as one of the deities featured in Ed Greenwood&#x27;s article &quot;Down-to-earth Divinity&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; #54 (October 1981). Mystra is introduced as the Lady of Mysteries, the goddess of magic, a lawful neutral greater goddess from the plane of Nirvana. The article notes that Mystra is a manifestation of the Cosmic Balance, &quot;the natural workings of the multiverse ... a &quot;Great Mystery&quot; ... or a known higher force&quot;, and states that as such she &quot;appears to right great inequalities or goings-awry in the magical balance of things. She appears as a source of light (like a prismatic will-o&#x27;-the-wisp to ethereal and astral view, some say) which uses all spells at maximum level ... Mystra is constantly Shape Changing as far as an observer on any Prime Material plane is concerned. She is said to have given the first teachings that unlocked the forces termed “magic” to the races of the Prime Material plane (and, some say, has forever after regretted the deed). Mystra was made lawful neutral on the premise that magic is inherently neutral, and exhibits internal order and laws. Many mages believe that Mystra determines success in the creation of new spells, potions, and magic items.&quot; Mystra&#x27;s role in the cosmology of the Forgotten Realms is detailed: &quot;Azuth serves Mystra. Mystra and Selûne have a mysterious connection ... and Mystra often works with Oghma and his gods.&quot; Mystra is most commonly worshipped by magic-users of any alignment, and characters working as sages.

Mystra later officially appeared as one of the major deities for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, in the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Set&quot;″s &quot;Cyclopedia of the Realms&quot; booklet (1987).

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition===
Mystra was described in the hardback &quot;Forgotten Realms Adventures&quot; (1990), the revised &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; (1993) in the &quot;Running the Realms&quot; booklet, and &quot;Faiths &amp; Avatars&quot; (1996). Her clergy was further detailed in &quot;Warriors and Priests of the Realms&quot; (1996), and &quot;Prayers from the Faithful&quot; (1997).

Her role in the cosmology of the Planescape campaign setting was described in &quot;On Hallowed Ground&quot; (1996).

Her relationships with the nonhuman deities in the Forgotten Realms was covered in &quot;Demihuman Deities&quot; (1998).

Mystra is described as one of the good deities that celestials can serve in the supplement &quot;Warriors of Heaven&quot; (1999).

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd and 3.5 edition ===
Mystra appears as one of the major deities of the Forgotten Realms setting again, in &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; (2001), and is further detailed in &quot;Faiths and Pantheons&quot; (2002).

Mystra&#x27;s history was included in the sourcebook &quot;The Grand History of the Realms&quot; (2007).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition===
According to the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide&quot; (2008), Mystra has been murdered by Cyric, and is no longer part of the Pantheon. Her death initiated the Spellplague, which is the direct cause of most of the changes Toril has undergone between editions.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition ===
The in-game mechanic to transition the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; from 4th Edition to 5th Edition was called the Second Sundering; this undid the effects of the Spellplague which restored much of the world to its pre-Spellplague state. Mystra is listed as the goddess of magic for the Forgotten Realms setting in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014).

The &quot;Sword Coast Adventurer&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2015), a campaign setting guide, includes information on the worship of Mystra and on her connection with both magic and the Weave.

==Fictional history==
===First Incarnation===
Originally called &quot;Mystryl&quot;, the goddess of magic was a Chaotic Neutral greater power of Limbo within the domain &quot;Dweomertor&quot;, born during the battle between Shar and Selûne in the dawn of time. Being the goddess of magic, spells, creativity, invention, and knowledge, she was said to have taught the first
spellcaster of the Realms. All spells of all types were known to her when their creators constructed them, and her spirit was said to imbue all inventors, authors, songwriters, and artists. She was most venerated by wizards and those who used magic or magical items. She provided and tended the Weave, the conduit that enabled mortals to safely access the raw magic force.

Mystryl was depicted as a beautiful human female with rainbow-colored hair, radiant skin, and burning blue eyes. She wore simple, but elegant, blue-white robes of the finest heavy silk. At other times she was depicted as a vaguely female humanoid form composed entirely of prismatic-hued will-o’-wisps.

According to Ao, Mystryl had ultimate control over all magic and could shape it to her will, and she could withdraw a being&#x27;s access to the Weave and prevent it from using spells of any sort, and in an even harsher restriction she could also prevent a being from using any sort of magic whatsoever if she so decreed. These conditions persisted until she removed them.

Mystryl could even deny deities access to the Weave, but she couldn&#x27;t deny other gods the ability to grant their worshipers spells through prayer.

True to her chaotic nature, Mystryl was flirtatious and profound, flighty and persistent, light-hearted and deadly serious. Her moods and state-of-mind varied from moment to moment, but she generally tried to do what she thought was right. She seemed too trusting and innocent at times, and tended to overreact when she felt she had been tricked. She distrusted but didn&#x27;t hate Shar, who had sought to seize control over her for centuries, and she also rebelled occasionally against the good-intentioned suggestions of Selûne, who she regarded as smotheringly maternal at times. Kozah and Moander, who always seemed intent on ruining that which she created or inspired, were her mortal enemies. Mystryl died when Karsus, wanting to take her place as god of Magic created the most powerful spell ever (12th level spell) and nearly destroyed the Weave. Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the Weave before it was too late.

===Second Incarnation===
Mystra came into being after Mystryl sacrificed herself to save Faerûn from the destruction of Netheril caused by Karsus in DR -339. Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the Weave before the damage became irreparable.:47 When reincarnated as Mystra, she used the form of a peasant girl learning the basics of cantra magic but with the capacities for archwizardry. She recreated the &quot;Weave&quot; of magic with a few more rules, and no spell above 9th level would function.

Priests and priestesses of the new goddess of magic were told the story of Karsus in dreams and visions when they prayed for
spells. It was Mystra&#x27;s attempt to make sure that nothing like this ever happened again. Yet Karsus was accredited as being the only human to have ever achieved godhood through spellcasting, even if it was only for a fleeting moment.

====Mystra&#x27;s Chosen====
Mystra installed the mortal Azuth as the first magister, a position created specifically to recognize her most promising mortal pupil. With the help of Mystra, who had become his lover, Azuth finally ascended to divine status, and also enslaved Savras and Velsharoon. Mystra told Azuth at about the time of the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR) that some of her divine power must be given into mortals, which would slumber within them, so that Mystra could call on it only with their permission. It would serve to help them heal quickly and would stretch their years into virtual immortality, but otherwise it would avail them little. The Chosen might gain some special powers, but these would still be far less than those of a deity.

The Goddess of All Magic accordingly appeared to a few mortals she considered suitable, first in dream visions and then directly, and ultimately invested part of her divine power (known as the Silver Fire) in them. Elminster (who was trained by Mystra personally in the form of one of her own priestess named Myrjala), and Khelben Blackstaff, were two of the first.

====Daughters of Mystra====
It soon became clear to Mystra that most mortals were not tough enough to carry divine power. They either soon withered and died, burnt out by the load they carried, like the elfqueen Aloevan of Ardeepor, or they thrived but were twisted and corrupted by their power, like the mage Sammaster, who began to think of himself as a god and set about building himself a cult of worshippers (which survives today as the Cult of the Dragon). Thus Mystra proceeded to breed her own children, known as the Seven Sisters through the possessing of the Half-Elf Elué Shundar and mating with Dornal Silverhand. Elué/Mystra and Dornal were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR).

The happy couple had a daughter, Anastra Syluné, the following winter (the Year of Laughter, 761 DR), and six other daughters followed one per winter: Endue Alustriel in the Year of the Snow Sword (762 DR); Ambara Dove in the Year of the Sharp Edge (763 DR); Ethena Astorma (later known as Storm Silverhand) in the Year of Mistmaidens (764 DR); Anamanué Laeral in the Year of the Cowl (765 DR); Alassra Shentrantra, who is known today only as &quot;the Simbul&quot; in the Year of the Yearning (766 DR), and Qilué Erésseae in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm (767 DR).

(However, it was written in p. 7 that Sammaster&#x27;s year of birth was &quot;on or near 800 DR&quot;, which was after the seven, and in p. 8 &quot;He then became the first mage to become one of the Chosen of Mystra since the Seven Sisters many years before.&quot; These could mean that her failed relationship/mentorship with Sammaster had nothing to do with her decision to breed the Seven.)

===Third Incarnation===
At the end of the Time of Troubles, Midnight was bestowed Mystra&#x27;s godhood and portfolio by Ao. Midnight adopted Mystra&#x27;s name in order to make peace with her worshippers, and named her mortal friend Adon, a former cleric of Sune, as her head of church. At this time Mystra&#x27;s stated alignment shifted from Lawful Neutral, maintaining the balance in use of magic, to Neutral Good, reflecting the mortal&#x27;s attitudes towards the uses and purpose of magic. Midnight/Mystra retained her home among the clockwork planes of Mechanus. She remained aided in her work by Azuth and Elminster.

In the &quot;Avatar Series&quot;, Mystra was revealed to be a uniquely powerful being. In &quot;Shadows of the Avatar&quot;, she is described as more powerful than any god (save Ao). The major catch is that roughly half of Mystra&#x27;s power lies in her Chosen and in the Lesser Power Azuth; Ao arranged things this way so that Mystra would not rule all Realmspace.

While Mystra might be the most powerful god, that doesn&#x27;t save her from Cyric and Shar, in the year 1385, when the two group together to kill her in her own realm of Dweomerheart, destroying it utterly, and ruining several smaller realms and lesser deities, as said in the final entry in &quot;The Grand History of the Realms&quot;.

===Death===
Murdered by Cyric in the Year of Blue Flame (1385 DR), Mystra is no longer a part of the Forgotten Realms pantheon. The Weave that she controlled and oversaw from her plane, Dweomerheart, burst - as did its counterpart the Shadow Weave. This resulted in the Spellplague spreading across the cosmos.

===Fourth Incarnation===
Mystra returned to the Forgotten Realms in 1479 DR. A vestige of Mystra had survived her death in 1385 DR, and was guiding her Chosen to aid in her renewal. The Simbul was tasked to close multiple rifts in the Weave and between realms. In doing this task, she absorbed much Silverfire and Blue Flame. The Simbul gifted all of that energy to Elminster, who in turn freely returned it to Mystra in a cave within the King&#x27;s Forest of Cormyr. This new Mystra was a combination of the memories of Mystra and Midnight/Mystra, and presumably of Mystryl as she had drawn her memories from the Weave rather than from personal experience.

Mystra&#x27;s return was highlighted as part of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Encounters adventure &quot;War of Everlasting Darkness&quot; by Wizards of the Coast in 2012. She assisted the adventurers in defeating Lolth and her efforts to plunge Faerun into everlasting darkness, which would have allowed the drow to invade and conquer the surface realms.

== Fictional relationships ==
Mystra&#x27;s greatest enemies are Shar, who created the Shadow Weave in response to Selûne&#x27;s creation of Mystryl and the birth of the Weave, and Cyric, who was a mortal along with Mystra and Kelemvor (with whom Mystra had a cold friendship). She was served directly by the Lesser Power Azuth (who was killed during the Spellplague), and indirectly by demipowers Savras and Velsharoon. Mystra also had powerful mortal servants in her Chosen including Elminster, Khelben Arunsun and the Seven Sisters.

===Orders===
*Order of the Starry Quill
:The Starry Quill is an order of Mystran bards who often work as information gatherers and rumormongers for the church or spend part of their time in designated libraries unearthing magical knowledge and then preserving it for posterity.

*Order of the Shooting Star
:The Church of Mystra sponsors an order of rangers, known as the Order of the Shooting Star. These rangers receive their spells from Mystra. They serve as long-range scouts and spies for the church and also deal with magical threats that threaten the natural order of things, such as unloosed tanar&#x27;ri and baatezu and creatures born of irresponsible wizardly experimentation.

*Knights of Mystic Fire
:The Church of Mystra sponsors a knightly order of paladins, the Knights of the Mystic Fire, who are granted their spells by Mystra. They often accompany members of the clergy on quests to locate lost hoards of ancient magic and also form the cadre from which the leadership for the small groups of armed forces who guard Mystra&#x27;s larger temples and workshops is drawn.

=== Weave ===
In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting, the Weave is the source of both arcane and divine spellcasting. Within the context of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, raw magic is characterized as difficult for mortals to access safely. The Weave works to protect the world from the dangers of unrefined magic while giving the ability to cast spells to magic users. Destroying the Weave results in widespread destruction. Reckless use of magic can also damage the Weave, creating areas of dead or wild magic where normal spellcasting doesn&#x27;t work. In ancient Netheril, &quot;Spellcasters are arcanists and do not memorise spells – they merely pluck them out of the weave.&quot; As described in earlier editions, when spellcasters would abuse magic, Mystra could cut off the spellcaster&#x27;s ability to use magic. In addition to the Weave, there is also a Shadow Weave created by the goddess Shar; because Shar is a goddess of secrets, its secrets are kept mostly to herself.

The Weave is present in everything and is inextricably bound to the deity in charge of maintaining it; killing this deity also destroys the Weave. The &quot;Sword Coast Adventurer&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2015) states, &quot;in two senses, both the metaphorical and the real, the goddess Mystra is the Weave. She is its keeper and tender, but all three times the goddess of magic has died or been separated from her divinity [...], magic has been twisted or has failed entirely&quot;. In the history of Faerûn, the Weave has been destroyed multiple times. The first time this occurred was when an archwizard attempted to rob the goddess Mystryl of her power. When he could not handle the power, the Weave became destabilized and Mystryl chose to sacrifice herself, which briefly stopped magic until Mystryl was reincarnated as Mystra.:47

The Weave was then part of Mystra&#x27;s body, who actively willed its effects, until the events leading up to the Spellplague. When Mystra was assassinated in 1385 DR (about a century before the time of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; 4th Edition campaign setting), the Weave collapsed and initiated the Spellplague, leading to several long-standing effects during 4th Edition:

* Realms that had been separated from Toril, the world of Faerûn, returned after millions of years of separation, including landforms from Abeir (a sister world to Toril) fusing with Toril, and the Feywild coming closer in proximity.
* A large part of Faerûn fell into the Underdark, draining the Sea of Fallen Stars and forming the Underchasm.
* Creatures touched by the Spellplague were hideously mutated into powerful monsters or spellscarred beings with special abilities.
* Some deities were slain.
* Most magical portals were rendered inert or malfunctioning.
* Items that permanently store magic and divine magic remained unchanged.
* The goddess Shar lost control of the Shadow Weave.
The Second Sundering (the transition from 4th Edition to 5th Edition) separated Abeir and Toril. This undid the effects of the Spellplague which restored magic and the Weave to its pre-Spellplague state. Curtis D. Carbonell, in the book &quot;Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic&quot;, highlighted the Sundering event as a lore explanation for game mechanic changes. He wrote: &quot;A new sundering was needed to return FR to its pre-Spellplague state. Such complexities are often beyond the interest of many players, but those who choose to unravel them face a historiography and an archive-building challenge of great magnitude. The latest articulation of FR, though, provides a workable solution because it has adjusted itself through the editions, enough so that even 4e can be situated into the multiverse&quot;.

== Reception ==
Mystra was #12 on &quot;The Gamer&quot;&#x27;s 2020 &quot;Dungeons And Dragons: 15 Most Powerful Gods, Ranked&quot; list — the article states that &quot;Mystra is more lawful than her predecessor, and in her reordering of magical law, she outlawed the use of all spells above 9th level, introduced limited access to magic (spell slots), and made spellcasting harder to perform in every way&quot;.

Curtis D. Carbonell, in the book &quot;Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic&quot;, highlighted that major events in the Forgotten Realms occur around Mystra&#x27;s various deaths such as the fall of Netheril &quot;because archmage Karsus attempts to become a god and kills Mystryl&quot; who is then reincarnated into the first iteration of Mystra. Roughly 1400 years later, the Era of Upheaval ends due to the actions of &quot;Shar, the dark goddess who covets Mystra&#x27;s control of magic (the Weave), [who] sets Cyric on a path to kill the ascended Midnight, who had taken the previous Mystra&#x27;s portfolio. Midnight/Mystra&#x27;s death in 1385 leads to the disastrous Spellplague, a 4e mechanism to justify its rule-set and setting&#x27;s changes&quot;.

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken described Midnight in &quot;Shadowdale&quot; as &quot;a mage who wakes up one day with a mysterious silver pendant grafted to her skin&quot; and notes that &quot; When a young waif named Caitlin begs for help rescuing her mistress, Kelemvor, Cyric, and Adon accept, but Kelemvor refuses to allow a woman on the team until Caitlin sees Midnight’s pendant and insists the sorceress come along. It&#x27;s a good thing because Midnight saves their collective asses multiple times throughout the course of the novel.&quot; He notes that in the second half of the novel &quot; Kelemvor and Midnight fall for each other (of course) and he becomes less of an asshole, especially after his curse is revealed&quot;. Bricken points out that &quot;Despite magic being a total mess, Midnight solves so many conflicts with it she repeatedly becomes a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;&quot; and that &quot;While Midnight is practically the only female character in the book other than Mystra, she&#x27;s &quot;never&quot; a damsel in distress; she&#x27;s utterly competent, an excellent fighter in her own right, and drives almost the entirety of the plot.&quot;

Mystra&#x27;s relationship with Elminster has also been highlighted. Aubrey Sherman, in the book &quot;Wizards: The Myths, Legends, and Lore&quot;, featured the relationship between Mystra and Elminster as an example of wizards who receive power and training via a god. Sherman wrote, &quot;his magical abilities, which are considerable, are the result of being one of the Chosen of Mystra, which gives him a direct connection to her and to the magic &#x27;weave,&#x27; [...]. However, when Mystra is assassinated, the result is a collapse of the Weave, an event known as the Spellplague. [...] Because of this, Elminster largely withdraws from the world&quot;. Ari David, for &quot;CBR&quot;, emphasized the multiple trials Mystra puts Elminster through before picking him as her Chosen. David wrote, &quot;He was taught many lessons, including Mystra turning him into a woman in order to gain a greater understanding of the world and a stronger connection to the Weave. He spent years serving as a priestess of Mystra, calling herself Elmara&quot;. Later Elminster would successfully free his home from the ruling magelords, and &quot;though he was the rightful heir to the throne of Athalantar, he abdicated and placed a friend in his stead, having no taste for ruling. Myrjala revealed herself to have been Mystra in disguise all along, there to test him. Impressed by Elminster, she asked him to be one of her Chosen&quot;. Academic Aidan-Paul Canavan highlights that the Chosen of Mystra, such as Elminster, act as an in-game mechanism to protect the status quo of the Forgotten Realms. Canavan wrote, &quot;the Chosen of Mystra act as enforcers that protect the polder, inhibit progress and entrench the boundaries of the fantastic realm. Alternatively the Chosen of Mystra could be considered avatars of the game creators and designers, who themselves actively protect the Forgotten Realms from progress and normally evolving time in order to keep the setting static and stable, with the appearance of tumultuous change and chaos&quot;.

<text>Peter Kipchumba Rono (born 31 July 1967) is a former Kenyan athlete, who won the 1,500 metres at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

==Career==

Born in Kamobo village, near Kapsabet, Rono won the gold medal at the Africa Cross Country Championships in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1985 and in 1986 he was the silver medallist in the 1500m at the World Junior Championships in Athens, Greece. In 1987, he was a semi-finalist in the 1500m at the World Championships in Rome, Italy.

He attended St. Patrick&#x27;s High School, Iten where he was trained by Brother Colm O&#x27;Connell, an Irish Patrician missionary and headmaster of the school at that time.

At the 1988 Olympic Games, Rono managed to closely defeat the main favourites, Peter Elliott and Steve Cram of Great Britain, thus becoming the youngest Olympic Champion at 1500 m (21 years and 62 days).

Rono never won a major race again. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree and master&#x27;s degree from Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University in Maryland, while competing, and later coaching, for the institution.

Peter Rono currently lives in New Jersey, USA where he is employed by the sales and marketing department of the shoe manufacturer New Balance. He is married to Mary Kirui, a runner who won 10,000 metres bronze medal at the 1987 All-Africa Games held in Nairobi, Kenya. They have five children, Irene Rono, Winnie Rono, Patrick Rono, Cynthia Rono and Nosheena Kurui. Their son Patrick Rono attended the University of Arkansas. Their daughter Irene is also a runner.

<doc id="821978" wikidata="Q560266" url="?curid=821978" title="Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec">
<text>Rear-Admiral Yves Joseph Marie de Kerguelen-Trémarec (13 February 1734 – 3 March 1797) was a French Navy officer. He discovered the Kerguelen Islands in 1772 during his first expedition to the southern Indian Ocean. Welcomed as a hero after his voyage and first discovery, Kerguelen fell out of favour after his second voyage and was cashiered in 1775 for violating Navy regulations. He was rehabilitated during the French Revolution. Kerguelen authored books about expeditions and about French naval battles of the American Revolutionary War.

== Biography ==
=== Early life===
He was born in Landudal, Brittany. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Kerguelen-Trémarec was a privateer, but without much success.

=== Rockall ===

In 1767 he sailed near Rockall, or &quot;Rokol&quot;. Although he may not have approached within sight of it, or even within 150 miles, he appears to have had good information regarding it. His charted position for it was only 16 miles north of its actual position and he accurately described its appearance and the nearby Helen&#x27;s Reef: &quot;East of Rokol, ¼ league away, there is a submerged rock over which the water breaks&quot;. In 1771, he published a map of the area. 

=== Discovery of the Kerguelen Islands ===

In early 1772, he was assigned command of the third French expedition sent in search of the fabled Terra Australis with the fluyts &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Gros Ventre&quot;. The expedition discovered the isolated Kerguelen Islands north of Antarctica in the southern Indian Ocean and claimed the archipelago for France before returning to Mauritius. He was accompanied by the naturalist Jean Guillaume Bruguière. On a follow-up expedition to the Kerguelen Islands in 1773, he was accompanied by the astronomer Joseph Lepaute Dagelet. Kerguelen, a supporter of slavery, used &quot;Blacks in difficult moments in order to preserve his white crew&quot;.

In his report to Louis XV, he greatly overestimated the value of the Kerguelen Islands; consequently, the King sent him on a second expedition with the 64-gun &quot;Roland&quot; and the 32-gun frigate &quot;Oiseau&quot;, but was again unsuccessful in finding Terra Australis. By now, it had become clear that the Kerguelen Islands were desolate and quite useless, and certainly not Terra Australis. Upon his return, Kerguelen was court-martialled in Brest on 15 May 1775 by a council of war presided over by Vice-Admiral Anne Antoine, Comte d&#x27;Aché for transporting 200 slaves on &quot;Roland&quot; from Madagascar to sell in French colonies in defiance of Louis XV, who had issued regulations ordering French Navy officers not to trade in slaves. At the court-martial, his defence lawyer minimised Kerguelen&#x27;s slave-trading activities by stating that it was only &quot;Eight or nine negroes that the pilot’s assistant bought on Kerguelen’s behalf&quot;. Although several other naval officers, many of whom were stationed at Rochefort, had traded in slaves, he was found guilty on 25 May 1776 and sentenced to six years imprisonment.

=== French Revolution ===
During the French Revolution, he was seen as a victim of the Ancien Régime and restored to his position, taking part in the Battle of Groix. He died in 1797 as a Rear Admiral and commander of Brest.

<text>Poznań Fast Tram (, PST, informally:PeSTka, &quot;pestka&quot; – drupe, stone fruit) is a stretch of grade-separated tram/light rail line of the tram system in Poznań, Poland. The tracks are set in a cutting or on an overpass, switches allowing to drive on adjacent tracks. The stops, resembling railroad stations, have a different color scheme each. This tram line was created as an alternative to a more expensive metro. The PST, opened in 1997, links the densely populated northern districts of Winogrady and Piątkowo with the city center.

== System ==
* Length: 
* Number of stops: 9
* Maximum speed: 
* Capacity: 5000 persons per hour
* Trams run every 2.5 minutes during the rush hours, otherwise every 5 minutes

== Background ==
Poznań is a city with about half a million inhabitants, with slightly over a million in the entire metropolitan area. Most of the city&#x27;s office buildings are located in the center, while most light industry is located uptown or in the suburbs around the city. Hence most trips by public transport are to and from the center.

== History ==
The first Poznań public transport company started its business activity in 1880, with a few horse-pulled trams. At that time, the town had about 70,000 inhabitants, and was not growing due to building restrictions imposed by the Prussian military administration creating &quot;Festung Posen&quot; (&quot;Poznań Stronghold&quot;), see Poznań in the Kingdom of Prussia (1793–1918).

Soon after the company was established, the construction limitations were lifted, and the town grew very fast to about 200,000 inhabitants in 1920s. By that time there were some early ideas of creating a segregated line that would link the center with one of the northern districts. Neither technology nor the budget allowed for a construction of such a tram line, and metro, would have been too ambitious and unnecessary, so the plans were shelved.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Poland&#x27;s communist government built blocks of flats in the north and east of the city. This created a high population density and thus a high demand for transportation. However, these districts were poorly served by public transport: it took up to 45 minutes by bus to travel to the city center. A corridor was left for the construction of a tram line. 

Original plans envisioned a 27 kilometer line completely separate from the existing tram network, conceptually similar to the WKD light rail line in Warsaw. The line was to run from the main railway station in the city center to Winogrady, Piątków, Morasko and the village of Owińska outside the city limits, with several branches. Ultimately however the project was limited to only a 6 kilometer line in the northern part of the city, joining the existing network in the city center. 

The construction work commenced in 1975, progressed very slowly, finally stalling at 60% in 1990, after the fall of communism. Construction resumed in 1993, and the entire project was ready by the end of 1996.
The line opened on February 1, 1997. Travel times between the northern districts and the center decreased from about 40 minutes to some 10–15 minutes. This, combined with limited and paid parking space in the center, contributed to the huge success of the line, with overcrowding at peak times. 

The tracks originally served three routes, in 1999, a fourth one was added, reaching the limits of the lines capacity with trams run every 2.5 minutes at peak times. As the line has not been fitted with a train protection system, smaller intervals are not allowed for safety reasons.

The trams suffered from vandalism and from a lack of security. These problems, however, diminished when surveillance cameras were installed. The project has had a very positive impact on the communities it serves, making them more attractive for investors, and stopping depopulation.
Some institutions and companies served by the tram, listed by station, include:
(those marked by a plus (+) have moved in the general area after the opening of the line):

* Słowiańska (green) — student dormitories, Courts of Law (+)
* Al. Solidarności (previously Serbska; yellow) — 3 supermarkets (+), a large office building (+)
* Lechicka/Poznań Plaza (previously Lechicka; blue) — a supermarket (+), Poznań Plaza shopping mall (+)
* Kurpińskiego (orange) — a bank (+), a small supermarket, a clinic
* Szymanowskiego (red) — a supermarket (+), and a large development of modern apartment blocks
* Osiedle Jana III Sobieskiego (terminus) — Adam Mickiewicz University campus
In 2011 work began on a previously cut 2 kilometer long extension of the line to the Poznań Główny railway station in the city center, sandwiched between the preexisting tram line running in the city streets and railway tracks. The extension was opened in 2013 with its own turning loop, which allows for operating longer trams sets that could partially alleviate congestion. 

=== Current lines ===
== Future development ==
Similar fast tram networks exist in other parts of the world — namely in Vienna, Amsterdam, and Brussels — while several other cities, beginning with Karlsruhe, have used mainline railway tracks to expand their tram networks. However, those cities are much larger and have gone further towards the development of trams into metro-style, heavier vehicles. It was therefore important for the Poznań administration to find out on their own how successful the program would be.

As the program had proved successful, another new tram line started in early 2005, connecting the city center with eastern district of Rataje. It is not truly a fast tram, but the success of the first program has prompted the authority to convert an existing line into a faster one.

<text>Jean Guillaume Bruguière (19 July 1749 – 3 October 1798) was a French physician, zoologist and diplomat.

== Biography ==
Bruguière was born in Montpellier, France, on 19 July 1749. He was a doctor, connected to the University of Montpellier. He was interested in invertebrates, mostly snails (gastropods).

He accompanied the explorer Kerguelen-Trémarec on his first voyage to the Antarctic in 1773. In 1790 he accompanied the entomologist Olivier on an expedition to Persia, but his poor health didn&#x27;t allow him to continue. In 1792, although he was ill, he visited the Greek archipelago and the Middle East, together with the entomologist Guillaume-Antoine Olivier. He was asked by the French Directoire to try to set up a Franco-Persian alliance, but was unsuccessful, lacking the training of a diplomat. He died on the voyage back.

He described several taxa in his book &quot;Tableau Encyclopédique et Méthodique des trois Règnes de la Nature: vers, coquilles, mollusques et polypes divers&quot; which appeared in three volumes in 1827, long after he had died. He also wrote &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Vers. Vol. 1&quot; (1792) but he had to stop at the letter &quot;C&quot;. Christian Hee Hwass continued his work and wrote most of it.

He died in Ancona in October 1798 (and not in 1799, as mentioned in some sources; there was a discrepancy due to the French revolutionary calendar).

He was mainly interested in molluscs and other invertebrates, as can be seen in the following list of the taxa he named.

<text>Inés María Mendoza Rivera de Muñoz Marín (January 10, 1908 in Naguabo, Puerto Rico – August 13, 1990 in San Juan), was a former First Lady of Puerto Rico, teacher, writer and socialite. She was the second wife of Governor Luis Muñoz Marín. Inés Mendoza stood by the Spanish language, defying the new colonial authorities that wanted to replace it with English.

==Biography==
Mendoza was an accomplished student in her native Naguabo. She graduated in 1927 Magna Laude from the Normal course at the School of Pedagogy of the University of Puerto Rico and in 1931, she received a Bachelor of Science degree from Teachers College, Columbia University in New York, where he specialized in school supervision. She was married to painter Rafael Palacios from 1931 to 1935 and during this marriage they had two children: &quot;Carmen Palacios Mendoza&quot; and &quot;Rafael Palacios Mendoza&quot;.

She returned to Puerto Rico to begin her career as a teacher, writer and newspaper columnist. In 1935, she would meet Muñoz Marín during one of his campaign stops in Naguabo. Although he was married to American writer Muna Lee, Muñoz Marín would move in with her a few years afterwards. They were married on November 16, 1946, a day after his divorce from Muna Lee was finalized. Their marriage produced two daughters, &quot;Viviana Muñoz Mendoza&quot; and &quot;Victoria Muñoz Mendoza.&quot;

In 1948, Luis Muñoz Marín was elected Governor of Puerto Rico. Mendoza lived at &quot;La Fortaleza&quot;, the Governor&#x27;s mansion, for sixteen years. As First Lady, she showed interest in Puerto Rico&#x27;s ecology and public education system. After her husband retired as governor in January 1965, she returned to private life.

Luis Muñoz Marín died on April 30, 1980. &quot;Doña Inés&quot;, as she was known to close friends and family, died a decade after his death on August 13, 1990 at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. A few years after her death, Mendoza&#x27;s daughter, Victoria, attempted an unsuccessful campaign as the candidate for the Popular Democratic Party candidate for the island&#x27;s governorship. She was defeated by Pedro Rosselló, the candidate for the New Progressive Party. Had she been elected, she would have become the island&#x27;s first female governor. That honor would later go to Sila María Calderón when she was elected as the island&#x27;s first female governor in 2001.

The Inés Mendoza high school in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, is named in her honor as well as the junior high school in San Juan&#x27;s rural barrio of Caimito and an elementary school in Yauco. As a teacher, Inés Mendoza defied the U.S.A. imposition of English and ban on Spanish language in Puerto Rico, teaching in Spanish. Her defiance got such a strong popular support that the imposition of English was abolished, as reminded by former governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro García Padilla. http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2014/06/13/actualidad/1402670785_164869.html

<doc id="821997" wikidata="Q4242882" url="?curid=821997" title="Port Krym">
<text>Port Krym (, , - literally &quot;Port Crimea&quot;) is a port in Crimea. It is located on the western shore of Kerch Strait, in the north-eastern part of Kerch city near a settlement of Zhukivka. Next to the port is located the Krym railway station.

Port Krym had the Kerch Strait ferry connection with Port Kavkaz on the eastern (Russian) shore of the strait. The port is also a base for pilot boats which guide navigation through the Strait of Kerch. The port is served by a fleet of three ships which were the property of the Ukrainian State Company &quot;Kerch Ferry&quot; as well as two more ships of the Russian company &quot;ANShIP&quot; which provides railroad ferry connection.

Port Krym was a transition point on the E97 (M17) where it terminated and resumed on the Russian coast at the Port Kavkaz. The type of crossing was ferry, status - local. The types of transportation crossings were passenger and freight.

<doc id="821998" wikidata="Q164079" url="?curid=821998" title="Kingdom of Hanover">
<text>The Kingdom of Hanover () was established in October 1814 by the Congress of Vienna, with the restoration of George III to his Hanoverian territories after the Napoleonic era. It succeeded the former Electorate of Hanover, and joined 38 other sovereign states in the German Confederation in June 1815. The kingdom was ruled by the House of Hanover, a cadet branch of the House of Welf, in personal union with Great Britain between 1714 and 1837. Since its monarch resided in London, a viceroy, usually a younger member of the British royal family, handled the administration of the Kingdom of Hanover.

The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 upon the accession of Queen Victoria because semi-Salic law prevented females from inheriting the Hanoverian throne while a dynastic male was still alive. Her uncle Ernest Augustus thus became the ruler of Hanover. His only son succeeded him to the throne as George V. As he backed the losing side in the Austro-Prussian War, his kingdom was conquered by Prussia in 1866 and ceased to exist as an independent kingdom, becoming the Prussian Province of Hanover. In January 1871, along with the rest of Prussia, Hanover became part of the German Empire upon the unification of Germany. Briefly revived as the State of Hanover in 1946, the state was later merged with some smaller states to form the current state of Lower Saxony in West Germany.

==History==

The territory of Hanover had earlier been a principality within the Holy Roman Empire before being elevated into an electorate in 1708, when Hanover was formed by union of the dynastic divisions of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, excepting the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

After his accession in 1714, George Louis of the House of Hanover ascended the throne of Great Britain as George I, and Hanover was joined in a personal union with Great Britain. In 1803, Hanover was conquered by the French and Prussian armies in the Napoleonic Wars. The Treaties of Tilsit in 1807 joined it to territories from Prussia and created the Kingdom of Westphalia, ruled by Napoleon&#x27;s youngest brother, Jérôme Bonaparte. French control lasted until October 1813, when the territory was overrun by Russian Cossacks. The Battle of Leipzig, shortly thereafter, spelled the definitive end of the Napoleonic client states, and the electorate was restored to the House of Hanover.

The terms of the Congress of Vienna in 1814 not only restored Hanover but also elevated it to an independent kingdom with its Prince-Elector, George III of the United Kingdom, as King of Hanover. The new kingdom was also greatly expanded and became the fourth-largest state in the German Confederation (behind Prussia, Austria and Bavaria) and the second-largest in northern Germany.

George III never visited the kingdom during his 60-year reign. Having succumbed to dementia prior to the elevation of Hanover, it is unlikely that he ever understood that he had gained an additional kingship, and he took no role in its governance. Functional administration of Hanover was usually handled by a viceroy, which during the later years of George III&#x27;s reign and the reigns of Kings George IV and William IV from 1816 to 1837, was Adolph Frederick, George III&#x27;s youngest surviving son. When Queen Victoria succeeded to the British throne in 1837, the 123-year personal union of Great Britain and Hanover ended. Unlike in Britain, semi-Salic law operated in Hanover, prohibiting the accession to the throne by a female if any male of the dynasty had survived. 

Ernest Augustus, now the eldest surviving son of George III, succeeded to the throne as King of Hanover. Adolph Frederick, the younger brother and long-time Viceroy, returned to Britain. Ernest Augustus had a personally-strained relationship with his niece Queen Victoria, and they frequently squabbled over family affairs. Domestically, his reign began with a constitutional crisis as he tried to suspend parliament and nullify the written constitution of 1819. He also presided over the country during the turbulent Revolutions of 1848.

His son, George V, assumed the throne in 1851. In 1866, during the Austro-Prussian War, Hanover attempted to maintain a neutral position, along with some other member states of the German Confederation. Hanover&#x27;s vote in favor of the mobilisation of Confederation troops against Prussia on 14 June 1866 prompted Prussia to declare war. The outcome of the war led to the dissolution of Hanover as an independent kingdom, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and became the Prussian Province of Hanover. In 1871, along with the rest of Prussia, it became part of the German Empire.

After George V fled Hanover in 1866, he raised forces loyal to him in the Netherlands, called the Guelphic Legion. It was eventually disbanded in 1870. Nevertheless, George refused to accept the Prussian takeover of his realm and claimed he was still the legitimate king of Hanover. His only son, Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, inherited the claim upon George&#x27;s death in 1878. Ernest Augustus was also first in line to the throne of the Duchy of Brunswick, whose rulers had been a junior branch of the House of Hanover. In 1884, that branch became extinct with the death of William, a distant cousin of Ernest Augustus. 

Since Ernest Augustus refused to renounce his claim to annexed Hanover, the Bundesrat of the German Empire ruled that he would disturb the peace of the empire if he ascended the throne of Brunswick. As a result, Brunswick was ruled by a regency until 1913, when his son, also named Ernest Augustus, married the German Emperor&#x27;s daughter, Princess Viktoria Luise and swore allegiance to the German Empire. The Duke then renounced his claim to Brunswick in favour of his son, and the Bundesrat allowed the younger Ernest Augustus to take possession of Brunswick as a kind of dowry compensation for Hanover.

The German-Hanoverian Party, which at times supported secession from the Reich, demanded a separate status for the province in the Reichstag. The party existed until banned by the Nazi government.

===Revival and modern history===
With Prussia on the verge of official dissolution (1947), Hanoverian politicians in 1946 took advantage of the opportunity and advocated that the (CCG/BE) revive Hanoverian statehood, reconstituting the Prussian Province of Hanover as the State of Hanover. The state saw itself in the tradition of the kingdom. 

Its prime minister, Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf, played a central role when the state of Lower Saxony was founded just a few months later by merging Hanover with several smaller states, with the city of Hanover as its capital. The former territory of Hanover makes up 85 percent of Lower Saxony and is the origin of its coat of arms.

==Reorganisation of religious bodies==

The Lutheran church was the state church of the Kingdom of Hanover with the King being (Supreme Governor of the Lutheran Church). Regional consistories supervised church and clergy. These were in Aurich, a simultaneously Lutheran and Calvinist consistory dominated by Lutherans (for East Frisia) and the Lutheran consistories in Hanover (for the former Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg proper), in Ilfeld (for the , a Hanoverian exclave in the Eastern Harz mountains), in Osnabrück (for the former Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück), in Otterndorf (existed 1535–1885 for the Land of Hadeln) as well as in Stade (existed 1650–1903, until 1885 for the former Bremen-Verden proper without Hadeln, then including the complete Stade region). A general superintendent chaired each consistory.

In 1848, the Lutheran parishes were democratised by the introduction of presbyteries (, singular ; literally: &quot;church boards&quot;), elected by all major male parishioners and chairing each congregation in co-operation with the pastor, being before the sole chairman. This introduction of presbyteries was somewhat revolutionary in the rather hierarchically structured Lutheran church. 

In 1864, Carl Lichtenberg, Hanoverian minister of education, cultural and religious affairs (1862–65), persuaded the &quot;Ständeversammlung&quot; (lit. &quot;Estates Assembly&quot;, the Hanoverian parliament) to pass a new law as to the constitution of the Lutheran church. The constitution provided a state synod (parishioners&#x27; parliament, ). But its first session only materialised in 1869 when, after the 1866 Prussian annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover, the Hanoverian Lutherans desired a representative body separate from Prussian rule, though it was restricted to Lutheran matters only.

After the Prussian conquest in 1866, on 19 September 1866, the day before the official Prussian annexation took place and with the last , King George V of Hanover, in exile, the Kingdom&#x27;s six consistories joined to form today&#x27;s still-existing church body, the Lutheran State Church of Hanover. An all-Hanoverian consistory, the (state consistory), was formed with representatives from the regional consistories.

While the Calvinist congregations in formerly-Prussian East Frisia had a common roof organisation with the Lutherans there (&quot;Coetus&quot;) and the Reformed Church in the former County of Bentheim, then being the state church, had fully established church bodies for Bentheim only (, ), the Calvinist congregations elsewhere in Hanover were in a somewhat sorry state. Though some Calvinist congregations of Huguenot origin were organised in the &quot;Lower Saxon Confederation&quot; (). The Lutheran church being the state church of Hanover also supervised the Calvinist diaspora parishes outside East Frisia and Bentheim. In 1848 the new Hanoverian law also provided for presbyteries in these Calvinist parishes, which exactly fit the presbyterian structure of Calvinism.

Catholics formed an overall minority in Hanover, but regionally majorities in the former prince-bishoprics. By the annexations in 1803 and 1814 Hanover had become a state of three Christian denominations. In 1824, Hanover and the Holy See thus agreed to integrate diaspora parishes which were located in prevailingly Protestant areas, until then supervised by the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of the Nordic Missions, into the existing dioceses of the former prince-bishoprics, whose diocesan territories were thus extended into the diaspora areas.

Jews lived all over Hanover in diaspora. Until 1806, they were not allowed to reside in some areas. By the Westphalian and French annexations in 1807 and 1810, all-male inhabitants in later restituted Hanover became Westphalian or French citizens of equal rights. On 17 March 1808, Napoléon Bonaparte restricted the rights of Jews in the French-annexed territory by his so-called . The Jewish congregations became subject to French regional Jewish consistories or the , respectively. In 1813, when Hanover resumed independence and sovereignty, its government deprived the Jews their legal equality. Arguing it was the French or Westphalian state and not Hanover, which had emancipated the Jews, the government took the decisions of the German Confederation on the rights of the Jews, in Johann Smidt&#x27;s manipulated formulation, as the legal grounds.

In 1842, Hanover finally granted equal rights to Jews and promoted to build up Jewish congregations, where this did not already happen earlier, and a superstructure of four regional land-rabbinates. These were the Emden Land-Rabbinate (Aurich and Osnabrück regions), the (Hanover and Lüneburg regions), the Hildesheim Land-Rabbinate (Hildesheim region and ), and the (Stade region).

In many diaspora areas Jews regarded this a progress and a burden alike, because of the implied financial burden for rabbis and religion teacher, synagogues or schools. The local authorities now requested that the Jewish congregations establish synagogues and Jewish education for the pupils. The land-rabbins, chairing the land-rabbinates, simultaneously fulfilled religious and state functions, like supervising Jewish elementary schools and the teaching of Jewish religion in all schools. The Kingdom of Hanover was thus one of the few states within the German Confederation, where rabbins held a similar semi-state authoritative position as to Jews as did, e.g., Lutheran clergy towards Lutherans.

==Kings==

In 1813, George III was restored to his Hanoverian territories, and in October 1814, they were constituted as the independent Kingdom of Hanover at the Congress of Vienna. The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 on the accession of Queen Victoria because the succession laws in Hanover, based on semi-Salic law, prevented a female inheriting the title if there was a surviving male heir. In the United Kingdom, a male took precedence only over his own sisters.

==Territory and administrative subdivisions==
The Congress of Vienna instituted a territorial adjustment between Hanover and Prussia to form more contiguous borders. Hanover increased its area substantially, gaining the Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim, East Frisia, the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück, the Lower County of Lingen and the northern part of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. Hanover also annexed territories that had previously been ruled in personal union by its Elector, such as the Duchies of Bremen-Verden and the County of Bentheim. It lost those parts of Saxe-Lauenburg to the northeast of the Elbe, which was assigned in personal union to Denmark, except the Amt Neuhaus. Further small exclaves in the east were lost.

Hanover comprised a number of territories, which had been Imperial Estates within the Holy Roman Empire. Their respective governments, now called provincial governments, were organised according to partially very old traditions, including different levels of estate participation in rule. In 1823, the kingdom was reorganised into &quot;high-bailiwicks&quot; (, singular: ), each led by a &quot;high-bailiff&quot; () according to unitary standards, doing away with the inherited provincial peculiarities.

The high-bailiwicks were subdivided into bailiwicks (, singular ), presided by a bailiff (&quot;Amtmann&quot;, plural &quot;Amtleute&quot;). The high-bailiwicks, named after their capitals, were the following:

* Aurich, comprising former East Frisia
* Hanover, comprising about the former Principality of Calenberg in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg
* Hildesheim, comprising the former Brunswick-Lüneburg Principality of Grubenhagen and the former Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim
* Lüneburg, comprising the former Brunswick-Lüneburg Principality of Lüneburg and the remainder of Saxe-Lauenburg areas
* Osnabrück, comprising the former County of Bentheim, the former Lower County of Lingen, and the former Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück
* Stade, comprising the former Duchies of Bremen-Verden

The Hanoverian subdivisions into high-bailiwicks and bailiwicks remained unchanged until 1 April 1885, when they were replaced by Prussian-style provinces () and districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;).

==Army==

The Kingdom of Hanover maintained an army after the Napoleonic Wars. In 1832, King William IV of Hanover and the United Kingdom issued his troops with British Army uniforms, but they differed slightly from their original British versions. When the personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 and Ernst August ascended to the crown of Hanover, he replaced their uniforms with Prussian Army-style ones, which included the pickelhaube spiked helmet for his Guard Corps.

By 1866 they wore a more Austrian style of uniform, with only the guard corps keeping the Prussian one. During the Austro-Prussian War, the Hanoverian Army fought and defeated the Prussians during its march south towards Austria, at the Battle of Langensalza. However, it was later surrounded and forced to surrender to Prussia.

==Standard, ensign and coat of arms==
After the personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 with the accession of Queen Victoria, Hanover kept the British royal arms and standard, only introducing a new Crown, after the British model. The centre of this coat of arms and royal standard included the original arms of Hanover, which consisted of the two lions of the Brunswick, the rampant lion with hearts of Lüneburg and the horse of Hanover, surmounted by the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire for the Holy Roman office of Archbannerbearer/Archtreasurer. As Hanover no longer was ruled by the British monarchs, the arms of Hanover was simultaneously removed from the British coat of arms and royal standard, so it was no longer identical with that of the Kingdom of Hanover.

<text>Gottfried Achenwall (20 October 1719 – 1 May 1772) was a German philosopher, historian, economist, jurist and statistician. He is counted among the inventors of statistics.

==Biography==
Achenwall was born in Elbing (Elbląg) in the Polish province of Royal Prussia. Beginning in 1738 he studied in the Jena, Halle, again Jena and Leipzig. In the years 1743 to 1746, he worked as controller in Dresden. He was awarded his master&#x27;s degree in 1746 by the philosophical faculty of Leipzig and went in the following to Marburg to work as assistant professor lecturing history, statistics, natural and international law. In 1748 he was called to the University of Göttingen to become extraordinary professor of philosophy, and in 1753 he became an extraordinary professor of law and regular professor of philosophy. In 1761 he again shifted fields, becoming a professor of natural law and politics, and in 1762 he became a doctor of both laws.

In 1765, Achenwall became court counsellor of the Royal British and the Electoral court of Hanover. With financial support from King George III he travelled to Switzerland and France in 1751 and to Holland and England in 1759. He died in Göttingen, aged 52.

In economics, he belonged to the school of &quot;moderate mercantilists&quot;; but it is in statistics that he holds his greatest renown. The work by which he is best known is his &quot;Staatsverfassung der Europäischen Reiche im Grundrisse&quot; (Constitution of the Present Leading European States, 1752). In this work, he gave a comprehensive view of the constitutions of the various countries, described the condition of their agriculture, manufactures and commerce, and frequently supplied statistics in relation to these subjects. German economists claimed for him the title of &quot;Father of Statistics&quot;; but English writers disputed this, asserting that it ignored the prior claims of William Petty and other earlier writers on the subject. Achenwall gave currency to the term &quot;Staatswissenschaft&quot; (politics), which he proposed should mean all the knowledge necessary to statecraft or statesmanship.

<text>Winogrady is a part of the Stare Miasto district of the city of Poznań in western Poland. It is situated north of the &quot;Cytadela&quot; park (the former Poznań citadel). The name refers to the vineyards which formerly existed in the area – historically there were two villages there called Winiary (although &quot;Winiary&quot; today refers to a neighbourhood in Jeżyce district, to which the inhabitants were moved when the citadel fortifications were built in the 1830s).

The southern part of Winogrady, between the streets &quot;ul. Winogrady&quot; and &quot;ul. Słowiańska&quot;, consists mainly of houses, although there are also some apartment blocks (including the &quot;Batman&quot; development, named for its black colour) and student halls of residence. North of this is an area which consists of large estates of apartment blocks, mostly built from pre-fabricated concrete panels from 1968 onwards. Most of these blocks and the estate infrastructure belong to the PSM Winogrady &quot;(Poznańska Spółdzielnia Mieszkaniowa Winogrady)&quot; housing cooperative, founded as a separate entity in 1984 (the development having previously been carried out by the PSM cooperative which now administers only the Piątkowo estates). The Winogrady estates house approximately 43,000 people, about 7–8% of the city&#x27;s population.

The estates &quot;(osiedla)&quot; are called &quot;Osiedle Pod Lipami&quot; (&quot;Under the Lime Trees&quot;), &quot;Osiedle Przyjaźni&quot; (&quot;Friendship&quot;), &quot;Osiedle Kosmonautów&quot; (&quot;Cosmonauts&#x27;&quot;), &quot;Osiedle Wichrowe Wzgórze&quot; (&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;) and &quot;Osiedle Zwycięstwa&quot; (&quot;Victory&quot;). There is also a newer estate &quot;(Osiedle Na Murawie)&quot; to the east of the district. Wichrowe Wzgórze was originally called &quot;Osiedle Kraju Rad&quot; (&quot;Estate of the Land of Councils&quot;, referring to the Soviet Union), and Pod Lipami was called &quot;Osiedle Wielkiego Października&quot; (&quot;Estate of Great October&quot;, referring to the October Revolution); these were renamed after the fall of the communist regime.

For city governmental purposes, the area is divided into four parts, which also called &quot;osiedla&quot;: Stare Winogrady (&quot;Old Winogrady&quot;), Nowe Winogrady Północ (&quot;New Winogrady North&quot;), Nowe Winogrady Wschód (&quot;New Winogrady East&quot;), and Nowe Winogrady Południe (&quot;New Winogrady South&quot;). See Administrative division of Poznań.

The main street &quot;Aleje Solidarności&quot; (&quot;Solidarity Avenue&quot;), formerly &quot;ul. Serbska&quot; (&quot;Serb Street&quot;), runs between Przyjaźni and Pod Lipami to the south, and Zwycięstwa, Wichrowe Wzgórze and Kosmonautów to the north. North of the latter estates is &quot;ul. Lechicka&quot;, a main transit route through Poznań, north of which are a number of similar estates in the neighbourhood of Piątkowo. The Plaza and Pestka shopping and entertainment complexes are located on the south side of this street, in the north of Winogrady.

The Poznań Fast Tram Route (&quot;Pestka&quot;) runs west of the Winogrady estates, continuing northwards to Piątkowo and southwards to the city centre. There are also older tram lines which run from the centre eastwards along &quot;ul. Winogrady&quot; and then northwards, serving the eastern parts of the district.

<text>These are lists of invasive species by country or region. A species is regarded as [[Invasive species|invasive]] if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a native species), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a pest in the new location, threatening agriculture and/or the local biodiversity.

The term invasive species refers to a subset of those species defined as introduced species, for which see List of introduced species.

==History==

Goiás Velho was founded in 1727, its name being a tribute to the Goyaz Indians, the inhabitants of the area before the arrival of the Europeans. Its houses, chapels and churches are testimony to the height of the gold rush era. The history of the town, which is intertwined with the history of Goiás state, and certain reminders of the wealth of past centuries carved in gold, can be seen in places such as the Museu das Bandeiras, built in 1761; the Colégio Sant&#x27;Ana, founded in 1879 by Dominican friars; the church of Nossa Senhora d&#x27;Abadia, constructed in 1790, with its altar painted in blue and gold; and the Casa da Fundição, dating from 1752, where the gold from the mines was cast.

Surrounded by the Serra Dourada, Goiás Velho is the native city of the poet Ana Lins dos Guimarães Peixoto Bretas (1889-1985), better known as Cora Coralina. Although she started writing at 14 years of age, she published her first book when she was 75. In order to survive, she made and sold crystallised sweets. The house where she lived, one of the oldest in the city, dating from 1782, has become a museum, containing her furniture, personal possessions, documents and letters from illustrious correspondents such as the poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade (1902-1987) and the Bahian writer Jorge Amado, one of the main representatives of the literature of the North East region and one of the most widely read Brazilian authors both inside and outside the country.

==Festivals==

In Goiás, one of the most popular festivals is the Procession of the Fogaréu, which occurs on the Wednesday before Easter Sunday. It is one of the most traditional events of Holy Week in Brazil and only in Angra dos Reis is a similar procession celebrated. During the ceremony the farricocos (the people dressed in medieval robes and hoods that accompany processions of penitence) simulate Jesus&#x27; arrest by the Roman soldiers by running through the streets of the town at midnight with torches to the sound of drums. There is a great resemblance with some traditions that take place in Spain at the same time of year especially in Toledo and Sevilla. The darkness, the torches, and the speed of the men with covered faces create a medieval atmosphere. It was believed that the devil was loose in the streets of the town on that night, frightening all, especially the children. Originally, only men could participate but today that has changed. Superstitions like the presence of a werewolf and a headless mule are also manifested in this popular festival. Tourists come from far and wide to witness the spectacle. In 2006, according to the Diario da Manhã a newspaper from Goiânia, 10,000 tourists came to watch the procession.

Another notable festival that happens yearly in the town is the FICA (Festival Internacional de Cinema e Video Ambiental, or International Environmental Film and Video Festival).

<text>Henry Charles Beeching (15 May 1859 – 25 February 1919) was a British clergyman, writer and poet, who was Dean of Norwich from 1911 to 1919.

==Biography==
H. C. Beeching was born on 15 May 1859 in Sussex, the son of J. P. G. Beeching of Bexhill. He was educated at the City of London School and at Balliol College, Oxford. He took holy orders in 1882, and began work in a Liverpool parish at Mossley Hill. He was Rector of Yattendon from 1885 to 1900; Clark Lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1900; professor of Pastoral Theology at King&#x27;s College London from 1900 to 1903; Chaplain of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn from 1900 to 1903; Canon of Westminster Abbey from October 1902 until 1911 and Dean of Norwich from 1911 until his death. He wrote a book on Francis Atterbury.
To him is attributed the popular epigram on Benjamin Jowett:
:First come I; my name is Jowett.
:There&#x27;s no knowledge but I know it.
:I am master of this college:
:What I don&#x27;t know isn&#x27;t knowledge.

This is the first verse of &quot;The Masque of B-ll—l&quot; (1880), a scurrilous undergraduate production in 40 verses satirising Balliol figures. It was suppressed at the time. Later research has given Beeching credit for 19 of the verses.

<text>Carlo Giuseppe Gené (7 December 1800 – 14 July 1847) was an Italian naturalist and author.

Gené was born at Turbigo in Lombardy and studied at the University of Pavia. He published a number of papers on natural history, particularly entomology. In 1828 he became an assistant lecturer in natural history at the university, and in the following year he traveled to Hungary, returning with a collection of insect specimens. Between 1833 and 1838 he made four trips to Sardinia collecting insects.

In 1830 Gené succeeded Franco Andrea Bonelli as professor of zoology and director of the Royal Zoological Museum at Turin. Most of his insect collection is in the Turin Museum of Natural History. Duplicates are in Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano and in Museo di storia naturale dell&#x27;Università di Pisa.

The slender-billed gull (&quot;Larus genei&quot;) was named after him.

<text> (, ) is an Arabic word for a non-Arab, especially a Iranic person. It was historically used as a pejorative—figuratively ascribing muteness to those whose native language is not Arabic—during and after the Muslim conquest of Iran. Since the early Muslim conquests, it has been adopted in various non-Arabic languages, such as Turkish, Azerbaijani, Chechen, Kurdish, Malay, Sindhi, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Kashmiri, and Swahili. Today, the terms and continue to be used to refer to anyone or anything Iranian, particularly in the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf. Communities speaking the Persian language in the Arab world exist among the Iraqis, the Kuwaitis, and the Bahrainis, in addition to others. A number of Arabs with Iranian heritage may have the surname (), which has the same meaning as the original word.

==Etymology==
According to traditional etymology, the word &quot;Ajam&quot; comes from the Semitic root &quot;ʿ-j-m&quot;. Related forms of the same root include, but are not limited to:
* &quot;mustaʿjim&quot;: mute, incapable of speech
* &quot;ʿajama&quot; / &quot; ʾaʿjama&quot; / &quot;ʿajjama&quot;: to dot – in particular, to add the dots that distinguish between various Arabic letters to a text (and hence make it easier for a non-native Arabic speaker to read). It is now an obsolete term, since all modern Arabic texts are dotted. This may also be linked to &quot;ʿajām&quot; / &quot;ʿajam&quot; &quot;pit, seed (e.g. of a date or grape)&quot;.

* &quot;inʿajama&quot;: (of speech) to be incomprehensible
* &quot;istaʿjama&quot;: to fall silent; to be unable to speak
*&quot; &#x27;aʿjam&quot;: non-fluent

Homophonous words, which may or may not be derived from the same root, include:
* &quot;ʿajama&quot;: to test (a person); to try (a food).

Modern use of &quot;ajam&quot; has the meaning of &quot;non-Arab&quot;.
Its development from meaning &quot;mute&quot; to meaning &quot;non-Arabic-speaking&quot; is somewhat analogous to that of the word barbarian (&lt; Greek ), or &quot;Nemtsy&quot; for Germans in Slavic languages, which descend from Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot;, itself from &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;mute&quot;. (From there also comes &quot;(an-Namsa)&quot;, the Arabic name for Austria).

==Original meaning==
The verb &quot;ʿajama&quot; originally meant &quot;to mumble, and speak indistinctly&quot;, which is the opposite of &quot;ʿaraba&quot;, &quot;to speak clearly&quot;. Accordingly, the noun &quot;ʿujma&quot;, of the same root, is the opposite of &quot;fuṣḥa&quot;, which means &quot;chaste, correct, Arabic language&quot;. In general, during the Umayyad period &quot;ajam&quot; was a pejorative term used by Arabs who believed in their social and political superiority, in early history after Islam. However, the distinction between Arab and Ajam is discernible in pre-Islamic poetry. According to the book &quot;Documents on the Persian Gulf&#x27;s name&quot; the Arabs likewise referred to Iran and the Persian (Sassanian) Empire as &#x27; (), which means &quot;Lands of Persia&quot;, and using &#x27; () as an equivalent or synonym to Persia. The Turks also were using bilad (Belaad) e Ajam as an equivalent or synonym to Persian and Iranian, and in the Quran the word ajam was used to refer to non-Arabs. &quot;Ajam&quot; was first used for people of Persia in the poems of pre-Islamic Arab poets; but after the advent of Islam it also referred to Turks, Zoroastrians, and others. Today, in Arabic literature, &quot;Ajam&quot; is used to refer to all non-Arabs. As the book Documents on the Persian Gulf&#x27;s name explained, during the Iranian Intermezzo native Persian Muslim dynasties used both the words Ajam and Persian to refer to themselves. According to &quot;The Political Language of Islam&quot;, during the Islamic Golden Age, &#x27;Ajam&#x27; was used colloquially as a reference to denote those whom Arabs viewed as &quot;alien&quot; or outsiders. The early application of the term included all of the &quot;non-Arab &quot;peoples with whom the Arabs had contact including Persians, Byzantine Greeks, Ethiopians, Armenians, Mandaeans, Jews, Georgians, Sabians, Egyptians, and Berbers.

During the early age of the Caliphates, Ajam was often synonymous with &quot;foreigner&quot; or &quot;stranger&quot;. In Western Asia, it was generally applied to the Persians, while in al-Andalus it referred to speakers of Romance languages – becoming &quot;Aljamiado&quot; in Spanish in reference to Arabic-script writing of those languages – and in West Africa refers to the Ajami script or the writing of local languages such as Hausa and Fulani in the Arabic alphabet. In Zanzibar &quot;ajami&quot; and &quot;ajamo&quot; means a Persian person which comes from the Persian Gulf and the cities of Shiraz and Siraf. In Turkish, there are many documents and letters that used Ajam to refer to Persian. In the Persian Gulf region, people still refer to Persians as Ajami, referring to Persian carpets as (Ajami carpet), Persian cats as Ajami cats, and Persian kings as Ajami kings.

==Pejorative use==
During the Umayyad period, the term developed a derogatory meaning as the word was used to refer to non-Arab speakers (primarily Persians) as illiterate and uneducated. Arab conquerors in that period tried to impose Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Angry with the prevalence of the Persian language in the Divan and Persian society, Persian resistance to this mentality was popularised in the final verse of Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;; this verse is widely regarded by Iranians as the primary reason that they speak Persian and not Arabic to this day. Under the Umayyad dynasty, official association with the Arab dominion was only given to those with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status (mawālī, another derogatory term translated to mean &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot; in this context). The pejorative use to denote Persians as &quot;Ajam&quot; is so ingrained in the Arab world that it is colloquially used to refer to Persians as &quot;Ajam&quot; neglecting the original definition and etymology of the word.

==Colloquial use==
According to Clifford Edmund Bosworth, &quot;by the 3rd/9th century, the non-Arabs, and above all the Persians, were asserting their social and cultural equality () with the Arabs, if not their superiority () over them (a process seen in the literary movement of the ). In any case, there was always in some minds a current of admiration for the ʿAǰam as heirs of an ancient, cultured tradition of life. After these controversies had died down, and the Persians had achieved a position of power in the Islamic world comparable to their numbers and capabilities, ʿAjam&quot; became a simple ethnic and geographical designation.&quot; Thus by the ninth century, the term was being used by Persians themselves as an ethnic term, and examples can be given by Asadi Tusi in his poem comparing the superiority of Persians and Arabs.
Accordingly: &quot;territorial notions of &#x27;Iran&#x27; are reflected in such terms as , , or , the Arabicized form of / (Persia). The ethnic notion of &#x27;Iranian&#x27; is denoted by the Persian words or , and the Arabic term (inhabitants of Persia) or , referring to non-Arabs, but primarily to Persians as in (Persian kingdom) or (Persian kings).&quot;

According to &quot;The Political Language of Islam&quot;, during the Islamic Golden Age, &#x27;Ajam&#x27; was used colloquially as a reference to denote those whom Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula viewed as &quot;alien&quot; or outsiders. The early application of the term included all of the non-Arab peoples with whom the Arabs had contact including Persians, Byzantine Greeks, Ethiopians, Armenians, Assyrians, Mandaeans, Jews, Georgians, Sabians, Copts, and Berbers.

During the early age of the Caliphates, was often synonymous with &quot;foreigner&quot; or &quot;stranger&quot;. In Western Asia, it was generally applied to the Persians, while in al-Andalus it referred to speakers of Romance languages – becoming &quot;Aljamiado&quot; in Spanish in reference to Arabic-script writing of those languages – and in West Africa refers to the Ajami script or the writing of local languages such as Hausa and Fulani in the Arabic alphabet. In Zanzibar and mean Persian, which came from the Persian Gulf and the cities of Shiraz and Siraf. In Turkish, there are many documents and letters that used to refer to the Persians.

In the Persian Gulf region today, people still refer to Persians/Iranians as Ajami, referring to Persian carpets as (Ajami carpet), Persian cat as Ajami cats, and Persian kings as Ajami kings.

==Notable examples==
*The ethnic Persian community in Kuwait and Bahrain are called &quot;Ajami&quot;. The term was initially used to refer to speakers of languages derived from Middle, Old and New Persian (Farsi), and especially those of a Shia background, but considering countries like Bahrain has speakers of various different languages (and especially Iranian languages) it can be seen as a broader term encompassing several ethnic groups, it was also considered derogatory by some, those of a Sunni background (particularly Achomis of a Sunni background) are often intentionally conflated with Huwala Arabs, and sometimes refer to their language as either &quot;Ajami&quot; or &quot;Holi.&quot;
*&#x27;Ajam was used by the Ottoman Turks to refer to the Safavid dynasty.
*The Abbasid Iraq Al-Ajam province (centered around Arax and Shirvan).
*The Kurdish historian, Sharaf Khan Bidlisi, uses the term &quot;Ajam&quot; in his book &quot;Sharafnama&quot; (1597 CE) to refer to the Shia Persians. 
*In the Eastern Anatolia Region, Azerbaijanis are sometimes referred to as &quot;acem&quot; (which is the Turkish translation of Ajam).
*Mahmood Reza Ghods claimed modern Sunni Kurds of Iran use this term to denote Persians, Azeris and Southern Kurds. According to Sharhzad Mojab, &quot;Ecem&quot; (derived from the Arabic &quot;‘ajam&quot;) is used by Kurds to refer to Persians and, sometimes, Turks.
*Adjam, Hajjam, Ajaim, Ajami, Akham (as Axam in Spain for ajam), Ayam in Europe.
*In Turkish, the word &quot;acem&quot; refers to Iran and Iranian people.
*It is also used as a surname.

<text>The National Liberation Army (, ELN) is a guerrilla insurgency group involved in the continuing Colombian conflict, which has existed in Colombia since 1964. The ELN advocates a composite communist ideology of Marxism–Leninism and liberation theology. In 2013, it was estimated that the ELN forces consisted of between 1,380 and 3,000 guerrillas. According to former ELN national directorate member Felipe Torres, one-fifth of ELN supporters have taken up arms. The ELN has been classified as a terrorist organization by the governments of Colombia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and the European Union.

==History==
===Formation===
The National Liberation Army was founded in 1964, by Fabio Vásquez Castaño and other Colombian rebels trained in Cuba. The group included &quot;urban intellectuals&quot; influenced by Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. Later, the ELN was headed by a series of Roman Catholic priests, exponents of liberation theology. Most notable was Camilo Torres Restrepo (1929–66), a well-known university professor (egalitarian and Marxist–Leninist) who was openly critical of the what he considered grossly unequal income among the social classes of Colombia. His attraction to the radical ideas of liberation theology led him to join the ELN, a guerrilla army intent upon effecting the revolutionary praxis of liberation theology among the poor people of Colombia. Priest Camilo was killed in his first combat as an ELN guerrilla, and so became the exemplar ELN soldier, to be emulated by ELN guerrillas and other liberation theology priests from the lower ranks of the Roman Catholic priesthood.

In the years following its foundation, it brought together more students and young activists from cities than peasants, a social composition that distinguishes it from the FARC guerrillas, who are essentially peasants.

In the 1970s, after suffering military defeat and internal crises, the ELN was commanded by the Spanish priest Father Manuel Pérez Martínez (1943–98), alias &quot;El Cura Pérez&quot;, who shared leadership with Nicolás Rodríguez Bautista, alias &quot;Gabino&quot;. &quot;El Cura Pérez&quot; presided over the National Liberation Army as one of its most recognized figures until he died of hepatitis B in 1998. He was instrumental in establishing the ideology of the ELN, a composite of Cuban revolutionary theory and liberation theology that proposes the establishment in Colombia of a Christian and communist regime to resolve the socioeconomic problems of chronic political corruption, poverty, and the exclusion of most Colombians from their country&#x27;s government.

The ELN guerrillas survived the heavy fighting in the Colombian National Army&#x27;s Operation Anorí (1973–74), and then reconstituted their forces, with partial assistance from the Colombian Government of President Alfonso López Michelsen (1974–78), who allowed the ELN to break from and escape encirclement by the Colombian army. President López Michelsen helped the ELN in the hope of initiating peace negotiations with them in order to end the civil war. After this, the National Liberation Army of Colombia resumed financing its military operations by means of kidnap for ransom, the extortion of money from Colombian and foreign petroleum companies and the taxation of the private illegal drug trade of Colombia.

The ELN did not participate in the peace negotiations conducted between the Colombian government of President Andrés Pastrana Arango (1998–2002) and FARC, yet did participate in an exploratory conference about possibly participating in peace negotiations. A Colombian government initiative towards granting the ELN a demilitarized zone in the southern region of the Bolívar Department was thwarted by right-wing political pressure from the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) whose paramilitary mercenaries conduct anti-guerrilla operations in that part of the Bolívar Department.

Peace talks began in 2022, but in August 2024 the Colombian government announced an end to a six-month ceasefire, as the ELN had returned to its practice of kidnapping civilians for ransom.

===First peace discussions: 2002–2017===

====Early contacts====
Previous contacts continued during the early days of the Álvaro Uribe Vélez government but eventually were severed, neither party being fully trusting of the other. Only in mid-2004 did the ELN and the government began to make a series of moves that, with the announced mediation of the Vicente Fox government of Mexico, lead to another round of exploratory talks.

On 24 July 2004 the ELN apparently abducted Misael Vacca Ramírez, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Yopal, though their reasons were not clarified. The kidnappers said that Ramírez would be released with a message, but &quot;Francisco Galán&quot;, a senior jailed ELN commander who has often acted as an intermediary between the government and the ELN&#x27;s high command, said he did not know whether the group was responsible. The Bishop was subsequently released by ELN members, in good health, on 27 July, after his kidnapping had been condemned by Amnesty International and Pope John Paul II, among others. As far as is publicly known, he did not have any message to announce on behalf of the ELN.

Eventually, the ELN questioned Mexico&#x27;s participation in the talks, arguing that it did not have confidence in the actions of a government which voted against Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba during a United Nations vote. This led the Mexican government to end its participation.

====Exploratory talks in Cuba====
In December 2005, the ELN and the Colombian government began a new round of exploratory talks in Havana, Cuba, with the presence of the ELN&#x27;s military commander &quot;Antonio García&quot;, as well as &quot;Francisco Galán&quot; and &quot;Ramiro Vargas&quot;. This was considered the direct result of three months of previous consultations with representatives of different sectors of public society through the figure of a &quot;House of Peace&quot; (&quot;Casa de Paz&quot; in Spanish).

Representatives from Norway, Spain and Switzerland joined both parties at the talks as observers.

The talks ended by 22 December and both parties agreed to meet again in January 2006. After a series of preliminary meetings, the next round of talks was later rescheduled for early-mid February.

During the February talks, which moved at a slow pace, the government decided to formally suspend capture orders for &quot;Antonio García&quot; and &quot;Ramiro Vargas&quot;, recognizing them as negotiators and, implicitly, as political actors. The move was also joined by the creation of what was termed an alternative and complementary mechanism that could be used to deal with difficult issues and matters that concerned both parties, outside the main negotiating table. A formal negotiation process has yet to begin.

On 23 March, the ELN freed a Colombian soldier that it had kidnapped on 25 February, delivering him to the Red Cross, saying that it was a unilateral sign of good will.

The ELN&#x27;s &quot;Antonio García&quot; expected to visit Cuba from 17 to 28 April, participating in different meetings with representatives of several political, economic and social sectors. The third round of the exploratory talks would have originally taken place in La Habana, Cuba from 2 to 12 May.

The third round of talks was later moved to take place from 25 to 28 April.
Both parties reiterated their respect for the content and spirit of all previous agreements, and that they would continue working towards the design of a future peace process. The Colombian government and the ELN intend to study documents previously elaborated during the &quot;House of Peace&quot; stage, as well as documents from other participants and observers. Both parties expected to meet again after Colombia&#x27;s 28 May presidential elections.

On 30 August 2007 the ELN said that in the statement the dialogues in Havana ended without agreement because of &quot;two different conceptions of peace and methods to get to it&quot;.

====Restored negotiations====
Colombian President Álvaro Uribe invited ELN spokesman &quot;Francisco Galán&quot; for new talks about peace on 3 April 2008. The two spoke in the presidential palace. After the meeting Galán says the ELN will return to the negotiation table. The ELN released a press note shortly after that saying the rebel group &quot;does not share the views&quot; of &quot;Galán&quot; and dismissed him as their spokesman. The Marxist rebels did say they will continue to let &quot;Galán&quot; negotiate between the Colombian government and the rebels.

On 7 December, 2008 18 ELN guerillas surrendered to the Colombian army in the northwestern province of Chocó.

In March 2016 the resumption of peace talks between the parties were announced, but were put on hold until the release of all hostages still kept by the ELN. The last hostages were finally released in February 2017 and the talks commenced in the same month, with Pablo Beltrán and Juan Camilo Restrepo heading the delegations of the ELN and the Colombian government, respectively.

On 4 September 2017, the ELN and President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia announced a truce to begin on 1 October and to last at least until 12 January 2018.

From 25 to 29 May the group had a ceasefire so that &quot;those who want to vote can do so peacefully&quot; during the 2018 Colombian presidential election. The ELN said it &quot;reserve[s] the right to defend [themselves] in case of an attack&quot; by security forces or other armed groups.

===Continued conflict: 2017–2022===

====2019 Bogotá car bombing====

On 17 January 2019, the ELN performed a car bombing at the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogotá, Colombia. The truck detonated and killed 21 people, including the perpetrator, and injured 68 others. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The ELN accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.

As a result of the bombing, President Iván Duque Márquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba&#x27;s Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.

====2019 Venezuelan protests====

The &quot;Redes&quot; Foundation denounced in the Colombian Public Ministry that armed groups made up of National Liberation Army members and FARC dissidents, supported by the Bolivarian National Police and FAES officials, murdered two Venezuelan protesters, Eduardo José Marrero and Luigi Ángel Guerrero, during a protest in the frontier city of San Cristóbal, in Táchira state. Other protesters were injured during the shooting.

====2020 ceasefire over coronavirus====
In March 2020, the National Liberation Army (ELN) declared a unilateral one-month ceasefire during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, to start on 1 April.

General Luis Fernando Navarro asserted on 5 January 2021 that the ELN lost 700 members through targeted attacks in 2020, and that it still had 2,500 armed combatants.

===Second peace negotiations: 2022–present===

====Revival of peace talks====
On 21 November 2022, after the election of Gustavo Petro breathed new life into the peace process, delegates of the ELN and the new Colombian government met in Venezuela to resume the peace talks that faltered in January 2019, after the Bogotá car bombing. The negotiations continued into the first week of December 2022, with representatives of the ELN and the Colombian government meeting for the continuation of peace talks in El Ávila National Park in Caracas. On the occasion, ELN chief negotiator Pablo Beltrán stated that Colombians have to work towards reconciliation and recreate a new nation in peace and equity and in a similar spirit Danilo Rueda, the High Commissioner for Peace in Colombia, stated that peace is not only a question of laying down arms, but a process linked to the need for change. Following the conclusion of the first round of talks, the ELN announced a unilateral holiday truce lasting from 24 December 2022 until 2 January 2023.

After Mexico agreed to be an official guarantor to the peace process, it was chosen as the host country for the second round of talks, expected to begin in January 2023.
With the addition of Mexico, along with Cuba, Chile, Norway and Venezuela, there are now five guarantor countries to the peace process.

After misunderstandings arose regarding a bilateral ceasefire between the ELN and the government, an emergency meeting took place on 21 January in Caracas to reassure both sides of their intentions and to set a date for the second round of negotiations, scheduled to commence on 12 February 2023.

Prior to the restart of peace talks, the influential ELN-commander Antonio Garcia criticised the approach of the Colombian government, stating that &quot;the peace process cannot be used as an &#x27;umbrella&#x27; for other issues&quot;. The former commander of the ELN, Carlos Velandia, dismissed this stance as posturing ahead of the next round of talks, which commenced on time in Mexico City, opining that the ELN wants to negotiate its own accord and not be lumped in with other groups.

The Colombian government appointed Vera Grabe Loewenherz as its head negotiator with the ELN in December 2023.

In 17 January 2025 the Colombian government suspended peace talks yet again after a massacre carried out in Tibú due to continuous gunfights with FARC-EP dissidents resulted in around 50 civilians killed.

The U.S. State Department has listed the ELN as a Foreign Terrorist Organization because of its reputation for ransom kidnappings and armed attacks on Colombia&#x27;s infrastructure. In April 2004, the European Union added the ELN to its list of terrorist organizations for those actions and its breaches of humanitarian law.

The ELN&#x27;s main source of income are businesses and middle class civilians in its areas of operation. To enforce these &quot;taxes&quot;, they frequently take civilians captive to use as leverage. While the ELN uses the terms &quot;war taxes&quot; and &quot;retentions&quot; for these actions, critics insist they constitute &quot;extortion&quot; and &quot;kidnapping&quot;.

According to Claudia Calle, spokesperson for País Libre, a Colombian foundation for victims of abductions, 153 hostages had died &quot;in the hands of the ELN&quot; between 2000 and 2007. According to País Libre, ELN abducted over 3,000 people between 2000 and 2007.

==Relations==

===FARC===
The ELN also occasionally operated with the FARC-EP, and like FARC, it has targeted civilians, according to a February 2005 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: &quot;During 2004, the FARC-EP and the ELN carried out a series of attacks against the civilian population, including several massacres of civilians and kidnappings by the FARC-EP. There were occasional joint actions by the FARC-EP and the ELN.&quot;

In mid-2006, mutual rivalries between local FARC and ELN forces escalated into hostilities in Arauca, along the border with Venezuela. According to the BBC, &quot;the FARC have for some years moved to take over ELN territory near the Venezuelan border, and the smaller rebel army reacted by killing several FARC militants&quot;. A statement posted on FARC&#x27;s homepage accused the ELN of &quot;attacks that we only expected from the enemy&quot;.

On 26 May 2008 the ELN wrote a letter to the FARC secretariat, seeking cooperation with Colombia&#x27;s largest rebel group to overcome &quot;the difficulties we are experiencing in today&#x27;s Colombian insurgent movement&quot;. The letter was published on the ELN website. On 27 June 2017, FARC ceased to be an armed group, disarming itself and handing over its weapons to the United Nations.

====FARC dissidents====
According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iván Márquez participated in the talks with the ELN.

===Venezuela===
Since the 1990s, the ELN began to establish positions in the western border states of Venezuela. The ELN grew close to Venezuelan officials during the tenure of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, with Chávez approving relationships with the group.

InSight Crime also states that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that &quot;ELN&#x27;s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration&#x27;s inaction and even encouragement towards the group&quot;; according to the group, the ELN operates in at least 12 of the 23 states of Venezuela. The Venezuelan NGO Fundación Redes has reported that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members. In 2019, ELN supported Maduro during the Venezuelan presidential crisis and said they &quot;will fight&quot; US troops if they invade Venezuela.

====Tupamaros====
The ELN has received support from the Tupamaro movement in Venezuela, a Venezuelan colectivo and political party. The Tupamaro movement supported the ELN&#x27;s dialogue with the Colombian government, stating, &quot;The Tupamaro Revolutionary Movement, now more than ever, stands in solidarity with this sister organization in the historic struggle against the neo-Granadian oligarchy and Yankee imperialism. We strongly ratify all of our support for the guerrillas and the ELN High Command, in the process that is developed with the participation of the Colombian people in the resolution of the armed conflict and the construction of peace with social justice&quot;.

<text>An extended warranty, sometimes called a service agreement, a service contract, or a maintenance agreement, is a prolonged warranty offered to consumers in addition to the standard warranty on new items. The extended warranty may be offered by the warranty administrator, the retailer or the manufacturer. Extended warranties cost extra and for a percentage of the item&#x27;s retail price. Some extended warranties that are purchased for multiple years state in writing that during the first year, the consumer must still deal with the manufacturer in the occurrence of malfunction. Thus, what is often promoted as a five-year extended guarantee, for example, is actually only a four-year guarantee.

Extended warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, &quot;acts of God&quot;, owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and lubrication on a vehicle.

These types of warranties are provided for various products, but automobiles and electronics are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as Best Buy may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of reverse competition. For instance, an auto warranty from a car dealership may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts.

== Overview ==
An extended warranty is coverage for electrical or mechanical breakdown. It may or may not cover peripheral items, wear and tear, damage by computer viruses, re-gassing, normal maintenance, accidental damage, or any consequential loss. Most state insurance regulators have approved the inclusion of normal wear and tear, accidental damage from handling, rental car and towing, power surge and other coverages in addition to the standard coverage for defects in materials and workmanship. The indemnity is to cover the cost of repair and may include replacement if deemed uneconomic to repair. It is important for consumers to read and understand the terms and conditions offered at the point of sale. In retail consumer electronics, extended warranties cost 20% to 30% of the price, and give sales associates up to 15% commission at some retailers.

Consumer advocate groups, such as the non-profit Consumers Union, advise against purchasing extended warranties unless they can be purchased at manufacturers cost. David Butler of the Consumers Union says, &quot;The extended warranty is definitely in the best interest of the company because if the product breaks down they want you to be satisfied with it and buy another one when the time comes, but isn&#x27;t often in the best interest of the consumer unless it can be purchased at cost with no or very little markup.&quot; Consumers Union said in 2006 that only two products deserved extended warranty consideration: projection TVs and digital cameras, as both are expensive to repair and require frequent repairs. In spite of such advice, consumers frequently purchase extended warranties because they overestimate the frequency of failure.

== Extended auto warranty ==
All new cars in the United States come with a warranty that cover repairs for a certain period of time and a certain number of miles, such as 3 years and 36,000 miles. An extended warranty provides similar coverage beyond those time or mileage limits. Legally, only the original manufacturer can &quot;extend&quot; a warranty. Other providers often use the term &quot;extended warranty&quot; to refer to similar products, although technically they should be considered Vehicle Service Contracts rather than &quot;warranties.&quot;

According to the Automobile Protection Association (APA), which publishes the &quot;Lemon-Aid Car Buyer’s Guides&quot;, extended warranties or vehicle service contracts are a good idea if they cover items likely to break down within the coverage period. Extended auto warranties often offer other perks not included in a general factory warranty, such as trip interruption insurance and roadside assistance. Auto warranties generally do not cover vandalism or theft, dings or dents, road salt damage, environmental or natural disaster-related damage, car wash damage, or normal routine maintenance.

Most vehicle service contracts are sold at car dealerships at the time the vehicle is sold, although other providers offer them outside the dealership, often at lower prices.

== By region ==

=== Canadian province of Québec ===
Based upon the Québec civil code and the &quot;Loi sur la protection du consommateur&quot; every merchant is responsible to uphold the legal guarantee of a product. This legal guarantee protects the consumer from: purposefully hidden malfunctions, defaults that could not be readily identified at the moment of purchase, the guarantee that the item purchased can be used for its stated uses and finally guarantees a reasonable life expectancy based on the price paid. This guarantee survives even when the initial purchaser sells his goods to another person. A merchant cannot ask a consumer to pay any fees or shipping charges in order to be eligible to receive their legal guarantee. The office for the protection of consumers does not take a particular stance towards extended warranties. However, they recommend that consumers should be vigilant and question themselves whether the warranty really adds anything to the already applicable legal warranty. Finally they point out that the number of consumers who go to court against merchants in order for them to apply the legal warranty is almost proportional to the number of consumers who take legal means against a merchant for failing to respect extended warranties they have sold.

=== United States ===
In the United States, extended warranties are regulated by many state insurance commissioners as &quot;service contracts.&quot; Service contracts can cover automobiles, consumer goods (such as appliances, electronics, lawn equipment, etc...) and homes. The regulatory structure requires licensure or registration of the warranty providers, financial solvency regulation, and service contract consumer disclosures. Service warranty &quot;providers&quot; apply for licensure or registration, and then may sell their products, usually at the point of sale of the product, for example at the car dealership, or at the retail consumer electronics store, but some companies such as After, Inc, SquareTrade, Warranty Direct and Motoreasy also sell directly to consumers. In the United States, a type of extended warranty called vehicle service contracts are typically regulated by the states as insurance. At one point, California issued a cease and desist letter to several corporations which were selling the insurance illegally in the state; the corporations contended that it was not insurance because the contracts required that certain additives be used.

The Service Contract Industry Council was founded by Fredrick D. Schaufeld and Bernie Schermer in 1988 and is a trade association of members of the industry.

=== United Kingdom ===
The extended warranty market has been subject to several investigations. In 2002 the Office of Fair Trading decided that self-regulation of the industry had failed and passed the case onto the Competition Commission. This concluded that the market was not acting in the interests of consumers. The Citizens Advice Bureau have expressed concerns about extended warranties being mis-sold. The Office of Fair trading investigated the extended warranty market again and published a market review in 2012. They said that the UK market is worth an estimated £1billion a year. Out of this £1billion they estimate 75% of people do not compare prices before buying an extended warranty.

<text>Lucas Achtschellinck (baptized 16 January 1626 – buried 12 May 1699) was a Flemish landscape painter. He is counted among the landscape painters active in Brussels referred to as the &quot;School of Painters of the Sonian Forest&quot; who all shared an interest in depicting scenes set in the Sonian Forest, which is located near Brussels.

==Life==
He was born in Brussels and was possibly the grandson of the landscape painter Lukas Achtschelling. He was registered in the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke on 26 October 1639 as a pupil of a Pieter van der Borcht. The 17th century Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie mentioned that Lucas Achtschellinck also studied with the Brussels landscapist Lodewijk de Vadder but this is not confirmed by Guild records. However, stylistically the two artists are quite close.
Achtschellinck likely travelled abroad after completing his apprenticeship since he only became a master in the Brussels guild in 1657. On 13 March 1674 he married Anna Parys. He remained active in Brussels and in 1687 he was the deacon of the Brussels guild. He was successfully and employed 8 pupils including Théobald Michau between 1659 and 1686.

He died in Brussels.

==Work==
No signed or documented works of Achtschellinck are known, although some monogrammed works are known such as a landscape in the Fondation Custodia and a few works sold at auction. A monogrammed and dated &quot;Extensive landscape with figures&quot; was at Sotheby&#x27;s on 24 April 2008, lot 37. These monogrammed works are typically of a small size. There is still some uncertainty about whether Achterschellinck painted larger format works.
Some large non-marked works (such as the works in the Groeningemuseum, Bruges) have been attributed to the artist. A scholar has reported seeing a photograph of a signed example in a private collection, but this has not resolved conclusively the issue of the attributions of such large-scale works. These large format works are very close to works by Lodewijk de Vadder and Jacques d&#x27;Arthois and may therefore now be in collections where they have been attributed to these other artists.

There are a number of landscapes with a clear stylistic relationship that are attributed to the artist. Characteristic features of his style are the broad brush stroke, especially in the depiction of roads, verges and trees. Similarly, the subtle silvery gradation of light and shade on tree trunks, and especially birches, is a recurring characteristic in the style of landscapes attributed to Achtschellinck.

Achtschellinck was a follower of Rubens&#x27; style of landscape painting and was also influenced by Jacques d&#x27;Arthois. He painted large wooded sceneries for churches and cloisters, which were then garnished by others with biblical characters and events. Achtschellinck painted the landscapes in many of the works of the Antwerp painter Gaspar de Crayer (1582–1669).
Lucas Achtschellinck was among the leading Brussels landscape artists of his time. His presumed second teacher Lodewijk de Vadder (1605–1655) and Jacques d&#x27;Arthois (1603–1686) were other prominent Brussels landscape artists. Lucas Achtschellinck is seen as part of the group of landscape painters active in Brussels which also included Lodewijk de Vadder, Jacques d&#x27;Arthois, Philip van Dapels and Cornelis Huysmans who often depicted the woods and sand banks in the Sonian Forest near Brussels. They are for this reason referred to as the School of Painters of the Sonian Forest.

Lucas Achtschellinck also produced cartoons for the Brussels tapestry workshops. Together with Pieter Bout, Victor Honoré Janssens, Peter Ykens and Lodewijk van Schoor, he designed models for large tapestry series including six models each for the series &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, &quot;Perseus and Andromeda&quot; and for Teniers tapestries.

<text>Apis (; Ancient Greek: Ἄπις derived from &quot;apios&quot; &quot;far-off&quot; or &quot;of the pear-tree&quot;) is the name of a figure, or several figures, appearing in the earliest antiquity according to Greek mythology and historiography. It is uncertain exactly how many figures of the name Apis are to be distinguished, particularly due to variation of their genealogies. A common element is that an Apis was an early king in the Peloponnesus that had a territory named after himself and that Apis was often, but not always, ascribed an Egyptian origin. For the sake of convenience, the variant myths are presented here as if they dealt with separate characters.

* Apis, king of Argos. He was a son of Phoroneus by the nymph Teledice, and brother of Niobe. During his reign, he established a tyrannical government and called the Peloponnesus after his own name Apia, but was eventually killed in a conspiracy headed by Thelxion, king of Sparta, and Telchis.
* Apis, king of Sicyon and son of Telchis.
* Apis, according to Aeschylus was a seer and healer and a son of Apollo. In &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, the Argive king Pelasgus, son of Palaechthon, relates that Apis once came from Naupactus and freed Argos from throngs of snakes, which &quot;Earth, defiled by the pollution of bloody deeds of old, had caused to spring up&quot; and plague the country. Apis &quot;worked the cure by sorcery and spells to the content of the Argive land.&quot; To commemorate his deed, the relieved territory was henceforth referred to as &quot;the Apian land&quot; (&quot;Apia khōra&quot;) after his name. Note that &quot;the Apian land&quot; appears to comprise not just Argos: Pelasgus describes his kingdom as stretching so far as the northernmost boundaries of Greece, and comprising the territories of Paeonia and Dodona.
* Apis, son of Jason, was a native of Pallantium, Arcadia. He participated in the funeral games of Azan and was accidentally killed by Aetolus, who ran him over with the chariot. For the murder, Aetolus was sent into exile by the children of Apis. Apollodorus relates the same of Apis, son of Phoroneus, apparently confounding the two mythological namesakes.

<text>In mathematics, a gerbe (; ) is a construct in homological algebra and topology. Gerbes were introduced by Jean Giraud following ideas of Alexandre Grothendieck as a tool for non-commutative cohomology in degree 2. They can be seen as an analogue of fibre bundles where the fibre is the classifying stack of a group. Gerbes provide a convenient, if highly abstract, language for dealing with many types of deformation questions especially in modern algebraic geometry. In addition, special cases of gerbes have been used more recently in differential topology and differential geometry to give alternative descriptions to certain cohomology classes and additional structures attached to them.

&quot;Gerbe&quot; is a French (and archaic English) word that literally means wheat sheaf.

== Definitions ==

===Gerbes on a topological space===

A gerbe on a topological space formula_1 is a stack formula_2 of groupoids over formula_1 that is &quot;locally non-empty&quot; (each point formula_4 has an open neighbourhood formula_5 over which the section category formula_6 of the gerbe is not empty) and &quot;transitive&quot; (for any two objects formula_7 and formula_8 of formula_9 for any open set formula_10, there is an open covering formula_11 of formula_10 such that the restrictions of formula_7 and formula_8 to each formula_15 are connected by at least one morphism).

A canonical example is the gerbe formula_16 of principal bundles with a fixed structure group formula_17: the section category over an open set formula_10 is the category of principal formula_17-bundles on formula_10 with isomorphism as morphisms (thus the category is a groupoid). As principal bundles glue together (satisfy the descent condition), these groupoids form a stack. The trivial bundle formula_21 shows that the local non-emptiness condition is satisfied, and finally as principal bundles are locally trivial, they become isomorphic when restricted to sufficiently small open sets; thus the transitivity condition is satisfied as well.

=== Gerbes on a site ===
The most general definition of gerbes are defined over a site. Given a site formula_22 a formula_22-gerbe formula_24 is a category fibered in groupoids formula_25 such that

# There exists a refinement formula_26 of formula_22 such that for every object formula_28 the associated fibered category formula_29 is non-empty
# For every formula_30 any two objects in the fibered category formula_29 are locally isomorphic
Note that for a site formula_22 with a final object formula_33, a category fibered in groupoids formula_25 is a formula_22-gerbe admits a local section, meaning satisfies the first axiom, if formula_36.

==== Motivation for gerbes on a site ====
One of the main motivations for considering gerbes on a site is to consider the following naive question: if the Cech cohomology group formula_37 for a suitable covering formula_38 of a space formula_39 gives the isomorphism classes of principal formula_24-bundles over formula_39, what does the iterated cohomology functor formula_42 represent? Meaning, we are gluing together the groups formula_43 via some one cocycle. Gerbes are a technical response for this question: they give geometric representations of elements in the higher cohomology group formula_44. It is expected this intuition should hold for higher gerbes.

== Cohomological classification ==
One of the main theorems concerning gerbes is their cohomological classification whenever they have automorphism groups given by a fixed sheaf of abelian groups formula_45, called a band. For a gerbe formula_2 on a site formula_22, an object formula_48, and an object formula_49, the automorphism group of a gerbe is defined as the automorphism group formula_50. Notice this is well defined whenever the automorphism group is always the same. Given a covering formula_51, there is an associated classformula_52representing the isomorphism class of the gerbe formula_2 banded by formula_54.

For example, in topology, many examples of gerbes can be constructed by considering gerbes banded by the group formula_55. As the classifying space formula_56 is the second Eilenberg–Maclane space for the integers, a bundle gerbe banded by formula_55 on a topological space formula_39 is constructed from a homotopy class of maps informula_59,which is exactly the third singular homology group formula_60. It has been found that all gerbes representing torsion cohomology classes in formula_60 are represented by a bundle of finite dimensional algebras formula_62 for a fixed complex vector space formula_63. In addition, the non-torsion classes are represented as infinite-dimensional principal bundles formula_64 of the projective group of unitary operators on a fixed infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space formula_65. Note this is well defined because all separable Hilbert spaces are isomorphic to the space of square-summable sequences formula_66.

The homotopy-theoretic interpretation of gerbes comes from looking at the homotopy fiber squareformula_67analogous to how a line bundle comes from the homotopy fiber squareformula_68where formula_69, giving formula_70 as the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles on formula_1.

== Examples ==

=== C*-algebras ===
There are natural examples of Gerbes that arise from studying the algebra of compactly supported complex valued functions on a paracompact space formula_39pg 3. Given a cover formula_73 of formula_39 there is the Cech groupoid defined asformula_75with source and target maps given by the inclusionsformula_76and the space of composable arrows is justformula_77Then a degree 2 cohomology class formula_78 is just a mapformula_79We can then form a non-commutative C*-algebra formula_80, which is associated to the set of compact supported complex valued functions of the spaceformula_81It has a non-commutative product given byformula_82where the cohomology class formula_83 twists the multiplication of the standard formula_84-algebra product.

===Algebraic geometry ===
Let formula_85 be a variety over an algebraically closed field formula_86, formula_24 an algebraic group, for example formula_88. Recall that a &quot;G&quot;-torsor over formula_85 is an algebraic space formula_90 with an action of formula_24 and a map formula_92, such that locally on formula_85 (in étale topology or fppf topology) formula_94 is a direct product formula_95. A G&quot;-gerbe over &quot;M may be defined in a similar way. It is an Artin stack formula_96 with a map formula_97, such that locally on &quot;M&quot; (in étale or fppf topology) formula_94 is a direct product formula_99. Here formula_100 denotes the classifying stack of formula_24, i.e. a quotient formula_102 of a point by a trivial formula_24-action. There is no need to impose the compatibility with the group structure in that case since it is covered by the definition of a stack. The underlying topological spaces of formula_96 and formula_85 are the same, but in formula_96 each point is equipped with a stabilizer group isomorphic to formula_24.

==== From two-term complexes of coherent sheaves ====
Every two-term complex of coherent sheavesformula_108on a scheme formula_109 has a canonical sheaf of groupoids associated to it, where on an open subset formula_110 there is a two-term complex of formula_111-modulesformula_112giving a groupoid. It has objects given by elements formula_113 and a morphism formula_114 is given by an element formula_115 such thatformula_116In order for this stack to be a gerbe, the cohomology sheaf formula_117 must always have a section. This hypothesis implies the category constructed above always has objects. Note this can be applied to the situation of comodules over Hopf-algebroids to construct algebraic models of gerbes over affine or projective stacks (projectivity if a graded Hopf-algebroid is used). In addition, two-term spectra from the stabilization of the derived category of comodules of Hopf-algebroids formula_118 with formula_119 flat over formula_120 give additional models of gerbes that are non-strict.

==== Moduli stack of stable bundles on a curve ====
Consider a smooth projective curve formula_121 over formula_86 of genus formula_123. Let formula_124 be the moduli stack of stable vector bundles on formula_121 of rank formula_126 and degree formula_127. It has a coarse moduli space formula_128, which is a quasiprojective variety. These two moduli problems parametrize the same objects, but the stacky version remembers automorphisms of vector bundles. For any stable vector bundle formula_129 the automorphism group formula_130 consists only of scalar multiplications, so each point in a moduli stack has a stabilizer isomorphic to formula_88. It turns out that the map formula_132 is indeed a formula_88-gerbe in the sense above. It is a trivial gerbe if and only if formula_126 and formula_127 are coprime.

==== Root stacks ====
Another class of gerbes can be found using the construction of root stacks. Informally, the formula_126-th root stack of a line bundle formula_137 over a scheme is a space representing the formula_126-th root of formula_54 and is denotedformula_140pg 52 The formula_126-th root stack of formula_54 has the propertyformula_143as gerbes. It is constructed as the stackformula_144sending an formula_1-scheme formula_146 to the category whose objects are line bundles of the formformula_147and morphisms are commutative diagrams compatible with the isomorphisms formula_148. This gerbe is banded by the algebraic group of roots of unity formula_149, where on a cover formula_146 it acts on a point formula_151 by cyclically permuting the factors of formula_85 in formula_153. Geometrically, these stacks are formed as the fiber product of stacksformula_154where the vertical map of formula_155 comes from the Kummer sequenceformula_156This is because formula_157 is the moduli space of line bundles, so the line bundle formula_137 corresponds to an object of the category formula_159 (considered as a point of the moduli space).

===== Root stacks with sections =====
There is another related construction of root stacks with sections. Given the data above, let formula_160 be a section. Then the formula_126-th root stack of the pair formula_162 is defined as the lax 2-functorformula_163sending an formula_1-scheme formula_146 to the category whose objects are line bundles of the formformula_166and morphisms are given similarly. These stacks can be constructed very explicitly, and are well understood for affine schemes. In fact, these form the affine models for root stacks with sections. Locally, we may assume formula_167 and the line bundle formula_54 is trivial, hence any section formula_169 is equivalent to taking an element formula_170. Then, the stack is given by the stack quotientformula_171withformula_172If formula_173 then this gives an infinitesimal extension of formula_174.

==== Examples throughout algebraic geometry ====
These and more general kinds of gerbes arise in several contexts as both geometric spaces and as formal bookkeeping tools:
* Azumaya algebras
* Deformations of infinitesimal thickenings
* Twisted forms of projective varieties
* Fiber functors for motives

===Differential geometry===
* formula_60 and formula_176-gerbes: Jean-Luc Brylinski&#x27;s approach

== History ==
Gerbes first appeared in the context of algebraic geometry. They were subsequently developed in a more traditional geometric framework by Brylinski . One can think of gerbes as being a natural step in a hierarchy of mathematical objects providing geometric realizations of integral cohomology classes.

A more specialised notion of gerbe was introduced by Murray and called bundle gerbes. Essentially they are a smooth version of abelian gerbes belonging more to the hierarchy starting with principal bundles than sheaves. Bundle gerbes have been used in gauge theory and also string theory. Current work by others is developing a theory of non-abelian bundle gerbes.

<text>In Islamic jurisprudence, qiyas (, , ) is the process of deductive analogy in which the teachings of the hadith are compared and contrasted with those of the Quran, in order to apply a known injunction (&quot;nass&quot;) to a new circumstance and create a new injunction. Here the ruling of the sunnah and the Quran may be used as a means to solve or provide a response to a new problem that may arise. This, however, is only the case providing that the set precedent or paradigm and the new problem that has come about will share operative causes (, &quot;ʿillah&quot;). The ʿillah is the specific set of circumstances that trigger a certain law into action. An example of the use of qiyās is the case of the ban on selling or buying of goods after the last call for Friday prayers until the end of the prayer stated in the . By analogy this prohibition is extended to other transactions and activities such as agricultural work and administration. Among Sunni Muslims, Qiyas has been accepted as a secondary source of Sharia law along with &quot;Ijmāʿ&quot;, after the primary sources of the Quran, and the Sunnah.

==Sunni interpretations==
Late and modern Sunni jurisprudence regards analogical reason as a secondary source of Islamic law along with binding consensus, following the Quran, and prophetic tradition. While Muslim scholarship in the later period traditionally claimed that analogy had existed in Islamic jurisprudence since their religion&#x27;s inception, modern scholarship generally points to Muslim scholar Abu Hanifa as the first to incorporate analogical reason as a secondary source of law. Since its inception, analogical reason has been the subject of extensive study in regard to both its proper place in Islamic law and its proper application.

===Validity as a source of law===
Among Sunni traditions, there is still a range of attitudes regarding the validity of analogy as a method of jurisprudence. Imam Bukhari, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Dawud al-Zahiri for example, rejected the use of analogical reason outright, arguing that to rely on personal opinion in law-making would mean that each individual would ultimately form their own subjective conclusions. Bernard G. Weiss, one of today&#x27;s foremost experts on Islamic law and philosophy, explains that while analogical reason was accepted as a fourth source of law by later generations, its validity was not a foregone conclusion among earlier Muslim jurists. Thus, while its status as a fourth source of law was accepted by the majority of later and modern Muslim jurists, this was not the case at the inception of Muslim jurisprudence as a field.

Opposition to qiyas came from a number of angles. Professor Walîd b. Ibrâhîm al-`Ujajî of Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University explains the opposition to qiyas as coming from multiple angles:

:Some of them argued that qiyâs is contrary to reason. One argument given in this light was that: “Delving into this method is intellectually repugnant in its own right”. Another argument was: “Islamic legal rulings are based on human well-being, and no one knows human well-being except the One who gave us the sacred law. Therefore, the only way we can know the sacred law is from the revelation.” Other scholars said that qiyâs is not contrary to reason, but prohibited by the sacred law itself.

Scott Lucas, when mentioning Ahmad Dallal’s position on Salafism, states that Dallal:
:...declared that Salafism &quot;is better understood as a method of thinking of, or an approach to, authoritative sources than as a distinct school of thought&quot; that includes the elevation of the Quran and sound hadith at the expense of the opinions attributed to the eponyms of the four Sunni schools and the rejection (or sever curtailment) of qiyas.

==== Imam Bukhari ====
Imam Bukhari maintained a negative position towards qiyas, as he held views aligned with the Zahiris of his time. Scott Lucas states that Bukhari’s rejection of qiyas was placed within the context of what Bukhari perceived as invalid techniques of ijtihad, which included religious innovation (bid’a), ra’y, and tamthil.

Lucas also points out common mistakes other scholars make when analyzing Bukhari’s position on qiyas. The biggest source of confusion for scholars is the fact that, while rejecting qiyas, Bukhari accepts the idea of tashbih (comparison), which seems similar to analogy. However, this is not the case, as tashbih is a comparison used in explanation (such as a metaphor), whereas qiyas applies a specific legal ruling to another case.

Bukhari is also known for his criticism of those who say that the Prophet used qiyas, and he devoted a section of his Sahih to the topic. Bukhari states:

:If the Prophet was asked about something about which he had not received a revelation, he either said, ‘I do not know’ or did not reply until he received a revelation. he did not [reply] by means of ra’y or qiyas, due to the [Quranic] verse, &quot;…in accordance to what God has shown you&quot; (4:105).

==== Ahmad Ibn Hanbal ====
On Ahmad&#x27;s views, Christopher Melchert states “Ahmad and his fellow traditionalists of the ninth century expressly condemned the Hanafi exercise of qiyas…” When compared with Dawud al-Zahiri&#x27;s intensely negative stance towards qiyas, Melchert also states “Ahmad ibn Hanbal could likewise be quoted, as we have seen, in total rejection of ra’y (opinion) and qiyas (analogy).&quot;

Ahmad ibn Hanbal has been quoted as saying &quot;There is no qiyas in the Sunnah, and examples are not to be made up for it”

==== Support for its validity ====
Early support for the validity of analogical reason in jurisprudence came from Abu Hanifa and his student Abu Yusuf. Al-Shafi&#x27;i was a proponent of analogical reasoning as well, though his usage was less frequent than that of Abu Hanifa.

Acceptance of analogical reason gradually increased within the Muslim world. With the Malikite and Hanbalite schools eventually granting full acceptance as the Hanafites and Shafi&#x27;ites already had done, the overwhelming majority of Sunni jurists from the late period onward affirmed its validity. Japanese scholar of Islam Kojiro Nakamura defined the orthodox Sunni schools in regard to their eventual acceptance of analogy in descending order of that acceptance: Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi&#x27;is, Hanbalis and Zahiris. Much work was performed on the details of proper analogy, with major figures such as Al-Qastallani, Al-Baqillani, Al-Juwayni and al-Amidi from the Shafi&#x27;ite school and Ibn Abidin from the Hanafite school providing rules and guidelines still used to this day.

===Application as a source of law===
Sunni scholar Baghawi gave a commonly accepted definition of analogy in Islamic law: analogical reasoning is the knowledge by which one learns the method of deriving a ruling from the Quran and prophetic tradition. In this case, the above-mentioned ruling should not already be apparent in the Quran, prophetic tradition or consensus. If there is no derivation involved due to the explicitness of the ruling in the Quran and prophetic tradition, then such a person is not, by definition, a mujtahid.

In order for Qiyas to be used in Islamic law, three things are necessary. First, there must be a new case for which the Quran and Sunnah of the Prophet do not provide a clear ruling. Second, there must be an original case which was resolved using a &quot;hukm&quot;, or ruling, from the Quran, Sunnah, or the process of &quot;Ijma&quot;. Third, there must be a common &quot;illa&quot;, or reasoning, which applies to both cases in an analogous way. These three conditions allow for a &quot;hukm&quot; to be made on the new case based on the analogical connection to the reasoning from the original case.

==Shi’a interpretations==
Not unlike the Sunni Hanbalis and Zahiris, the Shi’a rejected both pure reason and analogical reason completely on account of the multitude of perspectives that would arise from it, viewing both methods as subjective. There are various instances in which the Quran disapproves of a divergence of beliefs such as the following:
===Twelver Shi’a===
Within the Twelver Shi’i legal tradition, the fourth source for deriving legal principles is not qiyās but rather the intellect &quot;’’&#x27;Aql’’&quot;. Twelver Shi’a regard the &quot;ulama&quot; (scholars) as authorities in legal and religious matters during the Occultation (&quot;ghayba&quot;) of the Imamah Mahdi. Until the return of the hidden Imam, it is the responsibility of the &quot;ulāma’&quot; to be his deputies and provide guidance on worldly matters. In modern interpretations of Twelver Shi’ism, the most revered and learned scholars are styled as references for emulation &quot;(marja taqlīd&quot;). This system of deriving legal principles effectively replaces both the Sunni notion of consensus &quot;(ijmā’)&quot; and deductive analogy &quot;(qiyās)&quot;

Accordingly, in the chapter on Knowledge of the Twelver collection of prophetic traditions, Kitab al-Kafi, one finds many traditions cited from the Imams that forbid the use of &quot;qiyās&quot;, for example:
===Ismaili Shi’a===
Among the most notable Ismaili thinkers, Bu Ishaq Quhistani regarded the notion of subjective opinion &quot;(qiyās)&quot; as completely contradictory to the Islamic notion of &quot;tawhīd&quot; (unity) as it ultimately gave rise to a countless divergent conclusions, besides which those who exercised deductive analogy relied on little more than their imperfect individual intellects. According to Bu Ishaq, there must be a supreme intellect in every age, just as Muhammad was in his time. Without this, it would be impossible for any ordinary individual to attain knowledge of the Divine using mere speculation. The supreme intellect, he reasoned, could be none other than the Imam of the age.

Bu Ishaq Quhistani referred to the Quranic tale of Adam and Eve to support his argument for the necessity of a perfect teacher who could provide spiritual edification (ta’līm) in place of what he felt were subjective whims and wayward personal opinions (ra’y). Commenting on the Quranic foundational narrative, Bu Ishaq explains that when God taught Adam the names of all things, Adam was commanded to teach the angels, as in sura 2 (Al-Baqara), ayah 33. Spiritual instruction therefore had its root in the Quran itself, however Satan, in his arrogance, refused to bow down before Adam. Instead he protested, &quot;I am better than he. You created me from fire and him from clay.&quot; Thus the first to use deductive analogy was none other than Satan himself, by reasoning and challenging the command of God to prostrate. It was for this reason that Satan was punished for eternity and fell from favor until the final day. In Ismaili thought, therefore, the truth lay not in subjective opinion (ra’y) and analogy (qiyās), but rather in the teaching of the bearer of truth (muhiqq), that is, the Imam of the time. The supreme teacher therefore exists at all times for the imperfect human intellects to submit (taslīm) to, as is proclaimed in the divine dictate:
==Mu&#x27;tazilite interpretations==
Primarily being a school of theology and not jurisprudence, the Mu&#x27;tazila generally did not hold independent positions on such issues. The majority of the Mu&#x27;tazila, despite being a distinct sect from both Sunni and Shi&#x27;ite Islam, still preferred the juristic school of Abu Hanifa, with a minority following Al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s views. This resulted in the odd combination of being Mu&#x27;tazilite in creed but Sunni in jurisprudence, and consequently most of the Mu&#x27;tazila accepted analogical reason in addition to pure reason.

Mu&#x27;tazilite scholar Abu&#x27;l Husayn al-Basri, a major contributor to early Muslim jurisprudence, said that in order for a jurist to perform analogical reason, they must possess a thorough knowledge of the rules and procedures for which allows the application of revealed law to an unprecedented case, in addition to basic knowledge of the Quran and prophetic tradition.

Not all of the Mu&#x27;tazila followed Sunni jurisprudence. Al-Nazzam in particular denied the validity of analogical reason wholesale, preferring to rely on pure reason instead.

== Qiyas and the Inquisition (Mihna) ==
The Inquisition that took place in the middle of the 9th century, which was initiated by the Mutazilite caliph al-Mamun, ensured the persecution of many scholars who did not agree with the caliph&#x27;s rationalistic views. The most famous of these persecuted scholars is Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who maintained his view that the Quran was not created, but eternal.

Wael Hallaq argues that the Mihna was not just about whether or not the Quran was created. The issues of ra’y, qiyas, and rationalism were all represented within the Inquisition, and Hallaq states “The Mihna thus brought to a climax the struggle between two opposing movements: the traditionalists, whose cause Ibn Hanbal was seen to champion; and the rationalists, headed by the caliphs and the Mu’tazilites, among whom there were many Hanafites”

Christopher Melchert similarly argues that the Mihna demonstrated a relationship between the Hanafis of Baghdad, who were associated with the heavy use of qiyas, and the Mu’tazilites.

==Historic debate==
Before the Middle Ages there was a logical debate among Islamic logicians, philosophers and theologians over whether the term &quot;qiyas&quot; refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that &quot;qiyas&quot; refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that &quot;qiyas&quot; does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) and Ibn Qudāmah al-Maqdīsī (1147-1223) argued that &quot;qiyas&quot; refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term &quot;qiyas&quot; refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.

<text>John Stuart Blackie FRSE (28 July 1809 – 2 March 1895) was a Scottish scholar and man of letters.

==Biography==
He was born in Glasgow, on Charlotte Street, the son of Kelso-born banker Alexander Blackie (d.1846) and Helen Stodart. He was educated at the New Academy and afterwards at the Marischal College, in Aberdeen, where his father was manager of the Commercial Bank.

After attending classes at Edinburgh University (1825–1826), Blackie spent three years at Aberdeen as a student of theology. In 1829, he went to Germany, and after studying at Göttingen and Berlin (where he came under the influence of Heeren, Müller, Schleiermacher, Neander and Böckh) he accompanied Bunsen to Italy and Rome. The years spent abroad extinguished his former wish to enter the Church, and at his father&#x27;s desire he gave himself up to the study of law.

He had already, in 1824, been placed in a lawyer&#x27;s office, but only remained there six months. By the time he was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates (1834) he had acquired a strong love of the classics and a taste for letters in general. A translation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, which he published in 1834, met with considerable success, winning the approbation of Carlyle. After a year or two of desultory literary work he was (May 1839) appointed to the newly instituted chair of Humanity (Latin) in the Marischal College.

Difficulties arose in the way of his installation, owing to the action of the Presbytery on his refusing to sign unreservedly the Confession of Faith; but these were eventually overcome, and he took up his duties as professor in November 1841. In the following year he married. From the first his professorial lectures were conspicuous for the unconventional enthusiasm with which he endeavoured to revivify the study of the classics; and his growing reputation, added to the attention excited by a translation of Aeschylus which he published in 1850, led to his appointment in 1852 to the professorship of Greek at Edinburgh University, in succession to George Dunbar, a post which he continued to hold for thirty years.

He was somewhat erratic in his methods, but his lectures were a triumph of influential personality. A journey to Greece in 1853 prompted his essay &quot;On the Living Language of the Greeks&quot;, a favorite theme of his, especially in his later years; he adopted for himself a modern Greek pronunciation, and before his death he endowed a travelling scholarship to enable students to learn Greek at Athens.

Scottish nationality was another source of enthusiasm with him; and in this connection he displayed real sympathy with highland home life and the grievances of the crofters. The foundation of the Celtic chair at Edinburgh University was mainly due to his efforts. He raised almost all £12,000 needed for it. In spite of the many calls upon his time he produced a considerable amount of literary work, usually on classical or Scottish subjects, including some poems and songs of no mean order.

Blackie was a Radical and Scottish nationalist in politics, of a fearlessly independent type; possessed of great conversational powers and general versatility, his picturesque eccentricity made him one of the characters of the Edinburgh of the day, and a well-known figure as he went about in his plaid, worn shepherd-wise, over one shoulder and under the other, wearing a broad-brimmed hat, and carrying a big stick. He was made the first chairman of the Scottish Home Rule Association.

In the 1880s and 1890s, he lectured at Oxford on the pronunciation of Greek, and corresponded on the subject with William Hardie. In May 1893, he gave his last lecture at Oxford, but afterwards admitted defeat, stating: &quot;It is utterly in vain here to talk reasonably in the matter of Latin or Greek pronunciation: they are case-hardened in ignorance, prejudice and pedantry&quot;.

He died at 9 Douglas Crescent in Edinburgh. His death caused great mourning in the city. He is buried in Dean Cemetery to the north side of the central path in the north section of the original cemetery. His nephew and biographer, Archibald Stodart Walker (1869-1934) is buried with him.

Before his death John Blackie gave more than 250 volumes of 19th-century Greek books on various subjects to the University of Edinburgh library.

In 1895, a plaque, designed by Robert Lorimer was erected to his memory in St Giles Cathedral.

<text>The Seville Metro () is an light metro network serving the city of Seville, Spain and its metropolitan area. The system is totally independent of any other rail or street traffic. All stations are provided with platform screen doors.

Line 1 was inaugurated on 2 April 2009. Three more lines are planned to be built. Construction of Line 3 began in 2023 and is expected to be completed in 2030.

The Seville Metro fleet consists of 17 articulated low-floor Urbos 2 light rail vehicles (LRVs) manufactured by CAF. The Urbos 2 LRVs are long, wide, and tall, with a total 6 doors on each side. The capacity of each LRV vehicle is of 192 passengers, of which 60 would be seated and 132 standing. The Urbos 2 LRVs have air conditioning. LRVs are powered by an overhead catenary at .

It was the sixth Metro system to be built in Spain, after those in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao and Palma de Mallorca. Currently, it is the fifth biggest Metro company in Spain by number of passengers carried – over 22.7 million passengers in 2024.

== History ==
=== Original project ===
In 1968, the City Council of Seville already stated that surface transportation was insufficient to meet the mobility demands of citizens due to the growing development of private transport in the area. The Council proposed to build a metro system in the following decade. Seville was then the third Spanish city to plan the construction of a metro-system, after Madrid and Barcelona, which already had metro systems in operation for decades.

On 30 July 1969, the City Council approved a study that received support from the Ministry of Public Works. The Ministry then put out a tender for the drafting of the project, which was selected in September 1972. This first project proposed that the network length would be 27.2 km with 32 stations in three lines, covering only the city of Seville:

* Line 1: La Plata, Puerta Jerez, Plaza Nueva, Plaza del Duque, Alameda, Macarena, Pino Montano.
* Line 2: Santa Clara, Polígono San Pablo, Alhóndiga, Plaza del Duque, Marqués de Paradas, El Tardón, Rubén Darío.
* Line 3: Heliópolis, San Bernardo, Menéndez y Pelayo, Recaredo, Macarena, Cartuja.

Experimental construction began in mid-1974, with definitive construction beginning in April 1976. On 4 November 1981, the monument to San Fernando in Plaza Nueva sank, raising concerns to citizens. A few months later, on 28 March 1982, a sinkhole appeared in Puerta Jerez station, and later that year, some cracks appeared in several buildings in the San Bernardo neighborhood.

Popular local newspapers such as the ABC de Sevilla campaigned against the construction of the metro, citing the system as a threat for historical buildings and monuments because of the &quot;fragile characteristics of the Sevillian soil&quot;. Numerous posters against the construction of the Metro were seen throughout the city during these years.

These events sparked public alarm and encouraged popular opinion to oppose the progress of the metro project, leading to the suspension of the works in 1984 in the midst of a budget restructuring of the newly created Junta de Andalucía, which preferred to build other, more popular infrastructure projects in Andalusia.

By the time the works were suspended, more than 5 billion pesetas (€30 million in 1984, €115 million if inflation is adjusted to 2025) had already been invested. Only 3 stations of Line 1 had been built, with a total length of .

=== Revised metro project ===

In 1999, fifteen years after the works were halted, PSOE and Partido Andalucista reached an agreement to reactivate construction, citing technological advances and considerable population growth as the reasons. A new study project was ordered by the Junta de Andalucía, planning a network covering Seville and its metropolitan area (over 1.5 million inhabitants) formed by four lines, all of them, completely independent of other traffic.

The Junta de Andalucía finally approved the project in 2003, with the aim of promoting railway systems in various areas of Andalusia. Along the Seville Metro, the Andalusian Government also planned the construction of Málaga Metro (opened 2014), Granada Metro (2017), Cádiz Bay tram-train (2022) and Jaén Tram (yet to be inaugurated).

Construction of Line 1 began in September 2003, starting with the rehabilitation of the flooded Nervion station, whose works were halted 25 years prior. The line was scheduled to be completed in 2006, but construction was still halfway done by then. In October 2007, Metrocentro tram system was inaugurated. The Junta de Andalucía temporarily transferred five Urbos 2 trams to TUSSAM (operator of city buses and MetroCentro) since the metro system was not still operating. A few months later, TUSSAM bought the trams, which were eventually brought back to their manufacturer, CAF, and sold once again to the Seville Metro in 2010.

The inauguration day was expected to be 21 December 2008. However, on 27 November, a water filtration at Puerta Jerez station delayed the inauguration by three and a half months. Line 1 finally began operation on 2 April 2009.
=== Enlargement ===

After Line 1 was inaugurated in 2009, Seville Metro projects were halted due to the global financial crisis that severely struck Spain. Over the following years, projects for the construction of new lines were requested, but they were never completed.

In 2018, government officials came to an agreement to build line 3 of the metro system next, as this line would only cross the city of Seville, thus requiring less permissions. Line 3 officially began construction in February 2023, although just the northern half of it, since the southern half still does not have an approved project. Line 3 is expected to be inaugurated in 2030.

In October 2024, Seville Metro updated its logo and corporate image.

== System ==
=== Line 1 ===
* Line 1, West-South
** Cities: Mairena del Aljarafe, San Juan de Aznalfarache, Seville, Dos Hermanas.
** Stations: 22
** Length: 
** Construction: September 2003 - April 2009
** Licence holder: Grupo ACS, Grupo SyV, GEA 21, AOPJA, CAF

Line 1 of Seville Metro crosses the southern part of Seville metropolitan area, starting at Ciudad Expo station in Mairena del Aljarafe. The end of the line is Olivar de Quintos in Montequinto, a neighborhood of Dos Hermanas. The line crosses the busiest zones in Seville, including Puerta Jerez near Seville city center, San Bernardo, which is a transportation hub, and Nervión. The line also stops at Pablo de Olavide University, where it is expected to have a connection to the Alcalá de Guadaira tramway in 2026.

In 2019 the busiest stations on Line 1 were Puerta Jerez (2,139,000), San Bernardo (1,393,000) and Nervión (1,385,000).

== Fares ==
There are several payment methods that can be used in the metro facilities.
* An exclusive Seville Metro ticket: they can be bought at automated ticket machines in stations.
* A Seville Metro card
* A multimodal card of the Transport Consortium of any Metropolitan Area of Andalusia.
* Bank card using the Tap&amp;Go system.

<doc id="822063" wikidata="Q778868" url="?curid=822063" title="Phalen maneuver">
<text>Phalen&#x27;s maneuver is a diagnostic test for carpal tunnel syndrome by an American orthopedist named George S. Phalen.

==Technique==
The patient is asked to hold their wrists in complete and forced flexion (pushing the dorsal surfaces of both hands together) for 30–60 seconds. The lumbricals attach in part to the flexor digitorum profundus tendons. As the wrists flex, the flexor digitorum profundus contracts in a proximal direction, drawing the lumbricals along with it. 

In some individuals, the lumbricals can be &quot;dragged&quot; into the carpal tunnel with flexor digitorum profundus contraction. As such, Phalen&#x27;s maneuver can moderately increase the pressure in the carpal tunnel via this mass effect, pinching the median nerve between the proximal edge of the transverse carpal ligament and the anterior border of the distal end of the radius. 

By compressing the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, characteristic symptoms (such as burning, tingling or numb sensation over the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers) convey a positive test result and suggest carpal tunnel syndrome. Because not all individuals will draw the lumbricals into the carpal tunnel with this maneuver, this test cannot be perfectly sensitive or specific for carpal tunnel syndrome.

==Accuracy==
In studies of diagnostic accuracy, the sensitivity of the Phalen&#x27;s maneuver ranged from 51% to 91% and its specificity from 33% to 88%.

==Reverse Phalen&#x27;s test==

This test is performed by having the patient maintain full wrist and finger extension for two minutes. The reverse Phalen&#x27;s test significantly increases pressure in the carpal tunnel within 10 seconds of the change in wrist posture and the carpal tunnel pressure has the tendency to increase throughout the test&#x27;s duration. In contrast, the change in carpal tunnel pressure noted in the standard Phalen&#x27;s test is modest and plateaus after 20 to 30 seconds.

The average pressure change for Phalen&#x27;s test at one and two minutes was only 4 mm Hg. The average pressure changes in the carpal tunnel for the reverse Phalen&#x27;s test were 34 mm Hg at one minute into the test and 42 mm Hg at the two-minute point.

The extended wrist posture significantly changes the pressure within the carpal tunnel and may be more useful as a provocative examination maneuver. Reverse Phalen&#x27;s maneuver results in a significantly higher intracarpal canal hydrostatic pressure as compared to a traditional Phalen&#x27;s. This is thought to add to the sensitivity of conventional screening methods.

==Comparison==
Phalen&#x27;s maneuver is more sensitive than Tinel&#x27;s sign.

<text>For All You&#x27;ve Done is the thirteenth album in the live praise and worship series of contemporary worship music by Hillsong Church. The live album was released on 4 July 2004 on Hillsong label, which peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It had been recorded in February of that year at the Sydney Entertainment Centre with production by Darlene Zschech, Raymond Badham, Joel Houston and Reuben Morgan.

==Recording==

&quot;For All You&#x27;ve Done&quot; was recorded live at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on 29 February 2004 by Darlene Zschech and the Hillsong team.

==Commercial performance==
However, its previous two albums debuted in the top five due to the strong following of Hillsong and its previous 12 albums have achieved gold status. It is the first Christian Contemporary music album to reach the top of the Australian charts.

There was some controversy about the No. 1 debut as almost all of the albums were sold at the annual Hillsong Conference from 5 to 9 July. However, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) has defended the outcome on the grounds that &quot;For All You&#x27;ve Done&quot; was the best selling album in Australia that week. Pop singer and former &quot;Australian Idol&quot; contestant Paulini Curuenavuli was also at the conference promoting her No. 2 single, &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, from her forthcoming album, &quot;One Determined Heart&quot;.

<text>Markyate () is a village and civil parish in north-west Hertfordshire, close to the border with Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

==Geography==
The name of the village has had several former variants, including &quot;Markyate Street&quot;, &quot;Market Street&quot; and &quot;Mergyate&quot;. Markyate historically straddled Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire until boundary changes in 1897 placed it entirely in Hertfordshire. Markyate is close to the source of the River Ver, which has occasionally flooded the centre of the village, though the watercourse is often dry during parts of the year.

Markyate forms part of the borough of Dacorum (administered from Hemel Hempstead), but has Luton (01582) phone numbers and a St Albans postal code (AL3). Although historically a rural and agricultural area, it is now a dormitory village for Luton and the surrounding region, as it is a short distance from junction 9 of the M1 motorway.

The village lies near the junction of the A5183 Watling Street (formerly the A5 until de-trunking) and the B4540 (for Luton and Caddington). A bypass for the A5 was constructed to the east of the village in 1955.

==History==
Markyate lies on the Roman road of Watling Street, approximately halfway between St Albans and Dunstable. Through the village Watling Street is called High Street.

A Benedictine convent was founded in 1145 in a wood just north of Markyate, which was known as both &quot;Holy Trinity in the Wood&quot; and Markyate Priory. The first prioress was Christina of Markyate. The priory was dissolved around 1537, following the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535. Shortly after the priory&#x27;s dissolution a large country house was built on the site, called Markyate Cell, and now known as Cell Park.

Markyate&#x27;s position on Watling Street made it a coaching stop on the stagecoach routes from London to Birmingham and Holyhead, especially after the road was upgraded by Thomas Telford in the early 1800s, when it became known as the Holyhead Road. At one point Markyate had over forty inns and public houses along the main road.

The village was one of the earliest sites of the Pickfords transport service. One road in the village is now called Pickford Road.

Growth since the 1950s has been by infilling with new housing in the gap between the High Street and the newer Markyate by-pass. In 2014 most of the village&#x27;s light industry area off Hicks Road was demolished, to be replaced by new housing and shops.

==Governance==
Markyate historically straddled three parishes and two counties. The southern part of the village (south of Buckwood Road and Hicks Road) was in the parish of Flamstead in Hertfordshire. The north-eastern part of the village (east of High Street and north of Hicks Road) was in the part of the parish of Caddington which was in Hertfordshire. The north-western part of the village (west of High Street and north of Buckwood Road) was in a detached part of the parish of Studham, known as Humbershoe. Humbershoe became a separate civil parish in 1866, although remained part of the ecclesiastical parish of Studham. When Poor Law Unions were established in 1835, the parish of Flamstead was included in the Hemel Hempstead Poor Law Union, whilst Caddington and Studham parishes were included in the Luton Poor Law Union, meaning that the poor from Markyate were sent to either Hemel Hempstead or Luton workhouses depending on where in the village they lived.

An ecclesiastical parish was created on 30 October 1877, called &quot;St John Markyate Street&quot;, covering parts of the parishes of Caddington, Flamstead, Studham (Humbershoe) and an exclave of Houghton Regis known as Buckwood Stubbs, which was a rural area to the north-west of the village. A chapel dedicated to St John the Baptist had been built in 1734 on the edge of the Markyate Cell estate as a chapel of ease to Caddington, and it became the parish church of the new ecclesiastical parish.

Proposals to change the civil boundaries to match the ecclesiastical parish were put forward in 1888, but not implemented at that time. When district councils were established in December 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894, the ecclesiastical parish of Markyate found itself straddling three districts: Markyate Rural District, which despite the name only covered the parts of the village in the civil parish of Caddington, Hemel Hempstead Rural District covering the parts of the village in Flamstead, and Luton Rural District covering the parts of the village in Humbershoe and Houghton Regis civil parishes. This gave rise to confusion, with one candidate&#x27;s nomination at the election in December 1894 being invalid for assuming that Humbershoe was in the Markyate district, when it was in the Luton district.

An inquiry was held at Luton in February 1896 into a proposal to create a civil parish to match the ecclesiastical parish of Markyate and make other changes to rationalise the border between Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire in this area. As an illustration of the absurdity of the existing arrangements in Markyate, it was said that dogs did not have to be muzzled on one side of the road, but they did on the other. There was general agreement that Markyate should be brought into a single parish and district, but some debate as to whether it should be placed in the Luton Rural District in Bedfordshire or the Hemel Hempstead Rural District in Hertfordshire. Eventually it was decided to place the new civil parish in Hemel Hempstead Rural District in Hertfordshire. The changes came into effect on 30 September 1897, with Markyate then being united as a single civil parish entirely in Hertfordshire.

The first meeting of Markyate Parish Council was held on 10 November 1897 in the village school. Frederick William Partridge, a Liberal, was elected the first chairman of the parish council. He had previously been the chairman of the Markyate Rural District Council.

The Hemel Hempstead Rural District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and since 1 April 1974 the civil parish of Markyate has formed part of the district of Dacorum (which gained borough status in 1984).

==In popular culture==

The Gainsborough film &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; was based on events surrounding the life of Lady Katherine Ferrers — the wife of the major landowner in the area – at Markyate Cell. Parts of the film &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; were also filmed in the village and surrounding area, the stockade being built in the grounds of the local preparatory school.

==Facilities==

Markyate has two junior schools: Markyate JMI (state) and Beechwood Park School (independent). The latter is south-west of the village in Beechwood Park, the site of a former Benedictine nunnery. Adjacent to the park was an Army Y-station during the Second World War. Beechwood Park lent its name to a song by the Zombies, written by the group&#x27;s bassist Chris White. The song has since been covered by Beck in live shows.

The parish church of St John Markyate dates from the 18th century, and retains some round-arched windows from that time. Due to enlargement in the nineteenth century it now appears gothic from most directions. St John&#x27;s is home to a worshipping community of the Church of England and is part of the united parish of Flamstead and Markyate.

From its height in the coaching era, only two public houses now remain in the village: the Plume of Feathers and the Swan. The White Hart closed in the early 1970s, followed by the Red Lion at the end of 2009 and Sun Inn in 2014, all of which became private dwellings.

Markyate has four Indian restaurants including &quot;Saffron&quot; (on the A5183) plus &quot;The Pavilion&quot;, &quot;Markyate Tandoori&quot;, and &quot;Markyate Spice&quot; all on the High Street, with the latter being named Best Chef at the Curry Life Awards 2018. There has also been a fish and chips shop in the village since the 1960s.

Markyate also offers a gym, a pharmacy and doctors&#x27; surgery, a general store, and a bakers.

<doc id="822074" wikidata="Q4928223" url="?curid=822074" title="Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)">
<text>Bloomfield is a neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is located three miles from the downtown area. Bloomfield is sometimes referred to as Pittsburgh&#x27;s Little Italy because it was settled by Italians from the Abruzzi region and has been a center of Italian–American population. Pittsburgh architectural historian Franklin Toker has said that Bloomfield &quot;is a feast, as rich to the eyes as the homemade tortellini and cannoli in its shop windows are to the stomach.&quot; Recently, the neighborhood has attracted young adults and college students as a &quot;hip&quot; neighborhood.

==Location==
Bloomfield is a plateau above the Allegheny River; it is bordered by Penn Avenue on the north, the East Busway on the south, 40th Street on the west, and Gross Street on the east. This last boundary is somewhat disputed – many residents believe that Bloomfield abuts the neighborhood of Friendship at Gross Street. Here the provincial frame rowhouses give way to stand-alone brick Victorian homes, which were built larger on each street heading east. The City of Pittsburgh, however, claims that Bloomfield extends east as far as Graham Street.

The East Busway is set into Skunk Hollow, a ravine that separates Bloomfield from Polish Hill to the west, North Oakland to the southwest, and Shadyside to the south. The neighborhoods are within sight of one another and are connected by the Bloomfield Bridge and the South Millvale Bridge, both of which span this gap.

==City Steps==
The Bloomfield neighborhood has 4 distinct flights of city steps - all of which are open and in a safe condition. In Bloomfield, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians from the main residential area to the lower-elevation streets of Lorigan, Juniper, and Neville. These shady streets offer a mix of residential and industrial buildings and are popular with dog walkers, runners, and cyclists.

==History==
Bloomfield does not appear to have been an independent borough prior to its annexation by the City of Pittsburgh in 1868. Casper Taub sold the land to his son-in-law John Conrad Winebiddle, whose descendants divided it into lots and sold it for development beginning around the time of the 1868 annexation. The community most likely was named for the abundant blooming flowers near the original town site.

In the decades following 1868, Bloomfield was settled by German Catholic immigrants, who in 1886 built St. Joseph&#x27;s Church. Beginning around 1900, Italians from five towns in the Abruzzi region settled here, forming Immaculate Conception Parish in 1905 (that church was rebuilt in its present form in 1961). Descendants from both groups, with ethnic Italians outnumbering the Germans, still give the neighborhood its character today. In 2001 the national churches of St. Joseph&#x27;s and Immaculate Conception were merged to form a single parish.

Since the early 21st century, Bloomfield is one of the neighborhoods that has attracted young adults, including those described as creative and &quot;hip.&quot; Pittsburgh&#x27;s affordability and ethnic history, compared to some other cities, have resulted in new residents settling here.

Since 2002 Bloomfield has hosted Little Italy Days, a large annual festival that has become unpopular with some residents.

==Business district==
The business district is concentrated along Liberty Avenue, with a variety of businesses and services. In addition to the two churches and Western Pennsylvania Hospital, the street has many restaurants and bars, a supermarket and Italian market, tanning and hair salons, a gym, bookstores, barber shops, and more. A small park beside the Bloomfield Bridge holds public &quot;bocce&quot; courts, a playground, a softball field, a skateboarding area, and a &quot;dek hockey&quot; rink.

==Sport==
Baltimore Colts&#x27; Hall of Fame quarterback, Pittsburgh native Johnny Unitas returned to this neighborhood to play. After being cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1955, Unitas played one season for the semipro Bloomfield Rams on Dean&#x27;s Field, located under the Bloomfield Bridge. The semipro league has long since folded, and the Bloomfield Rams no longer exist. The former Dean&#x27;s Field was renamed as Officer Paul J. Sciullo Memorial Field, after a policeman killed in the line of duty. It is now part of a public recreational complex.

<doc id="822079" wikidata="Q5551551" url="?curid=822079" title="German submarine U-215">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-215&quot; was a Type VIID mine-laying U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II. She was one of six U-boats of her kind, equipped with special vertical tubes that launched the mines. Her keel was laid down 15 November 1940 by Germaniawerft in Kiel as yard number 647. The U-boat was launched on 9 October 1941 and commissioned on 22 November with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Fritz Hoeckner in command.

==Design==
As one of the six German Type VIID submarines, &quot;U-215&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 supercharged four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two AEG GU 460/8-276 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-215&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), twelve torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and an anti-aircraft gun, in addition to five mine tubes with fifteen SMA mines. The boat had a complement of 49.

==Service history==

&quot;U-215&quot; was sunk in the summer of 1942 by British warship while on a mission to lay mines in Boston Harbor after attacking and sinking the U.S. liberty ship &quot;Alexander Macomb&quot;, part of an allied convoy. The wreck was not discovered until 2004.

==Wreck site==
She now lies beneath the surface of the Atlantic, off the coast of New England and south of Nova Scotia, in Canadian territorial waters. Four of her five vertical tubes are still sealed, her hatches are still sealed with the remains of 49 German sailors entombed within.

<doc id="822082" wikidata="Q578524" url="?curid=822082" title="European dark bee">
<text>The Apis mellifera mellifera (commonly known as the European dark bee) is a subspecies of the western honey bee, evolving in central Asia, with a proposed origin of the Tien Shan Mountains and later migrating into eastern and then northern Europe after the last ice age from 9,000BC onwards. Its original range included the southern Urals in Russia and stretched through northern Europe and down to the Pyrenees. They are one of the two members of the &#x27;M&#x27; lineage of &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, the other being in western China. Traditionally they were called the &quot;Black German Bee&quot;, although they are now considered endangered in Germany. However today they are more likely to be named after the region in which they live, such as the British black bee, the Native Irish Honey Bee, the Cornish black bee and the Nordic brown bee, even though they are all the same subspecies, with the word &quot;native&quot; often inserted by local beekeepers, even in places where the bee is an introduced foreign species. It was domesticated in Europe and hives were brought to North America in the colonial era in 1622 where they were referred to as the English Fly by the Native Americans.

==Appearance==
The &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; can be broadly distinguished from other subspecies by their stocky body, abundant thoracal and sparse abdominal hair which is brown, and overall dark coloration. When viewed from a distance, they appear blackish or rich dark brown. They are large for honey bees though they have unusually short tongues (). Their common name (dark or black bee) is derived from their brown-black color, with only a few lighter yellow spots on the abdomen. On a pigmentation rating from 0 (completely dark) to 9 (completely bright yellow) the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; scores 2.1, for comparison a &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; scores a 1.3 and a &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot; scores a 7.8. In 2019 research concluded that honey bees in Ireland that were completely dark contained less &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; DNA than bees with yellow to orange spots on their abdomens, and bees with pigmentation on their first and second tergites (segments of their abdomens) contained a comparable amount of &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; DNA than the completely dark bees, the authors speculated that the completely dark bees had obtained their darker pigmentation from &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; DNA.

Friedrich Ruttner worked closely with senior members of the BIBBA (Bee Improvement &amp; Bee Breeders Association) in Britain to identify wing veins (wing morphometry) to achieve &quot;racial purity&quot; in the breeding of their bees, culminating in the publication of their book &quot;The Dark European Honeybee&quot;. However the process depends on the exact measuring methods employed.

==Character==
&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; is descended from the &#x27;M&#x27; lineage of &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, of which all bees to a greater or lesser degree have aggression when compared to the &#x27;C&#x27; lineage.
&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; hybrids have an even greater reputation of aggression amongst beekeepers, which can increase in subsequent generations if left unchecked, although this characteristic can be overcome with continual selective breeding over some generations. They are nervous and aggressive to the extent that routine inspections will take longer, decreasing the enjoyment of managing their colonies. This characteristic is one that has been traditionally associated with &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; going back to the now extinct Old British Black bee before the early 1900s: To quote Brother Adam who was the only beekeeper with first hand experience that committed his findings to paper:

:&quot;The native (Old British Black) bee had undoubtedly many extremely valuable characteristics, but equally so a great many serious defects and drawbacks. She was very bad tempered and very susceptible to brood diseases and would in any case not have been able to produce the crops (of honey) we have secured since her demise&quot;.

In 2014-2017 a European wide survey was conducted with 621 colonies, which included the various subspecies kept by beekeepers, it found that the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; was the most aggressive, had the highest swarming tendency and the lowest hygienic behaviour - a trait closely linked with Varroa sensitive hygiene.

==Characteristics==
* higher levels of aggression
* increased tendency to swarm
* lower resistance to varroa mites due to poorer hygienic behaviour (VSH)
* prone to inbreeding due to habit of Apiary Vicinity Mating, resulting in increased aggression
* susceptibility to acarine mites due to their larger tracheas
* difficulty entering smaller flowers due to their larger size
* difficulty collecting nectar from longer flowers due to their shorter tongues
* poorer pollinators of fruit trees and bushes
*more prone to &quot;Balling the Queen&quot;, resulting in her death
* susceptible to brood diseases
* susceptible to a greater likelihood of Supersedure than other bees
* non-prolific, population building up later in year, unable to take full advantage of an early spring nectar flow
* &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; Queens do not hybridize with non-&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; Drones

==Non-hybridization==
In 2013 research was carried out in Poland which confirmed anecdotal evidence that &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; virgin Queens do not readily mate with non-&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; drones, &quot;The progeny of AMM queens was fathered almost exclusively by AMM drones. On the other hand, progeny of AMC queens was fathered by drones of both subspecies&quot;. Further research was conducted in western Ireland on Beara peninsula (as part of genetic research carried out throughout the island in 2017), which confirmed the 2013 Polish research in that the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; virgin Queens were not mating with either &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; or &quot;Buckfast&quot; drones, nor their hybrids. Several conjectures were presented as an explanation to this characteristic of &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;, but no conclusion was reached.

==Significance==
The &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; had become established from the Urals to northwestern Europe by the 1800s until the introduction of other bee subspecies, considered more suited to modern beekeeping, such as the &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; or the Buckfast bee, a breed of bee whose ancestry originally included the remnants of the old British black bee (a strain or phenotype of &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;), which became extinct due to the &quot;Isle of Wight Disease&quot;.

In the United States, research based on DNA sequencing analysis found DNA from the &#x27;M&#x27; lineage of honey bees in the feral population of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Missouri, believed in part to be the DNA from imported bees of over 100 years ago (DNA from the other bee lineages was also found in these feral populations, suggesting that they likely came from escaped swarms from apiaries at multiple unknown times in the past).

==Promotion and conservation areas==
Dedicated organizations have been attempting to establish exclusive conservation areas for &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;, also breeding groups have been set up to &quot;establish racial purity&quot; of &quot;native strains&quot; and others running courses to train beekeepers in being able to calculate the &quot;racial purity&quot; of their bees through wing morphometry. Other organizations are attempting to establish that the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; in their local geographic region are a distinct &quot;variety&quot;, some even claiming it is a separate subspecies, of the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; subspecies, but to date there is no published research to support this, however through morphometry and DNA analysis local geographic strains may be able to be identified, albeit not consistent across the geographic population, in which the strain&#x27;s characteristics show less morphometric variation and therefore less environmental adaptability. With one group even starting a &quot;project to develop their &quot;own native&quot; breed of bee&quot;. Many promoters of the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; claim that the sub-species is endangered and under threat from imports, even though DNA analysis has been able to show that the amount of non-&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; DNA within local populations of &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; remains relatively low, with an Irish survey showing that 97.8% of sampled bees were determined to be pure &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;, and a further study across eight northwest European countries showing that their &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; populations were genetically pure.

===Nazi Germany===

In 1937 the Third Reich implemented nativist policies to protect and promote the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;, as an extension of their ideology of &quot;Blood and Soil&quot; (&quot;Blut und Boden&quot; - a Nazi slogan expressing a racially defined group pertaining to a geographic area), by banning imports of Honey Bees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) and regulating the breeding of bees, in which only registered breeders at designated locations were permitted to rear queens to supply German beekeepers; however a limited dispensation was made for a minority of &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; beekeepers in southern Germany constituting only 13% overall. But after the annexation of Austria in 1938 the amount of &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; breeders increased to 31%. In 1939 actions were taken to reduce the numbers (by approximately 95%) of &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; being bred in Germany, resulting in the Native German Dark bee being promoted fore-mostly. Beekeeping literature at the time used the racial ideological vocabulary of the National Socialists (only in concentrated form), such as: &quot;What is not race is chaff!&quot; &quot;Foreign drones are to be exterminated&quot; and &quot;But what use is it if one day a Jewish bastard (a German with Jewish ancestry) is a genius, but our ethnic purity is destroyed in the process (through inter-marriage). It is no different with beekeeping, what use is the importation of foreign breeds (sub-species)... if our (Native) German bee is lost in the process (through inter-breeding)&quot;.

However starting in the winter of 1940 to 1942, beekeeping was devastated throughout Germany by huge colony deaths, later identified by Karl Von Frisch as a virulent strain of Nosema apis, through his work with the Nosema Council to try and tackle the problem; ironically it was this epidemic that saved Von Frisch from the Nazis&#x27; antisemitic policies, as his maternal Grandmother was Jewish, making him &quot;25% Jewish&quot; (&quot;75% German&quot;).

As a result restrictions against the breeding of &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; was lifted and German beekeepers began to re-stock with more disease resistant Austrian &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; bees: After the war all National Socialism rhetoric was abandoned and breeding of bees was purely focused on performance and character. It was then decided by the German Beekeeping Associations to keep only the &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; bee due to its superior characteristics; as a result the Old German Dark bee (&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;) is now considered an endangered sub-species in Germany.

===Isle of Man===

In 1988, the &quot;Importation of Bees Order&quot; made it illegal to import bees or used bee equipment into the Isle of Man. Originally this was done to prevent the &quot;Varroa&quot; mite from arriving on the island; in 2015 the EU &quot;declared the Isle of Man officially free of the bee pest Varroa&quot;. However, in 2015 the &quot;Isle of Man Beekeepers&#x27; Federation&quot; launched the &quot;Manx Bee Improvement Group&quot;, to promote what they called the &quot;Manx Dark Honey Bee (&quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot;)&quot;. They work closely with the BIBBA with the stated goal of eliminating &quot;foreign strains&quot; from the island through regular inspections of hives. Beekeepers on the Isle of Man are now compelled to register their bees in line with the &quot;Bee Diseases and Pest Control (Isle of Man) Order 2008&quot;, they must inform the &quot;Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture&quot; of any movement of bees or bee equipment and the creation of new hives; failure to register or comply, risks prosecution and &quot;a fine not exceeding £5,000&quot;.

===Isle of Læsø===
In 1993 a conservation area for &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; was established on the island of Læsø in Denmark, where it became illegal to keep and import any other type of bee other than &quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot;, this was met with protests and a legal battle lasting eight years from other beekeepers of &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;, &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; and &quot;Buckfast&quot; bees as they did not &quot;want to become a custodian of poor bees&quot;, they also stated that &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; was &quot;unproductive&quot; and &quot;not worthy of protection&quot;. They lost their case in 2001, and negotiations between &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; beekeepers and non-&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; beekeepers were concluded in 2004, splitting the island in two between them, ending a &quot;history of sabotage of bees&quot; on the island. The &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; supporters claimed that they had &quot;introduced apartheid on Læsø for the bees&quot;.

A 2014 European wide survey, which covered 621 colonies, found that the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; from Læsø had the lowest hygienic behaviour of all bees tested, (a trait closely linked with Varroa sensitive hygiene) which would make them more susceptible to varroa mites.

===Islands of Colonsay and Oronsay===
In 2013 the Scottish Government introduced the &quot;Bee Keeping (Colonsay and Oronsay) Order&quot;, making it an offence to keep any other honeybee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) on either island other than the subspecies &quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot;. The &quot;Environment and Climate Change&quot; Minister said at the time, &quot;The &quot;Bee Keeping Order&quot; illustrates how our &quot;non-native&quot; species legislation can be used to protect our &quot;native&quot; wildlife. The order is a targeted measure to protect an important population of black bees on Colonsay from hybridisation&quot; (the &quot;&quot;non-native&quot; species legislation&quot; was used because &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; are considered to be &quot;non-native&quot; to Colonsay, but considered &quot;native&quot; to Scotland as it was the &quot;first&quot; honey bee to be introduced for use in &quot;beekeeping&quot;). The islands are home to fifty to sixty beehives (a minimum of fifty colonies of unrelated bees are required to prevent inbreeding) and are referred to now as the &quot;Colonsay Dark &quot;Native&quot; Bee&quot; even though they were collected from across Scotland in the previous thirty years and genetic analysis has shown introgression from Australian and New Zealand &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;. In 2018 it was claimed by the Galtee Bee Breeding Group (GBBG) based in Ireland in County Tipperary that they had &quot;sent bees to Colonsay&quot;, earlier DNA evidence had confirmed a genetic link between the two populations.

==In the media==
*In the documentary &quot;More than Honey&quot;, the bee kept and bred by Swiss-German beekeeper Fred Jaggi was &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;, referred to as the &quot;local black breed&quot;, in which he strives to maintain &quot;racially pure&quot; bees, lamenting when he discovers yellow coloration in the colony of one of his queens, meaning that she has bred with a drone from a different sub-species and produced &quot;little half-breeds&quot;, she is subsequently killed; we see in the documentary his pure bees succumbing to a brood disease and having to be gassed, then burned: Jaggi abandons the local black bees and the goal of racial purity, choosing &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; bees instead, with an apiary that includes hybrids to enhance genetic diversity, which are found to be &quot;more disease resistant&quot;.
*In 2012 a story began to circulate online and in some British newspapers, in which Dorian Pritchard, the Conservation officer for the BIBBA and President of SICAMM (&quot;International Association for the Protection of the European Dark Bee&quot;), was interviewed and quoted, saying that the Old British Black Bee (an extinct strain of &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;) was not extinct and had been discovered in the rafters of a church in Northumberland. There were numerous inaccuracies in the story, including:

:(1) The Old &quot;British Black&quot; bee was &quot;wiped out by a strain of Spanish flu in 1919&quot;:
:The Spanish flu only affected humans, it was the Isle of Wight Disease between 1904 through to 1945 that was believed to have wiped out the &quot;original&quot; Old British (and Irish) &quot;Black Bees&quot; of the British Isles.

:(2) &quot;The Spanish flu which wiped out ... every single bee in the UK&quot;:
:No beekeepers at the time made this claim, what was claimed was that the indigenous &quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot; of the British Isles was wiped out, hybrids with other non-&quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot; bees often survived, notably &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot; and later the &quot;Buckfast bee&quot; bred by Brother Adam of Buckfast Abbey, also continental &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;, imported in subsequent years to repopulate the country, showed stronger resistance to the &quot;Isle of Wight Disease&quot;.

:(3) &quot;The British Black bee is different from other bees ... ideally suited to the British climate ... more so than the European Black bee&quot;:
:This suggests that the &quot;British Black Bee&quot; found in the church is a different subspecies than the &quot;European Black Bee&quot; (&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;), while in fact they are the same subspecies, as acknowledged by Philip Denwood writing in SICAMM&#x27;s magazine &quot;mellifera.ch&quot; in 2014 (as a member of BBKA and the BIBBA) &quot;... in the last decade DNA studies ... have conclusively shown that modern specimens of Dark Bees from the UK and Ireland fit into the genetic specification of &quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot; (the European dark / black bee)&quot;.

==Breeding for Varroa resistance==

===Varroa sensitive hygiene (VSH)===
In 2010, it was announced at the VIth COLOSS Conference that a project using the British native honey bee &quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot; was to be set up to breed for Varroa Sensitive Hygiene (VSH). In April 2016, the Laboratory of Apiculture and Social Insects at the University of Sussex (LASI) began blogging about the project. They stated, &quot;we have established LASI Queen Bees to supply our hygienic bees to UK beekeepers&quot;, supplying &quot;several hundred queens to British beekeepers&quot;. By May 2017 many of the apiaries had a standstill order imposed on them by Bee Inspectors of the National Bee Unit to prevent the spread of EFB (European foulbrood) from infected colonies, a disease associated with a low nurse bee to brood ratio, resulting in lower hygiene levels within the hive. The LASI Queen Bees breeding project &quot;using the British native honey bee&quot; has not been revived.

===Grooming behavior===
In 2016 Dorian Pritchard, a prominent member of the BIBBA and SICAMM, published an article in &quot;The Journal of Apicultural Research&quot;, entitled &quot;Grooming by honey bees as a component of varroa resistant behavior&quot;, in which he reviewed much of the existing research into the &quot;assumed links&quot; between the grooming behavior of honey bees and varroa resistance stating &quot;one of the most effective recognized means of defense is body grooming&quot;, even though varroa mite resistance had already been achieved in 2008 through the breeding of bees with VSH.

In promoting &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; for breeding of the grooming behavior, the paper states that &quot;Anecdotal reports suggest that the high level of resistance of some British near-native &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; strains may be due to grooming, &quot;but no detailed reports have yet been published&quot;&quot;.

Pritchard goes on to promote &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; by citing research by Bak &amp; Wilde (2016) into the grooming behavior and Pritchard states &quot;that &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; of the Augustowska line were outstandingly the most reactive to the presence of a mite placed on their bodies, 98% of bees reacting to shed the mite&quot;; the Bak and Wilde research paper stated &quot;as many as 98% of worker bees in this group (&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;) made an &quot;attempt&quot; to remove mites&quot;, while for &quot;Carniolan (&quot;A. m. carnica&quot;) bees&quot; it was 89.3% and for &quot;Caucasian (&quot;A. m. caucasia&quot;) bees&quot; it was 86%. However, only 8.2% of the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; were &quot;successful&quot; in removing mites, for the &quot;A. m. caucasia&quot; it was 10.9%, and for the &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; it was near 3.5%. It was noted that &quot;no mites were actually damaged in the laboratory experiments&quot; and that &quot;about 80% of mites removed remounted their hosts and remarkably, no physical damage was visible on any mites, even after bees had been seen vigorously shaking and even chewing them&quot;.

However, research into &quot;hygienic behaviour&quot; (VSH) previously published by Siuda &quot;et al&quot;. (2007) had concluded that the &quot;Bees of &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; (also the Augustowska line) demonstrated the strongest ability for cleaning comb cells from dead capped brood, however many of their behavioural characters did not promote the management of modern apiaries. The better solution would be rather the selection of lines with hygienic behaviour on the basis of Carniolan or Caucasian bees&quot;.
A subsequent paper published by Kruitwagen &quot;et al&quot;. (2017) concluded that the grooming behavior itself did not lead to Varroa resistance and on average led to higher mite levels.

Breeding for grooming behavior with the aim of achieving Varroa resistance is still promoted by &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; organisations.

<text>RAC Limited (The RAC) is a British automotive services company headquartered in Walsall, West Midlands. Its principal services are roadside assistance and general insurance, and its subsidiaries include RAC Motoring Services Ltd, RAC Financial Services Ltd and RAC Insurance Limited. It was a private club owned by its members until sold in 1999, eventually acquired in 2014 and 2015 by GIC Private Limited and CVC Capital Partners.

The RAC&#x27;s main competitors are The AA and Green Flag.

==History==

The Royal Automobile Club was formed in 1897 by Frederick Richard Simms, which set up an &quot;associate section&quot; to provide members roadside assistance and motoring services. The club incorporated the associate section as R.A.C. Motoring Services Ltd. in 1978. In 1987, the organisation introduced an &quot;Advanced Computer Aided Rescue System&quot;.

In 1991, it established the RAC Foundation as its research arm. The RAC Foundation was later turned into a charity, and received a legacy from Royal Automobile Club members when R.A.C. Motoring Services Ltd. was sold in 1999. British School of Motoring (BSM) was purchased by R.A.C. Motoring Services Ltd. in December 1998.
The RAC moved into a bespoke control centre at the M4 / M5 interchange in Almondsbury in 1994, designed by Grimshaw Architects.

In 1999, R.A.C. Motoring Services was sold by the members of the Royal Automobile Club to Lex Service for £437m, with each of the 12,000 members receiving £34,000, and each of the 4,000 RAC Motoring Services staff receiving £1,000.

Lex Service renamed themselves RAC plc in 2002. In October 2000, RAC purchased Intergraph&#x27;s Computer Aided Dispatch System (I/CAD), a Command and Control system. The National Customer Service Awards&#x27; recognized the system with the &#x27;Best Use of Technology in Customer Service&#x27; award in October 2004.

Aviva acquired RAC plc for around £1.1 billion in March 2005. They sold some parts of the business for £500m, including RAC Auto Windscreens in December 2008, and BSM to a German company in January 2009. BSM was later sold to Acromas Holdings, which owns The Automobile Association.

Aviva ceased providing loans under the RAC brand name in January 2008, and dissolved its partnership with The Co-operative Bank. Aviva sold the RAC to The Carlyle Group in June 2011. Although Carlyle had planned a stock market flotation for the RAC, in September 2014 Carlyle agreed to sell almost half its stake to Singapore&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Limited. In December 2015, Carlyle agreed to sell its remaining stake to CVC Capital Partners, in a transaction valuing the RAC at £1.4 billion.

==Services==

===Roadside assistance===

The RAC has around 2,000 patrols that attend 2.8 million breakdowns each year, this includes overseas breakdowns with RAC Europe. The RAC covers eight million roadside assistance customers, with 2.2 million individual members and 4.5 million corporate customers. Their breakdown assistance centres operate 24/7, and deal with approximately four millions calls a year.

They have introduced, for trial, two hybrid vehicles, to cut fuel consumption and carbon emissions. In May 2009, a survey by &quot;J.D. Power&quot; ranked the RAC highest in &quot;satisfying roadside assistance customers&quot; for the fourth consecutive year. RAC Europe is breakdown cover for customers from the United Kingdom that travel to Europe.

RAC Europe covers forty seven European countries, and provides English speaking Incident Managers, available twenty four hours a day to assist. The office is based near Lyon, in Villeurbanne, France.

===Other===
RAC Vehicle Checks and Examinations conduct vehicle checks that show if a car has been stolen, written off, has outstanding finance or previous plates, is at risk of being sold illegally, and that its number plate and chassis number correspond.

RAC Vehicle Checks are conducted by Experian, while RAC Examinations Inspectors make physical checks on the car to make sure it is mechanically and structurally sound. The RAC also provides travel and traffic services including online route planners, in car navigation and help with travel documents.

==Motorsport==
In 2006, RAC teamed up with WSR (West Surrey Racing) to form Team RAC and to race in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) with two MG ZS cars and from 2007 onwards, two (and sometimes three) BMW E90 320si cars. The racing cars were liveried in RAC&#x27;s corporate orange and have achieved a number of wins, including winning the BTCC Independent Drivers Championship with Colin Turkington in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

Turkington was also able to clinch the outright win in the 2009 BTCC Drivers Championship for Team RAC. For 2010, RAC reduced their level of sponsorship with the team.

<text>Musicology Live 2004ever was a concert tour by American recording artist Prince to promote his &quot;Musicology&quot; album. The tour began on March 27, 2004 in Reno, Nevada and concluded on September 11 in San Jose, California. It was a commercial success earning $87.4 million from 77 shows in 52 cities across the United States and selling more than 1.4 million tickets. Prince said one of the goals of the tour was &quot;to bring back music and live musicianship.&quot;

== Background and development ==
In April 2004, Prince released his thirtieth studio album &quot;Musicology&quot; from Columbia Records after leaving former record labels Warner Bros. and Arista. The album followed the 2003 releases &quot;Xpectation&quot; and &quot;N.E.W.S&quot;. When speaking about the album, Prince stated: 

&quot;I am really an artist and a musician at heart, that&#x27;s what I do. Musicology has no boundaries or formats. It is long overdue to return to the art and craft of music, that&#x27;s what this album is about. School&#x27;s in session.&quot;
The singer gave a small performance at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles in February to preview some of the new songs from the album where he also announced plans for an upcoming tour. Tour dates were announced later that month in North America. He opened the 2004 Grammy Awards with Beyoncé and was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the same year. More tour dates were announced shortly afterward.

The Musicology Tour also increased sales of the &quot;Musicology&quot; album because concertgoers received a copy of &quot;Musicology&quot;, with the album cost included in the ticket price for the tour. This prompted &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine and Nielsen SoundScan to change its chart data methodology: For future album releases, &quot;Billboard&quot; says that customers &quot;must be given an option to either add the CD to the ticket purchase or forgo the CD for a reduced ticket-only price.&quot;

<text>The Wada test, also known as the [[carotid artery|intracarotid]] [[sodium]] [[amobarbital]] procedure (ISAP) or Wada-Milner Test, establishes cerebral language and memory representation of each hemisphere.

==Method==
Medical professionals conduct the test with the patient awake. A barbiturate, usually sodium amobarbital, is introduced into one of the internal carotid arteries via a cannula or intra-arterial catheter from the femoral artery. The drug is injected into one hemisphere at a time through the right or left internal carotid artery. If the right carotid is injected, the right side of the brain is inhibited and cannot communicate with the left side. The effect shuts down any language and/or memory function in that hemisphere in order to evaluate the other hemisphere. An EEG recording at the same time confirms that the injected side of the brain is inactive as a neurologist performs a neurological examination. The neurologist engages the patient in a series of language and memory related tests. They evaluate the memory by showing a series of items or pictures to the patient and—within a few minutes, as soon as the effect of the medication dissipates—testing the patient&#x27;s ability to recall. The test is typically administered by a neuropsychologist as a result of expertise in psychometric testing. Correlation with formal neuropsychological testing has some predictive power regarding seizure outcome following anterior temporal lobectomy.

There is currently great variability in the processes used to administer the test, and so it is difficult to compare results from one patient to the other.

==Uses==
The test is usually performed prior to ablative surgery for epilepsy and sometimes prior to tumor resection. The aim is to determine which side of the brain is responsible for certain vital cognitive functions, namely speech and memory. The risk of post-operative cognitive change can be estimated, and depending on the surgical approach employed at the epilepsy surgery center, the need for awake craniotomies can be determined as well.

The Wada test has several side-effects. Drastic personality changes are rarely noted, but disinhibition is common. Also, contralateral hemiplegia, hemineglect and shivering are often seen. After injection on the side of the speech-dominant hemisphere, typically the left, the patient experiences transient aphasia, ie. impaired speech and language or the inability to express or understand language. Though the patient may not be able to talk, sometimes their ability to sing is preserved. This is because music and singing uses a different part of the brain than speech and language. Recovery from the anesthesia is rapid, and EEG recordings and distal grip strength may be used to determine when the medication has worn off. Generally, recovery of speech is dysphasic (contains errors in speech or comprehension) after a language dominant hemisphere injection.

Though generally considered a safe procedure, there are at least minimal risks associated with the angiography procedure that guides the catheter to the internal carotid artery, perhaps related to the physician&#x27;s experience. Researchers are looking into non-invasive ways to determine language and memory laterality—such as fMRI, TMS, magnetoencephalography, and near-infrared spectroscopy.

==History==
The Wada test is named after Japanese neurologist and epileptologist Juhn Atsushi Wada, of the University of British Columbia. He developed the test while he was a medical resident in Japan just after World War II, when he was receiving training in neurosurgery. Wada developed the technique of transient hemispheric anesthetization through carotid amytal injection to decrease the cognitive side effects associated with bilateral electroconvulsive therapy. He published the initial description of motor, sensory, language, and effects on the &quot;conscious state&quot; in 1949, in Japanese. During his fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute, he introduced the test to Dr. Brenda Milner and associates, who modified the test to assess language laterality and memory function prior to a unilateral lobectomy. As this is now the primary use of the procedure, some neuropsychologists argue for it to be renamed the Wada-Milner Test in recognition of her significant contributions.

<text>Runes are the letters in a set of related alphabets, known as runic rows, runic alphabets or futharks (also, see &quot;futhark&quot; vs &quot;runic alphabet&quot;), native to the Germanic peoples of the 1st millennium and beyond. Runes were used to write Germanic languages (with some exceptions) before they adopted the Latin alphabet, and for specialised purposes thereafter. In addition to representing a sound value (a phoneme), runes can be used to represent the concepts after which they are named (ideographs). Scholars refer to instances of the latter as (&#x27;concept runes&#x27;). The Scandinavian variants are also known as &quot;fuþark&quot;, or &quot;futhark&quot;; this name is derived from the first six letters of the script, ⟨ᚠ⟩, ⟨ᚢ⟩, ⟨ᚦ⟩, ⟨ᚨ⟩/⟨ᚬ⟩, ⟨ᚱ⟩, and ⟨ᚲ⟩/⟨ᚴ⟩, corresponding to the Latin letters ⟨f⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨þ⟩/⟨th⟩, ⟨a⟩, ⟨r⟩, and ⟨k⟩. The Anglo-Saxon variant is known as &quot;futhorc&quot;, or &quot;&quot;, due to changes in Old English of the sounds represented by the fourth letter, ⟨ᚨ⟩/⟨ᚩ⟩.

Runology is the academic study of the runic alphabets, runic inscriptions, runestones, and their history. Runology forms a specialised branch of Germanic philology.

The earliest secure runic inscriptions date from around AD 150, with a potentially earlier inscription dating to AD 50 and Tacitus&#x27;s potential description of rune use from around AD 98. The Svingerud Runestone dates from between AD 1 and 250. Runes were generally replaced by the Latin alphabet as the cultures that had used runes underwent Christianisation, by approximately AD 700 in central Europe and 1100 in northern Europe. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes beyond this period. Up until the early 20th century, runes were still used in rural Sweden for decorative purposes in Dalarna and on runic calendars.

The three best-known runic alphabets are the Elder Futhark ( AD 150–800), the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc (400–1100), and the Younger Futhark (800–1100). The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes (also called &quot;Danish&quot;, although they were also used in Norway, Sweden, and Frisia); short-branch, or Rök, runes (also called &quot;Swedish–Norwegian&quot;, although they were also used in Denmark); and the &quot;&quot;, or Hälsinge, runes (staveless runes). The Younger Futhark developed further into the medieval runes (1100–1500), and the Dalecarlian runes ( 1500–1800).

The exact development of the early runic alphabet remains unclear but the script ultimately stems from the Phoenician alphabet. Early runes may have developed from the Raetic, Venetic, Etruscan, or Old Latin as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for epigraphy, which would become characteristic of the runes and related scripts in the region.

The process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest clear inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany. A &quot;West Germanic hypothesis&quot; suggests transmission via Elbe Germanic groups, while a &quot;Gothic hypothesis&quot; presumes transmission via East Germanic expansion. Runes continue to be used in a wide variety of ways in modern popular culture.

== Name ==
=== Etymology ===
The name stems from a Proto-Germanic form reconstructed as , which may be translated as &#x27;secret, mystery; secret conversation; rune&#x27;. It is the source of Gothic (, &#x27;secret, mystery, counsel&#x27;), Old English (&#x27;whisper, mystery, secret, rune&#x27;), Old Saxon (&#x27;secret counsel, confidential talk&#x27;), Middle Dutch (&#x27;id&#x27;), Old High German (&#x27;secret, mystery&#x27;), and Old Norse (&#x27;secret, mystery, rune&#x27;). The earliest Germanic epigraphic attestation is the Primitive Norse (accusative singular), found on the Einang stone (AD 350–400) and the Noleby stone (AD 450).

The term is related to Proto-Celtic (&#x27;secret, magic&#x27;), which is attested in Old Irish (&#x27;mystery, secret&#x27;), Middle Welsh (&#x27;mystery, charm&#x27;), Middle Breton (&#x27;secret wisdom&#x27;), and possibly in the ancient Gaulish (&lt; &#x27;confident&#x27;; cf. Middle Welsh , Middle Breton , Middle Irish &#x27;shared secret, confidence&#x27;) and (&lt; &#x27;sacred secret&#x27;), as well as in Lepontic (&lt; * &#x27;belonging to the secret&#x27;). However, it is difficult to tell whether they are cognates (linguistic siblings from a common origin), or if the Proto-Germanic form reflects an early borrowing from Celtic. Various connections have been proposed with other Indo-European terms (for example: Sanskrit &#x27;roar&#x27;, Latin &#x27;noise, rumor&#x27;; Ancient Greek &#x27;ask&#x27; and &#x27;investigate&#x27;), although linguist Ranko Matasović finds them difficult to justify for semantic or linguistic reasons. Because of this, some scholars have speculated that the Germanic and Celtic words may have been a shared religious term borrowed from an unknown non-Indo-European language.

=== Related terms ===
In early Germanic, a rune could also be referred to as , a compound of and (&#x27;staff; letter&#x27;). It is attested in Old Norse , Old English , and Old High German .&#x27; Other Germanic terms derived from include (&#x27;counsellor&#x27;), and (&#x27;secret, mystery&#x27;), (&#x27;trial, inquiry, experiment&#x27;), (&#x27;secret of the mind, magical rune&#x27;), and (&#x27;witch, sorceress&#x27;; literally &#x27;[possessor of the] Hel-secret&#x27;).&#x27; It is also often part of personal names, including Gothic (), Frankish , Old Norse , , , , , Old English , and Lombardic .

The Finnish word , meaning &#x27;poem&#x27;, is an early borrowing from Proto-Germanic, and the source of the term for rune, , meaning &#x27;scratched letter&#x27;. The root may also be found in the Baltic languages, where Lithuanian means both &#x27;to cut (with a knife)&#x27; and &#x27;to speak&#x27;.

The Old English form survived into the early modern period as &quot;roun&quot;, which is now obsolete. The modern English &quot;rune&quot; is a later formation that is partly derived from Late Latin , Old Norse , and Danish .

== History and use ==

The runes were in use among the Germanic peoples from the 1st or 2nd century AD. This period corresponds to the late Common Germanic stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries: North Germanic, West Germanic, and East Germanic.

No distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for labiovelars in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the Anglo-Saxon futhorc and the Gothic alphabet as variants of &quot;p&quot;; see .)

=== Origins ===
The formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early 5th century, with the Kylver Stone being the first evidence of the &quot;futhark&quot; ordering as well as of the &quot;p&quot; rune.

Specifically, the Rhaetic alphabet of Bolzano is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes, with only five Elder Futhark runes ( &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ï&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;ŋ&quot;, &quot;p&quot;) having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet. Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the Latin alphabet itself over Rhaetic candidates. A &quot;North Etruscan&quot; thesis is supported by the inscription on the Negau helmet B dating to the 2nd century BC. This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name, . Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante suggest that runes derived from some North Italic alphabet, specifically Venetic: But since Romans conquered Veneto after 200 BC, and then the Latin alphabet became prominent and Venetic culture diminished in importance, Germanic people could have adopted the Venetic alphabet within the 3rd century BC or even earlier.

The angular shapes of the runes are shared with most contemporary alphabets of the period that were used for carving in wood or stone. There are no &quot;horizontal&quot; strokes: when carving a message on a flat staff or stick, it would be along the grain, thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood. This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets, such as the early form of the Latin alphabet used for the Duenos inscription, but it is not universal, especially among early runic inscriptions, which frequently have variant rune shapes, including horizontal strokes. Runic manuscripts (that is &quot;written&quot; rather than carved runes, such as ) also show horizontal strokes.

The &quot;West Germanic hypothesis&quot; speculates on an introduction by West Germanic tribes. This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, found in bogs and graves around Jutland (the Vimose inscriptions), exhibit word endings that, being interpreted by Scandinavian scholars to be Proto-Norse, are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion.
In the early Runic period, differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small. Another theory presumes a Northwest Germanic unity preceding the emergence of Proto-Norse proper from roughly the 5th century. An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by È. A. Makaev, who presumes a &quot;special runic koine&quot;, an early &quot;literary Germanic&quot; employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic (2nd to 5th centuries), while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse.

=== The Meldorf fibula and Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; ===
With the potential exception of the Meldorf fibula, a possible runic inscription found in Schleswig-Holstein dating to around 50 AD, the earliest reference to runes (and runic divination) may occur in Roman Senator Tacitus&#x27;s ethnographic &quot;Germania&quot;. Dating from around 98 CE, Tacitus describes the Germanic peoples as utilizing a divination practice involving rune-like inscriptions:

For divination and casting lots they have the highest possible regard. Their procedure for casting lots is uniform: They break off the branch of a fruit tree and slice into strips; they mark these by certain signs and throw them, as random chance will have it, on to a white cloth. Then a state priest, if the consultation is a public one, or the father of the family, if it is private, prays to the gods and, gazing to the heavens, picks up three separate strips and reads their meaning from the marks scored on them. If the lots forbid an enterprise, there can be no further consultation about it that day; if they allow it, further confirmation by divination is required.

As Victoria Symons summarizes, &quot;If the inscriptions made on the lots that Tacitus refers to are understood to be letters, rather than other kinds of notations or symbols, then they would necessarily have been runes, since no other writing system was available to Germanic tribes at this time.&quot;

=== Early inscriptions ===

Runic inscriptions from the 400-year period 150–550 AD are described as &quot;Period I&quot;. These inscriptions are generally in Elder Futhark, but the set of letter shapes and bindrunes employed is far from standardized. Notably the &quot;j&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;ŋ&quot; runes undergo considerable modifications, while others, such as &quot;p&quot; and &quot;ï&quot;, remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the Kylver Stone ( 400 AD).

Artifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to 200 AD, as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig (North Germany), Funen, Zealand, Jutland (Denmark), and Scania (Sweden). Earlier—but less reliable—artifacts have been found in Meldorf, , in northern Germany; these include brooches and combs found in graves, most notably the Meldorf fibula, and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions.

=== Magical or divinatory use ===

The stanza 157 of attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life. In this stanza, Odin recounts a spell:

The earliest runic inscriptions found on artifacts give the name of either the craftsman or the proprietor, or sometimes, remain a linguistic mystery. Due to this, it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as magical signs to be used for charms. Although some say the runes were used for divination, there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way. The name &quot;rune&quot; itself, taken to mean &quot;secret, something hidden&quot;, seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric, or restricted to an elite. The 6th-century Björketorp Runestone warns in Proto-Norse using the word &quot;rune&quot; in both senses:

The same curse and use of the word, rune, is also found on the Stentoften Runestone. There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes, such as the Franks Casket (AD 700) panel.

Charm words, such as , , , and most commonly, , appear on a number of Migration period Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them. Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions. Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose, such as and . Further, an inscription on the Gummarp Runestone (500–700 AD) gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f-rune written three times in succession.

Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic &quot;oracles&quot;: although Norse literature is full of references to runes, it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination. There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may, or may not, refer to runes: Tacitus&#x27;s 1st-century , Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s 13th-century , and Rimbert&#x27;s 9th-century .

The first source, Tacitus&#x27;s , describes &quot;signs&quot; chosen in groups of three and cut from &quot;a nut-bearing tree&quot;, although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus&#x27; writings. A second source is the , where Granmar, the king of , goes to Uppsala for the . There, the &quot;chips&quot; fell in a way that said that he would not live long (). These &quot;chips&quot;, however, are easily explainable as a (sacrificial chip), which was &quot;marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken, and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.&quot;

The third source is Rimbert&#x27;s , where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination, but Rimbert calls it &quot;drawing lots&quot;. One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king, Anund Uppsale, first brings a Danish fleet to Birka, but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to &quot;draw lots&quot;. According to the story, this &quot;drawing of lots&quot; was quite informative, telling them that attacking Birka would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead. The tool in the &quot;drawing of lots&quot;, however, is easily explainable as a (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson would be used in the same manner as a .

The lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist, usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence.

=== Medieval use ===
As Proto-Germanic evolved into its later language groups, the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes, rename or rearrange its rune names slightly, or stop using obsolete runes completely, to accommodate these changes. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent diphthongs unique to (or at least prevalent in) Old English.

Some later runic finds are on monuments (runestones), which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds. For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes, and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers.

In the mid-1950s, however, approximately 670 inscriptions, known as the Bryggen inscriptions, were found in Bergen. These inscriptions were made on wood and bone, often in the shape of sticks of various sizes, and contained information of an everyday nature—ranging from name tags, prayers (often in Latin), personal messages, business letters, and expressions of affection, to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature. Following this find, it is nowadays commonly presumed that, at least in late use, Runic was a widespread and common writing system.

In the later Middle Ages, runes also were used in the clog almanacs (sometimes called &quot;Runic staff&quot;, &quot;Prim&quot;, or &quot;Scandinavian calendar&quot;) of Sweden and Estonia. The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed; most of them have been dated to modern times.

=== Runes in Eddic poetry ===
In Norse mythology, the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin (). This is attested as early as on the Noleby Runestone from that reads , meaning &quot;I prepare the suitable divine rune...&quot; and in an attestation from the 9th century on the Sparlösa Runestone, which reads , meaning &quot;And interpret the runes of divine origin&quot;. In the Poetic Edda poem , Stanza 80, the runes also are described as :

The poem explains that the originator of the runes was the major deity, Odin. Stanza 138 describes how Odin received the runes through self-sacrifice:

In stanza 139, Odin continues:

In the Poetic Edda poem another origin is related of how the runic alphabet became known to humans. The poem relates how , identified as in the introduction, sired three sons— (slave), (freeman), and (noble)—by human women. These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names. When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility, returned and, having claimed him as a son, taught him the runes. In 1555, the exiled Swedish archbishop recorded a tradition that a man named had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic.

== Futharks ==

&quot;Futhark&quot; is a collective term in runology used to describe all runic rows which follows the Germanic alphabetical order of F, U, Þ, A, R, K.. etc (compare ). In English, it is also common to call each futhark after its regional composition, since the original A-rune and K-rune shifted regionally through time: &quot;Futhark&quot; (ᚠᚢᚦᚨᚱᚲ) can specify the Elder runic row, &quot;Futhorc&quot; (ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳ) can specify the Anglo-Frisian runic row, and &quot;Futhork&quot; (ᚠᚢᚦᚯᚱᚴ) can specify the Younger runic row. The younger can further be divided into &quot;Futhąrk&quot; and &quot;Futhork&quot; based on the early and late transliteration of the younger Óss-rune ().

=== Elder Futhark (2nd to 8th centuries) ===

The Elder Futhark, used for writing Proto-Norse, consists of 24 runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is referred to as an &quot;ætt&quot; (Old Norse, meaning &#x27;clan, group&#x27;). The earliest known sequential listing of the full set of 24 runes dates to approximately AD 400 and is found on the Kylver Stone in Gotland, Sweden.

Each rune most likely had a name which was chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself. The names are, however, not directly attested for the Elder Futhark themselves. Germanic philologists reconstruct names in Proto-Germanic based on the names given for the runes in the later alphabets attested in the rune poems and the linked names of the letters of the Gothic alphabet. For example, the letter /a/ was named from the runic letter called Ansuz. An asterisk before the rune names means that they are unattested reconstructions. The 24 Elder Futhark runes are the following:

=== Anglo-Saxon runes (5th to 11th centuries) ===

The Anglo-Saxon runes, also known as the &quot;futhorc&quot; (sometimes written &quot;fuþorc&quot;), are an extended alphabet, consisting of 29, and later 33, characters. It was probably used from the 5th century onwards. There are competing theories as to the origins of the Anglo-Saxon (also called Anglo-Frisian) Futhorc. One theory proposes that it was developed in Frisia and later spread to England, while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England, where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia. Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the Thames scramasax, in the Vienna Codex, in Cotton Otho B.x (Anglo-Saxon rune poem) and on the Ruthwell Cross.

The Anglo-Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names: feoh, ur, þorn, os, rad, cen, gyfu, ƿynn, hægl, nyd, is, ger, eoh, peorð, eolh, sigel, tir, beorc, eh, mann, lagu, ing, œthel, dæg, ac, æsc, yr, ior, ear.

Extra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include cweorð, calc, gar, and stan. Some of these additional letters have only been found in manuscripts. Feoh, þorn, and sigel stood for [f], [θ], and [s] in most environments, but voiced to [v], [ð], and [z] between vowels or voiced consonants. Gyfu and wynn stood for the letters yogh and wynn, which became [g] and [w] in Middle English.

=== &quot;Marcomannic runes&quot; (8th to 9th centuries) ===
A runic alphabet consisting of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo-Saxon futhorc is recorded in a treatise called &quot;De Inventione Litterarum&quot;, ascribed to Hrabanus Maurus and preserved in 8th- and 9th-century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the Carolingian Empire (Alemannia, Bavaria). The manuscript text attributes the runes to the &quot;Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus&quot;, and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called &quot;Marcomannic runes&quot;, but it has no connection with the Marcomanni, and rather is an attempt by Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents.

Wilhelm Grimm discussed these runes in 1821.

=== Younger Futhark (9th to 11th centuries) ===

The Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the Elder Futhark, consisting of only 16 characters. The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse. They are found in Scandinavia and Viking Age settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes. The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional (viz., the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood).

== Runic alphabets ==

&quot;Runic alphabets&quot; is periodically used in runology to describe runic rows following the Latin alphabetical order of ABCD.. etc (compare ).

=== Medieval runes (12th to 15th centuries) ===


In the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the Old Norse language. Dotted variants of voiceless signs were introduced to denote the corresponding voiced consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms, and some letters, such as &quot;s&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; often were used interchangeably.

Medieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes. Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in Bergen since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so-called Bryggen inscriptions). This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries. Indeed, some of the medieval runic inscriptions are written in Latin.

=== Dalecarlian runes (16th to 19th centuries) ===

According to Carl-Gustav Werner, &quot;In the isolated province of Dalarna in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin letters developed.&quot; The Dalecarlian runes came into use in the early 16th century and remained in some use up to the 20th century. Some discussion remains on whether their use was an unbroken tradition throughout this period or whether people in the 19th and 20th centuries learned runes from books written on the subject. The character inventory was used mainly for transcribing Swedish in areas where Elfdalian was predominant.

== Differences from Roman script ==
While Roman script would ultimately replace runes in most contexts, it differed significantly from runic script. For example, on the differences between the use of Anglo-Saxon runes and the Latin script that would come to replace them, runologist Victoria Symons says:

As well as being distinguished from the roman alphabet in visual appearance and letter order, the fuþorc is further set apart by the fact that, unlike their roman counterparts, runic letters are often associated not only with sound values but also with names. These names are often nouns and, in almost all instances, they begin with the sound value represented by the associated letter. ... The fact that each rune represents [both] a sound value and a word gives this writing system a multivalent quality that further distinguishes it from roman script. A roman letter simply represents its sound value. When used, for example, for the purpose of pagination, such letters can assume added significance, but this is localised to the context of an individual manuscript. Runic letters, on the other hand, are inherently multivalent; they can, and often do, represent several different kinds of information simultaneously. This aspect of runic letters is one that is frequently employed and exploited by writers and scribes who include them in their manuscripts.

== Use as ideographs (&quot;Begriffsrunen&quot;) ==
In addition to their historic use as letters in the runic alphabets, runes were also used to represent their names (ideographs). Such instances are sometimes referred to by way of the modern German loan word &quot;Begriffsrunen&quot;, meaning &#x27;concept-runes&#x27; (singular &quot;Begriffsrune&quot;). The criteria for the use of &quot;Begriffsrunen&quot; and the frequency of their use by ancient rune-writers remains controversial. The topic of &quot;Begriffsrunen&quot; has produced much discussion among runologists. Runologist Klaus Düwel has proposed two criteria for the identification of runes as &quot;Begriffsrunen&quot;: A graphic argument and a semantic argument.

Examples of &quot;Begriffsrunen&quot; (or potential &quot;Begriffsrunen&quot;) include the following:

In addition to the instances above, several different runes occur as ideographs in Old English and Old Norse manuscripts (featuring Anglo-Saxon runes and Younger Futhark runes respectively). Runologist Thomas Birkett summarizes these numerous instances as follows:

== Runology ==
The modern study of runes was initiated during the Renaissance, by Johannes Bureus (1568–1652). Bureus viewed runes as holy or magical in a kabbalistic sense. The study of runes was continued by Olof Rudbeck Sr (1630–1702) and presented in his collection &quot;Atlantica&quot;. Anders Celsius (1701–1744) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the &quot;runstenar&quot;. From the &quot;golden age of philology&quot; in the 19th century, runology formed a specialized branch of Germanic linguistics.

== Body of inscriptions ==

The largest group of surviving Runic inscription are Viking Age Younger Futhark runestones, commonly found in Denmark and Sweden. Another large group are medieval runes, most commonly found on small objects, often wooden sticks. The largest concentration of runic inscriptions are the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen, more than 650 in total. Elder Futhark inscriptions number around 350, about 260 of which are from Scandinavia, of which about half are on bracteates. Anglo-Saxon futhorc inscriptions number around 100 items.

== Modern use ==
Runic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the 18th-century Viking revival, in Scandinavian Romantic nationalism (Gothicismus) and Germanic occultism in the 19th century, and in the context of the Fantasy genre and of modern Germanic paganism in the 20th century.

=== Esotericism ===
==== Germanic mysticism and Nazi Germany ====


The pioneer of the &quot;Armanist&quot; branch of Ariosophy and one of the more important figures in esotericism in Germany and Austria in the late 19th and early 20th century was the Austrian occultist, mysticist, and völkisch author, Guido von List. In 1908, he published in &quot;Das Geheimnis der Runen&quot; (&quot;The Secret of the Runes&quot;) a set of eighteen so-called, &quot;Armanen runes&quot;, based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List&#x27;s own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902. The use of runes in Germanic mysticism, notably List&#x27;s &quot;Armanen runes&quot; and the derived &quot;Wiligut runes&quot; by Karl Maria Wiligut, played a certain role in Nazi symbolism. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to Heinrich Himmler, and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (&quot;SS&quot;), the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the SS-Ehrenring, which displays a number of &quot;Wiligut runes&quot;.

==== Modern paganism and esotericism ====
Runes are popular in New Age esotericism, modern Germanic paganism, and to a lesser extent in other forms of modern paganism. Various systems of Runic divination have been published since the 1980s, notably by Ralph Blum (1982), Stephen Flowers (1984, onward), Stephan Grundy (1990), and Nigel Pennick (1995).

The Uthark theory originally was proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by Sigurd Agrell in 1932.
In 2002, Swedish esotericist Thomas Karlsson popularized this &quot;Uthark&quot; runic row, which he refers to as, the &quot;night side of the runes&quot;, in the context of modern occultism.

=== Bluetooth ===
The Bluetooth logo is the combination of two runes of the Younger Futhark, &quot;hagall&quot; and &quot;bjarkan&quot;, equivalent to the letters H and B, that are the initials of Harald “Blåtand” Gormsson&#x27;s name (&quot;Bluetooth&quot; in English), who was a king of Denmark from the Viking Age.

=== Fantasy literature ===
Runes play an important role in the horror story &quot;Casting the Runes,&quot; by the academic Medievalist and ghost story author M. R. James, first published in his 1911 collection &quot;More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary.&quot; In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a map and on the title page to emphasize its connection to the Dwarves. They also were used in the initial drafts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but later were replaced by the Cirth rune-like alphabet invented by Tolkien, used to write the language of the Dwarves, Khuzdul. Following Tolkien, historical and fictional runes appear commonly in modern popular culture, particularly in fantasy literature, like in J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, where Runes is a subject taught at Hogwarts, also in the 7th book &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Dumbledore gave Hermione a children&#x27;s book called &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; which is written in runes.

=== Video, board and role-playing games ===
Runes feature extensively in many video games that incorporate themes from early Germanic cultures, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Jøtun&quot;, &quot;Northgard&quot; and &quot;God of War&quot;. They are used for a range of purposes including as names, symbols, decoration and on runestones that provide information about Nordic mythology and background for the game&#x27;s narrative.

The 1992 video game &quot;Heimdall&quot; used runes as &quot;magical symbols&quot; associated with unnatural forces. Role-playing games, such as the &quot;Ultima&quot; series, use a runic font for in-game signs and printed maps and booklets, and Metagaming&#x27;s &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; used rune-based cipher for clues and jokes throughout its publications.

== Unicode ==

Runic alphabets were added to the Unicode Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.

The Unicode block for Runic alphabets is U+16A0–U+16FF. It is intended to encode the letters of the Elder Futhark, the Anglo-Frisian runes, and the Younger Futhark long-branch and short-twig (but not the staveless) variants, in cases where cognate letters have the same shape resorting to &quot;unification&quot;.

The block as of Unicode 3.0 contained 81 symbols: 75 runic letters (U+16A0–U+16EA), 3 punctuation marks (Runic Single Punctuation U+16EB , Runic Multiple Punctuation U+16EC and Runic Cross Punctuation U+16ED ), and three runic symbols that are used in early modern runic calendar staves (&quot;Golden number Runes&quot;, Runic Arlaug Symbol U+16EE , Runic Tvimadur Symbol U+16EF , Runic Belgthor Symbol U+16F0 ). As of Unicode 7.0 (2014), eight characters were added, three representing J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s mode of writing Modern English in Anglo-Saxon runes, and five for the &quot;cryptogrammic&quot; vowel symbols used in an inscription on the Franks Casket.

<text>Middlesex County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Middlesex which has effectively been subsumed within the ceremonial county of Greater London. The club was founded in 1864 but teams representing the county have played top-class cricket since the early 18th century and the club has always held first-class status. Middlesex have competed in the County Championship since the official start of the competition in 1890 and have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England.

The club plays most of its home games at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, which is owned by Marylebone Cricket Club, in St John&#x27;s Wood. The club also plays some games at the Uxbridge Cricket Club Ground (historically Middlesex) and the Old Deer Park in Richmond (historically Surrey). Until October 2014, the club played limited overs cricket as the Middlesex Panthers, having changed from Middlesex Crusaders in 2009 following complaints from Muslims and Jews. On 24 October 2014, the club announced that they would use the name Middlesex County Cricket Club in all forms of the sport with immediate effect. Limited-overs kit colours are dark blue and pink quarters and from 2007, Middlesex have worn exclusive pink shirts during their Twenty20 matches in support of the Breakthrough Breast Cancer charity. The club has an indoor school based in Finchley, the Middlesex Academy and a project at Radlett Cricket Club.

Middlesex have won thirteen County Championship titles (including 2 shared titles), the most recent in 2016. In limited overs cricket, they have won two Benson &amp; Hedges Cups, four one-day cricket titles, one National League and the Twenty20 Cup, through which they became the first county club to qualify for both the Stanford Super Series and the Twenty20 Champions League.

==History==

===Earliest cricket===
It is almost certain that cricket reached London, and thereby Middlesex, by the 16th century. Early references to the game in London or Middlesex are often interchangeable and sometimes it is not clear if a particular team represents the city or the county.

&quot;See:&quot; History of cricket to 1696 and History of cricket 1697 - 1725

The first definite mention of cricket in London or Middlesex dates from 1680. It is a clear reference to &quot;the two umpires&quot; (the earliest mention of an umpire in what seems to be a cricket connection) and strongly suggests that the double wicket form of the game was already well known in London.

The earliest known match in Middlesex took place at Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Fields in Holborn on 3 July 1707 involving teams from London and Croydon. In 1718, the first reference is found to White Conduit Fields in Islington, which later became a very famous London venue.

The earliest known reference to a team called Middlesex is on 5 August 1728 when it played London Cricket Club &quot;in the fields behind the Woolpack, in Islington, near Sadlers Wells, for £50 a side&quot;. This was also the earliest known match involving a Middlesex team.

&quot;For information about Middlesex county teams before the formation of Middlesex CCC, see: &quot;Middlesex county cricket teams

===Origin of club===
There are references to earlier county organisations, especially the MCC Thursday Club around 1800, but the definitive Middlesex club is the present Middlesex CCC. The club was informally founded on 15 December 1863 at a meeting in the &quot;London Tavern&quot;. Formal constitution took place on 2 February 1864. The creation of the club was largely through the efforts of the Walker family of Southgate, which included several notable players including the famous V. E. Walker, who in 1859 became the first player to take 10 wickets in an innings and score a century in the same match.

===Early history===
Middlesex CCC played its initial first-class match versus Sussex CCC at Islington on 6 &amp; 7 June 1864. In the same season, the club was a contender for the title of &quot;Champion County&quot;. Middlesex played at Lillie Bridge Grounds from 1869 before leaving in 1872 due to the poor quality of the turf. The club nearly folded at this time, a vote for continuing being won 7–6. They played at Prince&#x27;s Cricket Ground from 1872 to 1876, and began using Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground in 1877.

===20th century===
The club has produced several noted players, particularly the great batsmen Patsy Hendren, Bill Edrich and Denis Compton.

Bill Edrich scored 1,000 runs before the end of May in 1938. He needed just 15 innings, with 4 centuries, and every run was scored at Lord&#x27;s. Don Bradman gave him the chance to score the 10 runs he needed in the Australian tour match with Middlesex by declaring his team&#x27;s innings early.

Middlesex won the County Championship in 1947 thanks to the unprecedented run scoring of Compton and Edrich. They both passed Tom Hayward&#x27;s 1906 record of 3,518 runs in a season with Compton making 3,816 at 90.86 and Edrich 3,539 at 80.43 with a dozen centuries. Compton&#x27;s 18 centuries surpassed Jack Hobbs&#x27; former record of 16, set in 1925. Together with Jack Robertson&#x27;s 2,214 runs and Syd Brown&#x27;s 1,709 and the bowling of Jack Young, Jim Sims, Laurie Gray and Compton and Edrich themselves, the championship was won. The following season Compton and Edrich made their record unbeaten stand of 424 for the 3rd wicket against Somerset at Lords.

Middlesex&#x27;s most successful period coincided with the captaincies of Mike Brearley and Mike Gatting from 1971 to 1997. Brearley proved as astute for his county as he did for his country between 1971 and 1982. His team included Gatting and England spin bowlers John Emburey and Phil Edmonds, and overseas fast bowlers such as Wayne Daniel.

===Recent history===
In 2007 Middlesex had mixed fortunes in Domestic Cricket. In the 4-Day version of the game, the club finished 3rd of the nine teams in Division 2 of the Liverpool Victoria County Championship, narrowly missing out on promotion. However, 3rd place in Division 2 of the NatWest Pro 40 League was enough to earn them a place in the play-off final against Northamptonshire Steelbacks. Middlesex won that game comfortably and therefore gained promotion to Division 1 for the 2008 Season. There was less success in the two knockout cups where Middlesex failed to progress beyond the group stages of either tournament. In the Friends Provident Trophy they finished 7th of the ten teams in the Southern Division. Likewise in the Twenty20 Cup, 5th place of the six teams in the Southern Division was not good enough to see them progress.

In 2008, Middlesex won the Twenty20 Cup by beating Kent in the final at The Rose Bowl. As well as being the club&#x27;s first major trophy for 15 seasons, the final was also memorable for Middlesex&#x27;s record breaking 187/6 (the highest ever Twenty20 Cup Finals Day score) with Kent&#x27;s retort of 184/5 (being second on the all-time list) and ensured that the Cup was decided on the last ball of the match. The victory is also made historic as Middlesex became the first County Cricket Club to gain entry to both the Twenty20 Champions League and the Stanford Super Series.

However 2008 also saw Middlesex suffer relegation in the Pro40 Division One (finishing in last place). And in a copy of their final standings from the previous season, Middlesex both failed to make it past the group stage in the Friends Provident Trophy and finished in 3rd place in the County Championship Division Two, again missing out on promotion by just one position.
It was announced in February 2009 that Middlesex changed their limited overs name from the Middlesex Crusaders, to the Middlesex Panthers, following complaints made by Muslim and Jewish communities. On 24 October 2014, the club announced that the limited overs name will revert to Middlesex County Cricket Club (Middlesex CCC), with immediate effect.

2011 saw a dramatic improvement in form for Middlesex, as they won the LV= County Championship Division Two for the first time in their history, sealing promotion to Division One for the 2012 season. They narrowly missed out on a place in the CB40 semi-finals, after coming joint top of their group with the Sussex Sharks, missing out only via net run-rate.

In 2016, Middlesex were unbeaten in the County Championship and secured the title on the final day of the season when they defeated one of their main challengers Yorkshire in the title decider at Lord&#x27;s. A defeat for Middlesex in that match would have meant the title going to Yorkshire and a draw would have meant it going to Somerset.

The following season, 2017, Middlesex finished in the bottom two of the County Championship and were subsequently relegated down to the second Division. In 2022 they secured promotion back to the top flight of the County Championship on the penultimate day of the season by finishing runners up to Nottinghamshire in Division two.

== History ==
Calamvale was named after James Calam, an early settler and prominent landowner in the area. The Calam family built their homestead on a hill at the top of Calam Road near Beaudesert Road. The area was known as Calamvale long before it was officially listed as a suburb in 1972. In 1984, the Calams sold the homestead to the McGuire family, who built the Calamvale Hotel on the land. Urbanisation took place in the early 1990s, and development took place in several stages.

Calamvale State School opened on 11 May 1955. In January 2002, a secondary school component was added to the existing primary school to create Calamvale Community College.

In 1977 the Anglican Church of the Holy Spirit began with a small congregation meeting at the library of the Algester State School. In 1979 land was purchased in Algester Road and a kit home was built for a rectory with the first service being conducted on 21 October 1979 with the first baptist being conducted on 4 November 1979. In 1980 St Alban&#x27;s Anglican Church at Acacia Ridge was decommissioned and the church building relocated to the Algester Road site to be used as a parish hall.

== Golden Pond wetlands ==
An eco-friendly feature of Calamvale is the Golden Pond Wetlands attached to Calamvale Creek.

A natural creek (part of a longer channel known as Scrubby Creek, but locally known as Calamvale Creek) and a riparian wetland run through the lower part of Calamvale. In the late 1990s, two constructed wetlands relying on storm water runoff were built upstream of the creek on each side of Golden Avenue. They are known as the Golden Pond wetlands.

The wetlands and creek, collectively called the Golden Pond wetland system, provide a small wildfowl habitat and a storm water &quot;treatment train&quot; designed to improve the quality of storm water runoff as it progresses down the creek.

=== Treatment train ===
The treatment train is made up of several parts, and purifies water as it flows through each part.

An upstream storm water drainage channel runs into a sediment basin, which collects the heaviest sediments and allows better-quality water to flow into Wetland 1. Water flows through a gross pollutant trap into Wetland 2, which was originally a small farm dam on the south side of the Golden Avenue road bridge. Overflow water from Wetland 2 runs into a natural riparian wetland fringed with melaleucas, and this runs into a natural creek with small lagoons.

=== Wildlife ===
The Calamvale wetlands and creek provide a home and a retreat for ducks, egrets, cormorants, spoonbills, herons, water dragons, turtles, eels, and a large number of other wildfowl and animals.

=== Water quality ===
Environmental engineers from Brisbane&#x27;s Griffith University have conducted numerous studies on water quality at the creek and wetlands, and have presented papers at conferences internationally on the design and effectiveness of the treatment train.

== Notable people ==
Actor Russell Dykstra grew up in the suburb, frequently entertaining commuters on the local 141 bus with his self-styled pantomimes while taking the long commute into St Laurence&#x27;s College in South Brisbane as a schoolboy from 1979 to 1981.

<text>Prajadhipok (8 November 1893 – 30 May 1941) was the seventh king of Siam from the Chakri dynasty, titled Rama VII. His reign was a turbulent time for Siam due to political and social changes during the 1932 Siamese revolution. He is to date the only Siamese monarch of the Chakri dynasty to abdicate.

==Early life==

Somdet Chaofa Prajadhipok Sakdidej () was born on 8 November 1893 in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand) to King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha Phongsri. Prince Prajadhipok was the youngest of nine children born to the couple. Overall he was the king&#x27;s second-youngest child (of a total of 77), and the 33rd and youngest of Chulalongkorn&#x27;s sons.

Unlikely to succeed to the throne, Prince Prajadhipok chose to pursue a military career. Like many of the king&#x27;s children, he was sent abroad to study, going to Eton College in 1906, then to the Woolwich Military Academy from which he graduated in 1913. He received a commission in the Royal Horse Artillery in the British Army based in Aldershot. In 1910 Chulalongkorn died and was succeeded by Prajadhipok&#x27;s older brother (also a son of Queen Saovabha), Crown Prince Vajiravudh, who became King Rama VI. Prince Prajadhipok was by then commissioned in both the British Army and the Royal Siamese Army. With the outbreak of the First World War and the declaration of Siamese neutrality, King Vajiravudh ordered his younger brother to resign his British commission and return to Siam immediately, a great embarrassment to the prince, who wanted to serve with his men on the Western front. Once home, Prajadhipok became a high-ranking military official in Siam. In 1917 he was ordained temporarily as a monk, as was customary for most Buddhist Siamese men.

In August 1918 Prince Prajadhipok married his childhood friend and cousin Rambai Barni, a descendant of King Mongkut (Prajadhipok&#x27;s grandfather) and his Royal Consort Piam. They were married at Sukhothai Palace which was a wedding gift to the couple from Queen Saovabha.

After the war in Europe ended, he attended the École Superieure de Guerre in France, returning to Siam to the Siamese military. During this time, he was granted the additional title &quot;Krom Luang Sukhothai&quot; (Prince of Sukhothai). Prajadhipok lived a generally quiet life with his wife at their residence, Sukhothai Palace, next to the Chao Phraya River. The couple had no children. Prajadhipok soon found himself rising rapidly in succession to the throne, as his brothers all died within a relatively short period. In 1925, King Vajiravudh himself died at the age of 44. Prajadhipok became absolute monarch at only thirty-two. He was crowned King of Siam on 25 February 1926.

==Last absolute monarch==
Relatively unprepared for his new responsibilities, Prajadhipok was nevertheless intelligent, diplomatic in his dealings with others, modest, and eager to learn. However, he had inherited serious political and economic problems from his predecessor. The budget was heavily in deficit, and the royal financial accounts were in serious disorder. The entire world was in the throes of the Great Depression.

In an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, Prajadhipok, in what was virtually his first act as king, announced the creation of the Supreme Council of the State of Siam. This council was made up of five experienced members of the royal family, although to emphasise the break with the previous reign the selected five had all fallen out of favour with the previous monarch. The council thus comprised three of the king&#x27;s uncles, Prince Bhanurangsi, Prince Naris and Prince Damrong Rajanubhab and two of his half-brothers, Prince Kitiyakon (Prince Chantaburi) and Prince Boriphat.

Many of the Princes of the Supreme Council felt that it was their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but their acts were not generally appreciated, for the government failed to communicate to the public the purpose of the policies they pursued to rectify Vajiravudh&#x27;s extreme financial extravagances. Gradually these princes arrogated power to themselves, monopolising all the main ministerial positions and appointing their sons and brothers to both administrative and military posts. By April 1926 almost the entire cabinet of ministry heads had been replaced with newly appointed Princes or nobles, with only three former members being re-appointed. While the family appointments brought back men of talent and experience, they also signalled a return to royal oligarchy.

The king clearly wished to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and his choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government. Unlike his predecessor, the king read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens. The king was painstaking and conscientious; he would elicit comments and suggestions from a range of experts and study them, noting the good points in each submission, but when various options were available he would seldom be able to select the best one and abandon others. He would often rely upon the Supreme Council to prod him in a particular direction.
From the beginning of his reign King Prajadhipok was acutely aware that political change was necessary if the monarchy was to be preserved. He viewed his newly established Supreme Council as an institutional check upon the powers of an absolute monarch. During 1926, Prajadhipok experimented with using the Privy Council, which had over 200 members at that time, as a quasi-legislative body. This large of an assembly proved too cumbersome, and in 1927 Prajadhipok created the Committee of the Privy Council consisting of 40 members selected from the royal family or nobility. The committee was received positively by the press and was envisaged as a forerunner of a parliament or National Assembly. In practice however the committee remained relatively unimportant and sadly did not develop into a more powerful or representative body.

In 1926 Prajadhipok wrote a lengthy memorandum to his American adviser Francis B. Sayre titled &quot;Problems of Siam&quot; in which he set forth nine questions he felt were the most serious facing the nation. The third question asked whether Siam should have a parliamentary system, which Prajadhipok doubted. The fourth question asked whether Siam was ready for representative government, to which Prajadhipok answered &quot;my personal opinion is an emphatic NO&quot;. However, the king did see a possibility to introduce reform at the local level as the &quot;next step in our educational move towards democracy&quot;. In 1926 he began moves to develop the concept of &quot;prachaphiban&quot;, or &quot;municipality&quot;, which had emerged late in the fifth reign as a law regarding public health and sanitation. Information was obtained regarding local self-government in surrounding countries, and proposals to allow certain municipalities to raise local taxes and manage their own budgets were drawn up. The fact that the public was not sufficiently educated to make the scheme work militated against the success of this administrative venture. Nevertheless, the idea of teaching the Siamese the concept of democracy through a measure of decentralisation of power in municipalities had become, in Prajadhipok&#x27;s mind, fundamental to future policy-making. However, Yasukichi Yatabe, Japanese minister to Siam, criticized the king&#x27;s way and that it would not be accomplished in a hundred years&#x27; time.
In September 1931 Britain abandoned the gold standard and devalued sterling by 30 percent. This created a crisis for Siam since most of its foreign exchange was held in sterling. The Minister of Finance kept Siam on the gold standard by linking the currency to the US dollar, but debate about this policy raged within the government into 1932. One impact of this policy was that Siam&#x27;s rice exports became more expensive than competitor exporters, negatively impacting revenue.

In mid-October 1931 the king returned from a trip to Canada and the US and ordered Prince Devawongse Varoprakar, the Minister of Foreign Affairs to prepare a constitution. The task of drafting this document was given to the American Raymond B. Stevens and Phaya Sri Wisarn Waja. In March the following year they submitted an &quot;Outline of Changes in the Form of Government&quot; together with their comments. Prajadhipok originally planned to announce the new constitution to the nation of 6 April at the opening of the Memorial Bridge to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Chakri dynasty. These proposals met strong opposition from Prince Damrong and other royal members of the Supreme Council and despite his own misgivings that to not proceed would result in a coup against his government, the king ultimately did not make the planned announcement.

On 20 January 1932, with the country deep in depression, the king convened a &quot;round table&quot; meeting to discuss the many competing arguments and to agree on how to tackle the crisis. From this meeting it was agreed to make large cuts in government spending and implement a retrenchment programme. Two weeks later on 5 February the king addressed a group of military officers and spoke at length about the economic situation. In this speech he remarked &quot;I myself know nothing at all about managing finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best...If I have made a mistake, I believe I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam&quot;. No previous monarch had ever spoken so honestly. The speech was widely reported and many interpreted his words not as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation, but as a sign of weakness and proof that the system of rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished.

==Revolution of 1932==

A small group of soldiers and civil servants began secretly plotting to overthrow absolute monarchy and bring a constitutional government to the kingdom. Their efforts culminated in an almost bloodless &quot;revolution&quot; on the morning of 24 June 1932 by the self-proclaimed Khana Ratsadon (&quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot;; คณะราษฎร). While Prajadhipok was away at Klai Kangwon Palace in Hua Hin, the plotters took control of the Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall in Bangkok and arrested key officials (mainly princes and relatives of the king). The People&#x27;s Party demanded Prajadhipok become a constitutional monarch and grant Thai people a constitution. In the event of a negative response, they reserved the right to declare Siam a republic. The king immediately accepted the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s request and the first &quot;permanent&quot; constitution of Siam was promulgated on 10 December.

Prajadhipok returned to Bangkok on 26 June and received the coup plotters in a royal audience. As they entered the room, Prajadhipok greeted them, saying &quot;I rise in honour of the Khana Ratsadorn.&quot; It was a significant gesture because, according to previous royal rituals, monarchs were to remain seated while their subjects made obeisance, this showed that Prajadhipok was acknowledging the changed circumstances.

==First constitutional monarch==
In the early stages of the constitutional monarchy, the King and the royalists seemed to be able to compromise with Khana Ratsadon. The constitutional bill which was drafted by Pridi Banomyong and intended to be a permanent one was made temporary. The new constitution restored some of the monarch&#x27;s lost power and status. Among them were introduction of unelected half of the House of Representatives and royal veto power. The country&#x27;s first prime minister Phraya Manopakorn Nititada was a conservative and royalist nobleman.

The compromise broke down quickly. He did not contest when his interpretation of Pridi&#x27;s economic plan, which also aim on land reform and seizure of royal land, was released with his signature. The king played a role in the coup d&#x27;état of April 1933, where the House was ordered to close by the prime minister. He signed an order to execute Khana Ratsadon leaders. But Khana Ratsadon&#x27;s military wing leader Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena ousted the government and restored its power.

He played an active role in an anti-revolutionary network, which also aimed to assassinate Khana Ratsadon&#x27;s leaders.

In October 1933, the maverick Prince Boworadej, a former minister of defence, led an armed revolt against the government. In the Boworadet Rebellion, he mobilised several provincial garrisons and marched on Bangkok, occupying the Don Muang aerodrome. Prince Boworadej accused the government of being disrespectful to the monarch and of promoting communism, and demanded that government leaders resign. However, the rebellion ultimately failed.

The king did not directly support the rebellion, but there was a cheque from the treasury to Boworadej. The insurrection diminished the king&#x27;s prestige. When the revolt began, Prajadhipok immediately informed the government that he regretted the strife and civil disturbances. The royal couple then took refuge at Songkhla, in the far south. The king&#x27;s withdrawal from the scene was interpreted by the Khana Ratsadorn as a failure to do his duty. By not throwing his full support behind government forces, he had undermined their trust in him.

In 1934 the Assembly voted to amend civil and military penal codes. The king vetoed the changes to the separation between personal and royal assets as he did not want to pay tax, and protested an amendment to diminish the king&#x27;s consideration of death sentence over the courts. After many losses to Khana Ratsadon, the king seemed to change his stance and expressed support for democracy and blamed Khana Ratsadon for being anti-democratic. However, Phibul later discussed in the House that unelected parliamentary members were the king&#x27;s wish, and another House member criticized the king for being unbearable.

Prajadhipok, whose relations with the Khana Ratsadon had been deteriorating for some time, went on a tour of Europe before visiting England for medical treatment. He continued to correspond with the government regarding the conditions under which he would continue to serve. He tried to retain some of the royal powers, such as power to veto law with no possible override. Other disagreements were on royal assets and royal benefits. After the government did not comply, on 14 October Prajadhipok announced his intention to abdicate unless his requests were met.

===Trip to Europe===
==Abdication==

The People&#x27;s Party rejected the ultimatum, and on 2 March 1935, Prajadhipok abdicated, to be replaced by Ananda Mahidol. Prajadhipok issued a brief statement criticising the regime that included the following phrases, since often quoted by critics of Thailand&#x27;s slow political development.

The former king had good grounds for complaint.

Reaction to the abdication was muted. Stowe wrote that the absolutism of the monarchy had been replaced by that of the People&#x27;s Party, with the military looming in the wings as the ultimate arbiter of power.

==Life after abdication and death==

Prajadhipok spent the rest of his life with Queen Rambhai Barni in England. At the time of abdication, the couple lived at Knowle House, in Surrey, just outside London. However, this house was not suitable considering his health, so they moved to a smaller house in Virginia Water (still in Surrey), but with more space. The house was named &quot;Hangmoor&quot;, but wishing to give it a more pleasant name, he called it &quot;Glen Pammant&quot;, an anagram of an old Thai phrase &quot;tam pleng nam&quot;. They remained there for two years. They moved again to Vane Court, the oldest house in the village of Biddenden in Kent. He led a peaceful life there, gardening in the morning and writing his autobiography in the afternoon.

In 1938 the royal couple moved to Compton House, in the village of Wentworth in Virginia Water, Surrey.

Due to bombing by the German Luftwaffe in 1940, the couple again moved, first to a small house in Devon, and then to Lake Vyrnwy Hotel in Powys, Wales, where the former king had a heart attack.

The couple returned to Compton House, as he expressed his preference to die there. King Prajadhipok died from heart failure on 30 May 1941.

His cremation was held at the Golders Green Crematorium in north London. It was a simple affair attended by just Queen Ramphai and a handful of close relatives. Queen Ramphaiphanni stayed at Compton House for a further eight years before she returned to Thailand in 1949, bringing the king&#x27;s ashes back with her.

==Legacy==
Historian David K. Wyatt writes that Prajadhipok was &quot;a hard-working, effective executor&quot; who was &quot;intellectually equal to the demands of his office&quot;, and whose main failing was to underestimate the Bangkok elite&#x27;s growing nationalism, and that &quot;[a]s late as his death in exile, many would have agreed with his judgement that a move towards democracy in 1932 was premature.&quot; The idea that the 1932 revolution was premature is echoed in a common royalist sentiment that proliferated as the Thai monarchy regained status over ensuing decades. In this view, Prajadhipok is credited as the &quot;father of Thai democracy&quot;, who already intended to usher in democracy before the Khana Ratsadon prematurely carried out their revolution. Prajadhipok&#x27;s abdication statement is often cited in support of this view. Later historians have challenged it as a myth, citing evidence that Prajadhipok&#x27;s political maneuvers leading up to his abdication had more to do with preserving the power and status of the declining monarchy than challenging the Khana Ratsadon&#x27;s actual failures to uphold democratic ideals.

<doc id="822118" wikidata="Q1445812" url="?curid=822118" title="Kussmaul's sign">
<text>Kussmaul&#x27;s sign is a paradoxical rise in jugular venous pressure (JVP) on inspiration, or a failure in the appropriate fall of the JVP with inspiration. It can be seen in some forms of heart disease and is usually indicative of limited right ventricular filling due to right heart dysfunction.

==Pathophysiology==
Ordinarily the JVP falls with inspiration due to reduced pressure in the expanding thoracic cavity and the increased volume afforded to right ventricular expansion during diastole. Kussmaul sign suggests impaired filling of the right ventricle due to a poorly compliant myocardium or pericardium. This impaired filling causes the increased blood flow to back up into the venous system, causing the jugular vein distention (JVD) and is seen clinically in the internal jugular veins becoming more readily visible.

==Causes==
The differential diagnoses of Kussmaul&#x27;s sign includes constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, and severe right-sided heart failure.

With cardiac tamponade, jugular veins are distended and typically show a prominent x descent and an absent y descent as opposed to patients with constrictive pericarditis (prominent x and y descent); see Beck&#x27;s triad.

Other possible causes of Kussmaul&#x27;s sign include:
* Right ventricular infarction - low ventricular compliance
* Cardiac tumours
* Tricuspid stenosis
* Pulmonary embolism

==History==
Kussmaul&#x27;s sign is named after the German doctor who first described it, Adolph Kussmaul (1822–1902). He is also credited with describing Kussmaul breathing.

* Pulsus paradoxus

<doc id="822120" wikidata="Q726206" url="?curid=822120" title="Eric Whitacre">
<text>Eric Edward Whitacre (born January2, 1970) is an American composer, conductor, and speaker best known for his choral music.

== Early life==
Whitacre was born in Reno, Nevada, to Ross and Roxanne Whitacre. He studied piano intermittently as a child and joined a junior high marching band under band leader Jim Burnett. Later Whitacre played a synthesizer in a techno-pop band, dreaming of being a rock star. Although he initially resisted joining choir while attending college, Whitacre was eventually convinced. He described his own experience with his first choral rehearsal as a turning point in his life, saying, &quot;In my entire life I had seen in black and white, and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor. It was the most transformative experience I&#x27;ve ever had—in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony, and people singing...&quot;. Though he was unable to read music at the time, Whitacre began his full musical training while he was an undergraduate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He eventually earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Music Composition.

==Career==
Whitacre studied composition with Ukrainian composer Virko Baley and choral conducting with David B. Weiller, completing his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1995. Whitacre credits Weiller with the inspiration that put the young composer on the musical path. At 21, he wrote his setting of &quot;Go, Lovely Rose&quot; for his college choir and presented the composition as a gift to David Weiller. Whitacre went on to earn his master&#x27;s degree in composition at the Juilliard School, where he studied with John Corigliano and David Diamond. At the age of 23 he completed his first piece for wind orchestra, &quot;Ghost Train&quot;, which has now been recorded more than 40 times. Tom Leslie contributed to his interest in writing for wind ensembles. While at Juilliard he met his future wife, soprano Hila Plitmann, and two of his closest friends, composers Steven Bryant and Jonathan Newman. He lived in Nevada until he was 25. He graduated in 1997 and moved to Los Angeles, and then decided to become a full-time professional composer following the success of &quot;Ghost Train&quot;.

Whitacre&#x27;s first album as both composer and conductor on Decca Records, &quot;Light&amp; Gold&quot;, won a Grammy Award in 2012, and became the No.1 classical album on the US and UK charts within a week of release. Whitacre&#x27;s second album, &quot;Water Night&quot;, was released on Decca in April2012 and featured performances from his professional choir the Eric Whitacre Singers, the London Symphony Orchestra, Julian Lloyd Webber and Hila Plitmann.

Around January 25, 2011, Whitacre began working with film composer Hans Zimmer on the music for &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;. Whitacre co-composed the &quot;Mermaid Theme&quot; with Zimmer as well as conducting some of the choral sessions at Abbey Road Studios. His wife, Hila Plitmann, sang the solo material in the theme, having also invented the language the mermaids were singing in the film, a combination of Latin, Hebrew and, as she says, &#x27;Elvish&#x27;. Whitacre enjoyed working with Zimmer, saying that he was a brilliant composer and a generous collaborator. Whitacre later collaborated with Zimmer for the 2016 film &quot;Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;.

Whitacre has written for the London Symphony Orchestra and London Symphony Chorus, the Los Angeles Master Chorale, Chanticleer, Julian Lloyd Webber and the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Tallis Scholars, the King&#x27;s Singers, Dallas Winds, the Berlin Rundfunkchor, and the Minnesota Orchestra, among others. His work of music theater, &quot;Paradise Lost: Shadows and Wings&quot;, won the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers&#x27; Harold Arlen Award and the Richard Rodgers Award, and earned 10 nominations at the Los Angeles Stage Alliance Ovation Awards. In 2011, he conducted the winning entries of the Abbey Road 80th Anniversary Anthem Competition, recording the London Symphony Orchestra and the Eric Whitacre Singers at Abbey Road Studio1. Whitacre&#x27;s Soaring Leap initiative is a dynamic one-day workshop where singers, conductors, and composers read, rehearse and perform several of his works.

From October to December2010, Whitacre was a visiting fellow at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, during Michaelmas (Autumn) Term. He composed a piece for the college choir, and worked with students in masterclasses and workshops. From 2011 to 2016, he was composer in residence at Sidney Sussex College. Whitacre was appointed artist in residence with the Los Angeles Master Chorale from 2016. In July 2017, he co-presented the Eurovision Choir of the Year.

==Personal life==
From 1998 to 2017, Whitacre was married to Israeli singer Hila Plitmann. They have a son together, Esh Edward (b. 2005).

Whitacre married Belgian opera singer Laurence Servaes in Maui, Hawaii, in March 2019. They have a son together, Julian (b. 2020).

== Style ==

A trademark of Whitacre&#x27;s pieces is the use of aleatoric and indeterminate sections, as well as unusual score instructions involving, in some cases, hand actions or props. His work has been described as &quot;weightless&quot; and as the &quot;sort of music Vaughan Williams might have composed in the Cambridge branch of Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&quot;. Anthony Tommasini described Whitacre&#x27;s &quot;Leonardo Dreams of His Flying Machine&quot; in 2005 as &quot;full of sound effects, portentous harmony and fractured riffs&quot;, writing that &quot;the music was rather hokey, like a choral equivalent of a blatant film score.&quot;

Other critics have described his style as &quot;full of shimmering, shuddering, shifting harmonies that awaken the ear to a contemporary yet accessible voice&quot;. Whitacre&#x27;s style, similar to Morten Lauridsen&#x27;s, has also been characterized as &quot;neo-impressionistic&quot;.

== Projects ==
=== Virtual Choir ===

Whitacre&#x27;s Virtual Choir projects were inspired by a video sent to him of a young girl named Britlin Losee from Glen Cove, New York, singing one of his choral pieces. Singers record and upload their videos from locations all over the world. Each one of the videos is then synchronised and combined into one single performance to create the Virtual Choir. Whitacre began with a test run of &quot;Sleep&quot;, then &quot;Lux Aurumque&quot; in 2009 and then &quot;Sleep&quot; again in 2010. Whitacre&#x27;s Virtual Choir performance of &quot;Lux Aurumque&quot; has received almost 6.5million views (as of July2020), featuring 185 singers from 12 countries.

Whitacre&#x27;s Virtual Choir2.0, &quot;Sleep&quot; was released in April2011 and involved more than 2,000 voices from 58 countries.

Virtual Choir 3, &quot;Water Night&quot;, written in 1995, combined 3,746 submissions from 73 countries and was released in April2012. By the entry close date of February1, 2012, 3,746 videos had been uploaded by 2,945 people in 73 countries, singing one or more parts of &quot;Water Night&quot;. On April 15, the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the &quot;Water Night&quot; Virtual Choir video was shown in the new Titanic Belfast commemorative building.

Virtual Choir4, &quot;Fly to Paradise&quot;, contains 8,409 videos from 5,905 people from 101 countries. It launched at the Coronation Festival at Buckingham Palace/BBC1 on July11, 2013.

The virtual World of Color Honor Choir was put together in 2013 by Whitacre and Disney. The song &quot;Glow&quot; was written for the event. The final product included singers from all over the United States, totaling 1,473 singers.

The Virtual Youth Choir, in association with UNICEF, launched at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. It featured 2,292 singers aged 18 and under from more than 80 countries.

On May 4, 2018, Whitacre announced that Virtual Choir 5 would be his 2015 piece &quot;Deep Field&quot;. Other Virtual Choir projects include &#x27;Glow&#x27; written for the Winter Dreams holiday show at Disneyland Adventure Park, California. To date, the virtual choirs have registered more than 60 million views.

On May 2, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Whitacre announced that the sixth iteration of the Virtual Choir would be an original song entitled &quot;Sing Gently&quot;. It featured 17,572 singers from 129 countries, including 16 performers using Sign Language. It had its world premiere on YouTube on July 19, 2020.

In December 2020, &quot;Sing as One&quot;, an album of Whitacre&#x27;s virtual choirs, was released. The album contains recordings of all eight virtual choirs.

=== &quot;Deep Field&quot; ===
&quot;Deep Field: The Impossible Magnitude of the Universe&quot; is a 4k film for IMAX, cinema, projection in concert with live orchestra and for screenings at arts and science events. It is an audiovisual collaboration between Eric Whitacre, NASA, the Space Telescope Science Institute, Music Productions and 59 Productions. It premiered at Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in 2018 and has since been at Smithsonian Air &amp; Space Museum, Dolby Theatre, the World Science Festival, Griffith Observatory, the American Astronomical Society Annual Meeting and in concert halls. The film is part of several STEAM education programs in North America, Europe and elsewhere.

The film is inspired by the Hubble Space Telescope, and its greatest discovery, the Deep Field image. The soundtrack composed by Whitacre features the Virtual Choir 5, representing 120 countries: more than 8,000 voices aged four to 87, alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Eric Whitacre Singers.

=== Eric Whitacre Singers ===
The choir performs music from the Renaissance through to the current day, including Lauridsen, Britten, and the work of their founder and conductor. The Eric Whitacre Singers made their BBC Proms debut in 2012 in a program that included a collaboration with singer/songwriter Imogen Heap. The choir also sang at the Templeton Prize Laureate Ceremony for Archbishop Desmond Tutu alongside Annie Lennox, and the London African Gospel Choir. They work regularly with British soul artist Laura Mvula, and featured at the iTunes Festival, broadcast to 119 countries, performing with Hans Zimmer, and at an experiential installation for Anya Hindmarch in 2018.

=== Recording projects ===
Whitacre&#x27;s first album with Decca, &quot;Light&amp; Gold&quot;, was released in October2010. This album won the Grammy for Best Choral Performance in 2012. Whitacre&#x27;s second Decca album, &quot;Water Night&quot;, was released in April2012 in the United States.

Since 2013, Whitacre has been releasing on his own independent label, UNQUIET, established as a joint venture with his managers at Music Productions. Feature releases on UNQUIET include &quot;Deep Field&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; and a 10-inch gatefold vinyl featuring Whitacre&#x27;s choral cover of Trent Reznor’s &quot;Hurt&quot; and his setting of E. E. Cummings&#x27; &quot;i carry your heart&quot;.

=== Performance projects ===
On October24, 2010, Whitacre conducted an all-American program with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus at the Barbican London in a performance that featured his commission for the London Symphony Chorus entitled &quot;Songs of Immortality&quot;. In December2010, Whitacre conducted the I Vocalisti choir in Hamburg, and was a guest conductor of the Christmas performance of the Berlin Rundfunkchor. In November2010, Whitacre conducted Côrdydd, a Cardiff-based mixed choir, and friends in a concert of his work at the BBC Hoddinott Hall in the Wales Millennium Centre. He continued to develop his work of music theater, &quot;Paradise Lost: Shadows and Wings&quot;. A concert version was given at Carnegie Hall in 2010.

Whitacre is a founding member of BCM International, a quartet of composers consisting of himself, Steven Bryant, Jonathan Newman, and James Bonney, which aspires to &quot;enrich the wind ensemble repertoire with music unbound by traditional thought or idiomatic cliché.&quot; Whitacre made his BBC Proms debut with a late-night Prom in 2012. In 2015, he returned to the Proms to conduct a program of all-American music with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, BBC Singers, and BBC Chorus. In 2015, Whitacre wrote &quot;Deep Field&quot; for orchestra, chorus, and mobile app; the piece was inspired by the Hubble Deep Field images and audience members play electronica from their smartphone apps.

In June 2014, Whitacre gave a live webcast from the Kennedy Center and subsequently conducted a massed choir of 400 singers on the Mall, Washington D.C., to mark Flag Day and the bicentenary of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

=== &quot;The Sacred Veil&quot; ===
Composed in 2018, &quot;The Sacred Veil&quot; is a 12-movement work from Whitacre and poet/lyricist Charles Anthony Silvestri. Silvestri&#x27;s wife, Julie, died of ovarian cancer at age 36 in 2005, leaving two young children. His texts (written collaboratively with Whitacre) and the score tell a story of courtship, love, loss and the search for solace. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the work as &quot;memorably [celebrating] the precarious beauty of life, offering the welcome consolation of art and a momentary stay against our collective fate.&quot; The work was premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, in February 2019, and recordings released in late August 2020.

== Awards and honors ==
Whitacre has won awards from the Barlow international composition competition, American Choral Directors Association, American Composers Forum and in 2001 became the recipient of The Raymond W. Brock Commission given by the American Choral Directors Association. His work of music theater &quot;Paradise Lost: Shadows and Wings&quot; earned him a Richard Rodgers Award and received 10 nominations at the 2007 Los Angeles Stage Alliance Ovation Awards. The album &quot;Cloudburst and Other Choral Works&quot; received a Grammy nomination in 2007 for Best Choral Performance.

<text>The Battle of Méribel was fought on 28 September 1793 at the village of Méribel, near Sallanches in the modern French department of Haute-Savoie, during the War of the First Coalition. The forces of the Kingdom of Sardinia were defeated by the French Revolutionary Army.

==Background==

Méribel is a hamlet in the present-day commune of Sallanches, in the department of Haute-Savoie. At the time, the territory was part of Mont-Blanc, a French department created in November 1792 after the annexation of Savoy from Sardinia. Sardinia would only recognize the loss of Savoy at the Treaty of Paris (1796).

In August 1793, a 1,000-men Sardinian army engaged in a counter-offensive in the Faucigny against French revolutionary troops. The Coalition armies crossed the Alpine passes to counter the French troops. On 21 August, a first major battle took place at the Saint-Martin bridge, near Sallanches, allowing the Sardinian army to retake the towns of Cluses (24 August) and Bonneville. This attempt to restore the rule of the House of Savoy in the region was, however, short-lived. The following month, the French recaptured the lost territories.

At Cluses on 16 September, French troops commanded by Charles Verdelin attacked the town of Sallanches, where the Sardinian Army had taken refuge. However, the French experienced difficulties in face of an organized defense, including chasseurs, who had taken up position at the Méribel redoubt. The French attack failed. A letter stated, &quot;On 17 September, the French attacked Sallanches but without fruition because we had a good redoubt defended by the chasseurs from the Méribel heights. We also had some cannons. It is said that the enemy here lost nearly 500 of their own.&quot;

On 21 September, Verdelin demanded the population not to revolt again. , who had been sent by the National Convention to accompany the Army of the Alps, had orders from the Committee of Public Safety to take reprisals against the revolting populace. Simond, being originally from the Duchy of Savoy, hesitated, but implemented a purge in Samoëns.

==Battle==

The French army resumed the assault on Sallanches on 27 September. On the 28th they attacked the Méribel redoubt, located about downstream from the town of Saint-Martin-sur-Arve. The redoubt was taken on 29 September. In the evening, the victorious troops of Verdelin and Simond entered Sallanches. 540 people were taken prisoner, while some peasants were executed by firing squad. The Sardinians retreated to the Bonhomme pass. 

==Commemoration==

On 18 September 2004, the Ligue savoisienne unveiled a plaque commemorating the defense of the valley by the Savoyards in face of revolutionary troops.

<text>Farra d&#x27;Isonzo (; ; ; Southeastern Friulian: ) is a (municipality) in the Regional decentralization entity of Gorizia in the Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia.

== History ==

The name &quot;Farra&quot; is of Lombard origin, and derives from &quot;Fara&quot;, meaning &quot;a stronghold held by individual families or clans&quot;. The Romans later had a &quot;statio&quot;—or courier relay point—here, near which they built a bulky bridge on the Isonzo River in a place called Mainizza to improve communications with the eastern territories. It was on this strategic bridge that the Goths, the Ostrogoths, the Lombards, the Avari, the Huns, the Hungarians and the Turks would later pass to invade the empire.

==Economy==

Today Farra is still a thriving center for the numerous vineyards that cover its vast territory. The old agricultural features of the landscape can still be seen in the urban layout of the locality, that includes numerous villages and the two smaller towns of Mainizza and Villanova.

==Main sights==
The palace of Calice (1728) stands out next to the modern buildings that were rebuilt after the war. It is the administrative seat of the &quot;comune&quot; and housed important landowners&#x27; villas. An intense and lively cultural life has developed here, and there are numerous institutions like the centre dedicated the poet Riccardo Pitteri, who wrote about this country and chose it as a summer resort. There is also a retirement home, and in Borgo Grotta there is a museum documenting the agricultural society of the region of Friuli.

In Borgo Zuppini stands the 17th-century Church of the Immaculate Conception, built by Count Giovanni Battista Zuppini between 1665 and 1669. It is the oldest church in the archidiocese named after the Immaculate Conception.

=== Observatory ===

The Farra d&#x27;Isonzo Observatory (, obs.code: 595), where minor planets have been discovered, and a town library are among the other facilities found there.

For several years there has been a renowned musical academy here, promoting an annual chamber music competition for young musicians of the Alpe-Adria, and various concerts are held in the splendid chamber of the parochial oratory. Among other music is the &quot;Gruppo Vocale&quot;, a men&#x27;s choir of recent origin, but already boasting an impressive series of successes with its repertory of classical, popular and religious music.

<doc id="822141" wikidata="Q1073469" url="?curid=822141" title="Jianzhou Jurchens">
<text>The Jianzhou Jurchens () were one of the three major groups of Jurchens as identified by the Ming dynasty. Although the geographic location of the Jianzhou Jurchens changed throughout history, during the 14th century they were located south of the Wild Jurchens and the Haixi Jurchens, and inhabited modern-day Liaoning and Jilin provinces in China. The Jianzhou Jurchens were known to possess an abundant supply of natural resources. They also possessed industrial secrets, particularly in processing ginseng and the dyeing of cloth. They were powerful due to their proximity to Ming trading towns such as Fushun, Kaiyuan, and Tieling in Liaodong, and to Manpojin camp near Korea.

== Origins ==
According to Pamela Crossley, a historian specializing in Manchu history, the origin of the name Jianzhou is contested. Xu Zhongsha thought it was derived from the region of Parhae, from the Songari and Hun Rivers. Japanese scholars disagree and state that the name was created from the migrating Jurchens, near the present border with Korea.

After the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, pockets of Yuan loyalists retreated to the northeast. In 1375, a former Yuan official Naghachu residing in Liaoyang province invaded Liaodong with the hope of restoring the Yuan dynasty. After he was defeated in 1387, the Ming began reorganizing the Jurchens in Liaodong to protect the Ming border region from further incursions. Various Jurchen groups had migrated south and three tribes settled themselves around the Tumen River near the modern border of China, Russia, and North Korea.

The Jianzhou Jurchen originate partially from the Huligai who were classified by the Liao dynasty as a separate ethnicity from the Jurchen people who founded the Jin dynasty and were classified as separate from Jurchens during the Yuan dynasty. Their home was in the lower reaches of the Songhua River and Mudanjiang. The Huligai later moved west and became a major component of the Jianzhou Jurchens led by Mentemu during the Ming dynasty, and the Jianzhou Jurchens later became Manchus. The Jurchens during the Ming dynasty lived in Jilin. According to the records of Ming Dynasty officials, the Jianzhou Jurchen was descended from Mohe people who established Balhae Kingdom.

The Taowen, Huligai, and Wodolian Jurchen tribes lived in the area of Heilongjiang in Yilan during the Yuan dynasty when it was part of Liaoyang province and governed as a circuit. These tribes became the Jianzhou Jurchens in the Ming dynasty. In the Jin dynasty, the Jin Jurchens did not regard themselves as the same tribes as the Hurka people who became the Huligai. Uriangqa was used as a name in the 1300s by Jurchen migrants in Korea from Ilantumen because the Uriangqa influenced the people at Ilantumen. Bokujiang, Tuowulian, Woduolian, Huligai, Taowan separately made up 30,000 households and were the divisions used by the Yuan dynasty to govern the people along the Wusuli river and Songhua area. In the Jin dynasty the Shangjing route 上京路 governed the Huligai. A Huligai route was created as well by the Jin.

In 1388, the Hongwu Emperor established contact with three tribes of Ilan Tumen in modern Yilan County near the confluence of the Mudanjiang River and the Songhua River. The Odori, Huligai (Hūrha or Hurka) and Tuowen Jurchens were enlisted as allies against the Mongols. Jurchens began accepting Ming titles. Ahacu, chief of the Huligai, became commander of the Jianzhou Guard in 1403, named after a Yuan Dynasty political unit in the area. Möngke Temür (猛哥帖木儿) of the Odoli became the leader of the Jianzhou Left Guard and accepted the Chinese surname of Tong not long afterward. The two Jianzhou guards engaged in trade with the Ming at the designated market of Kaiyuan and Fushun. They undertook several short-term moves west, battling the Wild Jurchens of the north and the Koreans to their south. Jurchen raids into Korean territory brought about joint Korean-Ming counterattacks in 1467 and 1478 which severely weakened the Jianzhou Jurchens.

Jianzhou Jurchens adopted agriculture during the Ming dynasty when they acquired knowledge of fertilization, draft animals, and iron plows as they moved south closer to Asian agricultural civilizations. Iron-smelting and mining knowledge was acquired by the Jurchens from 1599 after they bought iron plowshares from the Chinese and learned how to turn iron into weapons from Koreans.

== Confederation building ==
By the mid-sixteenth century, the Ming guard structure had mostly disappeared and the Jurchens were split between two confederations: the Haixi Jurchens and the Jianzhou Jurchens. The Jianzhou confederates continued to live north of the Yalu River in five tribes: the Suksuhu River tribe, Hunehe, Wanggiya, Donggo, and Jecen. Under the leadership of Wang Gao, the confederation raided the Ming frontier and even killed the Ming commander at Fushun in 1473. A major counterattack by the Chinese ended in the death of Wang Gao and the dissolution of the confederation.

In 1582, the Jianzhou confederation was met by the Ming military who launched a campaign which intended to stabilize the disintegrating confederation. The chieftain Nikan Wailan allied with the Ming general Li Chengliang against Wang Gao&#x27;s son Atai. Giocangga, chief of the Beiles of the Sixes, was originally under Li&#x27;s command since his grandson, the young Nurhaci was under his hostage. But Giocangga later chose to oppose Nikan Wailan and took his fourth son Taksi to support Atai at his stronghold Fort Gure. The battle at Gure, claimed Atai, Giocangga, and Taksi&#x27;s lives.

A number of leaders within the Suksuhu tribe stood ready to take Nurhaci&#x27;s place. However, Nurhaci eventually rose to power.

== Nurhaci and leadership of Jianzhou Jurchens ==

Taking control of his grandfather&#x27;s Suksuhu River tribe, Nurhaci confronted the Ming and released the Seven Grievances. Nurhaci sought vengeance for the untimely deaths of his immediate family members and a vendetta against the Ming forces who took his father and grandfather&#x27;s life was launched. Although the Ming were reluctant, Nikan Wailan was eventually held responsible for the deaths of Giocangga and Taksi, and was killed in 1586. The Ming claimed that their deaths were accidental and not part of the campaign. Afterwards, Li Chengliang even acted as a surrogate father. Nurhaci may have had actually lived within Li Chengliang&#x27;s household in Fushun in his youth and perhaps gained his literacy in Chinese as a result of this experience. Nurhaci would later be responsible for unifying the Jurchens confederacies.

The leadership of the Jianzhou confederacies found its lineage from the Odori Jurchens whose leader Mongke Temur was renown by both the Ming and by the Yi. Giocangga, Nurgaci grandfather, claimed to be a fourth-generation descendant of Mongke Temur. The elite members of the Jurchen lineage possessed the Chinese characters for Jiagu in their names. In 1588 Nurhaci brought the Wanggiya tribe and Donggo tribe together. The unification of the Jianzhou Jurchens became a stepping stone for Nurhaci to expand his power throughout southern and central Manchuria, and to create a truly unified Manchu state. The very name Manchu (Jurchen: manju) was perhaps an old term for the Jianzhou Jurchens.

== Language == 
Unlike the Jurchen people, who spoke the Jin Jurchen language that was adopted from phonetic Kitan language established in the Jin dynasty, the Jianzhou Jurchens commonly used three different language: Jurchen, Mongolian and Chinese. According to the Qing imperial history, the Jianzhou leader Nurgaci sought to devise a suitable system that integrated the phonetic Mongolian and Jurchen language. This resulted in the creation of the Manchu language, which would later be deemed one of the greatest inventions that sparked the unification of Manchuria. However, for some time the script was not well received and the Jianzhou continued to use Mongolian as their lingua franca.

== Relationship with the Joseon dynasty ==
The Korean Joseon dynasty, incepted in the 1300s, had considered some Jurchen headmen as useful allies. Jurchens were positioned as far south as Hamhung in north central Korea since the 12th century. However, the Yi order in Korea included intense military campaigns to drive Jurchens northward toward the Yalu River and ultimately beyond it, into present-day Manchuria.

One of the most vivid narratives and depictions of the Jianzhou comes from a passage supplied by Sin Chun-li. Sin Chun-li&#x27;s mission to the Jianzhou Jurchens was aimed to resolve the incident of 1594, in which the Jianzhou Jurchens captured at least seventeen Koreans and were being held for ransom. To resolve the issue, Sin was dispatched by the Korean court to Nurgaci&#x27;s capital at Fe Ala. He and a small party of Korean officials crossed the Yalu river at Mamp Ojin, and followed a tributaries northwest to the Suksu Valley where Nurhaci was based.

Sin kept a detailed written record of his journey as he moved through Jianzhou Jurchen confederation. Despite it being winter, his insights tell us that the Jianzhou land was abundant with rivers, forests, and saw industrialization. Sin stratified his findings and stated that the Jianzhou Jurchen divided their society into villages of about twenty households or less, which were clustered along forested riverbanks. They lived off of the river and its surrounding terrain.

== Relationship with the Ming dynasty == 

The Jianzhou Jurchens, and other Jurchen groups were often in contention with the Ming and Yi for rights to trade. They often contended at Nurgan and Liaodong, which were politically and culturally marked territories before the Conquest of Qing China. However, there was also simultaneously cohesion, which was reflected in the scheduled visits of Jurchen leaders to Peking to &quot;make ritual obeisance&quot; to the Ming emperor. These visits were to satisfy the Ming tributary system. Conversely, it helped the Ming establish a list of Jurchen elites and military occupancies, but also deescalated tensions between the two groups. Nurgaci conducted at least two of the tributaries - one with his father at a young age and another led by himself. There, as early as 1580, he echoed the Jianzhou Jurchen elite&#x27;s frustrations with the Ming officials in Liaodong. He established his grievances that the Ming officials were corrupt and often interfered with trading. However, the Jurchen were not viewed as a threat at this time by the Ming.

The change of the name from Jurchen to Manchu was made to hide the fact that the ancestors of the Manchus, the Jianzhou Jurchens, were ruled by the Chinese. The Qing dynasty carefully hide the 2 original editions of the books of &quot;&quot;Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu&quot; and the &quot;Manzhou Shilu Tu&quot;&quot; (Taizu Shilu Tu) in the Qing palace, forbidden from public view because they showed that the Manchu Aisin Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty. In the Ming period, the Koreans of Joseon referred to the Jurchen inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen to be part of Ming China, as the &quot;superior country&quot; (sangguk) which they called Ming China. The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, from the History of Ming to hide their former subservient relationship to the Ming. The Veritable Records of Ming were not used to source content on Jurchens during Ming rule in the History of Ming because of this.

== Trading along the border == 

When Nurgaci came to power, he implemented a strengthening of the Jianzhou Jurchen&#x27;s by way of amassing agricultural laborers. This was achieved in part through the kidnapping of farmers living in border regions. However, unlike previous rulers, the Jianzhou Jurchens under Nurhaci provided shelter and gave other benefits and resources to these farmers which helped ease assimilation and established their allegiance to Nurhaci&#x27;s regime.

Fushan was an &quot;Tong ancestral town&quot; and during the early 17th century, it was fortified by the Ming since it served as Liaodong&#x27;s border that met with Nurgan - territories occupied by the Haixi, Jianzhou, and wild Jurchens. Fushan was the primacy licensed center for the trade, particularly renown for cured ginseng, horse trade, and dyed clothing. Fushan was also a primary location for Jianzhou embassy members who were conducting tributary missions to stop for entertainment and refreshments.

In 1618, Nurhaci&#x27;s forces captured Fushun. This escalated tensions and in 1621, the Jianzhou Jurchens broke out in warfare with the Ming in Liaodong in which Nurhaci fought with Xiong Tingbi (1569–1625), the Ming military commander. By this time, he had declared a unified Jurchen regime that called itself &quot;Jin,&quot; reminiscent of the former Jurchen empire. From this warfare, the Ming grew increasingly aware of Nurhaci&#x27;s increasing and tremendous military power. Nurhaci, in 1622, convinced Mongols who were supporting the Ming&#x27;s military efforts, to abandon their posts and it resulted in a disastrous defeat for the Ming at Guangning. Nurhaci&#x27;s troops soon occupied Shenyang, the former Ming provincial capitol. This battle helped strengthen the Jianzhou and established more relationships with surrounding groups.

<text>Gainsborough Pictures was a British film studio based on the south bank of the Regent&#x27;s Canal, in Poole Street, Hoxton in the former Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch, northeast London. Gainsborough Studios was active between 1924 and 1951. The company was initially based at Islington Studios, which were built as a power station for the Great Northern &amp; City Railway and later converted to studios.

Other films were made at Lime Grove and Pinewood Studios. The former Islington studio was converted to flats in 2004 and a London Borough of Hackney historical plaque is attached to the building. The studio is best remembered for the Gainsborough melodramas it produced in the 1940s.

Gainsborough Pictures is now owned by Gregory Motton.

==History==
Gainsborough was founded in 1924 by Michael Balcon and, from 1927, was a sister company to the Gaumont British, with Balcon as Director of Production for both studios. Whilst Gaumont-British, based at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, produced the &quot;quality&quot; pictures, Gainsborough mainly produced &#x27;B&#x27; movies and melodramas at its Islington Studios. Both studios used continental film practices, especially those from Germany, with Alfred Hitchcock being encouraged by Balcon — who had links with UFA — to study there and make multilingual co-production films with UFA, before World War II. In the 1930s, actors Elisabeth Bergner and Conrad Veidt, art director Alfred Junge, cinematographer Mutz Greenbaum and screenwriter/director Berthold Viertel, along with others, joined the two studios.

The studio&#x27;s opening logo, of a lady (Celia Bird then Glennis Lorimer) in a Georgian era period costume, sitting in an ornate frame, and turning and smiling, was based on the portrait of Sarah Siddons by Thomas Gainsborough. The short piece of music was written by Louis Levy and called the &quot;Gainsborough Minuet&quot;.

After the departure of Balcon to MGM-British, the Rank Organisation gained an interest in Gainsborough and the studio made such popular films as &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot; (1937) and Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938). By 1937, Gaumont-British was in financial crisis, and closed its Lime Grove studios, moving all production to the Islington Poole Street studio. However, the tall factory chimney on the site was considered dangerous in the event of bombing during World War II, and so Gainsborough Studios was evacuated to Lime Grove for the duration of hostilities. Heads of the studio were Edward Black and Maurice Ostrer.

From 1943 to 1946, Gainsborough produced a series of studio-bound costume melodramas for the domestic market, which became known collectively as the Gainsborough melodramas. They were mostly based on recent popular books by female novelists. Prominent titles included &quot;The Man in Grey&quot; (1943), &quot;Madonna of the Seven Moons&quot; (1944), &quot;Fanny by Gaslight&quot; (1944), &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945) and &quot;Caravan&quot; (1946). The films featured a stable of leading British actors, among them Margaret Lockwood, James Mason, Stewart Granger and Patricia Roc. The studio also made modern-dress comedies and melodramas such as &quot;Love Story&quot; (1944), &quot;Two Thousand Women&quot; (1944), &quot;Time Flies&quot; (starring Tommy Handley, 1944), &quot;Bees in Paradise&quot; (with Arthur Askey directed by Val Guest, 1944), &quot;They Were Sisters&quot; (1945), and &quot;Easy Money&quot; (1948).

Subsequent productions, overseen by Betty Box (who at the time was the only female producer in British cinema), included the neo-realist &quot;Holiday Camp&quot; (1947), &quot;Miranda&quot; (1948) and the Huggett family series, with Jack Warner, Kathleen Harrison, and Petula Clark, who had been introduced in &quot;Holiday Camp&quot;. Unhappy with the performance of the studio, Rank closed it down in early 1949. Production was concentrated at Pinewood Studios. Although films continued to be made there under the Gainsborough banner, that quickly ceased, and no further Gainsborough films were released after 1951. It was revived in 1987 and made the television film, &quot;A Hazard of Hearts&quot;.

==Demolition==
The original Lime Grove site was taken over by the BBC in 1949 and remained in use until it was closed in 1991. The buildings were demolished in the early 1990s, and have been since replaced with housing presently called Gaumont Terrace and Gainsborough Court.

The former Islington Studios, in Poole Street, remained largely derelict after their closure in 1949 apart from occasional art performances, including two epic Shakespearean productions by the Almeida Theatre Company, April–July 2000, directed by Jonathan Kent and starring Ralph Fiennes, and a closing Hitchcock season in October 2003.
The buildings began to be cleared in 2002, and apartments named Gainsborough Studios were built on the site in 2004 by architects Munkenbeck and Marshall.

<text>A divisional court, in relation to the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, means a court sitting with at least two judges. Matters heard by a divisional court include some criminal cases in the High Court (including appeals from magistrates&#x27; courts and in extradition proceedings) as well as certain judicial review cases. Although often referred to in practice as &quot;the&quot; Divisional Court, a divisional court is in fact not a separate court or division of the High Court but essentially refers to the number of judges sitting. Usually a divisional court sits with two judges but occasionally the bench comprises three judges.

The best known divisional court is that of the Administrative Court, which is a specialist court in the King&#x27;s Bench Division which deals with judicial review claims, some criminal appeals (including by case stated) and writs of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. There are also divisional courts of the Family and Chancery Divisions to deal with certain cases.

The usual constitution of a divisional court is one Lord Justice of Appeal and one High Court judge, in comparison to other sittings of the High Court which are usually before a single High Court judge.
