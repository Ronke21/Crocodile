<text>Nicolas Lancret (; 22 January 1690 – 14 September 1743) was a French painter. Born in Paris, he was a brilliant depicter of light comedy which reflected the tastes and manners of French society during the regency of the Duke of Orleans and, later, early reign of King Louis XV.
==Career==
Lancret&#x27;s first master was Pierre d&#x27;Ulin, but his acquaintance with and admiration for Watteau induced him to leave Ulin for Gillot, whose pupil Watteau had been. Lancret, who remained a pupil of Gillot from 1712–1713, was heavily influenced by the older painter, whose typical slender figures can be found in many of his pupil&#x27;s younger works. Two pictures painted by Lancret and exhibited on the Place Dauphine had a great success, which laid the foundation of his fortune, and, it is said, estranged Watteau, who had been complimented as their author. In 1718 he was received as an Academician, from thereon becoming a very respected artist, especially amongst the admirers of Watteau. He completed works to decorate the Palace of Versailles, while his style was later to prove popular with Frederick the Great. Lancret&#x27;s popularity was reflected by the decision to make him a councillor at the Academie in 1735.

==Work, style and legacy==

Lancret completed numerous paintings, a significant proportion of which (over eighty) were engraved. Although he completed several portraits and historical pieces his favourite subjects were balls, fairs, village weddings and so forth. In this respect he was typical of Rococo artists. Some have claimed Lancret&#x27;s work is significantly inferior to that of Watteau. In drawing and in painting his touch is often considered intelligent but dry; art historian Michael Levey remarked that Lancret was &#x27;no poet but a charming essayist&#x27;. Lancret&#x27;s characteristics are due possibly to the fact that he had been for some time in training under an engraver.

It is generally considered that the artist produced his best work towards the latter end of his life, displaying, in the minds of several art historians, an increasing ability to create a sense of harmony between art and nature, as in &quot;Montreir de lanterne magique&quot;, and a willingness to lend his, now bulkier, figures a firmer place in his compositions. These changes displayed the influence of later Watteaus like &quot;L&#x27;Enseigne de Gersaint&quot;. Lancret&#x27;s last painting, &quot;Family in a Garden&quot;, The National Gallery, is considered by Levey to be his &#x27;masterpiece&#x27;. The scene, which depicts a family taking coffee, has an intimacy and hint of humour that are considered captivating. The work&#x27;s flowing lines, Rococoesque harmony of pastel colours, painterly style and charming subject matter (of a wide eyed young girl, surrounded by her happy family and natural, yet un-threatening setting, trying her first taste of coffee) are seen to display a delicate sense of vitality and freshness that anticipate the works of both Thomas Gainsborough and Jean-Honoré Fragonard.

The British Museum possesses an admirable series of studies by Lancret in red chalk, and the National Gallery, London, shows four paintings—the &quot;Four Ages of Man&quot; (engraved by Desplaces and l&#x27;Armessin), cited by d&#x27;Argenville amongst the principal works of Lancret.

==Personal life==

Lancret was single for much of his life; however in 1741 he married the 18-year-old grandchild of Boursault, author of &quot;Aesop at Court&quot;. Supposedly Lancret was induced to marry her after finding her and her dying mother living in poverty in an attic room and hearing that the daughter was soon to be compelled to enter a convent. Lancret died of pneumonia on 14 September 1743.

<text>CRG is a kart chassis manufacturer. Notable members include Alex Zanardi, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Lewis Hamilton, and Max Verstappen.

CRG was founded by three Italian racers (Carlo Vanaria, Roberto Vanaria and Giancarlo Tinini), and was originally known as Kali Karts. In the beginning, the company was viewed as unfavorable, with Zanardi being told by his original team, DAP, that if he didn&#x27;t stop complaining they would &quot;send him to Kali&quot;. By the mid 1980s, Kali had recovered from its inauspicious beginnings and was winning world championships with drivers including Mike Wilson.

Kali changed its name to CRG in the 1986. They soon competed in more world championships with drivers including Danilo Rossi and Alessandro Manetti. CRG also goes under the name of Tinini Group, which was created in 2017, which is now visible on all sticker kits. CRG has also relations with Dino Chiesa (Chiesa Corse); the notable Italian chassis mechanic assisted multiple world champions as well as many other drivers through CRG.

CRG began building engines in the mid-1990s, but they were never widely used outside of the factory teams. In 2001, they were replaced by the Maxter brand which produces 100 cc and 125 cc gearbox engines. They also have been involved in the Maxter engine range. They were also the main supplier for brands including Maranello, Vanspeed, Zanardi, Dino, and DR Kart. In recent years, the team has partnered with TM racing.

In the past 30 years, CRG has been one of the most successful brands and has been chosen by several current motorsport champions. For this reason, CRG Racing team is considered the “Champions Factory”. Drivers such as Michael Schumacher (for Kali), Max Verstappen, Alex Zanardi, Ralf Schumacher, Giancarlo Fisichella, and others have competed for the brand.

<doc id="838334" wikidata="Q3047696" url="?curid=838334" title="Edmé Boursault">
<text>Edmé Boursault (October 163815 September 1701) was a French dramatist and miscellaneous writer, born at Mussy l&#x27;Evéque, now Mussy-sur-Seine (Aube).

==Biography==
On Boursault&#x27;s first arrival in Paris in 1651 his language was limited to Burgundian, but within a year he had produced his first comedy, &quot;Le Mort vivant&quot; (Living Death).

This and some other pieces of small merit secured for him distinguished patronage in the society ridiculed by Molière in the &quot;Ecole des femmes&quot;. Boursault was persuaded that the Lysidas of that play was a caricature of himself, and attacked Molière in &quot;Le Portrait du peintre ou la contre-critique de l&#x27;Ecole des femmes&quot; (1663). Molière retaliated in &quot;L&#x27;Impromptu de Versailles&quot;, and Boileau attacked Boursault in Satires 7 and 9. Boursault replied to Boileau in his &quot;Satire des satires&quot; (1669), but was afterwards reconciled to him, when Boileau on his side erased his name from his satires.

Boursault obtained a considerable pension as editor of a rhyming gazette, which was, however, suppressed for ridiculing a Capuchin friar, and the editor was only saved from the Bastille by the interposition of Condé. In 1671 he produced a work of edification in &quot;Ad usum Delphini: la veritable étude des souverains&quot;, which so pleased the court that its author was about to be made assistant tutor to Louis, Grand Dauphin when it was found that he was ignorant of Greek and Latin. The post then went to Pierre Huet, but perhaps in compensation, Boursault was made collector of taxes at Montluçon about 1672, an appointment that he retained until 1688.
Among his best-known plays are &quot;Le Mercure galant&quot;, the title of which was changed to &quot;La Comédie sans titre&quot; (&quot;Play without a title&quot;, 1683) when the publisher of a literary review of the same name objected (see &quot;Mercure de France&quot;); &quot;La Princesse de Clêves&quot; (1676), an unsuccessful play which, when refurbished with fresh names by its author, succeeded as &quot;Germanicus&quot;; &quot;Esope à la ville&quot; (1690); and &quot;Esope à la cour&quot; (1701). His lack of dramatic instinct could hardly be better indicated than by the scheme of his &quot;Esope&quot;, which allows the fabulist to come on the stage in each scene and recite a fable.

Boursault died in Paris on 15 September 1701. His &quot;Œuvres choisies&quot; were published in 1811, and a sketch of him can be found in Saint-René Taillandier&#x27;s &quot;Etudes littéraires&quot; (1881).

==Partial list of works==
===Drama===
*&quot;Le Mort Vivant&quot; (English:The Living Dead Man, 1662). A three-act comedy.
*&quot;Portrait of the Painter, or Criticisms of the School for Women Criticized&quot; (French: &quot;Le Portrait du Peintre ou La Contre-critique de L’École des femmes&quot;, September 1663). Part of an ongoing literary quarrel over &quot;The School for Wives&quot; (1662) by Molière. The original play had caricatured &quot;male-dominated exploitative marital relationships&quot;, and became a target of criticism. Criticisms ranged from accusing the playwright of impiety, to nitpicking over the perceived lack of realism in certain scenes. Molière had answered his critics with a second play, &quot;The School for Women Criticized&quot; (French: &quot;La Critique de L’École des femmes&quot;, June 1663). Boursault wrote his play in answer to this second play. In &quot;The School for Women Criticized&quot;, Molière poked fun at his critics by having their arguments expressed on stage by comical fools. While the character defending the original play, a mouthpiece for the writer, is a straight man with serious and thoughtful replies. In his &quot;Portrait&quot;, Boursault imitates the structure of Molière&#x27;s play but subjects the characters to a role reversal. In other words, the critics of Molière are featured as serious and his defenders as fools. There is some question on the motivations of Boursault in getting involved in the quarrel. The character Lysidas, with which he took offense, may not have represented Boursault himself but his mentor Thomas Corneille. The play in its extant published form may differ considerably from its original staged version. The vulgar &quot;Chanson de la Coquille&quot; (&quot;Song of the Shell&quot;), which targeted Madeleine Béjart for her age and sexual history, seems to have been first used in the stage version of the &quot;Portrait&quot; and then re-used by Jean Donneau de Visé. Boursault probably included other malicious and personal attacks on Molière and his associates in the stage version, which were edited out in time for publication. The modern scholar can only guess at their nature by Molière&#x27;s haste to respond. Molière answered with a third play of his own, &quot;The Versailles Impromptu&quot; (French: &quot;L&#x27;Impromptu de Versailles&quot;, October 1663), which reportedly took him only eight days to write. It went on stage two weeks (or less) after the &quot;Portrait&quot;. This play takes place in the theatrical world, featuring actors playing actors on stage. Among jests aimed at various targets, Molière mocks Boursault for his obscurity. The characters have trouble even remembering the name of someone called &quot;Brossaut&quot;. Molière further taunts the upstart as &quot;a publicity-seeking hack&quot;. 
*&quot;Les Cadenats, ou le Jaloux Endormi&quot; (English: &quot;The locks, or the jealous one asleep&quot;, 1663). A one-act comedy. A theatrical work involving a &quot;girdle of chastity&quot; (chastity belt). Eric Dingwall considered it &quot;in places both dull and tedious&quot;.
*&quot;Les Nicandres, ou Les Menteurs qui ne mentent point&quot; (English: &quot;The Nicandres, or The Liars who do not lie&quot;, 1664). A comedy. A play about two identical twin brothers, who also use the same name: &quot;Nicandre&quot; (Nicander). There are constant confusions over their identities, and &quot;ludicrous mistakes and misunderstandings&quot; result from the fact that their own mistresses and valets can not tell them apart. The plot and its humor are similar, though not identical, to &quot;Menaechmi&quot; by Plautus. John Colin Dunlop lists it among several French imitations of the ancient play, noting that the earliest among them was a 1630s version by Jean Rotrou.
*&quot;The Flying Doctor&quot; (French:&quot;Le médecin volant&quot;, 1664). This work went on stage in October 1664, and received its first publication in 1665. Boursault claimed to have translated this work from an Italian original. Molière also staged, but did not publish, an identical-named play in 1664. A number of scholars have theorized that Boursault was directly influenced by Molière&#x27;s version. Comparisons of the two plays have revealed near-identical plots, but also substantial differences. These range from the names and occupations of various characters to different takes on certain scenes. A number of phrases used in both plays seem to point to a common source for both works. Some scenes seem more developed in Boursault&#x27;s version, possibly because of his attempt to closely follow the Italian original. His personal touches are evident in other ways. His characters speak in verse, and the dialogue at times includes allusions to the works of French dramatists. For example, to &quot;Polyeucte&quot; (1643) by Pierre Corneille, &quot;La Belle plaideuse&quot; (1655) by François le Métel de Boisrobert, and possibly &quot;Les Précieuses ridicules&quot; (1659) by Molière. While both identical-named plays feature an impostor doctor, Boursault also adds a real one as an object or satire and ridicule. There is some confusion over the reception of the work. There are references to &quot;Le médecin volant&quot; receiving a Dutch translation in 1666, entering the repertory of provincial theaters in 1668, and being regularly staged by the Comédie-Française from 1685 to 1687. But the primary sources rarely make the distinction between the two plays, so whether it was Molière&#x27;s or Boursault&#x27;s version who had enduring success is uncertain.
*&quot;Les Yeux de Philis changés en astres&quot; (English:&quot;Metamorphosis of Phyllis&#x27; eyes into stars&quot;, 1665). A pastoral drama, in three-acts. It was first staged by the Troupe royale in the Hôtel de Bourgogne. It was based on the 1639 poem of the same name by Germain Habert. The original poem was rather short at c. 600 lines, depicting the love story of Daphnis and Phyllis. Boursault initially planned to dramatize all its verses, and to add short scenes connecting the major ones to each other. Realizing that the play lacked in action, Boursault added more characters and subplots. He retained the basic three characters of the original: Daphnis, Phyllis, and Helios/Sol (French:Soleil for Sun). He then created a secondary couple in the persons of Lisis, brother to Phyllis, and Carite, sister to Daphnis. A major departure from the original was the intervention of the gods. The action takes place in the island of Delos and the Sun is identified with Apollo. He too loves Phillis and his love is rejected. He first asks his sister Artemis/Diana to intervene on his behalf, to little effect. But the new couple has to drink from a certain spring for their nuptials, and Hermes/Mercury assists Apollo by poisoning it. Daphnis is fatally poisoned and Phyllis weeps. Eros/Cupid and Hymen then jointly plead to Zeus/Jupiter for justice. He is sufficiently moved to carry off Phillis to the heavens, where she and Daphnis can re-unite. The eyes of the young woman turn into the twin stars of Gemini. Boursault reported that he chose to limit the play to three acts, because in his observation four-act and five-act plays tend to fatigue the audience. The entire plot takes place in less than 24 hours, leaving little room for further intrigue or character study. &quot;The verse is polished and correct, but conventional and monotonous&quot;. Certain scenes call for spectacular effects, such as the heavens opening and gods appearing to dictate their wishes, sounds of thunder, and the earth itself trembling. Others scenes rely on music and singing. Boursault likely counted on these scenes to be the highlights of the work.
*&quot;The Satire of Satires&quot; (French: &quot;La satire des satires&quot;, 1668/1669). A one-act play, written in response to criticisms by Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux. In his &quot;Satire VII&quot;, Boileau had included Boursault in a list of bad poets. A list which included several obscure figures and possible made-up names. (For example, &quot;Titreville&quot; is mentioned only in Satire VII and Satire IX. There is no other source on his existence.) Since Boileau had briefly targeted Boursault in his satires, Boursault evidently wanted to respond in kind. Boileau managed to prevent the staging of this play by an act of parlement. Years later, the two writers befriended each other. In response, Boileau edited the text of his satire to instead target Jacques Pradon. This altered version survived in subsequent editions of his work. The incident sheds some light on the legal limitations of theatrical satire at the time. The decision of parlement (dated to 22 October 1668) objected to the use of the proper name of Boileau, proclaiming that the practice was &quot;defamatory of the honor&quot; of the suppliant and therefore illegal. Larry Norman also points that direct satire was a controversial literary topic at the time. François Hédelin, abbé d&#x27;Aubignac criticized Old Comedy, mainly represented by Aristophanes, for mixing his narrative with public affairs. Boileau himself would later comment on the vices of Old Comedy which turned Socrates to a laughingstock for the &quot;vile masses&quot; of Athens. This sympathy for Socrates might have been connected to his own treatment at the pen of Boursault.
*&quot;Germanicus&quot; (1673). A tragedy, based on Ancient Rome. The titular character is Germanicus, nephew of Tiberius. The other featured characters include (1)Drusus Julius Caesar, son of Tiberius, (2)Agrippina the Elder, daughter to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and granddaughter of Augustus, (3)Livilla, sister of Germanicus, (4) Pison, a Roman chevalier (member of the Roman equestrian order). Possibly named after the Piso family, (5)Flavia, a confidant to Agripinna, (6)Albinus, a confidant to Germanicus, and (7)Flavian, a confidant to Pison. While successful at the time of its release, the tragedy went on to gain a reputation as an &quot;indifferent work&quot;. Its main claim to fame has to do with indirectly causing a quarrel between two other writers. While congratulating Boursault for his play, Pierre Corneille commented that it only needed the signature of Jean Racine &quot;to be deemed a great work&quot;. The comparison between Boursault and Racine pleased the former and infuriated the latter. Resulting in a verbal fight between Corneille and Racine. The two opponents were not on speaking terms afterwards.
*&quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot; (English: The Princess of Clèves, December 1678). It was written for the Guénégaud Theatre, and proved a flop. Only two performances were staged. It was obviously based on the novel of the same name (1678) by Madame de La Fayette. The play is a lost work, and there are some doubts on its existence. The main source about it seems to be a 1697 letter from the correspondence of an aging Boursault. He claimed to have reused part of its material for &quot;Germanicus&quot;. But there are records of &quot;Germanicus&quot; being staged in 1673, five years before the original novel appeared. There are also marked differences between the theme and plot of the two works.
*&quot;Le Mercure galant&quot; or &quot;La Comédie sans titre&quot; (&quot;Play without a title&quot;) (1683). A theatrical comedy, and a comedy of manners. Monsieur de Boishuisant is an admirer of the eponymous periodical Mercure galant. Protagonist Oronte aspires to marry the daughter of the Monsieur and happens to be a friend of the editor. He gets permission to act as editor for a day to impress his prospective father-in-law. The play takes place in the offices of the periodical, and includes 13 vignettes where typical members of Parisian society present various requests to Oronte. Jean Donneau de Visé, the real-life founder of the periodical, attempted to stop production of the play. His efforts resulted in a change in title, though the play was not actually an attack on the periodical. Its depiction on stage serves as a testament to its popularity, and influence. Boursault reserves his satire for the well-born poetasters, who used their influence to get their works published alongside the better material of &quot;Le Mercure galant&quot;. The loosely connected scenes make this a work of social satire. There was little originality in the types depicted, which like a revue took its inspiration from contemporary figures and incidents. The people asking the support of the editor include an upwardly mobile bourgeois. He seeks to acquire a noble title, which would allow him to marry a young marquise. Another petitioner is a tax collector who has embezzled tax money, and wants the periodical to champion the cause of clearing his name. An old seaman wants to sell his life story to the periodical, certain that it will sell well among former veterans. He is a veteran of the Battle of Augusta (1676) and claims to be personally responsible for the death of enemy admiral Michiel de Ruyter. His actual claim to fame is that he provided the match which fired the cannon responsible for the deed.
*&quot;Marie Stuart&quot; (Mary Stuart, 1683). A tragedy. Based on the life of the ill-fated Mary, Queen of Scots. An unsuccessful work, though profitable for the writer. Boursault dedicated the work to François de Beauvilliers, 1st duc de Saint-Aignan. The Duc was sufficiently pleased to pay him a sum of 100 louis. This play was an entry to a long string of epic poems and dramas on the subject, mostly produced in France and Spain. Previous writers which had covered this popular subject were Antoine de Montchrestien (his version was written in 1596, and published in 1601), Tommaso Campanella (1598), Lope de Vega (1627), Charles Regnault (1639), Juan Bautista Diamante (1660), and Manuel de Gallegos (1660). Subsequent ones would include Vittorio Alfieri (1788), Friedrich Schiller (1800), and Gaetano Donizetti (1834).
*&quot;Les Fables d&#x27;Ésope, comédie&quot; or &quot;Ésope à la Ville&quot; (English: &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; or &quot;Aesop in the City&quot;, 1690). A moralistic play, where Aesop responds to any question and difficulty by reciting a relevant fable. The &quot;superhuman wisdom and virtue&quot; of the character were derided by later critics, who tended to find the traits wearisome. The initial production was not without its problems. The theatrical company which staged the play insisted on excluding a certain scene of the second act, while Boursault insisted on its inclusion. He only prevailed on the argument by convincing a valet de chambre to intervene on his behalf. On the opening performance, the initial audience reception was hostile. The play consisted of the main character narrating familiar tales, against their expectations. Jean Baptist Raisin, the lead actor, then interrupted the performance to explain why it was necessary. He explained that Aesop reciting his fables preserved the very essence of his character. His speech was met with applause and requests for the performance to continue. The play became a profitable hit. It was translated and revised for the English stage by John Vanbrugh, debuting under the title &quot;Aesop: a Comedy&quot; (January, 1697). Vanbrugh abandoned the stylish rhyming couplets of Boursault, revising them to a &quot;racier prose-with-songs&quot;. His Aesop was more naturalistic than his French counterpart, and spoke in a vernacular form of English. This version of Boursault&#x27;s work was regularly performed at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane to 1720. The work served at familiarizing Aesop to a wide English audience. Already in 1698, it inspired various pamphlets with titles such as &quot;Aesop at Epsom&quot;, &quot;Old Aesop at White-Hall&quot;, etc. In content they ranged from political commentary to scandal sheets.
*&quot;La Feste de la Seine&quot; (English: The feast of the Seine, 1690). A one-act divertissement, set to music.
*&quot;Phaeton&quot; (1691). A comedy. Based on Classical mythology, the main character is Phaëton, son of Helios/Sol (French:Soleil for Sun) and Clymene. The other featured characters include (1)Cephise (French for Cephissus), daughter of Merops, King of Egypt, (2) Clymene, mother of Phaëton and wife of Merops, (3) Epaphus, son of Zeus/Jupiter and Isis/Io, (4) Proteus, demigod and guardian to the herds of Poseidon/Neptune, (5)Theone, daughter of Proteus, (6)Nicaea, confidant to Theone, (7) Helios/Sol/La Soleil/The Sun, (8) Momus, (9) the first Hour of the day, (10) The Hour at which the Ladies go to the Temple, (11) a personified Moment, (12) Gaia/Terra (French:La Terre for Earth), (13) Zeus/Jupiter, and (14)the guards of Clymene. The main setting is Memphis.
*&quot;Fashionable Words&quot; (French: &quot;Les Mots à la mode&quot;, 1694). A comedy spoofing the fashion fads of the time and their associated terminology. Scenes are devoted to listing the many names for variants of the fontange hairstyle. The long list includes names such as &quot;bourgogne&quot; (Burgundy), &quot;jardiniere&quot; (gardener), &quot;souris&quot; (mouse), &quot;effrontée&quot; (shameless), and &quot;crève-cœur&quot; (heartbreaker).
*&quot;Meleager&quot; (French: Méléagre, 1694). A tragedy, unperformed. Based on the legendary hunt for the Calydonian Boar. The play takes place in Calydon, a city in Aetolia. The main characters are (1) Meleager, son of Oeneus and Althaea, and his lover (2) Atalanta, daughter of Iasus.
*&quot;Ésope à la Cour&quot; (English: &quot;Aesop at the Court, 1701&quot;). Sequel to the previous work, first performed shortly after the death of the writer. A number of characters and situations point to its social context at the dawn of the 18th-century. Croesus appoints Aesop as his Minister of State, and the newly appointed man delivers a speech condemning the vices of the royal court: dishonesty, hypocrisy, deception, flattery, love of gambling, and dissipation. The target is evidently not the court of Croesus, but that of Louis XIV. Another scene has Aesop debating religion with Iphicrates, a retired general who doubts the very existence of God. Iphicrates is a representative of freethought, though Aesop reminds him that free-thinkers still send for priests when at death&#x27;s door. Another target for criticism was relatively new for French comedy, &quot;M. Griffet&quot; the fermier (tax farmer). Jean de La Bruyère had already targeted these tax contractors at his works. But Boursault&#x27;s take on the subject serves as a precursor to &quot;Turcaret&quot; (1709) by Alain-René Lesage.

<doc id="838335" wikidata="Q279305" url="?curid=838335" title="Anthony Horowitz">
<text>Anthony John Horowitz (born 5 April 1955) is an English novelist and screenwriter specialising in mystery and suspense. His works for children and young adult readers include the &quot;Alex Rider&quot; series featuring a 14-year-old British boy who spies for MI6, &quot;The Power of Five&quot; series (known as &quot;The Gatekeepers&quot; in the US), and &quot;The Diamond Brothers&quot; series.

Horowitz&#x27;s works for adults include: the play &quot;Mindgame&quot; (2001); two Sherlock Holmes novels, &quot;The House of Silk&quot; (2011) and &quot;Moriarty&quot; (2014); two novels featuring his own detective Susan Ryeland, &quot;Magpie Murders&quot; (2016) and &quot;Moonflower Murders&quot; (2020); five novels featuring a fictionalised version of himself as a companion and chronicler to private investigator Daniel Hawthorne: &quot;The Word Is Murder&quot; (2017), &quot;The Sentence Is Death&quot; (2018), &quot;A Line to Kill&quot; (2021), &quot;The Twist of a Knife&quot; (2022), and &quot;Close to Death&quot; (2024).

The estate of James Bond creator Ian Fleming chose Horowitz to write Bond novels utilising unpublished material by Fleming, starting with &quot;Trigger Mortis&quot; in 2015, followed by &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; in 2018, and a third and final novel &quot;With a Mind to Kill&quot; in May 2022.

Horowitz has also written for television, contributing scripts to ITV&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; and adapting six early episodes of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; from the novels of Caroline Graham, including the first three episodes. He was the creator and writer of the ITV series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;Collision&quot; and &quot;Injustice&quot;, and the BBC series &quot;Crime Traveller&quot; and &quot;New Blood&quot;.

== Early life ==

Horowitz was born in Stanmore, Middlesex, into a Jewish family, and in his early years lived an upper middle class lifestyle. As a child, Horowitz used to go to Instow, where his nanny took him boating on the River Torridge. He also had a stuffed monkey named Benjamin (which was later eaten by his dog).

Horowitz attended Orley Farm School. He started writing at the age of eight or nine and he instantly knew he would be a professional writer. This was because he was an underachiever in school and was not physically fit, and found his escape in books and telling stories. In a 2006 interview, Horowitz stated &quot;I was quite certain, from my earliest memory, that I would be a professional writer and nothing but.&quot;

At age 13 he went to Rugby School, a public school, in Rugby, Warwickshire. He graduated from the University of York with a lower second class degree in English literature and art history in 1977, where he was in Vanbrugh College.

Horowitz&#x27;s mother introduced him to &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot;. She gave him a human skull for his 13th birthday. Horowitz said in an interview that it reminds him to get to the end of each story since he will soon look like the skull. 

Horowitz&#x27;s father was associated with some of the politicians in the &quot;circle&quot; of prime minister Harold Wilson, including Eric Miller. Facing bankruptcy, he moved his assets into Swiss numbered bank accounts. He died from cancer when Horowitz was 22, and the family was never able to track down the missing money despite years of trying. This left the family bankrupt, requiring the sale of the large family home.

==Literary career==

===Early literary work (1979–1991)===

Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Sinister Secret of Frederick K Bower&quot;, was a humorous adventure for children that was published in 1979 and later reissued as &quot;Enter Frederick K Bower&quot; in 1985. In 1981 his second novel, &quot;Misha, the Magician and the Mysterious Amulet&quot; was published and he moved to Paris to write his third book.

In 1983, the first novel in the Pentagram series was released. Entitled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Door-Bell&quot;, the story saw thirteen-year-old Martin Hopkins trying to adjust to a new life with a foster mother on a Yorkshire farm, but it quickly becomes a nightmare when he ends up having to battle an ancient evil that threatens the whole world. Only three of the four remaining novels in the series were ever released: &quot;The Night of the Scorpion&quot; (1984), &quot;The Silver Citadel&quot; (1986) and &quot;Day of the Dragon&quot; (1986).

In 1985, he released &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;, a collection of retold tales from around the world. He was also involved in writing scripts for the cult 1980s television series Robin of Sherwood and the spin-off novel.

In 1988, &quot;Groosham Grange&quot; was published. Its central character is a thirteen-year-old &quot;witch&quot;, David Eliot, gifted as the seventh son of a seventh son. This book went on to win the 1989 Lancashire Children&#x27;s Book of the Year Award. Some similarities have been noted between this book and J K Rowling&#x27;s later &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, but Horowitz did not choose to take action because of this.

The most important release of Horowitz&#x27;s early career was &quot;The Falcon&#x27;s Malteser&quot; (1986). This book was the first in the successful Diamond Brothers series, and was followed in 1987 by &quot;Public Enemy Number Two&quot;, and by &quot;South by South East&quot; in 1991.

=== Early children&#x27;s fiction success (1992–1999) ===

Horowitz wrote many stand-alone novels in the 1990s. His 1994 novel &quot;Granny,&quot; a comedy thriller about an evil grandmother, was Horowitz&#x27;s first book in three years, and it was the first of three books for an audience similar to that of &quot;Groosham Grange&quot;. The second of these was &quot;The Switch&quot;, a body swap story, first published in 1996. The third was 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Devil and His Boy&quot;, which is set in the Elizabethan era and explores the rumour of Elizabeth I&#x27;s secret son.

In 1999, &quot;The Unholy Grail&quot; was published as a sequel to &quot;Groosham Grange&quot;. It was later renamed &quot;Return to Groosham Grange&quot; in 2003, possibly to help young readers understand the connection between the two books. In 2021, Horowitz revealed to a fan on Twitter that he had plans to write a third book, but was dissuaded after the success of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series&quot;.&quot; In the same year, Horowitz publishing a collection of several short horror stories aimed for children and young adults, entitled &quot;Horowitz Horror&quot; (1999). This was an opportunity for Horowitz to further explore a darker side of his writing.

Some time before the new millennium, Horowitz attempted to reach out to an adult audience with a novel called &quot;Poisoned Pen.&quot; The novel is based around Martin Holland, who is a childhood friend of a 21st century incarnation of William Shakespeare. In the novel, William Shakespeare is reimagined as a Hollywood screenwriter who is murdered in a set of circumstances that Martin Holland finds rather odd, despite attempts from a Los Angeles detective to dissuade him. The novel follows Martin&#x27;s attempts to solve the ever-growing mystery through a series of rather unusual circumstances and a number of people who seem rather glad that Shakespeare was murdered. The novel has never been published in the UK or even in English, but copies in Spanish and Dutch have been released (retitled as &quot;El asesinato de Shakespeare&quot; and &quot;William S.&quot; respectively). As of June 2021, despite Horowitz&#x27;s recent successes in adult literature, there are no plans to get the novel republished.

=== Mainstream children&#x27;s fiction success (2000–2010) ===

Horowitz began his most famous and successful series in the new millennium with the &quot;Alex Rider&quot; novels. These books are about a 14-year-old boy becoming a spy, a member of the British Secret Service branch MI6. As of 2024, there are eleven books where Alex Rider is the protagonist, and another connected to the Alex Rider series: &quot;Stormbreaker&quot; (2000), &quot;Point Blanc&quot; (2001), &quot;Skeleton Key&quot; (2002), &quot;Eagle Strike&quot; (2003), &quot;Scorpia&quot; (2004) &quot;Ark Angel&quot; (2005), &quot;Snakehead&quot; (2007), &quot;Crocodile Tears&quot; (2009), &quot;Scorpia Rising&quot; (2011), plus &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; (2013). Horowitz had stated that &quot;Scorpia Rising&quot; was to be the last book in the Alex Rider series prior to writing &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; about the life of Yassen Gregorovich, but he has returned to the series with &quot;Never Say Die&quot; (2017), &quot;Nightshade&quot; (2020) and &quot;Nightshade Revenge&quot; (2023).

In 2003, Horowitz also wrote three novellas featuring the Diamond Brothers: The Blurred Man, &quot;The French Confection&quot; and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Wednesday&quot;, which were republished together as &quot;Three of Diamonds&quot; in 2004. The author information page in early editions of &quot;Scorpia&quot; and the introduction to &quot;Three of Diamonds&quot; claimed that Horowitz had travelled to Australia to research a new Diamond Brothers book, entitled &quot;Radius of the Lost Shark&quot;. This claim was further backed up when a new Diamond Brothers novella entitled &quot;The Greek who Stole Christmas!&quot; was released in 2007, where it is hinted at the end that &quot;Radius of the Lost Shark&quot; may turn out to be the eighth entry in the series. However, the next novel in the series was instead called &quot;Where Seagulls Dare&quot;, and is unrelated to the Australian-based adventure that was previously announced. Horowitz published the first six chapters unedited on his website throughout 2020, and the full, edited novel was published in 2022, with all profits going to support the NHS.

Horowitz also published two sequels to his short horror story collection; &quot;More Horowitz Horror&quot; (2000) and &quot;More Bloody Horowitz&quot; (2009). Many of the stories in &quot;Horowitz Horror&quot; and &quot;More Horowitz Horror&quot; were later repackaged in twos or threes as the &quot;Pocket Horowitz&quot; series, while &quot;More Bloody Horowitz&quot; was later reissued as &quot;Scared to Death&quot;. One of the short stories in &quot;More Bloody Horowitz&quot; is notable for serving as Horowitz&#x27;s opportunity to get even with fellow author Darren O&#x27;Shaughnessy, more commonly known as Darren Shan. In 2008, the pair had gotten into a joke dispute over O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s use of Horowitz&#x27;s name for an objectionable character (Antoine Horwitzer) in &quot;Wolf Island&quot;. In retaliation, Horowitz chose to plot a gruesome literary revenge in the short story &quot;The Man Who Killed Darren Shan.&quot;

In 2004, Horowitz again attempted to branch out to an adult audience with &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, a comedy about a man who tries to track a joke to its source with disastrous consequences. The book was not very successful, and in August 2005, Horowitz returned to young adult fiction by releasing a book called &quot;Raven&#x27;s Gate&quot; which began a second successful series entitled &quot;The Power of Five&quot; (&quot;The Gatekeepers&quot; in the United States). Based heavily on one of his earlier novels entitled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Door-Bell&quot;, each of the first four entries of &quot;The Power of Five&quot; subsequently ended up being a rewritten and expanded version of their respective counterpart from the &quot;Pentagram&quot; series. The second book in the series, &quot;Evil Star&quot; (based on &quot;The Night of the Scorpion&quot;)&quot;,&quot; was released in April 2006. The third in the series is called &quot;Nightrise&quot; (based on &quot;The Silver Citadel&quot;), and was released on 2 April 2007. The fourth book &quot;Necropolis&quot; (based on &quot;Day of the Dragon&quot;) was released in October 2008. The fifth and final book, the only one not based on an earlier &quot;Pentagram&quot; novel, was released in October 2012 and is called &quot;Oblivion&quot;. Horowitz describes this series as &quot;Alex Rider with devils and witches&quot;.

In October 2008, Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s play &quot;Mindgame&quot; opened Off Broadway at the SoHo Playhouse in New York City. &quot;Mindgame&quot; starred Keith Carradine, Lee Godart, and Kathleen McNenny. The production was the New York stage directorial debut for Ken Russell.

In March 2009 he was a guest on &quot;Private Passions&quot;, the biographical music discussion programme on BBC Radio 3.

===Continued success (2011–present)===

On 19 January 2011, the estate of Arthur Conan Doyle announced that Horowitz was to be the writer of a new Sherlock Holmes novel, the first such effort to receive an official endorsement from them and to be entitled &quot;The House of Silk&quot;. It was both published, in November of 2011 and broadcast on BBC Radio 4. A follow-up novel, &quot;Moriarty&quot;, was published in 2014.

In October 2014, the estate of Ian Fleming commissioned Horowitz to write a James Bond novel, &quot;Trigger Mortis&quot;, which was released in 2015. It was followed by a second novel, &quot;Forever&quot; &quot;and A Day&quot;, which came out on 31 May 2018. A third novel entitled &quot;With a Mind to Kill&quot; was released on 17 May 2022. Horowitz is the only author in recent years to have been invited by Ian Fleming Publications to write successive, official James Bond novels.

In 2016, Horowitz&#x27;s adult novel &quot;Magpie Murders&quot; was published. Having previously spoken about the book in 2005, it was initially described as being about &quot;a whodunit writer who is murdered while he&#x27;s writing his latest whodunit&quot;. Horowitz finally finished it in late 2015, and it was published in October 2016. A follow-up novel, &quot;Moonflower Murders&quot;, was released in 2020. A third and final novel in the series is expected to be released as well, with Horowitz expressing hope that he&#x27;ll start writing it sometime in 2023.

In 2017, Horowitz began a new series of detective novels which includes himself as a novelist enlisted by an out-of-work detective called Hawthorne to write books about the way Hawthorne solves crimes. The fictional Horowitz accompanies Hawthorne as he investigates murders committed in London and other locations. So far, starting with &quot;The Word is Murder&quot;, five of these books have appeared, with three others commissioned.

In 2011, Horowitz tweeted that he had plans to write a new trilogy for the same demographic as his &quot;Alex Rider&quot; and &quot;Power of Five&quot; books, but that it&#x27;s still &quot;a secret&quot;. During 2012 and 2013, Horowitz tweeted out some more information regarding the series, where he stated that it will be &quot;a completely new genre&quot; from anything else he&#x27;d done so far, and that it will have a contemporary setting in modern-day London with a 15-year-old protagonist. He also revealed that it&#x27;s tentatively entitled &quot;The Machine&quot;. However, Horowitz revealed in 2021 that he has yet to begin writing this series and that he has no immediate plans to do so.

==Film and television career==

=== Film ===
Horowitz wrote the screenplay for &quot;Just Ask for Diamond&quot;, a 1989 film adaptation of his &quot;Diamond Brothers&quot; novel &quot;The Falcon&#x27;s Malteser&quot; that had an all-star cast which included Bill Paterson, Jimmy Nail, Roy Kinnear, Susannah York, Michael Robbins and Patricia Hodge, and featured Colin Dale and Dursley McLinden as Nick and Tim Diamond respectively.

Horowitz is the writer of a feature film screenplay, &quot;The Gathering&quot;, which was released in 2003 and starred Christina Ricci.

He wrote the screenplay for Alex Rider&#x27;s first major motion picture, &quot;Stormbreaker&quot;.

=== Television ===
Horowitz began writing for television in the 1980s, contributing to the children&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Dramarama&quot;, and also writing five episodes of the third season for the popular fantasy series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;. He also novelised three of Carpenter&#x27;s episodes as a children&#x27;s book under the title &quot;Robin of Sherwood: The Hooded Man&quot; (1986).

In addition, he created &quot;Crossbow&quot; (1987), a half-hour action adventure series loosely based on William Tell. This era in Horowitz&#x27;s career also saw the release of &quot;Adventurer&quot; (1987), a thriller about a convict stuck on a prisoner ship with his sworn enemy based on the Richard Carpenter series, and &quot;Starting Out&quot; (1990), a collection of screenplays by the author himself, published.

His association with murder mysteries began with the adaptation of several Hercule Poirot stories for ITV&#x27;s popular &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; series during the 1990s. Often his work has a comic edge, such as with the comic murder anthology &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot; (BBC Two, 1991) and the comedy-drama &quot;The Last Englishman&quot; (1995), starring Jim Broadbent.

In 1991, &quot;The Diamond Brothers&quot;, a six-part television series written and directed by Horowitz himself, was broadcast on ITV. The series is based on the book &quot;South by South East&quot;, which Horowitz claimed he wrote after he had written the television series, effectively making &quot;South by South East&quot; a novelisation of the television series rather than the novel acting as the primary source of inspiration. Both McLinden and Dale reprised their respective film roles, which makes the television series act as a sequel to &quot;Just Ask for Diamond&quot;.

From 1997, he wrote the majority of the episodes in the early series of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. In 2001, he created a drama anthology series of his own for the BBC, &quot;Murder in Mind&quot;, an occasional series which deals with a different set of characters and a different murder every one-hour episode.

He also created two short-lived science-fiction shows, &quot;Crime Traveller&quot; (1997) for BBC One and &quot;The Vanishing Man&quot; (pilot 1996, series 1998) for ITV. While &quot;Crime Traveller&quot; received favourable viewing figures it was not renewed for a second season, which Horowitz accounts to temporary personnel transitioning within the BBC.

In 2002, Horowitz created the series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, a historically-themed detective series set during and after the Second World War. The series became the longest-running among Horowitz&#x27;s television projects, with a total of 28 episodes broadcast over eight series between 2002 and 2015.

Horowitz devised the 2009 ITV crime drama &quot;Collision&quot; and co-wrote the screenplay with Michael A. Walker.

Horowitz adapted his novel &quot;Magpie Murders&quot; into a television miniseries, which aired on BritBox and later BBC One in the UK and on the PBS series &quot;Masterpiece Mystery!&quot; in the US.

Filming commenced on the Canary Islands in the spring of 2024 on his television series &quot;Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue&quot;.

==Personal life==
Horowitz lives in Central London (Clerkenwell) with his wife Jill Green; they eloped to be married in Hong Kong on 15 April 1988. Green produced &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, the series Horowitz wrote for ITV, and other television shows he has written. They have two sons. 

Horowitz credits his family with much of his success in writing, as he says they help him with ideas and research. He is a patron of family support charity Home-Start in Suffolk and child protection charity Kidscape.

Politically, Horowitz has described himself to be &quot;vaguely conservative&quot;. Ahead of the 2010 United Kingdom general election, Horowitz stated he would vote for the Conservative Party in response to the policies of the governing Labour Party, but &quot;with little enthusiasm.&quot; In 2017, Horowitz expressed criticism of the notion of cultural appropriation after a publisher had allegedly tried to dissuade him from creating a black character as a central figure in one of his novels, and supported fellow author Lionel Shriver&#x27;s critiques on the same issue. He also criticised the social phenomenon of cancel culture and &quot;mobbing&quot; of figures for expressing diverse opinions, stating, &quot;There is a rigidity in the way we have begun to think and speak. If we step outside certain lines on certain issues, we find not just people disagreeing, but disagreeing to the extent of death threats. When somebody says something untoward in the press, and I am not saying this about myself, people don&#x27;t just say that was a stupid thing to say. They say, &quot;Lose your job.&quot; They want you to never ever have an income again.&quot;

==Honours and awards==

Horowitz was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours, both for services to literature. He won an Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Television Episode Teleplay from Episode 1 of Magpie Murders.

<text>KTVK (channel 3) is an independent television station in Phoenix, Arizona, United States. It is owned by Gray Media alongside CBS affiliate KPHO-TV (channel 5) and low-power station KPHE-LD (channel 44), a grouping known as &quot;Arizona&#x27;s Family&quot;. The three stations share studios on North Seventh Avenue in Uptown Phoenix; KTVK&#x27;s transmitter is located on South Mountain on the city&#x27;s south side. The station&#x27;s signal is relayed across northern Arizona on a network of translator stations.

KTVK signed on in 1955 as the fourth and last commercial VHF station in Phoenix. Owned by a syndicate fronted by former U.S. Senator and newly-elected Governor Ernest McFarland, it took over as Phoenix&#x27;s ABC affiliate. After spending its first three decades as an also-ran, it poached several employees from then-dominant KTSP-TV in 1985, beginning a surge that made it the market leader by 1990. It lost its ABC affiliation as part of a shuffle of networks in 1994 and 1995 but has since prospered as an independent. It was one of the last family-owned major-market TV stations, being owned in part or whole by the McFarland-Lewis family from its inception until 1999.

The Belo Corporation acquired KTVK in 1999 and also took over KASW (channel 61), which KTVK had been programming since it began broadcasting four years prior. After Belo merged with Gannett, owner of KPNX and &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, the station was briefly owned by former general manager Jack Sander but was sold to the Meredith Corporation, separating it from KASW and merging it with KPHO-TV. KPHO-TV moved into the newer, larger KTVK studios; the &quot;Arizona&#x27;s Family&quot; brand associated with channel 3 was extended to cover both stations, which began sharing news resources. In 2023, Gray Television&#x27;s Phoenix stations became the new television home of the Phoenix Suns of the NBA.

==History==
===Early years===
Channel 3 was the last commercial VHF allocation in Phoenix to be awarded. Prior to the 1948 freeze on new TV applications, there had been one application made, from radio station KTAR, one of the state&#x27;s largest. In February 1953, however, after the freeze was lifted, a second applicant filed for the channel: the Arizona Television Company. That put the plans of KTAR—which already had television equipment on order—on hold. Originally owned by Buckeye rancher and car dealer Ralph Watkins as well as two other principals, a new stockholder was added to the company in May: former senator Ernest McFarland, who bought a 40 percent interest. Also seeking channel 3 was Herb Askins, a local businessman, but his Desert Advertising Co. dropped out late in the year, setting up a high-stakes showdown between Phoenix&#x27;s NBC radio affiliate and the McFarland group in hearings in February 1954.

The staring contest, however, ended two months later. KTAR owner John J. Louis was unwilling to go through a hearing process to get a television sister for his radio station. Instead, in late April, he announced that KTAR would purchase Mesa-based NBC affiliate KTYL-TV channel 12, for $250,000, effectively awarding the channel 3 allocation to the Arizona Television Company. With no other applications to consider, a Federal Communications Commission hearing examiner recommended the company be granted a construction permit weeks later. The permit was duly granted on June 11.

The transmitter was built atop South Mountain, and a $500,000 studio building was constructed at 16th Street and Osborn Road. The station affiliated with ABC, filling a void that would have been created when existing ABC outlet KOOL-TV announced plans to change to CBS. By the time KTVK began broadcasting on February 28, 1955, McFarland had been elected Governor of Arizona. Channel 3 boasted the first color-equipped studios in Phoenix and the largest in the state.

Channel 3 lost money in its early years. Unlike its three competitors, it did not have a long-established radio sister on which to draw revenue. According to a 1990 interview, in the early 1960s, Walter Cronkite sought to buy a stake in the Arizona Television Company. He would have become KTVK&#x27;s main anchor, with a salary of $25,000 a year. However, Arizona Television Company could not afford to meet Cronkite&#x27;s salary demands.

McFarland bought out the remaining partners in the Arizona Television Company in 1977. Long before then, McFarland had intended for KTVK to be a locally-focused station. As Delbert Lewis, husband of McFarland&#x27;s adopted daughter, Jewell, put it in a 1978 interview with &quot;The Arizona Republic,&quot; his father-in-law wanted channel 3 to be &quot;a family corporation. All Arizonans. To keep it local.&quot; In an era when the television industry was already dominated by large station groups, Lewis said that his family took pride in the fact that major decisions were made in Phoenix, not in New York.

The socially laudatory aims of the McFarland-Lewis family initially did not translate into ratings success. Channel 3 spent most of its first 30 years stubbornly in third place. In January 1985, &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; television columnist Bud Wilkinson referred to the station as a &quot;blot on [ABC]&#x27;s affiliate ledger&quot; and claimed, citing a conversation with a top network executive, that the network had occasionally tried to move to another station and still was interested in the idea.

===The rise===
In March 1984, Delbert Lewis and Jewell McFarland Lewis were named the conservators of McFarland&#x27;s estate, just three months before the former governor and senator died. In the preceding decade, Delbert Lewis had taken the reins of the station; he was named president of the Arizona Television Company in 1975 and assumed the role of general manager in 1980. McFarland ceded day-to-day control of the station to his relatives after undergoing brain surgery in 1977, shortly after buying out his partners. Upon McFarland&#x27;s death, the Lewises inherited full control of KTVK. Eventually, Jewell and Delbert held a 60 percent controlling interest in the Arizona Television Company, with the remaining 40 percent divided between their four children. In 1986, Lewis made the most consequential hires in channel 3&#x27;s history when he poached a dozen employees from long-dominant KTSP-TV. Included in the raid were KTSP&#x27;s news director, Bill Miller, and his assistant news director, Phil Alvidrez. Miller became KTVK&#x27;s station manager, while Alvidrez became KTVK&#x27;s news director.

Under Miller and Alvidrez, the station relaunched its news department as &quot;NewsChannel 3&quot; and began a climb to the top of the ratings. The station dismissed its existing weeknight news anchor team and rolled out a new lineup, led by new hire Cameron Harper and former weekend anchor Heidi Foglesong. Lewis bankrolled major investments in people, syndicated programming and equipment and dramatically boosted KTVK&#x27;s promotional budget. He had no qualms about spending what he believed it would take to increase KTVK&#x27;s profile; in 1990, he told &quot;The Republic&quot; that if Miller and others showed that they needed something, he would ensure that they would get it. As a &quot;one-man board of directors&quot;, he was able to make decisions in mere minutes that took years at KTVK&#x27;s corporate-owned competitors. For example, when Miller sought a new $500,000 satellite truck, Lewis greenlighted it in only 15 minutes. Improvement started slowly but was noticeable by 1988. Even those changes almost came too slowly for ABC; as late as 1989, ABC executives were in negotiations to move from KTVK to KTSP-TV.

The changes finally began to pay off by the November 1990 sweeps period. KTVK&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast surged to first place, and its early evening newscasts were posting the strongest numbers in their history. Channel 3 also was the most-watched station in the Valley in prime time, even as NBC won its 11th consecutive sweeps period nationally. A year later, it tied KTSP-TV in the early evening timeslot and took the lead in the morning. By February 1992, channel 3 had pulled ahead of channel 10 at 6 pm; it was the first time on record that channel 10 had lost that timeslot.

The growth of the company fueled additional media acquisitions. In the span of a year, the Arizona Television Company bought &quot;Phoenix Magazine&quot; and radio station KESZ (99.9 FM), as well as a production studio. Reorganizing as Media America Corp. (and later MAC America Communications), the group also handled programming responsibilities for the new KTWC (103.5 FM) when it signed on in 1994.

===Going independent===

On May 23, 1994, New World Communications and Fox announced a pact that would see KSAZ-TV leave its longtime affiliation with CBS to join Fox. The landmark deal also left CBS looking for new affiliates in several other markets, including Detroit, Cleveland, and Tampa, and set off a mad dash to secure network affiliations. KTVK was at a distinct disadvantage in the ensuing affiliate shuffle even though it was now one of the strongest ABC affiliates in the country. By this time, it had firmly established itself as the Valley&#x27;s news leader, and its overall ratings were 20 points ahead of the runner-up. However, even though channel 3 had left its ratings-challenged past far behind, its gains over the previous decade meant little in the affiliate shuffle. It took place in an environment which favored station groups with presences in multiple cities, not KTVK—by this time, one of the last family-owned major-market stations in the country.

In this environment, Scripps-Howard Broadcasting, owner of displaced Fox affiliate KNXV-TV, found itself in a strong position. Scripps owned two powerful bargaining chips in its successful and longstanding ABC affiliates in Detroit and in Cleveland. Both stations were being heavily pursued by CBS, which was about to lose its longstanding New World-owned affiliates to Fox. KTVK was already in talks for a new affiliation agreement with ABC that would have more than doubled its hourly compensation rate, but it would still have been less than the network was offering to stations in markets much smaller than Phoenix. However, ABC pulled the offer off the table on the advice of its lawyers; a call with ABC network president Bob Iger revealed that Scripps-Howard—a longtime partner of the network—had threatened to flip its Detroit and Cleveland ABC affiliates to CBS unless ABC moved its Phoenix affiliation to KNXV-TV. Iger wanted to keep KTVK, but Tom Murphy, the CEO of Capital Cities/ABC, felt that he had to be able to offer the ABC affiliation in Phoenix to Scripps if necessary to avoid potential long-term damage to the ABC television network. Specifically, ABC officials feared losing as much as half a ratings point on &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; if Scripps made good on its threat to flip its Detroit and Cleveland stations to CBS.

Scripps-Howard would not relent from demanding the ABC affiliation for Phoenix and even refused $25 million from the network to &quot;take Phoenix off the table&quot;. Ultimately, ABC gave in and awarded its affiliations in Phoenix, Tampa, and Baltimore to Scripps; in informing KTVK, Iger explained that they &quot;had to&quot; do so. The Lewises then sought to affiliate with CBS, which was about to be displaced from KSAZ. However, despite Tom Murphy&#x27;s support and channel 3&#x27;s stronger ratings, CBS ultimately chose a deal with group owner Meredith Corporation and its KPHO-TV. Meredith also provided CBS security in Kansas City, where the New World switches had dislodged the NBC affiliation, and an upgrade in the Flint, Michigan, market. Miller told &quot;The Republic&quot; that CBS gave its Phoenix affiliation to KPHO rather than face having to search for a new affiliate in Kansas City, though CBS officials denied this. According to Miller, KTVK would have been the obvious choice to take the CBS affiliation if CBS only had to consider &quot;which two stations it wanted in Phoenix&quot;.

Over the second half of 1994, KTVK relinquished ABC programming to KNXV in stages. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; was the first ABC program to move to KNXV after KTVK displaced it with a new local morning newscast. KNXV then picked up &quot;World News Tonight&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot; on December 12, the day after Fox programming moved to KSAZ. KTVK&#x27;s nearly 40-year affiliation with ABC officially ended on January 9, 1995, when ABC&#x27;s remaining non-news programming moved to KNXV.

Despite the loss of ABC programming, the Lewises and station management committed to build KTVK into one of the nation&#x27;s top independents. The station spent some $100 million on new syndicated programming, including &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;, as well as poaching the most popular shows in syndication at the time from KSAZ-TV—game shows &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;—and programming them in the prime time hour between 7 and 8 pm. KTVK also broke ground on a new studio center to house its growing operations. The news department was expanded with 20 new staffers. Media America struck a local marketing agreement to operate the new KASW (channel 61) with The WB—which would air on KTVK until KASW launched in September 1995—and children&#x27;s programming, and it launched the AZ News Channel, a cable offering on Cox Communications systems featuring breaking news and replays of KTVK newscasts that had been in the planning stages since 1993. Another large acquisition came in the form of sports rights to the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, with channel 3 airing half of the team&#x27;s games beginning in the 1998 season. The station remained Phoenix&#x27;s news leader in most time slots, with the exception of 10 pm, when strong NBC programming gave KPNX the lead.

In the fall of 1998, KTVK briefly aired &quot;The Howard Stern Radio Show&quot;; both KTVK (which aired the program after its 10 p.m. news) and Lubbock, Texas, Fox affiliate KJTV-TV pulled the program from their schedules after two episodes.

===Belo ownership===

In what Del Lewis described as &quot;the most difficult decision our family has ever made&quot;, MAC America sold KTVK and its other remaining assets to the Belo Corporation of Dallas, Texas, for $315 million in July 1999–a handsome return on McFarland&#x27;s investment 44 years earlier. The Lewises cited the costs of conversion to digital television, economies of scale that station groups had in purchasing syndicated programming, and competition from cable and satellite TV in their decision to sell; the transaction capped two years of selling the rest of the company, including &quot;Phoenix Magazine&quot;, the production facility, and the radio stations, which had suffered from the needed investments in programming and news expansion at KTVK. Later that year, Belo announced that it would purchase KASW from Gregory Brooks, forming the first television duopoly in the Phoenix market just as they were being legalized. Bill Miller retired a year later.

In 2000, Belo and Cox expanded their existing partnership with a new Spanish-language channel, ¡Más! Arizona, that launched on October 16 of that year. KTVK lost the Diamondbacks after the 2007 season, when the team opted to move all of its regional telecasts to cable on regional sports network Fox Sports Arizona (now Bally Sports Arizona).

===Helicopter crash===
On July 27, 2007, KTVK&#x27;s news helicopter &quot;News Chopper 3&quot; was involved in a mid-air collision when another news helicopter, belonging to KNXV-TV, struck it from behind. The collision occurred above Steele Indian School Park (near Third Street and Indian School Road), while both aircraft were covering a police pursuit in downtown Phoenix. All four people aboard both helicopters were killed, including KTVK pilot Scott Bowerbank and photographer Jim Cox. An investigation conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the accident was caused by both pilots&#x27; inability to see one another and avoid a collision with the other helicopter.

The helicopter collision resulted in the establishment of shared news helicopters in the Phoenix market; while KTVK initially shared a helicopter with KPHO-TV and KPNX, all four Phoenix news operations now share a single helicopter.

===Sale to Meredith===
On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company, the owner of KPNX and the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;, acquired Belo. As FCC rules restrict one company from owning more than two television stations in the same market, Gannett announced that it would spin off KTVK and KASW to Sander Media, LLC, a company operated by former Belo executive Jack Sander. While Gannett intended to provide services to the stations through a shared services agreement, KTVK and KASW&#x27;s operations would have remained largely separate from KPNX and the &quot;Republic&quot;. Despite objections to the Gannett-Belo merger by anti-consolidation groups (such as Free Press) and pay television providers (due to ownership conflicts involving television stations and newspapers both companies owned in other markets, the use of Sander as a third-party licensee to buy stations that would be operated by the owner of a same-market competitor, concerns over any future operational consolidation of the stations involved in the deal, and the Gannett and Sander stations colluding in retransmission consent negotiations), the FCC granted approval of the deal on December 20.

As the sale was completed on December 23, 2013, Sander/Gannett then sold KTVK to the Meredith Corporation, owner of CBS affiliate KPHO-TV. The license assets of KASW were sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting, with Meredith to operate that station through a shared services agreement. However, as a voluntary condition of the transaction&#x27;s approval, that station was instead sold off to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group. The sale was approved on June 16, 2014, and completed on June 19. On August 7, 2014, Meredith bought the KTVK studios, with the intent of housing the combined operation at KTVK&#x27;s larger and newer facility.

The union of KTVK and KPHO-TV&#x27;s news operations, marketed under the &quot;Arizona&#x27;s Family&quot; banner long associated with KTVK, came with the loss of 14 jobs across both stations. KPHO general manager Ed Munson headed the combined operation until his 2018 retirement.

===Sale to Gray Television===
On May 3, 2021, Gray Television announced its intent to purchase the Meredith Local Media division, including KTVK and KPHO, for $2.7 billion. These would be Gray&#x27;s second and third stations in Arizona, having already bought KOLD-TV in Tucson. The sale was completed on December 1.

===Newscasts===
From the beginning, KTVK placed a high premium on news. The McFarlands and Lewises saw themselves mostly as &quot;newspeople, not TV people&quot;. Despite this, for most of its history, KTVK had been the third-rated local station for news and had &quot;long been viewed as a loser&quot; and &quot;a joke&quot; in the industry; the news programs had stints as &quot;Total News&quot; and later &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;. While the station briefly had momentum under news director Cecil Tuck in the early 1980s, it was unable to escape the ratings basement. The station frequently attempted to lure personalities from competing stations, with mixed results: Mary Jo West, the first female anchor in Phoenix at KOOL/KTSP, returned from a job at CBS News in 1983, but channel 3 was unsuccessful in hiring anchors from KPNX. West left in the summer of 1986.

The station managed to shed its third-place positioning and become the market leader after the hiring of Miller and Alvidrez in 1986. However, the loss of ABC affiliation led to major changes for KTVK&#x27;s news department. Chief among them was the launch of a three-hour morning newscast, &quot;Good Morning Arizona&quot;; the program was initially hosted by Jodi Applegate, who would leave KTVK to host the weekend editions of &quot;The Today Show&quot; in 1996. By that time, &quot;Good Morning Arizona&quot; had beaten out all of its local and national competitors in the ratings. The station also transformed its 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts into the 90-minute &quot;Good Evening Arizona&quot;, and when KASW launched in 1995, KTVK produced a 9 p.m. newscast for the new station.

KTVK itself, however, was later to debut prime time news than many independent stations. In 1996, it instead relaunched its 10 p.m. newscast as &quot;Tonight Arizona&quot;, which later became &quot;NewShow&quot; and &quot;The News Show&quot;. This changed in 2008, when the station replaced 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. broadcasts with a 9 p.m. newscast and expanded &quot;Good Morning Arizona&quot;, bringing it to 52 hours a week of newscasts; a 10 p.m. broadcast was later reinstated in 2011.

KTVK was also involved with news production and simulcasts for the Tucson market when Belo owned and operated KMSB, Tucson&#x27;s Fox affiliate. In 2003, KMSB began a 9 p.m. newscast, which originally was produced in Phoenix and used news reporting from KMSB-employed reporters and from Tucson NBC affiliate KVOA. Additionally, from 2003 to 2012, KMSB simulcast &quot;Good Morning Arizona&quot;.

===Sports===
Gray announced in January 2023 that it would launch the Arizona&#x27;s Family Sports and Entertainment Network (AZFSEN) over KPHE-LD on March 1, 2023, and that it had acquired the rights to Phoenix Rising FC soccer; KPHE will air all 34 matches, with five simulcasts on KTVK and one on KPHO-TV.

On April 28, 2023, Gray announced that the rights to the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury would move from Bally Sports Arizona to KTVK and KPHE-LD beginning with the 2023 Phoenix Mercury season and 2023–24 Phoenix Suns season. The two stations together will carry all non-nationally televised games, with KTVK to carry at least 40 Suns games per season and 13 Mercury games per season; the contract also includes provision for a streaming platform known as Kiswe to carry Suns and Mercury games. The parent company of Bally Sports Arizona, Diamond Sports Group, responded by claiming that the Suns/Mercury deal represented a breach of contract by not allowing Diamond to exercise its contractual rights in violation of bankruptcy law. The CEO of the Phoenix Suns and Mercury, Josh Bartelstein, had previously cited a &quot;goal of wide distribution&quot; for the teams in the face of cord cutting affecting the availability of RSNs. While a bankruptcy judge blocked the Suns portion of the deal, the Mercury portion was allowed to proceed. On July 14, the Suns announced that the Gray deal would go ahead, as Diamond Sports Group declined to match the contract.

===Non-news programming===
KTVK also airs a limited amount of non-news local programming. One of the station&#x27;s offerings, the local pet adoption encouragement program &quot;Pets on Parade&quot; with the Arizona Humane Society, is the longest-running local TV show in Arizona, having first been broadcast in December 1958. In 2010, the station launched the weekly political program &quot;Politics Unplugged&quot;.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

On October 20, 2009, KTVK added This TV to its 3.2 digital subchannel. This TV was dropped on April 13, 2015, and replaced with a 24/7 loop of local news—the former Arizona NewsChannel. On the same day, sister station KPHO&#x27;s former 24/7 weather service, moved to KTVK&#x27;s 3.3 digital subchannel. It was dropped from KPHO in favor of Cozi TV. On August 1, 2017, the local news loop on 3.2 was replaced by the sci-fi network Comet.

KTVK joined the Phoenix ATSC 3.0 lineup on July 8, 2021, on the KFPH-CD multiplex. On that date, as part of rebalancing of its subchannels, the KASW subchannel of Ion Mystery was moved to the KTVK multiplex.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KTVK ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 24, using virtual channel 3.

As part of the SAFER Act, KTVK kept its analog signal on the air to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters. KTVK&#x27;s &quot;nightlight&quot; service was originally intended to last 30 days but was instead discontinued two weeks after the analog-to-digital transition, on June 26.

===Translators===
KTVK is rebroadcast on the following translator stations:
* Bullhead City (Katherine Landing): K12OF-D
* Bullhead City (Oatman–Goldroad Crest): K16EV-D

<text>Claude Gillot (April 27, 1673 – May 4, 1722) was a French painter, printmaker, and illustrator, best known as the master of Watteau and Lancret.

==Life==
Gillot was born in Langres. He was a painter, engraver, book illustrator, metal worker, and designer for the theater. He had Watteau as an apprentice between 1703 and 1708.

Gillot&#x27;s sportive mythological landscape pieces, with such titles as &quot;Feast of Pan&quot; and &quot;Feast of Bacchus&quot;, opened the Academy of Painting at Paris to him in 1715; and he then adapted his art to the fashionable tastes of the day, and introduced the decorative &quot;fêtes champêtres&quot;, in which he was afterwards surpassed by his pupils, though Gillot&#x27;s examples usually lack the contemporary dress of Watteau&#x27;s. His paintings often include characters from the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, a taste he passed on to Watteau. Gillot was also closely connected with the opera and theatre as a designer of scenery and costumes. He died in Paris, aged 49.

<text>Nainsook is a soft, fine, lightweight form of muslin. Muslin encompasses a broad range of fabrics of varying weight and fineness, but is always a plain weave, cotton fabric. The word &#x27;nainsook&#x27; is first documented in 1790, and derives from the Hindi word &quot;nainsukh&quot;, which literally means &quot;eye&#x27;s delight&quot;.

Nainsook was often used to make babies&#x27; clothing or lingerie at least until the 1920s. Nainsook cotton was also often used to make bias tape in the 1950s and 1960s.

He competed at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics in the 5000 m event and won it in 1948, defeating Emil Zátopek in the final and becoming the first Belgian track and field athlete to win an Olympic title. He lost to Zátopek at the 1950 European Championships, placing third.

Reiff competed in boxing and football before changing to athletics.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Jouvenet (; 1 May 1644 – 5 April 1717) was a French painter, especially of religious subjects.

==Biography==
He was born into an artistic family in Rouen. His first training in art was from his father, Laurent Jouvenet; a generation earlier, his grandfather, Noel Jouvenet, may have taught Nicolas Poussin.

Jouvenet early showed a remarkable aptitude for his profession, and on arriving in Paris, attracted the attention of Le Brun, by whom he was employed at Versailles, notably in the &quot;Salon de Mars&quot; (1671–74), and under whose auspices, in 1675, he became a member of the &quot;Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture&quot;, of which he was elected professor in 1681, and one of the four perpetual rectors in 1707. He also worked under Charles de La Fosse in the Invalides and Trianon. Jouvenet was later Director of the Académie from 1705 to 1708.

The great mass of works that he executed, chiefly in Paris, many of which, including his celebrated &quot;Miraculous Draught of Fishes&quot; (engraved by Jean Audran) are now in the Louvre, show his fertility in invention and execution, and also that he possessed in a high degree that general dignity of arrangement and style which distinguished the school of Le Brun. Anthony Blunt found in Jouvenet&#x27;s manner reminiscences of Poussin, Le Sueur, and the late work of Raphael, but with a characteristic Baroque emotionalism that &quot;is still far from the full Baroque ... His compositions are primarily planned as high reliefs, and the movements are in sharp diagonal straight lines rather than in curves.&quot; The naturalism of Jouvenet&#x27;s style sets his work apart from most of the religious paintings of his time.

Jouvenet died on 5 April 1717, having been forced by paralysis during the last four years of his life to work with his left hand.

<doc id="838353" wikidata="Q7886628" url="?curid=838353" title="Union of Jewish Students">
<text>The Union of Jewish Students of the United Kingdom and Ireland (UJS) represents Jewish students in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is a member of the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS) and the European Union of Jewish Students (EUJS) and an associate member of the National Union of Students, and is represented on the Board of Deputies of British Jews. 

==History==
===Launch===
The IUJF (Inter University Jewish Federation) was the creation in 1919 of the Manchester Jewish Association. They saw a growing pride in the Jewish Community and believed it was appropriate for Jewish students to have a national organisation to co-ordinate the activities of Jewish student Societies and represent Jewish students at a national level.

The first step was a conference in Manchester on 17 July 1919 at which four Jewish societies were represented: Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, and Oxford. Although not represented initially, the London University Jewish Society subsequently took an active and eventually a leading role.

===Early years===
With the rise to power in Germany of the Nazi Party, many Jewish students had their studies disrupted and sought refuge in non-occupied Europe and elsewhere; the International Students Service was in the forefront of providing advice to these displaced students and financial assistance was made available from communal funds. The Federation was active in supporting these efforts; almost £2,000 was raised from University students in Britain.

By 1946, the following Universities had societies affiliated to the Federation, in addition to those already mentioned: Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, University College, Cardiff, Dublin, Durham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Reading, and Sheffield.

The two main activities of the Federation, from its inception, were an annual Summer School and an Annual Conference, held in the winter vacation.

Throughout its existence, the IUJF was involved with the Jewish community. It was represented on the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Zionist Federation and had an ongoing liaison with Jewish Youth Study Groups.

For the almost fifty years from its foundation until the creation of the Hillel Foundation, the IUJF had no office, no staff, no sabbatical officers and no assured budget other than money that students could raise themselves. The Federation was run from the rooms of the then Chairman or Secretary; all activities were organized by the students themselves on a voluntary basis; from time to time, small subventions were obtained from the general community.

===Expansion===
The partnership with which B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith set up the Hillel Foundation provided the IUJF with its first permanent office and its first professional assistance. This enabled the Federation and its successor, UJS, to increase its work.

The organization was renamed the Union of Jewish Students in 1973.

==Activities and values==
As of 2021, UJS represents approximately 8,500 students, with 4,000–4,500 being members of its 69 affiliated Jewish Societies (J-Socs) on individual campuses. Expenditure in 2020/21 was under £1m. It states that its core values are: cross-communalism, peer-leadership, representation and engagement with Israel. Its communal partners and supporters include the Jewish Leadership Council, UJIA and the Community Security Trust.

It provides training and funding for individual J-Socs; campaigns on specific issues; offers members the opportunity to participate in networking events, master classes and a summer placement scheme; runs national events to bring together Jewish students, including the JUEFA Cup football tournament, the UJS training Summit, the UJS Conference, the UJS Student Awards, Shabbat UK and Jewniversity Challenge, and; works with universities to secure Jewish student accommodation and spaces for J-Soc activities as well as sourcing kosher food and students&#x27; other religious needs. It also organises a range of trips to Israel.

It has been active within the National Union of Students, including its Anti-Racism and Anti-Fascism campaigns. It has supported the campaigns of Wes Streeting, Aaron Porter, and Shakira Martin for the role of NUS President in 2008, 2010, and 2017, respectively.

<doc id="838355" wikidata="Q917004" url="?curid=838355" title="Charlie Higson">
<text>Charles Murray Higson (born 3 July 1958) is an English actor, comedian, author and former singer. He has also written and produced for television and is the author of the young adult post-apocalyptic book series &quot;The Enemy&quot;, as well as the first five novels in the &quot;Young Bond&quot; series.

== Early life ==
Born in Frome, Somerset, Higson was educated at Sevenoaks School, Kent and at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich (where his brother taught from 1986 to 2008, latterly as Professor of Film Studies). At UEA, Higson met Paul Whitehouse, David Cummings and Terry Edwards. Higson, Cummings and Edwards formed the band The Higsons, of which Higson was the lead singer from 1980 to 1986. They released two singles on the Specials&#x27; 2 Tone Records label. This was after he had formed the punk band The Right Hand Lovers, wherein he performed as &quot;Switch&quot;. Higson then started squatting in London and became a decorator, coincidentally decorating the house of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie.

== Career ==
Higson started writing for Harry Enfield with Paul Whitehouse and performing comedy. He came to public attention as one of the main writers and performers of the BBC Two sketch show &quot;The Fast Show&quot; (1994–2000). He also worked with Whitehouse on the radio comedy &quot;Down the Line&quot;. In 1994 Higson co-wrote the screenplay for the thriller film &quot;Suite 16&quot; with Lise Mayer.

He worked as producer, writer, director and occasional guest star on &quot;Randall &amp; Hopkirk&quot; from 2000 to 2001. Subsequent television work has included writing and starring in BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;Fast Show&quot; spin-off sitcom &quot;Swiss Toni&quot;. He first appeared as a panellist on &quot;QI&quot; in 2007. In 2010 he co-directed and starred in the series &quot;Bellamy&#x27;s People&quot;.

In 2013 Higson adapted Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;A Caribbean Mystery&quot; for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; series. In 2015 Higson reimagined the novel &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson for ITV Studios into a ten part adventure series, set in the 1930s titled &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot;. In 2017, Higson appeared as Ian Winterman in series three of &quot;Broadchurch&quot; and as Ronnie Maguire in series three of &quot;Grantchester&quot;.

2020 saw Higson compete on &quot;Richard Osman&#x27;s House of Games&quot;. alongside Chizzy Akudolu, Kate Williams and Tom Allen.

Higson has also starred in &quot;Lobby Land&quot;, a radio sitcom on BBC Radio 4, as Tom Shriver MP.

=== Books ===
&quot;Time Out&quot; has described Higson as &quot;The missing link between Dick Emery and Bret Easton Ellis&quot;.

Higson wrote a series of five &quot;Young Bond&quot; novels, aimed at younger readers and concentrating on James Bond&#x27;s school-days at Eton starting with &quot;SilverFin&quot;, released in 2005, and ending with &quot;By Royal Command&quot; (2008). Higson had been at school with Jonathan Evans, former Director General of MI5.

Higson wrote a post-apocalyptic, zombie-horror series of books for young adults. The eponymous first book in the series, titled &quot;The Enemy&quot;, was released in 2009.
At a school event at Abingdon School on 14 September 2011, Charlie told children: &quot;Originally it was going to be three books and then my publisher, Puffin, said make it five, and now we&#x27;re up to it being seven.&quot; The seventh novel, &quot;The End&quot;, was published in 2015.

In 2018 Higson wrote a &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebook titled The Gates of Death, which was published by Scholastic books as part of their campaign to relaunch the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; franchise. He is a long term &quot;FF&quot; enthusiast, having attended Fighting Fantasy Fest 2 in London the previous year and also made a cameo appearance in the Ian Livingstone gamebook &quot;Blood of the Zombies&quot;.

In May 2023 Higson released his first adult Bond novel, &quot;On His Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, to mark the Coronation of King Charles III and support the National Literacy Trust.

== Personal life ==
Higson lives in London with his wife and three sons.

<doc id="838359" wikidata="Q662463" url="?curid=838359" title="Bolt Thrower">
<text>Bolt Thrower were a British death metal band from Coventry. They formed in 1986 and released their first album with Vinyl Solution in 1988. The band then shifted to a new record label, Earache Records, soon becoming one of the best selling bands on that label. Their last label was Metal Blade Records. The band had a succession of members, and had toured Europe, the United States, and Australia. Over the course of their 30-year career, Bolt Thrower released eight studio albums, three EPs, one live album, three compilation albums and two demos. Their albums have sold over 100,000 copies in the United States as of 2005. 

Following the release of their eighth album &quot;Those Once Loyal&quot; (2005), Bolt Thrower announced an indefinite hiatus from recording albums in June 2008, although they would continue to tour until the death of drummer Martin Kearns on 14 September 2015 and their subsequent disbandment in 2016, on the first anniversary of his death.

==History==
===Early history (1986–1988)===
Bolt Thrower was formed in September 1986, influenced largely by bands such as Slayer, Crass and Discharge. The band was founded by bassist Gavin Ward and guitarist Barry Thomson in a Coventry pub toilet during a hardcore punk gig. Shortly thereafter Andrew Whale and Alan West joined on drums and vocals respectively. In April 1987 the &quot;In Battle There Is No Law&quot; demo was recorded with this line-up.

Their second recording was the &quot;Concession of Pain&quot; demo, which they made in September 1987. Gavin had switched to guitars and they recruited Alex Tweedy to play the bass. However, Alex did not show up for the recording, and so Gavin played both guitar and bass for the demo. Two weeks after the recording session, Gavin&#x27;s girlfriend Jo Bench replaced Tweedy.

With this line-up they recorded their first Peel session on 3 January 1988, with John Peel, the alternative disk jockey of BBC Radio One. He had received their second demo and became enthusiastic about the band. They recorded four tracks for it, resulting in a deal with Vinyl Solution to release one album. Just before the recording of their first full-length album, they replaced their singer with their driver Karl Willetts. Their debut LP, &quot;In Battle There Is No Law&quot; is only a half hour in length and reflects their early crust punk and grindcore influences.

===Rise to popularity and departures of Karl Willetts and Andy Whale (1989–1994)===

They were not satisfied with the deal with Vinyl Solution as it was a pure hardcore label at that time. The label did little promotion for Bolt Thrower, and their blend of death metal and hardcore punk was unorthodox at the time, so after one album Bolt Thrower decided to leave Vinyl Solution and were subsequently signed up with Earache Records. Earache Records had also signed many other death metal bands including Carcass and Napalm Death. The artwork for their second album was created by John Sibbick under contract for Games Workshop for the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook released in 1987. After Games Workshop heard the recording of the songs for Bolt Thrower&#x27;s second Peel session, which was recorded on 6 November 1988, they offered to supply the artwork for Bolt Thrower&#x27;s album, an offer the band quickly accepted. The record was released in 1989, titled &quot;Realm of Chaos: Slaves to Darkness&quot;, after the 1988 book of the same name published by Games Workshop. Most of the lyrics to the songs were also influenced by the game, but not merely because of the deal with Games Workshop. Karl, Andy and Gavin were very much into the Games Workshop role playing game, Warhammer 40,000. The band even wrote a couple of songs about these games, including &quot;Plague Bearer&quot; and &quot;World Eater&quot;. After the recording of &quot;Realm of Chaos&quot;, they went on the &#x27;Grindcrusher Tour&#x27; with labelmates Napalm Death, Carcass and Morbid Angel. On the &quot;Cenotaph&quot; EP one song (&quot;Realm of Chaos&quot;) appears that is recorded during this tour. This EP also features two CD-bonus tracks from &quot;War Master&quot;, &quot;Realm of Chaos&quot; plus the song &quot;Cenotaph&quot;.

Continuing, they recorded their third and final Peel session on 22 July 1990. These three songs from the upcoming album were performed in raw versions, as well as &quot;Lost Souls Domain&quot; from &quot;Realm of Chaos&quot;. The next step in the history of Bolt Thrower was the album titled &quot;War Master&quot;. It was recorded, as was the previous album, in Slaughterhouse Studios, which burnt down two weeks after the recordings were completed. Again, Games Workshop offered to do their artwork; however, as it was considered too expensive, Bolt Thrower declined the offer. The former head designer of Games Workshop would do the artwork, resulting in artwork quite similar to &quot;Realm of Chaos&quot;. During the US tour they went on to promote the &quot;War Master&quot; album, they used an old US school bus as a tour bus, loaded with many computer games. All three Peel sessions were then released on one CD named &quot;The Peel Sessions 1988–90&quot; in 1991.

Their next step was the album &quot;The IVth Crusade&quot;. The title has a double meaning, as it was their fourth studio album (not counting the Peel sessions), but the album title also refers to the Fourth Crusade and the capturing of Constantinople. The cover artwork is a painting from Eugène Delacroix, showing &quot;The Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople&quot;.

They wrote slower songs which were heavier and more bombastic. It leans more towards doom metal influenced by bands like Candlemass, in combination with their own massive death metal sound. The album was followed by the tour &#x27;World Crusade&#x27; with the Polish death metal act Vader and the Swedish death metal band Grave in Europe. The band toured the US again as well as Australia. During this time, a single was released called &quot;Spearhead&quot;, containing a very heavy, extended remix of the CD track &quot;Spearhead&quot;, plus two new tracks and &quot;Dying Creed&quot; off the new album.

Their next album is called &quot;...For Victory&quot; and was released in 1994. It was the final album with Karl Willetts and Andrew Whale. Both left the band because of changing life directions. The latest American tour did not go well, they returned home prematurely and by this time the band was quite fed-up with touring. A limited edition of the album exists containing a bonus live CD, called &quot;War&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Live War&quot;). After the album released, Karl Willetts was replaced by former Pestilence singer Martin van Drunen, and Martin &quot;Kiddie&quot; Kearns, who took over the drum kit.

===More lineup changes, &quot;Mercenary&quot; and &quot;Honour – Valour – Pride&quot; (1995–2003)===
In 1995 and 1996 they went on two European tours. In 1997, Martin van Drunen decided to leave the band as he felt that he never really became a part of Bolt Thrower, and because he had a disease that made his hair fall out and gave him insecurity on stage. For at least one show in Germany, long time friend Dave Ingram stood in. Martin Kearns also decided to leave the band. The position at the drum kit is now taken by Alex Thomas. Karl Willetts temporarily rejoined the band to do vocal duties on their next album. The band switched record labels from Earache to Metal Blade Records, because since the US &quot;...For Victory&quot; tour they had seen a lack of success with Earache. Earache had also wanted to get rid of them and Bolt Thrower wanted to leave Earache as soon as possible, so they parted company.

The album titled &quot;Mercenary&quot; was released on 8 September 1998 in Europe and on 10 November 1998 in the US and features nine tracks. It is an overall slower album than its predecessors. However, it is definitely very heavy and sounds very much like classic Bolt Thrower. Karl also returned to performing his previous style of singing; the hardcore punk influences have disappeared again. After the album recording, Karl left the band again and the band recruited Dave Ingram permanently after he left Benediction.

In November 1998, Earache Records released &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;, a compilation featuring various older recordings, including the &quot;Spearhead&quot; and &quot;Cenotaph&quot; EPs. The band members themselves do not approve of the compilation&#x27;s release and warn not to buy it, considering it a cheap cash-in from Earache. Originally, it was titled &quot;No Guts - No Glory&quot; but the title was changed because one song on &quot;Mercenary&quot; has the same title and Metal Blade Records objected. Following the release of &quot;Mercenary&quot;, the band embarked on a tour of Europe, called &quot;Into the Killing Zone&quot;, with Dave Ingram on vocals. Alex Thomas departed since he lacked interest in the musical direction of Bolt Thrower.

After a short European tour in 2001 (which only consisted of 5 dates), they started to work on a new album. &quot;Honour - Valour - Pride&quot; was released in Europe on 19 November 2001, and in the United States on 15 January 2002 on Metal Blade Records, and shows a progression from the direction taken on &quot;Mercenary&quot;. It contains nine tracks; the digipak includes one bonus track. Martin Kearns returned to the band after he settled his things in his life.

===Reunion with Karl Willetts and &quot;Those Once Loyal&quot; (2004–2014)===
In 2004, the band began working on new material for their latest album. They intended to record it in May 2004, with the release set to the end of the year by Metal Blade. Meanwhile, a European tour and a US tour were being prepared. Unfortunately, right before the recording could begin, Dave Ingram decided to leave due to health and personal issues. This postponed the new record and tours, and priority was set to finding a new singer. On 18 November 2004 the band announced the return of Karl Willetts. Recording of the album, titled &quot;Those Once Loyal&quot;, started in May 2005; it was released on 11 November in Germany, 14 November in the rest of Europe and 15 November in the United States, 2005. It has been met with widespread critical acclaim from magazines such as &quot;Rock Sound&quot;, &quot;Rock Hard&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;. A European tour followed in January and February 2006. A second leg followed in April, with dates in Scandinavia, the UK, Spain and more.

Bolt Thrower announced that, as they were satisfied with the &quot;Those Once Loyal&quot; album, they would be indefinitely postponing the recording of another LP. The band stated that their goal was always to stop after releasing &quot;the perfect Bolt Thrower album&quot;. However, Karl Willetts had mentioned work on a ninth album.

Since releasing &quot;Those Once Loyal&quot;, Earache has released a remastered edition of the 1989 album &quot;Realm of Chaos&quot; featuring alternate artwork by John Sibbick, the artist responsible for the original artwork of both the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; Rogue Trader cover and &quot;Realm of Chaos - Slaves to Darkness&quot;. The band encouraged people not to buy it as, like &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;, it was released without their consultation let alone consent. Furthermore, it has been alleged that the band has not received royalties from Earache for a number of years.

===Death of Martin Kearns and disbandment (2015–2016)===
Martin Kearns, who had been Bolt Thower&#x27;s drummer from 1994 to 1997 and again since 2000, died unexpectedly at the age of 38 on 14 September 2015. As a result of his death, Bolt Thrower went on hiatus and cancelled their upcoming Australian tour, which would have been their first since 1993.

On 14 September 2016, the first anniversary of Kearns&#x27; death, Bolt Thrower announced on their website that they would not continue, explaining, &quot;We spent over 20 years together, touring the world, with 3 different vocalists, but he was so much more than just a drummer to us. So when we carried his coffin to his final resting place, the Bolt Thrower drummer position was buried with him. He was, and will now forever remain THE Bolt Thrower drummer, our Powerhouse and friend Martin &#x27;Kiddie&#x27; Kearns.&quot; Rumours of the band&#x27;s break-up were confirmed two days later by frontman Karl Willetts, stating, &quot;I can confirm that Bolt Thrower are definitely over for good. There will be no reunion tours etc... no compromise.&quot;

===Aftermath and reunion rumours (2017–present)===
On 7 March 2017, which would have been Kearns&#x27; 40th birthday, Bolt Thrower posted a lengthy statement on their website, which suggested that a reunion or possible new release in memory of him was in the works. As of 2025, these ideas have not materialised.

<text>Charles Antoine Coysevox ( or ; 29 September 164010 October 1720), was a French sculptor in the Baroque and Louis XIV style, best known for his sculpture decorating the gardens and Palace of Versailles and his portrait busts.

== Biography ==
Coysevox was born 29 September 1640 in Lyon. He was the son of a sculptor, from a family which had emigrated from Franche-Comté, a Spanish possession at the time. He made his first work of sculpture of the Madonna when he was only seventeen,

Coysevox came to Paris in 1657 and joined the workshop of the sculptor Louis Lerambert. He trained himself further by making copies in marble of Roman sculptures, including a &quot;Venus de Medici&quot; and the &quot;Castor and Pollux&quot;. In 1666, he married Marguerite Quillerier, Lerambert&#x27;s niece, who died a year after the marriage. In 1679, he married Claude Bourdict. In 1667 he was commissioned by the bishop of Strasbourg, Cardinal Fürstenberg, to statuary for his château at Saverne (Zabern).

In 1671, after four years spent working at Saverne, he returned to Paris. In 1676, his bust of the king&#x27;s painter Charles Le Brun gained him admission to the &quot;Académie Royale.&quot; He became part of the extraordinary team of sculptors, painters, and decorators, under the control of Le Brun, who between 1677 and 1685 produced the decoration of the Palace and Gardens of Versailles. Later, between 1701 and 1709, when Louis XIV built a new Château de Marly, where he could escape from the crowds and ceremony at Versailles, with Coysevox providing several works for that site.

Coysevox rose steadily in the artistic hierarchy. He became a professor at the Royal Academy in 1678, and then its director in 1702, with an annual pension of four thousand &quot;livres&quot;. In this position, he guided the training of a generation of French sculptors, including his nephews Nicolas Coustou (1659–1733) and Guillaume Coustou (1677–1746), who became important figures in French sculpture of the early 18th century.

Coysevox died in Paris on 10 October 1720.

===Monumental sculpture===
A large part of his work is found at the Palace of Versailles. One of his most famous works is the large stucco medallion of Louis XIV, found in the Salon of War in the Palace. The King is portrayed as a Roman Emperor on horseback, trampling his enemies, like a modern Caesar, gazing ahead to the future, as a figure of Victory offers him a crown of laurels.

He executed &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Force&quot; and the &quot;River Garonne&quot; at Versailles. Among his works from Marly are the &quot;Mercury&quot; and the equestrian &quot;Fame&quot; (1702) and four groups commissioned for the &quot;river&quot; in the château&#x27;s park; &quot;La Seine&quot; and its pendant at the head of the cascade, &quot;La Marne&quot;, &quot;Neptune&quot; and &quot;Amphitrite&quot;. Models in weather-resistant stucco were set up in 1699, replaced by marbles when they were finished in 1705. The groups were seized as &quot;biens nationaux&quot; in 1796 and dispersed: the &quot;Seine&quot; and &quot;Marne&quot; went to Saint-Cloud, and the &quot;Neptune&quot; and &quot;Amphitrite&quot; went to Brest in 1801.

Besides the works given above, he carved about a dozen funeral monuments, including those to Colbert (at Saint-Eustache), to Cardinal Mazarin (in the Louvre), and to the painter Le Brun (in the church of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet).

Between 1708 and 1710 Coysevox produced three further sculptures for Marly, a &quot;Pan&quot; (now in the Louvre), flanked by a &quot;Flora&quot; and a &quot;Dryad&quot; (in the Tuileries Gardens). A highly finished terracotta bozzetto or reduction of the &quot;Dryad&quot;, signed and dated 1709, is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.

For the facade of the dome of the royal chapel of Les Invalides, he sculpted a bust of Charlemagne, a pendant to the statue of Louis XI by another royal sculptor, Nicolas Coustou. On the upper level of the same chapel, he made a group of statues illustrating &quot;The Cardinal Virtues&quot;.
===Portrait busts===
Coysevox sculpted portrait busts of many of the celebrated men and women of his age. The faces of his busts were considered remarkably accurate; he did not flatter his subjects, but by the poses, detail and precision of the costumes he gave them a particular dignity. 
His subjects included Louis XIV and Louis XV, at Versailles; Colbert (the kneeling figure of his tomb at Saint-Eustache); Cardinal Mazarin, (in the church of the Collège des Quatre-Nations); Louis II de Bourbon; Louis, Grand Condé (in the Louvre); Maria Theresa of Austria; Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne; Vauban; the Cardinal de Bouillon; and de Polignac; the duc de Chaulnes (National Gallery of Art, Washington); Fénelon; Racine; André Le Nôtre (church of St-Roch); Bossuet (in the Louvre); the comte d&#x27;Harcourt; Cardinal Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg; and as Charles Le Brun (in the Louvre).

<doc id="838362" wikidata="Q12355187" url="?curid=838362" title="Systemantics">
<text>General Systemantics (retitled to Systemantics in its second edition and The Systems Bible in its third) is a systems engineering treatise by John Gall in which he offers practical principles of systems design based on experience and anecdotes.

It is offered from the perspective of how &quot;not&quot; to design systems, based on system engineering failures. The primary precept of the treatise is that large complex systems are extremely difficult to design correctly despite best intentions, so care must be taken to design smaller, less-complex systems and to do so with incremental functionality based on close and continual touch with user needs and measures of effectiveness.

== History ==
The book was initially self-published after Gall received rejection letters from 30 publishers. After several reviews in academic journals, it was picked up by Quadrangle–The New York Times Book Company, who published it in 1977. A condensed version was also published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; prior to the book&#x27;s publication.

== Title origin ==
The term systemantics is a commentary on prior work by Alfred Korzybski called general semantics which conjectured that all systems failures could be attributed to a single root cause – a failure to communicate. Gall observes that, instead, system failure is an &quot;intrinsic feature of systems&quot;. He thereby derives the term &quot;general systemantics&quot; in deference to the notion of a sweeping theory of system failure, but attributed to an intrinsic feature based on laws of system behavior. He observes as a side-note that system antics also playfully captures the concept that systems naturally &quot;act up.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;Money&quot; stated in 1978 that the author &quot;clearly set out to write another Peter Principle&quot;. A 1977 review in &quot;&quot; states that the book&#x27;s aim is unclear, commenting, &quot;As a put-down of institutional practices it works well, as good as anything in print&quot;, but &quot;As a slam at systems theory the book is less successful, even ambiguous.&quot; A &quot;Library Journal&quot; review from 1977 comments, &quot;Like some of its predecessors, the book pretends to rebuke people for their manifold stupidities, but is, in fact, an invitation to take pleasure in them. That&#x27;s not a failing, just a fact. Recommended.&quot; A 2004 review in the American Society of Safety Professionals&#x27; &quot;Professional Safety&quot; says, &quot;It is at once deadly serious with all the outrageous contrived irony of Gary Larson&#x27;s &#x27;Far Side&#x27; cartoons&quot; and that &quot;the book is one continuous insight after another.&quot; &quot;PCMag&quot; called the book &quot;small but insightful&quot;.

<text>The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, also called the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, is responsible for the rules of the United States Senate, administration of congressional buildings, and with credentials and qualifications of members of the Senate, including responsibility for contested elections. The committee is not as powerful as its House counterpart, the House Committee on Rules, as it does not set the terms of debate for individual legislative proposals, since the Senate has a tradition of open debate. Some members of the committee are also ex officio members of the Joint Committee on the Library and the Joint Committee on Printing.

==History==

The Committee was first created as the Select Committee to Revise the Rules of the Senate on December 3, 1867. On December 9, 1874, it became a standing committee.

On January 2, 1947, its name was changed to the Committee on Rules and Administration, and it took over the functions of the following committees:
* Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate
* Committee on Education and Labor (functions were later transferred to Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee)
* Committee on Enrolled Bills
* Committee on Privileges and Elections

==Jurisdiction==
In accordance of Rule XXV of the United States Senate, all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating primarily to the following subjects is referred to the Senate Rules Committee:
# Administration of the Senate Office Buildings and the Senate wing of the Capitol, including the assignment of office space;
# Congressional organization relative to rules and procedures, and Senate rules and regulations, including floor and gallery rules;
# Corrupt practices;
# Credentials and qualifications of Members of the Senate, contested elections, and acceptance of incompatible offices;
# Federal elections generally, including the election of the President, Vice President, and Members of the Congress;
# Nominations to fill a vacancy in the Vice Presidency;
# Government Printing Office, and the printing and correction of the Congressional Record, as well as those matters provided for under rule XI;
# Meetings of the Congress and attendance of Members;
# Payment of money out of the contingent fund of the Senate or creating a charge upon the same (except that any resolution relating to substantive matter within the jurisdiction of any other standing committee of the Senate shall be first referred to such committee);
# Presidential succession;
# Purchase of books and manuscripts and erection of monuments to the memory of individuals;
# Senate Library and statuary, art, and pictures in the Capitol and Senate Office Buildings;
# Services to the Senate, including the Senate restaurant; and,
# United States Capitol and congressional office buildings, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution (and the incorporation of similar institutions), and the Botanic Gardens.

The Senate Rules Committee is also charged:
# To make a continuing study of the organization and operation of the Congress of the United States and shall recommend improvements in such organization and operation with a view toward strengthening the Congress, simplifying its operations, improving its relationships with other branches of the United States Government, and enabling it better to meet its responsibilities under the Constitution of the United States;
# To identify any court proceeding or action which, in the opinion of the Committee, is of vital interest to the Congress as a constitutionally established institution of the Federal Government and call such proceeding or action to the attention of the Senate; and,
# To develop, implement, and update as necessary a strategic planning process and a strategic plan for the functional and technical infrastructure support of the Senate and provide oversight over plans developed by Senate officers and others in accordance with the strategic planning process.

<doc id="838374" wikidata="Q326000" url="?curid=838374" title="Maurice Halbwachs">
<text>Maurice Halbwachs (; 11 March 1877 – 16 March 1945) was a French philosopher and sociologist known for developing the concept of collective memory. Halbwachs also contributed to the sociology of knowledge with his &quot;La Topographie Legendaire des Évangiles en Terre Sainte&quot;, a study of the spatial infrastructure of the New Testament (1951).

==Early life and education==

Born in Reims, France, Halbwachs attended the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. There he studied philosophy with Henri Bergson, who had a major influence on his thinking. Halbwachs&#x27; early work on memory was in some measure pursued to coincide with Bergson&#x27;s view on the subject of memory being a particularly personal and subjective experience. Bergson taught Halbwachs for three years. He then aggregated in Philosophy in 1901. He taught at various &quot;lycées&quot; before traveling to Germany in 1904, where he studied at the University of Göttingen and worked on cataloging Leibniz&#x27;s papers until 1907. He was nominated to co-edit an edition of Leibniz&#x27;s work which never came to fruition.

He returned to France in 1905 and met Émile Durkheim, who sparked his interest in sociology. Initially, when meeting Durkheim, Halbwachs was looking for advice on how to move from his previous focus on Philosophy to Sociology. Halbwachs also began to focus on scientific objectivism rather than his Bergsonian Individualism. He soon joined the editorial board of &quot;L&#x27;Année Sociologique&quot;, where he worked with François Simiand and Lévy-Bruhl editing the Economics and Statistics sections. In 1909 he returned to Germany to study Marxism and economics in Berlin. Durkheim gave Halbwachs the idea of societal movements and how the environment, people are influenced by Sociological research. This also goes into how different class systems function in broad networks of society.

==Career==
Throughout World War I, Halbwachs worked at the War Ministry. Beginning in 1919, shortly after the end of the war, he became professor of sociology and pedagogy at the University of Strasbourg (1919). He remained in this position for over a decade, taking leave for a year in 1930 as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago, when he was called to the Sorbonne in 1935. There he taught sociology and worked closely with Marcel Mauss and served as the editor of &quot;Annales de Sociologie&quot;, the successor journal to &quot;L&#x27;Année Sociologique&quot;. He taught as a professor of sociology in Sorbonne, Paris from 1935 to 1943 and a professor of social psychology at the &quot;College de France&quot; from 1943 until death. From 1935 until his death he also served as the secretary-general of &quot;Annales de Sociologie&quot;. In 1944 he received one of France&#x27;s highest honors, a chair at the Collège de France in Social Psychology. During this time, Halbwachs dedicated his time to in-depth research in the field where sociology and psychology overlap to provide a bit of a timeline. 
Towards the end of his life, Halbwachs was recognized for his contributions to sociology. He was elected into the Conservative Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. He was also recognized as the Vice President of the French Psychological Society, while also being called to chair at Sorbonne.

==Personal life and death==
He was married to Yvonne Basch, who introduced Halbwachs to her father, the president of the League for the Defense Human Rights and also influenced him to join the Jewish religion (he was born Catholic). He had a son, Pierre Halbwachs, who influenced Deleuzian theory in the 1940s.

A longtime socialist, Halbwachs was detained by the Gestapo in Paris in July, 1944 after protesting the arrest of his Jewish father-in-law. He was deported to the concentration camp, Buchenwald, where he died of dysentery in February 1945.

In 1940, Halbwachs&#x27; brother in-law, Georges Basch committed suicide. His parents in-law Victor and Mme Basch aged 84 years old at the time were murdered by Germans.

Part of his books were offered by his widow to the library of the &quot;Centre d&#x27;études sociologiques&quot; and are now held at the Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS.

In 1950, his work on collective memory was published posthumously by his daughter.

==Main ideas==
Halbwachs&#x27; most important contribution to the field of sociology came in his book &quot;La Mémoire collective&quot;, 1950 (&quot;The Collective Memory&quot;), in which he advanced the thesis that a society can have a collective memory and that this memory is dependent upon the &quot;cadre&quot; or framework within which a group is situated in society. Thus, there is not only an individual memory but also a group memory that exists outside of and lives beyond the individual. An individual&#x27;s understanding of the past is strongly linked to this group consciousness because every person can contribute a different memory or perspective to the collective group memory. Group memory is also different for every group that experiences a certain event, therefore &quot;every group has its own collective memory and that collective memory differs from the collective memory of other groups. This idea of memory being pursued proves people&#x27;s expression of commemoration in our culture. Commemoration offers collective memory ties to society and its conceptions where physical monuments and rituals fix and affirm collectivity.

Halbwachs Collective Memory includes two laws governing how this form of memory will evolve: a Law of Fragmentation, and a Law of Concentration.

Halbwachs also wrote an important book on suicide, &quot;Les Causes du suicide&quot;, 1930 (&quot;The Causes of Suicide&quot;). In this book he followed the footsteps of his mentor Émile Durkheim (who was also a French Sociologist) expanding and elaborating upon the former&#x27;s theories on suicide. Specifically, he focused on ideas such as, the ways in which rural and urban styles of life explain variations in suicide rates. Halbwachs also continued to further Durkheim&#x27;s conceptualization of how specific family styles and religious backgrounds alter rates of suicide.

Halbwachs included in his &quot;Les Cadres Sociaux de la Memoire (1952)&quot; the significance of the collective memory operating on the systems of family, religion and social communities.

Halbwachs takes an interesting perspective regarding the relationship between memory and history. He believed that memory and history oppose each other when it comes to reliability. Memory can be transformed based on perspective, which makes it a questionable form of scholarly appreciation for the past. Whereas historians analyze history from a completely unbiased perspective, analyzing it in a critical way from a distance.

Halbwachs contributed to the world of social psychology as well with his thesis on &quot;La Classe ouvrière et les niveaux de vie&quot; which translates to, &quot;The Working Class and the Standards of Living&quot;. This work allowed Halbwachs to analyze and observe how working-class families managed their budgets. He discovered that families and individuals not only plan out their budget for what they need in the moment but what they also need in the future, which forces them to put into perspective what is necessary in the moment. His research is a modification of Durkheim&#x27;s theory of collective representation.

== Influence and legacy ==
Halbwachs showed how memory can not exist without society influencing the mind, embracing how collective consciousness impacts us each and every day. This taught us that social structure shapes the way we think an act on the world. He also establishes the difference between memory which is subjective and history is factual in its background.

== Inspirations ==
Halbwachs was influenced by ideas of Emile Durkheim, such as collective consciousness, with adding more to this term by individual and collective memory.

Halbwachs was also influenced by Henri Bergson&#x27;s stance on subjectivity, which creates states how this impacts our consciousness and intuition.

<doc id="838376" wikidata="Q70876" url="?curid=838376" title="Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg">
<text>Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg (2 December 162910 April 1704) was a German count and later prince of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg in the Holy Roman Empire. He was a clergyman who became bishop of Strasbourg, and was heavily involved in European politics after the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He worked for the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne and Louis XIV of France at the same time, and was arrested and tried for treason for convincing the Elector to fight on the opposite side of a war from the Empire.

==Early life==
Wilhelm was a younger son of Egon VIII of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg and Anna Maria of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. His father died in the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1635, when Wilhelm was young. Starting in 1637, Wilhelm attended the Gymnasium Tricoronatum with his elder brother, Franz Egon. There they met Maximilian Heinrich of Bavaria and formed friendships that would shape all their careers. Wilhelm then went on to study in Louvain in 1643, and after that to study theology in Rome in 1646. While there, he was presented to Pope Innocent X and made a favourable impression.

==Career==

In 1648, Wilhelm was made subdeacon in the cathedral chapter at Cologne, and the following year joined Franz as a member of the Archbishop-Elector&#x27;s privy council. In 1650, when their friend Maximilian inherited the role of Archbishop-Elector, Wilhelm and Franz gained significant influence in the court. In 1651, Cardinal Mazarin stayed in Cologne as a safe haven during the Fronde. During that time, he got to know Franz and Wilhelm, and to see the influence they had in Cologne and other lands within the Empire. He began to cultivate them as supporters of French aims within the Empire, supporting their interest in developing Rhineland defensive alliances. In 1656, the Cardinal gave Wilhelm control of the Abbey of St. Michel en Thiérache near Soissons.

===Impact in the empire===
When Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, died in 1657, Mazarin asked Wilhelm to help him influence the selection of the next Emperor, even going so far as to suggest Louis XIV of France for the role. Maximilian and the Electors of Mainz and Trier sent Wilhelm to Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria, to see if he would be willing to be put forth as the next Emperor, but he declined. Wilhelm also reported this result in person to the Cardinal and Louis XIV, and let them know that the French king did not have a reasonable chance with the electors. At this meeting, the Cardinal began negotiating with Wilhelm the fees and titles for him and his brother if they worked for French interests. The Cardinal instructed his lead negotiator in the Empire, Hugues de Lionne, to continue negotiating with the brothers for their support, indicating that the king would pay them eighteen thousand livres for ongoing dedicated work, regardless of the result of the election of the Emperor. Wilhelm insisted on a document spelling out the benefits offered, as he was concerned the French might leave him out to dry after he showed himself too strongly opposed to the Habsburgs. On 4 June 1658, Lionne, Franz, and Wilhelm signed an agreement detailing French support for the counts should they continue to work &quot;for all the plans and interests of His Majesty in Germany&quot;.

Following the coronation of Leopold I, Wilhelm and Franz contributed significantly to the establishment of the League of the Rhine in August 1658. This was supported and joined by the French as a further check against the new Habsburg Emperor. The Habsburgs tried to offer the brothers prizes and titles if they would halt the League&#x27;s formation, but they refused.

===International negotiations===
In 1659, Cardinal Mazarin asked Maximilian and Johann Philipp von Schönborn, the Elector of Mainz, to oversee negotiations to end the Franco-Spanish War. Maximilian thereafter sent Wilhelm regularly to the French court, to negotiations and ultimately to the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. In 1661, Wilhelm spent months in Paris conveying the suit of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who wished to marry Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier. While she rejected the offer, she did enjoy spending time with Wilhelm, admiring his intelligence and his knowledge of foreign affairs. In 1664, Leopold elevated the territory of Fürstenberg-Heligenberg from a county to a principality, and also extended the title of Prince to Franz and Wilhelm, though their brother ruled the territory. This was done to try to draw the brothers closer to Habsburg Austria, but did not appear to change much. As the representative from Cologne, Wilhelm drove the negotiations in 1665 and 1666 to end the involvement of Bernhard von Galen, the Bishop of Münster, in the Second Anglo-Dutch War so that they would not overly restrict the authority of the Bishop of Münster to wage war in the future.

When Philip IV of Spain died in 1665, the great powers wondered how long his heir, the sickly Charles II, would last. Wilhelm was put to work by France to begin negotiations related to the succession in Spain and in the Spanish Netherlands. In the run up to the War of Devolution, Wilhelm carried funds to Maximilian to fund the build-up of an army for Cologne. He also visited the Count Palatine of Neuburg, Philip Wilhelm, and the Elector of Bavaria to persuade them not to allow Austrian forces to move through their lands to oppose French maneuvers in the Netherlands. On 8 January 1667, Wilhelm went to Vienna representing Cologne (but acting on behalf of France) to sound out the Emperor&#x27;s feelings about the succession, perhaps splitting the Netherlands from Spain after the death of Charles. There he spent much time establishing relationships with various ministers at the court. He was offered titles and money to join the Habsburg side and work for the end of the League of the Rhine, but he demurred. He was also sought by Petar Zrinski, who wished his help (and thus French help) in a Hungarian revolution. Wilhelm avoided being seen too often with him. However, he did let Louis XIV know of the Hungarian revolutionaries, and their potential to provide an opportune diversion for Austrian forces. This laid the ground for a 1668 treaty between France and Austria agreeing that if Charles died without an heir, France would receive the Spanish Netherlands, the County of Burgundy, Navarre, the Philippines, the Two Sicilies, and Morocco, while the remaining Spanish territories would go to Austria.

In early 1668, Wilhelm was negotiating with Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt to try to come to an arrangement in the War of Devolution to partition the Spanish Netherlands between France and the Dutch Republic.

Early in 1669, he spent a month training with his French regiment in Lille. He had been appointed colonel of this regiment shortly before. This appointment made it even harder for others to believe he was not working directly for Louis XIV. However, Wilhelm was not above taking advantage of the French for personal gain. That July, he had his brother, Hermann Egon, arrange a meeting so that it would appear the Dutch were negotiating trade agreements with the League of the Rhine against France. This was done so that the French would give the brothers money that they would then use to purchase Mainau.

Wilhelm was instrumental in the preparations for the Franco-Dutch War. He went between France and numerous rulers in the Empire to try to build an unbeatable alliance for the attack on the Dutch. In 1670 he secured French support for the army of Cologne, guaranteeing the interests of Maximilian in the treaty. He then went to convince Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, to join the offensive alliance, though he was ultimately unsuccessful. By July 1671, Wilhelm convinced the Bishop of Münster to join the French alliance.

===Downfall and rescue===
During the negotiations in 1666 with Münster in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Wilhelm found himself opposed by the Elector of Brandenburg. In 1670, while attempting to get Brandenburg to join the French alliance in the Franco-Dutch War, Wilhelm also asked the elector about his opinion of a successor for Leopold I, who was sick at the time. Wilhelm suggested again Louis XIV as the next Emperor, but Brandenburg preferred the Duke of Neuburg. When Wilhelm went to leave, he was delayed by the disappearance of some of his baggage, which included his money and diplomatic papers. The bags turned up the next day without the money, so Wilhelm considered it simple theft. He did not notice that his papers had been searched, and that the document detailing his discussions and plans for the Emperor&#x27;s replacement was missing. This document would show up again as evidence of his treason against the Emperor at his trial. In 1671, the Elector of Brandenburg spoke many times to Leopold against the influence that Wilhelm was wielding on behalf of France, and the Emperor became more strongly opposed to Wilhelm&#x27;s work.

In 1672 the Emperor joined the Franco-Dutch War as an ally of the Dutch, finding himself opposed by several bishops in the northwest part of the Empire. The Fürstenberg brothers being regarded by the Imperialists as the main cause of this disaster, Wilhelm was arrested for treason on 14 February 1674 by imperial cavalry after chasing his carriage through Cologne. At the time of his arrest he was making ninety thousand livres a year from France. He was hurried off to Vienna and was tried for his life. He was saved by the intervention of the papal nuncio at Cologne, but was kept in prison until the signature of the Treaty of Nijmwegen in 1679.

As a reward for his services Louis XIV appointed him bishop of Strassburg in succession to his brother in 1682, in 1683 obtained for him from Pope Innocent XI the cardinal&#x27;s hat, and in 1688 succeeded in obtaining his election as coadjutor-archbishop of Cologne and successor to Maximilian. At the instance of the emperor, however, the pope interposed his veto on 26 August 1688; the canons followed the papal lead. Louis XIV attacked the Empire, citing this action as well as his sister-in-law&#x27;s claim to the inheritance of the Palatinate as his pretexts. As the progress of the Allies against Louis XIV in the Nine Years War deprived him of all prospect of success, Wilhelm Egon retired to France. He retired to his abbey of St-Germain-des-Prés near Paris, where he died on 10 April 1704.

==Personal life==
While in Brandenburg in 1670, Wilhelm met the twenty-two-year-old Katharine Charlotte von Wallenrodt. She was the daughter of a Saxon general, and married to Count Anton von Schleiden und Lumain. They began a love affair, and many contemporaries considered Wilhelm the father of her son born in 1674. Upon the death of her husband in 1680, Wilhelm took over as guardian for her three sons. In 1685 she married Wilhelm&#x27;s nephew, Emmanuel Franz Egon. She travelled with Wilhelm to his exile in France in 1689, and remained with him until his death.

<doc id="838378" wikidata="Q2486172" url="?curid=838378" title="Astral plane">
<text>The astral plane, also called the astral realm or the astral world, is a plane of existence postulated by classical, medieval, oriental, esoteric, and New Age philosophies and mystery religions. It is the world of the celestial spheres, crossed by the soul in its astral body on the way to being born and after death, and is generally believed to be populated by angels, spirits or other immaterial beings. In the late 19th and early 20th century the term was popularised by Theosophy and neo-Rosicrucianism.

Another view holds that the astral plane or world, rather than being some kind of boundary area crossed by the soul, is the entirety of spirit existence or spirit worlds to which those who die on Earth go, and where they live out their non-physical lives. It is understood by adherents that all consciousness resides in the astral plane. Some writers conflate this realm with heaven or paradise or union with God itself, while others do not. Paramahansa Yogananda wrote in &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; (1946), &quot;The astral universe ... is hundreds of times larger than the material universe ... [with] many astral planets, teeming with astral beings.&quot;

The &quot;World of &quot;Al-Ghaib&quot;&quot; and the &quot;World of &quot;Barzakh&quot;&quot; are related concepts in Islam (also the concept of &quot;imaginal world&quot; in Sufism). In Judaism, it is known as the &quot;World of &quot;Yetzirah&quot;&quot;, according to Lurianic Kabbalah.

== History ==

Plato and Aristotle taught that the stars were composed of a type of matter different from the four earthly (classical) elements – a fifth, ethereal element or quintessence. In the &quot;astral mysticism&quot; of the classical world the human psyche was composed of the same material, thus accounting for the influence of the stars upon human affairs. In his commentaries on Plato&#x27;s Timaeus, Proclus wrote the following:

Man is a little world (mikros cosmos). For, just like the Whole, he possesses both mind and reason, both a divine and a mortal body. He is also divided up according to the universe. It is for this reason, you know, that some are accustomed to say that his consciousness corresponds with the nature of the fixed stars, his reason in its contemplative aspect with Saturn and in its social aspect with Jupiter, (and) as to his irrational part, the passionate nature with Mars, the eloquent with Mercury, the appetitive with Venus, the sensitive with the Sun and the vegetative with the Moon.

Such doctrines were commonplace in mystery-schools and Hermetic and gnostic sects throughout the Roman Empire.

Among Muslims the &quot;astral&quot; world-view was soon rendered orthodox by Quranic references to the Prophet&#x27;s ascent through the seven heavens. Scholars took up the Greek Neoplatonist accounts as well as similar material in Hindu and Zoroastrian texts. The expositions of Ibn Sina (i.e.Avicenna), the Brotherhood of Purity and others, when translated into Latin in the Norman era, were to have a profound effect upon European medieval alchemy and astrology. By the 14th century Dante was describing his own imaginary journey through the astral spheres of Paradise.

Throughout the Renaissance, philosophers, Paracelsians, Rosicrucians, and alchemists continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between Earth and the divine. Once the telescope established that no spiritual heaven was visible around the Solar System, the idea was superseded in mainstream science.

== Astral experience ==

According to various occult teachings, the astral plane can be visited consciously through astral projection, meditation and mantra, near death experience, lucid dreaming, hypnosis, or other means. Individuals that are trained in the use of the astral vehicle can separate their consciousness in the astral vehicle from the physical body at will. The first stage in development, according to William Walker Atkinson (also known as Yogi Ramacharaka), is &quot;mastery of the physical body and its care and attention&quot;, which pertains not only to the physical body but also to its double in the astral. In addition, one must spend time tuning the &quot;instinctive mind&quot;. The first three subdivisions of the instinctive mind are passions, desires, and lusts. The second stage is the intellect, otherwise known as the sharpening of the mind. Someone operating largely out of the instinctive mind would &quot;have only a glimmering of intellect&quot;, similarly those who are centered in the intellect would only have an inkling of the third, &#x27;spiritual&#x27; stage of development. Once both earlier stages are completed the spiritual mind can be awakened.

In early theosophical literature the term &quot;astral&quot; may refer to the aether. Later theosophical authors such as Annie Besant and C. W. Leadbeater make the astral finer than the etheric plane but &quot;denser&quot; than the mental plane. In order to create a unified view of seven bodies and remove earlier Sanskrit terms, an etheric plane was introduced and the term &quot;astral body&quot; was used to replace the former kamarupa - sometimes termed the &quot;body of emotion, illusion or desire&quot;. Some of those propounding such claims explain their belief that letting go of desires is spiritual progress by noting that, the more one lets go of earthly &#x27;desire&#x27; feelings, the less tied down to the physical world, a world of illusion, and the more connected to the astral, where all is visible and known.

According to Max Heindel&#x27;s Rosicrucian writings, &quot;desire-stuff&quot; may be described as a type of force-matter, in incessant motion, responsive to the slightest &quot;feeling&quot;. The desire world is also said to be the abode of the dead for some time subsequent to death. It is also the home of the archangels. In the higher regions of the desire world thoughts take a definite form and color perceptible to all, all is light and there is but one long day.

In his book &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, Paramahansa Yogananda provides details about the astral planes learned from his guru. Yogananda claims that nearly all individuals enter the astral planes after death. There they work out the seeds of past karma through astral incarnations, or (if their karma requires) they return to earthly incarnations for further refinement. Once an individual has attained the meditative state of nirvikalpa samadhi in an earthy or astral incarnation, the soul may progress upward to the &quot;illumined astral planet&quot; of Hiranyaloka. After this transitional stage, the soul may then move upward to the more subtle causal spheres where many more incarnations allow them to further refine before final unification.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs deals with oversight of United States veterans&#x27; problems and issues.

==Description==
The committee was created in 1970 to transfer responsibilities for veterans from the Finance and Labor committees to a single panel. From 1947 to 1970, matters relating to veterans compensation and veterans generally were referred to the Committee on Finance, while matters relating to the vocational rehabilitation, education, medical care, civil relief, and civilian readjustment of veterans were referred to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.

Congressional legislation affecting veterans changed over the years. For the members of the armed forces and their families in the nation&#x27;s early wars – the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War and the Spanish–American War – the response of the federal government had been essentially financial. This was clearly the legislative mission of the Senate Committee on Pensions which was created as one of the Senate&#x27;s original standing committees in 1816 and continued until its termination in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946.

During World War I the nature of the congressional response to veterans&#x27; needs changed towards a more diversified set of programs. A war risk insurance program, which was referred to the Senate Finance Committee, changed the consideration of veterans benefits in the Senate. The Finance Committee was the Senate standing committee most responsible for veterans programs from 1917 to 1946. After World War II, the Finance Committee handled the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944, the GI Bill of Rights, which extended to servicemen and their families, a number of benefits including unemployment assistance, education, vocational training, housing and business loan guarantees, as well as the traditional medical and pension benefits of previous times. Many experts believe this law was one of the most important elements in the expansion of the middle class following World War II.

The Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee had nine members in its initial congress, the 92nd Congress (1971–73). It now has a total of 19 members.

==Members, 119th Congress==

According to committee members&#x27; official online biographies, five (Banks, Blumenthal, Duckworth, Gallego, Sheehy) of the nineteen members are veterans.

<doc id="838380" wikidata="Q530592" url="?curid=838380" title="Franz Egon von Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg">
<text>Franz Egon von Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg (10 April 1626 – 1 April 1682) was a German count in the Holy Roman Empire. He was prime minister for the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, and at the same time worked for Louis XIV of France influencing affairs in the Empire. Franz eventually became Prince-Bishop of Strassburg.

==Early life==
Born on 10 April 1626 in Heiligenberg, Franz was an elder son of Egon VIII of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg (1588–1635), who served with distinction as a Bavarian general in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.
Around 1640, Franz attended the Gymnasium Tricoronatum with his younger brother Wilhelm. There they met Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, forming a friendship which would guide all three careers.

==Career==
His religious career started early, joining the cathedral chapter at Cologne at age nine. By 1644 he was a member of the privy council of the Archbishop-Elector.

On the elevation of his friend Maximilian Heinrich to the position of Archbishop-Elector of Cologne in 1650, he went to his court and embraced the ecclesiastical career. Franz was made prime minister for Maximilian. He soon gained strong influence over the elector, and Franz and his brother Wilhelm were instrumental in guiding the Archbishop-Elector as a tool of the aggressive policy of Louis XIV of France.

In 1651, Cardinal Mazarin stayed in Cologne as a safe haven during the Fronde. During that time, he got to know Franz and Wilhelm, and to see the influence they had in Cologne and other lands within the Empire. He began to cultivate them as supporters of French aims within the Empire, supporting their interest in developing Rhineland defensive alliances.

Ecclesiastical preferments were heaped upon Franz. In 1655 he was appointed to a canonry in the chapters of Strassburg, Liège, and Hildesheim. These positions not only provided Franz with an income, but they allowed him to influence the selection of future office holders in these prince-bishoprics, thus gaining political influence. He later became suffragan bishop and dean of Cologne and provost of Hildesheim.

When Ferdinand III died in 1657, the Cardinal asked Franz to help him influence the selection of the next Emperor, even going so far as to suggest Louis XIV of France for the role. The Cardinal instructed his lead negotiator in the Empire, Hugues de Lionne to negotiate with the brothers for their support, indicating that the king would pay them eighteen thousand livres for ongoing dedicated work, regardless of the result of the election of the Emperor. At the convening of the Electors in Frankfurt in 1658, Franz hosted lavish parties for the Electors, and allowed the electors to meet with French representatives. One dinner he hosted for the Electors of Mainz and Saxony went from noon to nine, with the electors joining the dancing on the tables. On 4 June 1658, Lionne, Franz, and Wilhelm signed an agreement detailing French support for the counts should they continue to work &quot;for all the plans and interests of His Majesty in Germany&quot;. This included the Cardinal making Franz bishop of Metz.

Following the coronation of Leopold I, Franz and Wilhelm contributed significantly to the establishment of the League of the Rhine in August 1658. This was supported and joined by the French as a further check against the new Habsburg Emperor. The Habsburgs tried to offer the brothers prizes and titles if they would halt the League&#x27;s formation, but they refused.

When the previous prince-bishop of Strasbourg died in 1662, the crown of France offered large amounts of cash to get Franz elected as the successor. Leopold offered similar amounts of cash to get his cousin Sigismund Francis elected instead. Sigismund had to withdraw when he inherited Further Austria from his brother, so Franz was elected on 18 January 1663. Franz then asked Rome if he would be able to give up this title should another better one come along, as he still held hope of succeeding his friend as Archbishop-Elector of Cologne. Rome denied this request and he consented to the position without the pre-condition.

In 1664, Leopold elevated the territory of Fürstenberg-Heligenberg from a county to a principality, and also extended the title of Prince to Franz and Wilhelm, though their brother ruled the territory. This was done to try and draw the brothers closer to Austria, but did not appear to change much.

Later he was also prince-abbot of Luders and Murbach and abbot of Stablo and Malmedy.

In 1673, Franz moved into the newly renovated Château des Rohan (Mutzig), which became the residence of the bishops of Strasbourg.

On the conclusion of a treaty between the emperor and the elector of Cologne, on 11 May 1674, Franz was deprived of all his preferments in Germany, and was compelled to take refuge in France. He was, however, amnestied with his brother William by a special article of the Treaty of Nijmegen (1679), whereupon he returned to Cologne. After the French occupation of Strasbourg (1681) he took up his residence there and died on 1 April 1682.

<text>The Calgary Cowboys were an ice hockey team that played two seasons in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1975 to 1977. The Cowboys played at the Stampede Corral in Calgary. The franchise was founded in 1972 as the Miami Screaming Eagles, though it never played a game in Miami. The team was based in Philadelphia and Vancouver, known in both markets as the &quot;Blazers&quot;, before relocating to Calgary. The franchise folded in 1977.

==History==
===Miami, Philadelphia and Vancouver===
Originally in 1972, the franchise was to be based out of Miami, Florida, called the Miami Screaming Eagles. But due to money problems and a lack of a suitable arena, they never played a game in Miami. Instead, they moved to Philadelphia and debuted as the Philadelphia Blazers the same year. After only one season in Philadelphia, the team relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, and became the Vancouver Blazers in 1973–74, then two years later relocated to Calgary to become the Cowboys in 1975–76.

===Calgary===
In 1972, the fledgling WHA attempted to place a team in Calgary, to be known as the Broncos in the hopes of a rivalry with Edmonton, and the Oilers. When the team&#x27;s owner, Bob Brownridge, suddenly died before the WHA&#x27;s inaugural season, the team abruptly moved to Cleveland to become the Crusaders (having never played a single game as the Calgary Broncos). This prompted the Oilers to rename themselves the Alberta Oilers, with the intention of splitting their home schedule between the two cities. This plan similarly failed to materialize, and the Oilers dropped the Alberta moniker after one season, calling Edmonton their exclusive home. Calgary would get its second chance in the WHA in 1975, when the Vancouver Blazers moved across the Rocky Mountains. Owner Jim Pattison, failing in his goal of taking the Vancouver market away from the NHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks chose to relocate to Calgary. However, by the time the WHA did arrive, the league was already in difficulty, and the team was viewed as minor-league, despite the presence of aging superstars such as Gordie Howe and Bobby Hull in the league.

The franchise played out of the 6,500 Stampede Corral, knowing that its small size would prevent the team from achieving profitability initially. They were hoping for strong attendance figures that would encourage the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede board, who owned and operated the Corral, to expand the facility to 15,000 seats. Such an expansion had been planned by the Stampede board, but with no timelines, and no commitment to finance it.

In their first season, the Cowboys were not expected to ice a strong team, having inherited a franchise that finished in a last place tie with the Oilers the previous year. Calgary finished 41–35–4 however, as a 44-goal season by Danny Lawson and 42 goals from Ron Chipperfield helped the Cowboys finish a surprising third in the Canadian division.

In the 1976 playoffs, the Cowboys met the Quebec Nordiques in the first round. The series is best known for one of hockey&#x27;s most legendary brawls. The incident began when Calgary&#x27;s Rick Jodzio cross-checked Quebec&#x27;s Marc Tardif in the head, causing both teams to leave their benches. The brawl lasted 20 minutes, and ended only when Quebec police gathered at the players benches and escorted the teams back to their dressing rooms. Following a 20-minute break to allow both teams to cool down, the game resumedminus eleven ejected players. The incident caught the attention of Quebec&#x27;s Solicitor General Fernand Lalonde, who had the incident investigated as a criminal matter. Jodzio was suspended indefinitely by the league, and later pleaded guilty in a Quebec court to a charge of assault over the incident. Cowboys coach Joe Crozier was suspended for the rest of the series.

Calgary went on to defeat the Nordiques, who had finished 18-points ahead of Calgary in the regular season, but were defeated by the Winnipeg Jets in the second round. The team never really captured the attention of Calgarians, as fewer than 5,000 fans, on average, attended playoff games against the Jets.

During the 1976–77 season, attendance fell to below 4,500 per game. Rumours abounded that the franchise would move again, to Ottawa, though it completed the season in Calgary. Team owner, Jim Pattison, attempted to keep the Cowboys afloat in 1977–78, with the ultimate hope of being a part of the expected amalgamation with the National Hockey League. During preliminary discussions between the two leagues, it was proposed that six WHA teams merge into the NHL. However, the Corral&#x27;s capacity was barely half of the NHL&#x27;s then-minimum capacity of 12,500 seats. When the NHL made it clear it had no interest in a team playing out of the Corral even as a temporary facility, it was expected that Pattison would request a two-year leave of absence in the hopes of building a new arena. The NHL voted down the 1977 merger plan, while only 2,000 fans purchased season tickets for the 1977–78 season. With no imminent hope for a new arena, Pattison chose to fold the franchise on August 18, 1977.

Calgary had to wait only three years for the NHL to arrive, however. The Atlanta Flames relocated to the city in 1980–81 as the Calgary Flames. The move came after the WHA had finally merged with the NHL, with its three remaining Canadian teams all surviving to join the NHL. More importantly, by 1980 a strong and ultimately successful bid to host the 1988 Winter Olympics had been submitted to the International Olympic Committee, and as part of this bid serious plans were in the works for a new NHL-sized arena. With the promise of a new home, the NHL allowed the move. The Flames played in the Corral as a temporary home until moving into the Saddledome in 1983.

The last active player from the Cowboys was Warren Miller who retired during the 1982-83 NHL season. The last active former Cowboy was George Pesut who played in Germany until 1994.

===Honoured members===
One Hockey Hall of Famer played for the Cowboys. Harry Howell finished his 24-year professional career in 1975–76 with Calgary, playing 31 games and recording three assists. At the time of his retirement, Howell had played more major-league hockey games than any other defenceman in history at 1,581.

<text>The Macedonian Wars (214–148 BC) were a series of conflicts fought by the Roman Republic and its Greek allies in the eastern Mediterranean against several different major Greek kingdoms. They resulted in Roman control or influence over Greece and the rest of the eastern Mediterranean basin, in addition to their hegemony in the western Mediterranean after the Punic Wars. Traditionally, the &quot;Macedonian Wars&quot; include the four wars with Macedonia, in addition to one war with the Seleucid Empire, and a final minor war with the Achaean League (which is often considered to be the final stage of the final Macedonian War). The most significant war was fought with the Seleucid Empire, and both this and the wars with Macedonia effectively marked the end of these empires as major world powers, even though neither of them led immediately to overt Roman domination. Four separate wars were fought against the weaker power, Macedonia, due to its geographic proximity to Rome, though the last two of these wars were against haphazard insurrections rather than powerful armies. Roman influence gradually dissolved Macedonian independence and digested it into what was becoming a leading empire. The outcome of the war with the now-deteriorating Seleucid Empire was ultimately fatal to it as well, though the growing influence of Parthia and Pontus prevented any additional conflicts between it and Rome.

From the close of the Macedonian Wars until the early Roman Empire, the eastern Mediterranean remained an ever shifting network of polities with varying levels of independence from, dependence on, or outright military control by, Rome. According to Polybius, who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate the Greek east in less than a century, Rome&#x27;s wars with Greece were set in motion after several Greek city-states sought Roman protection against the Macedonian Kingdom and Seleucid Empire in the face of a destabilizing situation created by the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt.

In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only Rome was capable of pacifying. This had some important similarities (and some important differences) to what had occurred in Italy centuries earlier, but was this time on a continental scale. Historians see the growing Roman influence over the east, as with the west, not as a matter of intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on accomplishing short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule (such as parts of mainland Greece), the eastern Mediterranean world remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot;) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It wasn&#x27;t until the time of the Roman Empire that the eastern Mediterranean, along with the entire Roman world, was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.

==First Macedonian War (214 to 205 BC)==

During the Second Punic War, Philip V of Macedon allied himself with Hannibal. Fearing possible reinforcement of Hannibal by Macedon, the senate dispatched a praetor with forces across the Adriatic. Roman maniples (aided by allies from the Aetolian League and Pergamon after 211 BC) did little more than skirmish with Macedonian forces and seize minor territory along the Adriatic coastline in order to &quot;combat piracy&quot;. Rome&#x27;s interest was not in conquest, but in keeping Macedon busy while Rome was fighting Hannibal. The war ended indecisively in 205 BC with the Treaty of Phoenice. While a minor conflict, it opened the way for Roman military intervention in Macedon. This conflict, though fought between Rome and Macedon, was largely independent of the Roman-Macedon wars that followed (which began with the Second Macedonian War and were largely dependent on each other) in the next century.

==Second Macedonian War (200 to 196 BC)==

The past century had seen the Greek world dominated by the three primary successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire: Ptolemaic Egypt, Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire. The imperial ambitions of the Seleucids after 230 BC were particularly destabilizing. The Seleucids set out to conquer Egypt, and Egypt responded with a major mobilization campaign. This campaign led to military victory against Seleucid incursions, but in 205 BC when Ptolemy IV was succeeded by the five-year-old Ptolemy V (under a regency), Egypt broke into a major civil war between north and south. Seeing that all of Egypt could now be conquered easily, the Macedonians and Seleucids forged an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt between themselves.

This pact represented the most significant threat to the century-old political order that had kept the Greek world in relative stability, and in particular represented a major threat to the smaller Greek kingdoms which had remained independent. As Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire were the source of the threat, and Egypt was in turmoil, the minor Greek kingdoms turned to Rome for assistance. This diplomatic development represented a major change, as the Greeks had recently shown little more than contempt towards Rome, and Rome little more than apathy towards Greece. Ambassadors from Pergamon and Rhodes brought evidence before the Roman Senate that Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire had signed the non-aggression pact. Although it is unclear what was the exact nature of this treaty and the exact Roman reason for getting involved despite decades of apathy towards Greece (the relevant passages on this from our primary source, Polybius, have been lost), the Greek delegation was successful in eliciting Roman aid. Initially, Rome did not intend to fight a war against Macedon, but rather to intervene on their behalf diplomatically.

Rome gave Philip an ultimatum that he must cease in his campaigns against Rome&#x27;s new Greek allies. Doubting Rome&#x27;s strength (not an unfounded belief given Rome&#x27;s performance in the First Macedonian War) Philip ignored the request, which surprised the Romans. Believing their honor and reputation on the line, Rome escalated the conflict by sending an army of Romans and Greek allies to force the issue, beginning the Second Macedonian War. Surprisingly (given his recent successes against the Greeks and earlier successes against Rome), Philip&#x27;s army buckled under the pressure from the Roman-Greek army. Roman troops led by then consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus reached the plain of Thessaly by 198 BC. In 197 BC the Romans decisively defeated Philip at the Battle of Cynoscephalae, and he sued for peace. In the resulting Treaty of Tempea, Philip V was forbidden from interfering with affairs outside his borders, and was required to relinquish his recent Greek conquests. At the Olympiad in 196 BC Rome proclaimed the &quot;Freedom of the Greeks&quot;, which constituted Rome&#x27;s (arguably misguided) new policy towards Greece. This was that Greece was now stable and Rome could completely remove itself from Greek affairs without risking more instability. It seemed that Rome had no further interest in the region, as they withdrew all military forces without even attempting to consolidate any gains, and subsequently returned to their prior apathy even when their Greek allies ignored later Roman requests.

==Seleucid War (192 to 188 BC)==
With Egypt and Macedonia now weakened, the Seleucid Empire became increasingly aggressive and successful in its attempts to conquer the entire Greek world. When Rome pulled out of Greece at the end of the Second Macedonian War, they (and their allies) thought they had left behind a stable peace. However, by weakening the last remaining check on Seleucid expansion, they left behind the opposite. Now not only did Rome&#x27;s allies against Philip seek a Roman alliance against the Seleucids, but Philip himself even sought an alliance with Rome. The situation was made worse by the fact that Hannibal was now a chief military advisor to the Seleucid emperor, and the two were believed to be planning for an outright conquest not just of Greece, but of Rome also. The Seleucids were much stronger than the Macedonians had ever been, given that they controlled much of the former Persian Empire, and by this point had almost entirely reassembled Alexander the Great&#x27;s former empire. Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilization, all but pulling out of recently pacified Spain and Gaul. They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever invaded Italy. This fear was shared by Rome&#x27;s Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier to the mighty Persian Empire). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia, resulting in a complete Roman victory. The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Though they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the beginning of the end of the Seleucid empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the Parthians) and the west (the Greeks), as well as Judea in the South. Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by Pontus. Following Magnesia, Rome pulled out of Greece again, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace, though it did the opposite.

==Third Macedonian War (172 to 168 BC)==

Upon Philip&#x27;s death in Macedon (179 BC), his son, Perseus of Macedon, attempted to restore Macedon&#x27;s international influence, and moved aggressively against his neighbors. When Perseus was implicated in an assassination plot against an ally of Rome, the Senate declared the third Macedonian War. Initially, Rome did not fare well against the Macedonian forces, but in 168 BC, Roman legions smashed the Macedonian phalanx at the Battle of Pydna. Convinced now that the Greeks (and therefore the rest of the world) would never have peace if Greece was left alone yet again, Rome decided to establish its first permanent foothold in the Greek world. The Kingdom of Macedonia was divided by the Romans into four client republics. Even this proved insufficient to ensure peace, as Macedonian agitation continued.

==Fourth Macedonian War (150 to 148 BC)==

The Fourth Macedonian War, fought from 150 BC to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne, named Andriscus, attempting to re-establish the old Kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna. In response, the Achaean League in 146 BC mobilized for a new war against Rome. This is sometimes referred to as the Achaean War, and was noted for its short duration and its timing right after the fall of Macedonia. Until this time, Rome had only campaigned in Greece in order to fight Macedonian forts, allies or clients. Rome&#x27;s military supremacy was well established, having defeated Macedonia and its vaunted Phalanx already on 3 occasions, and defeating superior numbers against the Seleucids in Asia. The Achaean leaders almost certainly knew that this declaration of war against Rome was hopeless, as Rome had triumphed against far stronger and larger opponents, the Roman legion having proved its supremacy over the Macedonian phalanx. Polybius blames the demagogues of the cities of the league for inspiring the population into a suicidal war. Nationalist stirrings and the idea of triumphing against superior odds motivated the league into this rash decision. The Achaean League was swiftly defeated, and, as an object lesson, Rome utterly destroyed the city of Corinth in 146 BC, the same year that Carthage was destroyed. After nearly a century of constant crisis management in Greece, which always led back to internal instability and war when Rome pulled out, Rome decided to divide Macedonia into two new Roman provinces, Achaea and Epirus.

<doc id="838384" wikidata="Q1348290" url="?curid=838384" title="Nicolas Coustou">
<text>Nicolas Coustou (; 9 January 1658 – 1 May 1733) was a French sculptor and academic.

==Biography==
Born in Lyon, Coustou was the son of a woodcarver, François Coustou, who gave him his first instruction in art, and Claudine Coysevox. When he was eighteen years old, in 1676, he moved to Paris, to study under C. Antoine Coysevox, his maternal uncle, who presided over the recently established Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. At the age of twenty-three, Coustou won the Colbert prize (the Prix de Rome), which entitled him to four years of education at the French Academy at Rome. He subsequently became rector and chancellor of the Academy of Painting and Sculpture. From 1700, he worked with Coysevox at the palaces of Marly and Versailles.


He was remarkable for his facility. Influenced by Michelangelo and Algardi, he tried to combine the best characteristics of each.

A number of his works were destroyed during the French Revolution; the most famous of those that remain are &quot;La Seine at la Marne&quot;, the &quot;Berger Chasseur&quot;, and &quot;Daphne Pursued by Apollo&quot; in the gardens of the Tuileries, the bas-relief &quot;Le Passage du Rhin&quot; in the Louvre, the statues of Julius Caesar and Louis XV in the Louvre, and the &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; behind the choir altar of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. His sculpture of Apollo pursuing Daphne is one of a pair bearing the single title that was created with his younger brother, who is ascribed as the sculptor of Daphne. Both have been in the Louvre since 1940 and were restored between 2004 and 2006.

Regularly, he worked closely with his brother, Guillaume Coustou, also a renowned sculptor and director of the academy. Because of their collaborations, it is not always possible to ascribe a particular work to one or the other, thus one may find a single sculpture ascribed to each of them. His brother&#x27;s son, Guillaume Coustou the Younger, also was a sculptor.

Nicolas Coustou died in Paris in 1733 at the age of 75.

<text>Bavarians (; Standard German: &quot;Bayern&quot;) are an ethnographic group of Germans of the Bavaria region, a state within Germany. The group&#x27;s dialect or speech is known as the Bavarian language, native to Altbayern (&quot;Old Bavaria&quot;), roughly the territory of the Electorate of Bavaria in the 17th century.

Like the neighboring Austrians, Bavarians are traditionally Catholic. In much of &quot;Altbayern&quot;, membership in the Catholic Church remains above 70%,
and the center-right Christian Social Union in Bavaria (successor of the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party of 1919–1933) has traditionally been the strongest party in the Landtag, and also the party of all minister-presidents of Bavaria since 1946, with the single exception of Wilhelm Hoegner, 1954–1957.

==Areal and dialectal subdivision==

There is no linguistic distinction between Bavarians and Austrians. The territory of Bavaria has changed significantly over German history; in the 19th century the Kingdom of Bavaria acquired substantial territories of Franconia and Swabia, while having to return territories to Austria who had become Bavarian only a few years earlier. Thus, only three of the seven administrative regions of the state of Bavaria are culturally Bavarian: Upper Bavaria (Oberbayern), Lower Bavaria (Niederbayern) and the Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz), to the exclusion of Bavarian Franconia (historically inhabited by Franks) and Bavarian Swabia (inhabited by Swabians).

The Bavarian language is divided into three main dialects:
* Upper Palatinian (&quot;Oberpfälzisch&quot;) is spoken in northern Bavaria (Bohemian Forest, Regensburg). 
* Danube Bavarian (&quot;Donaubairisch&quot;) is spoken in central and south-eastern Bavaria and in Central and Lower Austria (Munich, Salzburg, Vienna). 
* Alpine Bavarian is spoken in south-western Bavaria, in southern Austria (Tyrol, Carinthia, Styria) and in South Tyrol.

==History==

===Origins===

The &quot;Baiuvarii&quot; were the early Bavarians, who are known from records starting in the 6th century. Their name indicates a connection to the Bohemian Forest area, which had been the territory of the Boii during antiquity, although the nature of this connection is uncertain. The name is Latinized from the ethnonym *Bajōwarjōz, meaning &quot;citizens of Bohemia&quot; from Proto-Germanic *Bajōhaimaz (Boiohaemum, Bohemia), meaning &quot;Boii home&quot;, which was a term already mentioned by Tacitus in his &quot;Germania&quot; at the end of the 1st century AD, by which time parts of the Celtic Boii had already left the area, leaving it to be dominated by Suevic Germanic groups in close contact with the Romans, such as the Marcomanni in what is now the Czech Republic, and their neighbours the Hermunduri and Varisci in what is now northern Bavaria. On the southern side of the river Danube were the Vindelici in the Roman-controlled province of Raetia.

Bavarians are first mentioned in the mid-6th century, in the foothills north of the Alps, on both sides of the Danube. It is difficult to distinguish the mobile and mixing groups of the Danube in this period archaeologically. The timing comes after the period when the neighbouring Alamanni (to the west) and Thuringians (to the north) had come under Frankish hegemony, and in Italy the kingdoms of Theoderic and Odoacer had come to an end, creating a new power vacuum in the Alpine region. They seem to have been closely related to the Lombards who were developing as a force to the east of them. Their legal system shows heavy Roman influence, and their unification appears to have been under a Duke installed by the Franks (Old Bavarian law codes refer to five main lineages).

The Danubian frontier between the Roman empire and &quot;Germania&quot; had by this time become a region where older populations had been added to significantly by generations of Roman border troops, Germanic clients, and then various &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples from outside the empire, some of whom had been under the hegemony of Attila the Hun. &quot;Elbe Germans&quot;, came from the river Elbe to the north, which was under Thuringian rule, and is where the Lombards had also been. But also more northern groups had moved along the Elbe from the direction of the North Sea, as did some Saxons who joined the Lombards, and possibly the Heruls. Also, East Germanic groups such as the Goths had entered the Pannonian region east of the Bavarians in the generations leading up to the empire of Attila. These peoples had not only contributed to the Hunnic empire, but also sometimes been settled peacefully as Roman &quot;foederati&quot;.

Also entering the area, more contemporary with the Bavarians and Lombards, were Slavs, who particularly settled the Upper Palatinate as well as around Regensburg itself (distr. Großprüfening).

Neighboring the emerging Bavarian people in the 6th to 7th centuries were the Alamanni to the west (with the river Lech as boundary, which remains a dialectal division today), and Thuringians to the north, both dominated to some extent by the Franks as were the Bavarians (in the late 7th century however, there was a period where Radulf, King of Thuringia rebelled and some independence was returned to these three regions for a while).) Slavs were settling to the north-east, and Goths and Langobards to the east and south were later displaced by Slavs and Magyars.

Much like was the case in neighboring Alemannia, Bavaria was nominally Christian by virtue of being ruled by Christian dukes from the 6th century, but Christianization of its population was a gradual process lasting throughout the 7th century and into the 8th; Saint Corbinian was sent by Pope Gregory II to minister to duke Grimoald and work towards the evangelization of Bavaria; he became the first bishop of Freising. A Diocese of Laureacum (Lorch) had been in existence since the 4th century, in the 8th century moved to Passau, which became a bridge-head for the Christianization of Austria and Hungary. The Bishopric of Regensburg was founded in 739 by Boniface. The Lex Baiuvariorum was a codex of Germanic law, comprising 23 articles of traditional law recorded in the 740s. Bavaria within the Carolingian Empire was bordering on Swabia in the west, Thuringia in the north, Lombardy in the south and Slavic Carinthia in the east.

===Holy Roman Empire===
The Duchy of Bavaria was a stem duchy of the Holy Roman Empire, established in the 10th century, derived from an earlier duchy ruled by the Frankish Agilolfings during the 6th to 8th centuries.
The Margraviate of Austria was formed an eastern march to the Duchy of Bavaria in 976, and became a duchy in its own right, the Duchy of Austria, in 1156, in the 13th century falling under the dominion of the House of Habsburg.
In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies (or &quot;partial duchies&quot;, &quot;Teilherzogtümer&quot;) existed after the division of 1392: Lower Bavaria-Straubing, lower Bavaria-Landshut, Bavaria-Ingolstadt and Bavaria-Munich.

Munich, now the capital and cultural center of Bavaria, was founded in the high medieval period, and was the capital 
of the &quot;partial duchy&quot; of Bavaria-Munich 1392–1503. In 1503, Bavaria was re-united by Duke Albrecht IV of Bavaria-Munich (although the formerly Bavarian offices Kufstein, Kitzbühel and Rattenberg in Tirol were lost in 1504) and established Munich as the capital of all of Bavaria in 1506.
In 1623, Bavaria was elevated to Electorate (&quot;Kurfürstentum&quot;).

===Modern history===

The Kingdom of Bavaria was established at the Peace of Pressburg (1805), in the wake of the French victory at Austerlitz. The kingdom&#x27;s territory fluctuated greatly over the following years, eventually fixed at the Treaty of Paris (1814), which established most of what remain the borders of the modern state. The kingdom in 1837 was divided into eight administrative regions (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;), &quot;Upper Bavaria&quot;, &quot;Lower Bavaria&quot;, &quot;Franconia&quot;, &quot;Swabia&quot;, &quot;Upper Palatinate&quot; and &quot;Palatinate&quot;. 
Ludwig I of Bavaria changed his royal titles to &quot;Ludwig, King of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia, Duke in Swabia and Count Palatinate of the Rhine&quot;.

As of 1818, the total population of the kingdom was at 3.7 million, rising to 4.4 million by 1840 and to 6.2 million by 1900, reaching 6.5 million in 1910. Modern Bavaria has 12.5 million inhabitants (as of 2012); 
the population of Altbayern or Bavaria proper is at 6.7 million.

<text>Gregory Michael Luzinski (born November 22, 1950), nicknamed &quot;the Bull&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a left fielder from to , most prominently as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies where he was a four-time All-Star player and was a member of the 1980 World Series winning team.

Luzinski was the National League (NL) RBI champion and, in he was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for his involvement in local community affairs. He ended his career playing for the Chicago White Sox. In 1998, Luzinski was inducted into the Philadelphia Phillies Wall of Fame.

==Biography==
Born in Chicago, Luzinski attended Notre Dame High School in Niles, Illinois. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies with the 11th overall pick in the 1968 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut on September 9, 1970, at age 19, pinch-hitting for the Phillies in a loss to the New York Mets at Shea Stadium.

==Playing career==
At and weighing , Luzinski was a well-liked Phillie. He was a poor defensive left fielder but a feared slugger with a good batting average despite frequent strikeouts. He hit .300 or better for three consecutive seasons during the prime of his career, and was a career .276 hitter, with 307 home runs, and 1,128 RBIs. Luzinski was selected to be a National League (NL) All-Star every year between 1975 and 1978, highlighted by the home run he hit off Jim Palmer in the 1977 All-Star Game. In 1978, Luzinski was the top NL All-Star vote-getter. He was also the National League’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) runner-up in 1975 when he led the National League with 120 RBIs and 322 total bases; and in 1977, when he posted career highs in batting average (.309), home runs (39), and RBIs (130).
He hit safely in every postseason game — and had at least one home run in each of the three National League Championship Series (NLCS)—played by the Phillies from 1976 to 1978, though Philadelphia did not advance to the World Series in any of those years. In the ninth inning of pivotal Game 3 of the 1977 NLCS, Luzinski misplayed a two-out Manny Mota fly ball, trapping the ball against the left-field wall and allowing the inning to continue. The Dodgers scored three runs in the inning and won the game, and eventually won the series.

One of the first Phillies to buy seats at games for impoverished children, Luzinski was honored with the Roberto Clemente Award in 1978. In 1980, he suffered a major slump with injuries in the regular season, batting just .228, with 19 home runs, and 56 RBIs in 106 games, but came back with two game-winning hits in the 1980 National League Championship Series: a two-out two-run home run in the bottom of the 6th inning in Game 1 (the only home run hit in the entire 1980 NLCS); and a pinch-hit RBI double to score Pete Rose in the top of the 10th inning of Game 4, as Philadelphia went on to beat the Houston Astros in five games. Those hits against Houston, the biggest hits of his career, were among the most significant in franchise history; that team went on to bring the Phillies their first world championship, beating the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 World Series, 4 games to 2. At one time, Luzinski held the consecutive-game-hitting streak record for a league championship series with 13.

He joined the Chicago White Sox the next season and became one of the top sluggers and designated hitters in the American League. With the White Sox, he was chosen the Designated Hitter of the Year for 1981 and also in 1983, the season when he set a then-record for most home runs in a season by a designated hitter with 32, and thrice hit the roof of the old Comiskey Park in Chicago. Luzinski hit five home runs in five consecutive games, a franchise mark, which has since been tied by Ron Kittle, Frank Thomas (twice), Carlos Lee, and Paul Konerko. Luzinski returned to the postseason in the 1983 American League Championship Series, which the Sox lost to Baltimore three games to one.

Luzinski also hit grand slams in two consecutive games in 1984. Luzinski became a free agent at the end of the 1984 season but chose to retire on February 4, 1985.

==Post-retirement==
From his retirement from professional baseball in 1985 until 1992, Luzinski was the head baseball coach, and later head football coach, at Holy Cross Academy in Delran Township, New Jersey.

Still a fan favorite in Philadelphia, he started &quot;Bull&#x27;s Barbecue&quot; in Section 104 at Citizens Bank Park when the Phillies opened the new stadium in 2004. The barbeque stand was inspired by &quot;Boog&#x27;s BBQ&quot; at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and Luzinski can usually be found there until after the seventh inning for all Phillies home games.

He lives in Bonita Springs, Florida.

His son, Ryan, was the first-round pick of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Ryan was a promising power hitter when he spurned a letter of intent with the University of Miami to sign with the Dodgers. However, he bounced around the team&#x27;s farm system until a trade to the Baltimore Orioles in 1997. In eight minor league seasons, he hit .265 with 49 home runs and 296 RBI but could never make the move from AAA to the Majors.

==Honors and awards==

The Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to a Major League Baseball player who demonstrates sportsmanship and community involvement, was presented to Luzinski in 1978.

In 1989, Luzinski was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs is a committee of the United States Senate charged with oversight in matters related to the American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native peoples. A Committee on Indian Affairs existed from 1820 to 1947, after which it was folded into the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. A new Native Affairs Committee was created in 1977, initially as a select committee, as a result of the detachment of indigenous affairs from the new Committee on Energy and National Resources, which had succeeded the old Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. The committee was initially intended to be temporary, but was made permanent in 1984. The committee tends to include senators from Western and Plains states, who have more Native American constituents.

==History==

===Summary===
In 1977, the Senate approved which re-established the Committee on Indian Affairs as a temporary select committee. The Select Committee was to disband at the close of the 95th Congress, but following several interim extensions, the Senate voted to make the Committee permanent on June 6, 1984. The committee has jurisdiction to study the unique problems of American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native peoples and to propose legislation to alleviate these difficulties. These issues include, but are not limited to, Native education, economic development, land management, trust responsibilities, health care, and claims against the United States. Additionally, all legislation proposed by Members of the Senate that specifically pertains to American Indians, Native Hawaiians, or Alaska Natives is under the jurisdiction of the committee.

===Early era===
Until 1946, when the Legislative Reorganization Act abolished both the House and Senate Committees on Indian Affairs, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs had been in existence since the early 19th century. After 1946, Native affairs legislative and oversight jurisdiction was vested in subcommittees of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate. While this subcommittee arrangement may not have specifically reflected a diminishment of the consideration given Native affairs by the Congress, the revised arrangement historically coincided with a 20-year hiatus in Native affairs known as the &quot;Termination Era&quot; – a period in which the prevailing policy of the United States was to terminate the Federal relationship with Native tribes or transfer jurisdiction over tribal lands to the states.

By the mid-1960s, this Termination philosophy was in decline as a failed policy and the Congress began to include Native tribes in legislation designed to rebuild the social infrastructure of the Nation and provide economic opportunities for economically depressed areas. In the early 1970s the Termination era was decisively ended with the enactment of the Menominee Restoration Act of 1973. Although a number of important legislative initiatives affecting Natives were enacted in the early 1970s, it became clear that the existing subcommittee structure was not providing an adequate forum for legislating appropriate solutions to problems confronting Native country. Legislative jurisdiction over Native affairs was fragmented among a number of committees. Overall, more than 10 committees in the Congress were responsible for Indian affairs, a situation which resulted in a sometimes disjointed treatment of Native affairs and in an often haphazard development of Federal Native policy.

===Re-establishment of committee===
In 1973, Senator James Abourezk introduced to establish a Federal commission to review all aspects of policy, law, and administration relating to affairs of the United States with American Native tribes and people. The Senate and the House of Representatives both adopted S.J. Res. 133 and on January 2, 1975, the Resolution was signed into law by the President, thus establishing the American Indian Policy Review Commission. As the work of this Commission progressed, it became readily apparent that a full Senate committee with full legislative and oversight authority was needed to receive the report of the American Indian Policy Review Commission and to act upon its recommendations. Indeed, one of the final recommendations of the Commission was that a full-fledged Native Affairs Committee be established in the Senate.

At the same time the Commission was formulating its recommendation for the establishment of a Native Affairs Committee, the Senate was developing a far-reaching proposal for reorganization of the entire Senate committee system. Under this proposal, the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs under the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs was to be abolished with its natural resource functions to be distributed among other newly formed Senate committees and its human resources functions to be transferred to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. In view of the pending report of the American Indian Policy Review Commission and its anticipated recommendations, however, the Senate revamped its committee reorganization proposal to include the establishment of a temporary select committee to receive the Commission&#x27;s report and to act on its recommendations. Thus, there was included within of February 4, 1977, the Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977, a provision to establish a Select Committee on Native Affairs with full jurisdiction over all proposed legislation and other matters relating to Native affairs. With the commencement of the 96th Congress, the Select Committee on Indian Affairs was to expire and jurisdiction over Native matters was to be transferred to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.

As the Select Committee on Indian Affairs grappled with the report of the American Indian Policy Review Commission and the many other Native issues that were presented to it during the 95th Congress, it became increasingly evident that if the Congress was to continue to meet its constitutional, legal, and historical responsibilities in the area of Native affairs, an ongoing legislative committee with adequate expertise and resources should be re-established in the Senate.

, to make the Select Committee on Indian Affairs a permanent committee of the Senate, was introduced by Senator Abourezk on February 22, 1978. The measure was amended by the Rules Committee to extend the life of the committee for two years until January 2, 1981, and was agreed to by the Senate on October 14, 1978. In the 96th Congress, Senator John Melcher, who was at the time chairman of the Select Committee, introduced to make it a permanent committee. The Resolution had 28 cosponsors, and was reported by the Rules Committee with an amendment to extend the select committee to January 2, 1984, and to expand the membership to seven members commencing in the 97th Congress. S. Res. 448 was adopted by the Senate on December 11, 1980.

===Permanent committee===
On April 28, 1983, Senator Mark Andrews, Chairman of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs in the 98th Congress, introduced to make the committee a permanent committee. This Resolution had 28 cosponsors. On November 1, 1983, the Committee on Rules and Administration voted unanimously to report the Resolution without amendment, and the Resolution was so reported on November 2, 1983 (S. Rept. 98–294). On November 18, the last day of the first session of the 98th Congress, the Senate agreed to an extension of the select committee to July 1, 1984, in order to allow time for later debate. By the time the Resolution was brought to the floor for consideration there were 60 cosponsors. On June 4, 1984, the Select Committee on Indian Affairs was made a permanent committee of the Senate. In 1993, the Select Committee on Indian Affairs was redesignated as the Committee on Indian Affairs.

In 1969, Reyn Guyer, a Minnesota-based games inventor, and Minnesota Vikings kicker Fred Cox came to the company with a football game that was safe for indoor play, and after studying it carefully, Parker Brothers decided to eliminate everything but the foam ball. The inventors&#x27; in-house name for the ball was the &quot;falsie-ball,&quot; referencing the sculpted padding for bras used to create the appearance of larger breasts. Parker Brothers instead chose the name &quot;Nerf,&quot; taken from Nerf bars, the protective tubing used to avoid minor collisions during off-roading.

In 1970, the Nerf ball was introduced as the &quot;world&#x27;s first official indoor ball.&quot; Marketing slogans promised that one can &quot;Throw it indoors; you can&#x27;t damage lamps or break windows. You can&#x27;t hurt babies or old people.&quot; Some of the first TV commercials for the balls were joint promotions with General Foods&#x27; Kool-Aid drink mix, with Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Michael Nesmith of the Monkees playing with the balls on a living room soundstage (Kool-Aid sponsored the 1969–70 Saturday morning reruns of the Monkees&#x27; 1966–67 TV series). The ball filled a strong consumer need and by the year&#x27;s end, more than four million Nerf balls had been sold. The ball was followed by a large version called the &quot;Super Nerf Ball&quot;. Shortly after, in 1972, a basketball game called &quot;Nerfoop&quot; and the Nerf football (developed by longtime NFL kicker Fred Cox) joined the family, with the latter quickly becoming Nerf&#x27;s most popular ball.

The company continued to add to the Nerf line until they handed control to Kenner Products, a sister company. In 1987, Kenner was bought by the Tonka Corporation, which itself was purchased by Hasbro in 1991, which then became the owner of Nerf. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the Nerf brand served under the subsidiaries OddzOn and Larami before Hasbro took full control of the brand.

Nerf released the first foam dart blaster in 1992. Over the years, Nerf has continued to expand the line, adding new looks to existing products, with later lines of Nerf products ranging from sport balls and foam dart blasters to video games and accessories.

In February 2013, Hasbro announced the release of its &quot;Rebelle&quot; line, a sub-line aimed at girls, with its first products released in fall of 2013.

In November 2013, POW! Books published &quot;The Ultimate Nerf Blaster Book&quot;. Written by Nathaniel Marunas, the book highlights the history of Nerf and provides details on every N-Strike, Dart Tag, and Vortex blaster produced at the time of the book&#x27;s release.

In 2015, the Rival line of blasters was first released. The first products released were the Rival Apollo XV-700 and the Rival Zeus MXV-1200. These blasters fire a new type of ammunition, known as &quot;High Impact Rounds&quot;, which are small foam balls that can reach a higher velocity than foam darts. The Rival line is targeted towards an older audience, with each product listing the age of 14+ on the box.

In 2021, the Hyper line of blasters was announced. Initial products included the Hyper Rush-40, Hyper Siege-50, and Hyper Mach-100. Hyper rounds are similar in design to Rival rounds, but are smaller and made of a thermoplastic elastomer material that is more rubber-like than the foam used in Rival rounds.

===Nerf Blasters===
Nerf&#x27;s most popular product type are Nerf blasters, which are toy plastic guns that shoot foam darts. These darts have different-style tips, including Velcro-tipped in order to stick to Nerf vests (typically shipped with Dart Tag blasters), suction cup darts designed to stick to smooth surfaces, streamlined darts to fit into magazines (referred to as clips by Nerf), and darts able to whistle in flight. Darts may also have different colors, such as colors that reflect certain sub-lines, camouflage, and glow in the dark. Most Nerf blasters also have rails, known as tactical rails, which can accommodate different attachments, as well as special adapters such as barrel and stock adapters. The &quot;N-strike&quot; sub-line was launched in 2004, and is styled more like a real weapon than previous Nerf products. It was updated in 2012 as N-Strike Elite.

====Rebelle====
Released in 2013, the Rebelle line was a series of blasters predominantly aimed at the female demographic, with similar internal mechanics to the Nerf N-Strike elite line, sporting pink, purple and teal colors.

====Zombie Strike====
The Zombie Strike line was launched in 2013, and is geared for fans of Humans vs. Zombies games. All blasters have a distinct zombie apocalypse theme, with newer blasters featuring a DIY aesthetic.

====Rival====
Nerf Rival blasters (branded as RIVAL) fire small foam balls referred to by Nerf as &quot;High Impact Rounds&quot;, but usually referred to as “Rival Balls” or &quot;Rival Rounds&quot; by the Nerf community. Nerf Rival blasters are targeted towards an older target market than Nerf&#x27;s better-known dart blasters.

====Nitro====
In 2017, Hasbro released the Nerf Nitro line, which consists of blasters that fire foam cars into obstacles and stunt ramps.

====Ultra====
Released in September 2019, Nerf Ultra (branded as ULTRA) blasters fire a new, proprietary dart design that is marketed as &quot;THE FARTHEST FLYING DART EVER. Darts can travel up to 120 feet.&quot; The new Ultra darts are constructed from a lightweight foam that is notably different from traditional darts in that they are made with closed-cell, rather than open-cell foam. This construction allows for fins to be molded into the rear of the darts. Size-wise, Ultra darts are between N-Strike Elite darts and Mega darts in diameter, but shorter than both in length. They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines&#x27; darts be fired from Ultra blasters. This design was created in response to the growing number of third-party darts, including exact knockoffs from China, available for N-Strike Elite blasters at a much lower cost than Nerf-brand darts.

===N-Series===

In 2024, Nerf Released the Nerf N-Series, which featured a new N-1 dart, similar to the Nerf Ultra darts. These new blasters were only compatible to said dart. Hasbro plans to phase out the Elite dart with the N-1.

===Super Soaker===
Originally owned and marketed by Larami, Super Soaker is a popular line of water guns. Recently, Hasbro has released a line of Nerf-branded Super Soaker blasters.

===Lazer Tag===
Lazer Tag, a popular laser tag toy line from the mid-1980s, is also currently part of the Nerf banner. The current generation of Lazer Tag blasters attach to iPhones or iPod Touch units for enhanced playability.

===Nerf Dog===
In June 2013, Hasbro and Grammercy Products unveiled Nerf Dog, a line of Nerf-inspired canine retrieving toys made of rubber, nylon, and plastic. Nerf Dog was launched at Walmart stores, and debuted at pet specialty stores in Fall 2013.

Based in Secaucus, N.J., Gramercy Products, Inc. is the manufacturer of Nerf Dog products.

The Nerf Dog Tennis Ball Blaster mimics traditional Nerf blaster designs and shoots a ball up to 50 feet in the air. The toy uses special softer balls to reduce the risk of injury.

===Video games===
Nerf has also produced video game accessories for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo DSi, DS Lite, 3DS and the Wii. Visionary Media, Inc. released the first-person shooter &quot;Nerf Arena Blast&quot; (or &quot;NAB&quot;, sometimes &quot;Arena Blast&quot;) in 1999. EA Games, in association with Hasbro, released the 2008 video game &quot;Nerf N-Strike&quot; and its 2009 sequel &quot;Nerf N-Strike Elite&quot;. Both games feature the Switch Shot EX-3, which doubles as a functional dart blaster and a Wii Remote accessory. In June 2019, Raw Thrills released the Nerf Arcade game. GameMill Entertainment published &quot;Nerf Legends&quot;, a first-person shooter game released on 19 November 2021 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. In 2021, an online multiplayer first-person shooter titled &quot;Nerf Strike&quot; was developed by The Gang Stockholm and released by Metaverse Team under license from Hasbro on the online platform &quot;Roblox&quot;. In August 2022, developers Secret Location under licence from Hasbro released the Virtual reality game multiplayer shooter titled &quot;NERF Ultimate Championships&quot; for the Meta Quest 2 platform. In February 2023 Secret Location announced on a now deleted developer update on the Meta Horizon Store listing that the studio was shutting down, meaning that support for &quot;NERF Ultimate Championships&quot; will soon end it will be delisted off the Meta Horizon Store.The game was shut down and subsequently delisted on August 31, 2023. April 2023, they collaborated with the game &quot;Stumble Guys&quot; to add a Nerf-themed mini game to their game.

==Awards==
In 2011, the Nerf N-Strike Stampede ECS was awarded &quot;Boy Toy of the Year&quot; and the Nerf Super Soaker Shot Blast won &quot;Outdoor Toy of the Year&quot; at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the American International Toy Fair in New York City.

In 2014, the Nerf Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow won the award for &quot;Best Action Toy&quot; at the 2014 U.K. Toy Fair.

==Legal issues==
In June 2010, Hasbro sued Buzz Bee Toys and Lanard Toys for patent violation of its Nerf and Super Soaker brands. The lawsuit stated that Buzz Bee and Lanard infringed two U.S. patents for the Nerf N-Strike Disc Shot blaster, while Buzz Bee infringed on a Super Soaker patent. In November of that year, Hasbro won its patent case against Buzz Bee with the latter banned from producing certain water guns.

In April 2012, Hasbro contacted the Australia-based fan blog &quot;Urban Taggers&quot; for leaking information on unreleased Nerf products found on the Chinese marketplace website Taobao. Hasbro allegedly tricked one of the bloggers into disclosing his home address for their lawyers to mail him a cease and desist letter. The incident resulted in fans setting up a campaign on Facebook boycotting Hasbro.

<doc id="838393" wikidata="Q1358924" url="?curid=838393" title="Guillaume Coustou the Elder">
<text>Guillaume Coustou the Elder (; 29 November 1677, Lyon – 22 February 1746, Paris) was a French sculptor of the Baroque and Louis XIV style. He was a royal sculptor for Louis XIV and Louis XV and became Director of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1735. He is best known for his monumental statues of horses made for the Château de Marly, whose replicas now stand in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.

==Life==
Coustou was a member of a family of famous sculptors; his uncle, Antoine Coysevox, was a royal sculptor; his elder brother, Nicolas Coustou was a sculptor, and his son Guillaume Coustou the Younger also become a noted royal sculptor. Like his older brother, he won the (Prix de Rome) of the Royal Academy which entitled him to study for four years at the French Academy in Rome. However, he refused to accept the discipline of the academy, gave up his studies, set out to make his own career as an artist. He worked for a time in the atelier of the painter Pierre Legros, and eventually returned to Paris.

Upon his return to Paris, he assisted his uncle Coysevox in making two monumental equestrian sculptures, &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Mercury&quot;, for the Château de Marly, the new residence of Louis XIV near the Palace of Versailles, where he went to escape the crowds and ceremony of the palace. He later (1740–1745), made his own horses, the &quot;Marly Horses&quot;, his most famous works, to replace them. The horses reinvent the theme of the colossal Roman marbles of the Horse Tamers in the Piazza Quirinale, Rome. They were commissioned by Louis XV in 1739 and installed in 1745 at the &quot;Abreuvoir&quot; (&quot;Horse Trough&quot;) at Marly. The horses were considered masterpieces of the grace and expressiveness of the French Late Baroque or Rococo style. After the Revolution they were moved from Marly to the beginning of the Champs-Élysées on the Place de la Concorde. The originals were brought indoors for protection at the Louvre Museum in 1984.

Coustou was received into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1704. The work he made to mark his entrance was &quot;Hercules on the Pyre&quot;, now in the Louvre. It displays the special hallmark of the Baroque, a twisting and rising transverse pose, as well as highly skillful carving. 

Following the death of &quot;directeur&quot; Louis de Boullogne on 28 November 1733, the painter Hyacinthe Rigaud proposed that the four rectors of the Académie, Coustou, Claude-Guy Hallé, Nicolas de Largillière, and himself, rotate the post. This oligarchy would persist until the election of Coustou as sole director on 5 February 1735.

Coustou also created two colossal monuments, &quot;The Ocean&quot; and the &quot;Mediterranean&quot; among other sculptures for the park at Marly; the bronze &quot;Rhone&quot;, which formed part of the statue of Louis XIV at Lyons, and the sculptures at the entrance of the Hôtel des Invalides. Of these latter, the bas-relief representing Louis XIV mounted and accompanied by Justice and Prudence was destroyed during the Revolution, but was restored in 1815 by Pierre Cartellier from Coustou&#x27;s model; the bronze figures of Mars and Minerva (1733–34), on either side of the doorway, were not interfered with.

In 1714 for Marly he collaborated in two marble sculptures representing &quot;Apollo Chasing Daphne&quot; (both at the Louvre), in which Nicolas Coustou sculpted the Apollo and Guillaume the Daphne. About the same time he was commissioned to produce another running figure in marble, a &quot;Hippomenes&quot; designed to complement an &quot;Atalanta&quot; copied from the Antique by Pierre Lepautre: each was placed at the center of one of the carp pools at Marly.

In 1725, the Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin, Duke of Antin, general director of the &quot;Bâtiments du Roi,&quot; commissioned a pair of life-size marbles of &quot;Louis XV as Jupiter&quot; and &quot;Marie Leszczyńska as Juno&quot; for the park of his Château de Petit-Bourg, which adjoined the park of Versailles, to which it was added after the Duke&#x27;s death.

A number of his sculptures were for the Tuileries Gardens, most notably a bronze &quot;Diane à la biche&quot; (&quot;Diana and a Deer&quot;), and &quot;Hippoméne&quot; (1714), which was originally in the goldfish pond at Marly, then moved to the Tuileries until 1940, when it was brought into the Louvre.

Coustou&#x27;s marble &quot;Bust of Samuel Bernard&quot; is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Guillaume often worked with his brother Nicolas Coustou, particularly in the decoration of royal domestic architecture at Versailles.

<text>The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics is a select committee of the United States Senate charged with dealing with matters related to senatorial ethics. It is also commonly referred to as the Senate Ethics Committee. Senate rules require the Ethics Committee to be evenly divided between the Democrats and the Republicans, no matter who controls the Senate. However, the chairman always comes from the majority party. The leading committee member of the minority party is referred to as the &quot;Vice Chairman&quot; rather than the more common &quot;Ranking Member&quot;.

==History==
The Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct was first convened in the 89th Congress (1965–66) and later replaced by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics in the 95th Congress (1977–78).

== Membership ==
Pursuant to Senate Rule 25, the committee is limited to six members, and is equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. This effectively means that either party can veto any action taken by the committee.

<doc id="838401" wikidata="Q609017" url="?curid=838401" title="Willie Miller">
<text>William Ferguson Miller MBE (born 2 May 1955) is a Scottish former professional football player and manager, who made a club record 560 league appearances for Aberdeen. Sir Alex Ferguson described Miller as &quot;the best penalty box defender in the world&quot;.

==Club career==
Born in Glasgow, Miller was raised in the Bridgeton area of Glasgow. He had little interest in football as a child, and when he did become drawn to the game he played initially as a goalkeeper. He was scouted by several professional clubs while playing as a forward with Glasgow Schools and Eastercraigs Boys Club.

Having been on unofficial schoolboy terms in 1969, Miller signed full-time for Aberdeen in 1971 at the age of 16 and spent a season on loan with Peterhead in the Highland League, scoring 24 goals; upon his return he was converted to a central defender/sweeper in the reserves on the advice of Teddy Scott, winning the SFL Reserve Cup in 1973, established himself in that position in the first team in place of Henning Boel, and by 1975 had been made captain by manager Ally MacLeod.

Miller&#x27;s central defensive partnership with Alex McLeish was integral to Aberdeen&#x27;s success in the 1980s, as they won all the major domestic honours and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1983. He made at least 40 appearances for Aberdeen in 14 consecutive seasons, amassing a total of 12 trophies won as well as appearing in several other finals. His total of 797 competitive appearances for the club is comfortably (by more than 100 matches) the all-time record.

He retired from playing in 1990 due to an injury picked up whilst playing for Scotland. A farewell testimonial match in his honour took place in December 1990 with Aberdeen facing a &#x27;World Cup XI&#x27; (featuring Kenny Dalglish, David O&#x27;Leary, Mark Hughes and Danny McGrain among others) at Pittodrie Stadium. He had already received a testimonial in 1981 against Tottenham Hotspur.

In 2003, Willie Miller was voted the greatest Aberdeen player of all time in a poll to mark the club&#x27;s centenary. In 2015 it was no surprise when he was named in Aberdeen&#x27;s &#x27;greatest ever team&#x27; by supporters of the club.

Miller was voted Scottish Football Writers&#x27; and SPFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in 1984. He had been runner-up for the SFWA award in 1983.

==International career==
Having appeared at under-21 and under-23 level, Miller won 65 full international caps for Scotland between 1975 and 1989, scoring one goal. His 50th cap came against West Germany during the 1986 FIFA World Cup. His international career was effectively ended by an injury suffered during the last game of 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification. Although he did not play in the 1990 FIFA World Cup finals, Miller was presented with the match ball from Scotland&#x27;s 1–0 loss to Brazil to thank him for his contribution to Scottish football.

He was an inaugural inductee to the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2004, and is also on the international roll of honour, having won 50 international caps. In 2010, Miller was chosen as one of the eleven members of &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Greatest Team&quot;, by viewers of the Scottish Television documentary series, which sought the fans&#x27; opinion on the best Scotland players since the 1960s. Viewers also chose Alex McLeish as his partner in central defence.

==Managerial career==
In February 1992, he was appointed Aberdeen manager, replacing the sacked Alex Smith. Despite two second-place finishes in the league and two losing cup finals in 1992–93, Miller was sacked in February 1995 with the club in danger of being relegated for the first time in its history (survival was eventually achieved via a playoff).

In May 2004, Miller was appointed to the Aberdeen board and given executive responsibility for football. He played a large role in the appointment of Jimmy Calderwood (a friend from their Glasgow Schools days) as manager, as well as progressing the club&#x27;s youth academy.

In June 2011, he was appointed as Aberdeen&#x27;s Director of Football Development, with the responsibility of finding new playing talent for the club. He departed again in 2012.

==Career outside football==
Miller has worked for the BBC, particularly for Radio Scotland, as a football commentator and analyst. He has written two autobiographies, &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Don&quot;, the latter being published in 2007. His third book, &quot;Willie Miller&#x27;s Aberdeen Dream Team&quot;, was published in 2011.

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum Miller was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

<text>Darren Michael Jessee (born April 8, 1971) is an American musician best known as the drummer of the alternative rock trio Ben Folds Five. He has also worked as an instrumentalist for Sharon Van Etten and Hiss Golden Messenger and released three solo albums and four albums as singer and songwriter for indie band Hotel Lights. His first solo album, &quot;The Jane, Room 217&quot;, was released on August 24, 2018, to near-universal acclaim from critics.

Jessee formed indie band Hotel Lights in 2004, with whom he has recorded four studio albums and an extended play. Ben Folds, on an iTunes Originals compilation, credited the Jessee-penned chorus for &quot;Brick&quot; as the missing element to a song that he had tried to compose for a long time.

Jessee can also be heard drumming on the song &quot;Strangest Thing&quot; from The War on Drugs&#x27; 2017 album &quot;A Deeper Understanding&quot;, Hiss Golden Messenger&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah Anyhow&quot; (2017), and Josh Rouse&#x27;s album &quot;Under Cold Blue Stars,&quot; released in 2002.

<text>Laser was a debit card scheme in Ireland between 1996 and 2014.

The Laser scheme was maintained and operated by Laser Card Services Ltd., a not for profit body owned by four leading financial institutions in Ireland and overseen since 2008 by the Oversight Unit of the Central Bank. The scheme was launched in April 1996, and in 2010, there were almost three million Laser cards in circulation.

195 million transactions worth almost €11.2 billion were carried out on those cards in 2009. From 2007, the financial institutions which had issued Laser cards began to replace them with Visa or MasterCard debit cards. Laser cards were withdrawn from the market on 28 February 2014.

==Use==
Laser was primarily an electronic point of sale debit card, but could also be used by telephone and internet, at ATMs and to pay regular bills by direct debit.

When purchasing goods or services with a Laser card up to €100 cashback could be given to cardholders and this value was simply added to the purchase price. Some retailers set a lower maximum cashback value, depending on what cash was available to them in the till or their own policy. Many Irish businesses that operate online accepted Laser cards prior to their discontinuation.

From 2005, some Laser card holders were provided with co branded Laser/Maestro cards; from 1 January 2008, all Laser cards were co branded. The co branded cards were chip and PIN cards with both Laser and Maestro functions. The Laser facility was for use in Ireland only whereas the Maestro facility was, in theory, used both domestically and internationally, but international Maestro payments were quite often rejected.

The Maestro facility was not usable internationally online or by telephone. While it was possible for any bank in the Single Euro Payments Area, regardless of location, to join the Laser card scheme, no interest in joining the scheme was expressed by banks outside Ireland.

==Participating financial institutions==
In 2007, Halifax Ireland announced that it would be the first bank in Ireland to offer a Visa Debit card rather than the Laser debit card (Halifax was never a member of Laser Card Services Limited). In 2008, Ulster Bank dropped Laser, in favour of Visa Debit. Permanent TSB withdrew Laser cards and began to replace them with Visa Debit cards in September 2010.

In the end of October 2010, Bank of Ireland announced they were ceasing their involvement in the partnership in 2011.

On 9 February 2011, EBS Building Society said that it would issue MasterCard debit cards instead of Laser from the second half of 2011.

In July 2011, AIB announced that it would cease issuing Laser cards from 2011, leaving National Irish Bank as the final issuer in the Laser card system, leading to speculation that the scheme would close in 2012. It was reported that banks were turning away from Laser because of some difficulties encountered by consumers in making online purchases.

However, customers began to complain almost immediately about numerous difficulties caused by the premature withdrawal of Laser cards. Some retailers who were able to give cashback on Laser cards were unwilling or unable to do so on the replacement cards; Permanent TSB issued a second replacement Visa Debit card to its customers in April 2011 due to the initial replacement chip and some older terminals not being compatible (resulting in refusal of cashback).

Other retailers who had been charged a small flat-rate per-transaction fee for Laser transactions found that they were charged a percentage of the value of the transaction for the replacement cards. Organisations such as Betfair which did not charge customers for Laser card transactions began to charge these customers 1.5% commission on transactions using the replacement Visa Debit cards.

Merchant services companies did not advertise whether there were any differences in their charges for the two types of debit card. Some customers reported being charged foreign transaction fees on Visa Debit cards in Northern Ireland, which had not been charged on the old cards.

===Website and e-commerce system gateways===
Ogone, ICEPAY, WorldPay, Netbanx.com, Moneybookers.com, CreditCall, DataCash, Realex, TNS and SagePay provided Laser payment gateways.

<doc id="838406" wikidata="Q932924" url="?curid=838406" title="What Is This?">
<text>What Is This (known prior to 1980 as Anthym) was an American rock band that originated in Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, California. Formed by guitarist Hillel Slovak, drummer Jack Irons, vocalist Alain Johannes, and bassist Todd Strassman, the band served as the nucleus for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Members of the band would go on to perform with Eleven, Chris Cornell, Pearl Jam, Mark Lanegan, Them Crooked Vultures, Alain Johannes Trio and Queens of the Stone Age.

== History ==
Originally named Chain Reaction, the band would later change its name to Anthem, then later to Anthym (as there was already a band using the former moniker), and then finally to What Is This, which was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the reaction they usually received from first-time listeners.

During their tenure as Anthym, guitarist Hillel Slovak became acquainted with an audience member at one of their shows, Anthony Kiedis, who was then brought on as a roadie and &quot;hype-man&quot; for the band. After a while, the band began to find bassist Todd Strassman&#x27;s musical abilities unsatisfactory, so they considered replacing him. Slovak decided to teach a friend of his at Fairfax, trumpet player Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary, how to play bass. Soon he replaced Strassman as What Is This&#x27; bassist. After graduating high school, the band began to play gigs in the Los Angeles area. Flea eventually left the band to play in the punk band Fear and was replaced by Chris Hutchinson.

Around this time, Slovak and Jack Irons decided to play a show with Anthony Kiedis and Flea under the name Tony Flow and the Majestic Masters of Mayhem at the Rhythm Lounge. It consisted of the musicians improvising a punk funk jam (like Defunkt or James Chance and the Contortions) while Kiedis rapped a poem he wrote titled &quot;Out in L.A.&quot; It was intended to be a one-time performance, but the show was received so well that they were asked to return again the following week. The group decided to change their name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, played several more shows at various Los Angeles clubs and musical venues, and eventually recorded a demo tape, all while Slovak and Irons were still playing with What Is This. A few months later, What Is This received a record deal with MCA Records, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers received a joint deal with EMI America and Enigma Records. Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons decided to leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers and stay with What Is This as the latter was their primary musical project while the former was seen as side endeavor.

What Is This released their debut EP &quot;Squeezed&quot; in 1984. Around this time, Hillel Slovak had become uncertain of his role in the band and decided to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He left What Is This in 1985, midway through the recording of their only full length album, called &quot;What Is This?&quot;. At this point, and for their final EP &quot;3 Out of 5 Live&quot;, the band was a trio. After this, the band broke up.

Alain Johannes later met Natasha Shneider and the duo formed Walk The Moon, whose sole studio album featured Jack Irons and Chris Hutchinson on several tracks. Jack Irons later rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1986, but would then leave in 1988 due to Hillel Slovak&#x27;s death via a heroin overdose. Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, and Jack Irons later formed the band Eleven. Jack Irons would later leave Eleven midway through the recording of their third album to join Pearl Jam (with whom he recorded two albums) only to later rejoin Eleven in time for their fifth album. Eleven disbanded after the death of Natasha Shneider. Both Johannes and Irons were later part of Spinnerette.

What Is This is song &quot;Mind My Have Still I&quot; from &quot;Squeezed&quot; was also featured on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;The Wild Life&quot;. Their second album, which featured a cover of The Spinners hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot;, was produced by Todd Rundgren, who also played Fairlight Synthesizer on the record. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot; was released as a single and video; it peaked at #62 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #69 on the Cashbox Top 100.

<text>Robert Ewell Sledge (born March 9, 1968) is an American musician, best known for his work with Ben Folds Five.

==Biography==
Robert Sledge began playing bass guitar at the age of eleven. His brother was playing guitar at his house so he also learned how to play the guitar at the same time. Before playing with Ben Folds Five he was bassist for bands Toxic Popsickle and Lexx Luthor (with Godsmack&#x27;s Sully Erna).

==Ben Folds Five==
Robert was a founding member of the piano-rock trio Ben Folds Five. Robert was the bass player for the group as well as taking up backup vocal duties on almost every song at the time. During the eponymous tour in support of their album The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner, Robert began to use several synthesizers on stage, as well as his typical electric &amp; acoustic basses. These would remain until the band&#x27;s break up in 2000.

Robert is known for his unique use of a Big Muff pedal, used to provide a layer of fuzz distortion on top of his typical bass tone. Sledge played a Hamer Blitz Bass throughout the early years of Ben Folds Five. It was used on their eponymous debut album. He later switched to a Fender Jazz Bass to record &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot;, while playing his Gibson and Epiphone Les Paul basses in live shows from that time to the present. Sledge had a sponsorship from Epiphone for his use of the Les Paul Bass, which can be seen in the Ben Folds Five performance on &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot;. He also plays an upright double bass for several songs, including &quot;Brick&quot;.

==Post-Ben Folds Five==
After Ben Folds Five broke up, Robert Sledge performed for one summer with the short-lived rock group Brother Seeker, a band composed of Robert and former Squirrel Nut Zippers members Tom Maxwell and Ken Mosher. According to John D. Luerssen&#x27;s &quot;Rivers&#x27; Edge: The Weezer Story&quot; Sledge was heavily considered to replace Mikey Welsh as the new Weezer bassist in 2001 but instead Scott Shriner took the job.

He later joined the band International Orange, as a songwriter, bassist and vocalist. International Orange broke up in 2005.

Robert currently lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he gives music lessons and plays in local rock bands &quot;Organ Failure&quot;, and &quot;Surrender Human.&quot; 

==Personal life==

<text>Infobot is a Perl IRC bot, first written in 1995 by Kevin Lenzo. The bot&#x27;s main goal was to remember URLs and associate them with a descriptive name, so whenever someone needed a specific URL they could ask the bot. For that reason, the first Infobot, running in #macintosh on the EFnet IRC network, had the nickname &#x27;url&#x27;.

Although the main project is now inactive, many forks from the original program were made, some of which are still active. Most of these forks carry extra features, such as googling a phrase given through the chat and saying the results of the query as messages directly in the chat.

== Operation ==
The Infobot works by a method of factoids. It stores information in its database by connecting a phrase with its definition, usually an informative short line. It records its information by constantly listening to the chat (which is configurable). It states its factoids when it recognizes a question in the chat. For example:

 &lt;someone&gt; wikipedia is http://www.wikipedia.org/

:&quot;The Infobot at this point silently remembers the statement.&quot;

 &lt;someone&gt; wikipedia?
 &lt;infobot&gt; somebody said wikipedia is http://www.wikipedia.org/

Because of its ability to store statements and re-state them with ease, many IRC channel operators use an Infobot to store information such as the channel rules so they could easily give them to newcomers to the channel.

Using its automated replies, Infobots are also often used as an entertainment bot, giving humorous replies to certain queries. For example, to prevent the Infobot from saying &#x27;X is Y&#x27;, the key word &#x27;&lt;REPLY&gt;&#x27; is used, to have this effect:

 &lt;someone&gt; dumb bot is &lt;REPLY&gt;stupid human
 &lt;someone&gt; infobot: what&#x27;s up?
 &lt;infobot&gt; huh?
 &lt;someone&gt; dumb bot
 &lt;infobot&gt; stupid human
== Derived bot projects ==
Infobots running the original Infobot code have become less popular on IRC now, mostly because of the inactivity of the original project. Newer Infobots have additional features. Most of them involve connecting to websites. For example, some bots have a &#x27;weather&#x27; module. So someone can ask the Infobot the weather at a certain address, and the Infobot will connect to a weather site and report the up-to-date weather on the chat. Infobots are also useful as calculators, and in currency conversions, word definitions, and many other things which one would otherwise have to open a site for.

A notable fork was blootbot by Tim Riker. In 2008 it was merged back with the original infobot. The resulting code is now maintained under the original infobot name by Riker. It uses an SQL back-end such as MySQL, PGSQL, or SQLite to store factoids.

<doc id="838415" wikidata="Q1052882" url="?curid=838415" title="Ideal type">
<text>Ideal type (), also known as pure type, is a typological term most closely associated with the sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920). For Weber, the conduct of social science depends upon the construction of abstract, hypothetical concepts. The &quot;ideal type&quot; is therefore a subjective element in social theory and research, and one of the subjective elements distinguishing sociology from natural science.

==Meaning==
An ideal type is formed from characteristics and elements of the given phenomena, but it is not meant to correspond to all of the characteristics of any one particular case. It is not meant to refer to perfect things, moral ideals nor to statistical averages but rather to stress certain elements common to most cases of the given phenomenon. In using the word &quot;ideal,&quot; Max Weber refers to the world of ideas (, &quot;mental images&quot;) and not to perfection; these &quot;ideal types&quot; are idea-constructs that help put the seeming chaos of social reality in order.

Weber wrote: &quot;An ideal type is formed by the one-sided accentuation of one or more points of view and by the synthesis of a great many diffuse, discrete, more or less present and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena, which are arranged according to those onesidedly emphasized viewpoints into a unified analytical construct...&quot; Therefore, ideal types are a form of perfect representation. It is a useful tool for comparative sociology in analyzing social or economic phenomena, having advantages over a very general, abstract idea and a specific historical example. It can be used to analyze both a general, suprahistorical phenomenon such as capitalism or historically unique occurrences such as in Weber&#x27;s &quot;Protestant Ethics&quot; analysis.

To try to understand a particular phenomenon, one must not only describe the actions of its participants but &quot;interpret&quot; them by classifying behavior as belonging to some prior &quot;ideal type.&quot; Weber described four &quot;ideal types&quot; of behavior: &quot;zweckrational&quot; (goal-rationality), &quot;wertrational&quot; (value-rationality), &quot;affektual&quot; (emotional-rationality), and &quot;traditional&quot; (custom, unconscious habit).

Weber states that an &quot;ideal type&quot; never seeks to claim its validity in terms of a reproduction of or correspondence with social reality. Its validity can be ascertained only in terms of adequacy, which is too conveniently ignored by the proponents of positivism. This does not mean, however, that objectivity, limited as it is, can be gained by &quot;weighing the various evaluations against one another and making a &#x27;statesman-like&#x27; compromise among them&quot;, which is often proposed as a solution by those propounding methodological perspectivism. Such a practice, which Weber calls &quot;syncretism&quot;, is not only impossible but also unethical, for it avoids &quot;the practical duty to stand up for our own ideals&quot; [Weber 1904/1949, p. 58].

==Scholarly reception==
It is commonly argued that idealization plays a key role in the methodology of other social sciences, especially of economics.

For example, homo economicus is the result of a consistent abstraction-idealization process. One of the fundamental axioms of neoclassical economics, the law of diminishing marginal utility, followed from the highlighting of Weber-Fechner&#x27;s law in psychophysics, which highlights that the growth of subjectively perceived intensity of recurrent stimuli with the same physical intensity is always decreasing. The same law emerges in the law of diminishing marginal returns. Homo economicus as presupposed by Neoclassicals is an idealized, abstract creature that can be characterized by an intention to exchange and whose only task is to take economic decisions. For homo economicus, there is no time or social and natural environment, he is ageless, he has no whims, and his decisions are not biased by occasional effects from the (social) environment. So, his behaviour only reflects the objective and consistently prevailing economic laws established by formal rationality. After all, human (and social) sciences, similarly to natural sciences, i.e. abstracting from everything subjective, constrained themselves to phrase only objective truths.

However, the conceptualizing routine of neoclassical economics differs from the genuine approach of Max Weber in that Neoclassicals focused exactly on finding and deducing economic laws (in accordance with the efforts of natural sciences), while the ideal-types of the Weberian sociology only supported the interpretative understanding of past events with no references to causal laws. Even if the method and the strategy of creating ideal-typical concepts are common, these are two opposing scientific programs eventually. Weber offers an excellent description and a user&#x27;s guide to the technique of abstraction and idealization that also directly applies to the conceptualizing strategy of mainstream economics that is on a completely different track with its law-seeking efforts.

==Criticism==
Critics of ideal type include proponents of the normal type theory. Some sociologists argue that ideal type tends to focus on extreme phenomena and overlook the connections between them, and that it is difficult to show how the types and their elements fit into a theory of a total social system.

<text>Ian McFarlane (born 1959) is an Australian music journalist, music historian and author, whose best known publication is the &quot;Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop&quot; (1999), which was updated for a second edition in 2017.

As a journalist he started in 1984 with &quot;Juke&quot;, a rock music newspaper. During the early 1990s he worked for Roadrunner Records while he published a music guide, &quot;The Australian New Music Record Guide Volume 1: 1976–1980&quot; (1992). He followed with two fanzines, &quot;Freedom Train&quot; and &quot;Prehistoric Sounds&quot;, both issued during 1994 to 1996. McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop&quot; is described by the &quot;Australian Music Guide&quot; as &quot;the most exhaustive and wide-ranging encyclopedia of Australian music from the 1950s onwards&quot;. Subsequently, he was a writer for &quot;The Australian&quot; and worked for Raven Records, a reissue specialist label, preparing compilations, writing liner notes and providing research. He fulfilled a similar role at Aztec Music from 2004 to March 2012. From July 2013 he has been a contributor to &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot;, writing a column.

==Biography==

Ian McFarlane was born in 1959, and started as a freelance music journalist in 1984 writing for Melbourne-based newspaper, &quot;Juke&quot;, &quot;The Edge&quot; and &quot;From the Vault&quot;. During the late 1980s to early 1990s he was a writer with Sydney music magazine &quot;Hot Metal&quot; and during 1992 to 1994 worked for Roadrunner Records (Australia). In 1992 MacFarlane published his first music guide, &quot;The Australian New Music Record Guide Volume 1: 1976–1980&quot;, which provided a chronological list and brief description of all independent records released by Australian bands in Australia, together with a year-by-year summary of how local independent music developed during that time. This series however did not progress beyond Volume 1, although he did commence &quot;Volume 2 – 1981–1983&quot;, which was intended to be published at the end of 1994.

In 1994 he wrote and edited the fanzine, &quot;Freedom Train&quot;, published by Third Stone Press, which covered Australian progressive rock between the 1970s and the 1990s. Issue 1 of &quot;Freedom Train&quot; comprised a series of articles, interviews and discographies of bands, including Spectrum, Ariel, Madder Lake, The Masters Apprentices and Kahvas Jute. Issue 2 covered bands and musicians including Chain, Phil Manning, Taman Shud, Sebastian Hardie, Healing Force and Galadriel. At the same time he also wrote and edited &quot;Prehistoric Sounds&quot;, published by Dark City Press, which dealt with Australian indie rock from the 1970s and 1980s. Issue 1 contained articles on The Saints, Models, The Psycho-Surgeons, The Lipstick Killers, The Thought Criminals and Au-Go-Go Records, together with interviews with Ed Kuepper, Sean Kelly and Mark Taylor. Issue 2 included articles on The Scientists, The Birthday Party, Citadel Records and The Laughing Clowns and interviews with Kim Salmon, Rowland S. Howard and Kuepper. Issue 3 had articles on Radio Birdman, The Visitors, New Race, Deniz Tek, New Christs, Fun Things and The Hitmen, as well as interviews with Rob Younger and Brad Shepherd. Issue 4, which was also the final issue, contained articles on Beasts of Bourbon, Died Pretty, The Moodists and Greasy Pop Records, as well as interviews with Tex Perkins, Brett Myers, Ron Peno, Dave Graney and Clare Moore.

McFarlane wrote &quot;The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop&quot; in December 1999. His &quot;magnum opus&quot; is described by the &quot;Australian Music Guide&quot; as &quot;the most exhaustive and wide-ranging encyclopedia of Australian music from the 1950s onwards&quot;. Fellow music journalist, Debbie Kruger, describes it as &quot;brilliantly researched, unfailingly thorough, never boring. Essential&quot;.

From the late 1990s he was a writer for &quot;The Australian&quot;. He worked for Raven Records, a reissue specialist label, preparing compilations, writing liner notes and providing research. He wrote most of the liner notes for Aztec Music releases from its establishment in 2004 to its closure in March 2012. McFarlane detailed the importance of Aztec Music&#x27;s reissues after decades of recovery from a mid-1970s punk-inspired backlash &quot;those punk bands came in and said &#x27;Anything pre-1976 is crap&#x27; ... That carried over well into the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s&#x27; ... It took a long time for people to get over that post-&#x27;76 thing of &#x27;No, we don&#x27;t care about our heritage&#x27;&quot;.

In June 2008 &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper commemorated 50 years of Australian rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll (the anniversary of the release of Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &quot;Wild One&quot;) by selecting the Top 50 Australian Albums, with McFarlane selected as one of the industry judges. From July 2013 he has been a contributor to &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot;, writing a column. McFarlane updated his encyclopaedia for a second edition in 2017. &quot;&#x27;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s Steven Carroll observed, &quot;It&#x27;s so easy to get lost in this revised edition: one band leading to another, and so on, until you&#x27;re suddenly asking yourself what happened to the last hour.&quot;

<text>The United States Senate Special Committee on Aging is a special committee in the United States Senate established on 1961. It was initially established as a temporary committee. It became a permanent Senate committee in 1977. As a special committee, it has no legislative authority, but it studies issues related to older Americans, particularly Medicare and Social Security.

Prior to the passage of Medicare, the committee was studying health care insurance coverage for elderly American citizens. The committee conducts oversight of the Medicare program, Social Security and the Older Americans Act. Some of the issues that have been examined by the committee include unacceptable conditions in nursing homes, protection from age discrimination, and pricing practices for prescription drugs.

<doc id="838426" wikidata="Q4548682" url="?curid=838426" title="12 Arnold Grove">
<text>12 Arnold Grove is the birthplace and early childhood home of former Beatle George Harrison. Located in Wavertree, Liverpool, near Picton Clock Tower, it is a small terraced house in a cul-de-sac, with a small alley to the rear. Harrison&#x27;s parents, Harold and Louise, moved to the house in 1931 following their marriage. The rent was ten shillings a week. Here their four children were born: Louise (16 August 1931 – 29 January 2023), Harry (20 July 1934-), Peter (20 July 1940 – 1 June 2007) and George (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001).

Harrison lived in the property for seven years, by the end of which his family had been living there for nearly 20 years. They finally moved out to 25 Upton Green in the Speke district of Liverpool in 1950. His eldest brother Harry recalled: &quot;Our little house was just two rooms up and two rooms down, but, except for a short period when our father was away at sea, we always knew the comfort and security of a very close-knit home life.&quot;

Harrison recalled that the only heating was a single coal fire, and the house was so cold in winter that he and his brothers dreaded getting up in the morning because it was freezing cold and they had to use the outside toilet. The house had tiny rooms – only ten feet by ten (100 ft2, about 9 m2) – and a small iron cooking stove in the back room, which was used as a kitchen. Describing the back garden, Harrison wrote it had &quot;a one-foot wide flowerbed, a toilet, a dustbin fitted to the back wall (and) a little hen house where we kept cockerels.&quot;

Harrison once said of the house, &quot;Try and imagine the soul entering the womb of a woman living at 12 Arnold Grove, Wavertree, Liverpool 15. There were all the barrage balloons, and the Germans bombing Liverpool. All that was going on. I sat outside the house a couple of years ago, imagining 1943, nipping through the spiritual world, the astral level, getting back into a body in that house. That really is strange when you consider the whole planet, all the planets there may be on a spiritual level. How do I come into that family, in that house at that time, and who am I anyway?&quot;

In February 2024, it was announced that the home would receive a blue plaque, one of the first located outside of London. On May 24, 2024, the blue plaque was added.

<doc id="838434" wikidata="Q371979" url="?curid=838434" title="Pierre Puget">
<text>Pierre Paul Puget (16 October 1620 (or 31 October 1622) – 2 December 1694) was a French Baroque painter, sculptor, architect and engineer. His sculpture expressed emotion, pathos and drama, setting it apart from the more classical and academic sculpture of the Style Louis XIV.

==Biography==
Puget was born at the home of his father, a stone mason, in the working-class neighborhood of Panier, in Marseille. As his two older brothers were trained as stone masons, he was trained as a woodcarver. He began his career at the age of fourteen, carving the elaborate wooden ornament of the galleys built in the Marseille shipyards. He also showed talent as a painter.

===Italy===
In 1640, taking his tools with him, he departed Marseille by sea to Livorno, Italy and then to Florence in search of an atelier which would employ him as a carver or painter. He carved some decorative panels in Florence, and then, with a good recommendation from his employer, and samples of his paintings, he went to Rome and presented himself to the painter Pietro da Cortona, one of the early masters of the Baroque style. He assisted Da Cortona in painting of the lavish ceilings of the Palazzo Barberini in Rome and the Palazzo Pitti at Florence.

===Marseille and Toulon===
After three years with da Cortona in Rome, he returned to Marseille, bringing with him the decorative tastes of the Italian Baroque. In Livorno, he had made drawings of the highly-ornamented baroque decoration of Tuscan galleys and warships, as well as designs of imaginary ships painted by Cortona for his ceilings. He showed these to Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé, Grand Admiral of the French fleet, and was given a commission to design a carved medallion for the stern of a new French warship, named for the Queen, Anne of Austria.

The death of the Grand Admiral in 1646 ended his first work in naval decoration. He began painting, mostly religious works, in the style of Annibale Carracci and Rubens. He also received a commission in 1649 to make several public fountains for new squares in Toulon. In 1652 he was commissioned to make baptismal fonts for the Marseille cathedral. From 1662 to 1665, he made a series of paintings for the Cathedral of Marseille.

He was recognized as a painter but still poorly paid; In 1653, he was commissioned by the Brotherhood of Corpus Domini to make two large paintings, &quot;The Baptism of Clovis&quot; and &quot;the Baptism of Constantine&quot; (now in the Marseille Museum of Art), for a total of one hundred forty &quot;livres&quot;, a very small amount for the time and amount of the work. He completed another religious painting, &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot;, in December 1655. Altogether he is recorded as having painted fifty-six paintings, of which nineteen were documented in 1868 as still existing. A serious illness in 1665 and advice of doctors caused him to abandon painting entirely.

In 1650, he was living in Toulon, and was married there. He turned his attention entirely to sculpture. In 1655, he received his first important commission for the sculptural decoration of the entrance of the Hôtel de Ville in Toulon; he produced a porch supported by muscular atlantes, still in existence on a new municipal building facing the port. He used as his models two of the muscular workers who unloaded ships along the quay in front of the building. Their faces and postures in the sculpture vividly expressed their struggle with the weight on their shoulders. The work was finished in 1657. He was paid fifteen hundred &quot;livres&quot;, to which the city authorities, pleased with the work, added a supplement of two hundred &quot;livres&quot;. His work was widely praised, and terra-cotta copies were made and circulated. Puget was converted from a modestly-talented painter to a celebrated sculptor.

===Vaux-le-Vicomte and Genoa===
His reputation spread beyond Provence; he was invited to Paris and received a commission from a nobleman named Girardin for two statues, one representing Hercules and the other the Earth and Janus, for a chateau in Normandy. He completed them in Paris in July 1660. He then received an even more important commission from Nicolas Fouquet, the King&#x27;s Minister of Finance, to make sculpture for Fouquet&#x27;s new garden at Vaux-le-Vicomte, including a statue of Hercules, the personal symbol of Fouquet. These statues were to be made of marble, which was very expensive and rarely used in Paris at the time. Fouquet sent Puget to Genoa, in Italy, to personally select and bring back the blocks of the best marble While he was preparing his voyage, he received several proposals for sculptural projects from Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the secretary to Cardinal Mazarin, the prime minister, but he refused them, due to his obligations to Fouquet. Colbert did not forget this slight.

In 1660 Fouquet travelled to the quarries of Carrara marble, where he selected the marble he wanted, chose a Genoese sailor as the model, and in Genoa made the statue that became known as the &quot;Hercules of Gaul&quot;. However, on 5 September 1661, Fouquet was arrested and imprisoned, on the accusations of Colbert, for taking government funds for his own use. The statue commissioned for Fouquet&#x27;s garden was later sent instead to the Château de Sceaux, Colbert&#x27;s more modest residence. It is now in the Louvre.

Puget decided to stay for a time in Italy, making long visits to Rome and Genoa. His principal patron in Italy was an Italian nobleman, Francesco Maria Sauli. His major works during this period were two monumental statues for the pillars of the church of Santa Maria di Carignano, representing Saint Sebastian and Bishop Alexander Paoli. They were completed in 1663, and showed the influence of Bernini. He also made a notable statue, &quot;The Immaculate Conception&quot;, for the French patron Emmanuel Brignole, for the chapel of an Albergo in Genoa. The Genoese senate proposed that he paint their council chamber, but he declined, to devote all his attention to sculpture.
===Toulon and Marseille - naval architecture===
He returned to France in 1669 and divided his time between Toulon and Marseille. He was offered the position chief of decoration for French warships, but before accepting he sent a list of his demands to Colbert; among others, he insisted on being considered an officer, not a worker; and to have final authority for designs, over that of the King&#x27;s official artists, the painter Charles Le Brun and the royal sculptor François Girardon. This was entirely unacceptable to Colbert. Colbert gave Girardon, not Puget, the commission to decorate the &quot;Royal Louis&quot;, the major new warship of the French fleet. The French fleet needed new ships, and Puget was charged with decorating, ten new men-of-war, as well as designing elegant new building for the headquarters of the fleet.

Puget continued to work on other sculptural and artistic projects in Toulon, He sculpted a large marble group of the Virgin and Child for the church of Lorgues and created a monumental wooden retable still in place, for Toulon Cathedral. In addition, he designed town houses in Aix-en-Provence and several municipal buildings in Marseille, including the fish market (still in place) and the La Vieille Charité, originally a home for beggars and the indigent, now a cultural center.

Puget&#x27;s view of naval architecture soon clashed with the views of the new Commissioner of Fortifications, the Chevalier de Clairville. Clairville changed all of the Puget&#x27;s plans, removed decoration he considered unnecessary, and rejected his elegant new headquarters building. Puget appealed to Colbert, but Colbert sided with Clairville. At the end of 1669, Puget took a leave of absence and departed the dockyards for his traditional sanctuary, Genoa, where he made a series of works, including &quot;The Virgin&quot; (1670), now in the oratory of the Church of Saint Philippe de Néri.

When he returned to the dockyards in June 1670, he found they were commanded by a new officer, and that the decoration of ships he had begun had been given to others. He also learned that, upon the instructions of Colbert, any work he did had to be approved at higher levels by Le Brun and the senior sculptors in Paris. He was to design only what he was told to design. Furthermore, Colbert presented a new argument; British ships had little or no sculptural decoration, and they usually won battles. Therefore French ships should also be without sculpture.
===Marseille, architecture and urban design===
In 1672, having no further work at the Naval Arsenal, Puget returned to his birthplace, Marseille. His first project was a new urban square and street, the Cours Saint-Louis, and rue Canabière. It took much of its inspiration from the urban planning and architecture of Genoa, and resembled on a small scale the later urban projects of Baron Haussmann and Napoleon III in Paris. He also created an ornate sculptural plaque with the coat of arms of the King to decorate the facade of the Hôtel de Ville. He designed a new fish market, completed in 1672, which is still in use, and La Vieille Charité, begun in 1679, originally a home for beggars and the indigent, now a cultural center. In addition, he designed town houses in Aix-en-Provence, including the Hotel d&#x27;Aiguilles (1675), a baroque mansion.

===Versailles - Milon of Croton===
Puget had still not broken into the exclusive group of sculptors who were receiving royal commissions for the statuary of the new gardens of Versailles. He still possessed several blocks of fine marble from Genoa, In 1671 he sent to Colbert designs for two large-scale statues, &quot;Milon of Croton&quot; (now in the Louvre) and the bas-relief &quot;Alexander and Diogenes&quot; (1685, now in the Louvre). Colbert disliked Puget&#x27;s personality but admired his skill; on 13 May 1672, he offered Puget a commission to make the two statues. Puget was occupied with his tasks for the city of Marseille, and did not begin work until 1672. The impatient Colbert wrote to Puget, demanding a report on the statue, and observing that the marble belonged not to Puget, but to the royal government. Puget worked furiously on Milon. However, in 1681, six years after sending the designs, the statue was still not finished; it was finally completed in August, 1682.

Puget&#x27;s Milon of Croton (1682) is a monumental work, nearly three meters high, is one of his most dramatic and expressive works. Illustrating a story by Ovid, it depicts the moment when Milon de Croton, a celebrated warrior but now elderly and weak, is attacked by a lion. His expression at the moment the lion claws Milon&#x27;s is distorted by pain, and is full of pathos. This work was satisfactory to Colbert, was purchased by the royal government, and given a prominent place in the Gardens of Versailles. Puget, in the meantime, had begun on another monumental statue for Versailles, of Andromeda.

Colbert died the following year and was replaced by as superintendent of royal buildings by François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois. A month after Colbert&#x27;s death, Louvois wrote to Puget for a report on other works that Puget was making, and asking how old he was. Puget responded that he was sixty years old and that he was working with great enthusiasm on his monumental statue of Perseus Andromeda (completed 1684, now in the Louvre) and the bas-relief &quot;Alexander and Diogenes&quot; (completed 1685, the Louvre). &quot;I was raised making great works...&quot; Puget wrote to Louvois, &quot;The marble trembles before me, no matter how large it is.&quot; The two works were completed, loaded on ships in Toulon, and were placed in the gardens of Versailles.
===Marseille and the Louis XIV statue===
In 1665, he proposed an even more ambitious commission, to design a new city square next to the port of Marseille, with, as the centerpiece, a monumental equestrian statue of Louis XIV, facing the harbor. Similar monuments had been constructed in Paris, in Place Vendôme and Place des Victoires. He designed both the statue and the architecture of the square, which was actually an oval, surrounded by a majestic marble colonnade, to complement the statue. The only question was money; the royal government expected the city of Marseille to finance the project.

Puget made one of his rare trips to Versailles to promote the project in person to the King, on 29 November 1687. The King expressed his admiration of the project, as did his consort, Madame de Maintenon; but the soon-to-be chief royal architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart, pointed out that it would be more attractive and efficient to build a square, rather than an oval, and a more modest project. Mansart himself had designed both Place Vendome and Place des Victoires, and his views were accepted by the King, much to the distress and anger of Puget. Work went ahead on the project, following the new plan. The marble was delivered for the statue, and Puget&#x27;s friends in Genoa sent a magnificent horse to serve as a model. Puget remained adamant and declared he would not make the statue until the city square, in an oval shape, was constructed for it. The &quot;Echevins&quot;, or city council, decided they preferred the simpler and less expensive square design, but Puget was adamant.
Puget made another trip to Versailles to try to persuade the King to accept his project, but the King declined to see him. The Echevins of Marseille abandoned Puget and selected a different and little-known sculptor, Clérion, and Puget was excluded from the project. In the end, neither the square nor the statue was made; the outbreak of a war with Holland in 1688 ended for a time any new architectural projects.

The last two works of Puget were the bas-reliefs &quot;Alexander and Diogenes&quot; and &quot;The Plague of Marseille&quot;. The last work, depicting a tragic but heroic moment in the city&#x27;s history, was left unfinished. After his death, it was placed in the Council Chamber of the city of Marseille, where he died in 1694.

In 1882, Adolphe-André Porée discovered a lost statue by Puget on a castle grounds at Biéville-Beuville. He sculpted a large marble group of the Virgin and Child for the church of Lorgues and created a monumental wooden retable still in place, for Toulon Cathedral. &quot;Hydra of Lerna&quot; was originally in the castle of Vaudreuil, and is now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.

Mont Puget, near Marseille, is named after him.

==Death==
Puget died in Marseille on 2 December 1694, at the age of seventy-four. He was buried in the cemetery of the church of the Convent of the Observance. The church and the cemetery have disappeared, and there is no marker to show where his remains are buried.

<text>Werner Baumbach (27 December 1916 – 20 October 1953) was a German bomber pilot during World War II. He commanded the secret bomber wing Kampfgeschwader 200 (KG 200) of the Luftwaffe, the air force of Nazi Germany. Baumbach received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for the destruction of over of Allied shipping.

==Career==
Baumbach entered the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in 1936 and, after initial training at the 2nd Air Warfare School (Fliegerhorst Gatow), was trained as a bomber pilot. He was one of the first pilots to fly the Junkers Ju 88 bomber and flew various bombing missions with Kampfgeschwader 30 (KG 30). On 19 April 1940, he bombed and damaged the French cruiser &quot;Émile Bertin&quot; for which he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.

In 1942, Baumbach was removed from active pilot duty and started working on new bomber designs; among others, he helped design the composite bomber system, &quot;Mistel&quot;. In 1944, he was placed in command of the newly formed Kampfgeschwader 200 (KG 200) and was in charge of all &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; special missions. Baumbach was promoted to &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; on 15 November 1944 and was the acting &quot;General der Kampfflieger&quot; for two months.

On the last stage on the war, during the days of the Flensburg Government, Baumbach was placed in charge of the government air squadron.

After the war, Baumbach spent three years as a prisoner of war before he moved to Argentina where he worked as a test pilot. He died in a plane crash on 20 October 1953 near Berazategui, while evaluating a British Lancaster bomber for the Argentine Air Force. He was interred in his hometown, Cloppenburg, Lower Saxony. The street &quot;Werner-Baumbach-Straße&quot; in Cloppenburg was named after him.

In 1949 he published &quot;Zu spät? Aufstieg und Untergang der deutschen Luftwaffe&quot;, which was translated into English as &quot;Broken Swastika: The Defeat of the Luftwaffe&quot; in 1960.

<doc id="838440" wikidata="Q707915" url="?curid=838440" title="Billy Kidman">
<text>Peter Alan Gruner Jr.(born May 11, 1974) is an American retired professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Billy Kidman. He works for WWE, where he is as a producer.

As a wrestler, Kidman is best known for his work with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (WWF/E) throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. While in WCW, Kidman gained fame as a key member of several stables. In addition to being a member of Raven&#x27;s Flock, he also was a member of The Filthy Animals and later The New Blood. As a member of these stables, Kidman participated in memorable feuds with top WCW names, including Hulk Hogan, Jeff Jarrett, and Rey Mysterio Kidman also found championship success while in WCW, where he became a three time Cruiserweight Champion, a two time World Tag Team Champion, once with Mysterio Jr. and once with Konnan, and in the Cruiserweight Tag Team Champion final with Mysterio Jr.

Upon WCW&#x27;s purchase by the World Wrestling Federation, Kidman became a member of the WCW/ECW Alliance. During his time in the WWF (later renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment), Kidman once again found success upon winning the Cruiserweight Championship an additional four times while the title was under the WCW banner and later the WWF/E banner, in addition to winning WWE&#x27;s Tag Team Championship once with Paul London.

==Early life and education==
Gruner grew up in Allentown, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Parkland High School. Gruner was a banker before he started training to be a professional wrestler and was good friends with fellow professional wrestler Chris Kanyon, who he met at the Wild Samoan training center in Pennsylvania. He is a cousin of fellow professional wrestler Mikey Batts.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1994–1996)===

Gruner was trained by Afa Anoaʻi, one half of The Wild Samoans, and wrestled his first match on September 11, 1994 in Hellertown, Pennsylvania against &quot;Wild Thing&quot; Dan Kallis on the independent circuit as Kid Flash. He formed a tag team with Ace Darling known as The Shooting Stars, and they would find success by winning the ECWA Tag Team Championship.

===World Championship Wrestling===
====The Flock (1996–1998)====

Gruner started wrestling for World Championship Wrestling on March 6, 1996 as &quot;Kid Flash&quot; against Chris Kanyon in a losing effort. Gruner then competed as Billy Cannon on April 10, before settling on the name Billy Kidman on May 13. He made his televised debut in WCW on the May 18 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, competing against Diamond Dallas Page in a losing effort. He mainly competed as an enhancement talent for over a year with no character. His first televised win occurred on the July 28 episode of &quot;WorldWide&quot; against Psychosis. Kidman received his first title opportunity in WCW, unsuccessfully challenging Rey Misterio Jr. for the World Cruiserweight Championship on the September 9 episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;.

On the September 30 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Kidman filled in for Psychosis, who could not show up due to his visa issues and competed as the masked &quot;El Technico&quot; by teaming with Juventud Guerrera against The Public Enemy in a losing effort. Kidman would receive two more title shots for the World Cruiserweight Championship, this time against Dean Malenko on the December 2 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; and the December 14 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; but lost both times.

On the October 13, 1997 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Kidman was added to Raven&#x27;s Flock. To fit in with the Flock&#x27;s gimmick of being outcasts, Kidman was given the gimmick of a heroin addict, where he constantly scratched his arms and named his shooting star press, the &quot;Seven Year Itch&quot;. Kidman found little personal success with the group and competed in major matches only on a few occasions, such as participating in a battle royal to determine the #1 contender for the Cruiserweight Championship in his pay-per-view debut at Slamboree. Kidman would then lose to Juventud Guerrera at Bash at the Beach. At Fall Brawl, Kidman aided Perry Saturn in defeating Flock&#x27;s leader Raven in a match, thus disbanding the group.

==== Cruiserweight Champion (1998–1999) ====
Following the Flock&#x27;s disbanding, Kidman shed his grungy attire and heroin gimmick and began performing as a clean-cut fan favorite before eventually defeating Juventud Guerrera to win his first Cruiserweight Championship on the September 14 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Kidman retained the title against various cruiserweights on a weekly basis, with his first pay-per-view title defense occurring against Disco Inferno at Halloween Havoc, where Kidman retained. Kidman lost the title back to Guerrera on the November 16 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; but regained it in a rematch at World War 3 in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Shortly after, Kidman joined Rey Mysterio, Jr. in the latter&#x27;s rivalry with the Latino World Order. At Starrcade, Kidman successfully defended the Cruiserweight Championship against Guerrera and Mysterio in a triangle match. LWO leader Eddie Guerrero challenged Kidman to an immediate title match afterwards, which Kidman accepted. Kidman retained the title after assistance by Mysterio.

Kidman&#x27;s title reign continued into 1999 with a successful title defense against Guerrera, Psychosis and Mysterio in a four-way match at Souled Out. Kidman then retained the title against various challengers such as Chavo Guerrero Jr. at SuperBrawl IX and Mikey Whipwreck at Uncensored, before losing the title to Mysterio on the March 15 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Following this, Mysterio asked Kidman to be his tag team partner in a match for the World Tag Team Championship. Kidman at first declined, as a previous attempt at a tag team between the two did not reach any level of success. The two, however, faced Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko for the titles on the March 29 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, and succeeded with unwanted aid from Raven and Saturn. Kidman then faced off against Mysterio in an attempt to win back the Cruiserweight Championship at Spring Stampede, however, Mysterio retained his title.

The three teams feuded for several weeks, which ended in a three-way tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree. Chris Kanyon&#x27;s interference led to the victory for Raven and Saturn. Kidman spent the next several months in assorted feuds.

==== Filthy Animals (1999–2001) ====

In the summer of 1999, Kidman joined Filthy Animals alongside Rey Mysterio, Konnan, and Eddie Guerrero. Initially joining together to combat Dead Pool, Filthy Animals defeated the Dead Pool twice at Road Wild and Fall Brawl. Kidman would then become responsible for unmasking Psychosis by defeating him in a hair vs. mask match on the September 27 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. At Halloween Havoc, Kidman substituted for an injured Mysterio and teamed with Konnan to defend the World Tag Team Championship against Harlem Heat and The First Family in a triangle match, which Harlem Heat won. However, the following night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Kidman and Konnan defeated Harlem Heat to win the titles, beginning Kidman&#x27;s second tag team title win in WCW.

Kidman then participated in a tournament for the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship, defeating Konnan in the first round and Norman Smiley in a hardcore match in the second round before losing to eventual winner Bret Hart in the quarter-final round. Filthy Animals then lost an intergender elimination match to The Revolution at Mayhem. The following night, on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Kidman teamed with Konnan&#x27;s substitute Rey Mysterio to defend the World Tag Team Championship against Creative Control. Filthy Animals went on to lose the titles. Kidman would challenge Jeff Jarrett for the United States Heavyweight Championship on the December 27 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. He came close to winning the title but ended up losing the match.

Filthy Animals began to crumble in 2000 when Guerrero left WCW, and Kidman left the stable when the rest of its members turned heel. At Souled Out, Kidman participated in the Triple Threat Theater, a series of three matches with different stipulations, initially scheduled between Chris Benoit and Jeff Jarrett. However, Jarrett was unable to compete due to his injury. Kidman won the first two matches, a Catch-as-Catch Can match against Dean Malenko, and a Bunkhouse Brawl against Perry Saturn, but lost the third match, a Caged Heat match against The Wall. This resulted in Kidman feuding with Wall and Vampiro over the next few weeks, culminating with Kidman defeating Vampiro in a match at SuperBrawl 2000. Following that, Kidman joined forces with Booker to feud with Harlem Heat 2000, defeating them at Uncensored. On March 30, Kidman defeated The Artist at a house show to win his third Cruiserweight Championship, but lost the title back to Artist a day later.

In April, Kidman joined Vince Russo&#x27;s New Blood stable, signalling another heel turn. At Spring Stampede, Kidman participated in a tournament for the vacant United States Heavyweight Championship, losing to Vampiro in the quarter-final round. Reflecting the gimmick of the New Blood, Kidman began acting as hotshot who refused to be held back by wrestlers beyond their prime. This led to the biggest feud of his career with Hulk Hogan, including a pinfall victory over Hogan in a handicap match. However, the rivalry concluded with back-to-back matches for Kidman against Hogan at Slamboree and The Great American Bash. The New Blood would then split up, leading Kidman to turn face as he entered a feud with Shane Douglas for the affection of his on-screen girlfriend Torrie Wilson. During the feud, Wilson turned on Kidman. Kidman was legitimately injured in a strap match at New Blood Rising, when Douglas hung Kidman from the neck using the strap. Despite winning the match, Kidman was forced to take several weeks off to recover. At Fall Brawl, Kidman and Madusa lost to Douglas and Wilson in a scaffold match.

Following the feud, Kidman began teaming with Mysterio Jr. again, thus joining Filthy Animals once again. At Halloween Havoc, Kidman and Mysterio failed to win the World Tag Team Championship from Mark Jindrak and Sean O&#x27;Haire in a triangle match, also involving The Boogie Knights. The duo then began feuding with KroniK after losing to them at Millennium Final. At Mayhem, Filthy Animals defeated Alex Wright and KroniK in a handicap match after KroniK abandoned Wright. Filthy Animals&#x27; next rivalry was against Jeff Jarrett and The Harris Brothers, losing to them in a street fight at Starrcade. They were also on the losing end against Team Canada in a penalty box match at Sin.

In the spring of 2001, Kidman and Mysterio entered the Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship tournament, defeating Jason Lee and Johnny Swinger in the quarterfinals and 3 Count in the semifinals but lost in the finals to Elix Skipper and Kid Romeo at Greed. On the final episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Kidman and Mysterio Jr. won the titles from Skipper and Romeo. That night, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) purchased WCW and Kidman&#x27;s contract was picked up by the WWF. As a result, Kidman and Mysterio ended up as the final Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions in WCW history.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment===
====Cruiserweight Championship pursuit (2001–2003)====
When the WWF purchased WCW, the contract of Gruner (who was still wrestling as Billy Kidman) was one of twenty-five involved in the purchase. When The Invasion commenced, Gruner appeared on WWF television under his Billy Kidman ring name as a tweener for The Alliance. Kidman debuted in WWF on the July 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, competing in the first televised WCW match on the weekly program. Kidman defeated Gregory Helms to win the WCW Cruiserweight Championship in his WWF debut. As the WCW Cruiserweight Champion, Kidman proceeded to defeat the WWF Light Heavyweight Champion X-Pac at Invasion. On the July 30 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Kidman lost the Cruiserweight Championship to X-Pac in a title versus title match, with X-Pac&#x27;s Light Heavyweight Championship also on the line. After this, Kidman was later sidelined with an injury during the Invasion angle and thus did not have as big of an impact as other WCW wrestlers.

After recovering from his injury, Kidman returned to WWF in October. On the October 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kidman defeated X-Pac to win his record-tying fifth Cruiserweight Championship. He lost the title to Tajiri on the October 22 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. At Survivor Series, Kidman participated in the Immunity battle royal, where the winner would receive immunity from being fired. Kidman failed to win the match, and Alliance lost later that night, thus being forced to disband. As a result, all Alliance members were fired in storyline, and Kidman was taken off television, competing at house shows for the next four months.

Kidman returned to WWF television after being drafted to the SmackDown! brand as part of the brand extension on March 25, 2002. Kidman&#x27;s return match took place on the March 30 episode of &quot;Jakked&quot;, where he teamed with The Hurricane against Funaki and Tajiri in a losing effort. On the April 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kidman defeated Tajiri to win his record-breaking sixth Cruiserweight Championship. However, Tajiri reclaimed the title at Backlash. Kidman continued to feud with Tajiri over the title, wrestling him on various occasions but failed to regain the title. After losing in a #1 contender&#x27;s match to Jamie Noble on the June 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kidman began feuding with Noble over the title, unsuccessfully challenging him at Vengeance.

At Rebellion, Kidman and his real-life girlfriend Torrie Wilson defeated John Cena and Dawn Marie in an intergender tag team match. After this, he went on to win his record-breaking seventh Cruiserweight Championship after defeating Jamie Noble at Survivor Series. He later lost the title three months later to Matt Hardy at No Way Out.

====Teaming and feuding with Paul London (2004–2005)====

Following the title loss, Kidman proceeded to spend the next few years as a cornerstone of the cruiserweight division before forming a tag team with newcomer Paul London in early 2004. Together, they slowly worked their way up the tag team ranks before ultimately winning the WWE Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz on the July 8, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Proving the win was not an upset, they went on to defeat the Dudley Boyz in a rematch for the title.

Their championship run came to an abrupt end after Kidman turned his back on London. The heel turn played off of a legitimate injury which occurred on the August 26, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when Kidman&#x27;s shooting star press unintentionally caused Chavo Guerrero to suffer a concussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;injury/aftermath&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The next week, Kidman was on the top rope ready to hit the shooting star press, but hesitated, climbed down the turnbuckles, and slowly walked backstage overwhelmed with guilt after injuring Guerrero. London was left alone to defend the title against Kenzo Suzuki and René Duprée, and was easily defeated. As a result, London and Kidman faced each other at No Mercy, where Kidman defeated London before performing the shooting star press on London while he was strapped to a stretcher. This completed Kidman&#x27;s heel turn, as he proceeded to blame the fans for wanting him to be more brutal with his in-ring style. Kidman and Guerrero ended their feud upon Chavo&#x27;s return, the latter being victorious in the final match. Kidman then competed against London over the Cruiserweight Championship in the coming months. At the start of 2005, Kidman suffered a broken orbital bone, which sidelined him for three months.

Gruner was released from his WWE contract on July 6, 2005. Gruner stated that the release was due to an argument with management over their decision to stop booking wrestlers on first class flights overseas.

===Independent circuit (2005–2007)===
Following his departure from WWE, Kidman began touring the United Kingdom. During the tour, he competed for the Frontier Wrestling Alliance in a three-way match with Jody Fleisch and Jonny Storm. He also wrestled British wrestling legend Robbie Brookside in a losing effort to determine the inaugural Real Quality Wrestling Heavyweight Champion.

In 2007, Kidman made his International Wrestling Association debut in a match for the IWA World Heavyweight Championship against Ray González, which he lost. Kidman also took part in the East Coast Australian International Assault II Tour from June 1–3, 2007, where he competed against Australian wrestlers TNT and Mark Hilton before defeating Bryan Danielson to win the WSW World Heavyweight Championship on the third night in Newcastle.

On July 8, 2007, Kidman teamed up with Sean Waltman as part of a triple threat match in McAllen, Texas to crown the new NWA World Tag Team Champions. The title was previously vacated by Team 3D after Total Nonstop Action Wrestling officially pulled out of the National Wrestling Alliance. However, Kidman and Waltman lost the match to Karl Anderson and Joey Ryan.

===Return to WWE (2007–present)===
Kidman returned to WWE in 2007, helping train upcoming wrestlers in its then developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling throughout 2007 and 2008. On February 23, 2008, he wrestled his last match, losing to Afa Jr. Gruner was rehired by World Wrestling Entertainment in 2010 as a producer. On September 21, 2011, WWE ran a story on their website about Gruner and his role as a producer.

On April 9, 2012, Gruner along with former wrestlers Jamie Noble, Goldust and other officials and WWE wrestlers broke up the brawl between John Cena and Brock Lesnar. In November 2013, Gruner appeared on WWE&#x27;s European tour as Paul Heyman&#x27;s doctor, under the name of &quot;Dr. Weisenburg&quot;. On August 23, 2016 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, he appeared along with Jamie Noble to prevent Dolph Ziggler from attacking AJ Styles.

Kidman&#x27;s contract was furloughed by the company on April 15, 2020, due to COVID-19 cutbacks. He returned to the company on September 25, 2020.

==Personal life==
Gruner is Jewish. After being together for four years, Gruner married former WWE Diva Torrie Wilson on July 11, 2003. They lived together in Tampa, Florida when not traveling. The couple separated in mid-2006 and divorced in 2008.

A book detailing Gruner&#x27;s career, &quot;Billy Kidman: The Shooting Star,&quot; was released in early 2014.

In 2014, Kidman began appearing on &quot;The JBL Show&quot;, where he attempts to promote his Twitter account but is always interrupted due to technical difficulties, which has become a running gag on the show.

<text>Edison Pettit (September 22, 1889 – May 6, 1962) was an American astronomer.

He was born in Peru, Nebraska. Pettit received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Nebraska State Normal School in Peru. He taught astronomy at Washburn College in Topeka, Kansas from 1914 to 1918. He married Hannah Steele Pettit, who was an assistant at Yerkes Observatory, and received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1920.

Shortly after he became a staff member at Mount Wilson Observatory. He initially specialized in solar astronomy and built his own thermocouples. He also made visual observations of Mars and Jupiter. Even after his retirement he continued to make spectrographs for various observatories in the machine shop in his home. His two daughters, Marjorie Pettit Meinel and Helen Pettit Knaflich were both astronomers.

Pettit crater on the Moon and another Crater on Mars are named after him.

<text>James Talmadge Brown (born February 25, 1951) is an American sportscaster known for being the studio host of &quot;The James Brown Show&quot; and &quot;The NFL Today&quot; on CBS Sports. He is also a special correspondent for CBS News.

He is additionally known for serving as the former host of Fox Sports&#x27; NFL pregame show &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; for eleven years.

==Early life==
James Talmadge Brown was born on February 25, 1951, in Washington, D.C. to John and Maryann Brown. He is the nephew of famed Hollywood actor Clifton Powell. Brown attended DeMatha Catholic High School and was named to the All-Metropolitan boys basketball teams in 1967 and 1968 with teammates Sid Catlett, Steve Garrett, Aubrey Nash, and Wayne Locket. The team topped the high school national rankings that year under Coach Morgan Wootten; seven players on that squad went to Division I college teams. Brown later attended Harvard University, living in Grays Hall during his freshman year, and graduated with a degree in American government. He played for the basketball team, receiving All-Ivy League honors in his last three seasons and captaining the team as a senior. His roommate was future Harvard professor and activist Cornel West. He was drafted 62 overall by the Atlanta Hawks in 1973.

==Broadcasting career==

===CBS (1970s–1994)===
After failing to make a roster spot when he tried out for the NBA&#x27;s Atlanta Hawks in the mid-1970s, Brown entered the corporate world, working for such companies as Xerox and Eastman Kodak. Brown went into sports broadcasting in 1984 when he was offered a job doing Washington Bullets television broadcasts as well as an analyst job for &quot;The NBA on CBS&quot;, paired with Frank Glieber. He later moved on to an anchor position at WDVM-TV (later WUSA) in Washington and to some work at CBS Sports. Brown was rehired by CBS Sports in 1987, where he served as play-by-play announcer for the network&#x27;s NFL and college basketball coverage, as well as reporter for the NBA Finals (calling games with Tom Heinsohn during the 1990 NBA Playoffs) and the 1990 National League Championship Series. He also was host of the afternoon show from the 1992 Winter Olympics and the 1994 Winter Olympics. While at CBS he also was co-host of &quot;CBS Sports Saturday/Sunday&quot;.

===Fox, and back to CBS (1994–present)===
In 1994, Brown accepted the position of host of the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; pregame show. He shared the set with former football players Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long and former coach Jimmy Johnson. Cris Collinsworth and Ronnie Lott have also appeared on the program during Brown&#x27;s time there.

From 1994–1998, Brown was the lead studio host for &quot;NHL on Fox&quot;. He appeared in a similar capacity in the EA Sports video game &quot;NHL &#x27;97&quot;, which used full-motion video. His voice appeared in &quot;Madden NFL 2001&quot;. On August 23, 1997, Brown filled-in for Chip Caray as the studio host for &quot;Fox Saturday Baseball&quot;.

James Brown worked for the joint HBO/Showtime pay-per-view boxing match involving Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson.

Following the 2005 NFL season, Brown left Fox in order to rejoin CBS Sports, citing a desire to remain closer to his home in Washington, D.C.

Brown was removed from college basketball coverage for CBS after a one-year stint in 2007. However, he still hosts the college basketball pregame, halftime and postgame in the CBS studios in New York City while Greg Gumbel, the main host, is on assignment.

===Other appearances===

Brown has also hosted &quot;The World&#x27;s Funniest!&quot; (the Fox network&#x27;s counterpart of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;), &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (a syndicated radio show formerly hosted by Bob Costas), and served as a correspondent for &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot;. Brown appeared on an episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; in a November 24, 1996 episode titled &quot;A Bundy Thanksgiving&quot;.

Aside from his Showtime and CBS duties, Brown hosted a weekday radio sports talk show that aired weekdays on Sporting News Radio for several years. Brown left the network in April 2006. He has since, returned to Sporting News Radio with Arnie Spanier.

<text>The Reavers are a fictional team of criminal cyborgs appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 

In the Marvel Universe, the Reavers are characters dedicated to the destruction of the X-Men and a number of them especially wanted to take revenge on Wolverine in particular. The group are assembled under the leadership of character Donald Pierce and consist of three survivors from a group of Australian cyborgs who formed the original &#x27;Reavers&#x27;, along with other cyborgs.

The Reavers are not to be confused with the Reavers who are involved in the histories of the Guardians of the Galaxy members Starhawk and Aleta.

The Reavers appeared in the 2017 film &quot;Logan&quot; with their leader Donald Pierce portrayed by Boyd Holbrook.

==Publication history==
The Reavers first appeared in the comic title &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #229 (May 1988) and were created by Chris Claremont and Marc Silvestri.

==Fictional group history==
===Looters===
The original group of cyborgs calling themselves the Reavers operated out of an underground complex beneath the fictional ghost town of Cooterman&#x27;s Creek in North Central Australia. They acted as a commando-style team of thieves, with apparently dozens of members. Their base was inexplicably equipped with advanced computers and a sub-basement tunnel system. The Reavers coerced the mutant teleporter Gateway to teleport them from Australia to locations around the world to conduct their robberies. Informed of the Reavers&#x27; existence by Roma, the X-Men defeat the Reavers in battle and expel them from their base, which they then co-opt for their own use. The X-Men destroy some of the Reavers and force most of the rest to enter the mystical Siege Perilous to meet unrevealed fates. Only Pretty Boy, Skullbuster, and Bonebreaker escape.

===Donald Pierce&#x27;s Reavers===
The Reavers are reassembled under the leadership of Donald Pierce, who reorganizes the team as an assassination squadron to undertake para-military style commando operations, dedicated to taking vengeance on the X-Men in particular and eliminating mutants in general. Pierce combines the three survivors of the original Reavers with Lady Deathstrike and the three former Hellfire Club mercenaries Cole, Macon, and Reese. No explanation is given for why Pretty Boy, Skullbuster, and Bonebreaker came to be involved with the group, aside from Pierce claiming to have created the original Reavers. Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s reasons for joining the Reavers are even more unclear, as she professes a lack of interest in their goal of eliminating mutants.

While the X-Men are away from their Australian base, the Reavers retake the ghost town and wait for the team to come back. However, on their return, the X-Men escape the Reavers through the Siege Perilous. Only Wolverine, who is on a leave of absence in Madripoor, remains. Once he returns, they capture him, and proceed to torture and crucify him. Wolverine escapes the Reavers with the aid of Jubilee. The Reavers then attack the Muir Island Mutant Research Center, theorizing that it is Wolverine&#x27;s most likely destination. They fight Freedom Force and Moira MacTaggart&#x27;s alternate X-Men team, and kill Stonewall and Sunder. During the assault on Muir Island, Skullbuster is rendered inoperative by sniper fire from Forge. Donald Pierce rescues a gravely wounded pilot named Cylla Markham, who agrees to be converted into a cyborg.

Around this time, Bonebreaker, Reese, and Pretty Boy are dispatched to a New York warehouse after Microchip, an associate of the Punisher, in a self-confessed mistake, infiltrates their computer system. The temporary absence of Gateway gives Punisher and Microchip enough time to evacuate and set up resistance. The warehouse is destroyed, but the two escape through the sewer. The Reavers face off against the Punisher again. In the firefight, the Reavers kill Microchip&#x27;s cousin. The Punisher sets off auto-destruct charges, which cause heavy damage to the three Reavers, particularly Bonebreaker, whose cybernetic lower body is demolished. The Reavers retreat.

The Reavers then successfully attack the White Queen&#x27;s company, Frost Technotics. They capture Rogue, who has returned from inside the Siege Perilous, although Rogue is then rescued by a recreation of Ms. Marvel. Donald Pierce transforms Cylla Markham into the new Skullbuster (although she usually goes by the name Cylla). Lady Deathstrike later seeks Wolverine in Madripoor and Vancouver. Pierce creates an android named Elsie-Dee and a Wolverine android double named &quot;Albert&quot; to kill Wolverine. The attempt fails, however, when Elsie-Dee rebels against her programming.

===Upstarts and humans===
As part of the Upstarts&#x27; game, Trevor Fitzroy dispatches his own Sentinels to the Reavers&#x27; Australian hideout to kill Pierce and anyone else they find there. In the ensuing battle, only Pierce, Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape the massacre, Pierce seemingly only making it as far as the Hellfire Club before he is &quot;killed&quot;. Cylla later resurfaces, allying herself with Bloodscream in an attempt to murder Wolverine. However, Bloodscream betrays her and sucks the life from her, killing her.

However, most Reavers somehow survive their supposed deaths. They later return to battle the X-Treme X-Men on behalf of the Shadow King.

Donald Pierce puts together a new group of Reavers, composed of young anti-mutant humans (with the exception of Elixir, who at the time was unaware that he was a mutant). They are defeated by Karma, Elixir, and a handful of young mutants. The group later breaks Pierce out of prison, but with Elixir as bait, they are lured into an ambush and captured by the same five mutants who stopped Pierce when he first betrayed the Hellfire Club&#x27;s Inner Circle.

===Messiah Complex===

The Reavers return to play a role in the comic book crossover storyline Messiah Complex event under the leadership of Lady Deathstrike. Judging from the design of their costumes, as well as their rhetoric in battle, these newest Reavers are simply existing members of the Purifiers upgraded with cybernetics rather than classic members of the team. Deployed as an elite commando unit designed to eliminate organized mutant resistance, the Reavers manage to track down and confront Cable in Alberta, Canada before being attacked by the new X-Force.

In the ensuing battle, Deathstrike and the Reavers are all terminated by Wolverine&#x27;s strike team, but not before killing the mutant Caliban and injuring Cable. To this date only Deathstrike&#x27;s fate was revealed, and it remains to be seen whether the Purifiers will be able to upgrade more of their fighters with Reaver technology to replace the ones lost in Canada.

===Cable and X-Force===
The Reavers play a small role in &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot; - Volume 4. Pretty Boy, Bonebreaker, Skullbuster (female), and Skullbuster (male) are quickly dispatched by Hope Summers and Cable before being able to deploy an ICBM.

===Hunt for Wolverine===
During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Donald Pierce later leads a new group of Reavers, composed of Star and Shine whom together go by the Starshine moniker, Pretty Boy, Skullbuster (Cylla Markham) and Bonebreaker. They were able to find the place where the X-Men had hidden Wolverine&#x27;s metal-encased body until an X-Men found them. During the battle, Wolverine&#x27;s adamantium shell was broken and to the Reavers surprise it was empty. The X-Men eventually defeated the Reavers and delivered them to Alpha Flight. Only Starshine was able to evade capture and contacted Lady Deathstrike about their findings.

===Indocterination and Ascent===
For the past few months, Pierce and his Reavers were stuck in the custody of the O*N*E under the direct supervision of a corrupt mutant-hating P.L.O named General Callahan. Who, after they had been left on the office&#x27;s doorstep by the dwindling Alpha Flight, had been using the bionic villains as a personal scavenger crew, running them ragged doing dirty business in pursuit of the military officer&#x27;s shady agenda of illicitly capturing and incarcerating mutants or mutant-related subjects. In exchange for their incarceration, Robert would give them much-needed augmentations and bionic enhancements tethered to an in-built safeguard to enforce their obedience.

After a while, the agreement made between the two factions would cause enforced loyalties to fray. With many Reavers absconding from their internment, only Scylla and the team leader would be dragged back. The rest were given kill orders for their desertion. A few amongst their desperate number would come across a couple of the priority targets on the general&#x27;s watchlist. After a lengthy battle, it is revealed that the reason why the office of National Emergency had them hunting these individuals was due to the possibility of one amongst their number unknowingly possessing the final piece of equipment needed to initiate a whole new sentinel program their employer&#x27;s outfit had been building up too.

Havok would opt to team up with the distaff cyborg mercenaries to free their boss and fellow mutants in exchange for the missing puzzle piece he possesses on his person for one final assault on their shared enemy&#x27;s headquarters. But they soon betray Beast, Havok, Warpath, and the recently freed Dazzler by displaying all that the techno-organic coding Alex had implanted on him by Bastion during his moral inversion could really do, Pretty Boy and Bonebreaker technologically overtaking the general&#x27;s incomplete sentinels and turning them on the X-Men. Believing they&#x27;d killed their shortlived allies, Donald and his cohorts absconded with their latest modifications and headed to the Xavier Institute to kill more mutants. But the misconceived done away with uncanny&#x27;s soon catch up to them and battle the Reavers into submission, both them and Summers ending up incarcerated by the Office.

===Operating in Madripoor===
During the &quot;Iron Man 2020&quot; event, Donald Pierce and the Reavers are shown to have established a company called Reavers Universal Robotics in Hightown, Madripoor. Albert shows up there to confront Donald Pierce where he is confronted by Bonebreaker and the Reavers. Pierce arrives to prevent the lobby from being wrecked. Taking Albert on a tour, Pierce states that he has been upgrading his operations with the help of a 3D Printer. When Pierce stated that Elsie-Dee is not here and that she previously appeared asking to have her self-destruct mechanism disarmed, Albert retaliates while claiming that Pierce doesn&#x27;t own him or Elsie Dee. After Albert subdues the Reavers, Pierce states that he sold Elsie-Dee&#x27;s head to Yakuza boss Kimura, the arms to the Jade Dragon Triad, and the legs to the Vladivostok Mafia. In light of Albert&#x27;s actions towards them, the Reavers, Kimura, the Jade Dragon Triad, and the Vladivostok Mafia to take action against Albert vowing that he will never make it out of Madripoor alive.

<text>Thomas Nevile ( – 2 May 1615) was an English clergyman and academic who was Dean of Peterborough (1591–1597) and Dean of Canterbury (1597–1615), Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge (1582–1593), and Master of Trinity College, Cambridge (1593–1615).

==Origins==
He was born in Canterbury, a son of Richard Neville of South Leverton, Nottinghamshire (who moved to Canterbury in his retirement), a son of Alexander Neville, Escheator of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire in 1519–20. His mother was Anne Mantell, a daughter of Sir Walter Mantell of Nether Heyford, Northamptonshire. His brother was the scholar Alexander Neville (1544–1614). He bore the same arms as the prominent and ancient Neville family, Earls of Westmorland. The origins of the Neville family of South Leverton are unclear, but an early ancestor was Thomas Neville, Recorder of Nottingham and Member of Parliament for Nottingham in 1472.

==Career==
Nevile matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1564/5, becoming a Fellow in 1570. During a long and distinguished career he held a succession of prestigious ecclesiastical posts including the Deanery of both Peterborough and Canterbury, that allowed him to build substantial personal wealth. Within Cambridge, his popularity in the Court of Queen Elizabeth meant he found similar success there, both as Master of Magdalene College and as Vice Chancellor of the university in 1588. Then, in February 1593 Elizabeth appointed him to succeed John Still to the Mastership of Trinity, and it is for his mastership of Trinity that he is now best remembered.

The college he inherited was little more than the architectural remains of the colleges that had united to form Trinity, and he set about using both his personal wealth and influence to create a setting unrivalled in academic England. To quote Trevelyan, &quot;If Henry VIII founded Trinity, Nevile built it&quot;.

Over the next decade he razed a number of existing buildings to clear the space for the area now known as Great Court. This included moving Great Gate, the entrance gate to the college, 20 metres east brick by brick, and resulted in one of the largest enclosed courts in Europe.

In his final years he built an additional court, Nevile&#x27;s Court, paid for entirely by himself.

A monument showing two kneeling effigies representing Thomas and his brother Alexander survives in Canterbury Cathedral.

<doc id="838447" wikidata="Q849630" url="?curid=838447" title="Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)">
<text>Brian Kerr (born 3 March 1953) is an Irish football manager. Born in Dublin, Kerr grew up playing football and boxing. At the age of 13, he took his first coaching role with the Crumlin United under-11 side. Realising later that he didn&#x27;t have the talent to become a top player, he decided to focus on coaching. In 1986, he was appointed manager of the League of Ireland side St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. In 1992, when the club was facing liquidation, Kerr was among the investors who raised IR£82,000 to help save the club. In December 1996, he left St Patrick&#x27;s to become the technical director of the Football Association of Ireland.

Kerr worked with the Republic of Ireland youth squads and also with the senior side. He was appointed as the full-time manager of the senior Ireland team on 26 January 2003. In 2007, Kerr became the Director of Football of St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. Then, in 2009, he was confirmed as the head coach of the Faroe Islands national team. He left that post in October 2011.

==Early days==
Kerr was born in Dublin, growing up in Drimnagh, a suburb in south west Dublin. He began playing football for noted schoolboy side Crumlin United along with future world champion athlete Eamonn Coghlan. He also boxed with Drimnagh Boxing Club as his father, the internationally famous many-time Irish Amateur bantamweight champion Frankie Kerr, was a coach there. At age 13, Kerr took his first coaching role when appointed to the Crumlin United vacant manager position. He gained employment in University College Dublin as a trainee technician, while following his football interests. Kerr, although playing for Shelbourne F.C. B team, realised he did not possess enough talent to make it to the top as a footballer and at an early age decided to concentrate on coaching.

Kerr was then invited by Liam Tuohy to manage Shamrock Rovers B side in 1974. Kerr managed the Irish Technical Schools team during this time. He was reserve team manager at Shelbourne in 1978 and after a stint playing for Bluebell United, he was appointed assistant manager at &quot;Shels&quot; in 1983. The following season, he moved to Home Farm.

Kerr coached under Liam Tuohy with the Irish youth side that reached the World Cup finals in 1985. He resigned in April 1986. Soon after he was appointed assistant manager at Drogheda United under Mick Lawlor but left following Lawlor&#x27;s resignation in November 1986.

==St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic==
In December 1986, Kerr was appointed manager of League of Ireland side St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. Kerr told reporters that as a fan of St. Pats, this appointment was a &quot;dream come true&quot;. Within 3 weeks Kerr had won his first senior trophy as St. Pats won the Leinster Senior Cup. It was the Inchicore side&#x27;s first trophy in a decade. Traditionally one of Ireland&#x27;s poorer clubs, Kerr immediately set about rebuilding the squad on a shoe string budget. He acquired several players from junior and schoolboy football (such as future international Curtis Fleming) and rescued others from reserve leagues. This included John McDonnell, who went on to become manager of the club himself. St. Pats drew 1–1 with Dundalk F.C. in the last game of the 1987/88 season when a win would have seen St. Pats gain their first league title since 1956. In 1990, Kerr led St. Pats to that long cherished league championship.

As financial troubles hit St. Pats, Kerr was forced to offload his star players and all bar John Treacy left by 1993. In 1992, with the club facing liquidation, Kerr was among a group of investors (many of whom re-mortgaged their houses) who raised IR£82,000 which helped save the club from extinction. Once again Kerr was left the job of rebuilding a totally new squad and once again he showed he was more than capable as St. Pats won the league again 1996. In December 1996, he shocked St. Pats by quitting to become technical director of the Football Association of Ireland. Kerr is still idolised by fans of St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic and most commentators attribute the further success the club have had largely down to the work started by Kerr.

==Republic of Ireland Youth coach==
As part of his technical director remit, Kerr was manager of Republic of Ireland sides from under-16 to under-20 level. His first major tournament was the 1997 World Youth Championships. Kerr surprised many commentators by bringing 3 players from the League of Ireland but was proved correct when Republic of Ireland won bronze medals by finishing third. The undoubted star of the Irish team was Damien Duff. 

The following year Kerr guided Republic of Ireland to an unprecedented double by winning both the under-16 and under-18 European Championships. No Irish team had ever won a major trophy before. A number of the players involved would go on to win full international caps, such as Richard Dunne, John O&#x27;Shea and Robbie Keane. In 1999, Ireland were knocked out of the World Youth Championships by hosts Nigeria on penalties in the round of 16. He again qualified Ireland for the 2003 World Youth Championships before taking up the position of manager of the senior national side.

==Republic of Ireland Senior Side==
The first two matches of Ireland&#x27;s qualification campaign for the 2004 European Championships in Portugal ended in defeat. The first was a 4–2 reverse away to Russia and the second a damaging 2–1 defeat at home to Switzerland. Mick McCarthy, who several months previously had taken the team to the knock-out stages of the 2002 World Cup, came under mounting pressure from fans and pundits alike and he resigned on 5 November 2002.

The Football Association of Ireland&#x27;s (FAI) search for a successor took them past Peter Reid, Bryan Robson and Philippe Troussier and eventually led them to Kerr who was officially unveiled as Republic of Ireland manager on 26 January 2003. Despite the somewhat haphazard nature of his appointment (several leaks meant that most media outlets had been alerted as to the FAI&#x27;s decision days in advance of the official announcement and Troussier was only notified of his failure to land the post after a member of the public phoned him to commiserate), Kerr was a popular choice for the position.

His background in Irish domestic football and his record with the Irish youth teams at under-16 and under-18 level meant that he enjoyed considerable support from within the domestic game and commanded the respect of talents such as Damien Duff and Robbie Keane - players that Kerr had managed in that capacity. Kerr enjoyed a reputation as one of the finest youth coaches in the world and also had no connection to the Saipan controversy that had engulfed the Irish team at the previous year&#x27;s World Cup which raised the possibility of a return to the squad for the talismanic Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane. Despite the positivity of his appointment, there were some who voiced doubts about his ability to manage at senior level.

Kerr faced a daunting challenge. His brief to take Ireland to the European Championships was compromised by the fact that the opening defeats left the team at the bottom of Group 10. The first competitive match of Kerr&#x27;s tenure took place on 29 March 2003 in what would turn out to be a tempestuous game in Dublin versus Georgia. Ireland won the match 2–1, a Gary Doherty goal six minutes from time securing the three points, but &quot;The Observer&quot; lamented &quot;disgraceful scenes&quot; as several Irish players were struck by missiles hurled from the crowd. No serious injuries were incurred and Ireland&#x27;s campaign had its first win.

Five days later the side travelled to Tirana to meet an Albania side that, although they had just recorded a historic win against group leaders Russia, were considered beatable opponents. In a game of few chances, Ireland failed to build on the momentum generated by the Georgia result and the game finished 0–0.

On 7 June 2003, in Kerr&#x27;s first competitive home match, Ireland welcomed Albania in the return fixture. Ireland secured a 2–1 win thanks to an injury time own goal from Albania&#x27;s veteran defender Adrian Aliaj but they were deemed fortunate to emerge as winners given that Albania appeared the more technically accomplished side with their midfield often outnumbering that of the visitors. Nevertheless, the three points were Ireland&#x27;s and after Switzerland and Russia drew their match in Basel there was renewed optimism that Ireland could qualify and even top the group. Further evidence that Kerr was initiating a remarkable turnaround in form was provided by the 2–0 victory over Georgia at Lansdowne Road on 11 June 2003. Even though the team were deprived of star player Damien Duff through injury, Ireland turned in an aggressive and compact performance based on thwarting the away side&#x27;s more technical style and ensured victory via goals from Gary Doherty and Robbie Keane. Russia remained in pole position in the group but Ireland now had 10 points out of 12 under Kerr and had given themselves a fair chance of qualifying if positive results could be gained from the upcoming ties.

Russia arrived in Dublin for the 6 September clash with three points fewer than Ireland but with a game in hand. Anything less than a victory would be a serious blow to Ireland&#x27;s qualification hopes. Damien Duff produced a moment of inspiration to fire Ireland into the lead after 36 minutes. The Chelsea forward embarked on a slaloming run past three challenges before unleashing a 25-yard shot that deflected in off Victor Onopko. However seven minutes later the scores were level after Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given failed to collect a corner which allowed Sergei Ignashevich to steal in and divert the ball home from ten yards. Russia&#x27;s tactics effectively nullified Ireland - from whom Damien Duff proved the only credible attacking outlet - and the game finished level with Kerr&#x27;s tactics drawing some criticism afterwards for lacking creativity and an over-reliance on Duff to provide the inspiration necessary for unlocking defenses. Ireland remained second but the games in hand enjoyed by both Switzerland and Russia over them meant that a win away in Basel was vital if Ireland were to have any chance of qualifying. In the final game of the campaign, Ireland went down 2–0 due to goals from Hakan Yakin and Alexander Frei. The Swiss topped the group and qualified automatically. Russia&#x27;s emphatic 4–1 win over the Swiss the previous month and then their 3–1 win at home to Georgia saw them secure the play-off spot. Ireland would not be going to the European Championships in Portugal.

Despite the disappointment in failing to qualify, hopes remained high that Kerr would be able to lead the Irish team to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Ireland were drawn in UEFA Group 4 - once again alongside Switzerland - but also with the formidable challenge presented by the 1998 World Champions France, with Israel, Cyprus and Faroe Islands rounding out the group. On 4 September 2004, the campaign got off to a positive start with a 3–0 home win over Cyprus, Clinton Morrison, Andy Reid and Robbie Keane the scorers. Four days later, Ireland returned to the scene of their previous campaign&#x27;s elimination as they took on Switzerland in Basel. This time they were able to claim a 1–1 draw after Clinton Morrison opened the scoring with Hakan Yakin restoring parity for the home side.

Ireland&#x27;s daunting away trip to France was next, on 9 October, but injuries and suspensions had deprived the French team of a core of their strongest players - Zinedine Zidane, Patrick Vieira and Claude Makélélé among them - raising the possibility of an Irish victory. Boosted by the end of Roy Keane&#x27;s international exile, Ireland turned in a committed and disciplined performance and emerged with a deserved point in a match that finished 0–0 with the French evidently still suffering from their poor performance at that Summer&#x27;s European Championship. The result was received well but Damien Duff remarked that on the balance of play Ireland could, and perhaps should, have collected all three points. Five days later, this was followed by a 2–0 win over group minnows Faroe Islands at Lansdowne Road - a match in which Robbie Keane finally broke Niall Quinn&#x27;s record of 19 international goals but otherwise was characterised by poor Irish finishing.

At the next international break, on 26 March 2005, Ireland would take on Israel in Tel Aviv. Clinton Morrison put Ireland in front two minutes before the interval but, in what would result in the first serious criticism of Kerr&#x27;s reign, Ireland then stood off their opponents in the second half and allowed Israel to regain a foothold in the game. Abbas Souan&#x27;s last-minute equaliser ensured the game finished 1–1 and Ireland had dropped two extremely valuable points. But it was in the return fixture in June of that year that saw Ireland&#x27;s hopes for qualification take a serious blow and that some retrospectively remarked was the turning point for Kerr. After racing into a 2–0 lead thanks to goals from Ian Harte and Robbie Keane, Ireland again eased off and allowed the Israelis back into the game. Avi Yehiel and Avi Nimni equalised before half-time and the result finished 2–2. The result was described as &quot;devastating&quot; by the Irish team and it now placed additional pressure on securing home wins against Switzerland and, ominously, France if qualification was to be assured. A routine 2–0 win away to the Faroes four days later did little to lift hopes.

On 7 September 2005, Ireland welcomed France to Lansdowne Road. France were now a different proposition to the side that had drawn with Ireland in Paris the previous year and could now welcome back their first-choice players who had missed that game. Ireland produced a battling performance but, after 70 minutes and with the home side seemingly having run out of attacking ideas, they were powerless to prevent Thierry Henry&#x27;s wonder strike which curled past Given from 25 yards out. The result was a massive blow to Ireland&#x27;s qualification hopes and they now had to hope to win their remaining games - away to Cyprus and at home to Switzerland - while hoping other results went their way.

Cyprus were dispatched 1–0 after an early goal from Stephen Elliott but in the home game against Switzerland, with qualification still a possibility, Ireland produced few chances. With 25 minutes remaining Kerr withdrew Robbie Keane - by now the country&#x27;s record goalscorer - and the in-form Clinton Morrison, replacing them with Stephen Elliott and Gary Doherty. The gamble failed and the game finished 0–0. Ireland had again failed to qualify for a major tournament under Kerr.

Kerr faced vocal criticism from pundits for his conservative approach and rumours that Damien Duff was not happy with the manager&#x27;s tactics. Kerr was now out of contract and speculation emerged as to the merits of awarding him a renewal. Not long after the end of the qualification campaign, Kerr appeared on Irish television in an interview in which some observers said effectively mounted to him issuing a public plea for a new contract. It was to no avail as the FAI announced on 18 October 2005 that they would not continue with Kerr. Despite the fact that the team had lost only once in qualification, Kerr&#x27;s record of one defeat, five draws and just four wins had signaled the end of his tenure as Ireland manager. He was replaced by Steve Staunton.

==St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic Director of Football==
In March 2007, Kerr returned to St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic football club, this time taking a position as Director of Football, a role to which he was appointed by new club owner Garrett Kelleher. His duties at the club included technical support to the management team, as well as scouting of youth players. On 19 May 2008, Kerr announced his resignation from his role as director of football at St Pat&#x27;s with immediate effect. Despite being strongly linked with a vacant managerial position at Cork City a number of months later, a return to Irish club management for Kerr was not to materialise.

==Coach of Faroe Islands==
On 6 April 2009, Kerr was confirmed as head coach of the Faroe Islands national football team. He stated on the Irish talk show Tubridy Tonight that the Faroese language was &#x27;50% Norsk Bokmal, 50% Gaeilge&#x27;.

His first game as manager was on 10 June 2009 against Serbia in Tórshavn, in which they lost 2–0. Apart from four players who played full-time in Denmark and another in Iceland, the rest of Kerr&#x27;s 22-man squad was made up of part-time players who were either working or studying.

On 9 September 2009, the Faroe Islands won 2–1 against Lithuania in a 2010 World Cup qualifying game, their first World Cup qualifying win since September 2001. On 17 November 2009, a documentary aired on RTÉ called &quot;Away with the Faroes&quot;, about Kerr taking over as the Faroes boss.

On 12 October 2010, the Faroe Islands drew 1–1 against Northern Ireland in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier for their first point of the qualifying campaign. This point was built upon with a 2–0 win over Estonia on 7 June 2011, a first Euro qualifier win for the Faroes since their 1995 victory over San Marino. The win still left Faroe Islands bottom of the table, but with 4 points. On 26 October 2011, Kerr stepped down as coach of the Faroese national team, after the Faroe Islands Football Association (FSF) announced that &quot;it was not possible to agree a new contract with Brian Kerr&quot;.
&quot;I gave it the best I could and I spent a lot of time away. I&#x27;m happy enough that we moved forward in the last three years and we had some very special days&quot;, he said on leaving.

==Other work==
Kerr turned his attention to television as a studio analyst and co-commentator for RTÉ Sport. On 21 August 2016, while commenting on the Burnley vs Liverpool match, he stated the following: &quot;I must say about Klavan, they surprised me when they signed him. He plays for Estonia, he has about 120 caps. He played against the Faroes when I was in the Faroes and I remember studying him before the match and thinking he was a bit of a weak link. I never thought he was a fella who would be playing for Liverpool in the Premier League. Maybe my judgement wasn&#x27;t very good but we got three goals against him with the Faroes.&quot; This was confirmed to be untrue by the Estonian FA who replied to Kerr&#x27;s allegations stating many inaccuracies as Klavan was not involved in the suggested game.
Kerr currently works as a studio analyst for matches shown on Virgin Media Sport.

==Activism==

In 2016, Kerr was one of two Irish sportspeople along with Timmy Hammersley to put his name to an open letter protesting Bank of Ireland&#x27;s decision to shut down the accounts of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign.

<doc id="838449" wikidata="Q1058276" url="?curid=838449" title="Atheroma">
<text>An atheroma, or atheromatous plaque, is an abnormal accumulation of material in the inner layer of an arterial wall.

The material consists of mostly macrophage cells, or debris, containing lipids, calcium and a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue. The accumulated material forms a swelling in the artery wall, which may intrude into the lumen of the artery, narrowing it and restricting blood flow. Atheroma is the pathological basis for the disease entity atherosclerosis, a subtype of arteriosclerosis.

==Signs and symptoms==
For most people, the first symptoms result from atheroma progression within the heart arteries, most commonly resulting in a heart attack and ensuing debility. The heart arteries are difficult to track because they are small (from about 5 mm down to microscopic), they are hidden deep within the chest and they never stop moving. Additionally, all mass-applied clinical strategies focus on both minimal cost and the overall safety of the procedure. Therefore, existing diagnostic strategies for detecting atheroma and tracking response to treatment have been extremely limited. The methods most commonly relied upon, patient symptoms and cardiac stress testing, do not detect any symptoms of the problem until atheromatous disease is very advanced because arteries enlarge, not constrict, in response to increasing atheroma. It is plaque ruptures, producing debris and clots which obstruct blood flow downstream, sometimes also locally (as seen on angiograms), which reduce/stop blood flow. Yet these events occur suddenly and are not revealed in advance by either stress tests or angiograms.

==Mechanism==
The healthy epicardial coronary artery consists of three layers, the tunica intima, media, and adventitia. Atheroma and changes in the artery wall usually result in small aneurysms (enlargements) just large enough to compensate for the extra wall thickness with no change in the lumen diameter. However, eventually, typically as a result of rupture of vulnerable plaques and clots within the lumen over the plaque, stenosis (narrowing) of the vessel develops in some areas. Less frequently, the artery enlarges so much that a gross aneurysmal enlargement of the artery results. All three results are often observed, at different locations, within the same individual.

===Stenosis and closure===
Over time, atheromata usually progress in size and thickness and induce the surrounding muscular central region (the media) of the artery to stretch out, which is termed &quot;remodeling&quot;. Typically, remodeling occurs just enough to compensate for the atheroma&#x27;s size such that the calibre of the artery opening (lumen) remains unchanged, until about 50% of the artery wall cross-sectional area consists of atheromatous tissue.

If the muscular wall enlargement eventually fails to keep up with the enlargement of the atheroma volume, or a clot forms and organizes over the plaque, then the lumen of the artery becomes narrowed as a result of repeated ruptures, clots and fibrosis over the tissues separating the atheroma from the blood stream. This narrowing becomes more common after decades of living, increasingly more common after people are in their 30s to 40s.

The endothelium (the cell monolayer on the inside of the vessel) and covering tissue, termed fibrous cap, separate atheroma from the blood in the lumen. If a rupture (see vulnerable plaque) of the endothelium and fibrous cap occurs, then both a shower of debris from the plaque (debris larger than 5 micrometres are too large to pass through capillaries) combined with a platelet and clotting response (an injury/repair response to both the debris and at the rupture site) begins within fractions of a second, eventually resulting in narrowing or sometimes closure of the lumen. Eventually downstream tissue damage occurs due to closure or obstruction of downstream microvessels and/or closure of the lumen at the rupture, both resulting in loss of blood flow to downstream tissues. This is the principal mechanism of myocardial infarction, stroke or other related cardiovascular disease problems.

While clots at the rupture site typically shrink in volume over time, some of the clot may become organized into fibrotic tissue resulting in narrowing of the artery lumen; the narrowings sometimes seen on angiography examinations, if severe enough. Since angiography methods can only reveal larger lumens, typically larger than 200 micrometres, angiography after a cardiovascular event commonly does not reveal what happened.

===Artery enlargement===
If the muscular wall enlargement is overdone over time, then a gross enlargement of the artery results, usually over decades of living. This is a less common outcome. Atheroma within aneurysmal enlargement (vessel bulging) can also rupture and shower debris of atheroma and clot downstream. If the arterial enlargement continues to 2 to 3 times the usual diameter, the walls often become weak enough that with just the stress of the pulse, a loss of wall integrity may occur leading to sudden hemorrhage (bleeding), major symptoms and debility; often rapid death. The main stimulus for aneurysm formation is pressure atrophy of the structural support of the muscle layers. The main structural proteins are collagen and elastin. This causes thinning and the wall balloons allowing gross enlargement to occur, as is common in the abdominal region of the aorta.

==Histology==
The accumulation (swelling) is always in the tunica intima, between the endothelium lining and the smooth muscle middle layer of the artery wall. While the early stages, based on gross appearance, have traditionally been termed fatty streaks by pathologists, they are not composed of fat cells but of accumulations of white blood cells, especially macrophages, that have taken up oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL).

After they accumulate large amounts of cytoplasmic membranes (with associated high cholesterol content) they are called foam cells. When foam cells die, their contents are released, which attracts more macrophages and creates an extracellular lipid core near the centre to inner surface of each atherosclerotic plaque. 

Conversely, the outer, older portions of the plaque become more calcified, less metabolically active and more physically stiff over time.

Veins do not develop atheromata, because they are not subjected to the same haemodynamic pressure that arteries are, unless surgically moved to function as an artery, as in bypass surgery. In fact, veins grafted to function as arteries in bypass surgeries tend to show faster formation of atheromata, while (in rabbits) arteries grafted to function as veins also do not grow atheromata.

==Diagnosis==
Because artery walls enlarge at locations with atheroma, detecting atheroma before death and autopsy has long been problematic at best. Most methods have focused on the openings of arteries; while these methods are highly relevant, they totally miss the atheroma within the arterial lumen.

Historically, arterial wall fixation, staining and thin section has been the gold standard for detection and description of atheroma, after death and autopsy. With special stains and examination, micro calcifications can be detected, typically within smooth muscle cells of the arterial media near the fatty streaks within a year or two of fatty streaks forming.

Interventional and non-interventional methods to detect atherosclerosis, specifically vulnerable plaque (non-occlusive or soft plaque), are widely used in research and clinical practice today.

Carotid Intima-media thickness Scan (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography) measurement has been recommended by the American Heart Association as the most useful method to identify atherosclerosis and may now very well be the gold standard for detection.

Intravascular ultrasound and intravascular optical coherence tomography are the current most sensitive method detecting and measuring more advanced atheroma within living individuals, but has had limited applications due to cost and body invasiveness.

CT scans using state of the art higher resolution spiral, or the higher speed EBT, machines have been the most effective method for detecting calcification present in plaque. However, the atheroma have to be advanced enough to have relatively large areas of calcification within them to create large enough regions of ~130 Hounsfield units which a CT scanner&#x27;s software can recognize as distinct from the other surrounding tissues. Typically, such regions start occurring within the heart arteries about 2–3 decades after atheroma start developing. The presence of smaller, spotty plaques may actually be more dangerous for progressing to acute myocardial infarction.

Arterial ultrasound, especially of the carotid arteries, with measurement of the thickness of the artery wall, offers a way to partially track the disease progression. As of 2006, the thickness, commonly referred to as IMT for intimal-medial thickness, is not measured clinically though it has been used by some researchers since the mid-1990s to track changes in arterial walls. Traditionally, clinical carotid ultrasounds have only estimated the degree of blood lumen restriction, stenosis, a result of very advanced disease. The National Institute of Health did a five-year $5 million study, headed by medical researcher Kenneth Ouriel, to study intravascular ultrasound techniques regarding atherosclerotic plaque. More progressive clinicians have begun using IMT measurement as a way to quantify and track disease progression or stability within individual patients.

Angiography, since the 1960s, has been the traditional way of evaluating for atheroma. However, angiography is only motion or still images of dye mixed with the blood within the arterial lumen and never show atheroma; the wall of arteries, including atheroma within the arterial wall remain invisible. The limited exception to this rule is that with very advanced atheroma, with extensive calcification within the wall, a halo-like ring of radiodensity can be seen in most older humans, especially when arterial lumens are visualized end-on. On cine-floro, cardiologists and radiologists typically look for these calcification shadows to recognize arteries before they inject any contrast agent during angiograms.

===Classification of lesions===
* Type I: Isolated macrophage foam cells
* Type II: Multiple foam cell layers
* Type III: Preatheroma, intermediate lesion
* Type IV: Atheroma
* Type V: Fibroatheroma
* Type VI: Fissured, ulcerated, hemorrhagic, thrombotic lesion
* Type VII: Calcific lesion
* Type VIII: Fibrotic lesion

==Treatment==

Many approaches have been promoted as methods to reduce or reverse atheroma progression:
* eating a diet of raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, berries, and grains;
* consuming foods containing omega−3 fatty acids such as fish, fish-derived supplements, as well as flax seed oil, borage oil, and other non-animal-based oils;
* abdominal fat reduction;
* aerobic exercise;
* inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis (known as statins);
* low normal blood glucose levels (glycated hemoglobin, also called HbA1c);
* micronutrient (vitamins, potassium, and magnesium) consumption;
* maintaining normal, or healthy, blood pressure levels;
* aspirin supplement
* mouse studies indicated that subcutaneous administration of oligosaccharide 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2HPβCD) can solubilize cholesterol, removing it from plaques. However, later work concluded that &quot;treatment with 2HPβCD is ineffective in inducing atherosclerosis regression&quot;.

When a plaque is dangerous enough, it may warrant physical intervention such as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or carotid endarterectomy. Of these, endarterectomy involves cutting open the affected artery to remove the plaque. 

==History of research==
In developed countries, with improved public health, infection control and increasing life spans, atheroma processes have become an increasingly important problem and burden for society.
Atheromata continue to be the primary underlying basis for disability and death, despite a trend for gradual improvement since the early 1960s (adjusted for patient age). Thus, increasing efforts towards better understanding, treating and preventing the problem are continuing to evolve.

According to United States data, 2004, for about 65% of men and 47% of women, the first symptom of cardiovascular disease is myocardial infarction (heart attack) or sudden death (death within one hour of symptom onset).

A significant proportion of artery flow-disrupting events occur at locations with less than 50% lumenal narrowing. Cardiac stress testing, traditionally the most commonly performed non-invasive testing method for blood flow limitations, generally only detects lumen narrowing greater than about 75%, although some physicians advocate nuclear stress tests that can sometimes detect as little as 50%.

The sudden nature of the complications of pre-existing atheroma, vulnerable plaque (non-occlusive or soft plaque), have led, since the 1950s, to the development of intensive care units and complex medical and surgical interventions. Angiography and later cardiac stress testing was begun to either visualize or indirectly detect stenosis. Next came bypass surgery, to plumb transplanted veins, sometimes arteries, around the stenoses and more recently angioplasty, now including stents, most recently drug coated stents, to stretch the stenoses more open.

Yet despite these medical advances, with success in reducing the symptoms of angina and reduced blood flow, atheroma rupture events remain the major problem and still sometimes result in sudden disability and death despite even the most rapid, massive and skilled medical and surgical intervention available anywhere today. According to some clinical trials, bypass surgery and angioplasty procedures have had at best a minimal effect, if any, on improving overall survival. Typically mortality of bypass operations is between 1 and 4%, of angioplasty between 1 and 1.5%.

Additionally, these vascular interventions are often done only after an individual is symptomatic, often already partially disabled, as a result of the disease. It is also clear that both angioplasty and bypass interventions do not prevent future heart attack.

The older methods for understanding atheroma, dating to before World War II, relied on autopsy data. Autopsy data has long shown initiation of fatty streaks in later childhood with slow asymptomatic progression over decades.

One way to see atheroma is the very invasive and costly IVUS ultrasound technology; it gives us the precise volume of the inside intima plus the central media layers of about of artery length. Unfortunately, it gives no information about the structural strength of the artery. Angiography does not visualize atheroma; it only makes the blood flow within blood vessels visible. Alternative methods that are non or less physically invasive and less expensive per individual test have been used and are continuing to be developed, such as those using computed tomography (CT; led by the electron beam tomography form, given its greater speed) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most promising since the early 1990s has been EBT, detecting calcification within the atheroma before most individuals start having clinically recognized symptoms and debility. Statin therapy (to lower cholesterol) does not slow the speed of calcification as determined by CT scan. MRI coronary vessel wall imaging, although currently limited to research studies, has demonstrated the ability to detect vessel wall thickening in asymptomatic high risk individuals. As a non-invasive, ionising radiation free technique, MRI based techniques could have future uses in monitoring disease progression and regression. Most visualization techniques are used in research, they are not widely available to most patients, have significant technical limitations, have not been widely accepted and generally are not covered by medical insurance carriers.

From human clinical trials, it has become increasingly evident that a more effective focus of treatment is slowing, stopping and even partially reversing the atheroma growth process. There are several prospective epidemiologic studies including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), which have supported a direct correlation of Carotid Intima-media thickness (CIMT) with myocardial infarction and stroke risk in patients without cardiovascular disease history. The ARIC Study was conducted in 15,792 individuals between 5 and 65 years of age in four different regions of the US between 1987 and 1989. The baseline CIMT was measured and measurements were repeated at 4- to 7-year intervals by carotid B mode ultrasonography in this study. An increase in CIMT was correlated with an increased risk for CAD. The CHS was initiated in 1988, and the relationship of CIMT with risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was investigated in 4,476 subjects 65 years of age and below. At the end of approximately six years of follow-up, CIMT measurements were correlated with cardiovascular events.

Paroi artérielle et Risque Cardiovasculaire in Asia Africa/Middle East and Latin America (PARC-AALA) is another important large-scale study, in which 79 centres from countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America participated, and the distribution of CIMT according to different ethnic groups and its association with the Framingham cardiovascular score was investigated. Multi-linear regression analysis revealed that an increased Framingham cardiovascular score was associated with CIMT, and carotid plaque independent of geographic differences.

Cahn et al. prospectively followed-up 152 patients with coronary artery disease for 6–11 months by carotid artery ultrasonography and noted 22 vascular events (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and coronary angioplasty) within this time period. They concluded that carotid atherosclerosis measured by this non-interventional method has prognostic significance in coronary artery patients.

In the Rotterdam Study, Bots et al. followed 7,983 patients &gt;55 years of age for a mean period of 4.6 years, and reported 194 incident myocardial infarctions within this period. CIMT was significantly higher in the myocardial infarction group compared to the other group. Demircan et al. found that the CIMT of patients with acute coronary syndrome were significantly increased compared to patients with stable angina pectoris.

It has been reported in another study that a maximal CIMT value of 0.956 mm had 85.7% sensitivity and 85.1% specificity to predict angiographic CAD. The study group consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD our patients. There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials have been slow to provide clinical &amp; medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.

Additionally, understanding what drives atheroma development is complex with multiple factors involved, only some of which, such as lipoproteins, more importantly lipoprotein subclass analysis, blood sugar levels and hypertension are best known and researched. More recently, some of the complex immune system patterns that promote, or inhibit, the inherent inflammatory macrophage triggering processes involved in atheroma progression are slowly being better elucidated in animal models of atherosclerosis.

<text>Hiroshima is a 1946 book by American author John Hersey. It tells the stories of six survivors of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It is regarded as one of the earliest examples of New Journalism, in which the story-telling techniques of fiction are adapted to non-fiction reporting. 

The work was originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which had planned to run it over four issues but instead dedicated the entire edition of August 31, 1946, to a single article. Less than two months later, the article was printed as a book by Alfred A. Knopf. Never out of print, it has sold more than three million copies. &quot;Its story became a part of our ceaseless thinking about world wars and nuclear holocaust,&quot; &quot;New Yorker&quot; essayist Roger Angell wrote in 1995.

== Background ==
Before writing &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, Hersey had been a war correspondent in the field, writing for &quot;Life&quot; magazine and &quot;The Nan&quot; working in the Pacific Theater and followed Lt. John F. Kennedy through the Solomon Islands. One of the first Western journalists to view the ruins of Hiroshima after the bombing, Hersey was commissioned by William Shawn of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; to write articles about the impact of a nuclear explosion by using witness accounts, a subject virtually untouched by journalists. Hersey interviewed many witnesses; he focused his article on six in particular.

=== Publication in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; ===
Hersey&#x27;s article was published in the August 31, 1946, issue and began where the magazine&#x27;s regular &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; column usually began. At the bottom of the page, the editors appended a short note: &quot;TO OUR READERS. The New Yorker this week devotes its entire editorial space to an article on the almost complete obliteration of a city by one atomic bomb, and what happened to the people of that city. It does so in the conviction that few of us have yet comprehended the all but incredible destructive power of this weapon, and that everyone might well take time to consider the terrible implications of its use. The Editors.&quot; One of the few people other than the principal editors of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; tipped to the forthcoming publication was the magazine&#x27;s principal writer E. B. White, to whom Harold Ross confided his plans. &quot;Hersey has written thirty thousand words on the bombing of Hiroshima (which I can now pronounce in a new and fancy way)&quot;, Ross wrote to White in Maine, &quot;one hell of a story, and we are wondering what to do about it ... [William Shawn, managing editor of The New Yorker] wants to wake people up, and says we are the people with a chance to do it, and probably the only people that will do it, if it is done.&quot;

=== Literary reception ===

Containing a detailed description of the bomb&#x27;s effects, the article was a publishing sensation. In plain prose, Hersey described the horrifying aftermath of the atomic device: people with melted eyeballs, or people vaporized, leaving only their shadows etched onto walls. The &quot;New Yorker&quot; article &quot;Hiroshima&quot; was an immediate best seller and was sold out at newsstands within hours. Many requests for reprints were received by the magazine&#x27;s offices. The ABC Radio Network preempted regular programming to broadcast readings of the complete text by well-known actors in four half-hour programs. Many radio stations abroad did likewise, including the BBC in Britain, where newsprint rationing that continued after the war&#x27;s end prevented its publication; Hersey would not permit editing of the piece to cut its length. The Book of the Month Club rushed a copy of the article into book format, which it sent to members as a free selection, saying &quot;We find it hard to conceive of anything being written that could be of more important at this moment to the human race.&quot;

Published a little more than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, it showed the American public a different interpretation of the Japanese from what had been previously described in the media. After reading &quot;Hiroshima,&quot; a Manhattan Project scientist wrote that he wept as he remembered how he had celebrated the dropping of the atomic bomb. Scientists along with the American public felt shame and guilt at the suffering of the people of Hiroshima. 

The 31,000 word article was published later the same year by Alfred A. Knopf as a book. Hersey&#x27;s work is often cited as one of the earliest examples of New Journalism in its melding of elements of non-fiction reportage with the pace and devices of the novel. Hersey&#x27;s plain prose was praised by critics as a model of understated narrative. Hersey rarely gave interviews and abhorred going on anything resembling book tours, as his longtime editor Judith Jones recalled. &quot;If ever there was a subject calculated to make a writer overwrought and a piece overwritten, it was the bombing of Hiroshima&quot;, wrote Hendrik Hertzberg; &quot;yet Hersey&#x27;s reporting was so meticulous, his sentences and paragraphs were so clear, calm and restrained, that the horror of the story he had to tell came through all the more chillingly.&quot;

The author said he adopted the plain style to suit the story he strove to tell. &quot;The flat style was deliberate&quot;, Hersey said 40 years later, &quot;and I still think I was right to adopt it. A high literary manner, or a show of passion, would have brought me into the story as a mediator. I wanted to avoid such mediation, so the reader&#x27;s experience would be as direct as possible.&quot;

The founder of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Harold Ross told his friend, author Irwin Shaw: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever got as much satisfaction out of anything else in my life.&quot; But &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s publication of Hersey&#x27;s article caused trouble with respect to Hersey&#x27;s relationship with Henry Luce, the co-founder of Time-Life and Hersey&#x27;s first mentor, who felt Hersey should have reported the event for one of Luce&#x27;s magazines instead. Despite Luce&#x27;s misgivings about Hersey&#x27;s choice of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; to print the Hiroshima story, the magazine&#x27;s format and style allowed the author much more freedom in reporting and writing. The Luce publications – &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot; – had nothing similar. Moreover, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; went to unprecedented lengths to keep the Hersey story secret. The weekly magazine&#x27;s top editors observed complete secrecy about the printing of the article. While editors Harold Ross and William Shawn spent long hours editing and deliberating every sentence, the magazine&#x27;s staff was not told anything about the forthcoming issue. Staffers were baffled when the normal weekly proofs were not returned, and their inquiries were not answered. Even the advertisement department was deliberately not informed.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine said about &quot;Hiroshima&quot;:

The magazine later termed Hersey&#x27;s account of the bombing &quot;the most celebrated piece of journalism to come out of World War II.&quot;

It was also met with approval by &quot;The New Republic&quot; which said &quot;Hersey&#x27;s piece is certainly one of the great classics of the war&quot;. While the majority of the excerpts praised the article, Mary McCarthy said that &quot;to have done the atomic bomb justice, Mr. Hersey would have had to interview the dead&quot;. It was quickly a book in the Book-of-the-Month Club; it was distributed for free because of the questions it raised about the humanity of the human race. &quot;Hiroshima&quot; was also read word for word on the radio by the American Broadcasting Company, amplifying its effects.

=== Publication in Japan ===
Although the US military government (headed by Douglas MacArthur) dissuaded publishers from bringing out the book in Japan, small numbers of copies were distributed; in January 1947 Hersey gave a reading in English in Tokyo. A Japanese translation of &quot;Hiroshima&quot; was first published in 1949 in Japan; it has not been out of print since. According to Gar Alperovitz in &quot;The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb&quot;, &quot;Occupation authorities suppressed various accounts of the atomic bombings. A noteworthy instance involved the denial in later 1946 of a request by the &quot;Nippon Times&quot; to publish John Hersey&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima&quot; (in English).&quot; MacArthur said in 1948 that despite numerous charges of censorship made against the censor&#x27;s office by the US news media, &quot;Hiroshima&quot; was not banned in Japan.

== Outline ==
The article begins on the morning of August 6, 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped, killing an estimated 135,000 people. The book begins with the following sentence:

Hersey introduces the six characters: two doctors, a Protestant minister, a widowed seamstress, a young female factory worker and a German Catholic priest. It describes their mornings before the bomb was dropped. Through the book, the lives of these six people overlap as they share similar experiences. Each chapter covers a time period from the morning of the bombing to one year later for each witness. An additional chapter covering the aftermath 40 years after the bombing was added in later editions.

The six characters are:

; Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto

Tanimoto is from the explosion. A pastor at Hiroshima Methodist Church, a small man in stature, &quot;quick to talk, laugh and cry&quot;, weak yet fiery, cautious and thoughtful, he was educated in theology in the U.S. at Emory University, in Atlanta, Georgia, speaks excellent English, obsessed with being spied on, Chairman of Neighborhood Association.

; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura

Nakamura is from explosion center. She is a widow of a tailor who is raising her three children (10-year-old boy Toshio, eight-year-old girl Yaeko, and five-year-old girl Myeko). Her husband had been killed in Singapore in 1942.

; Dr. Masakazu Fujii

Fujii is from explosion center. He is described as hedonistic, owner of a private 30-room hospital that contains modern equipment, has family living in Osaka and Kyushu, and is convivial and calm.

; Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge (Makoto Takakura)

Kleinsorge is from explosion center. Kleinsorge at the time is a 38-year-old German Jesuit priest. Weakened by his wartime diet, he feels unaccepted by the Japanese people and has a &quot;thin face, with a prominent Adam&#x27;s apple, a hollow chest, dangling hands, big feet.&quot;. His father superior within the mission station is Hugo Lassalle.

; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki

Dr. Terufumi Sasaki is from the center of the explosion. He works as a 25-year-old surgeon at the Red Cross Hospital. He lives with his mother in Mukaihara, an idealist. Upset with poor health services, he practices medicine without a permit in communities lacking in quality health care. He is not related to Miss Toshiko Sasaki.

; Miss Toshiko Sasaki (Sister Dominique Sasaki)

Sasaki is from the center of the explosion. She is 20 years old and engaged to a soldier, as well as working as a &quot;clerk in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works&quot;

=== &quot;A Noiseless Flash&quot; ===
This chapter introduces the characters and details the witnesses&#x27; accounts of the morning before and their perception of the explosion of the atomic bomb. The explosion occurred at exactly 8:15 am, local time. Miss Toshiko is at her desk and talking to a fellow employee at the Tin factory when the room filled with &quot; a blinding light&quot;. and the flash was so powerful that it pushed over a bookshelf crushing Miss Toshiko&#x27;s leg while she went unconscious. She was covered with a bookshelf while the building collapsed around her. While sitting on his porch, Dr. Masakuza Fujii witnessed a &quot;brilliant yellow&quot; flash and toppled into the river. He injured his shoulder severely. After returning to her home from a safe area, Mrs. Nakamura saw a flash &quot;whiter than any white she had&quot; seen before. She was thrown into the next room while her children were buried in debris. While reading his morning paper, Father Wilhem Kleinsorge witnesses a &quot;terrible flash ... [like] a large meteor colliding with the earth&quot;. He found himself in the vegetable garden of the missionary with only small cuts. Standing alone in a corridor, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki saw a &quot;gigantic photographic flash&quot;. The explosion ripped the hospital apart but Dr. Sasaki remained untouched except his glasses and shoes had been blown off his body. Dr. Sasaki was now the only doctor to be unhurt in the hospital and the hospital was quickly filled with patients. Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto saw a &quot;tremendous flash of light cut across the sky&quot;. Tanimoto threw himself against a wall of his home and felt pressure, splinters, and debris falls on him.

=== &quot;The Fire&quot; ===
Chapter 2 documents the time immediately after the explosion where the fires are spreading and the witnesses are trying to save others and find safety for themselves.
Immediately after the explosion, Reverend Tanimoto ran in search of his family and parishioners. He puts aside the search for his family when he comes across people in need of help and then resumes the search for his family. Mrs. Nakamura travels with her children and neighbor to Asano Park at the Jesuit mission house. Mrs. Nakamura and her children are continuously vomiting.
Father Kleinsorge is found wandering the mission grounds with numerous pieces of glass in his back. Father Kleinsorge ran into his room and grabbed a first aid kit and his suitcase containing money and paperwork of the mission. Father Kleinsorge and others go out and bring food back for everyone at Asano Park.

Dr. Fujii&#x27;s hospital was in the nearby river while he was trapped between its beams, unable to move. Dr. Fujii looks at the city and calls it &quot;an endless parade of misery&quot;.
Dr. Sasaki &quot;worked without method&quot; in deciding which patient would receive care next. Patients filled every inch of the hospital. People were throwing up everywhere. He became like a robot, repeating treatment on patient after patient. Miss Sasaki still lies unconscious under the bookshelf and crumbled building. Her leg is only severely broken. She is propped up alongside two badly wounded people and left. Father Kleinsorge sets off for Asano Park. Mr. Tanimoto has crossed town to find his family and parishioners. He apologizes to the wounded as he passes by for not being injured. Only out of luck does he run into his wife and child on the banks of the Ōta River. They split up so that she may return to Ushida and he may take care of the church.

=== &quot;Details are Being Investigated&quot; ===
Chapter three chronicles the days after the dropping of the bomb, the continuing troubles faced by the survivors, and the possible explanations for the massive devastation that the witnesses come across.

On August 12, the Nakamuras continued to be sick and discovered the rest of their family had perished. Mr. Tanimoto continues to ferry people from one side of the river to the other in hopes of bringing them to safety from the fires. Father Kleinsorge, weakened by his injuries and previous illness, remains in the Park. He is finally welcomed by the Japanese and no longer feels like a foreigner. Dr. Fujii sleeps on the floor of his destroyed family&#x27;s home. His left clavicle is broken and is covered in many deep cuts. Ten thousand wounded have shown up at the Red Cross Hospital. Dr. Sasaki is still trying to attend to as many people as possible. All that can be done is to put saline on the worst burns. Dead patients were lying everywhere. Miss Sasaki is still left with no help outside the factory. Finally friends come to locate her body and she is transferred to a hospital.

At the end of the chapter, on August 15, the war is over.

=== &quot;Panic Grass and Feverfew&quot; ===
It has been twelve days since the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Four square miles of the city had been completely destroyed. Since the bombing, Hiroshima has been flooded, which continued chaos and destruction. Many people are now developing radiation sickness and a hatred for the Americans has been festering but decreased once Hiroshima was designated to have safe radiation levels.
Father Kleinsorge&#x27;s wounds were examined and found to have reopened and become inflamed. Even into September, Father Kleinsorge is getting worse. He was taken to the hospital for a high fever, anemia and low leukocyte levels. Mrs. Nakamura still felt nauseated and her hair began to fall out. Once given the okay that the radiation levels in Hiroshima were acceptable and her appearance was presentable, she returned to her home to retrieve her sewing machine but it was rusted and ruined. Mr. Tanimoto also fell ill without any notice. His fever reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit and he was given Vitamin B1 injections to combat the radiation disease. Miss Sasaki remains hospitalized and in pain. The infection has prevented doctors from being able to set her fractured leg. She was discharged from the hospital at the end of April but was severely crippled. Dr. Fujii is still living in a friend&#x27;s summer home and his injuries have progressed well. He has been noting that many survivors are continuing to experience strange problems. He bought a new clinic in a Hiroshima suburb and once healed began a successful practice. Dr. Sasaki has been studying the progression of patients and assigned three stages to the disease. After six months, the Red Cross Hospital began to function normally. He remained the only surgeon on staff but finally had time to get married in March.

One year after the bombing, Mr. Tanimoto&#x27;s church had been ruined and he no longer had his exceptional vitality; Mrs. Nakamura was destitute; Dr. Fujii had lost the thirty-room hospital it took him many years to acquire, and no prospects of rebuilding it; Father Kleinsorge was back in the hospital; Dr. Sasaki was not capable of the work he had once done; Miss Sasaki was a cripple.

=== &quot;The Aftermath&quot; ===
This chapter was added forty years after the initial publication in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. It appeared in the July 15, 1985 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Hersey returned to Hiroshima to learn what has become of the six survivors. His record of what he found became chapter 5 in subsequent editions of the book. The survivors of the Hiroshima bombing are now referred to as hibakusha (explosion-affected people). The Japanese initially refused to take any responsibility for the American atomic bombing or the population affected. The victims were discriminated against, and many employers refused to hire a hibakusha because they could not work as hard. Their exposure, called &quot;A-bomb sickness&quot; in Japan, left them with chronic weakness, dizziness and digestive issues, among others. In 1954, the Lucky Dragon No. 5 contamination incident created a political movement for the hibakusha and created the A-bomb Victims Medical Care Law. This law allowed for medical attention for the hibakusha and a monthly allowance for them.

Kiyoshi Tanimoto continued to preach the gospel to the people rebuilding in Hiroshima. He was brought to the United States by the Methodist Board of Missions to raise money for his church. On March 5, 1949, his memorandum, &quot;Hiroshima Ideas&quot;, was published. In 1950, he returned to America for his second speaking tour. On this trip, he spoke to members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Because of his worldwide tours, he was nicknamed &quot;The A-bomb minister&quot;. In 1955, he returned to America with more Hiroshima Maidens, women who were school-age girls when they were seriously disfigured as a result of the bomb&#x27;s thermal flash, and who went to the U.S. for reconstructive surgery. During this trip, he appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; with Ralph Edwards. He was surprised to meet Captain Robert Lewis, the co-pilot of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;. He died on September 28, 1986.

For a time, Mrs. Nakamura made only enough income to get by and feed her family. She fell ill and could no longer work. To receive treatment, she was forced to sell her sewing machine. She worked odd jobs like delivering bread where she could take three or four days off to recover before working again. She continued to earn just enough to survive. She worked at a mothball factory for 13 years but did not immediately sign up for her health allowance through the A-bomb Victims Medical Care Law. She was invited to be a member of the Bereaved Family Association and traveled the world.

In 1948, Dr. Fujii built a new medical practice in Hiroshima. He was fortunate enough to face no long-lasting effects of the A-bomb sickness. Dr. Fujii died on January 12, 1973.

Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge continued to suffer from radiation exposure. In 1948, he was named the priest at a much larger church in another part of town. He became a Japanese citizen and changed his name to Father Makoto Takakura. He fell into a coma and died on November 19, 1977. There were always fresh flowers on his grave.

Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, who suffered no side effects from the bombing, was haunted by the images of the Red Cross Hospital after the bombing. In 1951, Dr. Sasaki quit working at the Red Cross Hospital. He started his own practice in his hometown and normally performed simple surgeries. He decided to build a geriatric hospital. He continued to regret not keeping better track of all the cremated bodies at the hospital.

Toshiko Sasaki was abandoned by her fiancé after being left crippled. Over a 14-month period she underwent orthopedic surgery to improve the condition of her leg. After working in an orphanage for five years, she became a nun with the Society of the Helpers of Holy Souls. Taking her final vows in 1953, she adopted the name of Sister Dominique. She was quickly noticed for her potential and made a director of the Garden of St. Joseph, an old people&#x27;s home. She retired in 1978 and was rewarded with a trip to the Holy See. She did volunteer work and spent two years as Mother Superior at Misasa, where she had undergone her novitiate.

== Lasting impact ==

The publication of the article placed Hiroshima and the atomic bomb at the heart of the nuclear war debate. In &quot;Hiroshima in History and Memory,&quot; Michael J. Hogan writes that &quot;Hiroshima&quot; created a realization of the magnitude of the event and an entrance into the analysis of the event. It put forward three issues that before had not been faced: the force of modern science, the bomb and the future of nuclear weapons.

The events of the dropping of the atomic bomb live in the psyche of everyone and were brought to gruesome light by Hersey. &quot;Hiroshima&quot; has and will continue to be &quot;part of our ceaseless thinking about world wars and nuclear holocaust&quot;. The effects of the radiation sickness have continued to be a concern for the world and the safety of nuclear power. These concerns have resurfaced since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor incident. The images brought to the public after the publishing of &quot;Hiroshima&quot; were revived in the world&#x27;s eyes.

In his essay &quot;From Yellow Peril to Japanese Wasteland: John Hersey&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima&quot;&quot;, Patrick B. Sharp also saw &quot;Hiroshima&quot; as a counterpoint to &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; fiction like &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, which were &quot;narrated from the point of view of an &#x27;everyman&#x27; who witnesses the invasion of his country first hand. As the narrators struggle to survive, we get to witness the horror of the attack through their eyes, and come to loathe the enemy aliens that have so cruelly and unjustly invaded their country.&quot; While in Yellow Peril fiction scientists and soldiers who defeat the invaders are portrayed as heroes, Hersey portrays Japanese and German clergymen, doctors, and other ordinary citizens as heroes.

Essays on the Red Circle Authors website included &quot;Hiroshima&quot; in the Atomic Bomb Literature cycle. Still, relevant anthologies like &quot;Nihon no Genbaku Bungaku&quot; or &quot;The Crazy Iris and Other Stories of the Atomic Aftermath&quot; are confined solely to Japanese writers. In her 1953 short story &quot;Fireflies&quot;, writer Yōko Ōta, a representative of the Atomic Bomb Literature, repeatedly refers to Hersey&#x27;s report and Dr. Sasaki, whom she calls Dr. X in her story, &quot;the young doctor that John Hersey had written about in &quot;Hiroshima&quot;&quot;.

In 1999, the original article was ranked as the finest piece of American journalism of the 20th century by a panel of experts assembled by New York University&#x27;s journalism department. 

The book was featured on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;A Good Read&quot; in November 2020.

<text>James Calvin Rollins (born November 27, 1978), nicknamed &quot;J-Roll&quot;, is an American former professional baseball shortstop, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies (–), Los Angeles Dodgers (), and Chicago White Sox ().

After growing up in Alameda, California, and attending Encinal High School, Rollins was drafted by the Phillies in the second round of the 1996 MLB draft. After spending most of five seasons with Phillies minor league teams, he made his big league debut on September 17, 2000.

At the major league level, Rollins quickly earned recognition as an excellent defensive shortstop. In , he became the Phillies&#x27; leadoff hitter, a role he retained for almost ten years. Rollins made three All-Star Game appearances in his career. While with the Phillies, he compiled a 38-game hitting streak, which spanned the end of the 2005 season and the start of the 2006 season, the longest in team history. Rollins was named the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in , as the Phillies won their division in the first of five consecutive seasons. He was also a key component of the 2008 World Series champion team that defeated the Tampa Bay Rays.

In his career, Rollins led the NL four times in triples, and once each in runs, stolen bases, and stolen base percentage. As of 2023, he is the Phillies career leader in at bats (8,628), hits (2,306), doubles (479), and power-speed number (292.5), second in games played (2,090) and stolen bases (453), and third in runs scored (1,325), triples (111), and stolen base percentage (82.66). Rollins won the Gold Glove Award four times, as well as the Silver Slugger Award, and the Roberto Clemente Award (once each).

==Family and background==
Rollins grew up in Alameda as a member of an athletic family. His mother played competitive fastpitch softball, and he credits the experience with helping him develop a cerebral approach to the game, as well as a passion for the middle infield. His father was a wrestler and weightlifter. Rollins has been described as having &quot;a near-photographic memory of games and at-bats and pitches&quot;. Rollins&#x27; brother, Antwon, played with minor league affiliates of the Texas Rangers. His sister, Shay Rollins, was a starter on the University of San Francisco&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball team, and he is the cousin of former MLB player Tony Tarasco. Despite the athletes in his family, his father encouraged Rollins to pursue music as well as baseball. Rollins played the trumpet while growing up, and participated in various MC Hammer and Mavis Staples music videos during his adolescent years. Rollins was an Oakland Athletics fan growing up and regularly attended games at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.

In 1996, Rollins graduated from Encinal High School in Alameda. His parents refused to let him continue playing football, instead directing him to focus on baseball. He finished his high school baseball career as the holder of 10 school records, including highest batting average (.484), and most stolen bases (99). For his performance, &quot;USA Today&quot; named him a member of its All-USA High School Baseball Team, and &quot;Baseball America&quot; named him the top infielder in Northern California, as well as a second-team All-American. The American Baseball Coaches Association and Rawlings also named Rollins to their All-America Second Team. He committed to play college baseball at Arizona State University on a scholarship, but after &quot;effusive&quot; praise from Phillies&#x27; Bay Area scout Bob Poole, the team drafted him in the second round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues: 1996–2000===
After being drafted by the Phillies in the second round of the 1996 draft, Rollins was assigned to the rookie-league Martinsville Phillies. He led the team in walks and stole 20 bases, but batted only .238/.351/.285.

However, Rollins still earned a promotion to the low-A Piedmont Boll Weevils for the 1997 season. The youngest player on the team at age 18, he led the team in games played, at-bats, runs (94; 5th in the league), hits (151; 4th), triples (8; tied for 4th), stolen bases (46; 5th), and walks. Rollins batted .270/.330/.370 and had 560 at-bats, over 100 more than second-place Dave Francia. For his performance, he was named a co-winner of the Paul Owens Award, given to the Phillies&#x27; top minor league player. At the end of the season, Rollins played in the Florida Instructional League.

Rollins was promoted to high-A Clearwater in 1998. While playing alongside future Phillies teammates Pat Burrell, Johnny Estrada, Adam Eaton, and Brandon Duckworth, Rollins batted .244/.306/.354 with 18 doubles and 23 stolen bases; once again, he was the youngest player on the team. Eaton, Burrell, and Rollins were all promoted to AA Reading together the next year, and Rollins led the team in games and at-bats, as well as hits. His 145 hits gave him an average of .273, and led to a late-season promotion to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he played four games. In 2000, he led Scranton in games played, doubles, and triples, and helped lead the team to the playoffs.

Rollins received a September call-up to the Phillies. He debuted on September 17 Wearing #29 against the Florida Marlins and had two hits in four at-bats in the game, with his first MLB hit being a triple off of Chuck Smith of the Marlins. He batted .321 in 14 games, stealing three bases and batting in five runs. After the season, &quot;Baseball America&quot; named him the Phillies&#x27; top organizational prospect. He was a finalist for the United States national baseball team to participate in the 2000 Olympics.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
====2001–2004====
Rollins switched uniform numbers from 29 to what would be his permanent uniform number 11, despite wearing number 6 for the 2003 season only. Rollins spent the entire 2001 season with the major league Phillies and hit his first MLB home run on May 2 off of Brian Bohanon of the Colorado Rockies. In his rookie season Rollins led the National League in triples and stolen bases, becoming the first rookie to do so since 1951, and led the NL in at bats. He was a member of the NL all-star team in the 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the Phillies only representative. In July, he took over from Doug Glanville as the Phillies&#x27; leadoff hitter, a role he maintained for nearly a decade. At the conclusion of the season, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum named him the co-winner of the Cool Papa Bell Award, given to the stolen bases leader; MLB managers voted him to the Topps Major League Rookie All-Star team; and &quot;Baseball America&quot; named him the fifth-best rookie in MLB.

Entering the 2002 season, despite his youth, Rollins sought to be a leader in the Phillies&#x27; clubhouse; an article in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said, &quot;Rollins, even at just 23 years old, may now have the clout needed to be a stern voice that makes a difference in the clubhouse and on the field.&quot; Rollins&#x27; season was characterized by a strong first half, and a &quot;sophomore jinx&quot; at the plate that plagued him in the second half of the season. For his performance in the early months of the season, he earned his second consecutive selection to the MLB All-Star game, in doing so becoming the first Phillie and first MLB shortstop ever to reach the game in each of his first two seasons. After the all-star game, however, he struggled at the plate, striking out frequently and chasing many high pitches that were out of the strike zone. Ultimately, Rollins finished the season among the NL leaders in defensive statistics – he compiled a .980 fielding percentage (second in NL), 695 total chances (third in NL), 504 assists (fourth in NL), and 226 putouts (fifth in NL). Meanwhile, offensively, he regressed from his 2001 campaign, batting .245/.306/.380 with 11 home runs, but still leading the NL with 10 triples; he stole 31 bases, 15 fewer than he did in 2001. After the season, he participated in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.

Prior to the 2003 season, he worked with Tony Gwynn on skills at the plate, predominantly using the whole field and being more of a &quot;slap hitter&quot;. However, he began the season slowly, sustaining a hamstring injury in spring training that hindered his progress, and ultimately struggling at the plate early in the season, causing manager Larry Bowa to drop him in the lineup. Throughout the season, he sought to maintain the focus that he admitted to having lost the previous season, and he eventually rebounded to post a &quot;respectable&quot; stat line – a .263/.320/.387 with eight home runs and 62 RBIs, though he stole what at the time was a career-low 20 bases. Among his season highlights were a game-winning RBI against John Smoltz in June, and stealing his 100th career base in September, both of which occurred in games against the Atlanta Braves.

On January 15, Rollins signed a $2.4 million contract with the Phillies to avoid salary arbitration. According to one biography of Rollins,

Overall, he achieved another &quot;quadruple-double&quot; (home runs, stolen bases, doubles, and triples in double figures in a single season), his first career grand slam and posted career highs in a plethora of offensive categories including batting average, slugging percentage, RBIs, and hits.

====2005–2007====
Under new manager Charlie Manuel, whose offensive strategy predominantly revolved around hitting many home runs, Rollins struggled to post a strong batting average early in the Phillies&#x27; 2005 season. Nevertheless, he was again selected to the NL All-Star team. His offensive strategy changed in early August, when he began a hitting streak that spanned the season&#x27;s final 36 games; during the streak, he hit .379. It was the longest hitting streak in Phillies&#x27; history, surpassing Ed Delahanty, whose streak lasted 31 games. Throughout the streak, Rollins aspired to maintain a team-first mentality, and noted that he would trade the streak for a playoff berth: &quot;If we lose and I keep the streak, what does that mean? The season is automatically over. The playoffs is everything. That&#x27;s what we all want.&quot; Ultimately, the Phillies missed the playoffs by one game. Overall, Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple-double, tying Johnny Damon for most among active players, and batted .290/.338/.431 with 12 home runs, 54 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases.

The 2006 Phillies season began with much hype surrounding Rollins, and whether he could extend his hitting streak to pass Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s record 56 games. He extended the streak two games into the season, but it ended on April 6 when he failed to get a hit in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. He struggled during the first half of the season, posting a batting average of just .259, but rebounded during the second half, ultimately posting strong cumulative numbers once again. He became the third player in Phillies&#x27; history to score at least 100 runs in three consecutive seasons (Chuck Klein and Bobby Abreu), and led all NL shortstops in RBIs, runs scored, extra-base hits, and total bases. He was just short, however, of another quadruple-double. Cumulatively, he hit .277/.334/.478 with 25 home runs and 83 RBIs (at the time, the latter two were career-highs) and 36 stolen bases. Once again, the Phillies barely missed the playoffs.

Before spring training, Rollins announced that the Phillies were the &quot;Team to Beat&quot; in the National League East:

It became a sports media sensation, especially given that the New York Mets had won the division in 2006 with relative ease. The claim was widely reported, often without the second part of the quote (&quot;only on paper&quot;). &quot;USA Today&quot; columnist Hal Bodley opined, &quot;The Phillies have needed someone to light a fire, especially in April. Rollins&#x27; bold, if not arrogant, prediction might just do that.&quot; During the first half of the season, it appeared Rollins had spoken prematurely, as the Mets jumped out to an early divisional lead. On June 28, Rollins had a four-hit game against the Cincinnati Reds, including a game-tying triple. The triple was Rollins&#x27; 10th, which gave him his fifth career &quot;quadruple–double&quot;.

In August, the Mets&#x27; lead began to dissipate, as the Phillies combined several solid series; Rollins was a key component of their success. Rollins was named the National League Player of the Week for August 27 to September 2, 2007. On September 25 against the Atlanta Braves, Rollins hit the home run that completed his 30–30 season. On the last day of the 2007 season, Rollins became the seventh player to collect at least 20 doubles, 20 triples, and 20 home runs in one season when he hit his 20th triple of the year in a 6–1 win over the Washington Nationals that clinched the National League East division championship for the Phillies, which confirmed Rollins&#x27; preseason assertion of the Phillies preeminence.

For the 2007 season, he batted .296/.344/.531 and led the league in games (162), at bats (716—a major league record), runs (139), and triples (20), was second in hits (212), total bases (380), extra base hits (88), and power-speed number (34.6), and had 30 home runs, 94 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases (5th in the league). He achieved the &quot;quadruple-double&quot; (double digit doubles, triples, home runs, and stolen bases), becoming the fourth player in history to accomplish the mark. He would join Jim Bottomley as the only players to record a 30 double, 20 triple, and 30 home run season. The club advanced to the playoffs for the first time since their 1993 World Series loss; however, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series.

Rollins was named the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. He also received the NLBM Oscar Charleston Legacy Award (NL MVP), and won the first of three consecutive Gold Glove Awards, becoming the first Phillies shortstop to win a Gold Glove since Larry Bowa in 1978. He was the first player in MLB history to record 200 hits, 20 triples, 30 home runs, and 30 stolen bases in a season. Rollins also set a single-season MLB record for plate appearances with 778.

====2008–2011====

Unlike in spring training 2007, Rollins &quot;made no guarantees heading into the next season, but that didn&#x27;t mean the Phillies weren&#x27;t confident&quot; entering their 2008 season, despite the Mets&#x27; acquisition of Johan Santana and a &quot;2007 Rollins-esque&quot; guarantee of winning the division from Carlos Beltrán. After beginning the season by hitting a home run on opening day, Rollins landed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his career in early April, suffering an ankle sprain. He returned in May, and had a &quot;productive&quot; summer, ultimately posting a career-high 47 stolen bases, notwithstanding his batting average dropping to .277, and his home run and RBI totals dropping to 11 and 59 respectively. In the postseason, Rollins was a focal point of the team, which ultimately won the 2008 World Series; in the division series (NLDS), he hit a leadoff home run in game four, and in the championship series (NLCS), he hit a leadoff home run in game five, and despite struggles early in the World Series, he eventually contributed with strong situational hitting, helping the Phillies win the series in five games. At the conclusion of the season, Rollins was honored with a Fielding Bible Award for defensive excellence as the top MLB shortstop during the year.

Rollins began 2009 by participating in the 2009 World Baseball Classic (WBC) as a member of Team USA; he hit .417 and was named to the all-tournament team. After setting a career high in stolen bases in 2008, he did not steal one in the season&#x27;s first 17 games, his longest drought to begin a season since 2004. On May 21, he reached the 1500-hit milestone in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. As of the end of June, however, he was hitting just .205 (he went 28 consecutive at-bats without a hit from the end of June until July 2), and was benched for four games by Charlie Manuel in an effort to encourage him to regain the shorter, lower half-driven swing that he used in his 2007 MVP campaign. He did improve in the second half of the season, batting .288 from July 3 to the end of the year. Overall, he compiled an NL-leading 672 at-bats, finished fourth in doubles (43) and stolen bases (31), and tenth in runs (100); in addition, he had a .250 batting average, 21 home runs (five of which were leadoff, the most in his career), and 77 RBIs, also winning the National League Gold Glove award for shortstops. In the postseason, he helped the Phillies reach the 2009 World Series by hitting a walk-off double in game four of the NLCS. The Phillies failed to repeat as champions, however, losing to the New York Yankees in six games.

Rollins&#x27;s 2010 season was marked by injuries; he missed a total of 74 games, playing in only 88, the lowest total of his major league career. While warming up in the outfield prior to the Phillies&#x27; game on April 12, he strained his right calf, and eventually was placed on the disabled list. He spent April 13 – May 16, and May 22 – June 21 on the DL with that injury; Wilson Valdez served as his backup. When he returned, he hit his first career walk-off home run on June 23, powering the Phillies to a 7–6 victory over the Cleveland Indians. On July 3, he hit his 150th career home run in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, and on October 1, he hit his third career grand slam in a game against the Atlanta Braves. Overall, he hit .243 with eight home runs and 41 RBIs. He maintained his strong defense despite poor offense, but after his third consecutive mediocre offensive season, some questioned whether his MVP campaign in 2007 was a fluke.

2011 was a contract year for Rollins, and his performance concurrently rebounded, insofar as he improved his batting average, and home run and RBI totals. He made his 11th consecutive opening day start, and, for the first time in several seasons, he was healthy at the beginning of the season, starting the season&#x27;s first 49 games. Nevertheless, it took him 54 plate appearances to record his first RBI, the longest drought of his career. On July 20, for the second time in his career, he had a multi-home run game in which one home run came batting right-handed and the other left-handed, the first Phillies player to do it multiple times. His season was not entirely devoid of injuries; on August 22, a right groin strain landed him on the DL, causing him to miss 18 games. He returned in time for the playoffs, and set several Phillies records in the 2011 NLDS, including hits (9), doubles (4), and multi-hit games (4). Despite the records, the Phillies lost the series to the St. Louis Cardinals. Overall, he posted a .268 batting average with 16 home runs and 63 RBIs. At the season&#x27;s conclusion, Rollins was selected as the shortstop on the &quot;MLB Insiders Club Magazine&quot; All-Postseason Team. On December 17, 2011, Rollins signed a three-year, $33 million deal with a vesting option for a fourth year, worth another $11 million. The option vested when he reached 1,100 plate appearances in 2013–14.

====2012–2014====
In 2012, Rollins epitomized the Phillies&#x27; general &quot;averageness&quot; by posting a .250 batting average with 23 home runs and 68 RBIs. He hit poorly in the beginning of the season, and did not hit a home run until his 136th at bat of the season, the second-longest it had ever taken him to hit a home run at the beginning of a season. He missed three games from May 21–23 for the birth of his first daughter. On July 31, he hit his fourth career inside-the-park home run, which led active players. His hitting improved over the latter half of the season, and in September, he hit eight home runs. He missed the final three games of the season with a calf strain. During the season, he joined Craig Biggio, Barry Larkin, and Paul Molitor as the only players in MLB history to record 2000 hits, 350 stolen bases, and 150 home runs as a member of one team. It was his fourth career season during which he hit at least 20 home runs and stole 30 bases, which trailed only Bobby and Barry Bonds.

Prior to the 2013 season, Rollins played for Team USA in the 2013 World Baseball Classic (WBC), and was the only player from Team USA to make the event&#x27;s all-star team; it was his second WBC, and second placement on the all-star team. He was back to the Phillies in time for opening day, and made his 13th consecutive start on opening day. Overall, he tied for fifth in the NL in games (160), and led the team with 600 at-bats, 151 hits, 36 doubles, and 59 walks. He achieved several career milestones during the season, including his 800th RBI (April 22), his 433 double (breaking Ed Delahanty&#x27;s record on May 15), and his 45th career leadoff home run (fourth most in MLB history; hit on July 20). Despite the achievements, overall, the season was a decline from previous years; his isolated power (ISO) was among the worst in the major leagues, he attempted to steal the fewest bases in his career, and his defense &quot;tanked&quot; according to fielding metrics. He &quot;struggled mightily&quot; and ultimately posted a .252 batting average with six home runs and 39 RBIs.

Rollins attracted media attention in the offseason prior to 2014 when he supposedly expressed disinclination or lack of motivation after commenting &quot;who cares&quot; in regards to spring training; Buster Olney penned a column suggesting that there was a sentiment within the Phillies&#x27; organization that he should be traded (the rumors were dispelled by Rollins and Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. as ridiculous). He opened the season by hitting a grand slam against the Texas Rangers, which was also his 200th career home run. After two games, Rollins left the team on paternity leave to be with his wife as the couple had their second child. On June 14, Rollins singled to right field for his 2,235th hit to surpass Mike Schmidt as the Phillies&#x27; all-time leader in hits. The game paused as Schmidt and the remainder of the Phillies congratulated Rollins at first base. Following the season, Rollins and recently retired Chicago White Sox captain Paul Konerko became the first ever co-winners of the Roberto Clemente Award.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===

On December 19, 2014, Rollins was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for minor league pitchers Tom Windle and Zach Eflin. Rollins waived his no-trade clause and stated that he was expecting to take on a leadership position with his new team.

Rollins played his first game with the Dodgers during opening day against the San Diego Padres on April 6, 2015, hitting a 3-run homer off of Shawn Kelley, giving the Dodgers a 6–3 victory over the Padres. He struggled offensively with the Dodgers, hitting a career low .224 (the lowest batting average among all qualified major league batters)/.285/.358 with 13 homers and 41 RBI. He also stole 12 bases. In September, he lost his starting job to rookie Corey Seager. For the final game of the season, manager Don Mattingly designated Rollins to be the 2015 player manager.

===Chicago White Sox===

On February 22, 2016, Rollins signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox that included an invitation to major league spring training. He competed with Tyler Saladino for a starting role at shortstop. At the end of spring training, the team announced that Rollins would serve as their Opening Day shortstop. Due to Rollins&#x27; familiar number 11 already being retired in honor of Luis Aparicio, Rollins wore number 7 for the White Sox, which the following year would be worn by the man who replaced Rollins at shortstop, Tim Anderson.

Rollins batted .221/.295/.329 with 2 home runs and 5 stolen bases in 41 games for the White Sox. On June 10, he was designated for assignment so the White Sox could promote Tim Anderson from the minor leagues.

===San Francisco Giants===
On December 19, 2016, Rollins signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants that included an invitation to spring training. He was released on March 31, 2017.

==Post-playing career==
In 2019, Rollins returned to the Phillies in two separate capacities: in January, as a special advisor for the team; and in March, as an on-air commentator for their television broadcasts. On May 4, 2019, a retirement ceremony honoring Rollins was held at Citizens Bank Park; the Phillies have not retired Rollins&#x27; uniform number 11, although it has not been reissued since he wore it.

After advising the team since 2019, the Phillies announced on March 31, 2022, that Rollins had been named a special advisor to the president of baseball operations.

==Player profile==
===Career statistics===
Rollins, at his retirement, was one of 19 ballplayers to have recorded 2,000 games at the shortstop position and was the only shortstop to have amassed 200 homers and 400 steals. He was 20th all-time among MLB players in career power-speed number (309.8), 31st in stolen base percentage (81.74), 42nd in assists (6,139), and 46th in stolen bases (470). In his career, he led the National League four times in triples, and once each in runs, stolen bases, and stolen base percentage. 

, he was the Phillies career leader in at bats (8,628), hits (2,306), doubles (479), and power-speed number (292.5), second in games played (2,090) and stolen bases (453), and third in runs (1,325), triples (111), and stolen base percentage (82.66).

===Offense===
Growing up, Rollins admired Rickey Henderson, one of the best leadoff hitters in MLB history, and especially early in his career, he sought to emulate Henderson at the plate. This contributed to his propensity to swing early in the count, and chase high pitches, seeking to hit home runs rather than get on base, the stereotypical role of a leadoff hitter. Consequently, he struggled to make contact with the ball, striking out too much, and rarely walking. To help alleviate those predominantly negative tendencies, he worked with Tony Gwynn prior to the 2003 season on using the whole field, and hitting more ground balls than pop-ups. Overall, he &quot;always had a hard time accepting that he is vertically challenged at 5-foot-8&quot;, which contributed to his inclination to strive to hit for power rather than contact, and to seek to pull the ball rather than use the whole field. Rollins is the Phillies all-time leader in hits, and has the second-most stolen bases in Phillies history.

===Defense===
A &quot;supreme defensive shortstop&quot;, Rollins won four Gold Glove Awards, and only Omar Vizquel has a better fielding percentage among shortstops who played at least 10 seasons. Rollins attributes some of his defensive prowess to experience, noting that he played in MLB for a long enough time to know most hitters&#x27; tendencies and to learn how to read swings, both of which helped him appropriately position himself to get to as many balls as possible. In their 2011 season preview, &quot;Lindy&#x27;s Sports&quot; commented that Rollins was an upper-echelon shortstop &quot;with soft hands, excellent agility and plus range left and right&quot; and praised his strong throwing arm, especially from the hole.

===Hall of Fame===
Rollins was included on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame class of when it was announced on November 22, 2021. He received Hall of Fame votes on 9.4% of the ballots in his first year of eligibility, falling well short of election to the Hall of Fame. In 2023, this percentage rose to 12.9%.

==Personal life==
Rollins resides in the Tampa, Florida, area and is married to Johari Smith. They were married on January 23, 2010, in the Cayman Islands. On May 21, 2012, Johari gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first daughter, Camryn Drew Rollins. Their second daughter, Logan Aliya, was born in early April 2014. When he played for the Phillies, Rollins resided in Woolwich Township, New Jersey. Osiris Johnson, a cousin of Rollins, is also a baseball player, and was drafted in the second round, 37th overall in the 2018 draft by the Miami Marlins.

An active philanthropist, Rollins and his wife Johari have participated in several charitable endeavors including the creation of The Johari &amp; Jimmy Rollins Center for Animal Rehabilitation, which is located in Woolwich Township, New Jersey, and provides several medical rehabilitation services for animals and an annual BaseBOWL charity bowling tournament to benefit the Arthritis Foundation. Rollins is also active politically and campaigned for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. In 2020, he supported Bernie Sanders for president.

<text>Alistair Murdoch McCoist (; born 24 September 1962) is a Scottish former footballer who has since worked as a manager and TV pundit.

McCoist began his playing career with Scottish club St Johnstone, before moving to English side Sunderland in 1981. He returned to his homeland two years later, signing with Rangers. McCoist had a highly successful career with Rangers, becoming the club&#x27;s record goalscorer and winning nine successive league championships between 1988–89 and 1996–97. He later played for Kilmarnock.

McCoist was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. He is also a member of the Scottish Football Hall of Fame, having gained 61 international caps. A prolific striker, he is the fifth-highest all-time goalscorer in the top tier of the Scottish football league system, having scored 260 times for Rangers and Kilmarnock between 1983 and 2001.

Towards the end of his playing career, McCoist started his media career. Between 1996 and 2007, he was a team captain on the BBC sports quiz &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;. He began to scale back his media commitments in 2007, when he became an assistant manager to Walter Smith at Rangers. He succeeded Smith as Rangers manager in 2011, but the club then suffered from serious financial difficulties. Rangers went into liquidation in 2012 and the club was placed in the fourth tier of Scottish league football. McCoist helped them win successive promotions to the second tier, but after a poor start to the 2014–15 season McCoist handed in his 12-months&#x27; notice in December 2014 and was placed on gardening leave. In September 2015, McCoist and Rangers mutually agreed to terminate his contract.

==Early life==
Born at Bellshill Maternity Hospital and raised in East Kilbride, McCoist attended Maxwellton Primary and Hunter High School. His high-school team coach and chemistry teacher was former Clyde and Scotland forward Archie Robertson, who was acknowledged by McCoist for his guidance and influence, but who died in 1978 just as his protégé&#x27;s career was taking off. Upon leaving school, McCoist had a short spell working as a clerical assistant in the Overseas Development Agency (now the Department for International Development) branch office at Hairmyres. The role offered flexible working arrangements, allowing him to organise his hours around his football career.

==Playing career==
=== St Johnstone ===
McCoist&#x27;s first professional club was St Johnstone, having signed from Fir Park Boys Club in 1978. He had been denied a move to St Mirren because Alex Ferguson thought he was not good enough. &quot;When I was 14, 15, Sir Alex used to pick me up from school. I used to go to Hunter High in East Kilbride, and he stayed up in Greenhills, I think it was, in East Kilbride. And he used to pick me up – myself and another lad, Stevie Cowan, who he &quot;did&quot; sign at St Mirren and went to Aberdeen with him. We&#x27;d train with the S-forms, and Sir Alex would take the training with the first team and the reserves. And then Stevie and I would wait, and Sir Alex would give us a couple of quid and we&#x27;d nip round to the chippie in Love Street. We&#x27;d go back and wait for Sir Alex finishing, and then he would drop us off at the house.&quot;

McCoist made his debut for St Johnstone on 7 April 1979 in a 3–0 win over Raith Rovers. He did not score his first goal for the club until he scored Saints&#x27; final goal in a 3–0 win against Dumbarton in August 1980. He went on to score 23 goals in 43 appearances that season, including a consolation against Rangers in a 3–1 defeat in a Scottish Cup replay.

Due to his form with both St Johnstone and the Scotland under-18 side, McCoist gained the attention of several English clubs, including Sunderland, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Middlesbrough and Tottenham Hotspur.

He started the 1981–82 season with four goals in five League Cup games, including the opening goal in a 2–0 win over Celtic at Muirton Park and the consolation in a 4–1 defeat in the corresponding fixture at Parkhead.

=== Sunderland ===
Sunderland manager Alan Durban signed McCoist in August 1981. The £400,000 transfer fee spent on the striker made him Sunderland&#x27;s record signing. McCoist&#x27;s time at Sunderland was unsuccessful, however: he scored nine goals in 65 appearances for a side struggling at the foot of the English First Division. He managed two goals during the 1981–82 season, his first coming against Nottingham Forest and his second a curling effort from the edge of the box against Southampton.

Three goals in three pre-season games against Dundee, Dunfermline Athletic and former team St Johnstone were followed by a goal against European champions Aston Villa on the opening day of the 1982–83 season in a 3–1 win. He followed this up with a goal against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, meaning he had matched his previous season&#x27;s tally midway through September.

October 1982 proved to be the highlight of McCoist&#x27;s spell with Sunderland, as he scored five goals in as many games against Norwich City, Southampton, Manchester City, Everton and Wolverhampton Wanderers. With seven goals scored by the end of October, McCoist failed to score another goal in a Sunderland shirt. Despite this, he finished third-top scorer for Sunderland in 1982–83, one goal behind Nick Pickering.

In early 1983, Alan Durban invited McCoist into his office and informed him that Rangers&#x27; John Greig had called him with an interest in signing the player. &quot;He said, &#x27;Do you fancy it?&#x27;&quot; recalled McCoist. &quot;And I said, &#x27;Aye. I&#x27;ve got to be honest with you.&#x27; He said, &#x27;I think you should go, for the simple fact that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be here in three or four months.&#x27; Sure enough, he got the sack relatively soon after that.&quot;

=== Rangers ===
At the end of the 1982–83 season, McCoist returned to Scotland and joined Rangers for a fee of £185,000. On his dream move, McCoist recalled: &quot;I met John Greig and Tommy McLean at the Crest Hotel, at the roundabout in Carlisle. I went to a payphone and phoned my wee grannie in Thornliebank. First person I phoned. I can still hear her – obviously not with us now – but I can still hear her voice down the phone. You could have given her a million pounds and it wouldn&#x27;t have meant just as much.&quot;

During his fifteen years with Rangers, McCoist achieved an array of honours, including ten league championship medals. This began with a title in the 1986–87 season and included the whole &quot;Nine in a Row&quot; period between 1989 and 1997. He also won a Scottish Cup winner&#x27;s medal and nine Scottish League Cup winner&#x27;s medals. He was the first player to be Europe&#x27;s top goalscorer twice in a row (in 1992 and 1993), and in 1992 won Scottish football&#x27;s two most prestigious Player of the Year awards.

McCoist made his competitive debut for the Ibrox side against St Mirren on the opening day of the 1983–84 season, and scored twenty goals that year. Nonetheless, he got a tough time from the supporters. &quot;When I look back, do I regret it? No, because it actually made me stronger. If I didn&#x27;t handle that at all, I wouldn&#x27;t have stayed at the club and I would have been away down the road. At that time, Jock Wallace probably would have sold me.&quot; McCoist scored a hat-trick in the League Cup final victory over Celtic in March 1984. With Rangers still a team very much in the doldrums, he managed 18 goals the following season.

McCoist scored 24 goals in the 1985–86 season. He made his international debut against the Netherlands in 1986, the same year Graeme Souness arrived at Rangers to begin the Ibrox revolution. &quot;He certainly transformed Rangers Football Club, but he also transformed Scottish football,&quot; said McCoist of Souness&#x27; time at Ibrox. &quot;Two of his first three signings were Terry Butcher, the England captain, and Chris Woods, the England goalkeeper. The whole place just erupted into a new level.&quot;

McCoist scored another hat-trick in the Glasgow Cup final against Celtic to bring further accolades his way, and he was an ever-present in Rangers&#x27; title-winning side of 1987, scoring 34 goals along the way.

In September 1987 McCoist was convicted of assault and fined £150 at Hamilton Sheriff Court. This followed an attack on a 19-year-old outside an East Kilbride nightclub in the early hours of 5 December 1986. A verdict of not proven was returned against Ted McMinn and Iain Durrant in relation to the incident. McCoist and Durrant were each fined £1,500 by Rangers.

McCoist&#x27;s tally of 31 goals in 1987–88 could not prevent Celtic regaining the league title and, although Rangers recaptured their crown in 1988–89, McCoist played only 19 games. That title win was the first of nine-in-a-row, but McCoist found himself in and out of the first team for the first three of those successes. During the 1990–91 season, Mo Johnston and new signing Mark Hateley were the preferred front pairing, and when McCoist attended the Cheltenham Festival when the players were given free time prior to back-to-back games against Celtic, he was dropped from the match squad by Souness and forced to apologise, for breaching team discipline, in a press conference. He returned to the team for the second of the matches after Hateley was sent off in the first, but Rangers lost both without scoring and his future at the club seemed uncertain.

When Walter Smith took over from Souness in April 1991, McCoist returned to the fore and came back from a hernia on the final day of the season as the club won the title. Despite starting the next season on the bench due to further minor injuries, McCoist won both the Players&#x27; Player of the Year and the Sportswriters&#x27; awards. During this 1991–92 campaign, he scored 34 times in the league, forming an effective partnership with Hateley (Johnston had since left the club) as Rangers completed a domestic double. Those goals won him the European Golden Boot – the first time a Scot had won the award – ensuring his position with two long-range strikes in the final fixture of the season away to Aberdeen, a match he later admitted he had barely been in a condition to play, having spent the previous night drinking with students in the team hotel. He had scored the only goal of the Scottish Cup semi-final, an Old Firm meeting in which Rangers played 85 minutes with only ten men, and rounded off the season with the decisive goal in the 1992 Scottish Cup final. Regarding the Golden Boot, McCoist joked: &quot;There was some wee Romanian guy. You know what it&#x27;s like: I think he needed to score nine in the last game of the season to beat me. I think he got eight. It was one of those ones. I think he scored his seventh in the 98th minute and scored his eighth in the 114th minute. You&#x27;re never sure with that mob.&quot;

He repeated that scoring feat a year later, in 1992–93, with the same goal tally in the Premier Division, despite missing the last seven matches of the season after breaking his leg playing for Scotland against Portugal in April. He also missed the 1993 Scottish Cup final (having scored the winner in the semi-final to put Rangers through) but still scored a career-best 49 goals from 52 appearances overall for the campaign.

After a six-month absence, he returned from the injury by coming off the bench to score an overhead kick to win the 1993 Scottish League Cup final against Hibernian.

As for McCoist&#x27;s renowned strike partnership with Hateley, the Englishman said: &quot;Alistair was the perfect partner for me. As a finisher, he was an unbelievable goal scorer. He linked with me. All the goal scorer does is he looks at the leader of the line and makes sure he&#x27;s offset, fifteen yards away. It was a great partnership&quot;

His appearances were limited over the next two seasons as a result of other niggling injuries (37 games and 12 goals, less than his typical output for one campaign), and also had to compete with a string of new signings between 1993 and 1995, including Gordon Durie and Brian Laudrup, for the forward positions.

After recovering his fitness, he played more regularly in the 1995–96 season, scoring 16 league goals and in an Old Firm Scottish Cup semi-final victory (as he had done in 1992 and would again in 1998), though he again missed the resulting final. A tenth Premier Division winner&#x27;s medal (the completion of nine-in-a-row) and a ninth League Cup win (scoring twice) followed in 1996–97. His last appearance in a Rangers jersey came in the 1998 Scottish Cup final in which he scored during a 2–1 defeat by Heart of Midlothian.

At Rangers, McCoist became the club&#x27;s record goalscorer, netting 355 goals in all competitions. In addition to this, he holds the club record for number of league goals scored and the number of Scottish League Cup goals scored (with 251 and 54, respectively). He also held the title for the most goals scored by a player in European competitions (21), until his total was overtaken by Alfredo Morelos. McCoist is also third in the all-time appearance table for Rangers, having made 581 appearances for the club.

Reflecting on his time at Rangers in 2018, McCoist said: &quot;My extended family was those boys that I worked with and played with and coached and managed and worked under. It was the greatest experience of my life and I was very, very privileged to play there, coach there and manage there. It was a dream come true.&quot;

=== Kilmarnock ===
McCoist finished his career at Kilmarnock, where he spent three seasons alongside long-time Rangers teammate Ian Durrant. After recovering from another broken leg in 1999 (sustained in a match against Rangers) during the last months of his &quot;Killie&quot; spell, he was an unused substitute in the 2001 Scottish League Cup final defeat to Celtic, then had a penalty saved by Stefan Klos at Rugby Park in what proved to be his final match against his old club. He was denied a cameo appearance from the bench at Ibrox by his manager Bobby Williamson a few weeks later as Kilmarnock were already losing heavily – instead he received an ovation from supporters on the field after the final whistle.

His final game at the age of 38 was at home to Celtic on the last day of the SPL campaign on 20 May 2001, a 1–0 win which enabled Kilmarnock to qualify for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup. Coincidentally, McCoist was substituted off in that match while fellow striker Kris Boyd came off the bench to make his debut; he too went on to be become the club&#x27;s joint-second league goalscorer of all time, level with Eddie Morrison on 121 goals.

===International===
====Age-group teams====
McCoist appeared ten times for the Scotland national under-18 football team. He made his debut in a European Under-18 Championship qualifier against Iceland, netting the only goal of the game after 19 minutes. He followed this up by scoring in the return leg, a 3–1 victory which secured Scotland&#x27;s qualification for the following summer&#x27;s European Under-18 Championships.

He found the net again in his third appearance, a 3–1 victory over Northern Ireland. His next three appearances came in the prestigious Monaco Youth Tournament, a 1–0 defeat to West Germany, a 2–0 victory over Switzerland and a 1–1 draw with France taking his tally to five goals in six appearances.

McCoist was then selected for Scotland&#x27;s semi-professional side for a four-team tournament in the Netherlands; however, he failed to make an appearance.

At the European Under-18 finals, Scotland found themselves in a group with Austria, Spain and defending Under-18 champions England. McCoist started all three games as Scotland defeated both Austria and England 1–0, with McCoist netting the winner against the Auld Enemy, meaning the final group game against the Spanish would decide the group. McCoist scored with a free-kick in a 1–1 draw. This result saw Scotland eliminated on goal-difference.

====Full team====
McCoist made his Scotland debut, aged 23, on 29 April 1986 in a goalless friendly match against the Netherlands.

He started one game at the 1990 World Cup in Italy (coming on as a late substitute in the other group games) after being an integral part of the qualification bid.

In March 1993, he broke a leg against Portugal in a disastrous qualifying match for the next World Cup (Scotland lost 5–0 and failed to progress).

He captained Scotland once, against Australia on 27 March 1996. He went on to score the winner after 55 minutes in a 1–0 win at Hampden Park.

McCoist scored one major tournament goal: a long-range drive at UEFA Euro 1996 against Switzerland, which was also his last goal for his country; he had started all three of Scotland&#x27;s matches at UEFA Euro 1992 but failed to score, and was not selected in the squad for the 1998 World Cup despite having scored 16 goals during the preceding season. &quot;I was devastated. It broke my heart. It really did. I remember getting the news down in London that Craig Brown] wasn&#x27;t taking me and I greeted my eyes out. I still think it was a massive mistake. I certainly don&#x27;t think I would have played ninety minutes in all the games, but if we&#x27;d needed a goal, I was still probably our best chance. That was the biggest disappointment in my career, not going. Obviously I have spoken to Craig since, and he admits it was a mistake now. And I do appreciate him for saying that. It doesn&#x27;t soften the blow that I didn&#x27;t go, but it backs my own theory up that I &quot;should&quot; have gone.&quot;

He made his last two appearances for Scotland after moving from Rangers to Kilmarnock in summer 1998, with his final outing a 3–2 victory over Estonia in October of that year. McCoist is Scotland&#x27;s fifth-highest scorer, with 19 goals from his 61 caps.

==Managerial career==
McCoist joined the Scotland coaching staff under his former manager at Rangers, Walter Smith, in 2004. He turned down the managerial position at Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2006 as he wanted a job nearer his Glasgow home.

===Rangers===

====Smith&#x27;s assistant (2007–11)====
McCoist returned to Rangers as an assistant manager to Walter Smith in January 2007. After Rangers&#x27; victory over Queen of the South in the 2008 Scottish Cup final, Smith revealed that McCoist had been in charge of the team for the entire cup campaign. &quot;Obviously, Walter had me in mind for the manager&#x27;s position when he stepped down, and for a couple of the Scottish Cup runs he let me take the team. I&#x27;d do the preparation and the training, but obviously he&#x27;d be there. I&#x27;d do the team talk, all that kind of stuff.&quot;

The duo also guided Rangers to the final of that year&#x27;s UEFA Cup, in which they lost 2–0 to Zenit Saint Petersburg.

On 22 February 2011 he was announced as the new Rangers manager, with effect from June 2011.

====2011–12 season====
Businessman Craig Whyte bought out Sir David Murray as Rangers&#x27; majority shareholder in May 2011. Whyte said he was proud to be the owner of Rangers and pledged to invest £25 million into transfers, over five years.

McCoist&#x27;s first competitive game in charge of Rangers came on 23 July 2011, a 1–1 draw at home to Hearts on the opening day of the 2011–12 SPL. After the game McCoist complained to BBC Scotland about a report that he argued misrepresented his view on violence after Old Firm derbies and the cost of policing the matches. The BBC stood by the report but upheld the complaint about the way the piece had been edited. On Tuesday 26 July 2011, the BBC issued an apology to McCoist and he, in turn, dropped his ban on speaking to them. In April 2011, McCoist had called for Rangers supporters who sung offensive chants to be arrested.

McCoist took charge of his first European game on 26 July 2011 at home to Swedish side Malmö FF in the first leg of a UEFA Champions League third round qualifier, losing 1–0 to suffer his first defeat as Rangers manager. His first win came on 30 July, away to St Johnstone with a 2–0 scoreline, goals coming from Nikica Jelavić and Steven Naismith. McCoist&#x27;s first Champions League campaign ended at the first hurdle after drawing 1–1 away to Malmo in the Third qualifying round second leg, losing 2–1 on aggregate and having Madjid Bougherra and Steven Whittaker sent off. Despite dropping into the Europa League, McCoist&#x27;s first European campaign as Rangers manager ended early after another defeat over two legs in the play-off round by NK Maribor.

McCoist made a promising start to his first SPL campaign as manager, with Rangers topping the SPL after the first five fixtures and conceding only one goal. His first Old Firm match as manager was a 4–2 win over Celtic at Ibrox, but his side were shocked by First Division side Falkirk in the League Cup a few days later. McCoist suffered a fourth cup competition exit of the season on 5 February 2012, in a 2–0 defeat at home to Dundee United in the Scottish Cup fifth round.

Despite being within four points of Celtic at the top of the table in February, having been fifteen points clear of their arch rivals at one stage, Rangers&#x27; SPL title challenge was virtually ended after the club entered administration on 14 February 2012 and was docked ten points as a consequence. McCoist was able to see out the season with Rangers finishing in second place despite the points deduction.

====2012–13 season====
Following the rejection of a company voluntary arrangement by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the business and assets of the company running Rangers were sold to a consortium led by Charles Green. McCoist decided to stay after talks with Green. McCoist then worked alongside Green as the club were placed in the Scottish Third Division.

Rangers won the Third Division championship and promotion to the third tier. They exited the Scottish Challenge Cup by losing to Queen of the South in a penalty shoot-out. They defeated Motherwell in the League Cup, but lost 3–0 to Inverness in the quarter-finals at Ibrox. Rangers also suffered a 3–0 defeat in the Scottish Cup, against Dundee United at Tannadice.

====2013–14 season====
Rangers won the Scottish League One championship and promotion to the second tier, as they became the first Rangers side in 115 years to go an entire league season unbeaten. They also progressed to the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup, but lost 3–1 to Dundee United at Ibrox. Rangers reached the 2014 Scottish Challenge Cup final, but lost 1–0 after extra time to Raith Rovers at Easter Road. They suffered a first-round defeat in the Scottish League Cup at Forfar Athletic.

====2014–15 season====
Rangers fell behind Hearts in the 2014–15 Scottish Championship as they lost 2–1 at home and 2–0 away to the Edinburgh club. Rangers progressed to the semi-finals of the 2014–15 Scottish League Cup, but suffered a defeat in the 2014–15 Scottish Challenge Cup against Alloa Athletic. McCoist submitted formal notice of his intention to resign as manager in December 2014 and began serving a 12-month notice period. Later in December, McCoist left his position with Rangers and was placed on gardening leave. This continued until September 2015, when McCoist and Rangers agreed to terminate his contract.

==Media career==
McCoist is also known for his television work. He was a team captain on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; from 1996 to 2007 with his rival captains being John Parrott, Frankie Dettori and Matt Dawson, making a record 363 appearances on the show. Having been passed over for Scotland&#x27;s 1998 World Cup squad, McCoist was recruited to the BBC&#x27;s punditry team for the tournament, where he proved a popular addition.

He also co-presented a late night chat show &quot;McCoist and MacAulay&quot; for BBC Scotland from 1998 to 1999 alongside comedian Fred MacAulay. In 2001, McCoist won Sports Presenter of the Year at the TRIC Awards.

In 2000, McCoist also starred in the film &quot;A Shot at Glory&quot; alongside Robert Duvall, playing Jackie McQuillan, a fictional legendary ex-Celtic player. McCoist wore a Rangers jersey under his Celtic one to keep the material off his skin.

Between 1998 and 2005, McCoist, along with John Motson, appeared as a commentator for the &quot;FIFA&quot; video games series by EA Sports. They were replaced by Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray for &quot;FIFA 06&quot;.

McCoist has been a regular pundit for ITV Sport&#x27;s football coverage. In 2010, he was a regular co-commentator for ESPN at the 2010 World Cup working alongside Martin Tyler or Derek Rae. McCoist worked for ITV during the 2018 World Cup, and his partnership with main commentator Jon Champion was praised by various media sources.

From the start of the 2017–18 season McCoist worked as a studio pundit for BT Sport&#x27;s coverage of the SPFL and the Scottish League Cup, appearing regularly on their coverage alongside Darrell Currie, Chris Sutton and Stephen Craigan. From the 2020–21 season, Sky Sports earned exclusive rights to the SPFL, and McCoist continued to feature as a pundit on their coverage.

Since the 2019–20 season he has also been a pundit and commentator for Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s coverage of English Premier League matches.

==Awards==
On 10 June 1994, McCoist was awarded the Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to football. He was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2007 and is also a member of the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. McCoist was inducted into the Scotland national football team roll of honour in March 1996, when he was awarded his 50th international cap. McCoist was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for services to association football and to broadcasting.

==Personal life==
A lifelong Rangers fan, McCoist attended his first Old Firm fixture as a ten-year-old on 5 May 1973. It was Rangers&#x27; 3–2 Scottish Cup final victory in front of 122,714 spectators at Hampden Park.

McCoist&#x27;s first wife was Allison. After meeting in 1981, they married in 1990 and divorced in 2004. The marriage produced three sons: Alexander, Argyll and Mitchell. He has two more sons, Arran and Harris, with his second wife, Vivien. Argyll is a semi-professional footballer who (as of 2025) plays for Drumchapel United.

In 1996, McCoist was convicted of drink driving.

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, McCoist was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

McCoist had an extramarital affair with the actress Patsy Kensit, which was cited in divorce proceedings from his first wife. It is said the affair developed from a pre-existing friendship when McCoist was in London filming ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Premiership&quot; football highlights show.

In November 2024, McCoist revealed he has Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture, a genetic disorder that causes a person&#x27;s fingers to bend towards their palm.

<text>Elaine Cunningham (born August 12, 1957 in New York City) is an American fantasy and science fiction author, especially known for her contributions to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role playing game campaign setting of Forgotten Realms.

==Biography==
Cunningham was born in New York City, and grew up in New York state and New England. A voracious reader since childhood, she earned a degree in music education with a minor in history.

She started writing in 1987, after her older son was born. A lifelong fascination with folklore and mythology led her to the fantasy genre, and her background in music and history gave her an affinity for bards such as Danilo Thann, created for her first novel, &quot;Elfshadow&quot; (1991). Many of her stories focus on elves, which she attributes to her excessive fondness for cats.

Cunningham is also the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author of &quot;Dark Journey&quot;, book 10 from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; saga. &quot;Shadows in the Starlight&quot; (2006), the second book the &quot;Changeling Detective&quot; series, was named to the 2006 &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; list “Ten Best SciFi Novels.&quot;

===Personal life===
Now a full-time arts administrator, Cunningham continues to write, albeit mostly in the early morning hours. She lives in coastal Rhode Island.

<doc id="838464" wikidata="Q3091058" url="?curid=838464" title="Herb Caen">
<text>Herbert Eugene Caen (; April 3, 1916 February 1, 1997) was a San Francisco humorist and journalist whose daily column of local goings-on and insider gossip, social and political happenings, and offbeat puns and anecdotes—&quot;A continuous love letter to San Francisco&quot;—appeared in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; for almost sixty years (excepting a relatively brief defection to &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;) and made him a household name throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.

&quot;The secret of Caen&#x27;s success&quot;, wrote the editor of a rival publication, was:
A special Pulitzer Prize called him the &quot;voice and conscience&quot; of San Francisco.

==Early life and career==

Herbert Eugene Caen was born April 3, 1916, in Sacramento, California, to a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother, but he liked to point out that his parentspool hall operator Lucien Caen and Augusta (Gross) Caenhad spent the summer nine months previous at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. After high school (where he wrote a column titled &quot;Corridor Gossip&quot;) Caen covered sports for &quot;The Sacramento Union&quot;; in later years he occasionally referred to himself as &quot;the Sacamenna Kid.&quot;

In 1936, Caen began writing a radio programming column for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. When that column was discontinued in 1938, Caen proposed a daily column on the city itself; &quot;It&#x27;s News to Me&quot; first appeared July 5. Excepting Caen&#x27;s four years in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and a 19501958 stint at &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, his column appeared every day except Saturday until 1990, when it dropped to five times per week&quot;more than 16,000 columns of 1,000 words each ... an astounding and unduplicated feat, by far the longest-running newspaper column in the country.&quot;

A colleague wrote in 1996:
Caen had considerable influence on popular culture, particularly its language. He coined the term &quot;beatnik&quot; in 1958 and popularized &quot;hippie&quot; during San Francisco&#x27;s 1967 Summer of Love. He popularized obscureoften playfulterms such as &quot;Frisbeetarianism&quot;, and ribbed nearby Berkeley as &quot;Berserkeley&quot; for its often-radical politics. His many recurring if irregular features included &quot;Namephreaks&quot;people with names &quot;(aptronyms)&quot; peculiarly appropriate or inappropriate to their vocations or avocations, such as
substitute teacher Mr. Fillin, hospital spokesman Pam Talkington, periodontist Dr. Rott, piano teacher Patience Scales, orthopedic specialist Dr. Kneebone, and the Vatican&#x27;s spokesman on the evils of rock &#x27;n roll, Cardinal Rapsong.

Among the colorful personalities making periodic appearances in Caen&#x27;s columns was Edsel Ford Fung, whose local reputation as &quot;the world&#x27;s rudest waiter&quot; was due in no small part to Caen, who lamented his death in 1984:

Although Caen relied on &quot;an army of reliable tipsters,&quot; all items were fact-checked.

Now and then an item (usually a joke or pun) was credited to a mysterious &quot;Strange de Jim,&quot; whose first contribution (&quot;Since I didn&#x27;t believe in reincarnation in any of my other lives, why should I have to believe in it in this one?&quot;) appeared in 1972. 
Sometimes suspected to be a Caen alter ego, de Jim (whose letters bore no return address, and who met Caen only onceby chance) was revealed after Caen&#x27;s death to be a Castro District writer who, despite several coy interviews with the press, remains publicly anonymous.

Caen took special pleasure in &quot;seeing what he could sneak by his editorshis &#x27;naughties, such as this item about a shopper looking for a Barbie doll:
Does Barbie with Ken?&#x27; he asked the perky saleswoman. &#x27;Actually no,&#x27; she answered slyly. &#x27;Barbie comes with G.I. Joeshe fakes it with Ken.

On Sundays, current items were set aside in favor of &quot;Mr. San Francisco&#x27;s&quot; reflections on his unconditional love for his adopted city, musing on (for example): 

An occasional column was given over to serious matters, such as a May 1, 1960, piece on the upcoming execution of Caryl Chessman, which included Caen&#x27;s recollection of witnessing a hanging as a young reporter:
On December 12, 1960, Caen wrote:

Powers received almost a hundred cards, most from the San Francisco Bay Area.

In many articles, Caen would write about local San Francisco Bay Area topics such as local mansions and restaurants.

A collection of essays, &quot;Baghdad-by-the-Bay&quot; (a term he&#x27;d coined to reflect San Francisco&#x27;s exotic multiculturalism) was published in 1949, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Call It Frisco&quot;after a local judge&#x27;s 1918 rebuke to an out-of-town petitioner (&quot;No one refers to San Francisco by that title except people from Los Angeles&quot;)appeared in 1953.
&quot;The Cable Car and the Dragon&quot;, a children&#x27;s picture book, was published in 1972.
In 1993, he told an interviewer that he declined to retire because &quot;my name wouldn&#x27;t be in the paper and I wouldn&#x27;t know if I was dead or alive,&quot; adding that his obituary would be his last column: &quot;It will trail off at the end, where I fall face down on the old Royal with my nose on the &#x27;I&#x27; key.&quot;

== Honors and death ==
In April 1996 Caen received a special Pulitzer Prize (which he called his Pullet Surprise) for &quot;extraordinary and continuing contribution as a voice and conscience of his city.&quot; (Fellow &quot;Chronicle&quot; columnist Art Hoppe, who had sworn an oath with Caen twenty-five years earlier not to accept a Pulitzer, released him from the oath without being asked.)
The following month
doctors treating him for pneumonia discovered he had inoperable lung cancer.
He told his readers: &quot;In a lightning flash I passed from the world of the well to the world of the unwell, where I hope to dwell for what I hope is a long time. The point is not to be maudlin or Pollyanna cheerful. This is serious stuff.&quot;

June 14, 1996, was officially celebrated in San Francisco as Herb Caen Day.
After a motorcade and parade ending at the Ferry Building, Caen was honored by &quot;a pantheon of the city&#x27;s movers, shakers, celebrities and historical figures&quot; including television news legend Walter Cronkite. Noting that several San Francisco mayors (sitting or retired) were at liberty to attend, Caen quipped, &quot;Obviously, the Grand Jury hasn&#x27;t been doing its job.&quot;

Among other honors a promenade along the city&#x27;s historic bayfront Embarcadero was christened
—a reference to what Caen called his &quot;three-dot journalism&quot; for the ellipses separating his column&#x27;s short items.
This was particularly appropriate given the recent demolition of an eyesore against which Caen had long campaigned: the elevated Embarcadero Freeway, built astride the Embarcadero forty years earlier and derided by Caen as &quot;The Dambarcadero.&quot; A tribute was inserted in the Congressional Record.

Caen continued to write, though less frequently. He died February 1, 1997. His funeralheld at Grace Cathedral despite his Jewish heritage
(&quot;the damndest saddest, most wonderful funeral anyone ever had, but the only man who could properly describe it isn&#x27;t here,&quot; said close friend and local nightclub owner Enrico Banducci)
was followed by a candlelight procession to Aquatic Park, where his will had provided for a fireworks display—climaxed by a pyrotechnic image of the manual typewriter he had long called his &quot;Loyal Royal&quot;.

&quot;No other newspaper columnist ever has been so long synonymous with a specific place... Part of his appeal seemed to lie in the endless bonhomie he projected,&quot; said his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, comparing him to Walter Winchell &quot;but with the malice shorn off.&quot;

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; projected a one-fifth decline in subscriptions—surveys had shown that Caen was better-read than the front page. Reprints of his columns remain a periodic feature of the &quot;Chronicle.&quot;

<doc id="838465" wikidata="Q7085445" url="?curid=838465" title="Old World Wisconsin">
<text>Old World Wisconsin is an open-air museum located near Eagle, in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. It depicts housing and the daily life of settlers in 19th-century Wisconsin, with separate areas representing the traditions of different ethnic groups who settled in the state. Costumed interpreters portray the occupations and chores of typical settlers of the time.

==Overview==
Opened in 1976, the museum is owned and operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society. The largest outdoor museum of rural life in the United States, it encompasses approximately 480 acres (2.4 km2) of rolling wooded hills. It is adjacent to the Kettle Moraine State Forest South Unit. It contains more than 60 historic structures, ranging from ethnic farmsteads with furnished houses and rural outbuildings to an 1880s crossroads village with traditional small town institutions. Ramsey barn contains a gift shop, the historically inspired Brewhouse demonstrates historic brewing and offers samples of the daily brew. The Creamery offers a selection of lunch options, snacks, sweets and frozen custard. An event space is located in the octagonal Clausing Barn. Trams run between the Scandinavian and Life on the Farms, and Crossroads Village Areas.

==History==
Old World Wisconsin exists largely due to the efforts of German immigrant Hans Kuether and architect Richard W. E. Perrin. Perrin was an early advocate for the preservation of historic structures as evidenced by his involvement with the &quot;Association for the Preservation of Historic Buildings&quot; and with the preservation of the Mitchell-Rountree House in Platteville, Wisconsin in 1959. Perrin published a guide book in 1960 titled &quot;Historic Wisconsin Architecture&quot; listing 76 structures in Wisconsin that he felt were worthy of preservation. Perrin first proposed the idea for an outdoor museum in 1964 in the form of a &quot;Pioneer Park&quot;. Perrin&#x27;s inspiration for the park actually dated back to a trip he made to Europe in 1953 and visited European outdoor museums including Skansen in Sweden which he used as his model for the Wisconsin Park.

The effort to actually create the museum began in 1966, when the University of Wisconsin Department of Landscape Architucture and the Wisconsin Historical Society, agreed to have an undergraduate class at the university prepare preliminary plans for an outdoor museum. The proposals created were published in a report titled &quot;Heritage Village, Wisconsin – A Preliminary Proposal&quot;. Following this, two graduate students were selected to refine and expand the preliminary programs through research, on-site investigations and design studies and create a master plan for development. The study was co-funded by the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences and the State Historical Society at a cost of under $5,000. In 1968, the master plan was summarized in a 122-page report which also included an economic feasibility study by a graduate student in the School of Business. The project was named &quot;Old World Wisconsin&quot; and the &quot;Heritage&quot; wording was later applied to the Heritage Hill State Historical Park near Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Fundraising for purchase of property estimated at $30,000 were begun in January 1969. In June 1971 it was announced that the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources would transfer about 560 acres of property that was then part of the Kettle Moraine State Forest to the State Historical Society for the museum. Development costs were estimated at $1.5 million at that time with about 20% of that coming from private donors.

Development of the park was intended to start in 1972 and the Historical Society had already moved 11 dismantled structures to the site but work was delayed until 1973 pending completion of an environmental impact study. A dispute arose in 1973 with the Town of Eagle. The residents of the town were concerned about the impact the environmental impact statement revealed that the development of the museum would have on their town and the town board became concerned over lack of control by local zoning and building permits. The board had directed the town&#x27;s building inspector to post a stop-work order at the site. The state filed a suit to vacate the order and $50,000 damages. The town countersued for $5,000,000 claiming that newly passed state law required the state to follow local zoning ordinances. The court lifted the order stating that work had started at the site before the law took effect on August 1 and was therefore exempt from the new rule. The town did not give up on their lawsuit until November 1974.

The park was dedicated on June 8, 1974, with a flag-raising ceremony. At the time there were 8 structures completed or under construction.

In May 1975, the society reported that construction was still on schedule but that estimated costs had risen from $2.3 million to $4.5 million but that donations had only produced about $1 million.

In December 1975 Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey announced that a $4 million fund raising campaign would be chaired by Herbert Kohler Jr. and his wife Linda. The Kohler family already had a 45-year history of historic building construction and restoration through the Kohler Foundation dating back to the 1931 construction of the Waelderhaus and the 1950s restoration of the Sylvanus Wade House.

The queen of Denmark, Margrethe II dedicated the Danish exhibit on May 14, 1976.

The museum officially opened on June 30, 1976, in time for the United States Bicentennial celebration.

===Tornado damage===
On the evening of June 21, 2010, the museum was hit by a tornado that leveled acres of trees on the grounds. The &quot;Old World 4th of July&quot; event was canceled because of the clean-up efforts.

<text>Master Mold is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics most commonly appearing as an enemy of the X-Men. 

==Publication history==

Master Mold first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #15–16 (Dec. 1965–Jan. 1966), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

The character subsequently appears in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; Annual #7 (1978); &quot;X-Factor&quot; #13–14 (Feb.–March 1987); &quot;Power Pack&quot; #36 (April 1988); &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #18–24 (May–July 1989); &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #246–247 (July–Aug. 1989); &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; #30 (Aug. 1991); and &quot;Cyclops: Retribution&quot; #1 (Jan. 1994).

Master Mold received an entry in &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update &#x27;89&quot; #5.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original version===
The original version of Master Mold was created by Dr. Bolivar Trask during the original run of &quot;X-Men&quot; comics. Fearing superhuman mutants such as the X-Men, Trask makes a super-computer in the shape of a giant robot that will control and facilitate the construction of the Sentinels (mechanical warriors programmed to hunt and capture superhuman mutants). Secretly, the original version was also programmed by the time-traveling Madame Sanctity of the Askani Sisterhood with the mission to find and destroy The Twelve, a group of mutants that are linked to Apocalypse&#x27;s rise. Master Mold had Trask captured, and decided to take over humanity in order to keep it safe. The original Master Mold prototype was eventually destroyed when Trask sacrifices himself by causing an explosion to prevent the Sentinels taking over humanity (but several other versions are later built by other bigots who want to manufacture Sentinels).

===Second version===
Another version of Master Mold had Steven Lang&#x27;s brainwaves. After Project Armageddon, Lang tries to activate Master Mold which merged the former&#x27;s mind with it instead. The computer suffered great damage by the Hulk who was with Angel and Iceman in Master Mold&#x27;s meteor space base and was seemingly destroyed when the base exploded, after the trio manages to escape. However, Master Mold survived and creates the Retribution Virus to wipe out mutant-kind. It blames Cyclops entirely for its &quot;death&quot; as Lang. He hypnotizes and utilized Moira MacTaggart to unleash the virus, infecting Cyclops, Callisto, and Banshee before MacTaggart breaks free of his grasp. While she attempts to cure the virus, Cyclops and Callisto team with Conscience (another artificial construct developed from Lang&#x27;s brain engrams) to stop Master Mold and save mutant-kind as well as all humanity, which had become threatened by the virus. Cyclops was weakened from the disease&#x27;s effects but nearly single-handedly destroys Master Mold before finally succumbing to the illness and falling unconscious. As Master Mold prepares to kill Cyclops and finish unleashing the virus, he is suddenly attacked by the cured Banshee who uses his sonic scream to &quot;finish the job that Cyclops started&quot; and destroys Master Mold. The virus is then cured before it has a chance to spread.

The remains of Master Mold later merge with the advanced Sentinel Nimrod from the future thanks to the Siege Perilous to form the humanoid cyborg Bastion which acts like an almost-human version of Master Mold.

===Third version===
A Master Mold-esque factory is built in secret in the jungles of Ecuador. This particular version builds the Wild Sentinels which are capable of assimilating non-organic materials to assume different shapes, such as an insectoid, as well as a breed of Nano-Sentinels. The Wild Sentinels are taken over by Cassandra Nova to destroy Genosha and in her subsequent plan to destroy the X-Men. Following their defeat by Rogue&#x27;s X-Men team, the Children of the Vault escaped and regrouped in this Ecuadorian location.

===Other versions===
In &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot;, X-Force travels to the Days of Future Past timeline where there are two Master Molds, one producing Nimrods and another one protecting the first Master Mold.

Mendel Stromm was approached by a mysterious benefactor involving a Master Mold that specializes in the creation of Tri-Sentinels. Spider-Man was able to take remote control of the Tri-Sentinels and send them back to Master Mold to destroy it.

===Mother Mold===
A new version called Mother Mold is seen in &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;. Orchis creates a variant designed to create other Master Molds. It is later revealed that Mother Mold will be the Sentinel generation that lead directly to the creation of Nimrod.

==Capabilities==
Dr. Bolivar Trask equipped Master Mold with powerful weaponry and the ability to speak; Master Mold was also mobile so that it could defend itself from mutant attackers or so that it can be relocated easily if Trask had to find a new headquarters. The Steven Lang Master Molds were also capable of self-repair.

==Other versions==
===Infinity Warps===
Master Mole, a fusion of Master Mold and Mole Man created by the Infinity Gems, appears in &quot;Infinity Wars: Infinity Warps&quot; #1.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Two characters based on Master Mold appear in the Ultimate Marvel universe (Earth-1610): 
* The first equivalent is an alternate timeline variant of Wolverine who was used as a template to create an army of Sentinels before being mercy-killed by the present-day Wolverine and Rogue. 
* The second equivalent is a giant Sentinel which houses William Stryker Jr.&#x27;s consciousness.

===Weapon X: Days of Future Now===
In the alternate reality of &quot;Weapon X: Days of Future Now&quot;, one of Madison Jeffries&#x27;s Boxbots, dubbed &quot;Bot&quot;, becomes the new Master Mold and traps Jeffries within its body to harness his powers.

===What If?===
In &quot;What If? Age of Ultron&quot; series set in an alternative future, Wolverine, the Hulk, Peter Parker and a Ghost Rider travel to the Savage Land to confront Ezekiel Stane using Master Mold to reproduce Iron Man armors. Stane uses an unnamed girl, described as an orphan, the sole remaining Trask descendant, and referred to only as &#x27;Ms. Trask&#x27;, to operate Master Mold that had apparently been left behind in the Savage Land. Seeking to unleash a wave of the armors upon the world, Stane is stopped, and Master Mold ultimately destroyed.

===X-Factor Forever===
In &quot;X-Factor Forever Master Mold&quot;, Master Mold is bonded to Cameron Hodge by Apocalypse to form Master Meld.

<text>Shota Arveladze (; born 22 February 1973) is a Georgian professional football manager and former player who most recently coached Turkish club Fatih Karagümrük.

Arveladze played at Dinamo Tbilisi, Trabzonspor, Ajax, Rangers, AZ and Levante. He is Georgia&#x27;s all-time top scorer with 291 goals in his 410 league games for his clubs and 26 goals in his 61 games for the national team.

His 27 goals scored in the UEFA Cup competition, including qualifiers ranks him third in the tournament&#x27;s history before it became the Europa League. He has the best strike record of independent Georgian Football. He was nominated as the best player of Georgia as well as the best player by the Georgian Professional Football league survey.

==Club career==

===Tbilisi and Trabzonspor===
Arveladze played at Dinamo Tbilisi, Trabzonspor, and Ajax, and finished at least one season as the top goal scorer at all three. In 1993, he scored an effective first Euro Tournament goal in the history of independent Georgian Football in the match against Linfield, Northern Ireland. When he led Trabzonspor in goals in 1995–96, he also led the Süper Lig, making him the second non-Turk to date to lead that league in goals after Tarik Hodžić 1983–84. He is recorded as &quot;most loved foreign player&quot; for Trabzonspor supporters.

===Ajax===
In summer 1997, Arveladze signed for Ajax. Later, he declared that he was so nervous during his first training session, that he even forgot to take football boots with him. He became a close friend to Ronald de Boer during his spell in Amsterdam. His first game at the Amsterdam Arena was a special day for the Georgian player. On 15 August 1997, Ajax faced Brazilian side Grêmio in a friendly game. Arveladze scored a goal, while his wife Tamuna gave birth to their first child, Giorgi hours before the game.

Arveladze made a debut for Ajax against Vitesse, where he replaced Gerald Sibon and scored the fourth goal for the club. During his first season, he scored three hat-tricks in Eredivisie and total 25 goals in 31 appearances. The manager of the Amsterdam-based club Morten Olsen was very pleased with the performance of the young striker. Arveladze was a key figure for the club during 1997–98 UEFA Cup as well. He scored seven goals in eight games for the club, including hat-trick against NK Maribor. Ajax were eliminated in quarter-finals, against Spartak Moscow. Arveladze scored the club&#x27;s single goal in a tie. During his first season, he faced twice NAC Breda, where his twin brother Archil played. This remains as one of the most memorable facts in Shota&#x27;s career.

In summer 1998, Ajax signed Arveladze&#x27;s close friend Giorgi Kinkladze from Manchester City for £5 million. They had been friends since their childhood and that looked like a dream move for both. However, Kinkladze&#x27;s spell at Ajax proved unsuccessful.

===Rangers===
Arveladze joined Rangers from Ajax for £3 million in 2001. He agreed a four-year deal with the club. It was obvious that the Georgian would face a fierce competitions for the starting place in the Rangers&#x27; strike force from the players like Tore Andre Flo, Claudio Caniggia, Michael Mols, Kenny Miller, Billy Dodds, Ronald de Boer and Russell Latapy.

During the first season with Glasgow-based club, Arveladze scored 17 goals overall, including 11 in Scottish Premier League. He only managed to take part in 30 games, after being injured in February in the quarterfinal of the Scottish Cup against Forfar Athletic, an injury which meant he missed the 2002 Scottish League Cup Final. However, he scored six goals for his club, which managed to win the title. Arveladze played in the final, replacing Claudio Caniggia. This was his first title with the Scottish club.

The following season was the most successful in the career of the Georgian player. Rangers won treble. In March 2003, Rangers defeated their arch-rivals Celtic in the League Cup Final. Later in the Scottish Cup Final, Rangers won another title, after they managed to defeat Dundee with a goal from Lorenzo Amoruso. Arveladze&#x27;s two compatriots Georgi Nemsadze and Zurab Khizanishvili also took part in this game. The latter joined Arveladze at Rangers during that summer.

In May 2005, Arveladze declared that he would leave the club after the end of the season, in which he managed to score 9 goals. He confirmed receiving offers from various clubs in Europe, including teams from England, Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey.

During his time at Rangers, Arveladze had a nickname, &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, because of his facial likeness to Rowan Atkinson.

During a legal case in 2015, Arveladze&#x27;s agent claimed that the true transfer fee had been 12 million Euro, the equivalent of £8.5 million at the time. Arveladze scored the 300th goal in the SPL and was part of Rangers squads that won the domestic treble in 2002–03 and a double in 2004–05.

===AZ===
Arveladze departed Rangers for Dutch side AZ on a free transfer before the start of 2005–06 season, signing a two-year deal with the club.

Under the guidance of Louis van Gaal, Arveladze became the key figure of the club. He scored 22 goals in Eredivisie, becoming the second best top-scorer of the tournament after Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who scored 33 goals during the season. Alkmaar participated in UEFA Cup this time as well. In 6 game for the club, Arveladze made 2 assists and scored 2 goals, one of them against Real Betis. At the end of the season, AZ Alkmaar and Arveladze agreed a contract extension to keep the Georgian international striker at the Dutch club until the summer of 2008.

During the second and the final season with the club, Arveladze was appointed as the new captain of the club. He was offered the armband after Denny Landzaat and Joris Mathijsen left for Wigan Athletic and Hamburger SV respectively. The Georgian was praised by Louis van Gaal, under whose guidance he played at Ajax as well. Van Gaal compared Arveladze to Danny Blind and Frank Rijkaard in terms of personality, calling him &quot;the top professional in the squad&quot;.

He scored 23 goals, accumulating total 48 goals for AZ in 89 competitive appearances. The Georgian striker scored seven goals in UEFA Cup as well, two of them at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium in a 2–1 away win against Sevilla.

===Levante===
In July 2007, Arveladze passed a medical and agreed a one-year contract with the Spanish club Levante. He was injured in summer training and missed nearly ten months, undergoing surgery in Amsterdam. He returned and made his debut against Villarreal on 23 March, replacing Juanma. He managed to take part in other 3 games until the end of the season.

In April, Levante confirmed that Arveladze would retire at the end of the season. In the last game of his career he played at the Santiago Bernabeu against Real Madrid, losing 5–2.

==International career==
Shota Arveladze was a regular in the Georgian national team and is its all-time leading scorer with 26 goals in his 61 games. 16 of these 26 goals came in European Championship qualifiers.

He made his international debut in Georgia&#x27;s first official game on 2 September 1992, a 1–0 friendly loss away to Lithuania. Fifteen days later, he scored his first goal in the country&#x27;s first home game, a 6–3 win over neighbours Azerbaijan. His first competitive goal was on 16 November, in a 5–0 win over Wales in Tbilisi for UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying.

On 30 March 1997, Arveladze scored a hat-trick in a 7–0 home friendly win against neighbours Armenia. With Georgia he won in 1998 the Malta International Football Tournament. On 18 August 2006, he scored a hat-trick away to the Faroe Islands in a 6–0 win in the opening game of UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying. His final game was the following 24 March in another qualifier, equalising in a 2–1 loss away to Scotland.

==Coaching career==
After retiring as a player, Arveladze was appointed as assistant manager of AZ under head coach and former Ajax coach Louis van Gaal in July 2008. He maintained this position in the 2009–10 season under Ronald Koeman and Dick Advocaat.
For the 2010–11 season, Arveladze served as manager of Turkish side Kayserispor. From 2012 to 2015, he managed Istanbul-based Kasımpaşa. In his final game, the team scored away to Konyaspor while their players were attending to his injured player, Ryan Babel. Arveladze then allowed Konyaspor to score an equaliser in the name of fair play, and Konyaspor won the game 2–1. He resigned after the game.

On 3 July 2015, Arveladze was named as manager of Turkish side Trabzonspor. He resigned in November. Under him and his successor Hami Mandıralı, the side lost a record 17 games that season.

In June 2016, Arveladze was announced as the new head coach of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv Around the middle of the season, he was fired; it was the first time that Maccabi had dismissed a coach during a season since 2011.

In 2017, Arveladze was announced as head coach of Pakhtakor Tashkent in Uzbekistan. He won the Uzbekistan Super League and Cup in 2019 and 2020. On 21 December 2020, he left.

Arveladze was dismissed by Hull City on 30 September 2022, with the team 20th in the EFL Championship after four consecutive defeats.

On 11 December 2023, Arveladze was announced that he was agreed in principle for Head Coach of Fatih Karagümrük.

<doc id="838491" wikidata="Q5980111" url="?curid=838491" title="I before E except after C">
<text>&quot;I before E, except after C&quot; is a mnemonic rule of thumb for English spelling. If one is unsure whether a word is spelled with the digraph or , the rhyme suggests that the correct order is unless the preceding letter is , in which case it may be . 

The rhyme is very well known; Edward Carney calls it &quot;this supreme, and for many people solitary, spelling rule&quot;. However, the short form quoted above has many common exceptions; for example: 
* after : &quot;species&quot;, &quot;science&quot;, &quot;sufficient&quot;, &quot;society&quot;
* not preceded by : &quot;seize&quot;, &quot;vein&quot;, &quot;weird&quot;, &quot;heist&quot;, &quot;their&quot;, &quot;feisty&quot;, &quot;foreign&quot;, &quot;protein&quot;

The proportion of exceptions can be reduced by restricting application of the rule based on the sound represented by the spelling. Two common restrictions are:

* excluding cases where the spelling represents the &quot;long a&quot; sound (the lexical sets of FACE and perhaps SQUARE ). This is commonly expressed by continuing the rhyme &quot;or when sounding like A, as in neighbor or weigh&quot;.
* including only cases where the spelling represents the &quot;long e&quot; sound (the lexical sets of FLEECE and perhaps NEAR and happY ).

Variant pronunciations of some words (such as &quot;heinous&quot; and &quot;neither&quot;) complicate application of sound-based restrictions, which do not eliminate all exceptions. Many authorities deprecate the rule as having too many exceptions to be worth learning.

== History of the spellings ==
The Middle English language evolved from Old English after the Norman conquest, adding many loanwords from Norman French, whose sounds and spellings changed and were changed by the older English customs. In French loanwords, the digraph generally represented the sound , while represented ; was later extended to signify in non-French words. In the Great Vowel Shift, sounds and were raised to and respectively. Later, the &quot;meet&quot;–&quot;meat&quot; merger saw the vowel in many words change to , so that &quot;meat&quot; became a homonym of &quot;meet&quot;, while &quot;conceive&quot; now rhymed with &quot;believe&quot;.

Early Modern English spelling was not fixed; many words were spelled with and interchangeably, in printed works of the 17th century and private correspondence of educated people into the 19th century.

== History of the mnemonic ==
The mnemonic (in its short form) is found as early as 1866, as a footnote in &quot;Manual of English Spelling&quot;, edited by schools inspector James Stuart Laurie from the work of a Tavistock schoolmaster named Marshall. Michael Quinion surmises the rhyme was already established before this date. An 1834 manual states a similar rule in prose; others in 1855 and 1862 use different rhymes. Many textbooks from the 1870s on use the same rhyme as Laurie&#x27;s book.

The restriction to the &quot;long e&quot; sound is explicitly made in the 1855 and 1862 books, and applied to the &quot;I before E except after C&quot; rhyme in an 1871 manual. Mark Wainwright&#x27;s FAQ posting on the alt.usage.English newsgroup characterises this restricted version as British. The restriction may be implicit, or may be explicitly included as an extra line such as &quot;when the sound is e&quot; placed before or after the main part of the rhyme.

A longer form excluding the &quot;long a&quot; sound is found in Rule 37 of Ebenezer Cobham Brewer&#x27;s 1880 &quot;Rules for English Spelling&quot;, along with a list of the &quot;chief exceptions&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;The following rhymes contain the substance of the last three rules:—

:i before e,
:Except after c,
:Or when sounded as &quot;a&quot;,
:As in &quot;neighbor&quot; and &quot;weigh&quot;
:But &quot;seizure&quot; and &quot;seize&quot; do what they please.&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;Dr Brewer&quot; is credited as the author by subsequent writers quoting this form of the rhyme, which became common in American schools.

&quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; discusses &quot;i before e except after c&quot;. Henry Watson Fowler&#x27;s original 1926 edition called the rule &quot;very useful&quot;, restricting it to words with the &quot;long e&quot; sound, stating further that &quot;words in which that sound is not invariable, as &quot;either&quot;, &quot;neither&quot;, &quot;inveigle&quot;, do not come under it&quot;, and calling &quot;seize&quot; &quot;an important exception&quot;. The entry was retained in Ernest Gowers&#x27;s 1965 revision. Robert Burchfield rewrote it for the 1996 edition, stating &#x27;the rule can helpfully be extended &quot;except when the word is pronounced with &quot;&#x27;, and giving a longer list of exceptions, including words excluded from Fowler&#x27;s interpretation. Robert Allen&#x27;s 2008 pocket edition states, &quot;The traditional spelling rule &#x27; &quot;i&quot; before &quot;e&quot; except after &quot;c&quot; &#x27; should be extended to include the statement &#x27;when the combination is pronounced -ee- &#x27;&quot;. Jeremy Butterfield&#x27;s 2015 edition suggests both &quot;when ... pronounced &quot;-ee-&quot;&quot; and &quot;except when ... pronounced &quot;-ay-&quot;&quot; as extensions to the rhyme, as well as listing various classes of exception.

In 1932 Leonard B. Wheat examined the rules and word lists found in various American elementary school spelling books. He calculated that, of the 3,876 words listed, 128 had &quot;ei&quot; or &quot;ie&quot; in the spelling; of these, 83 conformed to I-before-E, 6 to except-after-C, and 12 to sounded-like-A. He found 14 words with &quot;i-e&quot; in separate syllables, and 2 with &quot;e-i&quot; in separate syllables. This left 11 &quot;irregular&quot; words: 3 with &quot;cie&quot; (&quot;ancient, conscience, efficiency&quot;) and 8 with &quot;ei&quot; (&quot;either, foreign, foreigner, height, leisure, neither, seize, their&quot;). Wheat concluded, &quot;If it were not for the fact that the jingle of the rule makes it easy to remember (although not necessarily easy to apply), the writer would recommend that the rule be reduced to &#x27;&quot;I&quot; usually comes before &quot;e&quot;,&#x27; or that it be discarded entirely&quot;.

==Modern views==
Sandra Wilde in 1990 claimed the sounded-like-E version of the rule was one of only two sound–letter correspondence rules worth teaching in elementary schools. The rule was covered by five of nine software programs for spelling education studied by Barbara Mullock in 2012.

Edward Carney&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Survey of English Spelling&quot; describes the [&quot;long-e&quot; version of the] rule as &quot;peculiar&quot;:

As to the usefulness of the rule, he says:

The converse of the &quot;except after c&quot; part is Carney&#x27;s spelling-to-sound rule E.16: in the sequence ⟨cei⟩, the ⟨ei⟩ is pronounced . In Carney&#x27;s test wordlist, all eight words with ⟨cei⟩ conform to this rule, which he thus describes as being a &quot;marginal&quot; rule with an &quot;efficiency&quot; of 100%. Rarer words not in the wordlist may not conform; for example, in &quot;haecceity&quot;, &quot;ceilidh&quot;, and &quot;enceinte&quot; the &quot;ei&quot; represents , , and respectively.

Mark Wainwright&#x27;s FAQ posting interprets the rule as applying only to the FLEECE vowel, not the NEAR vowel; he regards it as useful if &quot;a little common sense&quot; is used for the exceptions. The FAQ includes a 1996 response to Wainwright by an American, listing variations on the rule and their exceptions, contending that even the restricted version has too many exceptions, and concluding &quot;Instead of trying to defend the &#x27;rule&#x27; or &#x27;guideline&#x27;, &quot;&#x27;i&#x27; before &#x27;e&#x27; except after &#x27;c&#x27;&quot;, why don&#x27;t we all just agree that it is dumb and useless, and be content just to laugh at it?&quot;

Kory Stamper of Merriam-Webster has said the neighbor-and-weigh version is &quot;chocked with tons of exceptions&quot;, listing several types. On Language Log in 2006, Mark Liberman suggested that the alternative &quot;i before e, no matter what&quot; was more reliable than the basic rule. On the same blog in 2009, Geoff Pullum wrote, &#x27;The rule is always taught, by anyone who knows what they are doing, as &quot;i before e except after c when the sound is &#x27;ee&#x27;.&quot;&#x27;

&quot;Teaching English Spelling&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2000) provides a system of sound–spelling correspondences aimed at correcting common spelling errors among native and ESL students. The chapter &quot;The sound &#x27;e&#x27; (/iː/)&quot; has sections on spellings &quot;ee&quot;, &quot;ea&quot;, &quot;-y&quot; and &quot;ie and ei&quot;, the last of which uses &quot;I before E except after C&quot; and lists five &quot;common exceptions&quot; &quot;(caffeine, codeine, protein, seize, weird)&quot;.

The 2009 edition of &quot;Support for Spelling&quot;, by the English Department for Education, suggests an &quot;Extension activity&quot; for Year five (10-year-olds):
*Children investigate the rule i before e except after c. Does this always apply? What sound does ie make in these words?
In the Appendix, after a list of nine &quot;useful spelling guidelines&quot;, there is a note:
*The i before e except after c rule is not worth teaching. It applies only to words in which the ie or ei stands for a clear /ee/ sound and unless this is known, words such as &quot;sufficient&quot;, &quot;veil&quot; and &quot;their&quot; look like exceptions. There are so few words where the ei spelling for the /ee/ sound follows the letter c that it is easier to learn the specific words: &quot;receive&quot;, &quot;conceive&quot;, &quot;deceive&quot; (+ the related words &quot;receipt&quot;, &quot;conceit&quot;, &quot;deceit&quot;), &quot;perceive&quot; and &quot;ceiling&quot;.
There were widespread media reports of this recommendation, which generated some controversy.

The &quot;Oxford Dictionaries&quot; website of Oxford University Press states &quot;The rule only applies when the sound represented is &#x27;ee&#x27;, though. It doesn&#x27;t apply to words like &quot;science&quot; or &quot;efficient&quot;, in which the &quot;–ie-&quot; combination does follow the letter &quot;c&quot; but isn&#x27;t pronounced &#x27;ee&#x27;.&quot;

David Crystal discusses the rule in his 2012 history of English spelling. He first restricts it to the vowel, then accounts for several classes of exception. He states that, while the exceptions are fewer and rarer than the words that follow the rule, there are too many to learn by heart; the factors are &quot;too great to reduce to a simple rule&quot;, but &quot;a basic knowledge of grammar and word-history&quot; can handle them.

Educationalist Greg Brooks says the long-e qualification &quot;is hardly ever mentioned, perhaps because it is difficult to explain to children&quot;; the except-after-C part &quot;works very poorly&quot;; and the mnemonic &quot;should be consigned to oblivion&quot;.

==Exceptions==
The following sections list exceptions to the basic form; many are not exceptions to the augmented forms.

Words that break both the &quot;I before E&quot; part and the &quot;except after C&quot; part of the rule include , , , and , as well as Pleistocene from the geologic time scale.

===cie===
Some large groups of words have &quot;cie&quot; in the spelling. Few common words have the &quot;cei&quot; spelling handled by the rule: verbs ending &quot;-ceive&quot; and their derivatives (&quot;perceive&quot;, &quot;deceit&quot;, &quot;transceiver&quot;, &quot;receipts&quot;, etc.), and &quot;ceiling&quot;. The BBC trivia show &quot;QI&quot; claimed there were 923 words spelled &quot;cie&quot;, 21 times the number of words that conform to the rule&#x27;s stated exception by being written with &quot;cei&quot;. These figures were generated by a QI fan from a Scrabble wordlist. The statistic was repeated by UberFacts.

====With the &quot;long e&quot; vowel====
The vowel represented by &quot;ie&quot; in words spelled &quot;cie&quot; is rarely the &quot;long e&quot; vowel of FLEECE (), so few words are exceptions to the version of the rule restricted to that sound. Among them are &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;. 

For those with &quot;happy&quot;-tensing accents, the final &quot;y&quot; in words ending &quot;-cy&quot; has the FLEECE vowel, and therefore so do inflected forms ending &quot;-cies&quot; or &quot;-cied&quot; (&quot;fancied&quot;, &quot;policies&quot;, etc.).

If the vowel of NEAR () is considered as &quot;long e&quot;, then words ending &quot;-cier&quot; may also be exceptions. Possible examples include: &quot;fancier&quot;, if pronounced with two rather than three syllables; or &quot;financier&quot;, if stressed on the final syllable or pronounced with a &quot;happy&quot;-tensing accent.

====With other sounds====
These are exceptions to the basic and &quot;long a&quot; versions of the rhyme, but not to the &quot;long e&quot; version.

Types include:
* Adding suffix &quot;-er&quot; to root in &quot;-cy&quot;, giving a two-syllable ending &quot;-cier&quot;; For example, &quot;fancier&quot; (adjective &quot;more fancy&quot;, or noun &quot;one who fancies&quot;)
* Words of Latin origin with a root ending in &quot;c(i)&quot; followed by a suffix or inflexion starting in &quot;(i)e&quot;; such as 
** &quot;do; make&quot; (&quot;efficient, stupefacient&quot;, etc.) 
** &quot;&quot; &quot;sharing; kin&quot; (&quot;society&quot;)
** &quot;&quot; &quot;know&quot; (&quot;science, prescient&quot;, etc.)
*Others: &quot;ancient&quot;, &quot;concierge&quot;, &quot;glacier&quot;

===ei not preceded by c===
Many words have &quot;ei&quot; not preceded by &quot;c&quot;. In the sections that follow, most derived forms are omitted; for example, as well as &quot;seize&quot;, there exist &quot;disseize&quot; and &quot;seizure&quot;. Words are grouped by the phonemes (sounds) corresponding to &quot;ei&quot; or &quot;ie&quot; in the spelling; each phoneme is represented phonetically as at and, where applicable, by the keyword in John C. Wells&#x27; lexical sets.

An asterisk* after a word indicates the pronunciation implied is one of several found. Some have an variant more common in America than Britain (e.g. &quot;sheikh&quot;, &quot;leisure&quot;, &quot;either&quot; have , , respectively).

====With the &quot;long e&quot; vowel====
Words where &quot;ei&quot;, not preceded by &quot;c&quot;, represents the vowel of FLEECE (), are the only exceptions to the strictest British interpretation of the &quot;long e&quot; version of the rhyme. Less strict interpretations admit as exceptions those words where &quot;eir&quot;, not preceded by &quot;c&quot;, represents the vowel of NEAR ().

Some categories of exception:
* Many proper names, often because they are adopted from other languages. Fowler says the rule &quot;is useless with proper names&quot;; Carney says &quot;As one might expect of any rule, there are likely to be even more exceptions in names, many of which are Scottish&quot;:
** forenames and surnames &quot;Keith, Neil, Sheila, Stein&quot;, etc.
** placenames &quot;Leith, Keighley&quot;, &quot;Rheims&quot;, &quot;Raleigh&quot;, etc.
** &quot;Eid&quot; in the names of Muslim holidays (Eid ul-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, etc.)
** others like &quot;Cassiopeia&quot;
*Chemical names ending in &quot;-ein&quot; or &quot;-eine&quot; (&quot;caffeine, casein, codeine, phthalein, protein,&quot; etc.). Here &quot;-ein(e)&quot; was originally pronounced as two syllables 
*Scottish English words (&quot;deil, deid, weill,&quot; etc.) Mark Wainwright writes &quot;There are many exceptions in Scots, so speakers with a large Scots vocabulary may as well give up on this rule.&quot;

Other exceptions:
; FLEECE: &quot;either*, heinous*, inveigle*, keister, leisure*, monteith, neither*, obeisance*, seize, seizin, sheikh*, teiid&quot; 
; NEAR: &quot;madeira, weir, weird&quot;. (This sound may also be spelled &quot;ier&quot;, as in &quot;pierce&quot;.)

====With the &quot;long a&quot; vowel====
There are many words where &quot;ei&quot;, not preceded by &quot;c&quot;, represents the vowel of FACE (). There are a few where &quot;eir&quot;, not preceded by &quot;c&quot;, represents the vowel of SQUARE (). These groups of words are exceptions only to the basic form of the rhyme; they are excluded from both of the common restricted forms.

; FACE: 
* With &quot;eigh&quot; spelling: &quot;eight, freight, heigh-ho*, inveigh, neigh, neighbo(u)r, sleigh, weigh&quot;
* Others: &quot;abseil, beige, capoeira, cleidoic, deign, dreidel, feign, feint, geisha, glei, greige, greisen, heinous*, inveigle*, nonpareil*, obeisance*, peignoir*, reign, rein, seiche, seidel, seine, sheikh*, skein, surveillance, veil, vein&quot;. (While Carney says this sound is never spelled &quot;ie&quot;, the last vowel in &quot;lingerie&quot;* is often the FACE vowel.).
; SQUARE: &quot;heir, their&quot;. (This sound is never spelled &quot;ier&quot;)

==== With other sounds ====
These are exceptions to the basic and &quot;long a&quot; versions of the rhyme, but not to the &quot;long e&quot; version.

; PRICE: 
* German origin: &quot;einsteinium, gneiss, leitmotiv, Rottweiler, stein, zeitgeist&quot;. 
* Others: &quot;eider, either*, feisty, heigh-ho*, height, heist, kaleidoscope, neither*, seismic, sleight&quot; 
:(This sound may also be spelled &quot;ie&quot;, but only at the end of a morpheme as in &quot;die, pies, cried&quot;.)
; or (see weak-vowel merger): &quot;counterfeit, cuneiform*, foreign, forfeit, reveille*, sovereign, surfeit&quot;
; DRESS: &quot;heifer, leisure*, nonpareil*, peignoir*&quot;. (This sound is spelled &quot;ie&quot; in the word &quot;friend&quot;.)
; TRAP: &quot;reveille*&quot;
; NURSE: &quot;O&#x27;Beirne&quot;
;&quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; in separate segments (and often separate syllables or morphemes): 
*Prefixes &quot;de-&quot; or &quot;re-&quot; before words starting with &quot;i&quot; (&quot;deindustrialize, reignite,&quot; etc.)
*Inflection &quot;-ing&quot; of those verbs with roots ending in &quot;-e&quot; that do not drop the &quot;e&quot; (&quot;being, seeing, swingeing,&quot; etc.)
*Others: &quot;albeit, atheism, cuneiform*, deify*, deity*, herein, nuclei, onomatopoeia&quot;

==Popular culture==
The rhyme is mentioned in several films and TV episodes about spelling bees, including &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;I&#x27;m Spelling as Fast as I Can&quot;, The Pen Is Mightier Than the Pencil episode of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, and an episode of &quot;Arthur&quot;; and also in the musical &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;, when Huckleberry Finn is being taught how to read. The rhyme was used as a climactic plot device in the 1990 &quot;TaleSpin&quot; episode &quot;Vowel Play&quot; when Kit corrects Baloo&#x27;s spelling by reciting the second half (&quot;or when sounding like A, as in neighbour or weigh&quot;) of the mnemonic.

&quot;I Before E (Except After C): Old-School Ways To Remember Stuff&quot; was a miscellany released in the UK for the Christmas 2007 &quot;stocking filler&quot; market, which sold well.

&quot;I Before E Except After C&quot; is a song on Yazoo&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot;. The Jackson 5&#x27;s 1970 hit &quot;ABC&quot; has the lyric &quot;I before E except after C&quot;. &quot;I before E except after C&quot; was a 1963 episode of the TV series &quot;East Side/West Side&quot;.

&quot;I Before E&quot; is the name of both a short-story collection by Sam Kieth and a music album by Carissa&#x27;s Wierd, in each case alluding to the unusual spelling of the creator&#x27;s name.
Until the 1930s, Pierce City, Missouri was named &quot;Peirce City&quot;, after Andrew Peirce. A 1982 attempt to revert to the original spelling was rejected by the United States Census Bureau.

Comedian Brian Regan employs the rule in a joke on his debut CD &quot;Live&quot; in the track &quot;Stupid in School,&quot; where he states it as &quot;I before E, except after C, and with sounding like A, as in neighbor and weigh, and on weekends and holidays and all throughout May, and you&#x27;ll always be wrong no matter what you say!&quot;

<text>Solon Irving Bailey (December 29, 1854 – June 5, 1931) was an American astronomer and discoverer of the asteriod 504 Cora, on June 30, 1902.

Bailey joined the staff of Harvard College Observatory in 1887. He received a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s from Boston University in 1881 and 1884, and a master&#x27;s from Harvard University in 1888. After the observatory received the &quot;Boyden Fund&quot; bequest from the will of Uriah A. Boyden, Bailey played a major role in finding a site for Boyden Station in Arequipa, Peru, and was in charge of it from 1892 to 1919. He was also one of the first to carry out meteorological studies in Peru, traveling extensively in desolate areas at very high altitude. Boyden Station was moved to South Africa in 1927 due to better weather conditions and became known as the Boyden Observatory.

He made extensive studies of variable stars in globular clusters in the southern skies. He also performed a light-curve analysis measuring the rotation period of the near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros during its 1903 opposition. Bailey was acting director of Harvard College Observatory from 1919 to 1921 after the death of Edward Charles Pickering and prior to the appointment of Harlow Shapley. He worked as a senior colleague with Henrietta Leavitt. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1892. Irving died on June 5, 1931, aged 76, in Hanover, New Hampshire, from an illness caused by heart disease.

<text>Sulpicius Alexander (fl. late fourth century) was a Roman historian of Germanic tribes. His work is lost, but his &quot;Historia&quot; in at least four books is quoted by Gregory of Tours. It was perhaps a continuation of the &quot;Res gestae&quot; by Ammianus Marcellinus (which ended in 378 AD) and dealt with events at least until the death of Valentinian II (392 AD). The work of Sulpicius Alexander as extracts in Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Decem Libri Historiarum&quot; (II 9) is considered an important source in any discussion of the origin of the Frankish tribes.

<doc id="838510" wikidata="Q219403" url="?curid=838510" title="Constant Troyon">
<text>Constant Troyon (; August 28, 1810 – February 21, 1865) was a French painter of the Barbizon school. In the early part of his career he painted mostly landscapes. It was only comparatively late in life that Troyon found his &quot;métier&quot; as a painter of animals, and achieved international recognition.

==Early years==
He was born in Sèvres, near Paris, where his father was connected with the famous manufactory of porcelain. Troyon entered the ateliers very young as a decorator, and until he was twenty he labored assiduously at the minute details of porcelain ornamentation; and this kind of work he mastered so thoroughly that it was many years before he overcame its limitations. By the time he reached twenty-one he was travelling the country as an artist, and painting landscapes so long as his finances lasted. Then when pressed for money he made friends with the first china manufacturer he met and worked steadily at his old business of decorator until he had accumulated enough funds to permit him to start again on his wanderings.

==Later development==

Troyon was a favorite with Camille Roqueplan, an artist of distinction eight years his senior, and he became one of his pupils after receiving certain tuition from a painter, now quite unknown, named Alfred Riocreux. Roqueplan introduced Troyon to Rousseau, Jules Dupré, and the other Barbizon painters, and in his pictures between 1840 and 1847 he seemed to endeavour to follow in their footsteps.
But as a landscapist Troyon would never have been recognized as a thorough master, although his work of the period is marked with much sincerity and met with a certain success. It may be pointed out, however, that in one or two pure landscapes of the end of his life he achieved qualities of the highest artistic kind; but this was after lengthy experience as a cattle painter, by which his talents had become thoroughly developed.

In 1846 Troyon went to the Netherlands, and at the Hague saw Paulus Potter&#x27;s famous &quot;Young Bull&quot;. From the studies he made of this picture, of Cuyp&#x27;s sunny landscapes, and Rembrandt&#x27;s noble masterpieces he soon evolved a new method of painting, and it is only in works produced after this time that Troyon&#x27;s true individuality is revealed. When he became conscious of his power as an animal painter he developed with rapidity and success, until his works became recognized as masterpieces in Britain and America, as well as in all countries of the European Continent.

The art critic Albert Wolff wrote about this period of Troyon, after the exhibition &quot;Cent Chefs-d&#x27;Oeuvres&quot; in Paris, 1886: &quot;It was accident and a journey to Holland which revealed to Troyon his true mission, that of an animal painter of the first rank ... At a distance of two centuries Troyon continued the traditions of the celebrated Dutch animal painters without imitating them. Paul Potter was to find a successor worthy of him ... Fancy the astonishment at the sight of Troyon&#x27;s animals, with their large life, their broad brush-work in deep, pure colors, studied with a discriminating sympathy for every race and species, and moving through landscapes of a master&#x27;s creation. These were not the fashionable stuffed beasts, but living, moving herds, stretching themselves luxuriously in the sun, breathing the breezes cool with morning, or huddling close together at the approach of the storm.&quot;

Success, however, came too late, for Troyon never quite believed in it himself, and even when he could command the market of several countries he still grumbled loudly at the way the world treated him. Yet he was decorated with the Legion of Honour, and five times received medals at the Paris Salon, while Napoleon III was one of his patrons; and it is certain he was at least as financially successful as his Barbizon colleagues.

Troyon died, unmarried, at Paris on 21 February 1865, after a term of clouded intellect. He was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.

==Recognition==
All his famous pictures are of date between 1850 and 1864, his earlier work being of comparatively little value. His mother, who survived him, instituted the Troyon prize for animal pictures at the École des Beaux Arts. Troyon&#x27;s work is fairly well known to the public through a number of large engravings from his pictures. In the Wallace Gallery in London are &quot;Watering Cattle&quot; and &quot;Cattle in Stormy Weather&quot;; in the Glasgow Corporation Gallery is a &quot;Landscape with Cattle&quot;; the Louvre contains his famous &quot;Oxen at Work&quot; and &quot;Returning to the Farm&quot;; while the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other galleries in America contain fine examples of his pictures. His &quot;Vallée de la Toucque, Normandy&quot;, is one of his greatest pictures; and at Christie&#x27;s sale-room in 1902 the single figure of a cow in a landscape of but moderate quality fetched £7350. Émile van Marcke (1827–1891) was his best-known pupil.

<text>Lars Erik Einar Gustafsson (17 May 1936 – 3 April 2016) was a Swedish poet, novelist, and scholar. Among his awards were the in 2006, the Goethe Medal in 2009, the Thomas Mann Prize in 2015, and the International Nonino Prize in Italy in 2016.

==Life and career==
Gustafsson was born in Västerås, completed his secondary education at the Västerås Gymnasium and continued to Uppsala University, where he studied literature, aesthetics, sociology and philosophy. In 1960, he received a licentiate degree in philosophy. In 1978, he was awarded a PhD in theoretical philosophy with a dissertation on speech and literature. He later served for four years on the university&#x27;s board of regents (1994–1998).

Already by 1960, Gustafsson was publishing novels and poetry regularly. In addition to his literary work, he was editor-in-chief of the renowned literary journal &quot;Bonniers Litterära Magasin&quot; from 1962 to 1972. He soon established international contacts, notably with the German authors in Group 47. In 1972, through a DAAD fellowship he came to West Berlin, where he lived for two years. During this period, he also traveled extensively, among other places to Australia, Singapore, Japan, Israel, and the United States. Throughout his career, he attended and participated in many international academic and cultural events. John Updike described Gustafsson as &quot;the enviably ideal conferee, a red‑bearded fish never out of water, loving books, ideas, and discourse equally, and everywhere adept.&quot;

Having been invited to visit the University of Texas at Austin by its Germanic Studies department in 1972 and again in 1974, and because Austin was his wife&#x27;s hometown he moved there in 1983, where he served at first as adjunct professor in Germanic Studies, later as professor, then Distinguished Professor, in the Plan II Honors program, teaching philosophy and creative writing. He returned to Sweden in 2003 while continuing to hold a research professorship at the university; in 2006, he retired. He lived in Stockholm, spending summers in Västmanland. He died at the age of 79 on 3 April 2016.

Gustafsson was married three times: in 1961 to Madeleine Gustafsson (two children); in 1982 to Alexandra Chasnoff (two children); in 2005 to Agneta Blomqvist. In 1981 Gustafsson converted to Judaism.

In May 2009, Lars Gustafsson declared that he would vote for the Pirate Party in the upcoming elections for the European Parliament. However, in August 2010 he left the Pirate Party in protest of its cooperation with the WikiLeaks portal, which he accused of delivering death lists for the Taliban.

==Writing==
Gustafsson published poetry, novels, short stories, critical essays, and editorials. He gained international recognition as a Swedish writer. By 1990, he had already received a dozen major literary awards including the &quot;&quot; in 1983, &quot;Una Vita per la Letteratura&quot; in 1989, as well as the Swedish Bellman Prize in 1990. He won a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for poetry in 1994. Among later awards were the in 2006, the Goethe Medal in 2009, and the Thomas Mann Prize in 2015. He won the 2016 International Nonino Prize in Italy.

Gustafsson&#x27;s novels and poetry have been translated into fifteen languages, the most often translated being the novels &quot;The Death of a Beekeeper&quot; (En biodlares död), &quot;Bernard Foy&#x27;s Third Castling&quot; (Bernard Foys tredje rockad), and &quot;Afternoon of a Tiler&quot; (En kakelsättares eftermiddag). Harold Bloom includes Gustafsson in &quot;The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages&quot; (1994, p. 557).

&quot;The Death of a Beekeeper,&quot; published in 1978, is Gustafsson&#x27;s best-known novel. John Updike praised it as &quot;a beautiful work, lyrical and bleak, resonant and terse.&quot; Ia Dübois has called it &quot;one of his greatest works.&quot; Eva Stenskar has written that it &quot;seems so effortless yet lyrical that only an artist at the height of his powers could&#x27;ve produced it.&quot; Its main theme is the agony of disease, as it follows Vesslan—a beekeeper who is dying of cancer—through entries he makes on notepads. The book&#x27;s innovative structure allows Gustafsson to explore identity through its expression in a variety of forms: imagination, memory and even the mundane details of life. The book&#x27;s central theme is revealed by the repeated motto of the protagonist, &quot;We never give up. We begin anew.&quot; Gustafsson himself has described it as &quot;A book about pain. It describes a journey into the centre where pain rules—and pain can tolerate no rivals.&quot; The novel was re-published in 1984 as the last in a five-novel sequence &quot;Sprickorna i muren&quot; (The Cracks in the Wall), the other volumes being &quot;Herr Gustafsson själv&quot;, &quot;Yllet&quot;, &quot;Familjefesten&quot;, and &quot;Sigismund&quot;.

&quot;Bernard Foy&#x27;s Third Castling&quot; (1986) is nearly as well known as &quot;The Death of a Beekeeper&quot;. Its settings are Sweden; Paris; Worpswede, Germany; and Texas. The overt genre is the detective story, but there are three plots, and Bernard Foy is three separate characters: a Houston rabbi, an old Swedish poet, and a Swedish teenager. Each gradually turns into a character in the writing of the succeeding Foy. Gustafsson said that he was prompted by a “connection to Descartes&#x27; dream argument: You start with a story and it proves to be the story of a completely different person who is dreaming up the story which proves to be the story of a third person and it is all written by one or another person.”

In 1989, Gustafsson ventured into the field of science fiction and published &quot;Det sällsamma djuret från norr och andra science-fiction-berättelser&quot;. The book takes place 40,000 years into the future, when humans are extinct and the galaxy is populated by artificial intelligences. It is a philosophical exploration of life and existence and can be seen as an homage to Stanislav Lem.

Gustafsson&#x27;s two major fields of interest interacted from the start of his career. In 2003, he wrote that &quot;sometimes I cannot see any sharp boundary between [my literary work] and [my philosophical work]. I tend to regard myself as a philosopher who has turned literature into one of his tools.&quot; When asked where he finds his inspiration, Gustafsson answered &quot;I listen. I listen and I look. Creativity knows no rules. You can get an idea for a novel from a little something someone says, or just a face you see. A rabbi once told me that when God spoke to Moses in that bush, it wasn&#x27;t in a thundering voice but in a very weak voice. You have to listen carefully for that voice. You have to be very sharp.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Yllet&quot;, the second novel in &quot;The Cracks in the Wall&quot; (Sprickorna i Muren) series was made into a feature film, directed by Jimmy Karlsson and starring Magnus Krepper.

While the problem of identity has been the defining theme of Gustafsson&#x27;s writings, his social criticism often vexed the Swedish cultural elite. As a result, he is seen as a controversial writer in Sweden rather than as one embraced by the establishment.

In 2016, he received the Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award.

<text>Suited connectors is a poker term referring to pocket cards that are suited and consecutive, for example Q♥ J♥. These hands are considered stronger than average because they have the highest potential to form straights and flushes when combined with the community cards.

In Texas hold&#x27;em, suited connectors play well against multiple players when they can see the flop for cheap. Experienced players will generally not raise with them, because raising usually causes a few players to fold, decreasing the pot odds in the event of a straight or flush draw on the flop. However, a hand like ace-king suited might do well to raise because the cards will also work well if they pair, which is the more likely possibility, so the pot odds are less important.

== Suited connectors in cash games ==
Suited connectors can be especially effective in deep stack poker. An experienced player might call a loose player when he raises and re-raises with suited connectors in an attempt to win a big pot. Large stacks increase the value of suited connectors because of larger implied odds. In tournament play, where the stacks are normally shallow, suited connectors are very marginal hands. The idea behind playing suited connectors is that they will mostly be folded on the flop, but when they hit a quality draw or a made hand, a player should be looking to win all or a large portion of the opponent&#x27;s stack. In &quot;Harrington on Cash Games&quot;, a chapter is dedicated on explaining the poker paradox: &quot;Big hands&quot; such as AA and KK tend to win small pots, and &quot;small hands&quot; such as 4♠ 3♠ tend to win big pots, simply because the small hands create well-concealed monsters and will only continue when they hit.

== Suited gappers ==
Non-consecutive suited pocket cards which are nonetheless close enough to each other in value that they can form a straight on the flop are generally referred to as a &quot;suited gapper.&quot; For example, A♠ 3♠ is a suited 1-gapper and 5♦ 9♦ is a suited 3-gapper. In general, suited gappers are not as strong as suited connectors because they have a lower likelihood of making a straight.

== Probability ==
Suited connectors and suited gappers have a higher chance of making a straight or straight draw on the flop than non-connected hands.

The table shows the probability of hitting each outcome.

There are two main factors that influence the chance of a straight:
*Higher card outs: A hand that is jack-high has a higher chance of making a straight than a hand that is ace-high. This is due to the jack-high being able to include cards higher than itself as outs.
*Low straights: A hand that includes an ace can make a high straight: 10-J-Q-K-A or a low straight: A-2-3-4-5. This causes an ace-ten hand to have a higher straight draw probability than a king-nine hand.
