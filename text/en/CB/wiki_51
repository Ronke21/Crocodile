<text>Bloc Party are an English rock band that was formed in London in 1999 by co-founders Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, sampler) and Russell Lissack (lead guitar, synthesizers). Their first four albums all featured Gordon Moakes (bass) and Matt Tong (drums), who have since left the band. Their current lineup also contains Louise Bartle (drums, percussion) and Harry Deacon (bass, synthesizers). Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. 

Upon their formation at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack, the band went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in &quot;NME&quot; magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s Alex Kapranos a copy of their demo &quot;She&#x27;s Hearing Voices&quot;.

In February 2005, the band released their debut album &quot;Silent Alarm&quot;. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and &quot;NME&quot; Album of the year which both honour indie music. That year, the record was also certified platinum in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot;, which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, &quot;Intimacy&quot; which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. 

The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, &quot;Four&quot;, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled &quot;The Nextwave Sessions&quot; in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Hymns&quot;, the first to involve Justin Harris (bass) and Louise Bartle (drums), was released on 29 January 2016. Their sixth studio album, &quot;Alpha Games&quot;, was released on 29 April 2022. On 21 July 2023, they released the &quot;High Life&quot; EP. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide.

==History==

===Formation and rising popularity (1999–2004)===
Russell Lissack and Kele Okereke first met in 1998 in London. Lissack had attended Bancroft&#x27;s School, while Okereke attended Ilford County High School, then Trinity Catholic High School, Woodford Green for sixth form. They bumped into each other again in 1999 at Reading Festival and decided to form a band. Bassist Gordon Moakes joined after answering an advert in &quot;NME&quot;, and drummer Matt Tong joined after an audition. After going through a variety of names, such as Union, The Angel Range, and Diet, the band settled on Bloc Party in September 2003, a play on &quot;block party&quot;. The band has said that the name was not intended to be an allusion to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Québécois. However, Moakes said on the group&#x27;s official Internet forum that it was more a merging of the eastern &quot;Blocs&quot; and the western &quot;parties&quot;, in the political sense. He also notes that the name was not explicitly driven by politics, but rather it &quot;looked, sounded, seemed fine so we went with it.&quot;

In November 2003, Bloc Party had their track &quot;The Marshals Are Dead&quot; featured on a compilation CD called &quot;The New Cross&quot; released by Angular Recording Corporation. They then released their debut single &quot;She&#x27;s Hearing Voices&quot; on the then fledgling record label Trash Aesthetics. Also in 2003 Bloc Party personally mailed Steve Aoki a 7-inch of the track “She’s Hearing Voices” and signed to Dim Mak shortly thereafter. Dim Mak teamed up with VICE, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, and entered a major label deal for the first time. Dim Mak and Atlantic later released Bloc Party&#x27;s critically acclaimed and commercially successful Silent Alarm in 2005. The band got their break after Okereke went to a Franz Ferdinand concert in 2003, and gave a copy of &quot;She&#x27;s Hearing Voices&quot; to both lead singer Alex Kapranos and BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq. Lamacq subsequently played the song on his radio show, labelling the track &quot;genius&quot;, and invited them to record a live session for the show. The buzz generated off the back of the single led to another release, &quot;Banquet/Staying Fat&quot;, this time through Moshi Moshi Records, and to the eventual signing with independent label Wichita Recordings in April 2004.

===&quot;Silent Alarm&quot; (2004–2006)===
Bloc Party&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Silent Alarm&quot;, was released in February 2005 and was met with universal critical acclaim. It was voted &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; for 2005 by &quot;NME&quot;, and reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart before being certified platinum. The first single from the album, &quot;So Here We Are/Positive Tension&quot;, made the top 5 on the UK Top 40 chart. Further singles &quot;Banquet&quot; (which reached number 13 in &quot;NME&#x27;&quot;s &#x27;Top 50 Singles of 2005&#x27;), &quot;Helicopter&quot;, and &quot;Pioneers&quot;, whilst failing to repeat this success, still managed to reach the UK top 20. The animated video for &quot;Pioneers,&quot; made by the Shoreditch-based Minivegas design agency, was top of the &quot;NME&quot; video charts for four weeks. &quot;NME&quot; tagged them as &quot;art-rock&quot; at that time but the band felt it was too limited.

The band received positive reviews from critics in the United States and they toured there heavily in the 18 months that followed the release of &quot;Silent Alarm&quot;. In early 2006, they finished their tour with sold-out shows in Los Angeles, Miami and Berkeley. The album went on to sell more than 350,000 copies in North America and over a million worldwide. After this success, the established electronic group, The Chemical Brothers, soon collaborated with Okereke for &quot;Believe&quot;, a track on their &quot;Push the Button&quot; album. An album of remixes of tracks from &quot;Silent Alarm&quot; had also been released at the end of August 2005 in the UK. This remix album, entitled &quot;Silent Alarm Remixed&quot;, retained the album&#x27;s original track list and includes remixes from the likes of Ladytron, M83, Death from Above 1979, Four Tet, and Mogwai.

During July 2005, Bloc Party recorded two new tracks with &quot;Silent Alarm&quot; producer Paul Epworth. The songs were released as a single with a B-side, titled &quot;Two More Years&quot;, to coincide with the band&#x27;s October 2005 UK tour. The tour was also accompanied by a re-issue of &quot;Silent Alarm&quot;, which included &quot;Two More Years&quot; and former single &quot;Little Thoughts&quot; as bonus tracks. A remix of &quot;Banquet&quot; by The Streets, as well as a music video for the song, were included in the &quot;Two More Years&quot; single. Bloc Party also contributed the track &quot;The Present&quot; to the &quot;Help!: A Day in the Life&quot; compilation, the profits of which benefited the War Child charity.

===&quot;A Weekend in the City&quot; (2006–2008)===
Bloc Party&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot;, was produced by Garret &quot;Jacknife&quot; Lee. It was released in February 2007, although it was leaked in November 2006. It became available for download on the UK iTunes Store before the physical release, and reached the number 2 spot on the UK Albums Chart. The album also reached number 2 on the Australian and Belgian charts, and debuted at number 12 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 48,000 copies sold. The first single, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, was released on 29 January, and became the band&#x27;s highest charting single in the British Top 40, reaching number 4. In the buildup to the release of the album, BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe aired a live set by the band from Maida Vale studios on 30 January 2007, featuring a mix of old and new songs. On 1 February 2007, &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot; was made available to listen to for free through Bloc Party&#x27;s official MySpace page.

The next single, &quot;I Still Remember&quot;, was Bloc Party&#x27;s highest charting American single, peaking at number 24 on the Modern Rock Chart. The band released their third single, &quot;Hunting for Witches&quot;, with an accompanying video clip in August 2007. The single became their only ARIA Chart entry, peaking at number 20. In October 2007, it was announced that Bloc Party would release a new single, &quot;Flux&quot;, on 13 November—ahead of their end of year gigs. The electronic song, also produced by Jacknife Lee, was very different from previous singles released by the band.

The band&#x27;s first gig following the release of &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot; was on 5 February 2007, in Reading, and was broadcast live on BBC 6 Music. On 20 May 2007, Bloc Party headlined on the &quot;In New Music We Trust&quot; stage at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend in Preston. They also performed at the UK leg of Live Earth on 7 July 2007 at Wembley Stadium. Furthermore, the band played sets at T in the Park and Oxegen 07 that same weekend, as well as Glastonbury and the Reading and Leeds Festivals later in 2007. Bloc Party announced a tour of Australia and New Zealand in August 2007, which would include a special appearance at the Splendour in the Grass Festival on 5 August. On 17 September 2007, they recorded a set for the PBS show Austin City Limits a day after playing at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. On 27 October, the band performed a set at London&#x27;s The Roundhouse with the Exmoor Singers, a London-based choir, as part of the BBC Electric Proms. The set included songs from both &quot;Silent Alarm&quot; and &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot; along with the first British live performance of &quot;Flux&quot;.

===&quot;Intimacy&quot; (2008–2009)===
&quot;Mercury&quot; was released as the first single from Bloc Party&#x27;s third album in August 2008. Again produced by Jacknife Lee and Paul Epworth, &quot;Intimacy&quot; was rush-released later that month, with the album available to download 3 days after an announcement in August 2008. Later in the month the band played second on the bill at the Reading and Leeds Festivals before headlining the Hydro Connect Music Festival in Argyll, Scotland.

During the autumn of 2008, the band went on a short tour of North America, which included an appearance at the Virgin Festival in Toronto, as well as the band&#x27;s first ever American college show at Syracuse University and an appearance at the 2008 edition of MTV Video Music Brazil, their first concert in South America, which was negatively received due to the band choosing to mime their performance. They made their live return to the UK on 30 September 2008 with a special gig in London as part of Q Awards: The Gigs. They also played the Glasgow date of MTV2&#x27;s and Topman&#x27;s &quot;Gonzo on Tour&quot; on 19 October 2008. A follow-up single, &quot;Talons&quot; was released in October 2008. The song was not part of the pre-order album, but did feature on the full album CD release and was made freely available to people who already purchased the download-only album. An album of remixes of all tracks on &quot;Intimacy&quot;, &quot;Intimacy Remixed&quot;, was released in May 2009.
The band undertook their first UK tour since December 2007 in October 2009, dubbing it &quot;Bloctober&quot;.

===&quot;One More Chance&quot; and hiatus (2009–2011)===
In July 2009, Okereke stated that the band did not have a current recording contract and had no obligation or pressure to release a new album in the foreseeable future; he went on to suggest that the release of a fourth album was on an indefinite timescale. A new single, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, was released in August 2009. The song did not appear on &quot;Intimacy&quot; and was produced by Jacknife Lee. After this, the group went on a hiatus, with the members unsure as to whether they would carry on.

During this period of hiatus Lissack revived his project Pin Me Down and joined the live line-up of Irish rock-band Ash as guitarist and synthesiser player on their touring for the &quot;A–Z Series&quot;. Moakes formed the group Young Legionnaire with Paul Mullen, vocalist &amp; guitarist of The Automatic, and William Bowerman, drummer for La Roux, releasing a single, &quot;Colossus&quot; in August 2010. Okereke released a solo album, &quot;The Boxer&quot;, in June 2010. Produced by Hudson Mohawke and XXXChange, its release was preceded by the single &quot;Tenderoni&quot;. Rumours throughout 2011 suggested Okereke had left the group to focus on solo work, though these were denied by other band members.

===&quot;Four&quot; and &quot;The Nextwave Sessions&quot; (2011–2013) === 
Bloc Party started writing material for a fourth album in 2011, but decided not to play live. In the meantime Okereke finished an EP titled &quot;The Hunter&quot;. The group stated they intended to release a new album in 2012. In May 2012, Bloc Party announced &quot;Four&quot;, which was released on 20 August 2012, after being made available to stream in its entirety for over a week preceding release. The album was recorded with Alex Newport, who had previously worked with At the Drive-In and The Mars Volta, in New York City. Bloc Party released &quot;Octopus&quot; that July and later released another single entitled &quot;Day Four&quot;. The band released &quot;Kettling&quot; on 12 November 2012, followed by &quot;Truth&quot; on 25 February 2013. &quot;Four&quot; peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and at number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The band debuted new material during their 2013 North American tour, including &quot;Children of the Future&quot; at Rams Head Live!, &quot;Ratchet&quot; at The Pageant, &quot;Montreal&quot; at the Ogden Theatre and &quot;X-cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot; at Mr. Smalls Theater in Pittsburgh. Lissack later confirmed the band&#x27;s plans to release a new EP in &quot;northern hemisphere summer&quot;. He told Marc Zanotti of Australian website MusicFeeds that the new material was &quot;not like a continuation of the record we&#x27;ve just made, it&#x27;s a completely separate thing [...] the next step; the next progression&quot;. &quot;French Exit&quot; was given its debut live performance at Crystal Ballroom on 24 May. Some of the new material would feature on &quot;The Nextwave Sessions&quot;, an EP announced on 25 June and for release on 12 August via Frenchkiss Records.

=== Hiatus and line-up changes (2013–2015) ===
During the summer tour of 2013, drummer Matt Tong left the band. Lissack told a Canadian newspaper, the &quot;National Post&quot; that the band were planning to take an indefinite hiatus following their appearance at the Latitude Festival on 19 July. In October 2013, Kele assembled a DJ Mix for !K7&#x27;s &quot;Tapes&quot; mix series, released under the Bloc Party name. In September 2014, Okereke stated that Bloc Party were working on a fifth album. In March 2015, bassist Gordon Moakes tweeted he had parted ways with Bloc Party. Following the departure of their former members, Okereke and Lissack started to work on new songs on their own in late 2014. 

At the time, the departures of Moakes and Tong were shrouded in rumour and innuendo. Okereke alluded to drugs being an issue on multiple occasions, after he had to intervene during a Bloc Party performance. He told The Guardian: &quot;There’s a song where somebody makes a mistake and … well, I guess Gordon makes a mistake. And I say something to him, and he kind of responds, and I realised at that point that this was as far as our relationship was gonna go. I’ve never interfered with anyone’s performance before, and I thought that if that was the state of our relationship, it felt fitting that this should be our last show together.” Before the article was published Okereke told NME that “I can tell you it was about someone doing cocaine and someone not being into it. That’s all I’m gonna say.&quot; Before publication Okereke contacted The Guardian to address his comments to NME saying the &#x27;someone&#x27; he referenced was a person around the band, not actually in the band: “This then led to a big argument and that’s the situation,” he says. “I don’t want people to think Matt and Gordon were cokeheads, and that’s why we had to lose them. And I don’t want their families thinking that.”

Bloc Party unveiled their new line-up at two intimate gigs in the Los Angeles area (19 August 2015 at The Glass House in Pomona and 20 August 2015 at The Roxy in Los Angeles). Following these performances, Bloc Party also subheadlined FYF Fest in Los Angeles on 22 August 2015. At these shows, the band confirmed that they&#x27;ve finished recording their next album. The shows marked the live debut for new bassist Justin Harris of the Portland, Oregon, indie rock outfit Menomena, who had previously opened several Bloc Party U.S. tour dates in April 2009; and Louise Bartle, who was accidentally announced a month earlier as Bloc Party&#x27;s drummer by instrument manufacturer Natal Drums in a since-deleted tweet, leading to fan speculation regarding her membership that was ultimately proved correct. These shows also included the first performances of two new songs called &quot;Eden&quot; and &quot;Exes&quot; according to the setlist.

===&quot;Hymns&quot; and &quot;Silent Alarm Live&quot; (2015–2019)===

In a performance at Maida Vale, Bloc Party gave &quot;The Good News&quot; its live debut; hours later, &quot;The Love Within&quot; was featured as &quot;Hottest Record in the World&quot; by Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1. Okereke revealed the band&#x27;s upcoming fifth album is set to be titled &quot;Hymns&quot;. The album&#x27;s release was later confirmed on social media as 29 January 2016.

Later in 2016, the band released the standalone single &#x27;Stunt Queen&#x27; to mark their performance at the Hollywood Bowl, which Okereke claimed was a &quot;significant milestone&quot; for the band. It marks some of the first new material that featured Justin and Louise as co-writers.

March 2018 saw the band announce a series of shows touring their &#x27;Silent Alarm&#x27; album which would be played in full. Due to the success of this short tour, Bloc Party announced further dates in 2019 again playing tracks from the whole of their debut.

===&quot;Alpha Games&quot; and &quot;The High Life EP&quot; (2020–present)===
On 22 January 2020, Okereke announced on his personal social media accounts that Bloc Party had begun writing a new album. On 22 September 2021, Bloc Party posted to their official Twitter account a sneak peek of the tracklist/recording progress of their soon to be released sixth studio album.

On 23 November 2021, Bloc Party released the first single &quot;Traps&quot; off their sixth studio album &quot;Alpha Games&quot;. The album was released on 22 April 2022. A second single &quot;The Girls Are Fighting&quot; was released on 26 January 2022 and the responding music video was released on 28 January 2022. On 25 February 2022, the third single &quot;Sex Magik&quot; was released. A fourth single, &quot;If We Get Caught&quot;, was released on 24 March 2022.

In October 2022, it was announced Bloc Party would be supporting Paramore during their 2023 UK and Ireland tour, as well as their North American tour as announced the following month. During the tour&#x27;s London stop, Okereke duetted with Hayley Williams on a cover of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Blue Light&quot;.

On 21 June 2023, Bloc Party announced a new EP titled &quot;The High Life EP&quot;, which was released a month later on 21 July. It was preceded by the singles &quot;High Life&quot; and &quot;Keep It Rolling&quot;, the latter of which featuring KennyHoopla, which were released on 21 April 2023 and 2 June 2023 respectively. Justin Harris did not participate in the EP&#x27;s recording, with bass and keyboard parts instead handled by Skindred&#x27;s Daniel Pugsley. Later in 2023, Harris was officially replaced by Palace bassist Harry Deacon.

In June 2024, the band released a stand-alone single entitled &quot;Flirting Again&quot;. On 22 November 2024, Bloc Party officially released &quot;A Weekend In The City: B-Sides&quot;. The demos and b sides had been available online for years previously, sometimes referred to as &quot;Another Weekend in the City&quot;, but had never seen an official release. The same day, the band removed the album from streaming, stemming from audio quality concerns. They were re-released on 20 December 2024.

==Musical style==

Bloc Party&#x27;s musical style has been described as indie rock, post-punk revival, post-Britpop, alternative rock, art punk, art rock, dance-rock, and alternative dance. Early on, Bloc Party&#x27;s sound was shaped primarily by American alternative rock bands Smashing Pumpkins and Weezer. Other influences included the Chemical Brothers, Pixies, Joy Division, Sonic Youth and the Smiths. Both Kele Okereke and Russell Lissack have been influenced by Britpop acts, particularly Blur, though Okereke also cites Suede and particularly their album &quot;Dog Man Star&quot; as an inspiration. Okereke has also stated that Mogwai&#x27;s album &quot;Mogwai Young Team&quot; changed his life by being his musical &quot;year zero&quot;. Particular parallels were made between Bloc Party and Gang of Four upon their arrival on the music scene, yet the band were &quot;mildly infuriated&quot; at such references, claiming they had never &quot;particularly liked&quot; Gang of Four. 

To achieve their unique style, numerous delay and other effects pedals are implemented. During the recording of second album &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot;, the band suggested it would contain &quot;some truly R&amp;B styled beats, a song where [Tong] and [Moakes] play drums simultaneously [with] both eggshell-thin fragility and trouser-flapping hugeness&quot;, as opposed to their typical sound. The style has been compared to and inspired by such bands as Radiohead, U2, Depeche Mode, and Björk. Some of the most noticeable changes between debut &quot;Silent Alarm&quot; and &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot; are that the songs became more layered and less raw due to inclusion of string arrangements.

With the release of &quot;Flux&quot;, Bloc Party&#x27;s style became even more diverse with the inclusion of electronic music. &quot;Mercury&quot; saw Bloc Party distance themselves even further from the traditional guitar band set-up by experimenting with dark electronic sounds and a brass section inspired by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Intimacy&quot; also features synths, processed drum beats and loops, vocal manipulation, and choral arrangements. Even though the album was influenced by electronic music, the band still had not lost their feel for guitar music. For example, in an interview, Okereke said that the band was starting to miss their more traditional sound, and confirmed that may have been the way fourth album was headed. However, Tong contradicted this, stating: &quot;There&#x27;s every chance we might go back to more orthodox arrangements or things that resemble a traditional band but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever write songs like we did on &quot;Silent Alarm&quot; again.&quot;

<text>This article contains persons named in the Bible, specifically in the Hebrew Bible, of minor notability, about whom little or nothing is known, aside from some family connections. Here are the names which start with A-K; for L-Z see there.

== A ==
===Abagtha===

Abagtha (Hebrew אֲבַגְתָא) was a court official or eunuch of king Ahasuerus who was commanded along with 6 other officials to parade queen Vashti to go before the king. (Esther 1:10) 

===Abda===

The name Abda (Hebrew עַבְדָּא) means &quot;servant,&quot; or perhaps is an abbreviated form of &quot;servant of YHWH&quot;. There are two people by this name in the Hebrew Bible.

*An Abda mentioned in passing when Solomon set Adoniram son of Abda in charge of forced labor for Solomon&#x27;s building projects (1 Kings 4:6). 
*A Levite of the family of Jeduthun (Nehemiah 11:17), also called Obadiah (1 Chronicles 9:16). He was the son of Shammua and served in Jerusalem under Nehemiah.

Where the Masoretic Text has &quot;Abda,&quot; the Septuagint, depending on the location and manuscript, has names such as &quot;Abao, Ephra, Edram, Ioreb, Obeb,&quot; and &quot;Abdias.&quot;

=== Abdeel ===
Abdeel (Hebrew עַבְדְּאֵל &quot;servant of God&quot;; akin to Arabic عبد الله &quot;Abdullah&quot;) is mentioned in Jeremiah 36:26 as the father of Shelemiah, one of three men who were commanded by King Jehoiakim to seize the prophet Jeremiah and his secretary Baruch. The Septuagint omits the phrase &quot;and Shelemiah son of Abdeel&quot;, probably a scribal error due to homoioteleuton.

===Abdi===
The name Abdi (Hebrew עַבְדִּי) is probably an abbreviation of Obediah, meaning &quot;servant of YHWH&quot;, according to the &quot;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia&quot;. &quot;Easton&#x27;s Bible Encyclopedia&quot;, on the other hand, holds that it means &quot;my servant&quot;. The name &quot;Abdi&quot; appears three times in forms of the Bible that are in use among Jews, Protestants, and Roman Catholics. There is also one additional appearance in 1 Esdras, considered canonical in Eastern Orthodox Churches.
# 1 Chronicles 6:29: &quot;And on the left hand their brethren the sons of Merari: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch.&quot; This verse, in the King James Version and some other Bibles, is verse 44 of chapter 6.
# 2 Chronicles 29:12. &quot;Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah.&quot;
# Ezra 10:26. &quot;And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah.&quot;
# 1 Esdras 9:27, where the name appears in the Hellenized form &quot;Oabd[e]ios.&quot; &quot;Of the sons of Elam: Matthanias and Zacharias and Iezrielos and Obadios and Ieremoth and Elias.&quot;

Where the Hebrew text reads &quot;Avinadav&quot;, Greek manuscripts of the Septuagint read &quot;Am(e)inadab&quot; or &quot;Abin&quot;. but Brenton&#x27;s translation of the Septuagint reads &quot;Abinadab&quot;.

Adino (Hebrew עֲדִינוֹ) was an Eznite and one of David&#x27;s mighty men found in 2 Samuel 23:8.. He is identified with Jashobeam and the name does not occur in other translations in the Bible. Ginsburg offers a corrected form taken substantially from the parallel passage in 1 Chronicles 11:11: &quot;Jashobeam a son of a Hachmonite, chief of the captains; he lifted up his spear.&quot; This is plausible, and is very generally accepted, and eliminates the names Adino and Eznite, which do not occur elsewhere in the Bible. Some of the facts are against this. The Septuagint has the names Adino and Eznite. The Latin finds no proper names in the passage, but so translates the words as to presuppose the Hebrew text as we have it. It may be a case for suspended judgment.

===Agee===
Agee (Hebrew אָגֵא) was the father of Shammah, who was one of David&#x27;s mighty men (2 Samuel 23:11). Based on interpretations of 1 Chronicles 11:34 and 2 Samuel 23:32–33 Agee was either the grandfather of Jonathan or his brother.

Ginath is a name which is mentioned only in passing in a narrative describing the struggle for kingship between Omri and Tibni. Tibni is referred to in 1 Kings 16:21 and 22 as &quot;son of Ginath,&quot; which taken literally, could be read as implying that a person named Ginath was Tibni&#x27;s father. However, the &quot;Encyclopaedia Biblica&quot; suggests that the term &quot;Ginath&quot; is a place-name or clan-name, so that &quot;Tibni son of Ginath&quot; has the meaning &quot;Tibni of Ginath.&quot;

===Haahashtari===
Haahashtari or Ahashtari was one of the sons of Naarah, one of the two wives of Asshur (1 Chronicles 4:6). Because the name is used to refer to a family of Judahites who descend from Judah via Ashhur, Thomas Kelly Cheyne believed that the name &quot;Haahashtari&quot; arose from a confusion between &quot;Ha-Ashhuri&quot; (&quot;the Ashhurite&quot;) with the obscure term &quot;ahashtranim&quot; which appears in Esther 8:10.

===Habaiah===

Habaiah (also called Hobaiah or Obdia) was the name given to a priestly family mentioned in Ezra 2:61: the &quot;b&#x27;ne habayah&quot; (literally &quot;sons/descendants of Habaiah&quot;). Along with the families Hakkoz and Barzillai, the Habaiah family were priests whose names were not registered in the official genealogical records. As a result, Ezra ruled that their rights to serve as priests would be restricted until such time as a high priest could decide, using the oracular Urim and Thummim, whether they had divine approval to serve as priests.

The name &quot;Habaiah&quot; means &quot;Yahweh hides&quot; or &quot;Yahweh protects,&quot; and appears in manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint in the forms &quot;Labeia,&quot; &quot;Obaia,&quot; &quot;Odogia,&quot; &quot;Ebeia,&quot; &quot;Ab(e)ia,&quot; &quot;Obbeia,&quot; and &quot;Obdia.&quot; 

===Habazziniah===
Habazziniah or Habaziniah was either the head of a family of Rechabites (Jeremiah 35:3), or else a place name for the location that a Rechabite lived.

<text>Ulai was the Hebrew name for a river near the city of Susa. It was known as Eulaeus (ancient greek Εὔλαιος or Εὐλαῖος) to the Greeks. It is mentioned twice in the Bible:
*Daniel – &quot;&quot;In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.&quot; (New International Version)
*Daniel – &quot;And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai calling, &#x27;Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision. &quot;

In the Koine Greek Septuagint, the earliest Old Greek translation of the Old Testament, in the Book of Daniel Eulaeus (ancient greek Εὔλαιος or Εὐλαῖος) is transformed and apeears as Οὐβάλ (πρὸ τοῦ Οὐβάλ Book of Daniel 8:3, ἐνώπιον τοῦ Οὐβὰλ Book of Daniel 8:15 and ἀναμέσον τοῦ Οὐβάλ Book of Daniel 8:16). 

The river Ulai is also mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh: &quot;May the sacred river u-la-a mourn you [Endiku], along whose banks we walked in our vigor&quot; (VIII-11-12). More details are available at www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Ulai.html.

There are three watercourses near Susa, and scholars are divided on which is indicated, although archaeology by Loftus in 1851 and Dieulafoy in 1885 helped shed some light. The Ulai may have been the eastern branch of the Karkheh River (alternately called Choaspes river, in ancient greek Χοάσπης), which at one time divided into two branches some 20 miles north-west of the city. Another possible location of this river is the Coprates tributary of the Karun River. Finally, some claim an artificial canal which ran close by Susa and connected the two rivers mentioned above.

<text>Hinduism is a minority religion in South America, which is followed by even less than 1% of the total continent&#x27;s population. Hinduism is found in several countries, but is strongest in the Indo-Caribbean populations of Guyana and Suriname. There are about 320,000 Hindus in South America, chiefly the descendants of Indian indentured laborers in the Guianas. There are about 185,000 Hindus in Guyana, 120,000 in Suriname, and some others in French Guiana. In Guyana and Suriname, Hindus form the second largest religion and in some regions and districts, Hindus form the majority. Though in recent times, due to influence of Hindu culture the number of Hindus converts have increased in other countries in South America, including Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and others.

== Presence by country ==

===Argentina===
There were about 34,460 Hindus (0.08% of the country) in 2015. Many Hindus are Indo-Caribbeans from Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname.

Argentina has 2,030 people of Indian origin and 1,300 non-resident Indians. Some of them still refer to ayurveda, practice yoga and enjoy Indian classical music.

They have established an Indian Association in the northern provinces and organize social and cultural events to celebrate Indian festivals. There is little interaction between them and those who have settled down in other parts of the extensive country.

A large number of the Indian diaspora living in Buenos Aires are businessmen, doctors, financial
or business executives, and employees of multinational corporations. Most of them have retained their Indian citizenship.

=== Brazil ===

According to the 2011 census, there are about 9,500 Hindus in Brazil constituting 0.005% of the population of Brazil.
Most of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East Indians. However, there are new converts due to the missionary effects of Hare Krishnas and Academia Brasileira de Astrologia Védica.

A small number of Sindhis that arrived from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of Manaus is considered to be the first wave of immigration. The second wave consisted of university professors who arrived in the 1960s and also in the 1970s.

===Chile===
A few Indians had gone to Chile in the 1920s. The others migrated there about 30 years ago — not only from India, but also from Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Nigeria, Panama, the Philippines and Singapore.

The Hindu Community in Chile comprises more than 1400 members. Among these, 400 people (90 families) lives in the Capital city Santiago.

Most of the Hindus in Chile are Sindhis. There is a Hindu Temple in Punta Arenas which provide services in both Sindhi and Spanish.

Besides Punta Arenas, the Indian business community is also present in Santiago, the capital of Chile, and Iquique. The activities of businessmen in Santiago are mainly confined to imports and retail stores.

As of 2020, there were about 930 Hindus in Chile according to the ARDA.

===Colombia===

Hinduism in Colombia was mainly introduced with the arrival of Indians, especially Indian migrant workers from Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. There are ISKCON (&quot;The Hare-Krishnas&quot;) centers in the capital, Bogota.

===French Guiana===

Most of the Hindus in French Guiana are of Surinamese origin. According to the 2000 census 1.6% of the total population (3,200 out of 202,000) were Hindu.

===Guyana===
About 84% of the East Indian immigrants were Hindu. During the indenture period, the East Indian caste system broke down. Christian missionaries attempted to convert East Indians during the indenture period, beginning in 1852, but met with little success. The missionaries blamed the Brahmins for their failure: the Brahmins began administering spiritual rites to all Hindus regardless of caste once the Christian missionaries started proselytizing in the villages, hastening the breakdown of the caste system. After the 1930s, Hindu conversions to Christianity slowed because the status of Hinduism improved and the discrimination against Hindus diminished.

In areas where there are large percentage of Indo Guyanese residing together — Mandirs of various sizes can be found, according to the population. All main Hindu occasions are observed — Basant Panchami in January to Gita Jayanti in December.

Since the late 1940s, reform movements caught the attention of many Guyanese Hindus. The most important, the Arya Samaj movement, arrived in Guyana in 1910. Arya Samaj doctrine rejects the idea of caste and the exclusive role of Brahmins as religious leaders. The movement preaches monotheism and opposition to the use of images in worship as well as many traditional Hindu rituals. Approximately between 216,000 and 230,000 identified themselves as Hindus in the 2002 census.

===Paraguay===
In the 2002 census, it was estimated that about 551 Hindus live in Paraguay. They make up 0.01% of Paraguay&#x27;s population. Paraguay&#x27;s ambassador to India, Genaro Vicente Pappalardo, gave Punjab farmers a high opportunity to invest in the country. Most of the Hindus live in Asunción.

===Peru===
The first ‘Indian Indians’ to have arrived in Peru were businessmen who had gone there in the early 1960s. Later on, the community grew in number marginally until the early 80s, after which many of its members left due to the severe local economic crises and the prevailing terrorism. Those with relatives in other Latin countries joined them.

In the recent past, the size of the community has remained stable. There is a small remnant of the original ‘native Indians’ in this country who still maintain their traditional culture and religious beliefs.

Most members of the local Indian community are Sindhis. They are reasonably well-off, but very few can be regarded as prosperous. Their general level of education is low. Most of them speak only their mother tongue and Spanish, with a smattering of English.

There is also here a small number of professionals from other parts of India. Residence permits are not difficult to obtain in Peru. But citizenship is more complicated and only a small number of Indians have obtained it – not more than 10 out of a total of almost forty people. While a few cultural activities are organized by the more enterprising people of Indian origin, in general they maintain a low profile. Considering the vast distance that separates the community from India, its interest in its country of origin is limited to major events, mainly derived from occasional browsing on the internet. But being invariably first generation migrants, many of them do occasionally visit India.

===Suriname===
The story of Hinduism in Suriname is broadly parallel to that in Guyana. Indian indentured labourers were sent to colonial Dutch Guiana by special arrangement between the Dutch and British. The difference is that the Netherlands&#x27; more liberal policy toward Hinduism allowed the culture to develop stronger. Examples are the lack of a rigid caste system and the almost universal reading of Gita and Ramayan.

According to the 2012 census of Suriname, Hindus constitute 22.3% of the population. Hindus are mostly concentrated in Northern coastal regions of Suriname: Nickerie, Wanica and Saramacca, where they constitute the largest religious group. There are several Hindu temples in Suriname.

===Uruguay===

There are a few Yoga organizations in Uruguay, which spread Indian thought and philosophy-prominent among them are, Sivapremananda Ashram of the Divine Society. A portion of the beach in Montevideo has been named after Mahatma Gandhi and a bust of Gandhiji installed in one of the parks along the beach. There is a school named after him in Montevideo, a street and another school named after Republic of India. There is a small Indian community in Uruguay consisting of 300 members approx.

===Venezuela===
During the oil-related high-income years of the 1970s, there were around 400 non-resident Indians in the country. There are also several thousand of Indo-Caribbeans from Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana in the cities of Ciudad Guayana and Caracas.

The Indian community consisted of personnel from the petroleum and petrochemical sectors, as well as a large number of traders. Many of them had taken their families with them to Venezuela, whether from India or elsewhere. Most of the traders belonged to the Sindhi community but there were also some people from Gujarat, Punjab and the southern Indian States.

When the oil boom ended in 1982, followed by devaluation of the local currency, many of the non-resident Indians decided to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Currently, the Diaspora has been whittled down to half its former size. There are now only about 45 Indian families in Venezuela who are mainly engaged in retail trade. There are also a small number of experts in high tech. industries such as telecommunications.

All of them have adapted themselves very well to their country of residence and are generally held in high regard by the local people on account of their hard work, expertise and non-political nature.

The Venezuelan Constitution guarantees equal rights without discrimination to all expatriate personnel. This has facilitated the Indian community&#x27;s life.

Another interesting feature is that many local people are interested in Indian religions and spirituality.

Some members of the Indian community also attend their functions. Most of the non-resident Indians are well educated. However, given their small numbers, they have not formed themselves into an active representative body. But they remain in touch with one another and with the Indian Embassy in Caracas. Even though they have little time to engage in numerous cultural activities, they do
get together to celebrate Indian festivals like Diwali.

On the whole, the Indian community in Venezuela is quite prosperous and has a per capita income that is above the national average that is itself as high as US$8,300 in terms of PPP. They take an active part in mobilising donations to help in alleviating distress at times of national calamities in India.

In 2010, there were 580 Hindus in Venezuela according to the Association of Religion Data Archives.

<text>Unni is used as a first name in Kerala, India. In the Malayalam language, it is also used as an adjective meaning an infant boy. Thus, Unnikrishnan or Unnikannan means Lord Krishna in the infant form and Unniyesu means (Jesus in Malayalam) in the infant form. The word is also the name of a caste among Hindus in the Southern India State of Kerala.
==Surname==
The name Unni is also used as a surname by various sub-groups of Pushpaka Brahmins like Pushpakanunnis, Theeyattunnis and Pattarunnis (Karappuram Unni or Nattuppattar). There is a common belief that Unnis are sub-divided into Pushpakanunnis, Theeyattunnis and Pattarunnis. In fact these are entirely different communities in a common class of Kerala Brahmins and there were no inter caste marriages among these communities anciently.

==History==
Thiyattunnis were traditionally the performers of an ancient art form called Tīyāttu. The famous Malayalam writer Kottarathil Sankunni was a Tīyāttunni whereas famous essayist D. Padmanabhan Unni was a Pushpakanunni. Thiyattunnis have the right for Tantric Poojas and other privileges enjoyed by the Nambudiri caste.

<text>Uphaz () is probably another name for Ophir (Book of Jeremiah 10:9).

Some, however, regard it as the name of an Indian colony in Yemen, southern Arabia; others as a place on or near the river Hyphasis (now the Beas), the south-eastern limit of the Punjab or more correctly among the rivers and mountains of Kerala, India.

<doc id="819720" wikidata="Q610859" url="?curid=819720" title="Economic sociology">
<text>Economic sociology is the study of the social cause and effect of various economic phenomena. The field can be broadly divided into a classical period and a contemporary one, known as &quot;new economic sociology&quot;.

The classical period was concerned particularly with modernity and its constituent aspects, including rationalisation, secularisation, urbanisation, and social stratification. As sociology arose primarily as a reaction to capitalist modernity, economics played a role in much classic sociological inquiry. The specific term &quot;economic sociology&quot; was first coined by William Stanley Jevons in 1879, later to be used in the works of Émile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel between 1890 and 1920. Weber&#x27;s work regarding the relationship between economics and religion and the cultural &quot;disenchantment&quot; of the modern West is perhaps most representative of the approach set forth in the classic period of economic sociology.

Contemporary economic sociology may include studies of all modern social aspects of economic phenomena; economic sociology may thus be considered a field in the intersection of economics and sociology. Frequent areas of inquiry in contemporary economic sociology include the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct.

==Classical==
Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena; emphasizing particularly the role of economic structures and institutions that play upon society, and the influence a society holds over the nature of economic structures and institutions. The relationship between capitalism and modernity is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber&#x27;s &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; (1905) and Simmel&#x27;s &quot;The Philosophy of Money&quot; (1900). Economic sociology may be said to have begun with Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835–40) and &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot; (1856). Marx&#x27;s historical materialism would attempt to demonstrate how economic forces influence the structure of society on a fundamental level. Émile Durkheim&#x27;s &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot; was published in 1922, whilst Max Weber&#x27;s &quot;Economy and Society&quot; was released in the same year.

==Contemporary==
Contemporary economic sociology focuses particularly on the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct. Influential figures in modern economic sociology include Fred L. Block, James S. Coleman, Paula England, Mark Granovetter, Harrison White, Paul DiMaggio, Joel M. Podolny, Lynette Spillman, Richard Swedberg and Viviana Zelizer in the United States, as well as Carlo Trigilia, Donald Angus MacKenzie, Laurent Thévenot and Jens Beckert in Europe. To this may be added Amitai Etzioni, who has developed the idea of socioeconomics, and Chuck Sabel, Wolfgang Streeck and Michael Mousseau who work in the tradition of political economy/sociology.

The focus on mathematical analysis and utility maximisation during the 20th century has led some to see economics as a discipline moving away from its roots in the social sciences. Many critiques of economics or economic policy begin from the accusation that abstract modelling is missing some key social phenomenon that needs to be addressed.

Economic sociology is an attempt by sociologists to redefine in sociological terms questions traditionally addressed by economists. It is thus also an answer to attempts by economists (such as Gary Becker) to bring economic approaches – in particular utility maximisation and game theory – to the analysis of social situations that are not obviously related to production or trade. Karl Polanyi, in his book &quot;The Great Transformation&quot;, was the first theorist to propose the idea of &quot;embeddedness&quot;, meaning that the economy is &quot;embedded&quot; in social institutions which are vital so that the market does not destroy other aspects of human life. The concept of &quot;embeddedness&quot; serves sociologists who study technological developments. Mark Granovetter and Patrick McGuire mapped the social networks which determined the economics of the electrical industry in the United States. Ronen Shamir analyzed how electrification in Mandatory Palestine facilitated the creation of an ethnic-based dual-economy. Polanyi&#x27;s form of market skepticism, however, has been criticized for intensifying rather than limiting the economization of society.

===New economic sociology===
A contemporary period of economic sociology, often known as &quot;new economic sociology&quot;, was consolidated by the 1985 work of Mark Granovetter titled &quot;Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness&quot;. These works elaborated the concept of embeddedness, which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). Social network analysis has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter&#x27;s theory of the strength of weak ties and Ronald Burt&#x27;s concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field.

==Marxist sociology==

Modern Marxist thought has focused on the social implications of capitalism (or &quot;commodity fetishism&quot;) and economic development within the system of economic relations that produce them. Important theorists include Georg Lukács, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Guy Debord, Louis Althusser, Nicos Poulantzas, Ralph Miliband, Jürgen Habermas, Raymond Williams, Fredric Jameson, Antonio Negri, and Stuart Hall.

==Socioeconomics==
Economic sociology is sometimes synonymous with socioeconomics. Socioeconomics deals with the analytical, political and moral questions arising at the intersection between economy and society from a broad interdisciplinary perspective with links beyond sociology to political economy, moral philosophy, institutional economics and history.

==Academic associations==
The Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics (SASE) is an international academic association whose members are involved in social studies of economy and economic processes. The &quot;Socio-Economic Review&quot; was established as the official journal of SASE in 2003. The journal aims to encourage work on the relationship between society, economy, institutions and markets, moral commitments and the rational pursuit of self-interest. Most articles focus on economic action in its social and historical context, drawing from sociology, political science, economics and the management and policy sciences. According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 1.926, ranking it 56th out of 344 journals in the category &quot;Economics&quot;, 21st out of 163 journals in the category &quot;Political Science&quot; and 19th out of 142 journals in the category &quot;Sociology&quot;.

The American Sociological Association&#x27;s Economic Sociology section became a permanent Section in January 2001. According to its website, it has about 800 members.

Another group of scholars in this area works as Research Committee in Economy and Society (RC02) within the International Sociological Association.

Economic Sociology and Political Economy (ES/PE), founded in 2011, is an online scholarly society that gathers researchers interested in economic sociology and related topics.

<text>George Brown Petty IV (April 27, 1894 – July 21, 1975) was an American pin-up artist. His pin-up art appeared primarily in &quot;Esquire&quot; and Fawcett Publications&#x27;s &quot;True&quot; but was also in calendars marketed by &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;True&quot; and Ridgid Tool Company. Petty&#x27;s &quot;Esquire&quot; gatefolds originated and popularized the magazine device of centerfold spreads. Reproductions of his work, known as &quot;Petty Girls,&quot; were widely rendered by military artists as nose art decorating warplanes during the Second World War, including the &quot;Memphis Belle.&quot;

== Birth and early career==
George Petty was born in Abbeville, the seat of Vermilion Parish in south Louisiana to George Brown Petty III and his wife, Sarah. George, IV, was the couple&#x27;s second child; his sister Elizabeth had been born in 1891. The Petty family moved to Chicago, Illinois, just before the turn of the century, where George, III, a photographer of some note, enjoyed considerable success with images of young women, madonnas, and nudes.

Petty was not a particularly good student in high school, spending a great deal of time on extracurricular activities instead of schoolwork. His artistic bent first became obvious in high school, where he was the staff artist for the school newspaper.

During his high school years, he enrolled in evening classes at Chicago Academy of Fine Arts under the tutoring of Ruth VanSickle Ford, where he taught his own art course, charging classmates $5.00 per session. He also worked in his father&#x27;s photo shop where he learned how to use an airbrush. In Paris, Petty studied art at the Académie Julian with Jean-Paul Laurens and others until 1916, when World War I caused Myron T. Herrick, ambassador at that time, to order all Americans to return home.

Petty returned to Chicago, and worked as an airbrush retoucher for a local printing company. He was able to establish himself as a freelance artist, painting calendar girls and magazine covers for &quot;The Household&quot;. By 1926, he was able to open his own studio.

== Artistic influences ==
George Petty never discussed in detail those artists who influenced him, other than J. C. Leyendecker (an artist for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; during George&#x27;s high school days) for his interpretation of men, Coles Phillips for his technique, and Maxfield Parrish for his use of light. However, it can be inferred from his later work that other influences included artists who were extremely popular in Paris at the time, such as Alfons Mucha, George Barbier and, in particular, the watercolor technique of Britain&#x27;s William Russell Flint.

== &quot;The Petty Girl&quot; ==
Petty is especially known for &quot;the Petty Girl&quot;, a series of pin-up paintings of women done for &quot;Esquire&quot; from its first issue in 1933 until 1956. Petty frequently depicted these women with the relative lengths of their legs being longer—and the relative sizes of their heads being smaller—than those of his actual models.

George Petty used his daughter as the model for an optional hood ornament, &quot;Flying Lady&quot; available on the Nash automobiles in the early 1950s.

Petty appeared as a guest on the popular TV program &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on November 20, 1955.

Petty died in San Pedro, California, on July 21, 1975.

==In popular culture==

* An image of a Petty Girl talking on a phone was used as the &quot;nose art&quot; on the famous World War II B-17 Flying Fortress, &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;.
* In 1959 a vector rendition of a Petty Girl derived from a 1956 Esquire calendar was displayed as part of the diagnostics for a SAGE air defense computer. This is claimed to be &quot;earliest known figurative computer art&quot;.
* Two images of &quot;Petty Girls&quot; were used in the crowd on The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover.
* Robert Cummings portrayed George Petty in the imaginary musical comedy &quot;The Petty Girl&quot; (Columbia, 1950), directed by Henry Levin and featuring the film debut of Tippi Hedren as one of the Petty Girls. Nat Perrin&#x27;s screenplay was based on a story by Mary McCarthy. The film is also notable for several lilting, lighthearted songs composed by Harold Arlen (music) and Johnny Mercer (lyrics), including &quot;Fancy Free&quot; and &quot;I Loves Ya&quot;. The large production number at the finale is &quot;The Petty Girl&quot; by Arlen and Mercer, performed by Joan Caulfield (dubbed by Carole Richards), the Petty Girls and a male quartet.

== Sources ==
Reid Stewart Austin (&quot;The Best of Gil Elvgren&quot;) examined the life and art of George Petty in the 192-page &quot;Petty: The Classic Pin-Up Art of George Petty&quot;. Published by Gramercy in 1997, the lavish volume features a foreword by Hugh Hefner and an introductory essay by Petty&#x27;s daughter, Marjorie Petty, who was his main model. In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, famed designer George Lois praised this collection of Petty&#x27;s creations, commenting:
Just as the cool, unapproachable Gibson Girl was the feminine ideal of young men at the turn of the century, the voluptuous Petty Girl became the ideal of their wide-eyed sons. I&#x27;m going on the record to swear that George Brown Petty IV consistently created better-designed women than God, and now I&#x27;ve got a big beautiful book to prove it.

<text>BrikWars is a free miniatures wargaming system by Mike Rayhawk, created for use with plastic building blocks and figurines. It is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing for its players&#x27; full range of creativity in creating armies, creatures, vehicles, and worlds out of construction toys.

Although targeted primarily at adults, &quot;BrikWars&quot; is known for its straight-faced acceptance of the kinds of ridiculous scenarios and multi-genre mashups that arise naturally when children dump out their unsorted toybins on the floor. Much of its humor comes from satirizing &quot;serious&quot; wargames and their players, while flouting or deliberately misinterpreting conventions of the genre.

A physical release of the game published by Modiphius Entertainment was announced in 2023.

== Play mechanics ==
&quot;BrikWars&quot; uses &quot;minifigs&quot; (usually Lego minifigures or equivalent miniature figures from other construction toy brands) as small soldiers, and terrain constructed from construction bricks or random objects found near the playing area. While the game can be played with non-construction-toy-related objects, such as action figures, stuffed animals, or chessmen, the rules lend themselves best to figures and structures which can be easily disassembled and reconstructed. These models might represent real or imaginary forces and situations, but are just as likely to represent exactly what they are - toys engaging in arbitrary battles for toy supremacy.

&quot;BrikWars&quot; is a turn-based skirmish-level miniatures wargame. Each player in the game controls forces custom-built from construction toys or whatever materials they have at hand. The creations are assigned attributes according to the current size and features of the physical models at any given moment.

Players take turns, with each player moving and attacking with each of their units able to do so, before passing the turn to the next player in sequence. This continues until each player or team has succeeded or failed in their objectives, or until players agree that the battle is over. Normally each unit is able to move once (a number of inches based on its &quot;Move&quot; statistic) and take a single major action (usually to make an attack, or to use one of its special abilities known as a &quot;Specialty&quot;) in a given turn, in addition to any number of minor actions. Units have lots of options such as: withholding its action that turn, to be able use that action in response to Enemy action; sprinting; charging; bailing or forming up into a squad.

For determining the success or failure of actions and attacks, each unit is assigned an appropriately sized polyhedral die for its Action attribute, which it must roll against a set number determined by the difficulty of the act. When an attack successfully hits, the attacker rolls their weapon&#x27;s Damage dice in the hopes of overcoming the target&#x27;s Armor stat. Most infantry units are killed by having their Armor overcome once, while larger vehicles and structures are more resilient and may take multiple hits (with their abilities correspondingly degraded) before being destroyed.

The rules also encourage players to disobey the rules as often as possible, as seen in the &quot;Law of &quot;, and for special Hero units who can attempt to ignore the rules completely once per turn with a Heroic . The rulebook repeatedly encourages fun over obsessive rules-lawyering, with an emphasis on making the game as enjoyable as possible for all parties involved.

== History ==
&quot;Legowars&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;BrikWars&quot;, was invented in March 1991 by Eric O&#x27;Dell and R. Todd Ogrin. &quot;Legowars&quot; featured space-themed combat between Lego minifigures, and was distinguished from other miniature wargames of the time by a strong building-brick construction theme allowing the customization of playing pieces. It was followed in January 1995 by a sequel, &quot;Legowars II&quot;.

In October 1995, the authors of &quot;Legowars&quot; received a cease and desist order from the Lego Group for their improper usage of the trademarked word &quot;Lego&quot;. As Steve Jackson describes it:

So Ogrin and O&#x27;Dell removed their content, but others archived it (adding legal disclaimers). Meanwhile, Mike Rayhawk started work on what would become &quot;BrikWars&quot;:
 
In February 1997 Rayhawk formally announced BrikWars on rec.toys.lego. BrikWars has been in continual development ever since.

==Reception==
&quot;BrikWars&quot; is part of a wider movement of homebrew wargames based on Lego and other children&#x27;s building block toys, including Evil Stevie&#x27;s Pirate Game by Steve Jackson. According to The Escapist, &quot;BrikWars&quot; is a &quot;standout LEGO tabletop effort&quot; in this scene.

Reviewing it on Boardgamegeek, Luke Mason emphasized the economy of &quot;taking all those hundreds of unused LEGOs sitting around and adding stats and rules to them so you can have a real wargame with them.&quot;; as well as its &quot;flexible and affordable (if rough in design)&quot; design. He summarizes his views as:

<doc id="819738" wikidata="Q1130516" url="?curid=819738" title="Millennium Park">
<text>Millennium Park is a public park located in the Loop community area of Chicago, operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. The park, opened in July 2004, is a prominent civic center near the city&#x27;s Lake Michigan shoreline that covers a section of northwestern Grant Park. Featuring a variety of public art, outdoor spaces and venues, the park is bounded by Michigan Avenue, Randolph Street, Columbus Drive and East Monroe Drive. In 2017, Millennium Park was the top tourist destination in Chicago and in the Midwest, and placed among the top ten in the United States with 25 million annual visitors.

Planning of the park, situated in an area occupied by parkland, the Illinois Central rail yards, and parking lots, began in October 1997. Construction began in October 1998, and Millennium Park opened in a ceremony on July 16, 2004, four years behind schedule. The three-day opening celebrations were attended by some 300,000 people and included an inaugural concert by the Grant Park Orchestra and Chorus. The park has received awards for its accessibility and green design. Millennium Park has free admission, and features the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, &quot;Cloud Gate&quot;, the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot;, the Lurie Garden, and various other attractions. The park is connected by the BP Pedestrian Bridge and the Nichols Bridgeway to other parts of Grant Park. Because the park sits atop parking garages, the commuter rail Millennium Station and rail lines, it is considered the world&#x27;s largest rooftop garden. In 2015, the park became the location of the city&#x27;s annual Christmas tree lighting.

Some observers consider Millennium Park the city&#x27;s most important project since the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150 million. The final cost of $475 million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270 million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility for the cost overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Nonetheless, architectural and urban planning critics have praised the completed park.

==Background==

From 1852 until 1997, the Illinois Central Railroad owned a right of way between downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan, in the area that became Grant Park and used it for railroad tracks. In 1871, Union Base-Ball Grounds was built on part of the site that became Millennium Park; the Chicago White Stockings played home games there until the grounds were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire. Lake Front Park, the White Stockings&#x27; new ball grounds, was built in 1878 with a short right field due to the railroad tracks. The grounds were improved and the seating capacity was doubled in 1883, but the team had to move after the season ended the next year, as the federal government had given the city the land &quot;with the stipulation that no commercial venture could use it&quot;. Daniel Burnham planned Grant Park around the Illinois Central Railroad property in his 1909 Plan of Chicago. Between 1917 and 1953, a prominent semicircle of paired Greek Doric-style columns (called a peristyle) was placed in this area of Grant Park (partially recreated in the new Millennium Park). In 1997, when the city gained airspace rights over the tracks, it decided to build a parking facility over them in the northwestern corner of Grant Park. Eventually, the city realized that a grand civic amenity might lure private dollars in a way that a municipal improvement such as ordinary parking structure would not, and thus began the effort to create Millennium Park. The park was originally planned under the name Lakefront Millennium Park.

The park was conceived as a landscape-covered bridge over an underground parking structure to be built on top of the Metra/Illinois Central Railroad tracks in Grant Park. The parks overall design was by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, and gradually additional architects and artists such as Frank Gehry and Thomas Beeby were incorporated into the plan. Sponsors were sought by invitation only.
In February 1999, the city announced it was negotiating with Frank Gehry to design a proscenium arch and orchestra enclosure for a bandshell, as well as a pedestrian bridge crossing Columbus Drive, and that it was seeking donors to cover his work. At the time, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; dubbed Gehry &quot;the hottest architect in the universe&quot; in reference to the acclaim for his Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and they noted the designs would not include Mayor Richard M. Daley&#x27;s trademarks, such as wrought iron and seasonal flower boxes. Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said &quot;Frank is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture,&quot; and noted that no other architect was being sought. Gehry was approached several times by Skidmore architect Adrian Smith on behalf of the city. His hesitance and refusal to accept the commission was overcome by Cindy Pritzker, the philanthropist, who had developed a relationship with the architect when he won the Pritzker Prize in 1989. According to John H. Bryan, who led fund-raising for the park, Pritzker enticed Gehry in face-to-face discussions, using a $15 million funding commitment toward the bandshell&#x27;s creation. Having Gehry get involved helped the city realize its vision of having modern themes in the park; upon rumors of his involvement the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; proclaimed &quot;Perhaps the future has arrived&quot;, while the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; noted that &quot;The most celebrated architect in the world may soon have a chance to bring Chicago into the 21st Century&quot;.
Plans for the park were officially announced in March 1998 and construction began in September of that year. Initial construction was under the auspices of the Chicago Department of Transportation, because the project bridges the railroad tracks. However, as the project grew and expanded, its broad variety of features and amenities outside the scope of the field of transportation placed it under the jurisdiction of the city&#x27;s Public Buildings Commission.

In April 1999, the city announced that the Pritzker family had donated $15 million to fund Gehry&#x27;s bandshell and an additional nine donors committed $10 million. The day of this announcement, Gehry agreed to the design request. In November, when his design was unveiled, Gehry said the bridge design was preliminary and not well-conceived because funding for it was not committed. The need to fund a bridge to span the eight-lane Columbus Drive was evident, but some planning for the park was delayed in anticipation of details on the redesign of Soldier Field. In January 2000, the city announced plans to expand the park to include features that became &quot;Cloud Gate&quot;, the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot;, the McDonald&#x27;s Cycle Center, and the BP Pedestrian Bridge. Later that month, Gehry unveiled his new winding design for the bridge.

Mayor Daley&#x27;s influence was key in getting corporate and individual sponsors to pay for much of the park. Bryan, the former chief executive officer (CEO) of Sara Lee Corporation who spearheaded the fundraising, says that sponsorship was by invitation and no one refused the opportunity to be a sponsor. One &quot;Time&quot; magazine writer describes the park as the crowning achievement for Mayor Daley, while another suggests the park&#x27;s cost and time overages were examples of the city&#x27;s mismanagement. The July 16–18, 2004, opening ceremony was sponsored by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.

The community around Millennium Park has become one of the most fashionable and desired residential addresses in Chicago. In 2006, Forbes named the park&#x27;s 60602 zip code as the hottest in terms of price appreciation in the country, with upscale buildings such as The Heritage at Millennium Park (130 N. Garland) leading the way for other buildings, such as Waterview Tower, The Legacy and Joffrey Tower. The median sale price for residential real estate was $710,000 in 2005 according to Forbes, also ranking it on the list of most expensive zip codes. The park has been credited with increasing residential real estate values by $100 per square foot ($1,076 per m2).

==Features==

Millennium Park is a portion of the Grant Park, known as the &quot;front lawn&quot; of downtown Chicago, and has four major artistic highlights: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, &quot;Cloud Gate&quot;, the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot;, and the Lurie Garden. Millennium Park is successful as a public art venue in part due to the grand scale of each piece and the open spaces for display. A showcase for postmodern architecture, it also features the McCormick Tribune Ice Skating Rink, the BP Pedestrian Bridge, the Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance, Wrigley Square, the McDonald&#x27;s Cycle Center, the Exelon Pavilions, the AT&amp;T Plaza, the Boeing Galleries, the Chase Promenade, and the Nichols Bridgeway.

Millennium Park is considered one of the largest green roofs in the world, having been constructed on top of a railroad yard and large parking garages. The park, which is known for being user friendly, has a very rigorous cleaning schedule with many areas being swept, wiped down or cleaned multiple times a day. Although the park was unveiled in July 2004, some features opened earlier, and upgrades continued for some time afterwards. Along with the cultural features above ground (described below) the park has its own 2218-space parking garage.

===Jay Pritzker Pavilion===
The centerpiece of Millennium Park is the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, a bandshell designed by Frank Gehry. The pavilion has 4,000 fixed seats, plus additional lawn seating for 7,000; the stage is framed by curving plates of stainless steel, characteristic of Gehry. It was named after Jay Pritzker, whose family is known for owning Hyatt Hotels and was a major donor. The Pritzker Pavilion is Grant Park&#x27;s outdoor performing arts venue for small events, and complements Petrillo Music Shell, the park&#x27;s older and larger bandshell. The pavilion is built partially atop the Harris Theater for Music and Dance, the park&#x27;s indoor performing arts venue, with which it shares a loading dock and backstage facilities. The pavilion is seen as a major upgrade from the Petrillo Music Shell for those events it hosts. Initially, the pavilion&#x27;s lawn seats were free for all concerts, but this changed when Tori Amos performed the first rock concert there on August 31, 2005.

The Pritzker Pavilion is the home of the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and the Grant Park Music Festival, the nation&#x27;s only remaining free, municipally supported, outdoor, classical music series. The Festival is presented by the Chicago Park District and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. The Pavilion hosts a wide range of other music series and annual performing arts events. Performers ranging from mainstream rock bands to classical musicians and opera singers have appeared at the pavilion, which also hosts physical fitness activities such as yoga. All rehearsals at the pavilion are open to the public; trained guides are available for the music festival rehearsals, which are well-attended.

The construction of the pavilion created a legal controversy, given that there are historic limitations on buildings in Grant Park. To avoid these legal restrictions, the city classifies the bandshell as a work of art rather than a building. With several design and assembly problems, the construction plans were revised over time, with features eliminated and others added as successful fundraising allowed the budget to grow. In the end, the performance venue was designed with a large fixed seating area, a Great Lawn, a trellis network to support the sound system, and a headdress fashioned from signature Gehry stainless steel. It features a sound system with an acoustic design that replicates an indoor concert hall sound experience. The pavilion and Millennium Park have received favorable recognition by critics, especially for their accessibility; an accessibility award ceremony held at the pavilion in 2005 described it as &quot;one of the most accessible parks—not just in the United States but possibly the world&quot;.

===Grainger Plaza and Cloud Gate===
The Grainger Plaza (formerly AT&amp;T Plaza) is a public space that hosts the &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; sculpture. The plaza opened in July 2004 with the unveiling of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park. Ameritech donated $3 million for the naming right for the plaza, but it was SBC Plaza when the park opened, as a merger had changed the company name to SBC Communications. The 2005 merger of SBC and AT&amp;T Corporation led to the name AT&amp;T Plaza. In 2021, the Grainger Foundation established a $5 million endowment to support the ongoing enhancement of the plaza (now called Grainger Plaza) and Cloud Gate. The sculpture and the Grainger Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink. The plaza has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink. During the holiday season, the plaza hosts Christmas caroling.

&quot;Cloud Gate&quot;, dubbed &quot;The Bean&quot; by Chicagoans because of its legume-like shape, is a three-story reflective steel sculpture. The first public artwork in the United States by world-renowned artist Anish Kapoor, the privately funded piece cost $23 million, considerably more than the original estimate of $6 million. Composed of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It is and weighs . Its smooth shape and mirror-like surface were inspired by liquid mercury. It reflects the city skyline, particularly the historic Michigan Avenue &quot;streetwall&quot;, and the sky. It provides striking reflections of visitors, who can walk around and under its high arch. On the underside is the &quot;omphalos&quot; (Greek for &quot;navel&quot;), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor&#x27;s artistic themes, and is a popular photo subject with tourists.

After Kapoor&#x27;s design for the sculpture was selected in a design competition, numerous technological concerns regarding its construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns about the sculpture&#x27;s upkeep and maintenance. Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture&#x27;s construction fell behind schedule. &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration, as the grid of welds around each metal panel was still visible. The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed; in early 2005, workers polished out the seams. &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and it has since gained considerable popularity, domestically and internationally.

===Crown Fountain===
The &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; is an interactive work of public art and video sculpture, named in honor of Chicago&#x27;s Crown family and opened in July 2004. It was designed by Catalan conceptual artist Jaume Plensa and executed by Krueck and Sexton Architects. The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of transparent glass brick towers. The towers are tall, and use light-emitting diodes behind the bricks to display digital videos on their inward faces. Construction and design of the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; cost $17 million.

Weather permitting, the water operates from May to October, intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower&#x27;s front face. To achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects&#x27; mouths, each video has a segment where the subject&#x27;s lips are puckered, which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water, reminiscent of gargoyle fountains; this happens roughly every five minutes. The park and fountain are open to the public daily from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.

Residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features. It highlights Plensa&#x27;s themes of dualism, light, and water, extending the use of video technology from his prior works. The fountain promotes physical interaction between the public and the water in an artistic setting. Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their universal design.

The &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; has been the most controversial of all the Millennium Park features. Before it was built, some were concerned that the sculpture&#x27;s height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park. New concerns were raised after the construction when the surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain, which led to a public outcry (and their quick removal). However, the fountain has survived its somewhat contentious beginnings to find its way into Chicago pop culture. It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place. While some of the videos displayed are of scenery, most attention has focused on its video clips of local residents, in which almost a thousand Chicagoans randomly appear on two screens. The fountain is a public play area and offers people an escape from summer heat, allowing children to frolic in the fountain&#x27;s water.

===Lurie Garden===
The Lurie Garden is a public garden located at the southern end of Millennium Park; designed by landscape architecture firm GGN (Gustafson Guthrie Nichol), Piet Oudolf, and Robert Israel, it opened on July 16, 2004. The garden is a combination of perennials, bulbs, native prairie grasses, shrubs and trees. It is the featured nature component of the world&#x27;s largest green roof. The garden cost $13.2 million and has a $10 million financial endowment for maintenance and upkeep. It was named after philanthropist Ann Lurie, who donated the $10 million endowment. The garden is a tribute to the city, whose motto is &quot;Urbs in Horto&quot;, Latin for &quot;City in a Garden&quot;. The Lurie Garden is composed of two &quot;plates&quot;. The dark plate depicts Chicago&#x27;s history by presenting shade-loving plants, and has a combination of trees that will provide a shade canopy for these plants when they fill in. The light plate, which has no trees, represents the city&#x27;s future with sun-loving perennials that thrive in heat and light.

===McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink and Park Grill===
The McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink is a multipurpose venue located along the western edge of Millennium Park opposite the streetwall of the Historic Michigan Boulevard District. On December 20, 2001, it became the first attraction in Millennium Park to open, a few weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground parking garage. The $3.2 million plaza was funded by a donation from the McCormick Tribune Foundation. For four months a year, it operates as McCormick Tribune Ice Rink, a free public outdoor ice skating rink. It is generally open for skating from mid-November until mid-March and hosts over 100,000 skaters annually. It is known as one of Chicago&#x27;s better outdoor people watching locations during the winter months. The rink is operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs rather than the Chicago Park District, which operates most major public ice skating rinks in Chicago.

For the rest of the year, it serves as The Plaza at Park Grill or Park Grill Plaza, Chicago&#x27;s largest al fresco dining facility. The 150-seat outdoor restaurant offers scenic views of the park, and hosts various culinary events and musical performances during its months of operation. From June 21 to September 15, 2002, the plaza served as an open-air exhibition space and hosted the inaugural exhibit in Millennium Park, &quot;Exelon Presents Earth From Above&quot; by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, a French aerial photographer.

The Park Grill Plaza is affiliated with the 300-seat indoor Park Grill restaurant, located beneath the Grainger Plaza and &quot;Cloud Gate&quot;. The Park Grill is the only full-service restaurant in Millennium Park and opened on November 24, 2003. It regularly places among the leaders in citywide best-of competitions for best burger, and it is widely praised for its views. The restaurant has been the focus of controversies about the numerous associates of Mayor Daley who are investors, its exclusive location and lucrative contract terms. One of the most financially successful restaurants in Chicago, the Park Grill remains exempt from property taxes after a multi-year litigation which reached the appellate courts in Illinois.

===BP Pedestrian Bridge===
The BP Pedestrian Bridge is a girder footbridge over Columbus Drive that connects Millennium Park with Maggie Daley Park (formerly, Daley Bicentennial Plaza), both parts of the larger Grant Park. The pedestrian bridge is the first bridge Gehry designed to be built, and was named for BP plc, which donated $5 million to the construction of the park. It opened on July 16, 2004, along with the rest of Millennium Park. Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and eventually agreed to do so after the Pritzker family funded the Pavilion. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry&#x27;s style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction. The bridge is referred to as snakelike in character due to its curving form. The bridge&#x27;s design, which meets highway standards to accommodate rushes of pedestrian traffic simultaneously exiting Pritzker Pavilion events, enables it to bear a heavy load.

The pedestrian bridge serves as a noise barrier for the pavilion, blocking traffic sounds from Columbus Drive. It is a connecting link between Millennium Park and destinations to the east, such as the nearby lakefront, other parts of Grant Park and a parking garage. The BP Bridge uses a concealed box girder design with a concrete base, and its deck is covered by hardwood floor boards. It is designed without handrails, using stainless steel parapets instead. The total length is , with a five percent slope on its inclined surfaces that makes it barrier-free and accessible. It has won awards for its use of sheet metal. Although the bridge is closed in winter because ice cannot be safely removed from its wooden walkway, it has received favorable reviews for its design and aesthetics.

===Harris Theater===
The Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance is a 1525-seat theater for the performing arts located along the northern edge of Millennium Park. Constructed in 2002–03, it is the city&#x27;s premier performance venue for small- and medium-sized performance groups, which had previously been without a permanent home and were underserved by the city&#x27;s performing venue options. The theater, which is largely underground due to Grant Park-related height restrictions, was named for its primary benefactors, Joan and Irving Harris.
It serves as the park&#x27;s indoor performing venue, a compliment to Jay Pritzker Pavilion, which hosts the park&#x27;s outdoor performances. Among the regularly featured local groups are the Joffrey Ballet, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and Chicago Opera Theater. It provides subsidized rental, technical expertise, and marketing support for the companies using it, and turned a profit in its fourth fiscal year.

The Harris Theater has hosted notable national and international performers, such as the New York City Ballet, which made its first visit to Chicago in over 25 years (in 2006). The theater began offering subscription series of traveling performers in its 2008–09 fifth anniversary season. Performances through this series have included the San Francisco Ballet, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Stephen Sondheim.

The theater has been credited as contributing to the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and it has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although it is seen as a high-caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups, because it is more expensive and larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater&#x27;s prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high-priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.

===Wrigley Square===
Wrigley Square is a public square located in the northwest corner of Millennium Park near the intersection of East Randolph Street and North Michigan, across from the Historic Michigan Boulevard District. It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full-sized replica of the semicircle of paired Greek Doric-style columns (called a peristyle) that originally sat in this area of Grant Park between 1917 and 1953. The square also contains a large lawn and a public fountain. The William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation contributed $5 million for the monument and square, which was named in its honor. The pedestal of the Millennium Monument&#x27;s peristyle is inscribed with the names of the 115 financial donors who made the 91 contributions of at least $1 million each to help pay for Millennium Park.

===McDonald&#x27;s Cycle Center===
The McDonald&#x27;s Cycle Center is a 300-space heated and air conditioned indoor bike station located in the northeast corner of Millennium Park. The facility provides lockers, showers, a snack bar with outdoor summer seating, bike repair, bike rental and other amenities for downtown bicycle commuters and utility cyclists. The bike station also accommodates runners and in-line skaters, and provides space for a Chicago Police Department Bike Patrol Group. The city-built center opened in July 2004 as the Millennium Park Bike Station; since June 2006, it has been sponsored by McDonald&#x27;s and several other partners, including city departments and bicycle advocacy organizations. Suburban Chicago-based McDonald&#x27;s sponsorship of the Cycle Center fit in well with its efforts to help its customers become more healthy by encouraging &quot;balanced, active lifestyles&quot;. The Cycle Center is accessible by membership and day pass.

Planning for the Cycle Center was part of the larger &quot;Bike 2010 Plan&quot;, in which the city aimed to make itself more accommodating to bicycle commuters. This plan (since replaced by the &quot;Bike 2015 Plan&quot;) included provisions for front-mounted two-bike carriers on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city. Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area&#x27;s other mass transit providers, Metra and Pace, have developed increased bike accessibility. Mayor Daley was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic. Environmentalists, urban planners and cycling enthusiasts around the world have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate what they see as a success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond Chicago have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; notes that it is revered as &quot;a kind of Shangri-La&quot;, and describes it as &quot;a jewel-like glass building on the Chicago waterfront, [that] has many of the amenities of an upscale health club ... close to the heart of the city&quot;, with the additional statement that &quot;It&#x27;s not heaven, but it&#x27;s close&quot;. A Vancouver official told &quot;The Oregonian&quot; that it was &quot;the ultimate in bicycle stations&quot;, and would be natural for bicycle friendly cities to emulate.

===Exelon Pavilions===
The Exelon Pavilions are a set of four solar energy-generating structures in Millennium Park. The pavilions provide sufficient energy to power the equivalent of 14 Energy star-rated energy-efficient houses in Chicago. The pavilions were designed in January 2001 and construction began in January 2004. The Southeast and Southwest Exelon Pavilions (jointly the South Exelon Pavilions) along Madison Street were completed and opened in July 2004, and flank the Lurie Garden. The Northeast and Northwest Exelon Pavilions (jointly the North Exelon Pavilions) flank the Harris Theater along Randolph Street and were completed in November 2004, with a grand opening on April 30, 2005. Besides producing energy, three of the four pavilions provide access to the park&#x27;s underground parking garages and the fourth serves as the park&#x27;s welcome center. Exelon, a company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison, donated approximately $6 million for the pavilions.

===Boeing Galleries===
The Boeing Galleries are a pair of outdoor exhibition spaces within Millennium Park; they are located along the south and north mid-level terraces, above and east of Wrigley Square and the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot;. They were added after the park opened; in March 2005, Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer James Bell announced the firm would make a $5 million grant to fund construction of the spaces, and for an endowment to &quot;help fund visual arts exhibitions&quot; in them. The galleries, which were built between March and June 2005, have hosted grand-scale art exhibits, some of which have run for two full summers.

===Chase Promenade===
The Chase Promenade is an open-air tree-lined pedestrian walkway in Millennium Park that opened July 16, 2004. The promenade was made possible by a gift from the Bank One Foundation; Bank One merged with JPMorgan Chase in 2004, and the name became Chase Promenade. The walkway accommodates exhibitions, festivals and other family events. It also serves as a private-event rental venue. The Chase Promenade hosted the 2009 Burnham Pavilions, which were the cornerstone of the citywide Burnham Plan centennial celebration.

===Nichols Bridgeway===
The Nichols Bridgeway, a pedestrian bridge that opened on May 16, 2009, connects the south end of Millennium Park with the Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago. The bridge begins at the southwest end of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion&#x27;s Great Lawn and extends across Monroe Street, where it connects to the third floor of the Art Institute&#x27;s West Pavilion. The bridge design by Renzo Piano, the architect of the Modern Wing, was inspired by the hull of a boat.

The Nichols Bridgeway is approximately long and wide. The bottom of the bridge is made of white, painted structural steel, the floor is made of aluminum planking and the tall railings are steel set atop stainless steel mesh. The bridge features anti-slip walkways and heating elements to prevent the formation of ice. It meets standards for universal accessibility, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The bridge is named after museum donors Alexandra and John Nichols.
==Budget==
During development and construction of the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell&#x27;s proposed budget was $10.8 million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings to be driven into the bedrock to support the added weight, the cost of the bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3 million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500 million.

Mayor Daley at first placed much of the blame for the delay and cost overrun on Frank Gehry, who designed the pavilion and its connecting bridge; Daley&#x27;s office later apologized to the architect. A 2001 investigative report by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the park then under construction and its budget overruns as an &quot;expensive public-works debacle that can be traced to haphazard planning, design snafus and cronyism&quot;. According to Lois Weisberg, commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, and James Law, executive director of the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Special Events, once the full scope of the project was finalized the project was completed within the revised budget.

==Use==
Millennium Park had 3 million visitors in its first year; annual attendance was projected to grow to between 3.31 and 3.65 million by 2010. According to &quot;Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business&quot;, however, the park had about 4 million visitors in 2009. In addition to the different uses detailed for each of the permanent features (above), the park has hosted some other notable events, including the annual Grant Park Music Festival, and two temporary pavilions to mark the centennial of Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 Plan of Chicago. Millennium Park has also been featured in several films and television shows.

===Grant Park Music Festival===
The Grant Park Music Festival (formerly Grant Park Concerts) is an annual 10-week classical music concert series, which features the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and the Grant Park Chorus as well as guest performers and conductors. Since 2004, the festival has been housed in the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park. On occasion, the festival has been held at the Harris Theater instead of the Pritzker Pavilion. The festival has earned non-profit organization status, and claims to be the nation&#x27;s only free, outdoor classical music series.

The Grant Park Music Festival has been a Chicago tradition since 1931, when Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak suggested free concerts to lift spirits of Chicagoans during the Great Depression. The tradition of symphonic Grant Park Music Festival concerts began in 1935. The 2004 season, during which the festival moved to the Pritzker Pavilion, was the event&#x27;s 70th season. Formerly, the Grant Park Music Festival was held at the Petrillo Music Shell in Grant Park.

Over time the festival has had various financial supporters, three primary locations and one name change. At times it has been broadcast nationally on the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and Columbia Broadcasting Service (CBS) radio networks, and many of the world&#x27;s leading classical musicians have performed there. In 2000, the festival organizers agreed to release some of the concerts to the public via compact disc recordings.

===Installation of Burnham Pavilions in 2009===
In 2009, architects Zaha Hadid and Ben van Berkel were invited to design and build two pavilions on the Chase Promenade South, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 Plan of Chicago. The pavilions were privately funded and were designed to be temporary structures. They served as the focal point of Chicago&#x27;s year-long celebration of Burnham&#x27;s Plan, and were meant to symbolize the city&#x27;s continued pursuit of the plan&#x27;s architectural vision.

The van Berkel Pavilion was composed of two parallel rectangular planes joined by curving scoops, all built on a steel frame covered with glossy white plywood. It was situated on a raised platform, which was sliced by a ramp entrance, making it ADA accessible. The Hadid Pavilion was a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework made of more than 7,000 pieces. A centennial-themed video presentation was projected on its interior fabric walls after dark.

Both pavilions were scheduled to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, Hadid&#x27;s pavilion was not ready in time; it had construction delays and a construction team change, which led to coverage of the delay in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Only its aluminum skeleton was available for public viewing on the scheduled date; the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion was temporarily closed for repairs August 10–14, due to unanticipated wear and tear. Both pavilions were dismantled after November 1, 2009; the materials from van Berkel&#x27;s were recycled, while Hadid&#x27;s was stored for possible exhibition elsewhere.

===Christmas tree===
In October 2015, the city announced that its official annual Christmas tree lighting, which had been held at Daley Center since 1966 (except for 1982), would be held at the park in order that the official Christmas tree of the city could be closer to ice skating at McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink, the annual Christmas caroling at Cloud Gate and to the new offerings of the nearby Maggie Daley Park. The annual tree raising now occurs in the park near Michigan Avenue and Washington Street. Some parties opposed the move that separated the annual tree from the Christkindlmarket and the &quot;Chicago Picasso&quot;. The city&#x27;s first official tree lighting by Mayor Carter Harrison, Jr. in 1913 had been held in Grant Park on Michigan Avenue two blocks south of the new location.

===In popular culture===
Jeff Garlin claims that &quot;I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With&quot; was the first Hollywood movie to incorporate Millennium Park. The film was not released until 2006, after the release of several other movies. These include the 2005 film &quot;The Weather Man&quot;, which starred Nicolas Cage and was filmed in part at the park&#x27;s McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink. The 2006 romantic comedy &quot;The Break-Up&quot; shot scenes in the park, then had to reshoot some of them because &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; was under cover in some of the initial shots. Other movies which include scenes filmed in Millennium Park include the 2005 thriller &quot;Derailed&quot;, the 2006 romance &quot;The Lake House&quot;, and the 2007 thriller &quot;Butterfly on a Wheel&quot;. At least two television series have filmed in the park, including &quot;Leverage&quot; and &quot;Prison Break&quot;, which featured shots of the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; in the first few episodes of its first season (2005). In the ending scene of &quot;Source Code&quot; (2011), Jake Gyllenhaal&#x27;s and Michelle Monaghan&#x27;s characters are seen walking through Millennium Park, and make their way to the &quot;Cloud Gate&quot;. In the 2012 romantic comedy, &quot;The Vow&quot;, the characters run from the Art Institute of Chicago across the Nichols Bridgeway to Millennium Park, where they kiss under &quot;Cloud Gate&quot;.
The book series Divergent has several events set in the part, with mentions of the Cloud Gate sculpture (referred to as The Bean), the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, as well as the park itself, though it is only referred to as Millennium in the novel. The faction Erudite has their headquarters across from the park in the book series. The park was featured in the 2014 action-adventure video game Watch Dogs.

==Controversy==

===Height restrictions===

In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated, the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city&#x27;s first lots. Foresighted citizens, who wanted the lakefront kept as public open space, convinced the commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between Randolph Street and Park Row (11th Street) &quot;Public Ground—A Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever.&quot; Grant Park has been &quot;forever open, clear and free&quot; since, protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court rulings. In 1839, United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett upon decommissioning the Fort Dearborn reserve, declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue &quot;Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings&quot;.

Aaron Montgomery Ward, who is known both as the inventor of mail order and the protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones. In 1890, arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held easements on the park land, Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free of new buildings. In 1900, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements. In 1909, when Ward sought to prevent the construction of the Field Museum of Natural History in the center of the park, the courts affirmed his arguments.

As a result, the city has what are termed Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park. However, the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; and the Pritzker Pavilion were exempt from the height restrictions, because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, the pavilion is described as a work of art to dodge the protections established by Ward, who is said to continue to rule and protect Grant Park from his grave. The Harris Theater, which is adjacent to Pritzker Pavilion, was built almost entirely underground to avoid the height restrictions. The height of the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot;, which is also exempted as a work of art, has been described as stemming from a &quot;pissing contest&quot; with other park feature artists.

===Financial issues===
The Millennium Park project has been the subject of some criticism since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes. Although the park&#x27;s design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of political favors in the city. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in July 2004 that a contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made contributions to Mayor Daley&#x27;s election campaign. The park&#x27;s full-service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.

Concerns have also been raised over the mixed use of taxpayer and corporate funding and associated naming rights for sections of the park. While a monument in Wrigley Square honors the park&#x27;s many private and corporate donors, many park features are also named for their corporate underwriters, with the sponsors&#x27; names prominently indicated with stone markers (The Boeing Gallery, The Exelon Pavilion, The Grainger Plaza, The Wrigley Square). Some critics have deemed this to be inappropriate for a public space. Julie Deardorff, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; health and fitness reporter, described the naming of the McDonald&#x27;s Cycle Center as a continuation of the &quot; &#x27;McDonaldization&#x27; of America&quot; and as somewhat &quot;insidious&quot; because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from fast food. Timothy Gilfoyle, author of &quot;Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark&quot;, notes that a controversy surrounds the corporate naming of several of the park&#x27;s features, including the BP Bridge, named for an oil company. Naming rights were sold for high fees, and Gilfoyle was not the only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to the highest bidder. Public interest groups have crusaded against commercialization of parks. However, many of the donors have a long history of local philanthropy and their funds were essential to provide necessary financing for several park features.

Ticket prices for both the Harris Theater and the Pritzker Pavilion have been controversial. John von Rhein, classical music critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, notes that the theater&#x27;s size poses a challenge to performers attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events. In 2009–2010, the theater introduced two discounted ticket programs: a $5 lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a $10 ticket program for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90 minutes before performances. Once the pavilion was built, the initial plan was that the lawn seating would be free for all events. An early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said &quot;You never need a ticket to attend a concert! The lawn and the general seating section are always admission free.&quot; However, when parking garage revenue fell short of estimates during the first year, the city charged $10 for lawn seating at the August 31, 2005, concert by Tori Amos. Amos, a classically trained musician who chose only piano and organ accompaniment for her concert, earned positive reviews as the inaugural rock and roll performer in a venue that regularly hosts classical music. The city justified the charge by contending that since the pavilion is an open-air venue, there were many places in Millennium Park where people could have enjoyed the music or the atmosphere of the park without having to pay.

===Use restrictions===
When Millennium Park first opened in 2004 Metra Police stopped a Columbia College Chicago journalism student working on a photography project, and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism. In 2005, &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; attracted some controversy when a professional photographer without a paid permit was denied access to the piece. As is the case for all works of art currently covered by United States copyright law, the artist holds the copyright for the sculpture. The public may freely photograph &quot;Cloud Gate&quot;, but permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art) is required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. Initially the city charged photographers permit fees of $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional videographers and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has been changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and photography requiring 10-person crews.

Almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events in 2005 and 2006. Closing a public park partly paid for with taxpayer money was controversial, as was the exclusion of commuters who walk through the park and tourists lured by its attractions. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent all park venues from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m, except Wrigley Square, the Lurie Garden, the McDonald&#x27;s Cycle Center and the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot;. The city said the money was used to fund day-to-day operations, and for free events in the park, including the Lurie Garden Festival, a Steppenwolf Theater production, musical performers along the Chase Promenade all summer long, a jazz series, and children&#x27;s concerts. The name of Toyota, one of the sponsors, was included on Millennium Park brochures, web site, and advertising signage. The closure provided a public relations opportunity for General Motors, which shuttled 1,500 tourists from the park to see other Chicago attractions. Toyota said it considered $300,000 a rental expense and $500,000 a sponsoring donation. On August 7, 2006, Allstate, which paid $200,000 as a rental expense and $500,000 as a sponsoring donation, acquired the visitation rights to a different set of park features (including Lurie Garden), and only had exclusive access to certain features after 4 p.m.

The park is closed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily. Chicago is a dog-friendly city with a half dozen dog beaches, however the city does not permit dogs in the park. Only on-duty service dogs for the disabled or visually impaired are permitted.

===Surveillance cameras===
In November 2006, the &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; became the focus of a public controversy when the city added surveillance cameras atop each tower. Purchased with a $52 million Department of Homeland Security grant, the cameras augmented eight others covering all of Millennium Park. City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but not Plensa himself. Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras as inappropriate and a blight on the towers. The city said that the cameras would be replaced with permanent, less intrusive models in several months; it contended that the cameras, similar to those used throughout Chicago in high-crime areas and at traffic intersections, had been added largely for security reasons but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out LED lights on the fountain. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published an article on the cameras and the public reaction; the cameras were removed the next day, with Plensa&#x27;s support.

==Reception and recognition==
The &quot;Financial Times&quot; describes Millennium Park as &quot;an extraordinary public park that is set to create new iconic images of the city&quot;, and further notes that it is &quot;a genuinely 21st-century interactive park [that] could trigger a new way of thinking about public outdoor spaces&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine views both &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion as part of a well-planned visit to Chicago. Frommer&#x27;s lists exploring Millennium Park as one of the four best free things to do in the city, and it commends the park for its various artistic offerings. &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; recommends an hour-long stroll to see the park&#x27;s playful art. The park is praised as a &quot;showcase of art and urban design&quot; by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, while &quot;Time&quot; refers to it as an &quot;artfully re-arranged ... civic phantasmagoria like Antonio Gaudí&#x27;s Park Güell in Barcelona, with the difference that this one is the product of an ensemble of creative spirits&quot;. The book &quot;1,000 Places to See in the U.S.A. &amp; Canada Before You Die&quot; describes Millennium Park as a renowned attraction.

The park was designed to be accessible; it only needs a single wheelchair lift and its accessibility won its project director the 2005 Barrier-Free America Award. The McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion both provide accessible restrooms. The park opened with 78 women&#x27;s toilet fixtures and 45 for men, with heated facilities on the east side of the Pritzker Pavilion. It also had about six dozen park benches designed by GGN (Gustafson Guthrie Nichol), the landscape architect responsible for the Lurie Garden. In 2005, the park won the Green Roof Award of Excellence in the Intensive Industrial/Commercial category from Green Roofs for Healthy Cities (GRHC). GRHC considers the park to be one of the largest green roofs in the world; it covers &quot;a structural deck supported by two reinforced concrete cast-in-place garages and steel structures that span over the remaining railroad tracks&quot;. In 2005 the park also received &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;&#x27;s Design Award for &quot;Best Public Space&quot;, and the American Public Works Association&#x27;s &quot;Project of the Year&quot; Award. In its first year, the park, its features and associated people received over 30 awards.

Some mayors from other cities have admired the park as an example of successful urban planning. The mayor of Shanghai enjoyed his visit to the park, and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom wished his city could create a similar type of civic amenity. Closer to home, Blair Kamin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, concluded his 2004 review of Millennium Park with the following: &quot;...a park provides a respite from the city, yet it also reflects the city. In that sense, all of Millennium Park mirrors the rebirth of Chicago ... the ambition of its patrons, the creativity of its artists and architects, and the ongoing miracle of its ability to transform a no place into a someplace that&#x27;s extraordinary.&quot; In 2009, Millennium Park won the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Millennium Park was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois) and was recognized by USA Today Travel magazine, as one of AIA Illinois&#x27; selections for Illinois 25 Must See Places.

<doc id="819778" wikidata="Q2133964" url="?curid=819778" title="Ray Schalk">
<text>Raymond William Schalk (August 12, 1892 – May 19, 1970) was an American professional baseball player, coach, manager and scout. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Sox for the majority of his career. Known for his fine handling of pitchers and outstanding defensive ability, Schalk was considered the greatest defensive catcher of his era. He revolutionized the way the catching position was played by using his speed and agility to expand the previously accepted defensive capabilities for his position. Schalk was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.

==Early life==
Born in Harvel, Illinois to German immigrant parents, Schalk grew up in Litchfield, Illinois. He dropped out of high school to enter the printer&#x27;s trade, learning to operate a linotype machine. When career advancement proved difficult in that trade, and after excelling in local baseball games, he began to play professional baseball.

==Baseball career==
By the age of 18 in 1911, Schalk split time between the Class D Taylorville Christians in the Illinois–Missouri League, where he hit .387, and the Class A Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. In 1912, he posted a .271 batting average in 80 games for Milwaukee and attracted the attention of the Chicago White Sox because of his aggressive approach to the catching position. The White Sox purchased his contract from the Brewers for $10,000 and two other players.

Schalk made his major league debut the day before his twentieth birthday on August 11, 1912. He appeared in 23 games that season, batting .286, but it was his defense behind the plate that impressed the most. White Sox coach Kid Gleason helped him hone his skills, and by the following year Schalk had become the starting catcher in place of Billy Sullivan and led the American League catchers in putouts.

He soon developed a reputation as one of the best defensive catchers in major league baseball. Before Schalk, most catchers were large and slow of foot. Schalk was a small, agile man — he was only tall — who caught with the energy and mobility of a fifth infielder. Due to his small size and youthful appearance, he was often the butt of jokes from opposing players. One time, a policeman refused to let him into the locker room at Comiskey Park, mistaking Schalk for a child.

In 1914, he batted .270 in 136 games and once again led the league in putouts by a catcher. Despite the White Sox&#x27;s sixth-place finish, he ranked sixth in voting for the 1914 American League Most Valuable Player Award. He continued to improve in 1915, batting .266 with a .366 on-base percentage and leading American League catchers in fielding percentage, caught stealing percentage, and putouts as the White Sox rose to third place.

In 1916, Schalk had a career-high 30 stolen bases (a record for a catcher until John Wathan broke it in 1982) and led the league in fielding percentage, putouts, assists, and range factor as the White Sox finished in second place, only two games behind the Boston Red Sox. His pitch-calling skills were evident as he guided the White Sox pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the league.

He batted only .226 in 1917, but his on-base percentage was .331 and he led all American League catchers in putouts for a fifth consecutive year. He once again guided the White Sox pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the league as they won 100 games to win the American League pennant by 9 games over the Boston Red Sox and went on to defeat John McGraw&#x27;s New York Giants in the 1917 World Series four games to two for their last world championship until 2005.

In 1918, he recorded his first putout at second base against the St. Louis Browns. On a hit and run play, the Browns&#x27; Ray Demmitt ran past second base as Shoeless Joe Jackson made a catch in deep left field off the bat of Joe Gedeon. Schalk, in the middle of the diamond, ran to second base to take the relay from White Sox shortstop Swede Risberg and tagged Demmitt out. The White Sox fell to sixth place in the 1918 season, however, as Schalk batted only .219.

They rebounded in 1919 to recapture the American League pennant, with Schalk hitting a career-high .282 and leading the league in putouts for a seventh consecutive season. The 1919 World Series, which the White Sox lost to the Cincinnati Reds, was shrouded in a controversy which became known as the Black Sox Scandal. Several White Sox players were accused of intentionally throwing games. This was in sharp contrast to Schalk; it is said that Schalk&#x27;s reputation as an honest and honorable man led the gamblers not even to consider approaching him. Schalk played to win, hitting for a Series .304 batting average and was later officially absolved from any wrongdoing. He told investigators he knew something was wrong when pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams did not throw the pitches he had called for. The White Sox lost the series five games to three, and eight of their players were banned for life from major league baseball as complicit in the scandal, though not Schalk. Years later, Schalk said that the conspirators caught a break when one of the &quot;Clean Sox,&quot; pitcher Red Faber, was forced to sit out the Series with the flu. Schalk believed that had Faber been available, there would have never been a fix since Faber would have likely gotten starts that went to Cicotte and Williams.

He had another good year in 1920, hitting .270 with a .362 on-base percentage and a career-high 61 runs batted in. He led the American League for an eighth consecutive year in putouts as the White Sox finished in second place. The 1922 season was one of his finest. On April 30, 1922, he caught Charlie Robertson&#x27;s perfect game against the Detroit Tigers, the last perfect game in the major leagues until Don Larsen&#x27;s in the 1956 World Series. Two months later, on June 27, he hit for the cycle. He ended the season with a .281 average, hit 4 home runs and drove in 60 runs. He led the league in putouts, and tied the American League record for fielding percentage for a catcher at .989. He finished third in voting for the 1922 American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award.

By 1924, the wear and tear of catching began to catch up with him. He had played in 100 games or more in 11 consecutive seasons, but injured three fingers on his throwing hand which limited him to 57 games and a career-low .197 batting average in 1924. He rebounded in 1925 to play in 125 games, bat .274 with a career-high .382 on-base percentage, and lead the league in baserunners caught stealing. In November 1926, he succeeded Eddie Collins as the White Sox player-manager at the age of 33. His playing time diminished in 1927, as he appeared in only 16 games while concentrating on managing the team. Over the two seasons he played and managed, he won 102 and lost 125 for a .449 won-lost percentage. He then had a salary disagreement with team owner Charles Comiskey, and left the White Sox to become a player-coach with the New York Giants in 1929, but appeared in only five games before retiring as a player at the age of 36.

==Managerial record==
==Career statistics and legacy==

In an 18-year major league career, Schalk played in 1,762 games, accumulating 1,345 hits in 5,306 at bats for a .253 career batting average along with 11 home runs, 594 runs batted in, 579 runs, 177 stolen bases, an on-base percentage of .340 and a .981 fielding percentage. He established himself as one of the American League&#x27;s outstanding defensive catchers by leading AL catchers in fielding percentage eight times, putouts nine times, double plays four times and assists twice. He set major league catching records for putouts, and still holds the major league career record for double plays (217) and the American League career mark for assists. No catcher has approached Schalk&#x27;s record for career double plays, and none has led the league in fielding percentage eight times. He held the record for most no-hitters caught (four), until a rules change in the early 1990s disallowed one of them. Schalk&#x27;s 51.32% career caught stealing percentage ranks eighth all-time among major league catchers. He caught 144 shutouts in his career, ranking third all-time among catchers behind Yogi Berra and Carlton Fisk.

He set standards for longevity for catchers, catching 100 or more games for 11 straight seasons. His major league record of 1,726 games caught stood until 1945 when it was broken by Rick Ferrell. He also established himself as one of the finest baserunning catchers, setting a single-season stolen base record for the position in 1916 with 30, which stood until John Wathan stole 36 bases in 1982.

Schalk helped revolutionize the way the catcher&#x27;s position was played. He is credited with being the first catcher to back up infield throws to first base and outfield throws to third base. He claimed to be the only major league catcher to have made a putout at every base, and once made three assists in one inning. He also became known for his handling of the White Sox pitching staff and his pitch-calling skills. His reputation as a defensive standout is enhanced due to the era in which he played: in the deadball era, catchers played a much greater defensive role than subsequently, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs. He had to catch every type of pitch imaginable, including shine balls, spitballs, knuckleballs and emory balls from pitchers such as, Ed Walsh, Eddie Cicotte, Dickie Kerr, Urban Faber and Ted Lyons.

Schalk&#x27;s career batting average of .253 is the lowest of any position player in the Hall of Fame. That he was selected by the Veterans Committee for enshrinement in is largely a tribute to his outstanding defensive skills and to the fact that he played to win the infamous 1919 World Series for the White Sox.

Schalk and pitcher Red Faber started 306 games as a battery, fourth-most of any such duo since 1900.

==Post-playing career==
Schalk became a coach for the Chicago Cubs in 1930 and 1931, and later managed the Buffalo Bisons in the Double-A International League from to . He also managed the Indianapolis Indians, the Oklahoma City Indians and the Milwaukee Brewers minor league teams. In , he became a scout for the Chicago Cubs. He was an assistant baseball coach at Purdue University for 18 seasons, on the staff of luminaries such as Ward Lambert and Hank Stram. He retired from baseball at 72.

After his retirement as an active player for the MLB, Schalk invested in a successful bowling alley located in Evergreen Park, Illinois. He named the business &quot;Schalk&#x27;s Evergreen Towers&quot;. In 1948, Schalk, his wife Lavinia, and 34 others were taken down to the basement, locked inside various rooms, and held hostage inside the bowling alley by 6 armed robbers. After 2 hours of confinement and people passing out from lack of air inside the rooms, several pin-boys were able to knock a door down and free everyone. The robbers were never caught.

In 1955, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee.
He was invited to catch the first ball of the 1959 World Series–the White Sox&#x27; first appearance in the World Series in 40 years–thrown out by fellow Hall of Fame member and former White Sox pitcher Red Faber.

A museum in Nokomis, Illinois, is dedicated to Schalk and two other Hall of Famers, Jim Bottomley and Red Ruffing. The Little League ball fields in Litchfield, Illinois, near his birthplace of Harvel, are named for him. He died of cancer on May 19, 1970, at the age of 78, and is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Evergreen Park, Illinois.

==In popular culture==
Schalk was portrayed by Gordon Clapp in the 1988 film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;.

<doc id="819847" wikidata="Q10858068" url="?curid=819847" title="Production line">
<text>A production line is a set of sequential operations established in a factory where components are assembled to make a finished article or where materials are put through a refining process to produce an end-product that is suitable for onward consumption.

Typically, raw materials such as metal ores or agricultural products such as foodstuffs or textile source plants like cotton and flax require a sequence of treatments to render them useful. For metal, the processes include crushing, smelting and further refining. For plants, the useful material has to be separated from husks or contaminants and then treated for onward sale.

==History==
Early production processes were constrained by the availability of a source of energy, with wind mills and water mills providing power for the crude heavy processes and manpower being used for activities requiring more precision. In earlier centuries, with raw materials, power and people often being in different locations, production was distributed across a number of sites. The concentration of numbers of people in manufactories, and later the factory as exemplified by the cotton mills of Richard Arkwright, started the move towards co-locating individual processes.

===Introduction of the steam engine===
With the development of the steam engine in the latter half of the 18th century, the production elements became less reliant on the location of the power source, and so the processing of goods moved to either the source of the materials or the location of people to perform the tasks. Separate processes for different treatment stages were brought into the same building, and the various stages of refining or manufacture were combined.

===Industrial Revolution===
With increasing use of steam power, and increasing use of machinery to supplant the use of people, the integrated use of techniques in production lines spurred the Industrial Revolutions of Europe and North America.

==Assembly line==

Thus, from the processing of raw materials into useful goods, the next step was the concept of the assembly line, as introduced by Eli Whitney. This was taken to the next stage at the Ford Motor Company in 1913, where Henry Ford introduced the innovation of continuously moving the cars being assembled past individual workstations. This introduced the idea of standardization.

The assembly line was a contraption of many chains and links that moved to place different parts into various places throughout the car. The chassis of the car was moved along the 45-metre line by a chain conveyor and then 140 workers applied their assigned parts to the chassis. Other workers brought additional parts to the car builders to keep them stocked. The assembly line decreased the assembly time per vehicle. The production time for a single car dropped from over twelve hours to just 93 minutes.

<doc id="819850" wikidata="Q17017070" url="?curid=819850" title="Ngiṉṯaka">
<text>Ngiṉṯaka (), also spelled Ngintaku, is a mythological giant perentie lizard from Aṉangu and Pitjantjatjara Aboriginal religion. It is associated with Angatja, an area along an important songline.

Ngiṉṯaka is one of the two major reptile Ancestral Beings associated with Uluru, the other being Milpali.

== Myth ==
Ngiṉṯaka&#x27;s songline, known as &quot;Inma Ngiṉṯaka&quot;, tells of his journey of creation over 500 km. The song’s stanzas follow his travels through the land, where he is portrayed with human characteristics.

In the myth, Ngiṉṯaka travels from his home near the Western Australia border to the camp of another lizard tribe, near Oodnadatta, in search of a better grindstone. He steals the Anangu grindstone and carries it home while being chased by the Anangu people. Along his journey, he digs up tjanmatjas (bush onions), creating large boulders. As he travels, he creates many landforms in the Musgrave and Mann Ranges and vomits up various grass seeds and vegetable foods. It is colored black and white as a form of camouflage to hide from predators.

== Geography ==
According to mythology, Ngarutjaranya, the highest mountain in South Australia, is also Ngiṉṯaka as he rears up to look over the country. He is returning to his home in the west.

<doc id="819895" wikidata="Q3982492" url="?curid=819895" title="Technopaganism">
<text>Technopaganism, as described by Victoria Dos Santos, is &quot;a term encompassing a variety of practices and expressions related to contemporary paganism, popular culture, and spiritual pursuits in digital environments.&quot; The Internet, for instance, is considered by some technopagans to have spiritual significance or unique magical applications. 

==Definition==
Technopaganism is concerned with spiritual and magical aspects of technology and, sometimes, the interconnections between technology and society. Dos Santos classified technopaganism into two types: the first pertains to the adaptation of various neopagan currents to online environments (e.g., via virtual communities or collaborative software), while the second comprises a body of neopagan beliefs and practices greatly influenced by information and communications technology and &quot;deeply merged with cybernetic culture&quot;.

A notable instance of technopagan adaptation of neopagan practices is the creation and distribution of virtual Books of Shadows and sacred texts through the Internet; similarly, virtual world platforms such as &quot;Second Life&quot; and &quot;VRChat&quot; are used to connect with others and conduct rituals.

== Beliefs ==
A common element of technopaganism is the adaptation of neopagan beliefs, such as animism, to technology and cyberspace. Dos Santos writes that a fundamental aspect of technopagan animism is &quot;a dialogic relationship with the digital environment itself.&quot;

In a 1995 Wired article, technopagan Mark Pesce describes how, upon first using NCSA Mosaic, he realized that the World Wide Web was the first emergent property of the Internet: &quot;It&#x27;s displaying all the requisite qualitiesit came on very suddenly, it happened everywhere simultaneously, and it&#x27;s self-organizing. I call that the Web eating the Net.&quot; He went on to create VRML, with one of his motivations having been to bring about a spatial dimension of the Web.

==In popular culture==
In the TV series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, the major character Jenny Calendar is a technopagan.

&quot;American Gods&quot; by Neil Gaiman marries traditional ideas of gods with the concept of egregores, which influence the results of progress and new technology in society and lead to the creation of the &quot;New Gods&quot;.

<text>The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB; ) or Seda va Sima () for short, formerly called National Iranian Radio and Television until the Iranian revolution of 1979, is an Iranian state-controlled media corporation that holds a monopoly of domestic radio and television services in Iran. It is also among the largest media organizations in Asia and the Pacific region and a regular member of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. Its head is appointed directly by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

With 13,000 employees and branches in 20 countries worldwide, including France, Belgium, Guyana, Malaysia, Lebanon, United Kingdom, the United States, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting offers both domestic and foreign radio and television services, broadcasting twelve domestic television channels, four international news television channels, six satellite television channels for international audiences, and thirty provincial television channels available countrywide, half of which are broadcast in minority-status languages in Iran, such as Azerbaijani and Kurdish, as well as the local dialects of Persian. IRIB provides twelve radio stations for domestic audiences, and through the IRIB World Service, thirty radio stations are available for foreign and international audiences. It also publishes the Persian-language newspaper &quot;Jam-e Jam&quot;.

== History ==
=== Before the 1979 revolution ===
On 24 April 1940, Radio Iran was officially opened by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – the then crown prince of Iran – with Isa Sedigh as the first head of the company. The channel broadcast five hour programs including news, traditional and western music, religious and sports programming as well as programs dedicated to economic and political discussion. according to estimates from the Statistical Center of Iran, in 1976 about 76% of urban population and 45% of rural population had access to the radio.

National Iranian Television officially opened on 21 March 1967 to create National Iranian Radio and Television. At that time, hardware equipment was at the disposal of the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone and its media was producing by Advertising and publishing department. In later years, radio and television expansion request across the country to create an integrated entity and from 1971 all facilities was given to National Radio and Television. The Shah personally appointed Reza Ghotbi as head of organization and the duration of the programs increased quickly. At the end of revolution two TV channels (first program and second program) was active and with facilities expansion, more than 95% of Urban population and about 75% of country population was able to receive TV waves. Before the revolution about 40% of TV programs was foreign and also imported and internal programs were usually modelled from foreign programs.

During the revolution, when Arteshbod Azhari became prime minister of Iran, Touraj Farazmand was chosen for head of National Iranian Radio and Television after Reza Ghotbi.

=== After the 1979 revolution ===
The organization expanded greatly after 1979 revolution, and in addition to internal and global broadcasting channels, it manages more than one hundred electronic and written media.

A broadcasting budget of 4000 billion Tomans was expected in the 2018 budget bill, however, according to Ali Asgari (the organization manager), a channel budget like that of BBC Persian consists of over 6000 billion Tomans and IRIB needs a larger budget for managing 62 TV channels and 83 radio channels.

=== Broadcasting sign ===
The IRIB sign includes the Emblem of the Islamic Republic at the top and two characters &quot;لا&quot;. When this sign was conceived at the beginning of the revolution, it represented the revolution&#x27;s slogan of &quot;neither Eastern, nor Western – Islamic Republic&quot; and thus symbolized denial of both capitalist and communist influence or specifically the United States and Soviet Union. These two words at the middle get together like a channel and there is an eye sign at the intersection of them (which was later adapted into the logo of the flagship television channel). At the bottom of the sign, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting phrase is written in Nastaliq font in the Persian language.

== Organisational structure ==
According to Article 175 of the Iranian constitution,
# The freedom of expression and dissemination of thoughts in the Radio and Television of the Islamic Republic of Iran must be guaranteed in keeping with the Islamic criteria and the best interests of the country.
# The appointment and dismissal of the head of the Radio and Television of the Islamic Republic of Iran rest with the Leader. A council consisting of two representatives each of the President, the head of the judiciary branch, and the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Iranian parliament shall supervise the functioning of this organization.
# The policies and the manner of managing the organization and its supervision will be determined by law.

== Heads ==
The director-general of IRIB is Peyman Jebelli, who was appointed by the Supreme Leader of Iran in 2021.

== Controversies ==
The isolation of Iran’s movie industry has forced filmmakers to reorient themselves around national television broadcasters. These networks churn out ideological products in line with the state’s Islamic gender norms, with women sometimes cast in traditional roles and deferential to men, who are portrayed as their guardians and protectors. Amid the intensified conflict with the United States, Iran’s security establishment has emerged as a major producer of blockbuster television and film centering on the prowess of the Revolutionary Guards and its intelligence services. Iran is awash in sophisticated domestic versions of “Homeland,” and lacks the self-interrogating, subversive cinema that allows a society to have a public conversation with itself about gender, culture, marriage and power.

=== Allegations of false confessions ===
A study published in June 2020 by the Justice for Iran and the International Federation for Human Rights claimed that Iranian television had broadcast the potentially coerced confessions of 355 detainees since 2010. Former prisoners stated they had been beaten and received threats of sexual violence as a means for their false testimonies to be delivered for use by the country&#x27;s broadcasters.

=== Censorship of reformists ===
IRIB, along with other Iranian state-run media, tend to censor or silence voices or opinions of reformist politicians as well ridicule them even as the reformists are in power since IRIB&#x27;s editorial bias is more closer to the Supreme Leader and the Principlist.

===April 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel===
In April 2024, Iranian state television under the guise of supposed destruction in Israel due to an attack by Iranian missiles and drones, actually showed footage of a fire in Chile, filmed several months ago.

== International sanctions ==

=== United States ===
Pursuant to the United States Presidential Executive Order 13628, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting is subjected to U.S. sanctions under Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act which gives the Treasury Department the authority to designate those in Iran who restrict or deny the free flow of information to or from the Iranian people.

=== European Union ===
IRIB was placed in the list of sanctioned entities of the European Union in December 2022 due to its role in the repression of the Mahsa Amini protests. Following this order, Eutelsat ceased broadcasts of the IRIB international channels for the Europe region via Hot Bird satellite on 21 December 2022.

<text>Dover Air Force Base or Dover AFB is a United States Air Force (USAF) base under the operational control of Air Mobility Command (AMC), located southeast of the city of Dover, Delaware. The 436th Airlift Wing is the host wing, and runs the busiest and largest air freight terminal in the Department of Defense.

==History==
===20th century===
Construction of Municipal Airport, Dover Airdrome began in March 1941 and the facility was opened on December 17, 1941. It was converted to a U.S. Army Air Corps airfield just weeks after the December 7, 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor. It was renamed Dover Army Airbase on April 8, 1943; *Dover Subbase on June 6, 1943, and Dover Army Airfield on February 2, 1944. With the establishment of the United States Air Force (USAF) on September 18, 1947, the facility was renamed Dover Air Force Base on January 13, 1948.

====World War II====
In March 1941, Dover Air Force Base was founded during World War II to meet the need of the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) for an airfield that could be used as a training center. USAAC obtained jurisdiction over the municipal airport at Dover, Delaware.

Once the airport came under military control, an immediate construction program began to turn the civil airport into a military facility. Construction involved runways and airplane hangars, with three concrete runways, several taxiways, a large parking apron and a control tower. Several large hangars were also constructed. Buildings were ultimately utilitarian and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not intended for long-term use, were constructed with temporary or semi-permanent materials. Although some hangars had steel frames, and the occasional brick or tile brick building could be seen, most support buildings sat on concrete foundations, but were of frame construction, and clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper. Initially under USAAC, the name of the facility was Municipal Airport, Dover Airdrome and the airfield opened on 17 December 1941. The airfield was assigned to the First Air Force.

On 20 December the first military unit arrived at Dover&#x27;s new airfield: the 112th Observation Squadron of the Ohio National Guard which flew anti-submarine patrols off the Delaware Coast. In early 1942, three B-25 Mitchell bomber squadrons arrived with the 45th Bombardment Group from I Bomber Command, later part of Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command, assumed the anti-submarine mission.

On 8 April 1943, the name of the airfield was changed to Dover Army Air Base. The antisubmarine mission ended on 6 June, and construction crews moved back to the base for a major upgrading project that lengthened the main runway to 7,000 feet. During the construction period and continuing into June 1944, Dover AAB became a sub-base of Camp Springs Army Airfield, Maryland.

Full operational capability was restored to Dover in September, and seven P-47 Thunderbolt squadrons arrived for training in preparation for eventual involvement in the European Theater, while the 83d Fighter Group was assigned to Dover as the Operational Training Unit, The 83rd was redesignated the 125th Base Unit on 10 April 1944, with very little change in its mission. It was further redesignated as the 125th Army Air Force base Unit on 15 September 1944.

In 1944, the Air Technical Service Command chose Dover as a site to engineer, develop, and conduct classified air-launched rocket tests. The information collected during these experiments resulted in the effective deployment of air-to-surface rockets in both the European and Pacific combat theaters.

On 1 September 1946, as a result of the drawdown of United States forces after the war, Dover Army Airfield was placed on temporary inactive status. A small housekeeping unit, the 4404th Base Standby Squadron, remained on the airfield for care and maintenance of the facility.

====Cold War and Vietnam====
Dover Airfield was reactivated on 1 August 1950 as a result of the Korean War and the expansion of the USAF in response to the Soviet threat in the Cold War. On February 1, 1951, the 148th Fighter Interceptor Squadron of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard arrived with P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft. During the 1950s problems developed with many of the facilities in Dover, which had been hastily constructed to support its World War II mission. As a result, a massive engineering project was undertaken to modernize the base.

On April 1, 1952, Dover was transferred to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) and became home to 1607th Air Transport Wing (Heavy). A full function hospital was completed in 1958 and base housing was expanded to handle 1,200 families in 1961. On January 1, 1966, the Military Air Transport Service was redesignated the Military Airlift Command (MAC). Along with the reorganization, the 1607th was discontinued and the 436th Military Airlift Wing (436 MAW) activated and assumed the mission at Dover. The 436 MAW started replacing C-141 Starlifters and C-133 Cargomasters with the new C-5 Galaxy in 1971. Two years later Dover became the first all C-5 equipped wing in the USAF, trading the last of its C-141 to Charleston AFB, South Carolina.

During the Vietnam War, the bodies of more than 20,000 American soldiers were brought back to the United States via Dover. The Vietnam War dead account for over 90% of all the remains processed at Dover before 1988.

When the Yom Kippur War broke out between Israel and the combined forces of Egypt and Syria on October 13, 1973, the 436 MAW responded with a 32-day airlift that delivered 22,305 tons of munitions and military equipment to Israel. The 436 MAW also assisted in the evacuation of Americans from Iran on December 9, 1978, following the Islamic Revolution. That year, Dover AFB was also used to store hundreds of bodies from the mass murder and suicide of the Jonestown community in Guyana.

Some of the more memorable flights during the post-war period included the airdrop and test firing of a Minuteman I intercontinental ballistic missile and the delivery of a 40-ton superconducting magnet to Moscow during the Cold War, for which the crew received the Mackay Trophy.

After the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, the remains of the seven astronauts were transferred to Dover AFB. It is one of only seven airports in the country that served as launch abort facilities for the Space Shuttle.

In March 1989, C-5s from Dover delivered special equipment used to clean up the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska. On June 7, 1989, while attending the Airlift Rodeo, a 436 MAW C-5 set a world record when it airdropped 190,346 pounds and 73 paratroopers. In October 1983, the wing flew 24 missions in support of Operation Urgent Fury, the Grenada rescue operation and later flew 16 missions to support Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama, in December 1989 – January 1990.

During Desert Shield, the wing flew approximately 17,000 flying hours and airlifted a total of 131,275 tons of cargo in support of combat operations after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

In 1992, with the disestablishment of Military Airlift Command, Dover AFB was transferred to the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC) and the 436 MAW and 512 MAW (Associate) were redesignated as the 436th Airlift Wing (436 AW) and the 512th Airlift Wing (512 AW), respectively. Dover also served as a major port of entry and exit for the conflicts in the Balkans and Somalia during the latter half of the 1990s.

===21st century===
====September 11 attacks====
Following the September 11 attacks, the 436 AW and 512 AW became major participants in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. An aircrew from Dover&#x27;s 3rd Airlift Squadron landed the first C-5 in Iraq in late 2003 when they landed at Baghdad International Airport and the two wings continue to support operations in the region.

Also following September 11, 2001, U.S. Army mortuary specialists organized support for Pentagon recovery efforts out of the base. This effort evolved into the Joint Personal Effects Depot, which supports recovery and redistribution of the personal effects of wounded and killed personnel from all arms of the military. In 2003, the Depot was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Dover AFB is also where service members from all six branches of service killed in combat are repatriated. Their remains are processed, inspected for unexploded ordnance, cleaned, and prepared for burial before being escorted to the point of interment decided by the family. The Depot returned to Dover in 2011, when in April a new $14 million custom-built facility officially opened.

On April 3, 2006, a C-5 Galaxy crashed short of a runway, skidding into a farm field. There were no fatalities.

By 2008, the air traffic tower serving the airfield, built in 1955, was the oldest such tower in use in the USAF. In 2009 the base received a new 128-foot tall tower, overlapping the original 103-foot one which was donated to the Air Mobility Command Museum, accessible to visitors.

Dover AFB is the first air force base to receive the new C-5M &quot;Super Galaxy&quot;, receiving the aircraft on February 9, 2009 (named &quot;The Spirit of Global Reach&quot;).

On February 2, 2015, the 9,600 foot runway 01-19 was closed for repairs. The runway was re-opened for operation on September 23, 2016. During the repair, the 12,900 foot runway 14–32 was temporarily cut in half so that the intersection of the two runways could be repaired. C-17 Globemasters could land on either half of runway 14–32.

== Facilities and aircraft ==

The airport has two runways. Runway 14/32 measures 12903 x 150 ft (3933 x 46 m) and is paved with asphalt and concrete. Runway 1/19 measures 9602 x 150 ft (2927 x 46 m) and is paved with concrete. The airport averages 123,735 aircraft operations per year, an average of 339 per day. It is entirely military aviation.

==Airlines and destinations==

== Role and operations ==

Dover AFB is home to the 436th Airlift Wing (436 AW) of the Air Mobility Command (AMC), known as the &quot;Eagle Wing&quot;, and the AMC-gained 512th Airlift Wing (512 AW) of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), referred to as the &quot;Liberty Wing&quot;. It was previously the only base to solely operate the massive C-5 Galaxy and now operates both that aircraft plus the C-17 Globemaster III. The 436 AW has two active flying squadrons (the 3rd Airlift Squadron, which now operates the C-17, and 9th Airlift Squadron), and the 512 AW has two AFRC flying squadrons (the 326th Airlift Squadron and the 709th Airlift Squadron).

Dover AFB is also the home for the largest military mortuary in the Department of Defense, and has been used for processing military personnel killed in both war and peacetime; the remains of those killed overseas are traditionally brought to Dover AFB before being transferred to family. The Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs has also been used to identify remains of civilians in certain exceptional circumstances: in 1978 for the victims of the Jonestown mass murder/suicide, in 1986 for identifying the remains of the crew of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, and in 2003 for the crew of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. It was also a major site for identifying the remains of military personnel killed in the 9/11 attacks. During the night of October 28, 2009, before making a decision on the committal of further troops to Afghanistan, President Barack Obama visited the base to receive the bodies of several American soldiers killed in Afghanistan.

Two sections of the 436th Aerial Port Squadron warehouse collapsed on February 18, 2003, as a result of a record snow storm. No one was injured in the collapse that caused more than an estimated $1 million in damages. The damage covered two of the six cargo processing bays in the facility.

Dover Air Force Base is also home to the Air Mobility Command Museum.

===Air Show===
Dover Air Force Base holds an annual air show, with the most recent occurring in May 2022. The show includes static displays of military aircraft and equipment, and flight demonstrations of the United States Air Force Thunderbirds or United States Navy Blue Angels demonstration teams.

==Geography==
A section of the base is treated as a census-designated place named &quot;Dover Base Housing.&quot; It is part of the Dover metropolitan area. Dover Base Housing had a population of 3,450 at the 2010 census. According to the United States Census Bureau, Dover Base Housing has a total area of 0.7 square miles (1.7 km2), all land.

Other portions of the base are in the city limits of Dover.

Dover Base Housing consists of a development called Eagle Heights Family Housing, which is made up of 980 homes in single-family, duplex, triplex, and fourplex configurations. The development features a community center, multiple neighborhood centers, picnic areas, fitness center, and golf course. Eagle Heights Family Housing contains a total of of greenbelt paths for walking, jogging, and biking. Students in the development attend public schools in the Caesar Rodney School District.

Since 1997, the base has been served by three highway exits with Delaware Route 1, allowing quick access to Dover and to southern Delaware from the complex. Dover AFB provides almost $470 million a year in revenue to the city of Dover, making it the third largest industry in Delaware.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 3,394 people, 1,032 households, and 1,017 families residing in the base. The population density was 5,061.6 people per square mile (1,955.9/km2). There were 1,245 housing units at an average density of 1,856.7 per square mile (717.5/km2). The racial makeup of the base was 72.57% White, 16.59% African American, 0.77% Native American, 1.86% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, 2.80% from other races, and 5.30% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.75% of the population.

There were 6,032 households, out of which 76.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 90.2% were married couples living together, 5.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 1.4% were non-families. 1.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 0.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.29 and the average family size was 3.30.

In the base the population was spread out, with 40.2% under the age of 18, 16.5% from 18 to 24, 41.5% from 25 to 44, 1.7% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 23 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.5 males.

The median income for a household in the base was $34,318, and the median income for a family was $34,659. Males had a median income of $26,322 versus $20,444 for females. The per capita income for the base was $12,119. About 5.2% of families and 4.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.5% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Air Mobility Command Museum==
Hangar 1301 at Dover Air Force Base is home to the Air Mobility Command Museum. The museum is dedicated to military airlift and air refueling aircraft and the people who maintain them. It has a large collection of fully restored cargo and tanker aircraft. Tours are conducted during the day by volunteers, many of whom are retired pilots, navigators, flight engineers and loadmasters who provide first-person narratives of actual events. The hangar encloses over of aircraft display gallery plus of exhibit rooms. An attached building houses a theater, museum store, exhibit workshop, and various offices. A aircraft parking area allows close-up inspection of the outside aircraft. The museum also maintains archives related to the history of the Air Mobility Command and Dover AFB. Building 1301, Dover Air Force Base was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

There are 33 airframes in the collection in 2015, and a staff of more than 170 volunteers. A single battered Douglas C-47A Skytrain, salvaged in 1986 off of a dump at Olmsted Air Force Base, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, after being used for target practice, was the museum&#x27;s modest beginning. Airlifted to Dover AFB by a Pennsylvania National Guard helicopter, &quot;It was the first aircraft restored for the newly conceptualized museum that would form here.&quot;

Founded as the Dover AFB Historical Center on 13 October 1986, it originally was housed in three hangars within the main area of the base. It was officially recognized with museum status in 1995 and moved to its current location in 1996. On 5 February 1997, Air Mobility Command officially named the Dover AFB Museum as the AMC Museum.

==Education==
The Dover Base Housing is located in the Caesar Rodney School District. It is assigned to the Dover Air Base schools for grades K-8: Major George S. Welch Elementary School and Dover Air Force Base Middle School. Caesar Rodney High School in Camden is the comprehensive high school for the entire district.

Wilmington University has a center on Dover AFB.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* On January 13, 2013, a Piper PA-28 was substantially damaged during a forced landing following a total loss of engine power while on approach to Dover Air Force Base. The aircraft was flying an instrument approach into the airport while on an instrument flight plan bound for the Summit Airport in Middletown. The aircraft was completely fueled before the accident flight. During flight, the pilot was advised that previous traffic had been unable to land at the Summit Airport due to weather, and the accident pilot requested an approach into Salisbury Regional Airport in Maryland, which ultimately didn&#x27;t work out. The pilot subsequently tried to land at the Sussex County Airport, then expressed interest in landing at the Delaware Airpark in Dover. The pilot requested to land at Dover Air Force Base but was subsequently told he only could in an emergency. The pilot eventually declared a fuel emergency and tried an instrument approach into DOV, but the aircraft crashed before landing. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot&#x27;s failure to land the airplane at multiple airports that were equipped with adequate instrument approach procedures while operating in low instrument meteorological conditions and his delay in declaring a fuel-related emergency, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.

<text>Fra Mauro, O.S.B. Cam., (c.1400–1464) was an Italian (Venetian) cartographer who lived in the Republic of Venice. He created the most detailed and accurate map of the world up until that time, the Fra Mauro map.

Mauro was a monk of the Camaldolese Monastery of St. Michael, located on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon. It was there that he maintained a cartography workshop. He also was employed by some very powerful men like Prince Henry the Navigator.

== Biography ==
Fra Mauro was born before or around the year 1400. In his youth, Mauro had traveled extensively as a merchant and a soldier. He was familiar with the Middle East. He is recorded in the records of the Monastery of St. Michael from 1409. As a lay member of the monastery, Mauro was employed as mapmaker. In the records of the monastery his main job was recorded as collecting the monastery&#x27;s rents, but from the 1450s he is also mentioned as the creator of a series of world maps. Although he was no longer free to travel, due to his religious status, he would frequently consult with merchants of the city upon their return from overseas voyages. By 1450 he composed a great &quot;mappa mundi&quot; – a world map – with surprising accuracy, including extensive written comments reflecting the geographic knowledge of his time. The map is known today as the &quot;Fra Mauro map&quot;.

==The Fra Mauro world map==
The Fra Mauro world map, or mappa mundi, was a major cartographical work that compiled much of the geographical knowledge of the time. The map covers over five square meters. The map is extremely detailed and contains many thousands of texts and illustrations. The world map took several years to complete and was the most detailed and accurate world map that had been produced up until that time.

Fra Mauro created the map under a commission by King Afonso V of Portugal. Andrea Bianco, a sailor-cartographer, is recorded as having collaborated with Fra Mauro in creating the map, as payments made to him between 1448 and 1459 testify. The map was completed on 24 April 1459, and sent to Portugal, but that copy did not survive. Along with the map was a letter from the Doge of Venice. It was intended for Prince Henry the Navigator, Afonso V&#x27;s uncle. It encouraged the prince to continue funding exploratory journeys. Fra Mauro died the following year, while he was making a copy of the map for the Signoria of Venice. The copy was completed by Andrea Bianco. A commemorative medal of the period struck in honor of his cartographic work describes Fra Mauro as &quot;chosmographus incomparabilis&quot;.

==Other work==
Two copies of maps by Fra Mauro are known to survive. One is a portolan chart in the Vatican Library, (Codice Borgiano V) published by Roberto Almagià in 1944. The other was recognized by Antonio Ratti as a copy signed by Giorgio Callapoda at Candia and dated 1541, of a lost chart by Fra Mauro, sold at auction in Milan in 1984 and now in a private collection, probably in France.

==Tributes==
The crater Fra Mauro and associated Fra Mauro formation of the Moon are named after him. The Apollo 13 lunar mission was intended to explore the Fra Mauro formation, but – due to the explosion aboard the spacecraft – Apollo 13&#x27;s crew had to return to Earth without landing on the Moon. The formation was instead explored by astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell of the Apollo 14 mission in February 1971.

<doc id="820001" wikidata="Q2916895" url="?curid=820001" title="Glorieta Pass">
<text>Glorieta Pass (elevation 7500 ft.) is a mountain pass in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern New Mexico. The pass is at a strategic location near at the southern end of the Sangre de Cristos in east central Santa Fe County southeast of the city of Santa Fe.

Historically, the pass provided the most direct route through the mountains between the upper valley of the Pecos River to the east and the upper valley of the Rio Grande to the west. 
In the 19th century, it furnished the route of the westernmost leg of the Santa Fe Trail between Santa Fe and the High Plains.

The Battle of Glorieta Pass, the decisive battle of the New Mexico Campaign of the American Civil War, was fought near the pass in March 1862. The victory by the Union Army (primarily in the form of the Colorado Militia) prevented the breakout of the Confederate Army forces onto the High Plains on the east side of Sangre de Cristo Mountains, halting the intended Confederate advance northward along the base of the Rocky Mountains. The battle is commemorated at Pecos National Historic Park on the east side of the pass. In the 20th century, the pass became used as the route of U.S. Highway 84 and later Interstate 25. The town of Glorieta is located on the eastern side of the pass.

The stairwells of the Colorado State Capitol Building display cannonballs from the battle as ornaments.

In 1879, the New Mexico and Southern Pacific Railroad constructed a railroad through the pass, which became part of the second North American transcontinental railroad in March 1881. The NM&amp;SP was absorbed into its parent company, the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad in 1899, and the Santa Fe used the route for their Chicago to Los Angeles trains, including the famed &quot;El Capitan&quot; and &quot;Super Chief&quot;. Now part of the BNSF system, this remains the route of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;, with one passenger train each direction daily, but little freight. It was one of the last places where semaphore signals were still in use on an active mainline anywhere in North America. They were retired and replaced with modern signals in November 2022.

<doc id="820012" wikidata="Q7914401" url="?curid=820012" title="Vandenberg resolution">
<text>The Vandenberg Resolution () was passed in June 1948 and was proposed by and named after US Senator Arthur Vandenberg.

Negotiations over the nature and degree of commitment by the United States to defend its North Atlantic allies were complicated by the conflicting desire of the allies for an iron-clad assurance of immediate US intervention in case of a Soviet attack and the insistence for the US Senate that its constitutional prerogatives to be preserved, especially the power to commit the US to war. US State Department officials, after assuming a common position of support for the idea of a treaty, patiently wove together a text that balanced the concerns of its European allies, the Senate, and the US military. Domestic US politics, particularly those arising from the presidential election of 1948, played an important role in the international and congressional negotiations.

In keeping with practices worked out during the congressional debate over the Marshall Plan, discussions between administration and Republican leaders over collective security arrangements in Europe were held between April and June 1948. The talks reflected the likelihood of a Republican (GOP) presidential victory in the November elections. Republican Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and President pro tempore of the Senate, was a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination before he dropped out of the contest. In friendly and candid talks with Secretary of State George Marshall and Under-Secretary Robert A. Lovett, Vandenberg embraced the concept of a North Atlantic alliance and agreed to support it in the Senate only if substantive negotiations were delayed until after the elections, and the UN Charter was more clearly affirmed and invoked in the prospective treaty.

The role of personal relations in foreign policy was demonstrated by Lovett&#x27;s informal discussions with Vandenberg, who was now a convinced internationalist and wanted to be helpful but was mindful of political realities, which he sought to impress on the Lovett and the Truman administration.

In an April 11 meeting, Lovett tactfully probed Vandenberg&#x27;s thinking on a number of key issues, including the type of aid Congress would approve; the form of a pact, particularly the willingness of the Senate to approve a slightly modified version of the Rio Treaty with regard to Europe; the role of the United Nations in collective security arrangements; and the legislative preparation needed for eventual conclusion of a long-term European security agreement. A week later, Vandenberg and Lovett discussed the wording of a resolution that would provide the legislative groundwork for a long-term pact.

On May 11, Vandenberg presented a resolution that he had drafted with Lovett to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which approved it. On June 11 Vandenberg introduced and the Senate passed 82-13 a resolution advising the President to seek the security of the US and the rest of the Free World by support of mutual defense arrangements that operated within the UN Charter but outside the UN Security Council since the Soviet veto would otherwise thwart collective defense arrangements.

Paragraph 3 of the resolution referred to issues of military assistance or alliance by encouraging &quot;association by the United States, by constitutional process, with such regional and other collective arrangements as are based on continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, and as effects its national security.&quot;

The Vandenberg Resolution was the landmark action that opened the way to the negotiation of the North Atlantic Treaty. It is clear that the concept of such an alliance first arose during the Pentagon Talks in Washington in March, but US action would have been stymied without the Senate resolution endorsing an internationalist role for the country.

As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Vandenberg asserted that &quot;politics stops at the water&#x27;s edge&quot; and cooperated with the Truman administration in forging bipartisan support. Francis O. Wilcox, the first chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, recalled that Vandenberg&#x27;s Senate career stood as a monument to bipartisanship in American foreign policy: &quot;his legacy continues.&quot;

Recently, &quot;the Senate bestowed a unique honor on the Michigan senator,&quot; voting to add his portrait to a &quot;very select collection&quot; in the United States Senate Reception Room.

A new book about Vandenberg&#x27;s bipartisan relationship with the Truman administration reinforced the importance of their cooperation.

<text>Marchwood is a village and civil parish located in Hampshire, England. It lies between Totton and Hythe on the western shore of Southampton Water and directly east of the New Forest. The population of the village in the 2011 census was 6,141.

==History==
Marchwood has seen human activity since Roman times. The Roman road from the Calshot/Lepe area passed through here on its way to Nursling (&quot;Onna&quot; as it was called). Roman coins have been found at Bury Farm.

The name &quot;Marchwood&quot; is most probably from the Old English &quot;merecewudu&quot; meaning &quot;smallage wood&quot; (&quot;smallage&quot; is a term for wild celery). It is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Merceode&quot;, when the manor was held by Alwin, whose father Wulfgeat held the manor before 1066.

The manor of Marchwood eventually became known as Marchwood Romsey. John de Romsey held the vill of Marchwood in 1316. He was succeeded by Sir Walter Romsey of Rockbourne, who died in 1403–4 holding land in Marchwood. The manor then passed in the same way as the manor of Romsey Horseys, until the death of Thomas Horsey in 1477.

John Romsey of Tatchbury died in 1494 holding the manor from John Horsey, as did his son, another John Romsey who died in 1503. His son William Romsey sold the manor to Henry White. The manor passed from Robert White to his son William in 1564–5. In 1587 William White sold the manor to Nicholas Venables. William Rickman died in possession of the manor in 1599, leaving his daughter Katherine wife of David Urry his heir. A hundred years later, David Urry, described as of St. James, Westminster, sold the manor to Gilbert Serle of Leghorn, and it subsequently passed to Sir William Oglander. The manor afterwards passed into the Saunders family.

One other manor close to Marchwood was called Bury (also Newton Bury). It occurs in a deed of the 13th century as the &quot;manor of Eling called Burylond.&quot; In the 16th century it was absorbed into Colbury manor, and it is now represented by Bury Farm just north of Marchwood.

Marchwood was at one time in the parish of Eling, and is situated in that part of the ancient parish which lies low at the mouth of the River Test, southeast of Eling village. Cracknore, in Marchwood, was the landing place of the ferry from Southampton long before the Hythe Ferry. There was an important beacon site here at Beacon Hill, receiving and sending messages to both ends of the Isle of Wight. Marchwood became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1843, and a civil parish in 1894. The church was built and endowed by Horatio Francis Kingsford Holloway in 1843. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were Government gunpowder magazines and a Metropolitan Police barracks in Marchwood.

Marchwood Military Port was built here during World War II, which played a vital role in the Normandy landings. The Royal Navy Ordnance Depot was where the famous Mulberry harbours were made. The port continues to service Britain&#x27;s overseas military interests.

Despite being a village, Marchwood is the home of a refuse incinerator known as Marchwood Incinerator (the remains of a previous incinerator, closed in the 1990s were finally pulled down in 2012), a sewage works, a large military port and a natural gas fuelled combined cycle power station known as Marchwood Power Station. replacing an older station which was dismantled during the 1980s. The 842 megawatt facility is one of the most efficient generators of electricity in the UK at 58% fuel efficiency. Until privatisation, Marchwood was home to one of the three principal research facilities of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), concentrating on heavy plant – the other facilities were at Leatherhead and at Berkeley.

==Education==
Marchwood has two schools, an infant school situated in Twiggs Lane and a junior school in the village centre. The nearest secondary schools are Applemore College in Dibden Purlieu and Hounsdown School in Totton. The village does not have a public library. Nearby libraries are in Totton and Hythe.

==Transport==

===Road===
Marchwood is most easily accessed by road via the A326 road (Marchwood Bypass) which runs from the M27 motorway, past Totton, Marchwood and Hythe, as far as the village of Holbury. This then lets down the Access roads of Jacobs Gutter Lane, Staplewood Drive and Twiggs Lane. The main point of access from the south (towards Hythe) is Hythe Road.
Bluestar operates one daytime bus route through Marchwood every hour Monday to Saturday. The 8 service goes to Southampton via Totton in one direction and to Hythe and Calshot in the other. There is limited public transport from the village in the evenings.
===Rail===
Marchwood railway station opened on the Fawley Branch Line beside Main Road on 20 July 1925. The station was closed by the Beeching Axe on 14 February 1966 and has remained closed since. Freight trains still operate on the line and a set of manual level crossing gates are still used on Main Road. Hampshire County Council have agreed to fund a study into reopening the Waterside line between Totton and Hythe, with a stop at Marchwood.

==Religious sites==
Marchwood has four Christian churches. The Parish Church of St. John&#x27;s; The Gospel Church; New Forest Community Church; and Fijian church, which meets in the army estate, mainly for those from Fiji posted in the military houses and barracks.
The churches are active in the community: The New Forest Community Church run a local coffee shop in the village centre, the &quot;sweet soul cafe&quot;; The Gospel Church runs a Friday afternoon cafe &quot;refreshers&quot;, ladies&#x27; and men&#x27;s social groups, and various youth and children&#x27;s clubs, meeting on Sundays at 10.30am at the Infant school; and the Parish church has strong links with the local schools.

==Sport==
Marchwood is home to Staplewood Training Ground the training facilities of Southampton F.C. There is also Lloyds recreation ground which is home to a host of football clubs, as well as two tennis courts.

<doc id="820041" wikidata="Q206079" url="?curid=820041" title="Cissoid of Diocles">
<text>In geometry, the cissoid of Diocles (; named for Diocles) is a cubic plane curve notable for the property that it can be used to construct two mean proportionals to a given ratio. In particular, it can be used to double a cube. It can be defined as the cissoid of a circle and a line tangent to it with respect to the point on the circle opposite to the point of tangency. In fact, the curve family of cissoids is named for this example and some authors refer to it simply as &quot;the&quot; cissoid. It has a single cusp at the pole, and is symmetric about the diameter of the circle which is the line of tangency of the cusp. The line is an asymptote. It is a member of the conchoid of de Sluze family of curves and in form it resembles a tractrix.

==Construction and equations==

Let the radius of be . By translation and rotation, we may take to be the origin and the center of the circle to be (&quot;a&quot;, 0), so is . Then the polar equations of and are:
:formula_1

By construction, the distance from the origin to a point on the cissoid is equal to the difference between the distances between the origin and the corresponding points on and . In other words, the polar equation of the cissoid is
:formula_2
Applying some trigonometric identities, this is equivalent to
:formula_3

Let in the above equation. Then
:formula_4
are parametric equations for the cissoid.

Converting the polar form to Cartesian coordinates produces
:formula_5

===Construction by double projection===

A compass-and-straightedge construction of various points on the cissoid proceeds as follows. Given a line and a point not on , construct the line through parallel to . Choose a variable point on , and construct , the orthogonal projection of on , then , the orthogonal projection of on . Then the cissoid is the locus of points .

To see this, let be the origin and the line as above. Let be the point ; then is and the equation of the line is . The line through perpendicular to is

:formula_6

To find the point of intersection , set in this equation to get
:formula_7
which are the parametric equations given above.

While this construction produces arbitrarily many points on the cissoid, it cannot trace any continuous segment of the curve. 

===Newton&#x27;s construction===

The following construction was given by Isaac Newton. Let be a line and a point not on . Let be a right angle which moves so that equals the distance from to and remains on , while the other leg slides along . Then the midpoint of describes the curve.

To see this, let the distance between and be . By translation and rotation, take and the line . Let and let be the angle between and the -axis; this is equal to the angle between and . By construction, , so the distance from to is . In other words . Also, is the -coordinate of if it is rotated by angle , so . After simplification, this produces parametric equations
:formula_8
Change parameters by replacing with its complement to get
:formula_9
or, applying double angle formulas,
:formula_10
But this is polar equation 
:formula_11
given above with .

Note that, as with the double projection construction, this can be adapted to produce a mechanical device that generates the curve.

==Delian problem==
The Greek geometer Diocles used the cissoid to obtain two mean proportionals to a given ratio. This means that given lengths and , the curve can be used to find and so that is to as is to as is to , i.e. , as discovered by Hippocrates of Chios. As a special case, this can be used to solve the Delian problem: how much must the length of a cube be increased in order to double its volume? Specifically, if is the side of a cube, and , then the volume of a cube of side is
:formula_12
so is the side of a cube with double the volume of the original cube. Note however that this solution does not fall within the rules of compass and straightedge construction since it relies on the existence of the cissoid.

Let and be given. It is required to find so that , giving and as the mean proportionals. Let the cissoid 
:formula_5
be constructed as above, with the origin, the point , and the line , also as given above. Let be the point of intersection of with . From the given length , mark on so that . Draw and let be the point where it intersects the cissoid. Draw and let it intersect at . Then is the required length.

To see this, rewrite the equation of the curve as 
:formula_14
and let , so is the perpendicular to through .
From the equation of the curve,
:formula_15
From this,
:formula_16
By similar triangles and . So the equation becomes
:formula_17
so 
:formula_18
as required.

Diocles did not really solve the Delian problem. The reason is that the cissoid of Diocles cannot be constructed perfectly, at least not with compass and straightedge. To construct the cissoid of Diocles, one would construct a finite number of its individual points, then connect all these points to form a curve. (An example of this construction is shown on the right.) The problem is that there is no well-defined way to connect the points. If they are connected by line segments, then the construction will be well-defined, but it will not be an exact cissoid of Diocles, but only an approximation. Likewise, if the dots are connected with circular arcs, the construction will be well-defined, but incorrect. Or one could simply draw a curve directly, trying to eyeball the shape of the curve, but the result would only be imprecise guesswork.

Once the finite set of points on the cissoid have been drawn, then line will probably not intersect one of these points exactly, but will pass between them, intersecting the cissoid of Diocles at some point whose exact location has not been constructed, but has only been approximated. An alternative is to keep adding constructed points to the cissoid which get closer and closer to the intersection with line , but the number of steps may very well be infinite, and the Greeks did not recognize approximations as limits of infinite steps (so they were very puzzled by Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes).

One could also construct a cissoid of Diocles by means of a mechanical tool specially designed for that purpose, but this violates the rule of only using compass and straightedge. This rule was established for reasons of logical — axiomatic — consistency. Allowing construction by new tools would be like adding new axioms, but axioms are supposed to be simple and self-evident, but such tools are not. So by the rules of classical, synthetic geometry, Diocles did not solve the Delian problem, which actually can not be solved by such means.

==As a pedal curve==

The pedal curve of a parabola with respect to its vertex is a cissoid of Diocles. The geometrical properties of pedal curves in general produce several alternate methods of constructing the cissoid. It is the envelopes of circles whose centers lie on a parabola and which pass through the vertex of the parabola. Also, if two congruent parabolas are set vertex-to-vertex and one is rolled along the other; the vertex of the rolling parabola will trace the cissoid.

==Inversion==
The cissoid of Diocles can also be defined as the inverse curve of a parabola with the center of inversion at the vertex. To see this, take the parabola to be &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;2, in polar coordinate formula_19 or: 
:formula_20

The inverse curve is thus:
:formula_21

which agrees with the polar equation of the cissoid above.

<text>Alpha Omicron Pi (, AOII, Alpha O) is an international sorority founded on January 2, 1897, at Barnard College on the campus of Columbia University in Manhattan, New York City.

&quot;AOII,&quot; and &quot;Alpha O,&quot; the familiar names of the fraternity, is open to women regardless of ethnicity, religion or socio-economic background, with over 140 active collegiate chapters and 159 active alumnae chapters in Canada and the U.S.A. The fraternity is headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, and is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference. Major symbolism includes the color cardinal, the ruby and the &#x27;Général Jacqueminot&#x27; rose. The fraternity publishes a magazine for the benefit of members, named &quot;To Dragma&quot;.

Alpha Omicron Pi was founded on the ideas found in the object of the fraternity—character, dignity, scholarship, and college loyalty.

==History==
The sorority was founded January 2, 1897, at Barnard College by four women: Jessie Wallace Hughan, Helen St. Clair Mullan, Elizabeth Heywood Wyman, and Stella George Stern Perry. They pledged one another in the Columbia Law Library to begin their fraternity. Within one week of its founding, the four founders used their initiation ritual for the first time to initiate Anne Richardson Hall.

National expansion began in 1898 with the founding of &quot;Pi chapter&quot; at Sophie Newcomb College, now part of Tulane University, in New Orleans. Stella George Stern Perry, who was then the president of the fraternity, contacted a New Orleans classmate, Evelyn Reed, who expressed compatible ideas about fraternities. Reed&#x27;s sister, Katherine Reed, became the first pledge of &quot;Pi chapter&quot;. After being initiated by Perry, Katherine Reed found others to initiate.

In 1905, Alpha Omicron Pi joined the National Panhellenic Conference.

In 1967, the fraternity partnered with the Arthritis Foundation. In 1999, the fraternity&#x27;s national council voted to establish AOII Properties, a branch which manages individual chapter housing, including safety, finances, and maintenance. The subsidiary was then officially formed in 2001 but did not begin to transfer local housing contracts to national corporation control until 2009.

== Symbols ==
Alpha Omicron Pi has one official color, cardinal, and is the only member of the NPC to have one official color. Its official flower is the &#x27;Général Jacqueminot&#x27;, or Jacqueminot rose. Alternatively, a deep red rose may be used.

The fraternity&#x27;s official jewel is the ruby, while its mascot is the giant panda, which the fraternity unofficially adopted in 1976 but made official in 2017. The mascot is the panda due to their friendliness and having no natural born enemies. 

Members of the fraternity wear three different pins depending on membership status. New members who have not been initiated wear a gold sheaf of wheat pin (the sheaf itself being the official symbol of the fraternity) bound by a ribbon bearing the letters AOII, symbolizing individuals bound together by friendship. After initiation, members may wear the membership badge with the ruby at the apex. When the fraternity establishes a new charter, the founding members wear gold rose charter member pins which symbolize new growth.

== Philanthropy ==

Alpha Omicron Pi participates in fundraising and volunteer efforts via its philanthropic arm, the Alpha Omicron Pi Foundation. The foundation allocates grants to the fraternity&#x27;s philanthropy, arthritis research, as well scholarships, educational grants, and emergency funds for fraternity members. The funds also support conference speakers, training events, and personal development programs for members.

The fraternity is partnered with the Arthritis Foundation. The partnership began in 1967, with the fraternity members contributing volunteer hours and fundraising events to raise money for arthritis research and camps for juvenile arthritis. Stuffed panda bears are collected each year to give to children attending Arthritis Foundation camps and conferences. The fraternity&#x27;s national campaign for arthritis awareness is “AOII Goes Blue,” with local chapters creating individual chapter events. &quot;Strike Out Arthritis!&quot; (SOA) Is the fraternity&#x27;s signature fundraising event. SOA Events are held each year at Major League Baseball games, since the fraternity cites &quot;strong relationships [with] Major League Baseball teams.&quot; Individual chapters hold their own SOA events which vary from bowling tournaments to pageants to barbecues with funds going to AOII Foundation specifically for arthritis research.

Other programs the fraternity supports is Sisters for Soldiers, where members collect items and write letters to soldiers.

== Programs ==
The Ruby Fund are grants that are raised by alumnae and collegiate members awarded to past initiated sisters in need of financial help from sisters. Applications for assistance are reviewed and ultimately chosen by the Foundation&#x27;s Ruby Fund Committee.

== Chapters ==
== Members ==

Since 1897, the fraternity has initiated over 209,000 members in 205 collegiate chapters across the United States and Canada, with 136 active chapters.

<text>&quot;The City in the Sea&quot; is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. The final version was published in 1845, but an earlier version was published as &quot;The Doomed City&quot; in 1831 and, later, as &quot;The City of Sin&quot;. The poem tells the story of a city ruled by a personification of Death using common elements from Gothic fiction. The poem appeared in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;, &quot;The American Review&quot;, the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot;, as well as in the 1850 collection &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot;.

Poe drew his inspiration from several works, including &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

==Analysis==
The city is one in the west ruled by Death who is revered above all: &quot;While from a proud tower in the town, Death looks gigantically down.&quot; This is another classic Poe poem in that it deals with death and presents it in a non-conventional way. It is seen as a god that rules over a glorious, peaceful city in the west. There are &quot;Domes and spires and kingly halls, and fanes and Babylon like walls&quot; That the city is in the west is appropriate, because the west, in which the sun sets, has traditionally been associated with death. At the end of the poem a &quot;stir in the air&quot; or a wave moves the towers so that they create &quot;A void within the filmy heaven.&quot; Poe speaks in the last part of the poem of the end of days when &quot;the waves now have a redder glow, the hours are breathing faint and low.&quot; The waves turning red is a sign of hell&#x27;s coming, because red is the color of fire and hence the color of hell and the devil. &quot;And when, amid no earthly moans, Down, down the town shall settle hence, Hell rising from a thousand thrones, shall do it reverence.&quot; The last lines of the poem speak of the devil&#x27;s gratitude to death in allowing him to come forth and rule over Earth.

In addition, the end suggests that this city is more evil than Hell for it will hold the city of Death in reverence. It is suggested that Death may be worse than the Devil.

The weird setting and its foreboding remoteness in &quot;The City in the Sea&quot; is a common device of Gothic fiction. This combines with the poem&#x27;s theme of a self-conscious dramatization of doom, similar to Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeper&quot; and &quot;The Valley of Unrest.&quot;

==Inspiration==
Poe was inspired at least in part by Flavius Josephus&#x27;s &quot;History of the Jewish Wars&quot;, a first-century account of the Biblical city of Gomorrah. The poem also bears a resemblance to Lucretius&#x27;s classical poem &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot; and, specifically, an English translation by John Mason Good. Thirty-five of eighty-five consecutive lines parallel the work. Poe&#x27;s last version of the poem may also reference Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; with the term &quot;proud tower&quot;. The mood and style of the poem also seem to echo &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, known to be a heavy influence on Poe&#x27;s poetry.

==Publication history==
An early version of the poem, titled &quot;The Doomed City&quot;, appeared in Poe&#x27;s 1831 collection simply called &quot;Poems&quot;. It was reworked, as many of Poe&#x27;s works, and published in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; in August 1836 as &quot;The City of Sin&quot;. It was first printed under the title &quot;The City in the Sea&quot; in the April 1845 issue of the &quot;American Review&quot;. The poem also appeared in the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot;, in the August 30, 1845 issue. It was included by Rufus Wilmot Griswold in the tenth edition of &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot; in 1850, the year after Poe&#x27;s death, as an example of Poe&#x27;s best poetry.

==Critical reception==
Poe was accused of plagiarizing part of the poem from a poem called &quot;Musing Thoughts&quot;, first published in 1829 in &quot;The Token.&quot; Both poems include a line about a &quot;thousand thrones&quot;. Even so, it is considered one of his best poems from his early years.

==Adaptations and influence==

&quot;The Proud Tower&quot; by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Barbara Wertheim Tuchman, subtitled &quot;A portrait of the world before the War: 1890-1914&quot;, New York: Macmillan, 1966, derives its title and contains an epigraph from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s 1845 version of the poem &quot;The City in the Sea&quot;.

A performed version of the poem was included on the 1997 album &quot;Closed on Account of Rabies&quot;, though the name of the poem was given as &quot;The City and the Sea&quot;.

Basil Rathbone narrated the story in the Caedmon audio collection &quot;Edgar Allan Poe: The Edgar Allan Poe Audio Collection&quot;, Caedmon Records – CD 4148(5), released on CD in 2000.

The German metal band The Ocean used &quot;The City in the Sea&quot; as lyrics, only swapping a few lines to fit rhythmical patterns of the song. It was used both due to the band&#x27;s love of Poe, and the themes common to both poem and band. The song appeared on their 2006 album &quot;Aeolian&quot;.
The 1965 film &quot;War-Gods of the Deep&quot; — alternately titled &quot;City in the Sea&quot; and &quot;The City Under the Sea&quot; — is credited as being loosely based on Poe&#x27;s poem, which is recited at the end of the production.

In 1989 Danish composer Poul Ruders wrote a piece &quot;The City in the Sea&quot; (subsequently released on a CD by Bridge Records, New York) for Symphony Orchestra and Contralto, making full use of Poe&#x27;s text. The composition is also available in a version for 11 instruments (2013).

<text>María Sabina Magdalena García (22 July 1894 – 22 November 1985) was a Mazatec &quot;sabia&quot; (wise woman), shaman and poet who lived in Huautla de Jiménez, a town in the Sierra Mazateca area of the Mexican state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. Her healing sacred mushroom ceremonies, called &quot;veladas&quot;, were based on the use of psilocybin mushrooms, particularly &quot;Psilocybe caerulescens&quot;, a sacred mushroom important to the Mazatecs. María Sabina&#x27;s veladas contributed to the popularization of indigenous Mexican ritual use of entheogenic mushrooms among westerners, though this was not her intent. 

== Life and death ==
María Sabina was born outside of Huautla de Jiménez in the Sierra Mazateca toward the end of the 19th century. Though Sabina herself was not sure, she believed her birth year was 1894. Her parents were both &quot;campesinos&quot;; her mother was María Concepción, while her father, Crisanto Feliciano, died from an illness when she was three years old. She had a younger sister, María Ana. Her grandfather and great-grandfather on her father&#x27;s side were shamans as well, skilled in using the mushrooms to communicate with God, according to their beliefs. After the death of her father, her mother moved the family into town, and Sabina grew up in the house of her maternal grandparents.

María Sabina died in poverty, suffering from malnutrition later in life.

== Interaction with the Western world ==
María Sabina&#x27;s interactions with the Western world, starting with R. Gordon Wasson, have been described, from an indigenous perspective, as &quot;a story of extraction, cultural appropriation, bioprospecting, and colonization.&quot; María Sabina was named by foreigners the first contemporary Mexican &quot;curandera&quot; to allow Westerners to participate in the healing ritual known as the &quot;velada&quot;. María Sabina herself stated that she was not a curandera, that she was in fact a sabia, and that a sabia and curandera are not the same practice. Before becoming a sabia, María Sabina tried curanderismo but felt it to be very wrong for her.

All participants in the ritual ingested psilocybin mushroom as a sacrament to open the gates of the mind. The &quot;velada&quot; is seen as a purification and a communion with the sacred.

In 1955, American ethnomycologist and banker R. Gordon Wasson, and his wife Valentina, a Russian pediatrician and scientist, as well as a passionate mycology enthusiast, visited María Sabina&#x27;s hometown, where Gordon Wasson participated in a &quot;velada&quot; with her. Wasson was the first outsider to take part in the &quot;velada&quot;, and to gain access to the ceremony (which was used to locate missing people and important items), Wasson lied and told her that he was worried about his son back home and wanted information about his whereabouts and well-being, later admitting that this was a deception. The Wassons collected spores of the fungus, which they identified as &quot;Psilocybe mexicana&quot;, and took them to Paris. The fungus was cultivated in Europe and its primary psychoactive ingredient, psilocybin, was isolated in the laboratory by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in 1958.

Wasson wrote a book about his experience of the ritual in a 1957 &quot;Life&quot; magazine article, Seeking the Magic Mushroom; María Sabina&#x27;s name and location were not revealed. However, as author Michael Pollan notes, &quot;Wasson was halfhearted in his desire to protect María Sabina&#x27;s identity&quot; – Wasson later published 512 copies of his two-volume book called &quot;Russia, Mushrooms and History&quot;, the second volume of which revealed her identity and location, an action which has been described as violating her consent and abusing her hospitality. The information was contained in an account of his and his wife&#x27;s first &quot;velada&quot; with Aurelio Carreras, María Sabina&#x27;s son-in-law, on 15 August 1953, two years before they consumed the mushrooms themselves.

Young people from the United States began seeking out María Sabina and the &quot;magic&quot; mushrooms as early as 1962, with numerous hippies, scientists, and other people visiting the remote isolated village of Huautla de Jimenez. Many 1960s celebrities, including Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and Keith Richards, were rumored to have visited María Sabina, but these claims cannot be substantiated as no photographic evidence or written reports of the visits by the rock stars themselves have ever been reported. 
Their lack of respect for the sacred and traditional purposes caused María Sabina to remark: Before Wasson, nobody took &quot;the children&quot; simply to find God. They were always taken to cure the sick.
As the community was besieged by Westerners wanting to experience the mushroom-induced hallucinations, Sabina attracted attention from the Mexican police who believed her to be a drug dealer. The unwanted attention completely altered the social dynamics of the Mazatec community and threatened to terminate the Mazatec custom. The community blamed Sabina; consequently she was ostracized, her house was burned down, her son was murdered, and she was briefly jailed. Sabina later regretted having introduced Wasson to the practice, but Wasson contended that his only intention was to contribute to the sum of human knowledge, despite being funded by the CIA&#x27;s mind control project MKUltra. The way that he is credited in modern history with &quot;discovering&quot; the power of the sacred mushrooms, has been described as a narrative which &quot;mimic[s], in many ways, the colonialist language of &quot;discovery&quot;.&quot;

From 1967 to 1977 life returned to normal conditions for Huautla de Jimenez and the Mazatec after the Mexican Army blocked American, European and Mexican hippies or other unwanted visitors from entering on the only roads into the town. A few Federales also patrolled the town to evict undesirable foreign visitors.

Álvaro Estrada wrote a biography of María Sabina that was translated into English by Henry Munn. Sabina spoke only Mazatec and many of her supposed quotes in English are not verified. Munn, who had lived in Huautla de Jimenez and knew the Mazatec language, wrote two reports on sacred mushroom &quot;veladas&quot; and &quot;curanderos&quot;: &quot;The Mushrooms of Language&quot; was about the traditional ceremonies of the typical curanderos in Huautla; the second was called &quot;The Uniqueness of María Sabina&quot;. Another book on her song-poem chants was &quot;María Sabina: Selections&quot; by Jerome Rothenberg. &quot;The Sacred Mushroom of Mexico&quot;, by Brian Akers, has excerpts from five Mexican authors translated from Spanish to English. &quot;Los Hongos Alucinantes&quot; (in Spanish) by Fernando Benitez dispels many rumors about her life. 

The book &quot;Sacred Mushroom Rituals: The Search for the Blood of Quetzalcoatl&quot;, by Tom Lane, has several chapters by the author on the experiences he, his wife, and a friend had at her home in a &quot;velada&quot; with María Sabina and her daughter Appolonia. The book reports on María&#x27;s musical tonal songs, poetic expressions, ventriloquy, incantations and chanting during the &quot;velada&quot;. The rituals before the ceremony and prayers for the participants are similar to those recorded by Wasson in his visits during the mid-1950s. After publishing his book on ethnomycology, &quot;Russia, Mushrooms and History&quot;, Wasson wrote &quot;María Sabina and her Mazatec Mushroom Velada&quot; with George and Florence Cowan and Willard Rhodes, which included four cassette recordings and the musical score of Sabina&#x27;s &quot;veladas&quot;, with lyrics translated from Mazatec to Spanish to English. Henry Munn later translated these songs into English in Álvaro Estrada&#x27;s book.

The entheogenic use of the sacred mushrooms &quot;(hongos sagrados)&quot; practiced by María Sabina had roots in Pre-Columbian Mexico. By her meeting R. Gordon Wasson and her &quot;veladas&quot; being recorded in the mid-1950s, these ancient Mazatec ceremonies and rituals entered Western knowledge systems, although they existed within Mazatec culture, intentionally hidden, for centuries. Similar ceremonies were recorded in the late Post-Classic Mesoamerican Mixtec codex &quot;Yuta Tnoho&quot; or &quot;Vindobonensis Mexicanus I&quot; (Latin), written in the 16th century, and in the Three Stelae of Xochimilco, but until Wasson met María Sabina in the early 1950s there was almost no proof that the sacred mushroom healing and divination ceremonies and rituals actually existed. Academics note that before Wasson&#x27;s account, there was &quot;little to no evidence&quot; of the medicinal properties of the psilocybin mushrooms in western scientific literature, thus confirming the pivotal role that Sabina and the Mazatec community had in all Western uses of the mushrooms.

== Use of synthetic entheogens ==
In 1958, the French mycologist Roger Heim brought psilocybin tablets to María Sabina and the first &quot;velada&quot; using the active principle of the mushrooms rather than the raw mushrooms themselves took place. In 1962, R. Gordon Wasson and Albert Hofmann went to Mexico to visit her. They also brought a bottle of psilocybin pills. Sandoz was marketing them under the brand name Indocybin—&quot;indo&quot; for both Indian and indole (the nucleus of their chemical structures) and &quot;cybin&quot; for the main molecular constituent, psilocybin. Hofmann gave his synthesized entheogen to the &quot;curandera&quot;. &quot;Of course, Wasson recalled, Albert Hofmann is so conservative he always gives too little a dose, and it didn&#x27;t have any effect.&quot; Hofmann had a different interpretation: &quot;activation of the pills, which must dissolve in the stomach, takes place after 30 to 45 minutes. In contrast, the mushrooms when chewed, work faster as the drug is absorbed immediately&quot;. To settle her doubts about the pills, more were distributed. María, her daughter, and the shaman, Don Aurelio, ingested up to 30 mg each, a moderately high dose by current standards but not perhaps by the more experienced practitioners. At dawn, their Mazatec interpreter reported that María Sabina felt there was little difference between the pills and the mushrooms. She thanked Hofmann for the bottle of pills, saying that she would now be able to serve people even when no mushrooms were available.

Chemical compounds derived from the Psilocybe mushrooms Sabina introduced to Wasson now form part of pharmaceutical products which are patented and now worth billions of dollars. However, Mazatec indigenous communities who are responsible for discovering and stewarding the medicinal properties of psilocybin mushrooms do not hold any of these patents, and as such do not benefit financially at all from their contribution. Ethical concerns have been raised about the way that the Mazatec&#x27;s indigenous knowledge was commodified and profited from, without any acknowledgement, recognition or involvement of the indigenous roots of this knowledge, which came via Sabina.

== Chants and poetry ==
Álvaro Estrada, a fellow Mazatec, recorded her life and work and translated her chants. Estrada&#x27;s American brother-in-law, Henry Munn, translated many of the chants from Spanish to English, and wrote about the significance of her language. Munn wrote that María Sabina brilliantly used themes common to Mazatec and Mesoamerican spiritual traditions, but at the same time was &quot;a unique talent, a masterful oral poet, and craftsperson with a profound literary and personal charisma&quot;. Mexican poet Homero Aridjis described her as &quot;the greatest visionary poet in twentieth-century Latin America.&quot; 

It is sung in a shamanic trance in which, as she recounted, the &quot;saint children&quot; speak through her:

== Cultural impact ==
Sabina is regarded as a sacred figure in Huautla. At the same time, her image is used to market various local commercial ventures, from restaurants to taxi companies.

The Mexican counterculture has an affinity for Sabina. The Mexican rock group Santa Sabina is named after her, and El Tri, one of the first and most successful rock groups in Mexico, dedicated the song &quot;María Sabina&quot; to her, proclaiming her &quot;un símbolo de la sabiduría y el amor&quot; (&quot;a symbol of wisdom and love&quot;).

Mexican musician, Jorge Reyes, included prerecorded chants of María Sabina in the track &quot;The Goddess of the Eagles&quot;, in his album &quot;Comala&quot;. Reyes also used more of the recording in his collaboration with Deep Forest on the track &quot;Tres Marías&quot;, from the Album Comparsa.

Italian Photographer, Gusmano Cesaretti, published a book, &quot;Maria Sabina: en busca del Cristo Negro&quot;, about his experience meeting Maria Sabina in 1982.

Bolivian singer Luzmila Carpio has recorded a song in honor of María Sabina.

Mexican poet and novelist Homero Aridjis has written a novel, &quot;Carne de Dios&quot;, about María Sabina, her life in Huautla and her experience with Westerners who flocked to her home to experience the hallucinogenic effects of the mushrooms. Aridjis brought María Sabina to Mexico City for medical treatment towards the end of her life. Huautla de Jimenez was without electricity and few signs of the 20th century until after María Sabina died in 1985. The Mazatec sacred mushroom &quot;veladas&quot; have survived into the 21st century and are now accepted by the Catholic Church there.

<text>Henry Laurens Mitchell (September 3, 1831 – October 14, 1903) was an American lawyer, judge, and politician. He served as the 16th Governor of Florida (1893–1897).

== Biography ==
Mitchell was born near Birmingham in Jefferson County, Alabama. His family moved to Tampa when he was 15 years old. Mitchell studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1849 at the age of 18.

When the American Civil War began, Mitchell resigned from his post as State Attorney and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Mitchell was such a strong supporter of Southern nationalism that he had two members of his Masonic lodge expelled for fighting in the Union Army. In July 1863, Mitchell left the Confederate Army to take a seat in the Florida House of Representatives, to which he had been elected while serving. He was reelected after the war, in 1873 and 1875. His brother Charles Mitchell later became the Florida Commissioner of Land and Immigration, the modern equivalent of the Commissioner of Agriculture.

In 1888, Mitchell was appointed to the Florida Supreme Court, serving as an associate justice until 1891, when he resigned to start campaigning for governor. He won the election. During his term as governor, Mitchell was paid $3500 per year.

After he left office, Mitchell returned to Hillsborough County, where he was elected as clerk of the circuit court and subsequently county treasurer there. He died in Tampa on October 14, 1903, and was buried at Oaklawn Cemetery.

In 1915, Henry Mitchell Elementary School opened and was named after him.

<doc id="820126" wikidata="Q784331" url="?curid=820126" title="Bill Woodfull">
<text>William Maldon Woodfull (22 August 1897 – 11 August 1965) was an Australian cricketer of the 1920s and 1930s. He captained both Victoria and Australia, and was best known for his dignified and moral conduct during the tumultuous bodyline series in 1932–33. Trained as a schoolteacher, Woodfull was known for his benevolent attitude towards his players, and his patience and defensive technique as an opening batsman. Woodfull was not a flamboyant player, but was known for his calm, unruffled style and his reliability in difficult situations. His opening pairing with fellow Victorian Bill Ponsford for both his state and Australia remains one of the most successful in history. While not known for his tactical skills, Woodfull was widely admired by his players and observers for his sportsmanship and ability to mould a successful and loyal team through the strength of his character.

Woodfull started playing cricket from a young age without distinction. He made his professional debut in Melbourne&#x27;s district competition staying until the age of 19. He made his first-class debut for Victoria at the age of 24 late in 1921–22. After scoring a century in his second match, Woodfull was promoted to open the following season, and he opened for the rest of his career. After scoring three centuries, including a 236, in 1925–26, he was selected for the 1926 tour of England. Regarded as one of the last players selected, Woodfull scored a double century and century in his first two innings in England to earn his debut in the first Test. Woodfull made eight centuries during the tour and topped the Australian averages and was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

Upon returning to Australia, Woodfull established his partnership with Ponsford, and in 1926–27 Shield season, they put on a record-breaking 375-run opening stand, setting up a world record first-class team score of 1107. Woodfull was appointed as vice-captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928–29 home Ashes series following a spate of retirements. He carried his bat in a record-breaking first Test defeat. Although England easily won 4–1, Woodfull scored three centuries, and added his best first-class score for 275 not out. Woodfull reluctantly became captain in 1930 when Ryder was dropped, and his team was derided as the worst Australian squad to tour England. It was the youngest squad to leave Australia, prompting commentators to label the team &quot;Woodfull&#x27;s kindegarten&quot;. After losing the first Test, Woodfull scored a century as Australia levelled the series and they won the fifth Test to regain the Ashes. Woodfull ended the tour with six first-class centuries. In 1931–32 Woodfull had his most successful Test series in his career, against South Africa, scoring 421 runs at 70.17, including his Test highest score of 161.

In 1932–33, great controversy erupted during England&#x27;s tour of Australia. The visitors used bodyline tactics—persistently aiming at the upper bodies and heads of the Australian batsmen in the hope of stifling the hosts&#x27; strong batting line-up. The Australian public and cricket community abhorred the tactic, but Woodfull refused to retaliate or complain publicly. The controversy peaked during the third Test at the Adelaide Oval. Woodfull was felled by a blow to the heart, almost provoking a riot. After Woodfull was dismissed, English manager Plum Warner came to privately express his sympathy, to which Woodfull famously replied &quot;I do not want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not.&quot; England completed a convincing 4–1 victory, but Woodfull was much praised for his stoic public behaviour.

In 1934, Woodfull led the Australians back to England for a tour that was to mend relations after assurances had been given that bodyline would not be repeated. The Australians won 2–1, and Woodfull remains the only captain to regain the Ashes twice. Woodfull retired after the tour; his family claimed that the bodyline controversy had sapped his passion for cricket. A mathematics teacher, Woodfull went on to become headmaster at his alma mater, Melbourne High School.

==Style==

Woodfull batted in a manner which had little aesthetic pleasure or grace, with Wisden describing stating that &quot;at first sight, he gave the impression of being clumsy&quot;. Affected by a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood, he had stiff-jointed style, and played with little noticeable backlift. This gave the impression of a laboured playing style. Despite this, he scored consistently through good placement and powerful drives generated by his strong forearms. Despite his leaden appearance, he often advanced down the pitch to spin bowling. He was known for playing with a straight bat and a close watch on the ball, which were the core features of a strong defensive ability. He typically took block on leg stump and shuffled across to cover his stumps. His defensive prowess yielded names such as &quot;the unbowlable&quot; (a reference to the fact that he was rarely bowled as a result of missing the ball) and &quot;wormkiller&quot;. The latter epithet was given to him by English bowlers who said that his backlift was so small that it was only enough to decapitate worms that had raised their heads above ground level. He was also known for his reliability in crisis match situations, leading to epithets such as &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;Old Steadfast&quot;. Woodfull formed an opening partnership with Bill Ponsford at state and international level which yielded 18 century opening stands. Dubbed &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; by teammates after the famous comic strip duo, as well as &quot;Willy Wo and Willy Po&quot;, they were regarded as one of the finest opening partnerships in Test history. Their Victorian teammates had such faith in the pair that if they were batting, the wicket-keeper and bowlers who batted low in the order would leave the ground to go to work.

As a captain, Woodfull was known for his courage and high moral principles in the face of the bodyline series. Fellow player Stan McCabe described him as &quot;the greatest man I ever met&quot;, while wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield said that he had never met a more exemplary character. Oldfield said that Woodfull was a psychologist and humanitarian in addition to a captain. Bradman attributed Woodfull&#x27;s success to his ability to command the intense loyalty of his players and convert it into team spirit. Bill O&#x27;Reilly said that Woodfull&#x27;s men &quot;all held imperishable memories of his personal touch and his courage&quot;. Ray Robinson said that &quot;nobody thought Bill Woodfull the cat&#x27;s whiskers as a strokeplayer but his many qualities made him a pre-eminent leader of men&quot;. He added that &quot;Woodfull&#x27;s unrivalled selflessness won fidelity bordering on devotion&quot;. Australian cricket writer Jack Pollard said that &quot;Woodfull had the habit of being where things were tough, and he brought rare dignity to the Australian captaincy&quot;. Pollard compared the respect he commanded from his players to that of Ian Chappell. The English writer RC Robertson-Glasgow said of Woodfull:

Woodfull was known for his gentlemanly nature and his adherence to the spirit of the game. Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline, Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen. On one occasion, Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of the crease to inspect the pitch, without intending to run. A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal, but Woodfull called Fingleton back. He led his team in an understated way, preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil the task at hand. However, he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly.

Although Woodfull was a devout Methodist, he would show a deep concern in the personal welfare of all players, which extended to finding the location of the nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion. At the time, Australian society at large was divided along Catholic-Protestant lines, and while O&#x27;Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull, they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against the leadership of the Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late-1930s. While Woodfull himself never touched alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles, he did not impose his beliefs on his team. He would buy drinks for his players, and ask administrators to provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted. At the time, cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of rehydration, and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused his players more ale on the grounds that they had already consumed their quota.

==Early years==

Born in the central Victorian town of Maldon, Woodfull was the third of four sons of Gertrude Lilian (Abey) Woodfull (1872–1941) and Rev. Thomas Staines Brittingham Woodfull (1863–1941), a Methodist preacher. The Woodfulls moved to Melbourne when Thomas was given a transfer to Collingwood Methodist Mission, in an inner city suburb. The religious traditionalism stayed with the younger Woodfull throughout his life. He once refused to play an interstate match that was scheduled for Christmas Day. Woodfull&#x27;s father installed a net in the backyard and taught him the emphasis on defensive technique and patience that were to become his hallmark. Woodfull attended Melbourne High School and his early career was unremarkable. He made his district cricket debut in 1916 for Essendon, at the age of 19, but did not distinguish himself. He played no further cricket at that level before he gained his qualification as a schoolteacher in 1919. Because of a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood, Woodfull had stiff muscles and as a result was rejected when he tried to join the First Australian Imperial Force to fight in World War I. He was posted to Maryborough High School, and it was in the rural cricket competition that he began to gain attention. In 1920 and 1921, he accumulated 1,335 runs at average of 225.83 in the local competition.
When the England cricket team toured Australia in 1920–21, Woodfull played for a Ballarat XV, and scored 50 and 1. A teaching transfer in 1921 saw him return to Melbourne, where the Victorian selectors trialled him in Second XI fixtures during the 1921–22 season. In two matches against South Australia and New South Wales, he registered unbeaten scores of 186 and 227 respectively. At the time, Victoria had so much depth that their Second XI was of comparable strength to the first-choice teams from other states.

In early 1922, he made his Sheffield Shield debut against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He batted at No. 8 and made an unbeaten 22. Batting at No. 7 in his second match against Western Australia, Woodfull registered his maiden first-class century with 153. He was run out in his second and final innings of his debut first-class season, so he was yet to be dismissed by a bowler. Both matches were won by an innings, part of a dominant summer for the Victorians. During this time, he also studied for an arts degree at night in addition to his post at Williamstown High School.

The following season, Woodfull was promoted to open and his consistent performances in all conditions meant that he was to play there for the rest of his career. Between 1922 and 1926, he accumulated over 3,000 first-class runs at an average of 67.

In the first match of the 1922–23 season, Woodfull scored 74 run out and four not out as Victoria scraped past the Marylebone Cricket Club by two wickets. The next match against New South Wales was Woodfull&#x27;s first against Victoria&#x27;s arch-rivals. Woodfull made 47 in the first innings before being dismissed by Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey. After exactly 300 first-class runs, a bowler had dismissed him for the first time. He then made an unbeaten 84 to steer his team to a seven-wicket victory. He showed a liking for the South Australian bowlers, scoring 0, 115, 123 and 94 not out as Victoria won both of their matches against the aforementioned team. He ended his first full season with 598 runs at 74.75. Despite this, Victoria lost the Sheffield Shield to New South Wales on scoring difference; both teams had finished equal on points.

He played in each match for the Victorian Sheffield Shield team in the 1923–24 season, when he scored 300 runs at 37.50, including a 117 against New South Wales. Victoria won all five of their matches and took the title.

In a match against New South Wales in 1924–25, he compiled 81 and 120 not out as Victoria managed to take a seven-wicket win after their opponents had accumulated 614 in the first innings. He scored fifties in each of the four other matches, three of which were won. Woodfull ended the Australian season with 494 runs at 61.75. Woodfull was nevertheless omitted for selection in the Tests against the touring England team. As a reward for winning the Sheffield Shield, Victoria embarked on a tour of New Zealand at the end of the season. Woodfull scored 212 not out against Canterbury, before scoring 110, 50 and 150 against New Zealand without being dismissed at all. The unbeaten 150 was achieved on a sticky wicket. He ended the tour with 706 runs at 176.50. In one two-year period, Woodfull&#x27;s defence was so solid that he was never bowled.

During the 1925–26 season, players were vying for selection for the 1926 Ashes tour. The selectors were interested in Woodfull and selected him for an Australian XI to play the Rest of Australia in a Test trial. He made 11 and 42 as The Rest upset the Australian XI. After three matches without passing 53, Woodfull added 97 and 236 in a match against South Australia. He scored 126 in the next match, but was unable to stop an innings defeat to New South Wales for the second time in the season.

As a result of consistent performances for Victoria, Woodfull was selected for Herbie Collins&#x27; Test team for the 1926 Ashes tour. He scored 148 and 64 as the Australians defeated Tasmania by an innings in consecutive matches before sailing for England. He ended the Australian season with 890 runs at 63.57.

==Test debut==

Despite being regarded as the last man picked for the tour, Woodfull headed the batting averages in the first-class matches and was third in the Tests.

In his first two first-class innings on tour, Woodfull struck a 201 against Essex at Leyton and a 118 against Surrey at The Oval. Both were made on damp pitches, with the double century coming in only four hours of batting. Woodfull&#x27;s effort was the only double century by an Australian during the tour. They were the first of eight centuries during the tour, in which he compiled 1809 runs at 58.35.

After making a duck against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was a dress rehearsal for the Tests as the MCC fielded a virtual England team, Woodfull scored an unbeaten 98 against Cambridge University before running out of partners. He added 69 against the South of England and 100 against Middlesex and entered the Tests with 653 runs on tour at an average of 59.36.

Woodfull made his debut in the first Test at Trent Bridge, but it was an anti-climax; Australia did not bat in a washed-out match as England reached 0/32 when rain ended play. He failed to make an impression in the second Test at Lord&#x27;s, scoring 13 and a duck in another drawn match. It capped off an unhappy June for Woodfull; he had scored only 120 runs at 13.33 for the month, with rain interruptions being frequent.

Woodfull then regained his form, striking 102 not out in an innings win over Nottinghamshire. He then established himself as a Test opener in the third Test at Headingley, where Australia were sent in to bat on a sticky wicket with erratic bounce. After opening partner Warren Bardsley was dismissed without scoring from the first ball, Woodfull put on a second wicket partnership of 235 with Charlie Macartney to register his maiden Test century of 141. Macartney launched a vicious counterattack and became the second Australian to score a Test century before lunch on the opening day; this bold play helped Woodfull to settle in and the Australians to seize the initiative on a bowler-friendly surface. The tourists made 494 on the sticky wicket and forced England to follow on, but were unable to finish them off.

After scoring 65 against Lancashire, Woodfull made it back-to-back Test centuries in the fourth Test at Old Trafford with 117, the highest score of the innings. It was another rain-affected draw in a wet summer, Woodfull followed this with 156 in another weather-curtailed match against Surrey.

The first four Tests were drawn, so the fate of the Ashes depended on the fifth Test, which would be timeless. Woodfull could manage only 35 and a duck as Australia lost the Test by 289 runs and thus the Ashes. His 306 runs at 51.00 in the Tests placed him third behind Bardsley and Macartney. In the closing stages of the tour, Woodfull compiled his eighth and final century of the campaign, an unbeaten 116 against an England XI in a drawn match.

Upon his return to Australia, he established his partnership with Bill Ponsford, and in the 1926–27 Shield season, they put on a 375-run opening stand in less than four hours, which laid the foundation for the world record first-class score of 1107 against New South Wales. The stand eclipsed the Sheffield shield record of 298 for the first wicket by Victor Trumper and Reg Duff in 1902–03. Woodfull made 133 and the Victorians won by an innings and 656 runs. He ended the season by scoring 140 and 29 not out as the Australian XI defeated The Rest by seven wickets. He scored two further fifties and ended the season with 483 runs at 69.00 in five matches. He then toured Malaya and Singapore with Bert Oldfield&#x27;s team during the off-season, scoring three centuries; none of the matches were first-class.

In 1927–28 Australian season, Woodfull played in five matches and was highly productive in the last three. He scored 99 and 191 not out in a victory over New South Wales, before adding 106 in an innings triumph over South Australia. He rounded off the season with 94 and 81 not out in a draw in the return match against New South Wales. He ended the Australian campaign with 645 runs at 129.00. With Ponsford amassing 1217 runs at 152.12, Victoria usually got off to a strong start with the bat, and won the Shield easily.

Woodfull recorded his career best score of 284, compiled in five and a half hours of batting, during a brief tour to New Zealand as part of an Australian XI at the end of the season. He added 184 for the first wicket with Ponsford and 218 for the fourth with Karl Schneider. He scored centuries in the first two matches before adding fifties in the next two. He ended the first-class matches with 781 runs at 130.16.

Woodfull was appointed as vice-captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928–29 home Ashes series. The Australian board had spent a great deal of time arguing over whether Woodfull or Victor Richardson should be Ryder&#x27;s deputy, before realising that the selectors had omitted the latter. With six members of the team that played in the last Test in 1926 having retired, Australia would field a young and inexperienced team. Woodfull prepared for the Tests with an unbeaten 67 for Victoria in a drawn tour match against Percy Chapman&#x27;s touring Englishmen.

Woodfull played his first Test on Australian soil in the first Test at Brisbane. He made a duck in the first innings as Australia fell for 122 to concede a 411-run first innings lead. before Australia were forced to chase 742 for victory. Woodfull carried his bat to make an unbeaten 30 as Australia were skittled for 66 on a sticky wicket to lose by a record 675 runs. Woodfull then made 68 to top-score in the first innings of the second Test in Sydney. Australia conceded another mammoth first innings lead, 383. Woodfull then scored his first Test century in Australia, with 111 in the second innings to force the tourists to bat again. Despite this, England scored 2/16 to win the match.

The third Test was Woodfull&#x27;s first at his home ground in Melbourne, and despite scoring 107 in the second innings, the tourists won by three wickets in front of Test world record crowd. Woodfull made only one and 30 as Australia fell short by 12 runs in the fourth Test in Adelaide, but ended the season on a high.

In a tour match against the Englishmen, Woodfull made 275 not out for Victoria, his highest score for his state. During the match, Woodfull was captain and had agreed with English captain Chapman to vary rules that had been laid by the Australian Board of Control. The two men agreed to cover the pitch throughout the match and to bowl overs of six balls instead of eight. The Australian Board of Control reacted by reprimanding the Victorian Cricket Association. The match was a high-scoring draw.

The teams returned to Melbourne for the fifth Test, where Woodfull scored 102 and 35 in front of his home crowd as Australia won by five wickets. It was the first time that Woodfull had played in a winning Test, after ten matches. He hit three centuries in the series, with 491 runs at 54.56, despite which Australia lost the series 4–1. Woodfull ended the entire season with 854 runs at 85.40.

Woodfull started the 1929–30 Australian season by scoring an unbeaten 100 against the touring MCC, overseeing a successful run-chase. However, his season was cut short in the third match when he suffered a broken hand after being hit by a short ball from Hugh Thurlow in a match against Queensland. Woodfull was forced to retired hurt and recovered just in time for the warm-up matches against Tasmania before the national team headed to England. He had scored 231 runs at 77.00 in five matches during the season.

==Captaincy==

After the heavy 4–1 defeat in the previous Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian Jack Ryder was omitted altogether from the 1930 Ashes tour, and Woodfull appointed captain. Ryder was one of the three selectors and advocated his own retention, but his two colleagues had voted him off. At first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring, Woodfull only agreed after a ballot was organised. He was unanimously selected by the board. Woodfull had limited leadership experience and in his brief captaincy duties had been the first captain to declare his team&#x27;s second innings in Shield history.

After winning the vote, Woodfull led the youngest fifteen-man squad to ever tour England, with eleven never having played on English soil. Commentators expected Australia to be easily defeated, being described as &quot;the weakest squad ever to come to these shores&quot;. In some quarters, the team was dubbed &quot;Woodfull&#x27;s kindergarten&quot;.

The tour started with a match against Worcestershire, with Woodfull scoring a century and Don Bradman making 236* in 275 minutes. Woodfull&#x27;s first game in command ended with a resounding innings victory. He added 54 in a win over Essex and scored 121 a drawn match against Yorkshire, the dominant county of the era with many leading Test players. Woodfull then added consecutive fifties in draws against the MCC and Surrey. After consecutive innings wins of Oxford University and Hampshire, Woodfull completed his Test preparation by striking 216 in an innings win over Cambridge University. Heading into the Tests, Woodfull had amassed 662 runs at 66.20. However, concerns over the Australian bowling attack prompted Woodfull and the senior players to ask the board to send another spinner. This was refused.

However, Woodfull&#x27;s Test captaincy started poorly in the first Test at Trent Bridge; he scored two and four as Australia fell to a 93-run defeat, after losing their last seven wickets for 104. Immediately after, he scored 141 against Surrey.

He set the tone with an opening stand of 162 with fellow Victorian Ponsford in the second Test at Lord&#x27;s. Ponsford was dismissed immediately after the teams had an audience with King George V. Woodfull then made a 231-run stand with Bradman (254) in only two and a half hours and reached 155. Australia put themselves in control with 6/729 declared. Woodfull was unbeaten on 26 in the second innings as Australia reached 72 to complete a seven-wicket triumph. Woodfull then won the toss for the first time and contributed 50 to a stand of 192 with Bradman in the third Test at Headingley (the match in which Bradman scored 309 in a day). Australia reached 566 but rain helped England to a draw after being forced to follow on. Woodfull scored 54 as the fourth Test was rained out before the second innings. With the series tied at 1–1 the fifth Test at The Oval was a timeless match. Woodfull won the toss and after England made 405, he scored 54 as Australia amassed 695 to win by an innings and regain the Ashes 2–1. During the Tests, Woodfull had contributed 345 runs at 57.50, second only to Bradman. In all first-class matches, he compiled 1,435 runs at 57.36 including six centuries. Woodfull and his fellow Victorian Ponsford played a significant part by making three century opening stands—162 at Lord&#x27;s, 159 at The Oval and 106 at Old Trafford to help Australia take the initiative in three Tests. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that &quot;No praise is too high for Woodfull&quot; and commended the Australian captain&#x27;s encouragement of his young team.

Upon returning to Australia, Woodfull was elected as Victoria&#x27;s delegate on the five-man national selection panel, replacing Ryder. However, he resigned from the role before the next international series, thereby never participating in the selection of a Test team.

This was followed by home series against the West Indies in 1930–31, the first Test tour of Australia by the Caribbean side. Ahead of the Tests, Victoria defeated the tourists by an innings and 254, but Woodfull was unable to score any runs against his Test opponents, making a duck.

In the Tests, Woodfull unselfishly broke up his opening combination with Ponsford by dropping down to No. 6 to accommodate the prodigiously talented young batsman Archie Jackson. Woodfull was uncomfortable batting out of position, scoring six, 58 and 17 in the first three Tests. Woodfull batted only once in each Test, as Australia easily won the first Test by ten wickets, and the next two by an innings. Woodfull was restored to the top of the order for the fourth Test in Melbourne after Jackson&#x27;s illness became too much, forcing the young batsman to withdraw from competition. Woodfull struck 83 run out as Australia took a third consecutive innings victory. He then scored his first century for the season, making 177 and 27 not out in a state match against South Australia.

However, Australia&#x27;s winning run came to an end with a 30-run loss in the fifth Test, with Woodfull scoring 22 and 18. He ended the series with a modest 204 runs at 34.00 as Australia won 4–1. He ended the summer with 477 runs at 47.70.

The following season saw a tour to Australia by the South Africans for the first time in two decades. Woodfull started the season by scoring 121 and leading his state to an 88-run win over the tourists ahead of the Tests. It was a signal of what was to follow in the Tests. He then managed only 32 and nine as Victoria narrowly lost to South Australia by 21 runs.

Woodfull scored 74 and 58 as Australia took innings victories in the first two Tests over the South Africans in Brisbane and Sydney. He then scored 147 to script a three-wicket win over arch-rivals New South Wales, after Victoria had been forced to chase 434 for victory.

In the third Test in Melbourne, Australia found themselves on the back foot for the first time in the series. Woodfull scored only seven in the first innings, as Australia made only 198 and South Africa took a 160-run lead. He then compiled his Test best of 161 in the second innings, adding 274 in partnership with Bradman in only three hours, to help Australia make 554 and set up a 169-run win. It was the second successive Test season in which Woodfull had saved his highest Test score of the series for his home crowd. He continued his run with 82 and 37 not out in the fourth Test, which was won by ten wickets.

Woodfull had an opportunity to inflict more blows on the tourists as Victoria played them for the second time ahead of the final Test. While his state was unable to force a result, Woodfull continued his strong form with 44 and 73 not out. The Australian captain finished the season with a duck from the opening ball of the fifth Test, bowled after failing to offer a shot, but Australia won by an innings and 72 runs in the equivalent of a single day&#x27;s play on a sticky wicket.

Woodfull opened for the entire series, and returned his best ever series figures of 421 at 70.17, second only to Bradman. The 5–0 result remains the only time that Australia has clean-swept South Africa over five Tests. He ended the season with 849 runs at 65.31.

===Bodyline===

In 1932–33, the English team led by Douglas Jardine toured Australia and won the Ashes in a very acrimonious series. It has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities.

England&#x27;s &quot;bodyline&quot; tactics, which involved bowling at speeds of around 150 km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended away from the upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised the tactics in an attempt to curb Donald Bradman, Australia&#x27;s star batsman, whose average hovered around 100, around twice that of all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.

During the season, Woodfull&#x27;s physical courage, stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers. He refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit— according to Ken Piesse, 34 times in all. Once the issue was resolved, and practice stopped, Woodfull refused to discuss the matter, fearing that it would disturb the peace.

Woodfull started the season strongly, scoring 74 and 83 in a loss to New South Wales in the second match of the summer, but was soon confronted by Jardine&#x27;s Englishmen. He made five and 25 as England crushed Victoria by an innings. Although England did aim at the batsmen&#x27;s body, they did not enforce the second half of the &quot;Bodyline&quot; structure, by not packing the leg side. This changed in the next match, when Woodfull led an Australian XI against the tourists in Melbourne, in what was effectively a Test rehearsal. With Jardine rested from the match, his deputy Bob Wyatt used the full &quot;Bodyline&quot; tactics for the first time. The match was drawn and Woodfull struggled, making 18 and a duck. Utilising his hopping technique and attempting to play unorthodox shots resembling overhead tennis smashes, Bradman failed to make an impact, and England were buoyed ahead of the Tests.

Australia lost heavily by ten wickets in the first Test at Sydney, when the bodyline spearhead, Harold Larwood, took ten wickets, while Woodfull managed only seven and a duck. Before the second Test in Melbourne, Woodfull had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors. This caused the toss to be delayed and fomented speculation that the Australian Board of Control were considering the possibility of removing Woodfull because of his absolute refusal to allow his bowlers to use retaliatory tactics. His deputy Victor Richardson had advocated retaliation along with several other players. Richardson recalled Woodfull&#x27;s private response:

Although Woodfull led Australia to a dramatic victory by 111 runs, his form was a problem as he managed only 10 and 26; he was also hit by the bowling. The bodyline controversy reached its peak during the second day of the third Test. An all-time record Adelaide Oval crowd of 50,962 watched Australia finish off England&#x27;s first innings for 341. Then, Woodfull opened Australia&#x27;s batting with Jack Fingleton, who was dismissed straight away for a duck. Minutes later Larwood, bowling to a conventional field setting, struck Woodfull an agonising blow under his heart with a short, lifting delivery. As Woodfull bent down over his bat in pain for several minutes, an image that became one of the defining symbols of the series, the huge crowd began jeering, hooting and verbally abusing the English team, something that was almost unheard of for the social standards of the era. Jardine reacted by saying &quot;Well bowled, Harold&quot;.

When play resumed, England&#x27;s Gubby Allen bowled an entire over to Bradman. As Larwood prepared to bowl his next over to Woodfull, Jardine changed to the &quot;Bodyline&quot; field setting. The capacity Saturday afternoon crowd viewed this as hitting a man when he was down. Journalist-cricketer Dick Whitington, wrote that Jardine&#x27;s actions were seen as &quot;an unforgivable crime in Australian eyes and certainly no part of cricket&quot;. Mass hooting and jeering occurred after almost every ball. Whitington noted that &quot;[Umpire] Hele believes that had what followed occurred in Melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and belaboured the English captain; Larwood, and possibly the entire side&quot;. Some English players later expressed fears that a large-scale riot and that the police would not be able to stop the irate home crowd, who were worried that Woodfull or Bradman could be killed, from attacking them. When Larwood immigrated to Australia two decades later, he remained fearful for his safety.

During the over, another rising Larwood delivery knocked the bat out of Woodfull&#x27;s hands. He battled it out for 89 minutes, collecting more bruises before Allen bowled him for 22. Later in the day, the English team manager Pelham Warner visited the Australian dressing room to express his sympathies to Woodfull. Woodfull had remained calm in public, refusing to complain about Jardine&#x27;s tactics. Woodfull&#x27;s abrupt response was meant to be private, but it was leaked to the press and became the most famous quotation of this tumultuous period in cricket history:

Woodfull reportedly added &quot;This game is too good to be spoilt. It&#x27;s time some people got out of it&quot;, hinting that he might withdraw his team from competition in protest. Australia&#x27;s Leo O&#x27;Brien later reported that Warner was close to tears following Woodfull&#x27;s rebuke. Australian singer Paul Kelly reflected on Woodfull&#x27;s character in this incident in his song &quot;Bradman&quot;:


In the meantime, the second innings in Adelaide saw England set Australia a near-impossible 532 for victory; even today, the highest successful Test run chase is 418. Australia lost its first wicket at three when Jack Fingleton was bowled by Larwood. Woodfull was joined by Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually all out for 193, with Oldfield unable to bat due to his fractured skull.

Woodfull made scores of 67, 19, 14 and 67 in the final two Tests, which Australia lost by six and eight wickets respectively. In the fifth Test in Sydney, Larwood broke a bone in his foot, but Jardine made him complete the over, even though the laws of cricket permit a captain to switch bowlers mid-over in the case of injury. Larwood stood stationary at the wicket and bowled without a run-up, but Woodfull refused to take advantage of the injured bowler. He blocked the five remaining deliveries back down the wicket towards Larwood and refused to take a run.

England reclaimed the Ashes 4–1. Overall, Woodfull had scored 305 runs at a moderate 33.89 average—it was the slowest scoring rate for his career, but significantly, he had defied the English bowling for over twenty hours in total, more than any other Australian. Amid the high drama of the season, Woodfull&#x27;s struggles spread beyond the Test arena; he scored only 297 runs at 33.00 in matches outside the Tests.

In 1933–34 cricket returned to normality with the departure of Jardine&#x27;s men. Woodfull scored 118 in a one-off match between his XI and Richardson&#x27;s XI, which ended in a draw. He then scored 129 in the run-chase as The Rest of Australia narrowly defeated New South Wales by two wickets. Woodfull scored fifties in both interstate matches against New South Wales and added consecutive centuries for the national team against Tasmania before departing for his final tour of England. He ended the season with 818 runs at 62.92, returning to form after the tumult of the previous summer.

===International farewell===

In 1934, having been reappointed to a position on the selection panel, Woodfull led Australia back to England on a tour that had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket diplomacy of the previous bodyline series. After agreements were put in place so that bodyline would not be used, the tour went ahead. However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.

Woodfull started his final English campaign slowly. In his first eight innings, he scored only 161 runs at 20.12 with one half-century. Other players sensed that Woodfull had become less cheerful following the bodyline series and he offered to drop himself following his run of poor form, but fellow selectors Bradman and Alan Kippax disagreed. In the traditional Test rehearsal against the MCC, Australia reduced the hosts to be eight down in their second innings, still in arrears when the match ended in a draw. In his final innings before the Tests, Woodfull struck form with 172 not out against Lancashire.

In the first Test at Trent Bridge, Woodfull struck 26 and two. Australia led by 106 on the first innings and although Woodfull was so concerned with batting England out of the match that he declared with less than five hours remaining on the final day, his men went on to win by 238 runs, albeit with only ten minutes of play remaining. England struck back in the second Test at Lord&#x27;s. Woodfull made 22 as Australia replied to England&#x27;s 440 with 284. The hosts enforced the follow on as rain breathed life into the pitch, and Woodfull made 43 as Australia were all out for 118 in an innings defeat.

He then scored 73 run out, his only fifty in the Tests, as Australia made 491 and ceded a 136-run lead in the third Test at Old Trafford. However, they held on for a draw. Woodfull made a duck in the fourth Test at Headingley, but another Bradman triple century put them in control before rain shortened the match; England still needed 155 runs to make Australia bat again with only four wickets in hand when the match ended. The draw meant that the series was at 1–1 heading into the final Test at The Oval, which would be timeless.

In the lead-up to the decider, Woodfull ran into form. In consecutive innings, he scored 131 and 228 not out against Gloucestershire and Glamorgan respectively. However controversy followed in a match against Nottinghamshire. In the first innings, Woodfull scored 81 as Australia batted first and made 237. Bill Voce, one of the bodyline practitioners of 1932–33, employed it with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height.

Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce&#x27;s leg side bowling was repeated, his men would leave the field and return to London. He further said that Australia would not return to the county in future. The following day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury. Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day. Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.

When the teams took to the field for the deciding Test, Woodfull won the toss and elected to bat. He scored 49 as Australia amassed 701 in the timeless match. England replied with 321, and Woodfull made 13 in his final Test innings. The tourists made 327 and set England a target of 708 for victory. His bowlers then dismissed the hosts for 145 to seal a decisive win by 562 runs, and the series 2–1. On 22 August, for the second time in four years, Australia had won the Ashes on Woodfull&#x27;s birthday.

The victory made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes twice. He scored 1,268 runs at 52.83 during the tour with three centuries. His tally of 25 Tests as captain was a world record and remained unsurpassed for a quarter of a century.

Woodfull performed poorly in the Tests, with 228 runs at 28.50, but it was sufficient for an Australian triumph as Bradman and Ponsford each averaged over 90 and Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O&#x27;Reilly each took over 25 wickets. Woodfull was criticised by Robinson for his relatively defensive captaincy, tending to bat opponents out of the match instead of going directly for victory from the off. Woodfull relied on O&#x27;Reilly and Grimmett, using only three specialist bowlers as he sought to reinforce the batting line-up. However, he was effective in curtailing leading English batsmen Wally Hammond. When Woodfull was captaining Australia, Hammond only averaged half as much as he did when another player was captaining Australia.

He retired immediately after the tour and was awarded a joint testimonial with Ponsford on his return to Victoria. The match raised a total of 2,084 Australian pounds. In this match between Woodfull&#x27;s XI and Richardson&#x27;s XI, he scored 111 in his final innings, as his men made 316 in reply to 196. Woodfull then took his only wicket at first-class level in the second innings and his team reached the target of 280 with seven wickets in hand without him having to bat.

In early 1935, Woodfull lost his position as the Victorian delegate on the national selection panel after being defeated by William Johnson in a vote.

==Retirement==

Outside cricket, Woodfull spent several years as headmaster at Box Hill High School then had a successful career as a mathematics teacher at Melbourne High School, and was headmaster for six years. He was known for his stern discipline throughout his career. One of his students was future Australian Test all rounder and Australian Cricket Hall of Fame inductee Keith Miller, whom he taught in year nine. Miller was a mediocre student, as he did little study and focused his energy on sport. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school motto, which meant &quot;Honour the Work&quot; and exhorted his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Miller scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull&#x27;s geometry class, and was forced to repeat the year. Despite his credentials, Woodfull refused to involve himself in coaching the school&#x27;s cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller&#x27;s skills, writing in the school magazine that &quot;Miller has Test possibilities&quot;. Other notable students included Doug Ring, a leg spinner who was a member of Bradman&#x27;s &quot;Invincibles&quot;, left arm orthodox spinner Jack Wilson and world record breaking Olympic distance runner Ron Clarke. The school oval was later named the Miller-Woodfull Oval.

The rejuvenated Maldon Oval in his home town was renamed the Bill Woodfull Recreation Reserve, and when the Great Southern Stand was constructed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1992, one of the entrances was named the Bill Woodfull Gate.

Woodfull married Gwen King, whom he met while singing in the choir at his father&#x27;s church in Albert Park, and they married after Woodfull&#x27;s return from the England tour in 1926. They had three children. His two sons Jack and Bill Jr, played for Melbourne University Cricket Club and became successful dentists.

In November 1934, the Governor-General informed him that the King had offered him a knighthood, &quot;for services to cricket&quot;, The citation made a veiled reference to Woodfull&#x27;s actions during the bodyline episode. Woodfull always considered his contributions to education more important than anything he ever did on the cricket field, and declined the honour. In later life he said &quot;Had I been awarded it for being an educationalist, then I would have accepted it. But under no circumstances would I accept it for playing cricket.&quot; In 1963, he was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to education. In 1965, while on holiday with his wife and daughter Jill, he collapsed and died while playing golf in Tweed Heads, New South Wales. His family remained adamant that the bruising bodyline attack had permanently damaged his health and curtailed his life. Woodfull was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001, one of the first 15 inductees.

<doc id="820129" wikidata="Q6184441" url="?curid=820129" title="Jerry Singirok">
<text>Jerry Singirok (born 5 May 1956) was the commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force throughout the Sandline affair of 1997.

==Military career==
Jerry Singirok was a career soldier who had risen through the ranks of the Papua New guinea Defense Force (PNGDF), including a time as commander of the forces on Bougainville. He began his Career at Moem Barracks in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) as an Infantryman on The 1st Royal Pacific Islands Regiment (1RPIR). After military service there he was rotated to Lae, Morobe, Igam Barracks Joint Officer Service College where he trained as a commissioned officer. Singirok trained and lectured in Duntroon military academy in Australia on Land Warfare Tactics in Military Science before being requested back to the PNGDF on strict orders during the height of the Sandline Crisis with the rank of captain. In the mid-1990s, he was promoted to Brigadier-General, and given the rank of commander. He was later promoted to the rank of Major-General of the PNGDF in the late 1990s during his second stint as commander.

In 1996, Tim Spicer, an ex-Colonel in the Scots Guards, who had recently founded the mercenary firm Sandline International, met with Singirok. Spicer attempted to persuade Singirok to support a package of military support that Spicer had negotiated with then-defence minister Mathias Ijape. Singirok declined, but the deal went ahead anyway, with the support of Ijape, Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan and Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta.

It is unclear just how much Singirok knew of the events in between that meeting and the leaking of the affair to the international media on 10 February 1997. When the story broke in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper, Singirok was in the Philippines, and the mercenaries were already in Port Moresby. When he returned on 27 February, his mind was made up. He condemned the government for leaving him, as head of the PNGDF, out of the loop, and condemned Spicer for having more access to the government than he did. Over the next week, he made plans for Operation Rausim Kwik (Tok Pisin for &#x27;get rid of them fast&#x27;). On 8 March, he asked Major Walter Enuma to command the operation. Enuma agreed.

==Sandline affair==

On the night of 16 March, Singirok&#x27;s soldiers swooped. They arrested Spicer, the mercenaries, and their support staff. The next morning, Singirok went on national radio, and accused Prime Minister Chan, Defence Minister Ijape, and Deputy Prime Minister Haiveta of corruption, and gave them 48 hours to resign. He also fiercely denied allegations that he was aiming to take power himself. Chan refused to resign, and the same day, sacked Singirok as Commander of the PNGDF, replacing him with the controversial Colonel Alfred Aikung.

That was the end of Singirok&#x27;s direct role in the crisis that followed. However, Enuma carried out Singirok&#x27;s plans in his absence. In the days that followed, the mercenaries were deported, the parliament was surrounded, and Chan, Ijape and Haiveta were all forced to stand down.

Following Sir Julius Chan&#x27;s decision to stand down, Singirok went public with several serious corruption allegations against Chan&#x27;s government. Chan stood again at the following election, but in the wake of the affair and Singirok&#x27;s allegations, not only lost power, but also his seat in parliament.

==Dismissal and subsequent inquiry==
Following the affair, Singirok was dismissed from his position. He faced several inquiries into the events. He was subsequently reappointed in 1998, but dismissed again in 2000 over the same events, after another inquiry.

The 2000 inquiry found Singirok guilty of secretly receiving $US52,000 through his Visa card account in the London-based Lloyds Bank. He was also found guilty of failing to obtain an exemption from the Ombudsman Commission for the payments he received.

Singirok also faced criminal sedition charges, stemming from his radio broadcast of 17 March 1997, stating that he had launched a military revolt to get the mercenaries out of the country. Finally, in March 2004, he was cleared of all other charges.

In recent times, he has spoken out against Australian intervention in the Pacific, particularly the deployment of forces to the Solomon Islands, accusing the country of imperialism. He has also suggested that Papua New Guinea risks becoming a failed state.

==Legacy==
Though his name has been sullied somewhat by the bribery allegations, many still credit Singirok with the end of the Bougainvillean war, which occurred soon after the ousting of the Chan government. In a June 2004 interview with the Port Moresby newspaper &quot;The National&quot;, he stated &quot;Even to this day, I believe strongly as a professional military officer that there was no military solution to bring an end to the civil war on Bougainville.&quot;

Singirok now operates a taxi company &amp; security firm in Port Moresby. He has suggested that after taking a break, he may return to public life.

He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the 2007 general election, in the Sumkar constituency in Madang Province, where he was defeated by Ken Fairweather.

<text>Little Five Points (also L5P, LFP, Little Five, or Lil&#x27; Five) is a district on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, east of downtown. It was established in the early 20th century as the commercial district for the adjacent Inman Park and Candler Park neighborhoods, and has since become famous for the alternative culture it brings to Atlanta. It has been described as Atlanta&#x27;s version of Haight-Ashbury, a melting pot of sub-cultures, and the bohemian center of the Southern United States.

==Name==
The name is a reference to Five Points, which is the center of downtown Atlanta. &quot;Little&quot; Five Points refers to the intersection at the center of the neighborhood. Two points are provided by Moreland Avenue (U.S. 23 and Georgia 42), which runs perfectly north/south, and forms the county line dividing Fulton and DeKalb. Two points are provided by Euclid Avenue, which runs northeast/southwest. The fifth point was originally Seminole Avenue, which met the intersection from the northwest, but the Seminole point was converted to a plaza and there is no longer a five-point intersection, though some regard McLendon Avenue, extending east from Euclid&#x27;s southern intersection at Moreland, as the new fifth point.

==History==
The first Atlanta streetcars were constructed just south of the Little Five Points in the 1890s. According to the National Park Service, as the population grew on Atlanta&#x27;s east side, the area where the trolley lines converged became one of the earliest major regional shopping centers. Little Five Points thrived until the 1960s, when a proposed freeway through the heart of the district drove residents out of the neighborhood.

By the 1970s, Little Five Points had fallen into disrepair. A revitalization began as urban pioneers moved into the then-cheap neighborhood and restored the Victorian-style homes. By 1981, local merchants formed the Little Five Points Partnership to continue the restoration and expansion of the retail area, turning what was formerly a gas station into the &quot;484 retail area&quot; — several retail shops aligned in strip-mall style.

==Geography==
Little Five Points is surrounded by the Inman Park, Edgewood, Candler Park and Poncey-Highland neighborhoods of Atlanta. Immediately to the south on Moreland, just through the DeKalb Avenue and Georgia Railroad underpass, is the Edgewood Retail District, a late-2000s urban infill land development of former Atlanta Gas Light Company land. This provides the area its big-box stores, mostly at the opposite end of the spectrum from the historic Little Five Points. Its smaller shops constructed along Caroline Street, occupied by many chain stores, are done in a small-town &quot;main street&quot; style (with underground parking), and the entire development is done in brick, as Little Five Points originally was.

==Culture==
Little Five Points is renowned for its alternative culture. It is home to metro-wide indie radio station WRFG FM 89.3 as well as many businesses. The neighborhood is featured in the Cartoon Network show &quot;Class of 3000&quot; as well as the &quot;Internet Girls&quot; series of books by Lauren Myracle, who mentions several of the businesses in Little Five Points by name.

The Little Five Points Halloween Festival takes place every year on the Saturday of Halloween. The official L5P Poet used to freestyle poetry in the square and has a mural located in the alleyway between Earthtones and Filthy Wealth; he has not been present in 2014. Local vendors sell arts and crafts and the highlight of the celebration is the Little Five Points Halloween Parade. The parade features local celebrities, bikers in costume, live music, hearses, several local marching bands, and many parade floats that are put together by community action groups and local businesses. Little Five is also the host of Little Five Fest, an annual music festival featuring 50-100 local bands spread across multiple venues.
Unlike most of Atlanta&#x27;s neighborhoods, the street art in Little Five Points is highly concentrated in a compact easily walked area. Works by internationally known street artists can be found as well as works by local artists. Finding the murals can be a bit of a treasure hunt. Many works of street art are tucked away on the back sides of buildings, in alleyways, and in back parking lots. Both the easily visible and hidden gems of street art in Little Five Points are mapped on the Atlanta Street Art Map.

<text>Peter Faber, SJ (, ) (13 April 1506 – 1 August 1546) was a Savoyard Catholic priest, theologian and co-founder of the Society of Jesus, along with Ignatius of Loyola and Francis Xavier. Pope Francis announced his canonization in 2013.

==Life==
===Early life===
Faber was born in 1506 to a peasant family in the village of Villaret, in the Duchy of Savoy (now Saint-Jean-de-Sixt in the French Department of Haute-Savoie). As a boy, he was a shepherd in the high pastures of the French Alps. He had little education, but a remarkable memory; he could hear a sermon in the morning and then repeat it verbatim in the afternoon for his friends. Two of his uncles were Carthusian priors. At first, he was entrusted to the care of a priest at Thônes and later to a school in the neighboring village of La Roche-sur-Foron.

In 1525, Faber went to Paris to pursue his studies. He was admitted to the Collège Sainte-Barbe, the oldest school in the University of Paris, where he shared his lodgings with Francis Xavier. There Faber&#x27;s spiritual views began to develop, influenced by a combination of popular devotion, Christian humanism, and late medieval scholasticism. Faber and Xavier became close friends and both received the degree of Master of Arts on the same day in 1530. At the university, Faber also met Ignatius of Loyola and became one of his associates. He tutored Loyola in the philosophy of Aristotle, while Loyola tutored Faber in spiritual matters. Faber wrote of Loyola&#x27;s counsel: &quot;He gave me an understanding of my conscience and of the temptations and scruples I have had for so long without either understanding them or seeing the way by which I would be able to get peace.&quot; Xavier, Faber, and Loyola all became roommates at the University of Paris and are all recognized by the Jesuits as founders of the Society of Jesus.

===Jesuit preacher===

Faber was the first among the small circle of men who formed the Society of Jesus to be ordained. Having become a priest on 30 May 1534, he received the religious vows of Ignatius and his five companions at Montmartre on 15 August.

Upon graduation, Ignatius returned to Spain for a period of convalescence, after instructing his companions to meet in Venice and charging Faber with conducting them there. After Loyola himself, Faber was the one whom Xavier and his companions esteemed the most. Leaving Paris on 15 November 1536, Faber and his companions rejoined Loyola at Venice in January 1537. When war between Venice and the Turks prevented them from evangelizing the Holy Land as they planned, they decided to form the community that became the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuit Order. The group then traveled to Rome where they put themselves at the disposal of Pope Paul III. After Faber spent some months preaching and teaching, the Pope sent him to Parma and Piacenza, where he brought about a revival of Christian piety.

Recalled to Rome in 1540, Faber was sent to Germany to uphold the position of the Catholic Church at the Diet of Worms and then at the Diet of Ratisbon in 1541. Another Catholic theologian, Johann Cochlaeus, reported that Faber avoided theological debate and emphasized personal reformation, calling him &quot;a master of the life of the affections&quot;. Faber was startled by the unrest that the Protestant movement had stirred up in Germany and by the decadence he found in the Catholic hierarchy. He decided that the remedy did not lie in discussions with the Protestants but in the reform of the Roman Catholic, especially of the clergy. For ten months, at Speyer, at Ratisbon, and at Mainz, he conducted himself with gentleness with all those with whom he dealt. He influenced princes, prelates, and priests who opened themselves to him and amazed people by the effectiveness of his outreach. Faber possessed the gift of friendship to a remarkable degree. He was famous not for his preaching, but for his engaging conversations and his guidance of souls. He crisscrossed Europe on foot, guiding bishops, priests, nobles, and common people alike in the Spiritual Exercises.

As a lone Jesuit often on the move, Faber never felt alone because he walked in a world whose denizens included saints and angels. He would ask the saint of the day and all the saints &quot;to obtain for us not only virtues and salvation for our spirits but in particular whatever can strengthen, heal, and preserve the body and each of its parts&quot;. His guardian angel, above all, became his chief ally. He sought support from the saints and angels both for his personal sanctification and in his evangelization of communities. Whenever he entered a new town or region, Faber implored the aid of the particular angels and saints associated with that place. Through the intercession of his allies, Faber could enter even a potentially hostile region assured of a spiritual army at his side. As he desired to bring each person he met to a closer relationship through spiritual friendship and conversation, he would invoke the intercession of the person&#x27;s guardian angel.

Called to Spain by Loyola, he visited Barcelona, Zaragoza, Medinaceli, Madrid, and Toledo. In January 1542 the pope ordered him to Germany again. For the next nineteen months, Faber worked for the reform of Speyer, Mainz, and Cologne. The Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann of Wied, favored Lutheranism, which he later publicly embraced. Faber gradually gained the confidence of the clergy and recruited many young men to the Jesuits, among them Peter Canisius. After spending some months at Leuven in 1543, where he implanted the seeds of numerous vocations among the young, he returned to Cologne. Between 1544 and 1546, Faber continued his work in Portugal and Spain. Through his influence while at the royal court of Lisbon, Faber was instrumental in establishing the Society of Jesus in Portugal. There and in Spain, he was a fervent and effective preacher. He was called to preach in the principal cities of Spain, where he aroused fervor among the local populations and fostered vocations to the clergy. Among them there was Francis Borgia, another significant future Jesuit. King John III of Portugal wanted Faber made Patriarch of Ethiopia. Simão Rodrigues, co-founder of the Jesuit order, wrote that Faber was &quot;endowed with charming grace in dealing with people, which up to now I must confess I have not seen in anyone else. Somehow he entered into friendship in such a way, bit by bit coming to influence others in such a manner, that his very way of living and gracious conversation powerfully drew to the love of God all those with whom he dealt.&quot; He then worked in several Spanish cities, including Valladolid, Salamanca, Toledo, Galapagar, Alcalá, and Madrid.

===Death===

In 1546, Faber was appointed by Pope Paul III to act as a &quot;peritus&quot; (expert) on behalf of the Holy See at the Council of Trent. Faber, at age 40, was exhausted by his incessant efforts and his unceasing journeys, always made on foot. In April 1546, he left Spain to attend the Council and reached Rome, weakened by fever, on 17 July 1546. He died, reportedly in the arms of Loyola, on 1 August 1546. Faber&#x27;s body was initially buried at the Church of Our Lady of the Way, which served as a center for the Jesuit community. When that church was demolished to allow for the construction of the Church of the Gesù, his remains and those of others among the first Jesuits were exhumed. His remains are now in the crypt near the entrance to the Gesù.

==Writings==
Faber kept a diary of his spiritual life known as his &quot;Memoriale&quot;. Most of it dates from June 1542 to July 1543, with some additional entries from 1545 and a final brief entry made in January 1546. It begins with a quotation from &quot;Psalms&quot;: &quot;Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.&quot; It takes the form of a series of conversations, mostly between God and Faber with occasional contributions on the part of various saints and Faber&#x27;s colleagues.

Peter Faber authored &quot;The Blessed Sacrament&quot; which proffers a strong argument for the existence and nature of God.

==Veneration==
Those who had known Faber in life already invoked him as a saint. Francis de Sales, whose character recalled that of Faber&#x27;s, never spoke of him except as a saint. He is remembered for his travels through Europe promoting Catholic renewal and his great skill in directing the Spiritual Exercises. Faber was beatified on 5 September 1872. His feast day is celebrated on 2 August by the Society of Jesus. Faber was honored as part of the 2006 Jesuit Jubilee Year which celebrated the 500th anniversary of the birth of Francis Xavier, the 500th anniversary of the birth of Peter Faber, and the 450th anniversary of the death of Ignatius Loyola.

Pope Francis, on his own 77th birthday, 17 December 2013, announced Faber&#x27;s canonization. He used a process known as equipollent canonization, which dispenses with the standard judicial procedures and ceremonies in the case of someone long venerated. Faber is regarded as one of Pope Francis&#x27; favorite saints. A few weeks earlier, Francis had praised Faber&#x27;s &quot;dialogue with all, even the most remote and even with his opponents; his simple piety, a certain naïveté perhaps, his being available straightaway, his careful interior discernment, the fact that he was a man capable of great and strong decisions but also capable of being so gentle and loving&quot;. Francis gave further thanks for Faber&#x27;s canonization when he celebrated Mass in Rome on 3 January 2014, at the Church of the Gesù, and made reference to him in a list of Jesuit priests associated with devotion to the Sacred Heart in his 2024 encyclical letter on this subject, &quot;Dilexit nos&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Saint Peter Faber Jesuit Community at Boston College is a residence for Jesuits in formation.

Creighton University confers the Blessed Peter Faber Integrity Award on a student, faculty or staff member who is involved in activities that promote integrity, social justice, peace, and religious, racial, and cultural harmony and is able to inspire and lead others to distill their values and integrity.

Saint Peter Faber House at Gonzaga University is an extension of the University Ministry office reserved for preparing retreats and further developing University Ministry programs.

The Faber Center for Ignatian Spirituality was adopted as a ministry of Marquette University in November 2005.

The Peter Faber Chapel serves as the central space for the University of Scranton&#x27;s Retreat Center at Chapman Lake, about 30 minutes north of Scranton, PA. 

The St. Peter Faber conference room in Loyola Hall at Manresa House of Retreats, Convent, Louisiana, is the location where men on retreat are directed through the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola

The School of Business at Australian Catholic University is known as the Peter Faber School of Business.

Faber Hall at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York, is a residence hall and administrative building.

It was announced in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; on 26 October 2016 that Loyola Press has contracted Jon M. Sweeney, the author of &quot;The Pope Who Quit&quot; and other historical books, to write a new narrative life of Saint Peter Faber.

<text>Alfonso (Alphonsus) Salmerón, SJ (8 September 1515 – 13 February 1585) was a Spanish biblical scholar, a Catholic priest, and one of the first Jesuits.

==Biography==
He was born in Toledo, Spain on 8 September 1515. He studied literature and philosophy at Alcalá and then philosophy and theology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Here, through Diego Laynez, he met St. Ignatius of Loyola and with Laynez, St. Peter Faber and St. Francis Xavier, he enlisted as one of the first companions of Loyola in 1534. The small company left Paris on 15 November 1536, reached Venice on 8 January 1537 and during Lent of that year went to Rome. He delivered a discourse before the Pope and was, in return, granted leave to receive Holy orders so soon as he reached canonical age. About 8 September, all the first companions met at Vicenza and all, save St. Ignatius, said their first Mass. The plan of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land was abandoned. Salmeron devoted his ministry in Siena to the poor and to children. On 22 April 1541, he pronounced his solemn vows in St. Paul&#x27;s-Outside-the-Walls basilica as a professed member of the newly established Society of Jesus.

In the autumn of 1541 Pope Paul III sent Salmeron and Paschase Broët as Apostolic nuncios to Ireland. They landed by way of Scotland on 23 February 1542. Thirty-four days later they set sail for Dieppe and went on to Paris. For two years Salmeron preached in Rome; his exposition of the Pauline Epistle to the Ephesians thrice a week in the church of the Society effected much good (1545). After preaching during Lent at Bologna, he went with Diego Laynez to the Council of Trent (18 May 1546) as theologian to Paul III. The Dogma of Justification was under discussion.

The two Jesuits at once reportedly won the hearts and respect of all; their discourses had to be printed and distributed to the bishops. Both set out for Bologna (14 March 1547) with the council. After serious sickness at Padua, Salmeron once again took up his council work. Salmeron gave statements on issues including justification, Holy Eucharist, penance, purgatory, indulgences, the Sacrifice of the Mass, matrimony and the origin of episcopal jurisdiction.

The next two years were in great part spent in preaching at Bologna, Venice, Padua and Verona. On 4 October 1549, Salmeron and his companions, Claude Le Jay and Peter Canisius, took their doctorate at the University of Bologna, so that they might, at the urgent invitation of William IV of Bavaria, accept chairs in Ingolstadt. Salmeron undertook to interpret the Pauline Epistle to the Romans. Upon the death of Duke William, at the instigation of the Bishop of Verona, much to the chagrin of the faculty of the Academy of Ingolstadt, Salmeron was returned to Verona (24 September 1550). That year he explained the Gospel of St. Matthew.

In 1551 he was summoned to Rome to help St. Ignatius in working up the Constitutions (statutes) of the Jesuit Society. Other work was in store. He was soon (February, 1551) sent down to Naples to inaugurate the Society&#x27;s first college there, but after a few months was summoned by Ignatius to go back to the Council of Trent as theologian to pope Julius III. It was during the discussions preliminary to these sessions that Laynez and Salmeron, as papal theologians, gave their vota first. When the Council once again suspended its sessions, Salmeron returned to Naples (October, 1552). Pope Paul IV sent him to the Augsburg Diet (May, 1555) with nuncio Lippomanus, and thence into Poland and in April, 1556 to Belgium.

Another journey to Belgium was undertaken in the capacity of adviser to Cardinal Giovanni Pietro Caraffa (2 December 1557). Laynez appointed Salmeron first Jesuit Provincial of Naples in 1558 and vicar-general in 1561 during the former&#x27;s apostolic legation to France. The Council of Trent was again resumed (May, 1562) and a third pontiff, Pius IV, chose Salmeron and Laynez for papal theologians. The subject to be discussed was very delicate: the Divine origin of the rights and duties of bishops. During the years 1564–82, Salmeron was engaged chiefly in preaching and writing; he preached every day during eighteen Lenten seasons; his preaching was fervent, learned and fruitful. His writings during this long period were voluminous; Saint Robert Bellarmine spent five months in Naples reviewing them; each day he pointed out to Salmeron the portions that were not up to the mark, and the next day the latter brought back those parts corrected. He died at Naples on 13 February 1585.

==Works==

The chief writings of Salmeron are his sixteen volumes of Scriptural commentaries: eleven on the Gospels, one on the Acts, and four on the Pauline Epistles. Southwell says that these sixteen volumes were printed by Sanchez, Madrid, from 1597 till 1602; in Brescia, 1601; in Cologne, from 1602 to 1604, Sommervogel (&quot;Bibliothèque de la C. de J.&quot;, VII, 479) has traced only twelve tomes of the Madrid edition - the eleven of the Gospels and one of the Pauline commentaries. The Gospel volumes are entitled, &quot;Alfonsi Salmeronis Toletani, e Societate Jusu Theologi, Commentarii in Evangelicam Historiam et in Acta Apostolorum, in duodecim tomos distributi&quot; (Madrid, 1598–1601). The first Cologne edition, together with the second (1612–15), are found complete. These voluminous commentaries are the popular and university expositions which Salmeron had delivered during his preaching and teaching days. In old age, he gathered his notes together, revised them, and left his volumes ready for posthumous publication by Bartholomew Pérez de Nueros. Hartmann Grisar (&quot;Jacobi Lainez Disputationes Tridentinae&quot;, I, 53) thinks that the commentary on Acts is the work of Perez; Braunsberger (Canisii epist., III, 448) and the editors of &quot;Monumenta Historica S. J.&quot; (&quot;Epistolae Salmeron&quot;, I, xxx) disagree with Grisar.

<text>Regimini militantis Ecclesiae (Latin for &quot;To the Government of the Church Militant&quot;) was the papal bull promulgated by Pope Paul III on September 27, 1540, which gave a first approval to the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, but limited the number of its members to sixty. 

==History==
Ignatius of Loyola and his companions had made their way to Rome in October 1538, to offer their priestly services to the pope. As they were about to be dispersed by the various missions given them by the pope, the question arose as to whether they wished to remain spiritually &quot;one&quot;. After prayer and discussion they decided positively: since Christ had brought them together, they felt it was His will they remain united. A charter was proposed to the pope, which was received favourably and ultimately given solemn approval in this &quot;Regimini Militantis Ecclesiae&quot; of 1540. The first group of Jesuits, then known simply as &quot;reformed priests&quot;, proceeded to unanimously elect Ignatius as their Superior General, despite his opposition.

The final approval, with the removal of the restriction on the membership number, , came in the bull &quot;Exposcit debitum&quot; (en: &quot;The duty requires ...&quot;) of July 21, 1550, issued by Pope Julius III. 

The papal text of 1540 included what is known as the &quot;Formula Instituti&quot;. More developed Constitutions were gradually written by Ignatius and approved by the first General Chapter (called &quot;General Congregation&quot;) of the Society of Jesus convened in 1558, two years after Ignatius&#x27; death. This first General Congregation also elected his successor.

==Text==
&quot;Regimini militantis Ecclesiae&quot; reflects the first Jesuits&#x27; vision of themselves, approved by the pope. Perceiving the needs of their time they emphasized preaching and teaching children and unlettered persons in elementary Christian doctrine. They could “set up a college or colleges in universities capable of having fixed revenues, annuities, or possessions which are to be applied to the uses and needs of students” but could not accept such fixed income for their own houses. However, the revenues could be used for the maintenance of the scholastics who taught in the colleges and would be admitted to the Society “after their progress in spirit and learning has become manifest and after sufficient testing.” Jesuits were to accept any missions to which the pope would call them through the superior, and not to themselves negotiate with the Pope about these missions. The superior was to establish constitutions which were to be voted on by those around him.

The full, critically edited Latin text is to be found in the Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu (MHSI), &quot;Constitutiones&quot;, vol.1, Rome, 1934, pp. 24-32. Also in Reich, &quot;Documents&quot;, pp. 216-219, and a condensed version in Robinson, &quot;European History&quot;, ii. 161-165.

<text>In military strategy, a bridgehead (or bridge-head) is the strategically important area of ground around the end of a bridge or other place of possible crossing over a body of water which at time of conflict is sought to be defended or taken over by the belligerent forces.

Bridgeheads typically exist for only a few days, the invading forces either being thrown back or expanding the bridgehead to create a secure defensive lodgement area, before breaking out into enemy territory, such as when the U.S. 9th Armored Division seized the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen in 1945 during World War II. In some cases a bridgehead may exist for months.

==Etymology==

&quot;Bridgehead&quot; (French &quot;tête de pont&quot;) is a High Middle Ages military term, which before the invention of cannons meant the military fortification that protects the end of a bridge. Like many older terms, the meaning of the word drifted with the passage of time, becoming used for something not exactly true to its initial usage.

With the introduction of cannons, the term was morphed to a generalized term for field fortifications lying some distance beyond the ends of the bridge that were emplaced to protect both the bridge and any troops crossing it to the far bank. This term was used in that era when referring to both the fortifications and the small lodgement on the bank which was closest to the enemy. As the process of moving an army over bridges is slow and complicated, it is usually necessary to secure it from hostile interruption, and the works constituting the bridgehead must therefore be sufficiently advanced to keep the enemy&#x27;s artillery out of range of the bridges. As artillery grew in power, so did the size of the lodgements necessary. In addition, room is required for the troops to form up on the further bank. Formerly, with short-range weapons, a bridgehead was often little more than a screen for the bridge itself, but modern conditions have rendered necessary far greater extensions of bridge defenses.

When armies and military formations grew, more lodgement area was required to organize a force large enough to stage a break out against a determined enemy. The technical meaning of the term expanded once again, referring to a large fortified area about at bridge end. With the advent of modern warfare capabilities, including long-range tube artillery and high-powered rifles with effective ranges measured in the thousands of yards (metres), the term of art again had to expand in area, but now morphed to be just an area defended and controlled by ample firepower, with or without constructed fortifications.

The term in colloquial usage refers to any kind of defended area that is extended into hostile territory, also called a and sometimes the technically incorrect &#x27;beachhead&#x27;, which is frequently mistaken colloquially as synonymous terminology. The technical term refers in particular to the specific area on the far side of a defended river bank or a segment of a lake or riverine coastline held by the enemy forces, like the Bridge at Remagen. The term is especially applied when such a territory is initially seized by an amphibious assault with the tactical intent of establishing a supply line across the geographic barrier feature to allow further operational manoeuvring. In that sense, it has much in common with the popular misconception of a beachhead.

<doc id="820253" wikidata="Q1153588" url="?curid=820253" title="Helmholtz decomposition">
<text>In physics and mathematics, the Helmholtz decomposition theorem or the fundamental theorem of vector calculus states that certain differentiable vector fields can be resolved into the sum of an irrotational (curl-free) vector field and a solenoidal (divergence-free) vector field. In physics, often only the decomposition of sufficiently smooth, rapidly decaying vector fields in three dimensions is discussed. It is named after Hermann von Helmholtz.

== Definition ==

For a vector field formula_1 defined on a domain formula_2, a Helmholtz decomposition is a pair of vector fields formula_3 and formula_4 such that:
formula_5
Here, formula_6 is a scalar potential, formula_7 is its gradient, and formula_8 is the divergence of the vector field formula_9. The irrotational vector field formula_10 is called a &quot;gradient field&quot; and formula_9 is called a &quot;solenoidal field&quot; or &quot;rotation field&quot;. This decomposition does not exist for all vector fields and is not unique.

== History ==

The Helmholtz decomposition in three dimensions was first described in 1849 by George Gabriel Stokes for a theory of diffraction. Hermann von Helmholtz published his paper on some hydrodynamic basic equations in 1858, which was part of his research on the Helmholtz&#x27;s theorems describing the motion of fluid in the vicinity of vortex lines. Their derivation required the vector fields to decay sufficiently fast at infinity. Later, this condition could be relaxed, and the Helmholtz decomposition could be extended to higher dimensions. For Riemannian manifolds, the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition using differential geometry and tensor calculus was derived.

The decomposition has become an important tool for many problems in theoretical physics, but has also found applications in animation, computer vision as well as robotics.

== Three-dimensional space ==

Many physics textbooks restrict the Helmholtz decomposition to the three-dimensional space and limit its application to vector fields that decay sufficiently fast at infinity or to bump functions that are defined on a bounded domain. Then, a vector potential formula_12 can be defined, such that the rotation field is given by formula_13, using the curl of a vector field.

Let formula_14 be a vector field on a bounded domain formula_15, which is twice continuously differentiable inside formula_16, and let formula_17 be the surface that encloses the domain formula_16 with outward surface normal formula_19. Then formula_14 can be decomposed into a curl-free component and a divergence-free component as follows:

formula_21
where
formula_22

and formula_23 is the nabla operator with respect to formula_24, not formula_25.

If formula_26 and is therefore unbounded, and formula_14 vanishes faster than formula_28 as formula_29, then one has

formula_30
This holds in particular if formula_31 is twice continuously differentiable in formula_32 and of bounded support.

with outward surface normal formula_19.

Defining

formula_34
formula_35

we finally obtain
formula_36

===Solution space===

If formula_37 is a Helmholtz decomposition of formula_31, then 
formula_39 is another decomposition if, and only if,
:formula_40 and formula_41
:where
:* formula_42 is a harmonic scalar field,
:* formula_43 is a vector field which fulfills formula_44
:* formula_45 is a scalar field.

Proof: 
Set formula_46 and formula_47. According to the definition
of the Helmholtz decomposition, the condition is equivalent to 
:formula_48. 

Taking the divergence of each member of this equation yields 
formula_49, hence formula_50 is harmonic.

Conversely, given any harmonic function formula_50,
formula_52 is solenoidal since
:formula_53

Thus, according to the above section, there exists a vector field formula_54 such that
formula_55.

If formula_56 is another such vector field, 
then formula_57 
fulfills formula_58, hence formula_59
for some scalar field formula_60.

=== Fields with prescribed divergence and curl ===
The term &quot;Helmholtz theorem&quot; can also refer to the following. Let be a solenoidal vector field and &quot;d&quot; a scalar field on which are sufficiently smooth and which vanish faster than at infinity. Then there exists a vector field such that

formula_61

if additionally the vector field vanishes as , then is unique.

In other words, a vector field can be constructed with both a specified divergence and a specified curl, and if it also vanishes at infinity, it is uniquely specified by its divergence and curl. This theorem is of great importance in electrostatics, since Maxwell&#x27;s equations for the electric and magnetic fields in the static case are of exactly this type. The proof is by a construction generalizing the one given above: we set

formula_62

where formula_63 represents the Newtonian potential operator. (When acting on a vector field, such as , it is defined to act on each component.)

=== Weak formulation ===
The Helmholtz decomposition can be generalized by reducing the regularity assumptions (the need for the existence of strong derivatives). Suppose is a bounded, simply-connected, Lipschitz domain. Every square-integrable vector field has an orthogonal decomposition:

formula_64

where is in the Sobolev space of square-integrable functions on whose partial derivatives defined in the distribution sense are square integrable, and , the Sobolev space of vector fields consisting of square integrable vector fields with square integrable curl.

For a slightly smoother vector field , a similar decomposition holds:

formula_65

where .

=== Derivation from the Fourier transform ===
Note that in the theorem stated here, we have imposed the condition that if formula_14 is not defined on a bounded domain, then formula_14 shall decay faster than formula_28. Thus, the Fourier transform of formula_14, denoted as formula_10, is guaranteed to exist. We apply the convention
formula_71

The Fourier transform of a scalar field is a scalar field, and the Fourier transform of a vector field is a vector field of same dimension.

Now consider the following scalar and vector fields:
formula_72

Hence

formula_73

=== Longitudinal and transverse fields ===
A terminology often used in physics refers to the curl-free component of a vector field as the longitudinal component and the divergence-free component as the transverse component. This terminology comes from the following construction: Compute the three-dimensional Fourier transform formula_74 of the vector field formula_14. Then decompose this field, at each point k, into two components, one of which points longitudinally, i.e. parallel to k, the other of which points in the transverse direction, i.e. perpendicular to k. So far, we have

formula_76
formula_77
formula_78

Now we apply an inverse Fourier transform to each of these components. Using properties of Fourier transforms, we derive:

formula_79
formula_80
formula_81

Since formula_82 and formula_83,

we can get

formula_84
formula_85

so this is indeed the Helmholtz decomposition.

== Generalization to higher dimensions ==

=== Matrix approach ===

The generalization to formula_86 dimensions cannot be done with a vector potential, since the rotation operator and the cross product are defined (as vectors) only in three dimensions. 

Let formula_14 be a vector field on a bounded domain formula_88 which decays faster than formula_89 for formula_90 and formula_91.

The scalar potential is defined similar to the three dimensional case as:
formula_92
where as the integration kernel formula_93 is again the fundamental solution of Laplace&#x27;s equation, but in d-dimensional space:
formula_94
with formula_95 the volume of the d-dimensional unit balls and formula_96 the gamma function.

For formula_97, formula_98 is just equal to formula_99, yielding the same prefactor as above.
The rotational potential is an antisymmetric matrix with the elements:
formula_100
Above the diagonal are formula_101 entries which occur again mirrored at the diagonal, but with a negative sign.
In the three-dimensional case, the matrix elements just correspond to the components of the vector potential formula_102.
However, such a matrix potential can be written as a vector only in the three-dimensional case, because formula_103 is valid only for formula_97.

As in the three-dimensional case, the gradient field is defined as
formula_105
The rotational field, on the other hand, is defined in the general case as the row divergence of the matrix:
formula_106
In three-dimensional space, this is equivalent to the rotation of the vector potential.

=== Tensor approach ===

In a formula_86-dimensional vector space with formula_108, formula_109 can be replaced by the appropriate Green&#x27;s function for the Laplacian, defined by
formula_110
where Einstein summation convention is used for the index formula_111. For example, formula_112 in 2D.

Following the same steps as above, we can write
formula_113
where formula_114 is the Kronecker delta (and the summation convention is again used). In place of the definition of the vector Laplacian used above, we now make use of an identity for the Levi-Civita symbol formula_115,
formula_116
which is valid in formula_117 dimensions, where formula_118 is a formula_119-component multi-index. This gives
formula_120

We can therefore write
formula_121
where
formula_122
Note that the vector potential is replaced by a rank-formula_119 tensor in formula_86 dimensions.

Because formula_125 is a function of only formula_126, one can replace formula_127, giving
formula_128
Integration by parts can then be used to give
formula_129
where formula_130 is the boundary of formula_16. These expressions are analogous to those given above for three-dimensional space.

For a further generalization to manifolds, see the discussion of Hodge decomposition below.

== Differential forms ==
The Hodge decomposition is closely related to the Helmholtz decomposition, generalizing from vector fields on R3 to differential forms on a Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot;. Most formulations of the Hodge decomposition require &quot;M&quot; to be compact. Since this is not true of R3, the Hodge decomposition theorem is not strictly a generalization of the Helmholtz theorem. However, the compactness restriction in the usual formulation of the Hodge decomposition can be replaced by suitable decay assumptions at infinity on the differential forms involved, giving a proper generalization of the Helmholtz theorem.

== Extensions to fields not decaying at infinity ==

Most textbooks only deal with vector fields decaying faster than formula_89 with formula_133 at infinity. However, Otto Blumenthal showed in 1905 that an adapted integration kernel can be used to integrate fields decaying faster than formula_89 with formula_135, which is substantially less strict.
To achieve this, the kernel formula_93 in the convolution integrals has to be replaced by formula_137.
With even more complex integration kernels, solutions can be found even for divergent functions that need not grow faster than polynomial.

For all analytic vector fields that need not go to zero even at infinity, methods based on partial integration and the Cauchy formula for repeated integration can be used to compute closed-form solutions of the rotation and scalar potentials, as in the case of multivariate polynomial, sine, cosine, and exponential functions.

== Uniqueness of the solution ==

In general, the Helmholtz decomposition is not uniquely defined.
A harmonic function formula_138 is a function that satisfies formula_139.
By adding formula_138 to the scalar potential formula_141, a different Helmholtz decomposition can be obtained:

formula_142

For vector fields formula_14, decaying at infinity, it is a plausible choice that scalar and rotation potentials also decay at infinity. 
Because formula_144 is the only harmonic function with this property, which follows from Liouville&#x27;s theorem, this guarantees the uniqueness of the gradient and rotation fields.

This uniqueness does not apply to the potentials: In the three-dimensional case, the scalar and vector potential jointly have four components, whereas the vector field has only three. The vector field is invariant to gauge transformations and the choice of appropriate potentials known as gauge fixing is the subject of gauge theory. Important examples from physics are the Lorenz gauge condition and the Coulomb gauge. An alternative is to use the poloidal–toroidal decomposition.

== Applications ==
=== Electrodynamics ===

The Helmholtz theorem is of particular interest in electrodynamics, since it can be used to write Maxwell&#x27;s equations in the potential image and solve them more easily. The Helmholtz decomposition can be used to prove that, given electric current density and charge density, the electric field and the magnetic flux density can be determined. They are unique if the densities vanish at infinity and one assumes the same for the potentials.

=== Fluid dynamics ===

In fluid dynamics, the Helmholtz projection plays an important role, especially for the solvability theory of the Navier-Stokes equations. If the Helmholtz projection is applied to the linearized incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the Stokes equation is obtained. This depends only on the velocity of the particles in the flow, but no longer on the static pressure, allowing the equation to be reduced to one unknown. However, both equations, the Stokes and linearized equations, are equivalent. The operator formula_145 is called the Stokes operator.

=== Dynamical systems theory ===

In the theory of dynamical systems, Helmholtz decomposition can be used to determine &quot;quasipotentials&quot; as well as to compute Lyapunov functions in some cases.

For some dynamical systems such as the Lorenz system (Edward N. Lorenz, 1963), a simplified model for atmospheric convection, a closed-form expression of the Helmholtz decomposition can be obtained:
formula_146
The Helmholtz decomposition of formula_147, with the scalar potential formula_148 is given as:

formula_149
formula_150

The quadratic scalar potential provides motion in the direction of the coordinate origin, which is responsible for the stable fix point for some parameter range. For other parameters, the rotation field ensures that a strange attractor is created, causing the model to exhibit a butterfly effect.

=== Medical Imaging ===

In magnetic resonance elastography, a variant of MR imaging where mechanical waves are used to probe the viscoelasticity of organs, the Helmholtz decomposition is sometimes used to separate the measured displacement fields into its shear component (divergence-free) and its compression component (curl-free). In this way, the complex shear modulus can be calculated without contributions from compression waves.

=== Computer animation and robotics ===

The Helmholtz decomposition is also used in the field of computer engineering. This includes robotics, image reconstruction but also computer animation, where the decomposition is used for realistic visualization of fluids or vector fields.

<text>The Island Corridor, previously the Esquimalt &amp; Nanaimo Railway (E&amp;N Railway), is a railway operation on Vancouver Island. It is owned by the Island Corridor Foundation, a registered charity. The railway line is in length from Victoria to Courtenay, known as the Victoria Subdivision, with a branch line from Parksville to Port Alberni, known as the Port Alberni Subdivision, of , for a total of mainline track. In 2006, the Island Corridor Foundation acquired the railway&#x27;s ownership from RailAmerica and Canadian Pacific Railway.

Passenger service has been &quot;temporarily suspended&quot; since 2011 due to poor infrastructure condition that resulted from deferred maintenance.

==History==

===Vancouver Island joining Canada===
The history of an island railway and a functioning island railway in perpetuity started with the colony of Vancouver Island joining British Columbia in 1866, Canadian Confederation in 1867, and the incorporation of British Columbia (BC) into Canada in 1871. The terms of union required that, within two years, the federal government was to start the construction of a railway from the &quot;seaboard of British Columbia&quot;, joining the new province and Victoria with the railway system of Canada. On its part, British Columbia was to grant a band of public land of up to in width along either side of the railway line to the federal government for it to use in furtherance of the construction of the railway. The Pacific terminus of the railway was not specified, but the proposed plan would have the railway cross the Rockies by the Yellowhead Pass and reach the BC coast at Bute Inlet. It would cross Sonora Island and Quadra Island and reach Vancouver Island by a bridge across Seymour Narrows. Through the influence of then BC Premier Amor de Cosmos, this plan was adopted by Order in Council by the federal government on 7 June 1873. Two shipments of rail were even delivered to Victoria from the United Kingdom. In 1873, Prime Minister of Canada John A. Macdonald had stated that Esquimalt, the site of a naval base, would be the terminus of the &quot;Pacific Railway&quot;. However, both the federal government and the Canadian Pacific Railway placed a low priority on construction of an island railway, as it had low traffic potential and would duplicate an existing steamer service.
In 1874, British Columbia threatened to withdraw from Confederation, and BC premier Walkem petitioned Queen Victoria for relief from these delays. Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie and Walkem agreed to accept arbitration of the dispute by the Earl of Carnarvon, the colonial secretary. His award, given 17 November 1874, gave an extension of time for the construction and required that a railway be built from Esquimalt to Nanaimo. Despite the promises of both parties to be bound by his ruling, the federal government bill approving the award failed in the Canadian Senate. British Columbians were indignant, and withdrawal from Confederation was raised again.

John A. Macdonald gave a speech in 1881 in the House of Commons on the CPR and criticized Alexander Mackenzie for tinkering with the preconditions of British Columbia and Vancouver Island uniting with Canada. MacDonald said, &quot;Both the Government of which I was the head and the Government of which he was the head were bound by the original resolutions.&quot; He continued, &quot;It was admitted that it was a sacred obligation; it was admitted that there was a treaty made with British Columbia, with the people and the Government of British Columbia, and not only was it an agreement and a solemn bargain made between Canada and British Columbia, but it was formally sanctioned by Her Majesty&#x27;s Government. It was a matter of Colonial policy and Imperial policy in England that the road should be constructed.&quot;

===Land grants===

====Coal Baron Robert Dunsmuir====
Robert Dunsmuir, the Nanaimo coal baron and a member of the provincial legislature, was interested in owning the railway project and in the province&#x27;s coal reserves. The fact that Dunsmuir was a member of the provincial government making the deal aroused some suspicion about corruption. Dunsmuir and three partners (Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington and Leland Stanford of California) incorporated the Esquimalt &amp; Nanaimo Railway (less formally the E&amp;N Railway), with Dunsmuir president and owner of one half of the shares. The company estimated that it would cost $1.5 million to construct. Dunsmuir planned to integrate the railway with the systems being built in Washington and Oregon, with a train ferry link from Victoria.

MacDonald gave British Columbia the choice of Dunsmuir or Lewis M. Clement of San Francisco, chief engineer of the Western Division of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, for the contract. Dunsmuir travelled to Ottawa in 1882 with letters of introduction from John Hamilton Gray, one of the Fathers of Confederation, and Joseph Trutch, the first lieutenant governor of British Columbia, both men in favour with Macdonald. After a visit to Ottawa to present himself directly for this project, Dunsmuir went off to Scotland. While in Scotland, Dunsmuir received the news that the provincial government had chosen the Vancouver Land and Railway Company controlled by Clement for the job. Dunsmuir was surprised that Clement would take the contract without a cash grant in addition to the land and commit to building the railway to Seymour Narrows, near Campbell River. When Clement and his company failed to come up with the necessary financial security, Macdonald quickly moved to accept Dunsmuir&#x27;s terms.

==== Settler rights ====
The court ruled that this grant did not entitle the railway to dispossess existing settlers. The company applied for compensation and received a further grant of between Crown Mountain and Seymour Narrows. In 1883, the British Columbia government signed a contract with Dunsmuir to build a railway between Esquimalt and Nanaimo in exchange for the same grant of land that Clement had negotiated, amounting to , plus a cash grant of $750,000 from the federal government. Based on an average value of $10 per acre for the land the E&amp;N received, it cost the government $626,660 per mile to build the railway, which when complete was in private hands. The railway was given a massive amount of old-growth forest. Proceeds from the land grants helped build Craigdarroch Castle. The grant amounted to almost 10 percent of Vancouver Island and included mineral rights and all known coal deposits. The land grants to the E&amp;N railway from 1884 to 1925 amounted to 20 percent of Vancouver Island. The company was to receive a grant with the following boundaries (Muir Creek is about west of Sooke):
:On the south by a straight line drawn from the head of Saanich Inlet to Muir Creek, on the Straits of Fuca:
:On the west, by a straight line drawn from Muir Creek, aforesaid, to Crown Mountain:
:On the north, by a straight line drawn from Crown Mountain to Seymour Narrows: and
:On the east, by the coast line of Vancouver Island to the point of commencement.
The grant was facilitated by BC&#x27;s introduction of the &quot;Settlement Act&quot; in December 1883, in which surface rights of existing &quot;squatters&quot; were acknowledged and protected.

===Construction===
The last spike was gold and the hammer was silver. On 13 August 1886, the last spike was driven at Cliffside, Shawnigan Lake, about north of Victoria. Construction of the island railway took three and a half years. Prime Minister Macdonald drove the last spike, during his only visit to British Columbia. The railway was extended to Dunsmuir&#x27;s mine at Wellington in 1887, and into Victoria in 1888. It was extended west to Port Alberni in 1911, west to Lake Cowichan in 1912, and north to Courtenay in 1914. The E&amp;N Railway was to have been built all the way to Campbell River, but that plan fell through due to the outbreak of World War I.

The present-day bridge, north of Victoria, over Niagara Creek Canyon () previously crossed the Fraser River at Cisco, British Columbia and was moved to Niagara Creek Canyon circa 1910. The cantilever suspension bridge was pre-fabricated in England in 1883 and shipped to Canada. It replaced the original wooden trestle bridge, which was damaged in a washout on 12 November 1886.

===CPR years===
In 1905, Robert Dunsmuir&#x27;s son, James Dunsmuirformer BC premier and soon-to-be lieutenant governor) sold the E&amp;N Railway to the Canadian Pacific Railway. The CPR built the railroad to Lake Cowichan, Port Alberni, Parksville, Qualicum Beach, and Courtenay. At its peak, the railroad had 45 stations on the main line, 3 stations on the Cowichan line, and 8 stations on the Port Alberni line.

Between 1905 and 1999, the E&amp;N Railway was owned and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Via Rail took over operation of CPR&#x27;s passenger train service, called &quot;The Malahat&quot;, in 1978 when CPR demarketed its freight operation, claiming that freight traffic was declining. In 1996, CPR reorganized the E&amp;N as an &quot;internal short line&quot; named E&amp;N Railfreight while the railbarge operations were sold to Seaspan Intermodal. In early 1999, shortline operator RailAmerica purchased the route from Nanaimo to Port Alberni, and leased the balance of the line. At that time, approximately 8,500 carloads of forest and paper products, minerals, and chemicals were transported by the Southern Vancouver Island Railway each year.

===RailAmerica===

In 1998, CPR sold the middle part of the corridor to RailAmerica. Despite the purchase by RailAmerica, freight traffic continued to decline and the future of the E&amp;N was still in doubt. RailAmerica sought a sale for its acquisition due to unprofitability and deferred maintenance issues. Restrictions from Canadian Pacific on the lease/sale agreement, and major reconstruction of Highway 1 from Victoria to Nanaimo and the new freeway from Nanaimo to Campbell River, led to reduced driving times for the full length of the E&amp;N. This development also affected the privately owned rail line, which did not have the benefit of the provincial subsidies accorded to its competing highways. Freight traffic dropped to about 2,000 carloads a year after the loss of their largest freight customer, a Catalyst Paper pulp mill in Port Alberni. RailAmerica ceased to operate the E&amp;N on 30 June 2006, with the Washington Group&#x27;s Southern Railway of British Columbia taking over operations the following day.

===VIA Rail===
In 1978, VIA Rail assumed operational responsibility for the E&amp;N Railway passenger service. Post ICF ownership, the rail operator agreement had the private company Southern Railway operate the daily inter-city passenger service from Victoria to Courtenay on behalf of VIA Rail. Train tickets had to be purchased three days in advance to avoid an increase in the cost of the fare. In 2011, due to the disrepair of the railway, VIA Rail and Southern Railway suspended the Dayliner passenger service, the Victoria–Courtenay train indefinitely. The train had scheduled stops at Duncan, Nanaimo, and Parksville, with many other flag stops (stops on request) along the way. VIA and Southern Railway did offer a bus service for several months after the closure, but the service was discontinued August 7, 2011. VIA&#x27;s bus tickets had to be bought three days in advance and fewer than ten people a day used their temporary bus service. The VIA passenger service used Budd-built Rail Diesel Cars (Dayliners). Those rail cars are no longer on Vancouver Island, and at least one is now owned by Rapido Trains, a model railroad company.

=== Names ===
Until 1996, it was called the Esquimalt &amp; Nanaimo Railway (which it is still called by people living on the Island). It then spent three years as E&amp;N Railfreight, an internal short line within then owner Canadian Pacific Railway. Operations were then sold to RailAmerica. The RailAmerica subsidiary was named E&amp;N Railway Co (1998) Ltd. , thus maintaining the historic name associations for the Vancouver Island line. Currently, the right of way and rail line is owned by the Island Corridor Foundation and operated under contract by Southern Railway of British Columbia, a part of the Washington Companies.

==Island Corridor Foundation==
===Tax gift===
The not for profit Island Corridor Foundation is a partnership between the Cowichan Tribes and local governments along the rail line. After years of work and negotiations, the ICF came to agreements with the Canadian Pacific Railway and with RailAmerica to hand over its Island rail assets to the foundation for tax credits.

In February 2006, the Canadian Pacific Railway donated its portion of the railway right-of-way, which averages in width between Victoria and Courtenay, to the Island Corridor Foundation. The donation tax credit exchange was estimated to be valued at Cdn$236 million and encompasses of land, six historic railway stations and a number of trestles. In addition, CPR also supplied $2.3 million in &quot;seed money&quot; to the Foundation. Lands were also given that produce non-rail revenue generated by property leases and encroachments on the line.

On 22 March 2006, RailAmerica donated ownership of the Port Alberni to Nanaimo portion of the railway to the Island Corridor Foundation.

=== No trespassing policy ===
More people are starting to walk, hike and use off-road vehicles on the right of way. Railway and ICF officials are asking people to stay off the tracks for their own safety.

=== Freight ===

ICF chose Southern Railway of British Columbia (SRY) to operate the Island railway on Vancouver Island, after ICF&#x27;s acquisition of the railroad. The operator agreement started on July 1, 2006. In January 2010, the Southern Railway of British Columbia new train ferry terminal started operating in the Fraser River on Annacis Island shipping to Nanaimo via the Seaspan train ferry. The new train marine terminal was built with the help of $4.6 million in federal funding and cost $11 million. It increases the mainland&#x27;s capacity and speed to load and unload railcar barges from the island.

The amount of freight traffic in 2008 and 2009 was about 1,000 cars per year. According to the Rule of 100, a generally accepted economic formula for short-line railways, a minimum of 100 freight cars per mile a year is required before a line is profitable due to depreciation accounting. The old E&amp;N route averages about 6.6 cars per mile. The ICF has estimated there is a potential business of 22,000 rail cars of freight each year on Vancouver Island.

An ICF development strategies report estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 carloads per year, as the amount of business that would be required to bear the full capital cost of upgrading the railroad and maintain operations on a sustainable basis. If the capital costs of upgrading the railway are excluded, the business of 8,000 carloads per year would be required to pay for basic operating and maintenance costs. The most significant potential revenue is the Raven coal mine (west of Fanny Bay) needing up to 10,000 carloads per year. The foundation report noted the market potential for sourcing of aggregates like gravel for the Victoria market from alternative reserves up-Island. However, this market would be extremely competitive due to the availability of shipments of aggregate by barge from the Lehigh Materials (part of Lehigh Hanson) facility in Sechelt and the new Johnson Street Bridge providing barge access to downtown Victoria.

In November 2014, SRY freight service along much of the Duncan-to-Parksville segment of the line was suspended following a risk assessment after the disrepair of the track had been continuously slowing train speeds down. No timeline was known for when service will resume.

As of 2018, the only regularly operated track left is a truncated 10-mile section in the Nanaimo area, from Welcox Yard at the waterfront to Wellington siding, to serve the Superior Propane spur in north Nanaimo. In addition, some customers have their goods transloaded to trucks within Welcox Yard.

The ICF is a partnership of the various local governments and First Nations communities along the railway, including 14 municipalities, 5 regional districts and 12 First Nations.

==Railway dormancy and delayed re-openings==

Beginning March 18, 2011 passenger service between Victoria and Courtenay was &quot;temporarily suspended,&quot; due to safety concerns about the poor condition of the tracks. In April 2012 the Federal Government announced that it would match a $7.5 million grant offered by the BC Provincial Government, providing the required $15 million for basic repairs and upgrades to reopen the rail line. The line was expected to reopen, and rail services re-commence in 2013, as early as the spring, but was delayed due to failed negotiations between the Island Corridor Foundation and VIA Rail. In July 2014, an agreement was signed by VIA Rail to resume operations with plans to have services resume in the summer of 2015, but in April 2015, the ICF stated that the resumption of service has been put on hold while the BC Ministry of Transportation and provincial government review the funds for covering repair costs. Scheduled passenger service has yet to resume.

== Vancouver Island Transportation Corridor Coalition ==
A non-profit society, the Vancouver Island Transportation Corridor Coalition (VITCC), announced formation on July 7, 2020, to facilitate the return of rail service to Vancouver Island. The VITCC mandate is to promote modernizing the former E&amp;N rail corridor as the backbone of the Island&#x27;s future transportation system for commuters and freight alike, integrating with all other forms of transportation. They also seek to expand the cycling and pedestrian trails alongside the railway from the current more than 100 kilometres.

==Bike path beside E&amp;N in Victoria and Nanaimo==
A bike path named the E&amp;N Rail Trail has been built beside the E&amp;N tracks from Vic West to Langford. In April 2007 the Island Corridor Foundation agreed to lease its land in Greater Victoria to the Capital Regional District (CRD) for development of the bike trail. Construction began in 2009, and as of August 2021 there is approximately 3.6 km left to build to reach Humpback Road, the currently planned western end of the CRD built trail.

In Nanaimo an trail was built in the 1990s. The E&amp;N Trail is a multi-purpose paved trail for cycling, walking, roller blading and wheelchairs. It stretches from Townsite Road in the south to Mostar in the north where it connects to the Parkway Trail.

In the fall of 2013 a partnership of various community groups interested in moving the E&amp;N Rail Trail forward was formed and the Nanaimo Regional Rail Trail Partnership was born. The NRRTP comprises the Downtown Business Improvement Association (DNBIA), Tourism Nanaimo, Regional District of Nanaimo (RDN), the City of Nanaimo, Greater Nanaimo Cycling Coalition (GNCC), and the Island Corridor Foundation (ICF). As of 2015 the group has raised funds and is building the E&amp;N extension trail from the old Nanaimo train station to 7th Avenue in the south. It planned to have that multi-use trail finished by 2019.

Concurrently, north of Nanaimo, the Regional District of Nanaimo started with two new sections in 2018. The first sections of trail will total approximately and will connect the City of Parksville with Coombs and French Creek.

==Rapid transit on E&amp;N in Victoria==
In 1996 a BC Transit report proposed renewing the track and enhancing road crossings, to travel 13.3 km (8.3 miles) to arrive over the bridge into downtown Victoria from Station Avenue, Langford. The travel time was 24 minutes, using the existing track, including stops, and restricting the speed to 25 km/h (16 mph) due to the condition of the railway and street crossings.

In 2008, a report by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure put the travel time at 36 minutes, using the existing track, and having a train travelling a further distance of 17.2 km (10.7 mi) from West Langford. This includes six stops and stopping at each station for half a minute. The speed varies from 8 to 65 km/h (5 to 40 mph).

<text>Hans Rām Singh Rawat, called Shrī Hans Jī Mahārāj and by various other honorifics (8 November 1900 – 19 July 1966), was an Indian religious leader.

He was born in Gadh-ki-Sedhia, north-east of Haridwar in present-day Uttarakhand, India. His parents were Ranjit Singh Rawat and Kalindi Devi. He was considered a Satguru by his students who called him affectionately &quot;Shri Maharaj ji&quot; or just &quot;Guru Maharaj ji.&quot;

He had a daughter from his first wife Sinduri Devi, and four sons from his second wife Rajeshwari Devi, later known among followers as &quot;Mata Ji&quot; and &quot;Shri Mata Ji&quot;.
==Life and work==

At the age of eight, not long after starting at the village school, Hans Rām&#x27;s mother died. From that time he was raised by his aunt. As a young adult he visited many holy men in the nearby mountains and pilgrimage towns in the area now the Pakistani provinces of Sindh, Baluchistan and Punjab. He was reportedly disenchanted with these and turned to the Arya Samaj, a popular movement formed to remove caste prejudices and idolatry from Hinduism.

The search for work led Hans to Lahore, the capital of the former Sikh kingdom. During this time he made his first contact with Swami Swarupanand, a guru in the lineage of Advait Mat, from Guna. In 1923, Swami Swarupanand taught Hans the techniques of Knowledge or kriyas, an experience of which Hans later said: &quot;I was given no mantra, but experienced Knowledge. I experienced the music and light of my heart. My mind was focused within&quot;. Three years later, in 1926, Swami Swarupanand asked him to start teaching others the techniques of Knowledge, and for the subsequent 10 years Hans traveled through what is today Pakistan and northern India. A strong bond of teacher/disciple was formed between them which Swami Swarupanand reportedly referred to as follows: &quot;I am in Hans&#x27; heart and Hans is in my heart&quot;.

In 1936, Swami Swarupanand took mahasamadhi in Nangli Sahib, a village near the north town of Meerut. Reported indications from Swami Swarupanand about Hans&#x27; succession were later contested by a group of mahatmas who noted that Hans had married Sinduri Devi from a neighboring village in the district of Garwal, making him a &quot;householder&quot;, a status that in their view as renunciates was not acceptable. After the rift, Hans was left with only a handful of people to help him continue his work. Hans branched out on his own with the understanding that he had his teacher&#x27;s blessings, and continued teaching throughout the Indian sub-continent.

That same year, he started presenting his message and teaching in the small town of Najibabad, near Haridwar. His talks at the time were strongly influenced by the egalitarian and reformist philosophy of the Arya Samaj, and he reportedly accepted anyone as his student, irrespective of caste, religion or status. This was an unusual stance for an Indian teacher, and it drew its share of criticism from traditional Hindus. During this year he published a book &quot;Hans Yog Prakash&quot; as a first step to broadening the dissemination of his message.

During the next years, Hans traveled by foot and by train to towns and villages across north India, speaking at small, impromptu gatherings at train stations, or under a tree in the village grounds. By the late 1930s, Hans had begun visiting Delhi, teaching workers at the Delhi Cloth Mills. He traveled constantly between Haridwar and Delhi, often staying at followers&#x27; houses at Paharganj and Connaught Place, behind the new Delhi center.

In 1944, as the number of students grew, Hans purchased a small, two-floor house on the bank of the Ganges canal outside Haridwar, and named it &quot;Prem Nagar&quot; (&quot;Town of Love&quot;). The mahatmas who were helping him in a full-time capacity lived there with him in the tradition of the gurukul. Four years later, he reportedly purchased his first car, a green Austin Somerset, that assisted him in visiting nearby towns and villages in his effort to reach more people.

Hans and his first wife, Sinduri Devi, had a daughter, Savitri, but after that Sinduri Devi was unable to have more children. As a consequence of that, and based on an understanding that Swarupanand reportedly had told him that &quot;one day he [Hans] will have a son who would play an important role&quot;, he took a second wife in Rajeshwari Devi in 1946. Unlike his first wife, Rajeshwari Devi would in time become known as Mata Ji and play a prominent role in her husband&#x27;s work. In 1951, their first son was born (Satpāl), followed by three more in 1953 (Mahi Pāl), 1955 (Dharam Pāl), and 1957 (Prem Pāl), affectionately nicknamed &quot;Sant Jī&quot; by Hans.

As Hans Rām&#x27;s message was spreading throughout northern India, several initiatives were taken to facilitate his work, including the publishing of a monthly magazine named &quot;Hansadesh&quot; in 1951, and the formation of the Divine Light Mission (DLM). For nearly 30 years Hans disseminated his message without any formal organisation. After resisting suggestions for such an organisation, he finally gave in to growing pressure, and the Divine Light Mission was registered in Patna in 1960, to develop and structure the growing activities across India. The mission aims discussed are that &quot;in principle all religions are one&quot; and that the understanding that &quot;peace is indivisible&quot; and achievable by individuals and that &quot;disgruntled individuals and dissatisfied nations can never promote lasting peace in the world.&quot; It also discusses some humanitarian initiatives.

By the early 1960s there were students in most large cities, towns and villages in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan, as well as within the Indian communities in South Africa. Meetings were still small, and Hans&#x27; close relationship with his students continued. In 1963, the first of many large public programs was held in the Ram Lila grounds in New Delhi, reportedly attended by 15,000. In 1964, an event took place on Gandhi Maidan in the heart of old Delhi that attracted even larger crowds. Several ashrams were opened during that time, including a small one in Rajasthan and another larger one called &quot;Satlok&quot; (&quot;Place of Truth&quot;) located between Delhi and Haridwar.

In 1965, Hans attended a religious conference in New Delhi&#x27;s Constitution Club that was chaired by the then Speaker of the India Parliament, Mr. Ayengar. That year Hans flew for the first time when he visited his students in Jammu, Kashmir.

On 18 July 1966, while visiting a small ashram in Alwar, Hans fell ill, and the same day returned to Delhi by car. It is reported that he died at 3 a.m. the following morning. Three days later, in a procession led by his family and many grieving mahatmas, his ashes were taken to his home in Haridwar.

==Succession==

During the customary 13 days of mourning following Hans&#x27;s death, the succession was discussed by DLM officials. The youngest son, 8-year-old Prem Rawat, addressed the crowd and was accepted by them, as well as by his mother and brothers, as the &quot;Perfect Master&quot;. Though Prem Rawat was officially the leader of the DLM, because of his young age authority was shared by the whole family.

For the next eight years Hans&#x27;s family supported Prem Rawat as his successor but the latter&#x27;s decision to marry a Westerner in 1974 precipitated a struggle for control of DLM. Mata Ji returned to India and appointed her oldest son Satpal as the new head of DLM India claiming that Prem Rawat had broken his spiritual discipline by marrying and becoming a &quot;playboy&quot;. The Western &quot;premies&quot; remained loyal to Prem Rawat but the marriage led to a permanent rift within the family and was also credited with causing a profound disruption in the movement.

Satpal became the new head of the organisation in India and later also became a prominent INC politician, being elected to the 11th and 15th Lok Sabha; he is considered a satguru by his followers.

<text>William Albert Stanley Oldfield (9 September 1894 – 10 August 1976) was an Australian cricketer and businessman. He played for New South Wales and Australia as a wicket-keeper. Oldfield&#x27;s 52 stumpings during his Test career remains a record several decades after his final Test.

==Life and career==
Oldfield was born in Alexandria, a suburb of Sydney, the seventh child of John William Oldfield, an upholsterer born in Manchester and his Australian wife Mary Gregory. During World War I, Oldfield served with the army in the first Australian Imperial Force as a Corporal in the 15th Field Ambulance. He was wounded and knocked unconscious at Ypres Salient in 1917, and spent six months recovering from shell shock. At the conclusion of the war he was selected to be part of the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team which played 28 first-class matches in Britain, South Africa and Australia between May 1919 and February 1920.

Oldfield made his first-class debut in England in 1919, and played his first Test match against England in his hometown of Sydney in the 1920–21 season. In 1921, it was reported that he entered into negotiations to play for Lancashire as an amateur. He had injured himself on the passage to the UK in 1921, giving Carter the chance to restore his position, although Oldfield replaced him for the last two Tests. He was dropped for several matches over the next few years, but established himself as Australia&#x27;s automatic selection for wicket-keeper in the 1924–25 Ashes series against England.

He missed only one other Test in his career, the fourth Test of the 1932–33 Bodyline series. In the notorious third Test at Adelaide, the English Bodyline tactic of bowling fast balls directed at the Australian batsmen&#x27;s bodies reached its most dramatic moment when a ball from fast bowler Harold Larwood hit Oldfield in the head, fracturing his skull (although this was from a top edge off a traditional non-Bodyline ball and Oldfield admitted it was his fault). Oldfield was carried from the ground unconscious. He recovered in time for the fifth Test of the series. Always an easy-going personality, Oldfield immediately forgave Larwood for the incident, and the two eventually became firm friends when Larwood later emigrated to Australia.
Oldfield played Test cricket for four more years, ending his career in 1937. He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1927.

Oldfield played 54 Tests for Australia, scoring 1,427 runs at an average of 22.65, and taking 78 catches and 52 stumpings. His tally of 52 stumpings remains a Test career world record; 28 were off Clarrie Grimmett alone. In first-class cricket he played 245 matches, scoring 6,135 runs at an average of 23.77, and taking 399 catches and 263 stumpings.

After retiring from cricket he coached, taking several schoolboys teams on overseas tours. In 1964, he spent a month coaching cricketers in Ethiopia, and met Haile Selassie. He was awarded an MBE in 1970.

In 1988 a public school in Seven Hills, New South Wales was renamed as Bert Oldfield Public School to commemorate his life. A cricket oval in the Sydney suburb of Killara, where he lived later in life, is named in Oldfield&#x27;s honour.

<doc id="820289" wikidata="Q1156234" url="?curid=820289" title="London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter">
<text>The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 1972, commonly called the &quot;London Convention&quot; or &quot;LC &#x27;72&quot; and also abbreviated as Marine Dumping, is an agreement to control pollution of the sea by dumping and to encourage regional agreements supplementary to the convention. It covers the deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, and platforms. It does not cover discharges from land-based sources such as pipes and outfalls, wastes generated incidental to normal operation of vessels, or placement of materials for purposes other than mere disposal, providing such disposal is not contrary to aims of the convention. It entered into force in 1975. As of September 2016, there were 89 Parties to the convention.

==Background==
The convention was called for by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (June 1972, Stockholm), the treaty was drafted at the Intergovernmental Conference on the Convention on the Dumping of Wastes at Sea (13 November 1972, London) and it was opened for signature on 29 December 1972. It entered into force on 30 August 1975 when 15 nations ratified. As of 1 October 2001, there were 78 Contracting Parties to the convention. International Administration of the Convention functions through Consultative Meetings held at International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London.

The London Convention consists of 22 Articles and three Annexes. It follows a &quot;black list/grey list&quot; approach to regulating ocean dumping; Annex I materials (black list) generally may not be ocean dumped (though for certain Annex I materials dumping may be permissible if present only as &quot;trace contaminants&quot; or &quot;rapidly rendered harmless&quot; and Annex II materials (grey list) require &quot;special care&quot;. Annex III lays out general technical factors to be considered in establishing criteria for issuance of ocean dumping permits.

The main objective of the London Convention is to prevent indiscriminate disposal at sea of wastes that could be liable for creating hazards to human health; harming living resources and marine life; damaging amenities; or interfering with other legitimate uses of the sea. The 1972 Convention extends its scope over &quot;all marine waters other than the internal waters&quot; of the States and prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials. It further requires a prior special permit for the dumping of a number of other identified materials and a prior general permit for other wastes or matter.

==Implementation==

Since its entering into force in 1975, the convention has provided a framework for international control and prevention of marine pollution within which the contracting parties have achieved continuous progress in keeping the oceans clean. Among its milestones are the 1993 ban on ocean disposal of low-level radioactive wastes and the resolutions to end the dumping and incineration of industrial wastes. The efforts of the Parties are supported by a permanent secretariat hosted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The consultative meeting of the contracting parties to the London convention is the governing and political decision-making body of the convention. It takes advice on issues needing multidisciplinary expertise from the Joint Group of Experts on Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) which is composed of specialised experts nominated by the IMO, FAO, UNESCO, IOC, WMO, WHO, IAEA, UN, and UNEP. A scientific group on dumping, composed of government experts from the parties to the convention a responsible to address any scientific requests from the consultative meeting, including the preparation of lists of hazardous substances, developing guide-lines on the implementation of the convention, and maintaining awareness of the impacts on the marine environments of inputs from all waste sources.

The convention is implemented in the United States through Title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) which directs that implementing regulations are to apply binding requirements of LC to the extent that this would not relax the MPRSA.

===1996 Protocol===
On 17 November 1996, a special meeting of the Contracting Parties adopted the &quot;1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972&quot; which is to replace the 1972 Convention, subject to ratification. In line with UNCED&#x27;s Agenda 21, the 1996 Protocol reflects the global trend towards precaution and prevention with the parties agreeing to move from controlled dispersal at sea of a variety of land-generated wastes towards integrated land-based solutions for most, and controlled sea disposal of few, remaining categories of wastes or other matter.

Among the most important innovations brought by the 1996 protocol is the codification of the &quot;precautionary approach&quot; and the &quot;polluter pays principle.&quot; Reflecting these principles, the protocol embodies a major structural revision of the convention the so-called &quot;reverse list&quot; approach. Now, instead of prohibiting the dumping of certain (listed) hazardous materials, the parties are obligated to prohibit the dumping of any waste or other matter that is not listed in Annex 1 (&quot;the reverse list&quot;) of the 1996 protocol. Dumping of wastes or other matter on this reverse list requires a permit. Parties to the protocol are further obligated to adopt measures to ensure that the issuance of permits and permit conditions for the dumping of reverse list substances comply with Annex 2 (the Waste Assessment Annex) of the protocol. The substances on the reverse list include dredged material; sewage sludge; industrial fish processing waste; vessels and offshore platforms or other man-made structures at sea; inert, inorganic geological material; organic material of natural origin; and bulky items including iron, steel, concrete and similar materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations with no land-disposal alternatives. In addition, the 1996 protocol prohibits altogether the practice of incineration at sea, except for emergencies, and prohibits the exports of wastes or other matter to non-Parties for the purpose of dumping or incineration at sea.

The 1996 protocol has effectively moved the scope of the original London convention landwards, relating it to the policy and management issues of land as well as sea wastes disposal. Indicative for this shift are such elements as the codification of the precautionary approach and the establishment of requirements such as the &quot;waste prevention audit,&quot; the identification and control of the sources of contamination for certain materials, and the collaboration with relevant local and national agencies that are involved in point and non-point source pollution control. In this context, integrated coastal management (ICM) comes as a natural framework for effective implementation of the objectives of the protocol. Relaying on its vast ICM technical expertise, the National Ocean Service (NOS) is to contribute to the creation of the necessary foundation for the US accession to the 1996 Protocol and, further on, to the protocol&#x27;s implementation. Through its International Program Office, NOS would also contribute to the international co-operation efforts towards meeting the objectives of the 1996 Protocol.

The legal interpretation about carbon capture and storage (CCS) is uncertain. The sub-seabed wastes fall within the scope of the treaty, which can prohibit CCS projects like the injection of CO2 into offshore platforms built into sub-seabed geological formations.

==Parties==

&quot;State parties&quot; – (87 as of 2013) Afghanistan, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belarus (ratified as Byelorussian SSR), Belgium, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cape Verde, Chile, People&#x27;s Republic of China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan (ratified but w/ exclusion), Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, South Korea, Libya, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Nauru, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia (ratified as the Soviet Union), Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Serbia (ratified as Serbia and Montenegro), Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tunisia, Ukraine (ratified as Ukrainian SSR), United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vanuatu. (Insert Reference).

==Cases==
Japan&#x27;s 2023 release of water from a damaged nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean raised questions for the Governing Bodies of the London Convention (LC) and its Protocol (LP) and the Fukushima District Court as to whether the action constituted dumping under Article 4. In 2021 the Governing Bodies received concerns about the release from Greenpeace International, South Korea, as well as Japan asking whether the prohibition to dump radioactive materials from &quot;man-made structures at sea&quot; bans discharges from land-based pipelines protruding into the sea. The London Convention Secretariat explained on 29 July 2022 that &quot;man-made structures at sea&quot; is not currently defined by treaties, but interpretations including those based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea seem to exclude pipelines as land-based. On the other hand, the Legal Affairs Office of the International Maritime Organization said that parties to the LC/LP could decide whether protruding pipelines count as &quot;other man-made structures at sea&quot;. This allows a teleological interpretation of the convention such that the goal of protecting the marine environment determines what is allowed or prohibited, even if the specific polluting pathway may vary.

<text>The United Reformed Churches in North America (URCNA) is a theologically conservative federation of Reformed churches founded in 1996. Many churches joined the URCNA after splitting from the Christian Reformed Church in North America denomination.

== Origin ==
The URCNA has grown from the earlier Protestant movements in Europe of the 16th and 17th century, and also from Reformed churches in Belgium and the Netherlands. Like other churches in the Reformed tradition, it traces its interpretation of Scripture back to the sixteenth-century Reformer, John Calvin. Although Calvinism took root in many countries in Europe, it took especial hold in the Netherlands. Dutch immigrants to North America carried their beliefs with them over the subsequent centuries. Rather than joining existing churches of other denominations in North America, these Dutch immigrants started their own churches, churches that became known as the Christian Reformed Church in North America. Over the twentieth century, the Christian Reformed Church grew progressively more liberal. Conservative reformed believers were generally concerned that the Christian Reformed Churches were departing from Scriptural teaching to accommodate modern social trends. Specific disagreements arose on issues like women&#x27;s ordination, evolution cases, and biblical inerrancy.

In 1996, the URCNA was founded as a federation of Reformed churches in 1996 at Lynwood, Illinois CRC. Most of the members that founded the URCNA left the Christian Reformed Church, although members of other Reformed denominations quickly joined the new federation. Some 36 churches with 7,600 members joined the federative unity, held their first Synod, and adopted the name United Reformed Churches in North America.

== Beliefs ==
The URCNA subscribes to three confessions of faith: the Canons of Dordt, written in 1618 and 1619 by an international group of Reformed churches, the Belgic Confession, written by Guido de Bres in the mid-1500s, and the Heidelberg Catechism, formally attributed to Zacharias Ursinus and Caspar Olevianus in the city of Heidelberg, Germany. Collectively, these statements of faith are called the &quot;Three Forms of Unity.&quot; In addition to these forms, the URCNA holds to the three ecumenical creeds: the Apostles Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. 

The URCNA believe that &quot;marriage is designed to be a lifelong, monogamous covenantal union between one man and one woman.&quot;

== Practices ==
The practices of the URCNA are governed by a church order derived from the Synod of Dordt of 1618-1619. The URCNA church order outlines the duties of the three ecclesiastical offices of ministers, elders, and deacons within the denomination. 

It also sets out the denomination&#x27;s decentralized presbyteral form of church government as opposed to the hierarchical form of government found within the Anglican Church or Catholic Church. Each congregation is governed by a consistory made up of the elders elected from the congregation and the minister of the congregation. Periodically, delegates from each consistory will attend a regional classis or a denomination-wide synod to discuss matters pertaining to the entire denomination. Both classes and synods are temporary bodies with no formal authority. Although they may provide advice on matters to local consistories that carry great weight, the final authority rests with the consistories of each local congregation.

The church articulates the many practices of the URCNA churches. URCNA churches hold two services every Sunday with the expectation that members attend both services. The morning service typically focuses on preaching based on a particular passage in the Bible, while the afternoon or evening service normally is dedicated to being an explanation of one of the doctrines articulated the Three Forms of Unity. Both psalms and hymns may be sung during the worship service, although the psalms occupy the principal place of singing during the services. The URCNA practices infant baptism and requires a public profession of faith once members are spiritually mature (usually between the ages of 16-19). After members make this public profession of faith, they may partake of the Lord&#x27;s Supper and are eligible to vote within the church. 

The URCNA church order also outlines the process of church discipline.

== Statistics ==
URCNA churches can be found in 22 US states, mostly in the Upper Midwest (Iowa and Michigan) and California, and in six Canadian Provinces, mostly in Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia. As of 2018, the churches have grown, mostly through additional members leaving the CRCNA in the late 1990s, to 130 congregations spread across the United States and Canada, with 25,288 members, 198 ministers, and 8 Classes (Michigan, Central US, Eastern US, Southwest US, Pacific Northwest, Ontario East, Southwestern Ontario, Western Canada) in 2021.

== Missions ==

The URCNA supports many missions in the US and around the world. Mission churches can be found in Ecuador, Costa Rica, the Philippines, Mexico, and other third world countries. Individual members and individual churches may support missions through parachurch mission organizations such as Word and Deed although the denomination also has its own URCNA Missions coordinator. The URCNA monthly missions newsletters is called The Trumpet.

== Training of ministers ==
The United Reformed Churches do not have a denominational seminary or college; rather, Candidates for Ministry are extensively examined by their Calling Church and Classis regardless of seminary prior to their ordination or installation. Most of the ministers of the URCNA have been trained at Calvin Theological Seminary (Grand Rapids, Michigan), Mid-America Reformed Seminary (Dyer, Indiana), or Westminster Seminary in California (Escondido, California) but the number of other seminaries represented is growing.

== Mergers ==
The Orthodox Christian Reformed Churches, another breakaway from the Christian Reformed Church, voted to join the URCNA in 2008 upon the latter&#x27;s invitation.

== Interchurch relationships ==
The URCNA is in full ecumenical fellowship with the Canadian and American Reformed Churches, Orthodox Presbyterian Church, Reformed Church in the United States, Reformed Church of Quebec and Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America.

The URCNA also has dialogue with the Reformed Churches of New Zealand, Korean American Presbyterian Church, Presbyterian Church in America and other confessional Reformed churches. It is a member of the International Conference of Reformed Churches and the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council.

<doc id="820337" wikidata="Q1683912" url="?curid=820337" title="Jason Giambi">
<text>Jason Gilbert Giambi (; born January 8, 1971) is an American former professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter. In his Major League Baseball (MLB) career, which began in 1995, Giambi played for the Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Colorado Rockies, and Cleveland Indians. He is the older brother of the late MLB player Jeremy Giambi.

Giambi was the American League (AL) MVP in 2000 while with the Athletics, and is a five-time All-Star, who led the AL in walks four times; in on-base percentage three times; and in doubles and slugging percentage once each; he also won the Silver Slugger Award twice. Giambi has publicly apologized for using performance-enhancing drugs during his career.

==Early life==
Giambi attended Sacred Heart Private Catholic School in Covina, California. He then attended South Hills High School in his native West Covina, where he was a three-sport standout. Giambi was on the baseball team, whose roster also included his brother Jeremy and three other future major league players: infielder Shawn Wooten, pitchers Aaron Small and Cory Lidle. He batted .386 during his three years of varsity baseball, leading his team to the state finals as a senior. He was voted MVP in both baseball and basketball. In American football, he was an All-League quarterback. Giambi was selected in the 43rd round (1,118th overall) by the Milwaukee Brewers during the 1989 MLB draft. He did not sign and went on to attend college.

==College career==
Giambi attended Cal State Long Beach, where he played college baseball for the Long Beach State 49ers baseball team. Giambi played collegiate summer baseball for the Alaska Goldpanners, in the Alaska Baseball League.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Oakland Athletics selected Giambi in the second round (58th overall) of the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. He started his career that year with the short-season Single-A Southern Oregon A&#x27;s of the Northwest League, where he hit .317 in 13 games. He was a member of the fourth place United States national baseball team at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. The Athletics invited Giambi to spring training in 1993. He then spent the 1993 season playing for the Modesto A&#x27;s, the Oakland Athletics&#x27; Single-A farm team. Giambi also played for the Huntsville Stars in the Southern League and the Kauai Emeralds in the Hawaii Winter Baseball league.

===Oakland Athletics (1995–2001)===
Giambi made his major league debut with the Athletics in 1995. Originally used occasionally as an outfielder, third baseman, and first baseman, Giambi assumed the fulltime first base job upon the trade of Mark McGwire to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1997. Giambi led the team in 1998 with 27 home runs, 110 runs batted in and a .295 batting average. In 1999, Giambi hit .315 with 33 homers, 105 walks (second in the league), and 123 RBIs (sixth). He came in eighth in MLB Most Valuable Player Award voting.

Giambi hit two home runs in Oakland&#x27;s 2000 season opener on April 3, the first Athletics player to ever do so. In the 2000 season, he led the league in on-base percentage (.476; leading the majors) and walks (137; a personal high and still the most walks in the AL since 1991). He hit .333 (seventh in the league) with 43 homers (second; a career high), 137 RBIs (fourth; a career high), 108 runs (10th), and a .647 slugging percentage (third). Giambi narrowly won the American League Most Valuable Player Award over Frank Thomas.

His 2001 season was nearly identical. He led the league for the second year in a row in both on-base percentage (.477; a career best, and still the highest OBP in the AL since 1995) and walks (129). He also led the league in slugging percentage (.660; a career best), doubles (47; a career high), times on base (320), and extra base hits (87). He batted .342 (second in the American League; a career high) with 38 homers (seventh), 109 runs (sixth), and 120 RBIs (eighth). He was second in the league in intentional walks (24), the only time in his career that he was in the top 10 in this category. He finished a close second in MVP voting to Ichiro Suzuki, and won the Silver Slugger Award.

Both years, he led the Athletics to the postseason, both times losing in the American League Division Series to the New York Yankees in five games.

===New York Yankees (2002–2008)===

On December 13, 2001, Giambi signed a seven-year $120-million deal with the New York Yankees. In line with Yankee team rules, Giambi cut his long hair and shaved his goatee. The signing upset many Athletics fans, who felt betrayed by the departure of their team leader. Giambi became an object of the A&#x27;s fans&#x27; wrath whenever New York visited Oakland. During a game on May 14, 2005, he was hit with a beer thrown by an unruly fan on his way back to the dugout.

Giambi continued slugging with New York in 2002. He led the league for the second consecutive year in times on base (300), had 109 walks (second), was third in the league with both a .435 OBP and 15 HBP, had 41 home runs (fourth), 120 runs (fourth; a career high), and a .598 slugging percentage (fourth), knocked in 122 runs (fifth), and batted .314 (sixth). He came in fifth in AL MVP voting, and again won the Silver Slugger Award. He also hit an &quot;ultimate grand slam&quot;—a walk-off grand slam against the Twins in a rain-soaked extra-inning game, that won that game 13–12.

Although his average dipped to .250 in 2003, he led the league in walks (129) for the third time in his career and in HBP (21) and percent of plate appearances that were walks (19.4%), maintained an extremely high on-base percentage (.412; third in the league), hit 41 home runs (fourth), and had 107 RBIs (eighth). He was also second in the major leagues in fly ball percentage (52.0%). He remained one of the most patient hitters in the majors. At the same time, he also led the league in strikeouts (140), the only season that he has even been in the top 10 in the league in that category. On July 30, 2004, test results confirmed that Giambi had a benign tumor, which placed him on the disabled list. He was treated for the tumor, and returned to the team for their game against the Kansas City Royals on September 14. That year, Giambi was voted in as the starting first baseman in the 2004 MLB All-Star Game despite finishing the year with a .208 batting average and just 12 home runs. Giambi&#x27;s performance in 2004 was so poor that he was not added to the Yankees postseason roster.

Towards the middle of the 2005 season, Giambi saw a resurgence in his career. On July 31, he hit his 300th career home run off of Esteban Yan of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This was his 14th home run of the month, tying Mickey Mantle for the Yankee record for home runs in July. Giambi ended the 2005 season leading the major leagues in walk percentage (20.6%) and leading the American League in walks for the fourth time in his career (109), and in OBP for the third time in his career (.440, as well as in fly ball percentage (47.7%); second in MLB to Todd Helton), and had an OPS of .975, placing him fifth in the AL. He hit 32 homers (10th in the league), the seventh time in his career in which he has hit 30 or more, and was fourth in HBP (19) and at-bats per home run (13.0). Giambi was named the AL Comeback Player of the Year.

In 2006, Giambi was named the American League Player of the Month for April, hitting .344 with nine home runs and driving in 27 runs. However, he was left off the 2006 American League All-Star roster. He finished the season leading the majors in walk percentage (19.8%) and leading the league in % Pitches Taken (64.4), second in walks (110), HBP (16), and pitches seen per PA (4.37), fifth in at bats per home run (12.1), sixth in on-base percentage (.416), seventh in home runs (37) and slugging percentage (.558), eighth in intentional walks (12), and ninth in RBIs (113), despite playing in only 139 games (half of them at DH, and half at 1B) for the second year in a row. He performed the unusual feat of having as many RBIs as hits, and for the third time in his career had more walks than strikeouts. Giambi&#x27;s numbers were down precipitously in the 2007 season due to an injury, in which he hit just .236 with 14 home runs and 39 RBIs. He played in just 83 games, 53 of which as a designated hitter. Giambi got off to a horrible start in the 2008 season, hitting below .200 for more than a month. However, by June, he had turned his season around and become one of the team&#x27;s most productive players.

On September 3, 2008, Giambi walked into a bathroom door in his hotel room while in Florida before playing against the Tampa Bay Rays. The accident caused him to split his eyelid open but he played through the injury later that night and went 1-for-4 with one RBI, helping the Yankees win the second game of the series.

On September 21, 2008, Giambi recorded the final hit in Yankee Stadium, when he drove in Brett Gardner with an RBI single.

Giambi ended the season with a home run every 14.3 at-bats, beating out Alex Rodriguez to lead the team by a small margin. He was also one of only three players to hit a home run while pinch hitting in 2008, and the only one to do it twice. However, on November 4, 2008, the Yankees declined their option on Giambi for the 2009 season making him a free agent.

===Second stint with the Athletics (2009)===
On January 6, 2009, Giambi agreed to sign with the Oakland Athletics. He officially re-joined the A&#x27;s the next day, and was given his old No. 16 jersey. Giambi hit his first home run since returning to the Athletics on April 25, 2009.

On May 23, 2009, Giambi hit his 400th career home run in an 8–7 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was placed on the disabled list on July 20. At the time, Giambi had the lowest batting average in the majors, and fourth-lowest slugging percentage in the American League. On August 7, 2009, he was released by the A&#x27;s.

===Colorado Rockies (2009–2012)===
Looking for a veteran bat to help their playoff push, the Colorado Rockies agreed to a deal with Giambi on August 23, 2009. He was assigned to their AAA affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Giambi chose to wear the number 23 for his jersey number. His first RBI with the Rockies came in the form of a bases loaded walk in his first plate appearance on September 1, 2009, after being promoted to the club upon roster expansion earlier that day. That year, he had many clutch hits which kept the Rockies in contention for the National League Wild Card. He quickly became a fan favorite in Colorado.

On January 23, 2010, Giambi reached an agreement to return to the Rockies. On September 12, Giambi hit a walk-off home run against the Arizona Diamondbacks, extending the winning streak for the Rockies to 10 games.
The Colorado Rockies announced on January 17, 2011, a deal to put Giambi in the team&#x27;s minor league organization with a spring training invite for the 2011 season. Giambi made the 2011 Opening Day roster out of spring training.

On May 19, 2011, against the Philadelphia Phillies, Giambi hit three home runs in one game, the first such game for him of his career. The three home runs came in his first three at-bats. Giambi is also the second oldest player to accomplish the feat; at age 41, Stan Musial was the oldest player to hit three home runs in one game on July 8, 1962.

Giambi became a free agent after the 2012 season and was a finalist for the Rockies major league managerial opening, which eventually went to Walt Weiss. Giambi was offered the position of Colorado&#x27;s hitting coach but turned it down.

===Cleveland Indians (2013–2014)===
The Cleveland Indians signed Giambi to a minor league contract on February 9, 2013. Giambi made the Indians major league roster following spring training. On July 29, 2013, Giambi became the oldest player to hit a walk-off home run. He broke his own record for oldest player to hit a walk-off home run in a season saving win for the Indians against the White Sox on September 24, 2013.

Giambi was re-signed by the Indians on October 31, 2013, to a one-year minor league deal. The deal included an invitation to Spring Training. Giambi was hit by an Edwin Jackson pitch on March 7, 2014. This resulted in a broken rib, and Giambi missed the first 18 games of the season. He was activated on April 21.

On August 2, 2014, Giambi gave up his 25 jersey number to Jim Thome to have it unofficially retired by the Indians; Giambi switched his jersey number to 72 that day. On the jersey that he gave to Thome, Giambi put down a message to Thome saying &quot;Jim, It was an honor to be the last person to wear your uniform number in Cleveland Indians history! – Jason Giambi&quot; It was kept a secret from the fans, the players, Thome himself and his family, happening after Thome signed the one-day contract and threw out the first pitch.

On February 16, 2015, Giambi announced his retirement.

===BALCO scandal===
Late in 2003, Giambi was named by FBI officers investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) as being one of the baseball players believed to have received anabolic steroids from trainer Greg Anderson.

In December 2004, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported it had seen Giambi&#x27;s 2003 grand jury testimony in the BALCO investigation. The newspaper said that in his testimony, Giambi admitted to using several different steroids during the off-seasons from 2001 to 2003, and injecting himself with human growth hormone during the 2003 season. In a press conference prior to the 2005 season, Giambi apologized publicly to the media and his fans, though he did not specifically state what for. The lawyer who illegally leaked the testimony later pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to years in prison.

Giambi apologized again on May 16, 2007, this time specifically for using steroids, and urged others in the sport to do the same. &quot;I was wrong for using that stuff&quot;, he told &quot;USA Today&quot;. &quot;What we should have done a long time ago was stand up—players, ownership, everybody—and said, &#x27;We made a mistake.&#x27;&quot; When asked why he used steroids, Giambi responded: &quot;Maybe one day I&#x27;ll talk about it, but not now.&quot; Giambi did speak with George J. Mitchell, after being forced to do so by Bud Selig. Subsequently, in December 2007, the Mitchell Report included Giambi along with his brother Jeremy Giambi, who also admitted to using steroids during his career.

The prosecution in the Barry Bonds perjury case indicated they intended to call both Jason and Jeremy Giambi to testify against Bonds in his March 2009 trial.

==Personal life==

Giambi married Kristian on February 2, 2002. His wife is the designer and owner of a lingerie and loungewear company called Brulee. Giambi is one of the owners of Casa Cielo (also owned by Scott Deskins of SCC Development in Austin, Texas) in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. It is an home on top of the Pedregal sign. His co-owned property was put up for auction in 2019. Giambi&#x27;s siblings include former major-leaguer Jeremy Giambi, who died in 2022, and a sister named Julie.

==Video game covers==
Giambi has appeared as the featured athlete on the cover of several video games throughout his career.

Giambi has also been featured as a playable character in &quot;Backyard Baseball 2001&quot; as well as &quot;Backyard Baseball 2003&quot;.

===Other media===
Giambi also appeared in &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;, a television drama that debuted on ESPN in 2007, as a taxi cab driver.
