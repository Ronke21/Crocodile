<text>Chesapeake was a 38-gun wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy. She was one of the original six frigates whose construction was authorized by the Naval Act of 1794. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young navy&#x27;s capital ships. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was originally designed as a 44-gun frigate, but construction delays, material shortages and budget problems caused builder Josiah Fox to alter his design to 38 guns. Launched at the Gosport Navy Yard on 2 December 1799, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; began her career during the Quasi-War with France and later saw service in the First Barbary War.

On 22 June 1807 she was fired upon by of the Royal Navy for refusing to allow a search for deserters. The event, now known as the &quot;Chesapeake–Leopard&quot; affair, angered the American public and government and was a precipitating factor that led to the War of 1812. As a result of the affair, &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s commanding officer, James Barron, was court-martialed and the United States instituted the Embargo Act of 1807 against the United Kingdom.

Early in the War of 1812 she made one patrol and captured five British merchant ships. She was captured by shortly after sailing from Boston, Massachusetts, on 1 June 1813. The Royal Navy took her into their service as HMS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, where she served until she was broken up and her timbers sold in 1819. Some of the pine deck planking was incorporated into the Chesapeake Mill in Wickham, England.

==Design and construction==
American merchant vessels began to fall prey to Barbary Pirates, mainly from Algiers, in the Mediterranean during the 1790s. Congress responded with the Naval Act of 1794. The act provided funds for the construction of six frigates, and directed that the construction would continue unless and until the United States agreed peace terms with Algiers.

Joshua Humphreys&#x27; design was long of keel and incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping) and included extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Since the fledgling United States could not match the number of ships of the European states, Humphreys designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line. However, Chesapeake was a scaled-down version of his more famous designs for Constitution, United States and President, being closer in size to the standard European frigates of the day, and mounting the usual armament of 18-pounder guns.

Originally designated as &quot;Frigate D&quot;, the ship remained unnamed for several years. Her keel was laid down in December 1795 at the Gosport Navy Yard in Norfolk County – now the city of Portsmouth in Hampton Roads, Virginia, where Josiah Fox had been appointed her naval constructor and Richard Dale as superintendent of construction. In March 1796 a peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers and construction was suspended in accordance with the Naval Act of 1794. The keel remained on blocks in the navy yard for two years.

The onset of the Quasi-War with France in 1798 prompted Congress to authorize completion of &quot;Frigate D&quot;, and they approved resumption of the work on 16 July. When Fox returned to Norfolk he discovered a shortage of timber caused by its diversion from Norfolk to Baltimore in order to finish . He corresponded with Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert, who indicated a desire to expedite construction of the ship and reduce the overall cost. Fox, always an opponent of Humphreys&#x27; large design, submitted new plans to Stoddert which called for utilizing the existing keel but reducing the overall dimensions substantially in length and partially of beam. Fox&#x27;s plans essentially proposed an entirely different design than originally planned by Humphreys. Secretary Stoddert approved the new design plans.

When construction finished, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; had the smallest dimensions of the six frigates. A length of between perpendiculars and of beam contrasted with her closest sisters, and &quot;Constellation&quot;, which were built to in length and of beam. The final cost of her construction was $220,677—the second-least expensive frigate of the six. The least expensive was &quot;Congress&quot; at $197,246.

During construction, a sloop named &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was launched on 20 June 1799 but was renamed between 10 October and 14 November, apparently to free up the name &quot;Chesapeake&quot; for &quot;Frigate D&quot;. In communications between Fox and Stoddert, Fox repeatedly referred to her as &quot;Congress&quot;, further confusing matters, until he was informed by Stoddert the ship was to be named &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, after Chesapeake Bay. She was the only one of the six frigates not named by President George Washington, nor after a principle of the United States Constitution.

===Armament===
&quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s nominal rating is stated as either 36 or 38 guns. Originally designated as a 44-gun ship, her redesign by Fox led to a rerating, apparently based on her smaller dimensions when compared to &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot;. Joshua Humphreys may have rerated &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to 38 guns, or Secretary Stoddert may have rerated &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot; to 38 guns because they were larger than &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, which was rated to 36 guns. The most recent information on her rating is from the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot;, published in 2011, which states she was rerated &quot;from 44 guns to 36, eventually increased to 38&quot;. Her gun rating remained a matter of confusion throughout her career; Fox used a 44-gun rating in his correspondence with Secretary Stoddert. In preparing for the War of 1812 Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton directed Captain Samuel Evans to recruit the number of crewmen required for a 44-gun ship. Hamilton was corrected by William Bainbridge in a letter stating, &quot;There is a mistake in the crew ordered for the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, as it equals in number the crews of our 44-gun frigates, whereas the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; is of the class of the &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot;.&quot; Letters between Stoddert, Fox, and others dated 26 October, 1799 it was stated she was supposed to have 28 18 pounders and 16 9 pounders, but was revised at an unknown point to 30 18 pounders and 14 12 pounders. The change was cancelled. There was a question as to the gun deck being pierced for 28 or 30 guns. When sold for scrap by the Royal Navy in 1819, she was rated as a 48-gun ship.

Gun ratings did not correspond to the actual number of guns a ship would carry. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was noted as carrying 40 guns during her encounter with in 1807 and 50 guns during her engagement with in 1813. The 50 guns consisted of twenty-eight 18-pounder (8 kg) long guns on the gun deck, fourteen on each side. This main battery was complemented by two long 12-pounders (5.5 kg), one long 18-pounder, eighteen 32-pounder (14.5 kg) carronades, and one 12-pound carronade on the spar deck. Her broadside weight was .

The ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns; guns were completely portable and were often exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer modified his vessel&#x27;s armament to his liking while taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel&#x27;s armament would change often during its career; records of the changes were not generally kept.

==Quasi-War==
&quot;Chesapeake&quot; was launched on 2 December 1799 during the undeclared Quasi-War (1798–1800), which arose after the French navy seized American merchant ships. Her fitting-out continued until May 1800. In March Josiah Fox was reprimanded by Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert for continuing to work on &quot;Chesapeake&quot; while &quot;Congress&quot;, still awaiting completion, was fully manned with a crew drawing pay. Stoddert appointed Thomas Truxton to ensure that his directives concerning &quot;Congress&quot; were carried out.

&quot;Chesapeake&quot; first put to sea on 22 May commanded by Captain Samuel Barron and marked her departure from Norfolk with a 13-gun salute. Her first assignment was to carry currency from Charleston, South Carolina, to Philadelphia. On 6 June she joined a squadron patrolling off the southern coast of the United States and in the West Indies escorting American merchant ships.

Capturing the 16-gun French privateer &quot;La Jeune Creole&quot; on 1 January 1801 after a chase lasting 50 hours, she returned to Norfolk with her prize on 15 January. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; returned briefly to the West Indies in February, soon after a peace treaty was ratified with France. She returned to Norfolk and decommissioned on 26 February, subsequently being placed in reserve.

==First Barbary War==

During the Quasi-War, the United States had paid tribute to the Barbary States to ensure that they would not seize or harass American merchant ships. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute he received in comparison to that paid to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000. Thomas Jefferson responded by sending a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace negotiations with the Barbary States. The first squadron was under the command of Richard Dale in &quot;President&quot;. and the second was assigned to the command of Richard Valentine Morris in &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. Morris&#x27;s squadron eventually consisted of the vessels &quot;Constellation&quot;, , , , and . It took several months to prepare the vessels for sea; they departed individually as they became ready.

Captain Thomas Truxton was ordered to take command of Chesapeake on 12 January, 1802 by the Secretary of the Navy. He proposed that he should be squadron commander of the new squadron leaving for the Mediterranean, or he should leave the service, in a letter to Secretary of the Navy dated 3 March, 1802. Secretary of the Navy ordered Capt. Richard V. Morris to take command of Chesapeake in a letter dated 11 March, 1802. Truxton was relieved of command by the Navy Secretary in a letter dated 13 March with Lt. William Smith taking temporary command.
&quot;Chesapeake&quot; sailed from Hampton Roads on 27 April 1802 and arrived at Gibraltar on 25 May; she immediately put in for repairs, as her main mast had split during the voyage. Morris remained at Gibraltar while awaiting word on the location of his squadron, as several ships had not reported in. On 22 July &quot;Adams&quot; arrived with belated orders for Morris, dated 20 April. Those were to &quot;lay the whole squadron before Tripoli&quot; and negotiate peace. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; departed Gibraltar on 17 August bound for Leghorn, while providing protection for a convoy of merchant ships that were bound for intermediate ports. Morris made several stops in various ports before finally arriving at Leghorn on 12 October, after which he sailed to Malta. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; undertook repairs of a rotted bowsprit. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was still in port when &quot;John Adams&quot; arrived on 5 January 1803 with orders dated 23 October 1802 from Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith. These directed &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot; to return to the United States; Morris was to transfer his command to &quot;New York&quot;. &quot;Constellation&quot; sailed directly as ordered, but Morris retained &quot;Chesapeake&quot; at Malta, claiming that she was not in any condition to make an Atlantic voyage during the winter months.

Morris now had the ships &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;John Adams&quot;, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; gathered under him, while &quot;Adams&quot; was at Gibraltar. On 30 January &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and the squadron got underway for Tripoli, where Morris planned to burn Tripolitan ships in the harbor. Heavy gales made the approach to Tripoli difficult. Fearing &quot;Chesapeake&quot; would lose her masts from the strong winds, Morris returned to Malta on 10 February. With provisions for the ships running low and none available near Malta, Morris decided to abandon plans to blockade Tripoli and sailed the squadron back to Gibraltar for provisioning. They made stops at Tunis on 22 February and Algiers on 19 March. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 23 March, where Morris transferred his command to &quot;New York&quot;. Under James Barron, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; sailed for the United States on 7 April and she was placed in reserve at the Washington Navy Yard on 1 June, 1803.

Morris remained in the Mediterranean until September, when orders from Secretary Smith arrived suspending his command and instructing him to return to the United States. There he faced a Naval Board of Inquiry which found that he was censurable for &quot;inactive and dilatory conduct of the squadron under his command&quot;. He was dismissed from the navy in 1804. Morris&#x27;s overall performance in the Mediterranean was particularly criticized for the state of affairs aboard &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and his inactions as a commander. His wife, young son, and housekeeper accompanied him on the voyage, during which his wife gave birth to another son. Midshipman Henry Wadsworth wrote that he and the other midshipman referred to Mrs. Morris as the &quot;Commodoress&quot; and believed she was the main reason behind &quot;Chesapeake&quot; remaining in port for months at a time. Consul William Eaton reported to Secretary Smith that Morris and his squadron spent more time in port sightseeing and doing little but &quot;dance and wench&quot;, rather than blockading Tripoli.

==&quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; Affair==

In January 1807 Master Commandant Charles Gordon was appointed &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s commanding officer (captain). He was ordered to prepare her for patrol and convoy duty in the Mediterranean to relieve her sister ship , which had been on duty there since 1803. James Barron was appointed overall commander of the squadron as its commodore. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was in much disarray from her multi-year period of inactivity and many months were required for repairs, provisioning, and recruitment of personnel. Lieutenant Arthur Sinclair was tasked with the recruiting. Among those chosen were three sailors who had deserted from . The British ambassador to the United States requested the return of the sailors. Barron found that, although they were indeed from &quot;Melampus&quot;, they had been impressed into Royal Navy service from the beginning. He therefore refused to release them back to &quot;Melampus&quot; and nothing further was communicated on the subject.

In early June &quot;Chesapeake&quot; departed the Washington Navy Yard for Norfolk, Virginia, where she completed provisioning and loading armaments. Captain Gordon informed Barron on the 19th that &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was ready for sea and they departed on 22 June armed with 40 guns. At the same time, a British squadron consisting of HMS &quot;Melampus&quot;, , and &quot;Leopard&quot; (a 50-gun fourth rate) were lying off the port of Norfolk blockading two French ships there. As &quot;Chesapeake&quot; departed, the squadron ships began signaling each other and &quot;Leopard&quot; got under way, preceding &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to sea.

After sailing for some hours, &quot;Leopard&quot;, commanded by Captain Salusbury Humphreys, approached &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and hailed a request to deliver dispatches to England, a customary request of the time. When a British lieutenant arrived by boat he handed Barron an order, given by Vice-Admiral George Berkeley of the Royal Navy, which instructed the British ships to stop and board &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to search for deserters. Barron refused to allow this search, and as the lieutenant returned to &quot;Leopard&quot; Barron ordered the crew to general quarters. Shortly afterward &quot;Leopard&quot; hailed &quot;Chesapeake&quot;; Barron could not understand the message. &quot;Leopard&quot; fired a shot across the bow, followed by a broadside, at &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. For fifteen minutes, while &quot;Chesapeake&quot; attempted to arm herself, &quot;Leopard&quot; continued to fire broadside after broadside until Barron struck his colors. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; only managed to fire one retaliatory shot after hot coals from the galley were brought on deck to ignite the cannon. The British boarded &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and removed four deserters, declining Barron&#x27;s offer that &quot;Chesapeake&quot; be taken as a prize of war. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; suffered three sailors killed and Barron was among the eighteen wounded.

Word of the incident spread quickly on &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s return to Hampton Roads, where the British squadron that included &quot;Leopard&quot; was provisioning. Mobs of angry citizens destroyed two hundred water casks destined for the squadron and nearly killed a British lieutenant before local authorities intervened. The fourth death of a &quot;Chesapeake&quot; sailor two days later came in the midst of the growing outrage. The coffin holding the body of Robert MacDonald was transported across the Elizabeth River, which flowed between Portsmouth and Norfolk, amid cannon tributes and ships at half mast and an estimated 4,000 citizens to receive it at the Norfolk wharf.

In subsequent days, the event would lead to the angry resolutions of town governments on the east coast and into the Midwest. In Pennsylvania, a group representing the state&#x27;s First Congressional District declared the attack &quot;an act of such consummate violence and wrong, and of so barbarous and murderous a character that it would debase and degrade any nation and much more so a nation of freemen to submit to it.&quot;

President Jefferson recalled all US warships from the Mediterranean and issued a proclamation: all British warships were banned from entering US ports and those already in port were to depart. The incident eventually led to the Embargo Act of 1807. As the first significant conflict between America and Great Britain after the Revolutionary War, it would give energy to what some historians would deem the second Revolutionary War, the War of 1812.

&quot;Chesapeake&quot; was completely unprepared to defend herself during the incident. None of her guns were primed for operation and the spar deck was filled with materials that were not properly stowed in the cargo hold. A court-martial was convened for Barron and Captain Gordon, as well as Lieutenant Hall of the Marines. Barron was found guilty of &quot;neglecting on the probability of an engagement to clear his Ship for action&quot; and suspended from the navy for five years. Gordon and Hall were privately reprimanded, and the ship&#x27;s gunner was discharged from the navy.

==War of 1812==

After the heavy damage inflicted by &quot;Leopard&quot;, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; returned to Norfolk for repairs. Under the command of Stephen Decatur, she made patrols off the New England coast enforcing the Embargo Act throughout 1809.

The &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; Affair, and later the &quot;Little Belt&quot; affair, contributed to the United States&#x27; decision to declare war on Britain on 18 June 1812. &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, under the command of Captain Samuel Evans, was prepared for duty in the Atlantic. Beginning on 13 December, she ranged from Madeira and traveled clockwise to the Cape Verde Islands and South America, and then back to Boston. She captured six ships as prizes: the British ships &quot;Volunteer&quot;, , &quot;EarlPercy&quot;, and &quot;Ellen&quot;, the brig &quot;Julia&quot; (an American ship trading under a British license), and &quot;Valeria&quot; (an American ship recaptured from British privateers). During the cruise an unidentified British ship-of-the-line and a frigate chased &quot;Chesapeake&quot; but, after a passing storm squall, the two pursuing ships were gone the next morning. The cargo of &quot;Volunteer&quot;, 40 tons of pig iron and copper, was sold for $185,000. &quot;Earl Percy&quot; never made it back to port as she ran aground off the coast of Long Island. &quot;Liverpool Hero&quot; was burned as she was considered leaky. &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s total monetary damage to British shipping was $235,675 (equivalent to $ million in ). She returned to Boston on 9 April 1813 for refitting.

Captain Evans, now in poor health, requested relief of command. Captain James Lawrence, late of and her victory over , took command of &quot;Chesapeake&quot; on 20 May. Matters on board the ship were in disarray. The term of enlistment for many of the crew had expired and they were daily leaving the ship. Those who remained were disgruntled and approaching mutiny, as the prize money they were owed from her previous cruise was held up in court. Lawrence paid out the prize money from his own pocket in order to appease them. Some sailors from &quot;Constitution&quot; joined &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and they made up the crew, along with sailors of several nations.

Meanwhile, HMS &quot;Shannon&quot;, a 38-gun frigate, under Captain Philip Broke was patrolling off the port of Boston on blockade duty. &quot;Shannon&quot; had been under the command of Broke since 1806 and, under his direction, the crew held daily great gun and small arms drills lasting up to three hours each. Crew members who hit their bullseye were awarded a pound (454 g) of tobacco for their good marksmanship. Broke had also fitted out his cannons with dispart and tangent sights to increase accuracy as well as degree bearings on the decks and gun carriages to allow the crew to focus their fire on a specific target. In this regard &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, with traditional gun practice and a crew that had only been together for a few months, was inferior.

===&quot;Chesapeake&quot; vs &quot;Shannon&quot;===


Lawrence, advised that &quot;Shannon&quot; had moved in closer to Boston, began preparations to sail on the evening of 31 May. The next morning Broke wrote a challenge to Lawrence and dispatched it to &quot;Chesapeake&quot;; it had not arrived when Lawrence set out to meet &quot;Shannon&quot; on his own accord.

Leaving port with a broad white flag bearing the motto &quot;Free Trade and Sailors&#x27; Rights&quot;, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; met &quot;Shannon&quot; near 5 pm that afternoon. During six minutes of firing, each ship managed two full broadsides. &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s first broadside was fired while the ship was heeling, causing most shots to strike the water or &quot;Shannon&quot;″s waterline, causing little damage; although carronade fire caused serious damage to &quot;Shannon&quot;″s rigging. A second round of fire was more effective, landing hits on &quot;Shannon&quot;″s 12-pounder shot locker. &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s 32-pound carronades punished &quot;Shannon&quot;″s forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling &quot;Shannon&quot;″s nine-pounder bow gun. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; suffered far more heavily in the exchange, as accurate British fire caused heavy losses among American gun crews, and crippling losses to the men and officers on &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s quarterdeck. A succession of helmsmen were killed and her wheel was destroyed. At the same time, her foretopsail halyard was shot away causing the ship to lose maneuverability.

Unable to maneuver, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; &quot;luffed up&quot; and her port stern quarter caught against the side of &quot;Shannon&quot; amidships and the two ships were lashed together. Confusion and disarray reigned on the deck of &quot;Chesapeake&quot;; Captain Lawrence tried rallying a party to board &quot;Shannon&quot;, but the bugler failed to sound the call. At this point a shot from a sniper mortally wounded Lawrence; as his men carried him below, he gave his last order: &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship. Fight her till she sinks.&quot; There are varying historical accounts of what Lawrence may actually have uttered.

Captain Broke boarded &quot;Chesapeake&quot; at the head of a party of 20 men. They met little resistance from &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from &quot;Chesapeake&quot; came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck in the head with a sword. Soon after, &quot;Shannon&quot;″s crew pulled down &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s flag. Only 15 minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.

Reports on the number of killed and wounded aboard &quot;Chesapeake&quot; during the battle vary widely. Broke&#x27;s after-action report from 6 July states 70 killed and 100 wounded. Other contemporary sources place the number between 48 and 61 killed and 85–99 wounded. Discrepancies in the number of killed and wounded are possibly caused by the addition of sailors who died of their wounds after the battle. The counts for &quot;Shannon&quot; have fewer discrepancies with 23 killed and 56 wounded. Despite his serious injuries, Broke ordered repairs to both ships and they proceeded on to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Captain Lawrence died en route of his wounds and was buried in a Halifax cemetery with full military honors. The dead crewmen were buried on Dead Man&#x27;s Island in Nova Scotia. Captain Broke survived his wounds and was later made a baronet.

==Royal Navy service and legacy==


The Royal Navy repaired &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and took her into service as HMS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. She served on the Halifax station under the command of Alexander Dixie until 1814, and, in April, was sighted in the Chesapeake Bay, off the coast of Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore.
Later that year and under the command of George Burdett she sailed to Plymouth, England, for repairs in October of that year. Afterward she made a voyage to Cape Town, South Africa, until learning of the peace treaty with the United States in May 1815. Later that year a report was made concerning &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s performance in British service. Her captain observed that she was strongly constructed, but criticized the excessive overhang of the stern. He concluded that she was not a suitable ship to serve as a model for copying. Her speed under sail was not impressive: close-hauled and large.

In 1819, the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, constructed in Portsmouth, Virginia, was sold for £500 to Joshua Holmes in Portsmouth, England, and her various components were offered for sale in the &quot;Hampshire Telegraph and Sussex Chronicle&quot;, published in Hampshire as a &quot;very large quantity of OAK and FIR TIMBER of most excellent quality, and well worth the attention of any person.&quot; Large, unbroken portions of the ship were bought by John Prior to build a new watermill at Wickham, Hampshire. The Chesapeake Mill would play a significant role in the agricultural economy of Hampshire until it became increasingly obsolescent in the 1970s. After failed attempts to preserve the mill as a historical center through the early 2000s, it was given over to commercial operators and operated as an antique mall in 2021.

As a watermill, the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; may be the most originally preserved of the original six frigates of the U.S. Navy. Interpretation of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, preserved in Boston harbor, suggests original wood or components from 0% to 15%. The Chesapeake Mill is constructed of largely intact and unaltered components of the original ship – timber configuration, lintels, stairways, the five main spine beams to each floor, the floor joists, the roof timbers, other wood – some appearing to show the grapeshot of battle. The wood has been preserved within a five-story building with walls and beneath a roof for 200 years.

In 1996 a timber fragment from the Chesapeake Mill was returned to the United States. It is on display at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.

Almost from her beginnings, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was considered an &quot;unlucky ship&quot;, the &quot;runt of the litter&quot; to the superstitious sailors of the 19th century, and the product of a disagreement between Humphreys and Fox. Her unsuccessful encounters with HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; and &quot;Shannon&quot;, the courts-martial of two of her captains, and the accidental deaths of several crewmen led many to believe she was cursed. Arguments defending both Humphreys and Fox regarding their long-standing disagreements over the design of the frigates carried on for years. Humphreys disowned any credit for Fox&#x27;s redesign of &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. In 1827 he wrote, &quot;She [&quot;Chesapeake&quot;] spoke his [Fox&#x27;s] talents. Which I leave the Commanders of that ship to estimate by her qualifications.&quot;

Lawrence&#x27;s last command of &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship!&quot; became a rallying cry for the US Navy. Oliver Hazard Perry, in command of naval forces on Lake Erie during September 1813, named his flagship , which flew a broad blue flag bearing the words &quot; give up the ship!&quot; The phrase is still used in the US Navy today.

&quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s battle-damaged ensign was sold at auction in London in 1908. Purchased by William Waldorf Astor, it now resides in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, along with her signal book. The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, holds several artifacts from the battle including the mess kettle, and an officers chest from &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. One of the 18-pounder guns from &quot;Chesapeake&quot; is mounted beside Province House, the Nova Scotia Legislature.

A fictionalized account of the battle between &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and &quot;Shannon&quot; appears at the conclusion of &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;, the sixth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by British author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1979. In 2021, the U.S. Navy announced that a namesake USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; would be constructed as a member of a &quot;Constellation&quot;-class of ships in future years.

<text>Horsens () is a city on the east coast of the Jutland region of Denmark. It is the seat of the Horsens municipality. The city&#x27;s population is 63,903 (1 January 2024) and the municipality&#x27;s population is 97,392 (), making it the 7th largest city in Denmark.

Horsens is best known for its culture and entertainment events. Horsens New Theatre is a cultural centre which holds over 200 events annually. It has managed to draw major names such as Madonna, One Direction, Paul McCartney and The Rolling Stones.

==Etymology==
It is believed the name Horsens derives from the old Danish words &quot;hors&quot; (horse) and &quot;næs&quot; (naze, headland). The name &quot;Horsens&quot; has been in use since the 12th century.

==History==

The earliest traces of a city are remains of a pagan burial site and houses dating back to the 9th century. In the 12th century, the kings Sweyn III and Valdemar I issued coins in the city. In the 13th century the city got its own legal code.

Excavations have shown that the city was expanded around 1300, with a moat going around the city and its harbour. Industrialization started from the middle of the 19th century. The population rose dramatically when people from the countryside moved to the city to work in the factories. The first Danish iron foundry outside of Copenhagen was opened as well as tobacco and textile factories.

==Geography==
Horsens lies at the end of Horsens Fjord in eastern Jutland. The city is surrounded by typical moraine landscape with low hills and valleys created by glaciers during the last ice ages. Horsens is south of Aarhus and north of Vejle, and approximately from Copenhagen.

==Economy==

The city is currently undergoing a positive development with new industry moving to Horsens, or expanding their activities already in Horsens. A lot of electronics and graphical companies are based there. Horsens also has the only Industrial Museum in Denmark. The city is also home to VIA University College which brings a lot of international students to move to this town.

==Culture==
In recent years, much effort has been made to expand and improve cultural events. Several internationally known artists, such as Madonna, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Joe Cocker, Elton John, The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, Tom Jones, Bryan Adams, David Bowie, José Carreras, Helmut Lotti, Westlife, R.E.M., Paul McCartney, Robbie Williams, The Rolling Stones, Dolly Parton, AC/DC, U2, Rammstein and Snow Patrol have performed, or have performances planned in Horsens.

Metallica has performed several times in Horsens.

Hard Rock/Heavy Metal band Pretty Maids is from Horsens.

One of the largest cultural events in Denmark is the annual European Medieval Festival on the last Friday and Saturday in August. The town centre of Horsens is transformed into the largest medieval market town in Northern Europe with activities and entertainment for families and children of all ages.

Every March, Horsens hosts a Crime Fiction Festival. The &quot;Crime Festival&quot; – in Danish called &quot;Krimimessen&quot; – is an event for literary crime, mysteries and thrillers. The Crime Festival is organized by Horsens Public Library. Every year, many well-known crime writers visit Horsens.

The city is home to &quot;Horsens Industrimuseum&quot;, a museum showing the history of the industrial society. The museum shows technological development and developments in living conditions for workers.

Peter Sørensen from the Social Democrats is mayor of Horsens.

Vitus Bering, the famous Russian Navy captain, was born here.

==Education==

The largest educational institution in Horsens is VIA University College, which offers a wide range of engineering, technical and business programmes for Danish and International students. In the summer of 2020, VIA University College accepted 1066 new students. That was 2.1% more than the number of students that were accepted to the university the year before.

==Sport==
Horsens is the home to professional football club AC Horsens who play in the Danish Superliga. Their home ground is the 10,400 capacity CASA Arena Horsens.

From 2015 to 2018, the CASA Arena hosted motorcycle speedway, when it held the Speedway Grand Prix of Denmark, taking over as host from the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, which had held the Speedway Grand Prix event from 2003 to 2014. Frederikslyst Speedway was another speedway venue located approximately 8 kilometres south west of the town, off the Frederikslystvej in the forest (). It held the final of the Danish Individual Speedway Championship in 1995.

Horsens is also home to professional basketball team Horsens IC who play in Basketligaen. The team plays at Forum Horsens which has a capacity of 3,300. The team has won the league 6 times most recently in 2014–15 and 2015–16 as well as winning the Danish Men&#x27;s Basketball Cup 3 times most recently in the 2014–15 season.

==Transportation==

===Rail===

Horsens is served by Horsens railway station. It is located on the Fredericia–Aarhus railway line and offers direct InterCity services to Copenhagen, Hamburg, Aarhus and Aalborg as well as regional train services to Fredericia and Aarhus.

===Road===
European route E45 runs by the city of Horsens.

==Prison==
From 1853 to 2006, the city housed the Horsens Statsfængsel prison, which held prisoners serving longer sentences. A notable prisoner was former minister of justice Peter Adler Alberti.

The last execution in peacetime in Denmark happened in the prison in 1892 when Jens Nielsen was decapitated in the courtyard.

Carl August Lorentzen was a safe cracker who became famous for his escape from the prison in 1949 when he dug a tunnel from his cell and out to freedom. When the guards discovered he was missing, they found a note from him with the words &quot;Where there is a will there is a way&quot;. Lorentzen was captured a few days later on a nearby farm.

The old run-down buildings were not fit for a modern prison. In 2006 the prison was closed and the newly built State Prison of East Jutland was opened. The new prison, which is placed near Horsens, held the mass murderer Peter Lundin for a period.

Since its closure as a prison, Horsens Statsfængsel has housed a crime and prison museum, and conference and business facilities. The prison grounds have been used for concerts. It was considered as the venue of the Eurovision Song Contest 2014, along with two other cities in Denmark.

VisitHorsens (the local tourist office) moved to the Prison in 2013 and in 2015 a hotel called SleepIn has opened in the Prison.

<text>The London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR or LC&amp;DR) was a railway company in south-eastern England. It was created on 1 August 1859, when the East Kent Railway was given parliamentary approval to change its name. Its lines ran through London, and northern and eastern Kent, to form a significant part of the Greater London commuter network. The company existed until 31 December 1922, when its assets were merged with those of other companies to form the Southern Railway as a result of the grouping determined by the Railways Act 1921.

The LCDR was always in a difficult financial situation and went bankrupt in 1867, although it was able to continue to operate. Many of the difficulties were caused by the intense competition and duplication of services with the South Eastern Railway (SER). In 1898, the LCDR agreed with the SER to share the operation of the two railways, working them as a single system, known as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, and pooling receipts, but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained separate companies, with separate shareholders, until both became constituents of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923.

&quot;The Chatham&quot;, as it was sometimes known, was often criticised for its lamentable carriage stock and poor punctuality, something which Somerset Maugham refers to in the novel Mrs Craddock: &quot;Suddenly she thought of going away there and then... But there were no trains: the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway has perhaps saved many an elopement&quot;. However, in two respects the LCDR was very enterprising: it used the highly effective Westinghouse air brake on its passenger stock, and the Sykes &quot;Lock and Block&quot; system of signalling. As a result, it had an excellent safety record.

==History==
===East Kent Railway===

The LCDR originated through the dissatisfaction felt by the inhabitants and businesses of towns in north and east Kent with the services provided by the SER, resulting in the formation of the East Kent Railway (EKR). Permission to build a new line from Strood near Rochester to Faversham was granted by Parliament in 1853, but the SER successfully fought off an attempt by the new company to secure running powers on its tracks. In return, the SER agreed not to oppose any future application for an extension of the line to Dover, which was granted in 1855.

It took the EKR several years to raise the necessary finance and it was not until 25 January 1858 that the first section of the line from to Faversham was opened, with stations at Rainham, Sittingbourne, Teynham, and Faversham. On 29 March 1858, a second section opened, from Strood to Chatham. Around July 1858, a station opened at &quot;New Brompton&quot; (renamed &quot;New Brompton (Gillingham)&quot; in May 1886 and Gillingham from 1 October 1912). Rochester station opened after the rival SER opened Chatham Central station.

On 3 March 1858, the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway (WELCPR) opened the extension of its line from Norwood (Crystal Palace) to Beckenham Junction (opened as Beckenham) and Shortlands (opened as Bromley).

On 22 November 1858, the Mid-Kent Railway constructed a line from New Beckenham to Beckenham Junction station and obtained running rights over the WELCPR to Bromley (Shortlands). From there the Crays Company was building a line on to Bromley South (opened as Bromley Common) and Bickley (opened as Southborough Road). The Mid Kent line connected with the WELCPR that later provided the essential access to London. After absorbing the Crays Company and gaining running rights over the Mid Kent metals to Beckenham Junction, the LCDR later bought the track between Beckenham Junction, Birkbeck and Bromley Junction, while the LBSCR absorbed the rest of the WELCPR.

In 1859, the EKR changed its name to the LCDR, although Dover had not then been reached, coinciding with the Western Extension via Longfield to join the Crays Company rails at Southborough Road (now Bickley).

==Insolvency==
===Background===
Parliament had established standard clauses that were included in the authorising acts of Parliament for all railway companies that specifically limited the borrowing powers of the company to one-third of its authorised share capital to ensure there was a proper balance between share capital and loans. These standard clauses also required that before any loans could be taken, all of the share capital must have been subscribed for, at least 50% paid for and the payment proved to the satisfaction of a justice of the peace.

The railway construction partnership Peto and Betts had done a lot of work already for the LCDR, some of it via a close but separate partnership between Sir Morton Peto, Edward Betts, and Thomas Russell Crampton, the engineer for the LCDR. This new partnership, Peto, Betts and Crampton, in conjunction with the original partnership, Peto and Betts, agreed to build a line between London Bridge and Victoria for the LCDR and to be paid entirely in the company&#x27;s shares and debentures.

===Immediate cause of the insolvency===
From its inception, the LCDR was known to be under capitalized. With the collapse of the bank Overend, Gurney and Company in May 1866, it became apparent that the LCDR had been funding its construction by operating a series of schemes to evade the loan restriction requirements and borrow money that was not secured in the way the law required.

Shares had been issued in the names of Peto, Betts, Crampton and their acquaintances, and the LCDR accounts written up to make it look as though either the associated cash payment had been made directly to Peto and Betts to fund the construction of the line, or the money, having been paid to the railway company, had temporarily been lent back to the new shareholders. In fact, no cash had changed hands at all, but on the strength of these fictitious entries, the statutory declaration was made before a justice of the peace and authority given to raise loans.

Once these major irregularities were exposed, the financial markets refused to continue lending to the LCDR and it became insolvent.

===Samuel Morton Peto===
In December 1863 Samuel Morton Peto, a partner in Peto and Betts, had joined the board of the LCDR as financial advisor. With the collapse of the company the accusation was made that Peto was party to the scheme to circumvent the loan restrictions.

At the time of the LCDR insolvency Peto was the Liberal Member of Parliament for Bristol, and on 22 October 1866 addressed a meeting in Bristol to explain his involvement with the LCDR. Although reports of the meeting are very complimentary and sympathetic to Peto, further contemporary analysis was less so.

At the Bristol meeting, Peto was quite open with his admission that his business, Peto and Betts, was party to a scheme where they would give the LCDR a receipt for money paid to them as contractors, and the LCDR gave Peto and Betts a counter-receipt for money paid &quot;for deposit, and in anticipation of calls.&quot; It was made to appear that share capital had been paid which had not been paid. On the strength of these fictitious receipts, again, the statutory declaration was made before a justice of the peace and authority given to raise loans.

However, Peto did not consider himself in any way to be at any fault. In his view, as it was the LCDR company solicitors that had suggested this course of action, and had drawn up the fraudulent statutory declaration and the loan documentation papers, he did not think that he should shoulder any of the blame. When they heard how Peto had implicated them, the company solicitors retorted that they had never done anything of the kind, and that they regarded any attempt to borrow money, except on the basis of &quot;a bona fide subscription and a bona fide payment of half the capital,&quot; as &quot;utterly indefensible.&quot;

Peto&#x27;s attitudes were not unique. One of his supporters (and himself a railway director and deputy chairman) made a statement to the meeting to the effect that railway boards of directors cannot afford to be too nice, &quot;It is very difficult to make a railway out of nothing … Parliamentary requirements almost necessitate the doing of things which are not strictly right and proper.&quot;

===Financial market reaction===
Financial commentators were scandalised. Typical of the comments published were:

Of course, we may expect to hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto&#x27;s apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an experienced man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company&#x27;s solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.

Whom shall we in future trust? Here is Sir Morton Peto, saying expressly, ‘These debentures are not debentures; I do not know what they are, but debentures they are not. I got money on them, it is true, but they are not worth anything. They are only quasi things, and the good debentures are elsewhere.’ We have never seen the whole basis of railway credit so rudely shaken. We could not have believed that such a defence could have been offered. How is Lombard-street ever to rely on having good debentures, when it finds men of the greatest repute and the highest standing offering it documents so very like debentures, but after all not real? ... Of course the company was primarily responsible; but Sir Morton Peto was acting as their trusted financial agent, ... and therefore he must be held responsible, not of course exclusively, but conjointly with those with whom he acted.&quot;

===Aftermath===
The LCDR was refinanced. The original shareholders lost their investment and the board of directors and company solicitors replaced. The new board resolved to pursue Peto, Betts and Crampton and made a &quot;staggering&quot; claim against them personally for £6,661,941 19s 1d. (equivalent to £ as of ).

Peto, Betts and Crampton admitted to owing the LCDR £365,000 and eventually the railway acquiesced to this figure. The railway&#x27;s new solicitors declared, &quot;Whether my clients had a proof upon the proceedings for £360,000 or for £6,600,000, the result would, unfortunately be the same – in neither case would there be any dividend.&quot; The Pall Mall Gazette commented, &quot;… the chase was costly and the game worthless.&quot;

The personal reputations of Peto and Betts were destroyed and never recovered. Although also made personally bankrupt, Crampton came out of the episode with his reputation intact and continued in business.

==Formation of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway==
On 1 January 1899, the &quot;South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee&quot; was formed to oversee joint working. On 5 August 1899, the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railways Act 1899 (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. clxviii) was passed, which resulted in the formation of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&amp;CR). This was not a true merger since each company kept its individual board of directors within the organisation.

The rolling stock and steamboats of the two companies were thereafter worked as one concern. Some rationalisation of competing stations occurred but it was not fully resolved. Between 1902 and 1904, connections were built to allow LCDR trains through running on ex-SER lines, notably in the Bickley area where the two main lines crossed. The rationalisation of the lines in Thanet to create a line which ran through from Margate via Ramsgate to Minster did not take place until after the grouping. In 1936 the former tunnel to Ramsgate Harbour became part of the Tunnel Railway underground railway system linking Ramsgate beach to Hereson Road, near mainline station.

In 1923, the LCDR and the South Eastern Railway (SER), the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR), and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) were joined to form the Southern Railway.

==Line details==
;Principal engineering works
* Blackfriars Bridge: long
* Grosvenor Bridge: 
* Viaduct carrying extension to Blackfriars: 742 brick arches, 94 girder bridges

;Steepest gradient
* Rochester Bridge — Sole Street: at 1:100 (1%)

;Tunnels
* Lydden, or Shepherd&#x27;s Well Tunnel: 
* Penge Tunnel, adjacent to Sydenham Hill: – this was allegedly Queen Victoria&#x27;s least favourite tunnel

;Locomotive Works
* The locomotive works were at Longhedge, in Battersea, and the old erecting shop can still be seen. The former SER works at Ashford took over locomotive building for the joint concern, but some building work at Longhedge continued in use for a few years. The London, Chatham and Dover Railway Tavern, in nearby Cabul Road, is widely regarded as having the longest traditional pub name in Britain.

==Rolling stock==
Both the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railway companies&#x27; locomotives were painted black each with their own style of lining but, when taken over by the South Eastern and Chatham Railways Managing Committee (SE&amp;CR), dark green was adopted with an elaborate lining scheme. After some trials with a hybrid colour scheme (SER maroon on the upper parts and LC&amp;DR teak on the lower), the SE&amp;CR adopted the dark maroon/lake livery for passenger stock. Ex-LC&amp;DR locomotives were renumbered by adding 459 to the running numbers (i.e. locomotive No 1 became No 460, etc.); SER locomotives retained their existing numbers.

For a small and indigent company the Chatham was lucky in its locomotive engineers. After a very patchy start, with a miscellany of Cramptons and other oddities, it had two very competent engineers.

William Martley was appointed in 1860, and commissioned some very effective performers, notably the 0-4-2 well tanks of the &#x27;Scotchmen&#x27; (1866) and &#x27;Large Scotchmen&#x27; (1873) classes for the suburban services; and the &#x27;Europa&#x27; class (1873) of 2-4-0s, which ran the mail trains to and from Dover, the Chatham&#x27;s crack service.

William Kirtley came from the Midland Railway in 1874, following the death of Martley. He was the nephew of Matthew Kirtley, the Midland&#x27;s famous locomotive superintendent. Kirtley produced a series of excellent designs, robust and good performers — the A series of 0-4-4 tanks for suburban services, the B series of 0-6-0 goods engines; the T class of shunting engines; the M series of 4-4-0 express passenger engines; and a final R series of enlarged 0-4-4 tanks.

These rather than Stirling&#x27;s Ashford products formed the basis for SE&amp;CR development under Wainwright, not least because it was Robert Surtees from Longhedge who led design work for the successor organisation. The R series led to the SE&amp;CR&#x27;s R1 and subsequent H class; the Bs to the famous C class; and the Ms to the D and E classes, which in their rebuilt Maunsell form may have been the best British inside-cylinder 4-4-0s.

==Ships==
The London, Chatham and Dover Railway operated a number of steamships from 1864, when they took over Jenkins &amp; Churchward&#x27;s fleet.

<text>Jim Beam is an American brand of bourbon whiskey produced primarily at James B. Beam Distilling Co. in Clermont, Kentucky by Suntory Global Spirits.

It is one of the best-selling brands of bourbon in the world. Since 1795 (interrupted by Prohibition), seven generations of the Beam family have been involved in whiskey production for the company that produces the brand. The brand name became &quot;Jim Beam&quot; in 1943 in honor of James B. Beam, who rebuilt the business after Prohibition ended. Previously produced by the Beam family and later owned by the Fortune Brands holding company, the brand was purchased by Suntory Holdings in 2014.

==History==
During the late 18th century, members of the Böhm family, who eventually changed the spelling of their surname to &quot;Beam&quot;, emigrated from Germany and settled in Kentucky. Johannes &quot;Jacob&quot; Beam (1760–1834) was a farmer who began producing whiskey in the style that became bourbon. Jacob Beam sold his first barrels of corn whiskey around 1795, then called Old Jake Beam Sour Mash. Beam&#x27;s son David Beam (1802–1854) took on his father&#x27;s responsibilities in 1820 at age 18, expanding distribution of the family&#x27;s bourbon during the Industrial Revolution. David M. Beam (1833–1913) in 1854 moved the distillery to Nelson County to capitalize on the growing network of railroad lines connecting states. Until 1880, customers would bring their own jugs to the distillery to fill them with whiskey. In 1880, the company started bottling the product and selling it nationally under the brand name &quot;Old Tub&quot;. James Beauregard Beam (1864–1947) managed the family business before and after Prohibition, rebuilding the distillery in 1933–1934 in Clermont, Kentucky, near his Bardstown home.

In 1943, the brand name was changed from &quot;Old Tub&quot; to &quot;Jim Beam&quot;, after James Beauregard Beam, and some of the bottle labels bear the statement, &quot;None Genuine Without My Signature&quot; with the signature James B. Beam. In 1945, the company was purchased by Harry Blum, a Chicago spirits merchant. The Beam company was purchased by American Brands in 1968. T. Jeremiah Beam (1899–1977) started working at the Clear Springs distillery in 1913, later becoming the master distiller and overseeing operations at the new Clermont facility. Jeremiah Beam eventually gained full ownership and opened a second distillery near Boston, Kentucky, in 1954. Jeremiah later teamed up with childhood friend Jimberlain Joseph Quinn, to expand the enterprise.

Booker Noe (Frederick Booker Noe II, 1929–2004), grandson of Jim Beam, was the Master Distiller at the Jim Beam Distillery for more than 40 years, working closely with Master Distiller Jerry Dalton. In 1987 Booker introduced his namesake bourbon, Booker&#x27;s, the company&#x27;s first uncut, straight-from-the-barrel bourbon, and the first of the company&#x27;s &quot;Small Batch Bourbon Collection&quot;. Fred Noe (Frederick Booker Noe III, 1957–) became the seventh generation Beam family distiller in 2007 and regularly travels for promotional purposes.

In 1987, Jim Beam purchased National Distillers, acquiring brands including Old Crow, Bourbon de Luxe, Old Taylor, Old Grand-Dad, and Sunny Brook. Old Taylor was subsequently sold to the Sazerac Company. Jim Beam was part of the holding company formerly known as Fortune Brands that was dismantled in 2011. Other parts of the remaining company were spun off as an IPO on the NYSE on the same day, as Fortune Brands Home &amp; Security, and the liquor division of the holding company was renamed Beam, Inc. on October 4, 2011. In 2014 Beam Inc. was purchased by Suntory Holdings Ltd., a Japanese food and beverage group. The combined company was known as Beam Suntory until May 2024, when it was re-branded as Suntory Global Spirits.

On August 4, 2003, a fire destroyed a Jim Beam aging warehouse in Bardstown, Kentucky. It held 15,000 barrels () of bourbon. Flames rose more than 100 feet from the structure. Burning bourbon spilled from the warehouse into a nearby creek. An estimated 19,000 fish died of the bourbon in the creek and a river. On July 3, 2019, another warehouse caught ablaze which destroyed around 45,000 barrels () of bourbon. The fire led to the spillage of bourbon into the Kentucky River and Glenns Creek. Learning from the 2003 fire it was decided not to use water, letting it burn itself out to reduce runoff into the ecosystem. The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC) released a statement via their official Facebook page stating the alcohol plume had reached between Owenton and Carrollton. The KEEC along with local and federal agencies used aeration to increase the oxygen levels in the water to prevent additional fish kill.

In 2017, White Coffee Corp partnered with Jim Beam and a line of bourbon flavored coffees was created.

Jim Beam Black also won a Gold Outstanding medal at the 2013 International Wine and Spirit Competition.

==Process==
Bourbon whiskey distillers must follow government standards for production. By law (), any &quot;straight&quot; bourbon must be: produced in the United States; made of a grain mix of at least 51% corn; distilled at no higher than 160 proof (80% ABV); free of any additives (except water to reduce proof for aging and bottling); aged in new, charred oak barrels; entered into the aging barrels at no higher than 125 proof (62.5% ABV), aged for a minimum of 2 years, and bottled at no less than 80 proof (40% ABV).

Jim Beam starts with water filtered naturally by the limestone shelf found in Central Kentucky. A strain of yeast used since the end of Prohibition is added to a tank with the grains to create what is known as &quot;dona yeast&quot;, used later in the fermentation process. Hammermills grind the mix of corn, rye and barley malt to break it down for easier cooking. The mix is then moved into a large mash cooker where water and set back are added. The &quot;set back&quot; is a portion of the old mash from the previous distillation—the key step of the sour mash process, ensuring consistency from batch to batch. The distillery produces two different whiskeys based on two different mash bills, each used depending on the product line.

From the cooker, the mash heads to the fermenter where it is cooled to and yeast is added again. The yeast is fed by the sugars in the mash, producing heat, carbon dioxide and alcohol. Called &quot;distiller&#x27;s beer&quot; or &quot;wash&quot;, the resulting liquid (after filtering to remove solids) looks, smells and tastes like (and essentially is) a form of beer. The wash is pumped into a column still where it is heated to over , causing the alcohol to turn to a vapor.

The high wine at about 125 proof is moved to new charred American oak barrels, each of which hold about of liquid. A &quot;bung&quot; is used to seal the barrels before moving them to nearby hilltop rackhouses where they will age up to nine years. As the seasons change, natural weather variations expand and contract the barrel wood, allowing bourbon to seep into the barrel, and the caramelized sugars from the charred oak flavor and color the bourbon. A significant portion (known as the &quot;angel&#x27;s share&quot;) of the bourbon escapes the barrel through evaporation, or stays trapped in the wood of the barrel. Jim Beam ages for at least four years, or twice as long as the government requires for a &quot;straight&quot; bourbon. Aging for at least four years also allows the distillery to legally dispense with an age statement on the bottle.

==Global markets==
Jim Beam is one of the best-selling brands of bourbon in the world. Outside the United States, Beam Global Spirits &amp; Wine has had a sales and distribution alliance with The Edrington Group since 2009.

<text>Striking the colors—meaning lowering the flag (the &quot;colors&quot;) that signifies a ship&#x27;s or garrison&#x27;s allegiance—is a universally recognized indication of surrender, particularly for ships at sea. For a ship, surrender is dated from the time the ensign is struck.

==In international law==

&quot;Colours. A national flag (or a battle ensign). The colours... are hauled down as a token of submission.&quot;

International law absolutely requires a ship of war to fly its ensign at the commencement of any hostile acts, i.e., before firing on the enemy. During battle there is no purpose in striking the colors other than to indicate surrender.

It was and is an offense to continue to fight after striking one&#x27;s colors, and an offense to continue to fire on an enemy after she has struck her colors, unless she indicates by some other action, such as continuing to fire or seeking to escape, that she has not truly surrendered. For this reason, striking the colors is conclusive evidence of a surrender having taken place in the case of a warship, but not in the case of a merchant ship. What would be perfidy in the case of a warship is not in the case of a merchant ship: a merchant ship may strike its colors as a &quot;ruse de guerre&quot; in an attempt to escape capture, since it does not engage the enemy in combat.

In distinction to striking one&#x27;s colors, hoisting a white flag, in itself, is not an indication of surrender. Rather, hoisting a white flag indicates a request for a truce in order to communicate with the enemy. Under the Geneva Conventions, persons carrying or waving a white flag are still not to be fired upon, nor are they allowed to open fire.

==Understood meaning==


Nailing the colors to the mast is a traditional sign of defiance, indicating that the colors will never be struck, that the ship will never surrender. On 23 September 1779, Capt. Richard Pearson of HMS &quot;Serapis&quot;, nailed the British ensign to the ensign staff with his own hands before going into battle against Continental Navy ship &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;. Later, after &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;&#x27;s ensign was shot away, Pearson asked Capt. John Paul Jones of &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; to confirm he had struck his colors. However, Jones denied it and the battle continued.

In 1807, the captain of &quot;Chesapeake&quot; refused to allow inspection of his ship for deserters. Consequently, HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; opened fire. Ten minutes later &quot;Chesapeake&quot; struck her colors as a token of surrender. Her log recorded &quot;Having... haul&#x27;d down our Colours.&quot;

Almost exactly six years later, when the United States had declared war on Great Britain, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; engaged &quot;Shannon&quot; outside Boston in the only equal match of that war. Following a brief exchange of gunfire, 21 of the British crew boarded and took control of &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. Since most of the American crew had fled belowdecks, the British sailors pulled down &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s flag themselves.

In 1811, while the United States and Great Britain were at peace with each other, U.S. frigate &quot;President&quot; engaged HM sloop of war &quot;Little Belt&quot;. John Rodgers, Captain of &quot;President&quot; reported to the Secretary of the Navy, that &quot;when perceiving our opponent&#x27;s Gaff &amp; Colours down... I... embraced the earliest moment to stop our fire and prevent the further effusion of blood.&quot;

On 29 July 1812, at the start of the War of 1812, Lt. William M. Crane, USN, commanding officer of U.S. brig &quot;Nautilus&quot;, reported his capture by a British squadron in these words: &quot;the chasing ship put her helm up hoisted a broad pendant and English colours and ranged under my lee quarter—unable to resist I was compelled to strike the Flag of the United States.&quot;

Captain David Porter, USN, of U.S. frigate &quot;Essex&quot; reported the capture of HM brig &quot;Alert&quot; on 13 August 1812 in these words: &quot;He avoided the dreadful consequences that our broad side would in a few moments have produced by prudentially striking his colours.&quot;

On 19 August 1812, the U.S. frigate &quot;Constitution&quot; chased HM frigate &quot;Guerriere&quot;. &quot;...it being now dark we could not see whether she had any colours, flying or not...[so I sent an officer under] a flag [of truce] to see whether she had surrendered or not.&quot; Captain James Richard Dacres, RN, of &quot;Guerriere&quot; reported the surrender of his ship, &quot;When calling my few remaining officers together, they were all of opinion that any further resistance would be a needless waste of lives, I order&#x27;d, though reluctantly, the Colours to be struck.&quot;

The Journal of HMS &quot;Poictiers&quot; reports the capture of U.S. sloop of war &quot;Wasp&quot; on 18 October 1812 as follows: &quot;Fired Several Shot at the chase, Observed [chase] hoist American Colours... Shortnd sail, the chase having Struck her colours.&quot;

Captain William Bainbridge, USN, reported a battle of HM frigate &quot;Java&quot; with USS &quot;Constitution&quot; on 29 December 1812, &quot;...Got very close to the enemy in a very [effective] raking position, athwart his bows &amp; was at the very instance of raking him, when he most prudently Struck his Flag.&quot; Lt. Henry D. Chads, RN, of &quot;Java&quot;, reported her surrender, &quot;At 5:50 our Colours were lowered from the Stump of the Mizen Mast and we were taken possession a little after 6.&quot;

U.S. sloop of war &quot;Hornet&quot; engaged HM brig sloop &quot;Peacock&quot; on 24 February 1813. Badly damaged and sinking, &quot;Peacock&quot;, signalled her surrender by lowering her ensign, As a signal of distress, she then hoisted an ensign upside down. Since the loss of rigging hindered visibility, her senior surviving officer made another sign, &quot;I was compelled... to wave my Hat in acknowledgement of having struck[,] the Ensign having fallen with the Gaff into the Water.&quot;

<text>Korsør is a town in Zealand, Denmark. It is located in Slagelse Municipality. Until 2007 Korsør was the seat of Korsør Municipality. The town is located west of Slagelse, north-west of Skælskør and connects to Nyborg through the Great Belt Bridge.

Formerly the main ferry port from Zealand to Funen, the town of Korsør is divided into two halves by the Korsør Nor inlet, with the northern part named Halsskov. Most of the historical southern part of Korsør (Korsør proper) is low-lying and prone to flooding.

==Culture==
The Korsør Biograf Teater, which opened in August , is the world&#x27;s oldest movie theater in continuous use that is still operating.

==Sights==
Korsør Mini Town (Danish: &quot;Korsør Miniby&quot;) is a miniature model of the town of Korsør as it looked in 1875. It is built in 1:10 scale and has existed since 2001.

Tårnborg is a manor located in Halsskov in Korsør. Tårnborg was originally a village, in which a castle was built in the 1100s. It was referred to as Korsør Castle and later came under the name of Dyrehovedgaard. It was renamed to Tårnborg in 1846. The manor owns 334 acres.

===Korsør Fortification===
Korsør Fortification (Danish: &quot;Korsør Fæstning&quot;) is a set of fortifications located centrally in Korsør. It was built in the 1100s. Today there are five buildings on the fortifications, though all are built at different times and only the tower originates from the castle that was located on the fortification. The tower is from the 1200s.

Korsør City and Strait Crossing Museum (Danish: &quot;Korsør By og Overfartsmuseum&quot;) is a museum located in Korsør. The museum was founded in 1983, and is focussed on the strait crossing from Korsør to Nyborg. The museum is located in a building on Korsør Fortification.

<doc id="823563" wikidata="Q216869" url="?curid=823563" title="Gran Sasso d'Italia">
<text>Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia (; ) is a massif in the Apennine Mountains of Italy. Its highest peak, Corno Grande , is the highest mountain in the Apennines, and the second-highest mountain in Italy outside the Alps. The mountain lies within Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park.

==Geography==
The three main summits of the Gran Sasso are Corno Grande, which at is the highest peak in the Apennines, nearby &quot;Corno Piccolo&quot;, and &quot;Pizzo d&#x27;Intermesoli&quot;, which is separated from the other two peaks by Val Maone, a deep valley. Corno Grande and Corno Piccolo&#x27;s ash coloration come from their limestone and dolomite composition. The peaks are snow-covered for much of the year though the snow cover appears to be less each decade. Corno Piccolo is referred to as, &quot;The Sleeping Giant&quot;. This is due to the appearance of a profile of a reclined face. This view of Corno Piccolo is evident when viewing the mountain from Pietracamela, a small town near Prati di Tivo, on the north side of the mountain. Corno Grande and Corno Piccolo with their rough vertical walls provide serious rock climbers with challenges.

Situated below the peak of the Corno Grande is the Calderone glacier, although deglaciation has significantly reduced the glacier&#x27;s size. Glaciologists now question whether the glacier will survive past 2030.

The mid- to lower slopes of the Gran Sasso are grazed in spring, summer and autumn by large flocks of sheep guarded by Maremmano-Abruzzese sheepdogs as well as herds of cattle and semi-wild horses. The pastures are covered with field grasses and meadowland wildflowers. The park is also the habitat for diverse wildlife from rare species such as the Apennine wolf, the Marsican bear, European wildcat and the Abruzzo chamois (&quot;Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata&quot;), a variety of chamois at the very edge of extinction but now making a comeback in the park through a joint effort by WWF Italia and the park administration. Other species of wildlife include wild boar, foxes, grass snakes such as Orsini&#x27;s viper, and a wide variety of bird life including golden eagles, peregrine falcons, goshawks, ortolan buntings, rock sparrows, crested larks, red-backed shrikes and downy pipits.

At the northern base of Corno Piccolo is Prati di Tivo, a ski village. To the east of Corno Grande and Corno Piccolo lies Campo Imperatore, a and high plain or plateau at about height. Campo Imperatore is home to Italy&#x27;s oldest continuously operating commercial ski area (connected to Fonte Cerreto via cable car).

==History==
Hotel Campo Imperatore in Gran Sasso was Benito Mussolini&#x27;s prison until his freeing in September 1943 by Nazi commandos in the Gran Sasso raid. The plateau is also the site of the Campo Imperatore station of the Rome Observatory, from which the Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey and other astronomical studies are carried out. At the southern edge of Campo Imperatore and within the bounds of the national park are three medieval hill towns once ruled by the Medicis; Calascio, which sits before the ancient fortress ruin of Rocca di Calascio, Santo Stefano di Sessanio, and Castel Del Monte.

In 2005, a peak previously named &quot;The Gendarme&quot; was renamed &quot;John Paul II Peak&quot; on what would have been Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 85th birthday. He had visited the Gran Sasso many times, saying it reminded him of the mountains of his native Poland.

In January 2017, an avalanche hit Rigopiano hotel, killing 29.

==Science==
In 1984, a two-lane highway tunnel carrying the A24 motorway, the Traforo del Gran Sasso, was bored through the Gran Sasso Massif. In 1995, a second parallel tunnel was completed. Construction of the tunnel included an underground particle physics laboratory at Assergi, the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso or &quot;Gran Sasso National Laboratory&quot;. The first large experiments there started in 1989.

The laboratory is composed of three large underground chambers, sometimes referred to collectively as the third tunnel, and lies beneath of rock. Construction of the laboratory and second tunnel faced opposition from Italian and international environmental groups including Pro-Natura International, LIPU and Club Alpino Italiano, as well as the World Wide Fund for Nature, Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth. Environmentalists noted that the nuclear physics laboratory would lie on or near two major and highly active seismic faults, that construction of the tunnels would interfere with a major aquifer, and that construction waste would degrade an environmentally sensitive and significant area. Many credit the opposition created by the tunnel and laboratory construction with galvanizing the Italian environmental movement and leading to the creation of the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park in 1991. In recent years, the laboratory has itself begun promoting preservation of the Gran Sasso environment.

Because of its low background radiation, the underground laboratory is used for experiments in particle and nuclear physics, including the study of neutrinos, high-energy cosmic rays, dark matter, nuclear decay, as well as the study of geology, and biology. The laboratory employs over 700 scientists from twenty different countries. The LNGS was the destination of the neutrinos involved in the faster-than-light neutrino anomaly publicly announced in September 2011 and retracted in July 2012. In the summer of 2014 the facility was instrumental in confirming previous theories about the Sun&#x27;s main source of energy, when proton-to-proton fusion-produced neutrinos were detected and measured, virtually at the Sun&#x27;s core.

==Tourism==
The Gran Sasso is located in the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park. Running through this nature preserve is a portion of the Italian State Highway 80 (SS80), known as the Grand Highway of the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park (&quot;Strada maestra del Parco&quot;).

While frequented by skiers in winter, and mountain climbers and hikers in other seasons, the Gran Sasso is remarkably free of tourists despite its proximity to Rome and the events of the Gran Sasso raid that took place there in 1943. This is especially true in summer with most Italians preferring beach vacations and foreign visitors more likely to visit the mountains of northern Italy.

Pope John Paul II loved to secretly ski at Gran Sasso where he would retire often and pray at the church of San Pietro della Ienca. When he died Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, gave the local Abruzzo community some of the late pontiff&#x27;s blood as a token of the love he had felt for the mountainous area.

The Shrine of Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows at Isola del Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia with average of two million visitors per year is one of the 15 most visited sanctuaries in the world.

Acclaimed international movies shot at Gran Sasso include Jean-Jacques Annaud&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s &quot;Red Sonja&quot;, &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;, &quot;King David&quot;, &quot;Keoma&quot; and &quot;The Barbarians&quot;.

<text>Thisted Municipality () is a &quot;kommune&quot; in North Jutland Region, Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 1,072 km², and has a total population of 42,989 (2024). The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Thisted.

On 1 January 2007 Thisted municipality was, as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007), merged with Hanstholm and Sydthy municipalities to form a new Thisted municipality.

== Locations ==
==Thy==
Thisted municipality is roughly identical with the traditional district of Thy, except that the municipality includes a small portion of the district Hanherred, but not the southernmost peninsula of Thy, Thyholm.

==Potential name change==
In November 2023, the municipal council voted, by 17 to 10, to advance with a proposal to change the name of the municipality to Thy Municipality. The next step is to have a feel among the citizens to see whether it should be changed. A final decision is set to take place on February 27, 2024.
==Politics==

===Municipal council===
Thisted&#x27;s municipal council consists of 27 members, elected every four years.

Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

== Notable people ==

* Niels Andersen (1835 in Ydby, Thisted County - 1911) a Danish businessman and politician; created the first large construction company in Denmark; lived in Søholm from 1877 
* Andreas Riis Carstensen (1844 in Sennels, near Thisted – 1906) a Danish painter who specialized in maritime scenes, notably of Greenland.
* Johan Skjoldborg (1861 in Øsløs in Thisted – 1936) a Danish educator, novelist, playwright and memoirist
* Andrew Petersen (1870 near Thisted – 1953) was a patternmaker, foundry company executive and politician in New York City
* Aage Oxenvad (1884 in Gettrup near Thisted – 1944) a Danish clarinetist who played in the Royal Danish Orchestra from 1909

<text>The Cimetière parisien de Pantin (sometimes known as cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny) is one of the three Parisien cemeteries &quot;extra muros&quot;, located in the commune of Pantin which is in Seine-Saint-Denis, Île-de-France.

==History==
The cemetery was opened on November 15, 1886. Pantin is one of the three Parisien Cemeteries &quot;extra muros&quot;, the others being Cimetière parisien de Thiais (opened in 1929) and Cimetière parisien de Bagneux (also opened in 1886).

Since its opening, one million people have been buried in the cemetery, with nearly 5,000 interments taking place annually.

==Notes==
Pantin is the largest cemetery of Paris, both in number of graves and land area. It is also the largest cemetery in France. Pantin is a garden style burial ground with more than 8,000 trees and streets (a network of 32 kilometers of roads) that allow access by (motor) vehicles.

It has nearly 200,000 graves, grouped in 180 divisions. The cemetery of Pantin is a vast necropolis. The oldest graves are in the first seventeen divisions.

Many of the burials are from the Jewish community (France has the largest Jewish community in Europe) and more recently from the Chinese Buddhist community.

Marthe Erbelding was buried here (her grave was cleared in 1960). Erbelding was an 11-year-old girl who was raped and murdered by a friend of her parents in 1907. The details of this gruesome crime were widely reported on. As a result the abolition of capital punishment was delayed for another 60 years.

Ilan Halimi, the young French Jew, who was kidnapped and tortured to death in 2006, was temporarily buried in Pantin before being reburied in &quot;Har HaMenuchot&quot; cemetery in Israel on February 9, 2007.

It is one of the least known of the many Parisian cemeteries. The cemetery is a socio-economic reflection of the past decades, with graves for both rich and poor. It has been mentioned in songs such as Vincent Delerm&#x27;s &quot;Les Trottoirs à l’envers&quot;, Pierre Perret&#x27;s &quot;Ils s’aimaient&quot; and Mano Solo&#x27;s &quot;Le Monde Entier&quot;.

In July 1973, one hundred Jewish tombstones were desecrated at the cemetery. In addition, some 60 Stars of David were either defaced or smeared.

==Notable interments==

==Location==
The main entrance to the Cimetière parisien de Pantin is on 164 Avenue Jean Jaurès (it is actually on Avenue du Cimetière Parisien), in Pantin (one of the banlieu of Paris). There is also a gate named Porte de Petits Points on Avenue du Général Leclerc (near the junction with Chemin des Vignes). There are two other gates, Porte de Pailleux and Porte d&#x27;Illustration, but these are only open on Rosh Hashanah and All Saints&#x27; Day. The cemetery is located next to Fort d&#x27;Aubervilliers.

<text>The Sortes Astrampsychi (Oracles of Astrampsychus) was a popular Greco-Roman fortune-telling guide ascribed to Astrampsychus, identified by ancient authors as a magus who lived in Persia before the conquest of Alexander the Great, or an Egyptian sage serving a Ptolemaic king. While other sortes (means of fortune-telling) involved the casting of dice, the &quot;Sortes Astrampsychi&quot; did not. Instead, a questioner chose a prewritten question, to which a number was assigned; calling on divine inspiration, the questioner then spoke a number from one to ten, which was added to the question number; the oracle-monger then provided one of ten possible replies by consulting a numerical index. The text is known from thirteen papyrus fragments of the third to sixth centuries CE, and from Byzantine manuscripts which date from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries but are completely preserved. The Byzantine texts add Christian religious elements.

In a preface to the &quot;Sortes&quot;, the author, identifying himself as &quot;Astrampsychus of Egypt&quot; and addressing his remarks &quot;to King Ptolemy,&quot; goes on to claim that the book was actually &quot;an invention of Pythagoras the philosopher,&quot; and boasts that &quot;King Alexander of Macedon ruled the world by using this method of deciding matters.&quot;

A number of later treatises have been spuriously ascribed to Astrampsychus, including a book on healing donkeys, a guide for interpreting dreams, a discussion of lapidary stones for use in astrology, a work on geomancy, and a volume of love charms.

The first English translation of the &quot;Sortes Astrampsychi&quot; by Stewart and Morrell was published in 1998 as &quot;The Oracles of Astrampsychus&quot; in &quot;Anthology of Ancient Greek Popular Literature&quot;; the editor, William Hansen, provides an introduction with details about the history of the document and instructions for its use. In 2006 an edition of the Greek text with a German translation by Kai Brodersen was published as &quot;Astrampsychos: Das Pythagoras-Orakel&quot;.

<doc id="823693" wikidata="Q3547441" url="?curid=823693" title="USS Ranger (1777)">
<text>USS &quot;Ranger&quot; was a sloop-of-war in the Continental Navy, serving from 1777 to 1780 and the first to bear her name. Built at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on Badger&#x27;s Island in Kittery, Maine, she is famed for the solo raiding campaign carried out by her first captain, John Paul Jones, during naval operations of the American Revolutionary War. In six months spent primarily in British waters, she captured five prizes (mostly merchantmen), staged a single failed attack on the English mainland at Whitehaven, and caused Royal Navy ships to be dispatched against her in the Irish Sea.

Jones was detached in Brest, France to take charge of the , turning over responsibility for &quot;Ranger&quot; to his first officer, Lieutenant Thomas Simpson. Under Simpson, the &quot;Ranger&quot; went on to capture an additional twenty-four prizes across the Atlantic and along the U.S. coast throughout 1778 and 1779.

Receiving new orders in late 1779 to aid the American garrison at Charleston, South Carolina, during the British siege, she continued her raiding career until ultimately forced to anchor on the Cooper River, resulting in her capture on 11 May 1780, with the fall of the city. Renamed &quot;Halifax&quot;, she finished her active service as a Royal Navy ship and was decommissioned in 1781. Later that year, she was sold in Portsmouth, England to private buyers for use as a merchantman.

==History==
&quot;Ranger&quot; (initially called &quot;Hampshire&quot;) was launched on May 10, 1777 by James Hackett, master shipbuilder, at the shipyard of John Langdon on what is now called Badger&#x27;s Island in Kittery, Maine. Captain John Paul Jones was named her first commander.

===Continental Navy===
After fitting out, she sailed for France on November 1, 1777, carrying dispatches telling of General Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender to the commissioners in Paris. On the voyage over, two British prizes were captured. &quot;Ranger&quot; arrived at Nantes, France, on December 2, where Jones sold the prizes and delivered the news of the victory at Saratoga to ambassador Benjamin Franklin. On February 14, 1778, &quot;Ranger&quot; received a nine-gun salute to the new American flag, the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; from the ship of the line &quot;Robuste&quot;, under Lamotte-Picquet, at Quiberon Bay. This was the first salute from a warship and, the second to an American fighting vessel by a foreign power (the first salute was received by when on November 16, 1776 she arrived at St. Eustatius and the Dutch island returned her 11-gun salute).

&quot;Ranger&quot; sailed from Brest April 10, 1778, for the Irish Sea and four days later captured the brigantine &quot;Dolphin&quot; between the Scilly Isles and Cape Clear and scuttled it. On 16 April, she took ship &quot;Lord Chatham&quot; 5 leagues from Cape Clear and sent her to Brest, France. On the 19th sunk a Scottish coastal schooner in the Mull of Galloway. On the 20th sunk a sloop. Captain Jones led a raid on the English port of Whitehaven, April 23, spiking the guns of the fortress, but failing in his attempt to burn the ships in the harbor. Sailing across the bay to St. Mary&#x27;s Isle, Scotland, the American captain planned to seize the Earl of Selkirk and hold him as a hostage and use him to make several political demands. However, since the Earl was absent, the plan failed. Several Royal Navy vessels were searching for &quot;Ranger&quot;, and Captain Jones sailed across the North Channel to Carrickfergus, Ireland, to induce of 14 guns, to come out and fight. &quot;Drake&quot; came out slowly against the wind and tide, and, after an hour&#x27;s battle, the battered &quot;Drake&quot; struck her colors, with eight sailors being killed in action during the engagement on the 24th. Later on the same day she captured the brigantine &quot;Patience&quot;. Having made temporary repairs, and with a prize crew on &quot;Drake&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot; continued around the west coast of Ireland, capturing a lone storeship, and arrived at Brest with her prizes on May 8.

Captain Jones was detached to command , leaving Lieutenant Simpson, his first officer, in command. &quot;Ranger&quot; departed Brest on August 21, reaching Portsmouth, New Hampshire on October 15, in company with and , plus three prizes taken in the Atlantic.

The sloop departed Portsmouth on February 24, 1779 joining with the Continental Navy ships and in preying on British shipping in the North Atlantic. Seven prizes were captured early in April, and brought safely into port for sale. On 18 June, &quot;Ranger&quot; was underway again with &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;Queen of France&quot;, capturing two Jamaicamen in July and nine more vessels off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Of the 11 prizes, three were recaptured, but the remaining eight, with their cargoes, were worth over a million dollars when sold in Boston.

Underway on November 23, &quot;Ranger&quot; was ordered to Commodore Whipple&#x27;s squadron, arriving at Charleston on December 23, to support the garrison there under siege by the British. On January 24, 1780, &quot;Ranger&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot;, in a short cruise down the coast, captured three transports, loaded with supplies, near Tybee, Georgia. The British army tasked with capturing Charleston was also discovered in the area. &quot;Ranger&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot; sailed back to Charleston with the news. Shortly afterwards the British commenced the final push. Although the channel and harbor configuration made naval operations and support difficult, &quot;Ranger&quot; took a station in the Cooper River, and was captured when Charleston fell on 11 May 1780.

&quot;Ranger&quot; was taken into the British Royal Navy and commissioned under the name HMS &quot;Halifax&quot;. She was decommissioned in Portsmouth, England, in 1781, then sold as a merchant vessel for about 3 percent of her original cost.

<text>Fréhel (; born Marguerite Boulc&#x27;h (); 13 July 1891 – 3 February 1951) was a French singer and actress.

==Biography==

Born in Paris to a poor and dysfunctional Breton family, Marguerite Boulc&#x27;h was a child left to a life on the streets in the sordid side of Paris. In her teens, she got a break when she met one of the female music-hall performers who heard her sing and introduced her to show business promoters.

She began performing under the stage name Pervenche, and soon met and married Robert Hollard, a performer who used the nom de guerre &quot;Roberty&quot;. Alcohol entered her life at an early age and her drinking became a problem for her husband. Their marriage did not last long and her husband left her for another Parisian singer, Damia. Fréhel then began a relationship with Maurice Chevalier but that too did not last long and after he left her for the much older megastar Mistinguett. At 19 years old, she attempted suicide.

Following her suicide attempt, in 1913 she tried to escape her pain and travelled to Bucharest, Turkey and then to Russia where she remained for more than ten years. She suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction, and returned to Paris in 1922. She then signaled a new beginning by switching to the stage name &quot;Fréhel&quot;, taking the name from Cap Fréhel in Brittany where her parents had been born. Singing as Fréhel, at the Paris Olympia in 1924 she gave a powerful performance and was soon headlining at the most popular venues in the country. As part of what is now referred to as the &quot;bal musette&quot;, Fréhel often sang accompanied by bagpipes and/or an accordion player.

In the 1930s, she appeared in several motion pictures, almost always portraying a singer in a minor or supporting role. The most notable films in which she performed were 1931&#x27;s &quot;Cœur de Lilas&quot;, based on the Tristan Bernard play, and &quot;Pépé le Moko&quot; that starred Jean Gabin. While her alcohol abuse continued, she nevertheless was a major show business force of 1930s France. Of all her songs, her 1939 &quot;La Java Bleue&quot;, with music by Vincent Scotto, proved her most popular.

Despite being one of Europe&#x27;s most sought-after performers, her addictions led her to drop out of public view for years. She died in 1951, alone in a hotel in Pigalle. She was interred in the Cimetière de Pantin, near Paris.

Her 1934 recording &quot;Si tu n&#x27;étais pas là&quot; was featured in the 2001 soundtrack of the film &quot;Le Fabuleux Destin d&#x27;Amélie Poulain&quot; (&quot;Amélie&quot;).

She is portrayed by Yolande Moreau in the Gainsbourg bio pic &quot;&quot; - in which she encounters the young Serge Gainsbourg and accompanies him in a song.

<doc id="823743" wikidata="Q262109" url="?curid=823743" title="Jewish Christianity">
<text>Jewish Christians were the followers of a Jewish religious sect that emerged in Judea during the late Second Temple period (first century AD). These Jews believed that Jesus was the prophesied Messiah and they continued their adherence to Jewish law. Jewish Christianity is the foundation of Early Christianity, which later developed into Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Christianity. Christianity started with Jewish eschatological expectations, and it developed into the worship of Jesus as the result of his earthly ministry, his crucifixion, and the post-crucifixion experiences of his followers. Modern scholars are engaged in an ongoing debate about the proper designation of Jesus&#x27; first followers. Many modern scholars believe that the term Jewish Christians is anachronistic given the fact that there is no consensus about the date of the birth of Christianity. Some modern scholars have suggested that the designations &quot;Jewish believers in Jesus&quot; and &quot;Jewish followers of Jesus&quot; better reflect the original context.

Jewish Christians drifted apart from mainstream Judaism. Their form of Judaism eventually became a minority strand within Judaism, and it had almost disappeared by the fifth century. Jewish–Christian gospels are lost except for fragments, so there is a considerable amount of uncertainty about the scriptures which were used by this group of Christians.

While previous scholarship viewed the First Jewish–Roman War and the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70 as the main events, more recent scholarship tends to argue that the Bar Kochba Revolt was the main factor in the separation. The split was a long-term process, in which the boundaries were not clear-cut.

==Etymology==
Early Jewish Christians (i.e. the Jewish followers of Jesus) referred to themselves as followers of &quot;The Way&quot; (: hė hodós), probably coming from , &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; According to , the term &quot;Christian&quot; () was first used in reference to Jesus&#x27;s disciples in the city of Antioch, meaning &quot;followers of Christ&quot;, by the non-Jewish inhabitants of Antioch. The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;Christianity&quot; () was by Ignatius of Antioch, around 100 AD.

The term &quot;Jewish Christian&quot; appears in modern historical texts contrasting Christians of Jewish origin with gentile Christians, both in discussion of the New Testament church and the second and following centuries.

==Origins==
===Jewish-Hellenistic background===

====Hellenism====

Christianity arose as a Pharisaic movement within the syncretist Hellenistic world of the first century AD, dominated by Roman law and Greek culture. Hellenistic culture had a profound impact on the customs and practices of Jews, both in the Land of Israel and in the Diaspora. The inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora, which sought to establish a Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition within the culture and language of Hellenism.

Hellenistic Judaism spread to Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BC and became a notable &quot;religio licita&quot; after the Roman conquest of Greece, Anatolia, Syria, Judea, and Egypt, until its decline in the 3rd century parallel to the rise of Gnosticism and Early Christianity.

According to Burton Mack and a minority of commentators, the Christian vision of Jesus&#x27;s death for the redemption of humankind was only possible in a Hellenised milieu. 

====Jewish sects====
During the early first century AD, there were many competing Jewish sects in the Holy Land, and those that became Rabbinic Judaism and Proto-orthodox Christianity were but two of these. There were Pharisees, Sadducees, and Zealots, but also other less influential sects, including the Essenes. The first century BC and first century AD saw a growing number of charismatic religious leaders contributing to what would become the Mishnah of Rabbinic Judaism; the ministry of Jesus would lead to the emergence of the first Jewish Christian community.

The Gospels contain strong condemnations of the Pharisees, though there is a clear influence of Hillel&#x27;s interpretation of the Torah in the Gospel sayings. However, certain laws followed the more stringent views of Shammai, such as regarding divorce. Belief in the resurrection of the dead in the Messianic age was a core Pharisaic doctrine.

====Jewish and Christian messianism====

Most of Jesus&#x27;s teachings were intelligible and acceptable in terms of Second Temple Judaism; what set early Christians apart from Jews was their belief that Jesus was the Messiah. While Christianity acknowledges only one ultimate Messiah, Judaism can be said to hold to a concept of multiple messiahs. The two most frequently mentioned are the Messiah ben Joseph and the Messiah ben David. Some scholars have argued that the idea of two messiahs—one &quot;suffering&quot; and the other fulfilling the traditionally conceived messianic role—was normative to ancient Judaism, predating Jesus, as can be seen from the Dead Sea Scrolls. Many would have viewed Jesus as one or both.

Jewish messianism has its root in the apocalyptic literature of the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD, promising a future &quot;anointed&quot; leader or Messiah to resurrect the Israelite &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;, in place of the foreign rulers of the time. According to Shaye J.D. Cohen, the fact that Jesus did not establish an independent Israel, combined with his death at the hands of the Romans, caused many Jews to reject him as the Messiah. Jews at that time were expecting a military leader as a Messiah, such as Bar Kokhba.

 was another source of Jewish messianism, which was prompted by Pompey&#x27;s conquest of Jerusalem in 63 BC. Early Christians cited this chapter to claim that Jesus was the Messiah and the son of god and negate Caesar&#x27;s claim to the latter. 

==Early Jewish Christianity==
Most historians agree that Jesus or his followers established a new Jewish sect, one that attracted both Jewish and gentile converts. The self-perception, beliefs, customs, and traditions of the Jewish followers of Jesus, Jesus&#x27;s disciples and first followers, were grounded in first-century Judaism. According to New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman, a number of early Christianities existed in the first century AD, from which developed various Christian traditions and denominations, including proto-orthodoxy, Marcionites, Gnostics and the Jewish followers of Jesus. According to theologian James D. G. Dunn, four types of early Christianity can be discerned: Jewish Christianity, Hellenistic Christianity, Apocalyptic Christianity, and early Catholicism.

The first followers of Jesus were essentially all ethnically Jewish or Jewish proselytes. Jesus was Jewish, preached to the Jewish people, and called from them his first followers. According to McGrath, Jewish Christians, as faithful religious Jews, &quot;regarded their movement as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief – that Jesus was the Messiah.&quot;

Conversely, Margaret Barker argues that early Christianity has roots in pre-Babylonian exile Israelite religion. The Expositor&#x27;s Greek Testament interprets as being critical of Judaism and Samaritanism. John Elliott also characterizes early Christianity as an &#x27;Israelite sect&#x27; or a &#x27;renewal movement within Israel&#x27;, where followers were called &#x27;Galileans&#x27;, &#x27;Nazarenes&#x27; or members of &#x27;the Way&#x27; by the native inhabitants of 1st century Judea.

Jewish Christians were the original members of the Jewish movement that later became Christianity. In the earliest stage the community was made up of all those Jews who believed that Jesus was the Jewish messiah. As Christianity grew and developed, Jewish Christians became only one strand of the early Christian community, characterised by combining the confession of Jesus as Christ with continued observance of the Torah and adherence to Jewish traditions such as Sabbath observance, Jewish calendar, Jewish laws and customs, circumcision, kosher diet and synagogue attendance, and by a direct genetic relationship to the earliest followers of Jesus.

===Jerusalem &quot;ekklēsia&quot;===

The Jerusalem Church was an early Christian community located in Jerusalem, of which James the Just, the brother of Jesus, and Peter were leaders. Paul was in contact with this community. Legitimised by Jesus&#x27; appearance, Peter was the first leader of the Jerusalem &quot;ekklēsia&quot;. He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, &quot;the Brother of the Lord,&quot; which may explain why the early texts contain scarce information about Peter. According to Lüdemann, in the discussions about the strictness of adherence to the Jewish Law, the more conservative view of James the Just became more widely accepted than the more liberal position of Peter, who soon lost influence. According to Dunn, this was not an &quot;usurpation of power,&quot; but a consequence of Peter&#x27;s involvement in missionary activities.

According to Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Church History&quot; 4.5.3–4: the first 15 Christian Bishops of Jerusalem were &quot;of the circumcision&quot;. The Romans destroyed the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem in year 135 during the Bar Kokhba revolt, but it is traditionally believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish–Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis.

===Beliefs===
The Pauline epistles incorporate creeds, or confessions of faith, of a belief in an exalted Christ that predate Paul, and give essential information on the faith of the early Jerusalem Church around James, brother of Jesus. This group venerated the risen Christ, who had appeared to several persons, as in Philippians 2:6–11, the Christ hymn, which portrays Jesus as an incarnated and subsequently exalted heavenly being.

====Messiah/Christ====

Early Christians regarded Jesus to be the Messiah, the promised king who would restore the Jewish kingdom and independence. Jewish messianism has its root in the apocalyptic literature of the 2nd century BC to 1st century BC, promising a future &quot;anointed&quot; leader or messiah to restore the Israelite &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;, in place of the foreign rulers of the time. This corresponded with the Maccabean Revolt directed against the Seleucid Empire. Following the fall of the Hasmonean kingdom, it was directed against the Roman administration of Judea Province, which, according to Josephus, began with the formation of the Zealots and Sicarii during the Census of Quirinius (6 AD), although full-scale open revolt did not occur until the First Jewish–Roman War in 66 AD.

====Resurrection====
According to the New Testament, people reported that they encountered Jesus after his crucifixion. They believed that he had been resurrected (belief in the resurrection of the dead in the Messianic Age was a core Pharisaic doctrine), and his resurrection provided the belief that he would soon return and fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the resurrection of the dead and the Last Judgment.

 gives an early testimony, which was delivered to Paul, of the atonement of Jesus and the appearances of the risen Christ to &quot;Cephas and the twelve&quot;, and to &quot;James [...] and all the apostles&quot;, possibly reflecting a fusion of two early Christian groups:
The later canonical gospels provide more detailed narratives about the resurrection of Jesus. The New Testament accounts do not describe the resurrection itself, but rather accounts of appearances of Jesus. Jesus is described as the &quot;firstborn from the dead&quot;, , the first to be raised from the dead, thereby acquiring the &quot;special status of the firstborn as the preeminent son and heir&quot;. Scholars debate on the historicity of specific details of these narratives such as the empty tomb and burial of Jesus along with the resurrection itself. While Conservative Christian scholars argue in favor of a real, concrete, material resurrection of a transformed body, secular and Liberal Christian scholars typically argue in favor of more naturalistic explanations, such as the vision theory. Other scholars such as Craig L. Blomberg argue that there are sufficient arguments for the historicity of the resurrection. According to Géza Vermes, the concept of resurrection formed &quot;the initial stage of the belief in his exaltation&quot;, which is &quot;the apogee of the triumphant Christ&quot;. The focal concern of the early communities is the expected return of Jesus, and the entry of the believers into the kingdom of God with a transformed body.

Proponents of the vision theory argue that cognitive dissonance influenced the inspiration for resurrection belief. According to Bart Ehrman, the resurrection appearances were a denial response to his disciples&#x27; sudden disillusionment following Jesus&#x27; death. According to Ehrman, some of his followers claimed to have seen him alive again, resulting in a multitude of stories which convinced others that Jesus had risen from death and was exalted to Heaven. According to Paula Fredriksen, Jesus&#x27;s impact on his followers was so great that they could not accept the failure implicit in his death. According to Fredriksen, before his death Jesus created amongst his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and the resurrection of the dead was at hand, that with few exceptions (John 20: 24–29) when they saw him shortly after his execution, they had no doubt that he had been resurrected, and the general resurrection of the dead was at hand. These specific beliefs were compatible with Second Temple Judaism.

According to N.T. Wright, &quot;there is substantial unanimity among the early Christian writers (first and second century) that Jesus had been bodily raised from the dead,&quot; &quot;with (as the early Christians in their different ways affirmed) a &#x27;transphysical&#x27; body, both the same and yet in some mysterious way transformed,&quot; reasoning that as a matter of &quot;inference&quot; both a bodily resurrection and later bodily appearances of Jesus are far better explanations for the empty tomb and the &#x27;meetings&#x27; and the rise of Christianity than are any other theories. Rejecting the visionary theories, Wright notes that visions of the dead were always associated with spirits and ghosts, and never with bodily resurrection. Thus, Wright argues, a mere vision of Jesus would never lead to the unprecedented belief that Jesus was a physically resurrected corpse; at most, he would be perceived as an exalted martyr standing at the right hand of God.

According to Johan Leman, the resurrection must be understood as a sense of presence of Jesus even after his death, especially during the ritual meals which were continued after his death. His early followers regarded him as a righteous man and prophet, who was therefore resurrected and exalted. In time, Messianistic, Isaiahic, apocalyptic and eschatological expectations were blended in the experience and understanding of Jesus, who came to be expected to return to earth.

=====Bodily resurrection=====
A point of debate is how Christians came to believe in a bodily resurrection, which was &quot;a comparatively recent development within Judaism.&quot; According to Dag Øistein Endsjø, &quot;The notion of the resurrection of the flesh was, as we have seen, not unknown to certain parts of Judaism in antiquity&quot;, but Paul rejected the idea of bodily resurrection, and it also can&#x27;t be found within the strands of Jewish thought in which he was formed. According to Porter, Hayes and Tombs, the Jewish tradition emphasizes a continued spiritual existence rather than a bodily resurrection.

Nevertheless, the origin of this idea is commonly traced to Jewish beliefs, a view against which Stanley E. Porter objected. According to Porter, Jewish and subsequent Christian thought were influenced by Greek thoughts, where &quot;assumptions regarding resurrection&quot; can be found, which were probably adopted by Paul. According to Ehrman, most of the alleged parallels between Jesus and the pagan savior-gods only exist in the modern imagination, and there are no &quot;accounts of others who were born to virgin mothers and who died as an atonement for sin and then were raised from the dead.&quot;
====Exaltation and deification====
According to Ehrman, a central question in the research on Jesus and early Christianity is how a human came to be deified in a relatively short time. Jewish Christians like the Ebionites had an Adoptionist Christology and regarded Jesus as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity, while other strands of Christian thought regard Jesus to be a &quot;fully divine figure&quot;, a &quot;high Christology&quot;. How soon the earthly Jesus was regarded to be the incarnation of God is a matter of scholarly debate.

Philippians 2: 5–11 contains the Christ hymn, which portrays Jesus as an incarnated and subsequently exalted heavenly being:
According to Dunn, the background of this hymn has been strongly debated. Some see it as influenced by a Greek worldview while others have argued for Jewish influences. According to Dunn, the hymn contains a contrast with the sins of Adam and his disobedience. Dunn further notes that the hymn may be seen as a three-stage Christology, starting with &quot;an earlier stage of mythic pre-history or pre-existence,&quot; but regards the humility-exaltation contrast to be the main theme.

This belief in the incarnated and exalted Christ was part of Christian tradition a few years after his death and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles.

According to Burton L. Mack the early Christian communities started with &quot;Jesus movements&quot;, new religious movements centering on a human teacher called Jesus. A number of these &quot;Jesus movements&quot; can be discerned in early Christian writings. According to Mack, within these Jesus-movements developed within 25 years the belief that Jesus was the Messiah, and had risen from death.

According to Erhman, the gospels show a development from a &quot;low Christology&quot; towards a &quot;high Christology&quot;. Yet, a &quot;high Christology&quot; seems to have been part of Christian traditions a few years after his death, and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles, which are the oldest Christian writings. According to Martin Hengel, as summarized by Jeremy Bouma, the letters of Paul already contain a fully developed Christology, shortly after the death of Jesus, including references to his pre-existence. According to Hengel, the Gospel of John shows a development which builds on this early high Christology, fusing it with Jewish wisdom traditions, in which Wisdom was personified and descended into the world. While this &quot;Logos Christology&quot; is recognizable for Greek metaphysics, it is nevertheless not derived from pagan sources, and Hengel rejects the idea of influence from &quot;Hellenistic mystery cults or a Gnostic redeemer myth&quot;.

According to Margaret Baker, Christian trinitarian theology derived from pre-Christian Palestinian beliefs about angels. These beliefs revolved around the idea that there was a High God and several Sons of God, one of which was Yahweh. Yahweh was believed to manifest as an angel, human being or a Davidic king, which led some 1st century Palestinians to believe that Jesus was the Son of God, Messiah and Lord. 

===Jewish practices and identity===
The Book of Acts reports that the early followers continued daily Temple attendance and traditional Jewish home prayer. Other passages in the New Testament gospels reflect a similar observance of traditional Jewish piety such as fasting, reverence for the Torah and observance of Jewish holy days.

==Paul and the inclusion of gentiles==

===Saul of Tarsus (Paul the Apostle)===
According to Larry Hurtado, &quot;the christology and devotional stance that Paul affirmed (and shared with others in the early Jesus-movement) was… a distinctive expression within a variegated body of Jewish messianic hopes.&quot; According to Dunn, Paul presents, in his epistles, a Hellenised Christianity. According to Ehrman, &quot;Paul&#x27;s message, in a nutshell, was a Jewish apocalyptic proclamation with a seriously Christian twist.&quot;

Paul was in contact with the early Christian community in Jerusalem, led by James the Just. Fragments of their beliefs in an exalted and deified Jesus, what Mack called the &quot;Christ cult,&quot; can be found in the writings of Paul. According to the New Testament, Saul of Tarsus first persecuted the early Jewish Christians, but then converted. He adopted the name Paul and started proselytizing among the gentiles, adopting the title &quot;Apostle to the Gentiles&quot;. Saint Peter, Paul and other Jewish Christians told the Jerusalem council that Gentiles were receiving the Holy Spirit, and so convinced the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, which opened the way for a much larger Christian Church, extending far beyond the Jewish community.

While Paul was inspired by the early Christian apostles, his writings elaborate on their teachings, and also give interpretations which are different from other teachings as documented in the canonical gospels, early Acts and the rest of the New Testament, such as the Epistle of James.

===Inclusion of gentiles===
Some early Jewish Christians believed that non-Jews must convert to Judaism and adopt Jewish customs in order to be saved. Paul criticized Peter for himself declining to eat with gentiles during a visit by some of these Christians and therefore presenting a poor example to non-Jews joining the Christians. Paul&#x27;s close coworker Barnabas sided with Peter in this dispute. Those that taught that gentile converts to Christianity ought to adopt more Jewish practices to be saved, however, were called &quot;Judaizers&quot;. Though the Apostle Peter was initially sympathetic, the Apostle Paul opposed the teaching at the Incident at Antioch () and at the Council of Jerusalem (). Nevertheless, Judaizing continued to be encouraged for several centuries, particularly by Jewish Christians.

Paul opposed the strict applications of Jewish customs for gentile converts, and argued with the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, where Paul met with the &quot;pillars of Jerusalem Church&quot; (whom Paul identifies as Peter, Jesus&#x27;s brother James, and John) over whether gentile Christians need to keep the Jewish Law and be circumcised. According to Acts, James played a prominent role in the formulation of the council&#x27;s decision ( NRSV) that circumcision was not a requirement. In Galatians, Paul says that James, Peter and John will minister to the &quot;circumcised&quot; (in general Jews and Jewish proselytes) in Jerusalem, while Paul and his fellows will minister to the &quot;uncircumcised&quot; (in general, gentiles) (Galatians 2:9).

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; claims: &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s account of the incident leaves no doubt that St. Peter saw the justice of the rebuke.&quot; However, L. Michael White&#x27;s &quot;From Jesus to Christianity&quot; claims: &quot;The blowup with Peter was a total failure of political bravado, and Paul soon left Antioch as &quot;persona non grata&quot;, never again to return.&quot; Scholar James D. G. Dunn, who coined the phrase &quot;New Perspective on Paul&quot;, has proposed that Peter was the &quot;bridge-man&quot; (i.e., the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;) between the two other &quot;prominent leading figures&quot; of early Christianity: Paul and James, the brother of Jesus.

===Hellenistic influences===
Talmud scholar Daniel Boyarin has argued that Paul&#x27;s theology of the spirit is more deeply rooted in Hellenistic Judaism than generally believed. In &quot;A Radical Jew,&quot; Boyarin argues that the Apostle Paul combined the life of Jesus with Greek philosophy to reinterpret the Hebrew Bible in terms of the Platonic opposition between the ideal (which is real) and the material (which is false). Judaism is a material religion, in which membership is based not on belief but rather descent from Abraham, physically marked by circumcision, and focusing on how to live this life properly. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal Messiah. He used this notion of Messiah to argue for a religion through which all people—not just descendants of Abraham—could worship the God of Abraham. Unlike Judaism, which holds that it is the proper religion only of the Jews, Pauline Christianity claimed to be the proper religion for all people.

By appealing to the Platonic distinction between the material and the ideal, Paul showed how the spirit of Christ could provide &quot;all&quot; people a way to worship the God who had previously been worshipped only by Jews, Jewish proselytes and God-fearers, although Jews claimed that he was the one and only God of all. Boyarin roots Paul&#x27;s work in Hellenistic Judaism and insists that Paul was thoroughly Jewish, but argues that Pauline theology made his version of Christianity appealing to gentiles. Boyarin also sees this Platonic reworking of both Jesus&#x27;s teachings and Pharisaic Judaism as essential to the emergence of Christianity as a distinct religion, because it justified a Judaism without Jewish law.

==Split of early Christianity and Judaism==
===Emergence as separate religious communities===
As Christianity grew throughout the gentile world, the developing Christian tradition diverged from its Jewish and Jerusalem roots. Historians continue to debate the precise moment when early Christianity established itself as a new religion, apart and distinct from Judaism. It is difficult to trace the process by which the two separated or to know exactly when this began. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues together with contemporary Jews for centuries. Some scholars have found evidence of continuous interactions between Jewish-Christian and Rabbinic movements from the mid-to late second century CE to the fourth century CE. Philip S. Alexander characterizes the question of when Christianity and Judaism parted company and went their separate ways as &quot;one of those deceptively simple questions which should be approached with great care&quot;. The first centuries of belief in Jesus were characterized by great uncertainty and religious creativity. &quot;Groups of believers coalesced into proto-factions of like-minded individuals, and then into factions. […] The degree of doctrinal cohesion of these groups is unknown. As attested by the extant texts, confusion and chaos were rampant.&quot; At first, early belief in Jesus was very much a local phenomenon with some degree of coordination among communities on a regional basis.

Both Early Christianity and Early Rabbinic Judaism were far less orthodox and less theologically homogeneous than in modern day. Both religions were significantly influenced by Hellenistic religion and borrowed allegories and concepts from Classical Hellenistic philosophy and the works of the Greek-speaking Jewish authors of the end of the Second Temple period. The two schools of thought eventually firmed up their respective &quot;norms&quot; and doctrines, notably by increasingly diverging on key issues such as the status of &quot;purity laws&quot;, the validity of Judeo-Christian messianic beliefs, and, more importantly, the use of Koine Greek and Latin as sacerdotal languages replacing Biblical Hebrew.

===Trajectory===
Heinrich Graetz postulated a Council of Jamnia in 90 that excluded Christians from the synagogues, but this is disputed. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.

According to historian Shaye J. D. Cohen, &quot;the separation of Christianity from Judaism was a process, not an event&quot;, in which the church became &quot;more and more gentile, and less and less Jewish&quot;. According to Cohen, early Christianity ceased to be a Jewish sect when it ceased to observe Jewish practices, such as circumcision. According to Cohen, this process ended in 70 AD, after the great revolt, when various Jewish sects disappeared and Pharisaic Judaism evolved into Rabbinic Judaism, and Christianity emerged as a distinct religion.

Talmudist and professor of Jewish studies Daniel Boyarin proposes a revised understanding of the interactions between nascent Christianity and Judaism in late antiquity, viewing the two &quot;new&quot; religions as intensely and complexly intertwined throughout this period. According to Boyarin, Judaism and Christianity &quot;were part of one complex religious family, twins in a womb&quot;, for at least three centuries. Alan Segal also states that &quot;one can speak of a &#x27;twin birth&#x27; of two new Judaisms, both markedly different from the religious systems that preceded them&quot;.

According to Robert Goldenberg, it is increasingly accepted among scholars that &quot;at the end of the 1st century AD there were not yet two separate religions called &#x27;Judaism&#x27; and &#x27;Christianity.

Jewish Christianity fell into decline during the Jewish–Roman wars (66–135) and the growing anti-Judaism perhaps best personified by Marcion of Sinope (c. 150). With persecution by the Nicene Christians from the time of the Roman Emperor Constantine in the 4th century, Jewish Christians sought refuge outside the boundaries of the Empire, in Arabia and further afield. Within the Empire and later elsewhere it was dominated by the gentile-based Christianity which became the State church of the Roman Empire and which took control of sites in the Holy Land such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Cenacle and appointed subsequent Bishops of Jerusalem.

===First Jewish–Roman War and the destruction of the Temple===

Full-scale, open revolt against the Romans occurred with the First Jewish–Roman War in 66 AD. In 70 AD, Jerusalem was besieged and the Second Temple was destroyed. This event was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, sectarianism largely came to an end. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the Early Christians and the Pharisees survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as &quot;Judaism&quot;. The term &quot;Pharisee&quot; was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian, and the rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews.

Many historians argue that the gospels took their final form after the Great Revolt and the destruction of the Temple, although some scholars put the authorship of Mark in the 60s. Strack theorizes that the growth of a Christian canon (the New Testament) was a factor that influenced the rabbis to record the oral law in writing.

A significant contributing factor to the split was the two groups&#x27; differing theological interpretations of the Temple&#x27;s destruction. Rabbinic Judaism saw the destruction as a chastisement for neglecting the Torah. The early Christians, however, saw it as God&#x27;s punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus, leading to the claim that the &#x27;true&#x27; Israel was now the Church. Jews believed this claim was scandalous. According to Fredriksen, since early Christians believed that Jesus had already replaced the Temple as the expression of a new covenant, they were relatively unconcerned with the destruction of the Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War.

===Controversies over Passover and the Eucharist===


===Rejection of Jewish Christianity===
In Christian circles, the term &quot;Nazarene&quot; later came to be used as a label for those Christians who were faithful to Jewish law; in particular, it was used as a label for a certain sect of Christians. At first, these Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, were not declared unorthodox but they were later excluded from the Jewish community and denounced. Some Jewish Christian groups, such as the Ebionites, were accused of having unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and gentile converts. The Nazarenes, who held to orthodoxy but adhered to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of orthodoxy in the 4th century. The Ebionites may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, the term &quot;Ebionite&quot; was often used as a general pejorative for all related &quot;heresies&quot;.

Jewish Christians constituted a community which was separate from the Pauline Christians. There was a post-Nicene &quot;double rejection&quot; of the Jewish Christians by adherents of gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. It is believed that no direct confrontation occurred between the adherents of gentile Christianity and the adherents of Judaic Christianity. However, by this time, the practice of Judeo-Christianity was diluted by internal schisms and external pressures. Gentile Christianity remained the sole strand of orthodoxy and it imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.

===Growing anti-Jewish sentiment in Christian writings===
Growing anti-Jewish sentiment among early Christians is evidenced by the Epistle of Barnabas, a late-1st/early-2nd century letter attributed to Barnabas, the companion of Paul mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, although it could be by Barnabas of Alexandria, or an anonymous author using the name Barnabas. In no other writing of that early time is the separation of the gentile Christians from observant Jews so clearly insisted upon. Christians, according to Barnabas, are the only true covenant people, and the Jewish people are no longer in covenant with God. Circumcision and the entire Jewish sacrificial and ceremonial system have been abolished in favor of &quot;the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. Barnabas claims that Jewish scriptures, rightly understood, serve as a foretelling of Christ and its laws often contain allegorical meanings.

While 2nd-century Marcionism rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, Proto-orthodox Christianity instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others. They held the Jewish scriptures to be authoritative and sacred, employing mostly the Septuagint or Targum translations, and adding other texts as the New Testament canon developed. Christian baptism was another continuation of a Judaic practice.

==Later Jewish Christianity==
===Antiquity===
====Ebionites====

The Ebionites were a Jewish Christian movement that existed during the early centuries of the Christian Era. They show strong similarities with the earliest form of Jewish Christianity, and their specific theology may have been a &quot;reaction to the law-free Gentile mission.&quot; They regarded Jesus as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity and his virgin birth, and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites. They used the Gospel of the Ebionites, one of the Jewish–Christian gospels; the Hebrew Book of Matthew starting at chapter 3; revered James the brother of Jesus (James the Just); and rejected Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law. Their name ( &quot;Ebionaioi&quot;, derived from Hebrew &quot;ebyonim&quot;, &quot;ebionim&quot;, meaning &quot;the poor&quot; or &quot;poor ones&quot;) suggests that they placed a special value on voluntary poverty.

Distinctive features of the &quot;Gospel of the Ebionites&quot; include the absence of the virgin birth and of the genealogy of Jesus; an Adoptionist Christology, in which Jesus is chosen to be God&#x27;s Son at the time of his Baptism; the abolition of the Jewish sacrifices by Jesus; and an advocacy of vegetarianism.

====Nazarenes====

The Nazarenes originated as a sect of first-century Judaism. The first use of the term &quot;sect of the Nazarenes&quot; is in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, where Paul is accused of being a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes (&quot;πρωτοστάτην τε τῆς τῶν Ναζωραίων αἱρέσεως&quot;). The term then simply designated followers of &quot;Yeshua Natzri&quot; (Jesus the Nazarene), but in the first to fourth centuries the term was used for a sect of followers of Jesus who were closer to Judaism than most Christians. They are described by Epiphanius of Salamis and are mentioned later by Jerome and Augustine of Hippo, who made a distinction between the Nazarenes of their time and the &quot;Nazarenes&quot; mentioned in Acts 24:5.

The Nazarenes were similar to the Ebionites, in that they considered themselves Jews, maintained an adherence to the Law of Moses, and used only the Aramaic &quot;Gospel of the Hebrews&quot;, rejecting all the Canonical gospels. However, unlike half of the Ebionites, they accepted the Virgin Birth.

The &quot;Gospel of the Hebrews&quot; was a syncretic Jewish–Christian gospel, the text of which is lost; only fragments of it survive as brief quotations by the early Church Fathers and in apocryphal writings. The fragments contain traditions of Jesus&#x27; pre-existence, incarnation, baptism, and probable temptation, along with some of his sayings. Distinctive features include a Christology characterized by the belief that the Holy Spirit is Jesus&#x27; Divine Mother; and a first resurrection appearance to James, the brother of Jesus, showing a high regard for James as the leader of the Jewish Christian church in Jerusalem. It was probably composed in Greek in the first decades of the 2nd century, and is believed to have been used by Greek-speaking Jewish Christians in Egypt during that century.

The Gospel of the Nazarenes is the title given to fragments of one of the lost Jewish-Christian Gospels of Matthew partially reconstructed from the writings of Jerome.

====Knanaya====

The Knanaya of India descend from Syriac Christians of Jewish origin who migrated to India from Mesopotamia between the 4th and 9th century under the leadership of the merchant Knai Thoma. In the modern age, they are a minority community found among the St. Thomas Christians. The culture of the Knanaya has been analyzed by a number of Jewish scholars who have noted that the community maintains striking correlations to Jewish communities, in particular the Cochin Jews of Kerala. The culture of the Knanaya is a blend of Jewish-Christian, Syriac, and Hindu customs reflecting both the foreign origin of the community and the centuries that they have lived as a minority community in India.

===Surviving Byzantine and &#x27;Syriac&#x27; communities in the Middle East===
The unique combination of ethnocultural traits inhered from the fusion of a Greek-Macedonian cultural base, Hellenistic Judaism and Roman civilization gave birth to the distinctly Antiochian &quot;Middle Eastern-Roman&quot; Christian traditions of Cilicia (Southeastern Turkey) and Syria/Lebanon:

Members of these communities still call themselves Rûm which literally means &quot;Eastern Roman&quot;, &quot;Byzantine&quot; or &quot;Asian Greek&quot; in Turkish, Persian and Arabic. The term &quot;Rûm&quot; is used in preference to &quot;Ionani&quot; or &quot;Yāvāni&quot; which means &quot;European Greek&quot; or &quot;&quot; in Classical Arabic and Ancient Hebrew.

Most Middle-Eastern &quot;Melkites&quot; or &quot;Rûms&quot;, can trace their ethnocultural heritage to the Southern Anatolian (&#x27;Cilician&#x27;) and Syrian Hellenized Greek-speaking Jewish communities of the past and Greek and Macedonian settlers (&#x27;Greco-Syrians&#x27;), founders of the original &quot;Antiochian Greek&quot; communities of Cilicia, Northwestern Syria and Lebanon. Counting members of the surviving minorities in the Hatay Province of Turkey, in Syria, Lebanon, Northern Israel and their relatives in the diaspora, there are more than 1.8 million Greco-Melkite Christians residing in the Northern-MENA, the US, Canada and Latin America today, i.e., Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic Christians under the ancient jurisdictional authority of the patriarchates of Antioch and Jerusalem (&quot;Orthodox&quot; in the narrow sense) or their Uniat offshoots (&quot;Catholic&quot; or &quot;united&quot; with Rome).

Today, certain families are associated with descent from the early Jewish Christians of Antioch, Damascus, Judea, and Galilee. Some of those families carry surnames such as Youhanna (John), Hanania (Ananias), Sahyoun (Zion), Eliyya/Elias (Elijah), Chamoun/Shamoun (Simeon/Simon), Semaan/Simaan (Simeon/Simon), Menassa (Manasseh), Salamoun/Suleiman (Solomon), Yowakim (Joachim), Zakariya (Zacharias), Kolath and others.

== In Islamic origins ==
In the field of Quranic studies, it has long been argued that Jewish Christianity played an important role in the formation of Quranic conceptions of Christians in Muhammad&#x27;s Arabia. The first major author to assert that Jewish Christianity played an important role in the formation of Quranic tradition was Aloys Sprenger in his 1861 book &quot;Das Leben und die Lehre des Moḥammad&quot;. Since then, numerous other authors have followed this argument, including Adolf von Harnack, Hans-Joachim Schoeps, M. P. Roncaglia, and others. The most recent notable defenders of this thesis have been Francois de Blois and Holger Zellentin, the latter in the context of his research into the historical context of the legal discourses present in the Quran especially as it resembles the Syriac recension of the Didascalia Apostolorum and the Clementine literature. In turn, several critics of this thesis have appeared, most notably Sidney Griffith. De Blois provides three arguments for the importance of Jewish Christianity: the use of the term &quot;naṣārā&quot; in the Quran (usually taken as a reference to Christians, as in Griffith&#x27;s work) which resembles the Syriac term used for Nazoreans, the resemblance between the description of Mary as part of the Trinity with traditions attributed to the Gospel of the Hebrews, and dietary restrictions associated with the Christian community. In turn, Shaddel argued that &quot;naṣārā&quot; merely may have etymologically originated as such because Nazoreans were the first to interact with the Arabic community in which this term came into use. Alternative sources as well as hyperbole may explain the reference to Mary in the Trinity. However, Shaddel does admit the ritual laws as evidence for the relevance of Jewish Christians. In the last few years, the thesis for the specific role played by Jewish Christians has been resisted by Gabriel Said Reynolds, Stephen Shoemaker, and Guillaume Dye.

==Contemporary movements==
In modern times, the term &quot;Jewish Christian&quot; or &quot;Christian Jew&quot; is generally used in reference to ethnic Jews who have either converted to or been raised in Christianity. They are mostly members of Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Christian congregations, and they are generally assimilated into the Christian mainstream, but they may also retain a strong sense of attachment to their Jewish identity. Some Jewish Christians also refer to themselves as &quot;Hebrew Christians&quot;.

The Hebrew Christian movement of the 19th century was an initiative which was largely led and integrated by Anglicans, and they included figures such as Michael Solomon Alexander, Bishop of Jerusalem 1842–1845; some figures, such as Joseph Frey, the founder of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews, were more assertive of their Jewish identity and independence.

The 19th century saw at least 250,000 Jews convert to Christianity according to existing records of various societies. According to data which was provided by the Pew Research Center, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult American Jews identify themselves as Christians, and most of them identify themselves as Protestants. According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were either raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry. According to a 2012 study, 17% of Jews in Russia identify themselves as Christians.

Messianic Judaism is a religious movement which incorporates elements of Judaism with the tenets of Christianity. Its adherents, many of whom are ethnically Jewish, worship in congregations which recite Hebrew prayers. They also baptize messianic believers who are of the age of accountability (able to accept Jesus as the Messiah), often observe kosher
dietary laws and keep Saturday as the Sabbath. Additionally, they recognize the Christian New Testament as holy scripture, though most of them do not use the label &quot;Christian&quot; to describe themselves.

The two groups are not completely distinct; some adherents, for example, favor Messianic congregations but they freely choose to live in both worlds, such as the theologian Arnold Fruchtenbaum, the founder of Ariel Ministries.

The Hebrew Catholics are a movement of Jews who converted to Catholicism and Catholics of non-Jewish origin who choose to keep Jewish customs and traditions in light of Catholic doctrine.

<text>Joseph Moiseyevich Schillinger (; (other sources: ) – 23 March 1943) was a composer, music theorist, and composition teacher who originated the Schillinger System of Musical Composition. He was born in Kharkov, in the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Kharkiv, Ukraine) and died in New York City. He sometimes used the pseudonym &quot;Frank Lynn&quot;.

==Life and career==
The unprecedented migration of European knowledge and culture that swept from East to West during the first decades of the 20th century included figures such as Sergei Prokofiev and Sergei Rachmaninoff, composers who were the product of the Russian system of music education. Schillinger came from this background, dedicated to creating professional musicians, having been a student at the St Petersburg Imperial Conservatory of Music. He communicated his musical knowledge in the form of a written theory, using mathematical expressions to describe art, architecture, design and music.

In New York, Schillinger flourished, becoming famous as an advisor to many leading American musicians and concert music composers, including George Gershwin, Earle Brown, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Oscar Levant, Tommy Dorsey, Henry Cowell, and Quincy Jones.

Gershwin spent four years (1932–36) studying with Schillinger. During this period, he wrote &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; and consulted Schillinger on it, particularly the orchestration. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger&#x27;s influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing its creation; Ira Gershwin completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for the work. A third account of Gershwin&#x27;s musical relationship with Schillinger was written by Gershwin&#x27;s close friend Vernon Duke, also a Schillinger student, in an article for &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot; in 1947. Some of Gershwin&#x27;s notebooks from his studies with Schillinger are at the Library of Congress.

In the field of electronic music, Schillinger collaborated with Léon Theremin, the inventor of the theremin. Schillinger wrote his &quot;First Airphonic Suite&quot; for Theremin, who played the instrument at the premiere in 1929 with the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Nikolai Sokoloff.
Schillinger applied his mathematical principles to various fields, as he believed that the same underlying mathematics governed all forms of art. His 658-page work &quot;The Mathematical Basis of the Arts&quot; (1943) lays out his ideas in extended detail. Schillinger also collaborated with the filmmaker Mary Ellen Bute, and published a new method of dance notation.

Schillinger taught at a number of institutions, including The New School, but his greatest success was his postal tuition courses, which later became &quot;The Schillinger System of Musical Composition&quot;, published posthumously by Lyle Dowling and Arnold Shaw.

Schillinger accredited a small group of students as qualified teachers of his system, and after his death, one of them, Lawrence Berk, founded a music school in Boston to continue its dissemination. Schillinger House opened in 1945 and later became the Berklee College of Music, where the system survived in the curriculum until the early 1970s.

There has been debate about how many teachers Schillinger certified. The numbers cited range from seven to twelve. To date, only seven certified teachers of the Schillinger System have been substantiated. Three certified teachers were Asher Zlotnik of Baltimore, Maryland (a student and personal friend of Dowling), Edwin Gerschefski, and Roland Wiggins.

<doc id="823767" wikidata="Q3916714" url="?curid=823767" title="Romanian Americans">
<text>Romanian Americans () are Americans who have Romanian ancestry. According to the 2023 American Community Survey, 425,738 Americans indicated Romanian as their first or second ancestry, however other sources provide higher estimates, which are most likely more accurate, for the numbers of Romanian Americans in the contemporary United States; for example, the Romanian-American Network supplies a rough estimate of 1.2 million who are fully or partially of Romanian ethnicity. There is also a significant number of people of Romanian Jewish ancestry, estimated at 225,000.

==History==
The first Romanian known to have been to what is now the United States was Samuel Damian (also spelled Domien), a former priest. Samuel Damian&#x27;s name appears as far back as 1748, when he placed an advertisement in the &quot;South Carolina Gazette&quot; announcing the electrical demonstrations he planned to give and inviting the public to attend. Letters written in 1753 and 1755 by Benjamin Franklin attest to the fact that the two had met and had carried on discussions concerning electricity. Damian remained in the States some years living in South Carolina, then traveled on to Jamaica.

There were several Romanians who became officers in the Union Army during the American Civil War, including Brevet Brigadier General George Pomutz, commander of the 15th Iowa Infantry Regiment, Captain Nicolae Dunca, who fought and died in the Battle of Cross Keys, and Captain Eugen Ghica-Comănești, of the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry. There were also several Romanian soldiers who fought in the Spanish–American War in 1898.

The first major wave of Romanian immigration to the United States took place between 1895 and 1920, in which 145,000 Romanians entered the country. They came from various regions such as Moldavia, Bukovina, and Transylvania, and neighboring countries such as Ukraine and Serbia with significant ethnic Romanian populations. The majority of these immigrants, particularly those from Transylvania and Banat that were under Austro-Hungarian rule, left their native regions because of economic depression and forced assimilation, a policy practiced by Hungarian rulers.

They settled mostly in industrial centers in Pennsylvania and Delaware, as well as in areas around the Great Lakes such as Cleveland, Chicago, and Detroit. The migrants from the Romanian Old Kingdom were mostly Jews, most of whom settled in New York. One of their prominent organizations was the United Rumanian Jews of America. 75,000 Romanian Jews emigrated in the period 1881–1914, mostly to the United States.

During the interwar period, the number of ethnic Romanians who migrated to the U.S. decreased as a consequence of economic development in Romania, but the number of Jews who migrated to the U.S. increased, mostly after the rise of fascism.

After World War II, the number of Romanians who migrated to the United States increased again. This time, they settled mostly in California, Florida and New York, coming from throughout Romania. After the Fall of Communism in 1989, increased numbers of Romanians moved to the United States, taking advantage of the new relaxation of Romania&#x27;s emigration policies. During communist rule, the borders had been officially closed, although some people managed to migrate, including to the United States. In the 1990s, New York and Los Angeles were favorite destinations for Romanian emigrants.

==Distribution==
Romanian Americans are distributed throughout the U.S., with concentrations found in the Midwest, such as in the states of Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois; the Northeast, in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware, as well as California (Los Angeles and Sacramento). In the Southeast, communities are found in Georgia (Metro Atlanta), Florida (South Florida) and Alabama (Montgomery). There are also significant communities in the Southwest U.S., such as in Arizona. The largest Romanian American community is in the state of New York.

The states with the largest estimated Romanian American populations are:

# New York (161,900)
# California (128,133)
# Florida (121,015)
# Michigan (119,624)
# Pennsylvania (114,529)
# Illinois (106,017)
# Ohio (83,228)
# Georgia (47,689)

===Romanian-born population===
According to estimates from the American Community Survey for 2017-2021, there were 166,700 Romanian immigrants nationally, the top counties of which were:

# Cook County, Illinois (11,600)
# Queens Borough, NYC, N.Y. (7,100)
# Los Angeles County, California (6,100)
# Maricopa County, Arizona (5,400)
# Orange County, California (4,400)
# King County, Washington (4,100)
# Manhattan Borough, NYC, N.Y. (3,800)
# Gwinnett County, Georgia (3,700)
# Broward County, Florida (3,600)
# Cuyahoga County, Ohio (3,100)
# Oakland County, Michigan (2,700)
# Brooklyn Borough, NYC, N.Y. (2,600)
# Palm Beach County, Florida (2,400)
# Wayne County, Michigan (2,300)
# Sacramento County, California (2,300)

Romanian-born population in the U.S. since 2010:

== Romania-U.S. relations ==

The United States established diplomatic relations with Romania in 1880, following Romania&#x27;s independence. The two countries severed diplomatic ties after Romania declared war on the United States in 1941; and re-established them in 1947. Relations remained strained during the Cold War era while Romania was under communist leadership. Cold and strained during the early post-war period, U.S. bilateral relations with Romania began to improve in the early 1960s with the signing of an agreement providing for partial settlement of American property claims. Cultural, scientific, and educational exchanges were initiated, and in 1964 the legations of both nations were promoted to full embassies. In March 2005, President Traian Băsescu made his first official visit to Washington to meet with President Bush, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and other senior U.S. officials. In December 2005, Secretary Rice visited Bucharest to meet with President Băsescu and to sign a bilateral defense cooperation agreement that would allow for the joint use of Romanian military facilities by U.S. troops. The first proof of principle exercise took place at Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base from August to October 2007.

==Romanian American culture==
Romanian culture has merged with American culture, characterized by Romanian-born Americans adopting American culture or American-born people having strong Romanian heritage.

The Romanian culture can be seen in many different kinds, like Romanian music, newspapers, churches, cultural organizations and groups, such as the Romanian-American Congress or the Round Table Society NFP. Religion, predominantly within the Romanian Orthodox Church and the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, is an important trace of the Romanian presence in the United States, with churches in almost all bigger cities throughout the country.

In certain areas of the U.S., Romanian communities were first established several generations ago (in the late 19th century and early 20th century) such as in the Great Lakes region; while in others, such as California and Florida, Romanian communities are formed especially by Romanians who emigrated more recently, into the late 20th century and early 21st century. After 1989, large numbers of Romanians emigrated to New York and Los Angeles.

One of the best known foods of Romanian origin is Pastrama.

==Romanian-American Chamber Commerce==
The Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce is a bilateral trade and investment organization that promotes commerce and investment between Romania and United States, and is headquartered in Washington D.C. The Chamber is composed of both Romanian and American businesses and has active chapters in New York, Washington, D.C., Florida, California and the Mid-West. It was founded in February 1990 and is celebrating its 20th year of activity in 2010. The RACC conducts a broad range of events, activities, and services and is a member organization of the Bi-National European Chambers of Commerce of the United States, which includes most of the bilateral chambers of the major EU member states.

<text>Alice Thompson (born in Edinburgh) is a Scottish novelist.

Thompson was educated at St George&#x27;s School, Edinburgh, then read English at Oxford University and wrote her Ph.D. thesis on Henry James. In the 1980s she was the keyboard player with rock band The Woodentops. She has a son, and lives in Edinburgh. Her novel &quot;Justine&quot; was the joint winner of the 1996 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. She also won a Creative Scotland Award in 2000, and was a Writer in Residence in Shetland.

==Novels==
*&quot;Killing Time&quot; (1990) - novella
*&quot;Justine&quot; (1996)
*&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1998)
*&quot;&quot; (2002)
*&quot;The Falconer&quot; (2008)
*&quot;The Existential Detective&quot; (2010)
*&quot;Burnt Island&quot; (2013)
*&quot;The Book Collector&quot; (2015)

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Their romance had been like a fairytale. If only she could work out which fairytale it was, it would somehow help her.&quot; Will it be &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, whose heroine is danced to death, punished by her worldly thoughts, or &quot;Mr Fox&quot;, whose wife is enjoined to &quot;Be bold, be bold, but not too bold&quot;? Or maybe it&#x27;s a modern tale, such as &quot;Rebecca&quot;, with its saturnine hero obsessed with a dead wife and a ghastly secret.&quot;

&quot;THERE is a distinctive ambience to an Alice Thompson novel. From &quot;Justine&quot;, her debut which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, through &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, &quot;Pharos&quot;, &quot;The Falconer&quot;, &quot;The Existential Detective&quot; and &quot;Burnt Island&quot;, there is a kind of gothic postmodernism.&quot;

&quot;A genuinely eerie tale, in a perfect setting and told with just the right amount of ambiguity.&quot;

&quot;Some books evoke a particular piece of music, others, a particular color. The Falconer (2008) by Alice Thompson reminded me of a painting in Glasgow&#x27;s Kelvingrove Art Gallery, which fascinated me as a child. The Fairy Raid (1867) by Scottish pre-Raphaelite Noel Paton depicts a fairy caravan traveling through a grove with a bounty of stolen children, having left changelings in their stead. It&#x27;s an enchanting, overtly romantic work, but death and duplicity hide in the shadows, symbolizing the Victorian fear of high childhood mortality.&quot;

<doc id="823779" wikidata="Q178237" url="?curid=823779" title="Chris de Burgh">
<text>Christopher John Davison (born 15 October 1948), known professionally as Chris de Burgh ( ), is a British-Irish singer-songwriter and musician. He started out as an art rock performer but subsequently started writing more pop-oriented material. He has had several top 40 hit singles in the UK and two in the US, but he is more popular in other countries, particularly Norway and Brazil. His 1986 love song &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; reached number one in several countries. De Burgh has sold over 45 million albums worldwide.

==Early life==
De Burgh was born in Venado Tuerto, Argentina, to Colonel Charles John Davison, a British diplomat, and Maeve Emily (née de Burgh). His maternal grandfather was Sir Eric de Burgh, a British Army officer who had been Chief of the General Staff in India during the Second World War. He took his mother&#x27;s maiden name, &quot;de Burgh&quot;, as a stage name when he began performing, while his legal surname remains &quot;Davison&quot;. His father had substantial farming interests, and Chris spent much of his early years in Malta, Nigeria and the Belgian Congo, as he, his mother and brother accompanied Colonel Davison on his diplomatic and engineering work.

The Davisons finally settled in Bargy Castle, County Wexford, Ireland, which was somewhat dilapidated at the time. It was a twelfth-century castle which Eric de Burgh bought in the 1960s. He converted it into a hotel, and young Chris sang for the guests there.

De Burgh attended Marlborough College in Wiltshire, England, where he was in the year below Nick Drake; de Burgh asked to join a jazz band Drake had formed with four schoolmates, the Perfumed Gardeners, but was rejected as his taste was &quot;too poppy&quot;. De Burgh went on to graduate from Trinity College Dublin, with a Master of Arts degree in French, English and History.

==Musical career==
===Early career===
Chris de Burgh signed his first contract with A&amp;M Records in 1974, and supported Supertramp on their Crime of the Century tour, building himself a small fan base. His début album, &quot;Far Beyond These Castle Walls&quot;, was a folk-tinged stab at fantasy in the tradition of the Moody Blues. It failed to chart upon its release in late 1974. A few months later, he released a single called &quot;Turning Round&quot; from the album, released outside the UK and Ireland as &quot;Flying&quot;. It failed to make an impression in the UK, but it stayed on top of the Brazilian charts for 17 weeks. This became a familiar pattern for the singer/songwriter, as every one of his 1970s albums failed to chart in the UK or US while they racked up big sales in continental European and South American countries.

In 1975 his second album, &quot;Spanish Train and Other Stories&quot;, was released. Whilst (again) not a huge commercial success, the album and tour expanded the fan base, with de Burgh starting to attract a cult following. Along with the epic title track, other fan favourite tracks from the album included &quot;Patricia The Stripper&quot; and &quot;A Spaceman Came Travelling&quot; (the latter released the following year as a single).

1977&#x27;s third album, &quot;At the End of a Perfect Day&quot;, whilst well received and featuring both former Fairport Convention drummer Dave Mattacks and later Fairport drummer Gerry Conway, failed to push de Burgh&#x27;s career significantly, leading to the release of his fourth album &quot;Crusader&quot; in 1979. &quot;Crusader&quot; took a more electric direction, including guitar contributions from Ian Bairnson (formerly of Pilot), bass player David Paton (also of Pilot), and drummer Stuart Elliott (formerly of both Cockney Rebel and of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel), a.k.a. Alan Parsons’ band, all of whom were also working at the time with Kate Bush. The album also featured Sky keyboard player Francis Monkman and Mike Moran. Whilst it attracted a significant number of new fans, &quot;Crusader&quot; still failed to break through in the UK and US. 1980&#x27;s &quot;Eastern Wind&quot; also failed to build further on the (still cult) following in the major territories.

===International success===
In 1981, de Burgh had his first UK chart entry with &quot;Best Moves&quot;, a collection culled from his early albums. It set the stage for 1982&#x27;s Rupert Hine produced &quot;The Getaway&quot;, which reached number 30 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US, thanks to the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Pay the Ferryman&quot;.

In 1984, Chris de Burgh&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Man on the Line&quot;, also performed well, charting at 69 in the US and 11 in the UK (topping the charts in Germany and Switzerland); its first single &quot;High on Emotion&quot; became an international success, reaching the Top 20 in several countries (entering notably the Top 5 in Ireland, France and Switzerland) and the Top 50 in both the UK and US.

Chris de Burgh had an across-the-board hit single with the ballad &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; in late 1986; the song became a number one hit in the UK (number three in America) and a worldwide success, its accompanying album, &quot;Into the Light&quot;, reached number two in the UK (number 25 in the U.S.). That Christmas season, a re-release of de Burgh&#x27;s 1976 Christmas song &quot;A Spaceman Came Travelling&quot; became a Top 40 hit in the UK.

&quot;Flying Colours&quot;, his follow-up to &quot;Into the Light&quot;, entered the British charts at number one upon its 1988 release, yet it failed to make the American charts. De Burgh has not had another hit in the US and his commercial fortunes began to slide in Britain in the early 1990s, yet he retained a following around the world. This is mainly due to inactivity of his previous recording label A&amp;M Records UK division in the U.S.

In 1997 de Burgh composed a song entitled &quot;There&#x27;s a New Star Up in Heaven Tonight&quot;, dedicated to Diana, Princess of Wales. The song was released as a 100-copy limited edition and included on the compilations &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; (2000) and &quot;Now and Then&quot; (2009).

===2007–2021===
In 2007 a concert in Tehran was planned for mid-2008, together with local band Arian, which would have made Chris de Burgh the first western pop singer to perform in Iran since the 1979 revolution. However, the concert never went ahead because he had not been given permission by the Iranian authorities to perform in the country.

In 2008, de Burgh released &quot;Footsteps&quot;, his seventeenth album including cover versions of thirteen songs that inspired him throughout his career, by artists like Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Toto and Pete Seeger; the album reached the Top 5 in UK. In 2011, de Burgh released his follow-up, &quot;Footsteps 2&quot;, which entered the UK Top 40. 

He was the first Western act to play in Lebanon after the Lebanese Civil War.

On his 73rd birthday on 15 October 2021, de Burgh released a music video for his single &quot;Legacy&quot; directed by Iranian filmmaker/animator Sam Chegini, an animated music video for his 27th studio album, &quot;The Legend of Robin Hood&quot;.

===2024–present: &quot;50&quot;===
In October 2024, de Burgh announced and released a new album called &quot;50&quot;, It chronicles his 50 years in the music business.

==Personal life==
Chris de Burgh has been married to his wife Diane since 1977. They lived in Dalkey, Dublin, and in 1997 moved to the Bushey Park Estate in Enniskerry, County Wicklow. They sold Bushey Park in 2023.
They have two sons, Hubie and Michael, and a daughter, Rosanna, best known as the winner of the Miss World competition in 2003 for Ireland. His second cousin, Danny Kinahan of Castle Upton, served as Member of Parliament for South Antrim between 2015 and 2017.

In 1994 he was found to have had an affair with his children&#x27;s 19-year-old Irish nanny, Maresa Morgan, who was assisting the family while de Burgh&#x27;s wife Diane was recuperating in the hospital from a broken neck suffered during a horse-riding accident. De Burgh later said he felt very guilty about the affair and subsequently reconciled with his wife.

In 2011, bottles from de Burgh&#x27;s vintage wine cellar sold for over $500,000, including a world record set for a magnum collection of postwar vintages.

De Burgh has a noted interest in war history, especially that of the First and Second World Wars. His songs contain numerous references to soldiers and battle, and in 2006 he purchased a rare First World War letter written by an unknown soldier.

De Burgh has said that he is &quot;certainly a believer in Christ&quot;, but he has always had a deep distrust of organized religion. De Burgh believes in the power of spiritual healing as an alternative therapy to reduce pain. He claims that he has been able to heal people with his own hands and that he gained an &quot;all-encompassing strength&quot; that was contacted through prayer.

An infamous Pub Quiz Team &quot;Adult Footage of Chris De Burgh&quot;, who compete in the Adelphi Pub Quiz in Preston hosted by Ste-J, have helped both raise and tarnish De Burgh&#x27;s reputation within the University of Central Lancashire student population. They are the joint-most successful quiz team, alongside a quiz team lead by Fingle, Louis and Tom &#x27;The Power&#x27; Foster.

==Media profile==
During the 1970s, de Burgh received mainly positive feedback from the music press, as he attempted to build his career. Since the release of &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; in 1986, both the music and news media have become significantly more negative towards him, both personally and professionally.

De Burgh has pursued and won 16 defamation actions. &quot;The Irish Independent&quot; said he has always been a bit prickly about criticism. Peter Crawley, a theatre reviewer at &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, received a directed response from de Burgh when he wrote a less than sympathetic review of de Burgh&#x27;s show in Dublin&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre in September 2009. Crawley wrote: &quot;He departs the stage for &#x27;Lady in Red&#x27;, invading boxes and draping himself over audience members ... Certain toes will never uncurl after this experience, but it is almost admirable how unaltered de Burgh has remained by the flow of time.&quot; In a lengthy, much-publicised reply to the critic, de Burgh made his feelings known, particularly in the postscript:

AllMusic critic Greg Prato stated, &quot;Depending on who you ask, Chris de Burgh either specializes in pretentious, bombastic art rock disguised as pop or is a master of penning soaring and majestic compositions.&quot; The BBC said of de Burgh, &quot;To his millions of fans, Chris de Burgh is the ultimate romantic singer. But to many others he&#x27;s a figure of fun.&quot; When the staff of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; were putting together a lampoon edition of a new arts and music magazine, they chose de Burgh for the cover. His signature song, &quot;The Lady in Red&quot;, has been repeatedly voted one of the public&#x27;s most disliked songs. In 2006, Neil Norman, writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, described de Burgh as &quot;the world&#x27;s naffest balladeer&quot;. In his favour, Mike DeGagne, writing for AllMusic, acclaimed de Burgh as &quot;a genuine master of the soft ballad&quot; and &quot;one of the finest mood-invoking artists ever&quot;.

<text>Sebastiano Serlio (6 September 1475 – c. 1554) was an Italian Mannerist architect, who was part of the Italian team building the Palace of Fontainebleau. Serlio helped canonize the classical orders of architecture in his influential treatise variously known as &quot;I sette libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (&quot;Seven Books of Architecture&quot;) or &quot;Tutte l&#x27;opere d&#x27;architettura et prospetiva&quot; (&quot;All the works on architecture and perspective&quot;).

==Early life==

Born in Bologna, Serlio went to Rome in 1514, and worked in the atelier of Baldassare Peruzzi, where he stayed until the Sack of Rome in 1527 put all architectural projects on hold for a time. Like Peruzzi, he began as a painter. He lived in Venice from about 1527 to the early 1540s but left little mark on the city.

Serlio&#x27;s model of a church façade was a regularized version, cleaned up and made more classical, of the innovative method of providing a façade to a church with a high vaulted nave flanked by low side aisles, providing a classical face to a Gothic form, that was first seen in Alberti&#x27;s Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1458). The idea was in the air in the 1530s: several contemporary churches compete for primacy, but Serlio&#x27;s woodcut put the concept in every architect&#x27;s hands. As a civil engineer he designed fortifications.

Serlio&#x27;s publications, rather than any spectacular executed work, attracted the attention of François I. Serlio&#x27;s career took off when the king invited him to France, to advise on the construction and decoration of the Château of Fontainebleau, where a team of Italian designers and craftsmen were assembled (including Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola and Benvenuto Cellini). Serlio took several private commissions, but the only one that has survived in any recognizable way is the Chateau of Ancy-le-Franc, built about 1546 near Tonnerre in Burgundy.

Serlio died around 1554 in the Fontainebleau section of Paris, after spending his last years in Lyon.

==Treatise on architecture==
Tutte l&#x27;opere d&#x27;architettura et prospetiva (&quot;All the Works of Architecture and Perspective&quot;) is Serlio&#x27;s practical treatise on architecture. Although Leon Battista Alberti produced the first book-length architectural treatise of the Renaissance (c. 1450, published in 1486), it was unillustrated, written in Latin, and designed to appeal as much to learned humanists and potential patrons as to architects and builders. Serlio pioneered the use of high quality illustrations to supplement the text. He wrote in Italian, some of his books being published with parallel texts in Italian and French. His treatise catered explicitly to the needs of architects, builders, and craftsmen.

The treatise is composed of eight books, the sixth of which was lost for some centuries and the eighth of which was not published until relatively recently. The eighth book is not always considered to be part of the treatise. The first five books cover Serlio&#x27;s works on geometry, perspective, Roman antiquity, the orders and church design. The sixth illustrates domestic designs ranging from peasant huts to royal palaces, providing a unique record of Renaissance house types, including up-to-date fortresses for tyrants and mercenaries as well as Serlio&#x27;s unbuilt design for the Louvre. The seventh book illustrates a range of common design problems ignored by past theorists, including how to remodel, or &#x27;restore&#x27;, Gothic façades following antique principles of symmetry and proportion. The eighth book, called &quot;Castrametation of the Romans&quot;, reconstructs a Roman encampment after the description by Polybius, followed by a military city and monumental bridge supposedly built by the Emperor Trajan. With its forum, consul&#x27;s palace and baths, the book is part-fantasy and part-archaeology, quite unlike Serlio&#x27;s other more practical works.
In the introduction to Book IV, Serlio credits his recently deceased mentor for much of its content: &quot;As for all the pleasant things which you will find in this book, you should give the credit not to me but to my teacher, Baldassare Peruzzi from Siena...&quot; The extent of Peruzzi&#x27;s contribution to the treatise is unknown. &quot;Peruzzi had been the guiding spirit in the detailed study of the remains of antiquity, and he had left his drawings to Serlio. Vasari and Cellini would give most of the credit for the book to Peruzzi, but more recent writers defend Serlio&#x27;s part in the study and his good faith in completing the work of his companion.&quot;

===Plan and publication===

By 1537, when the earliest of his books was published, Serlio had been working on the treatise for at least a decade and had already organized it as a work in seven books. Although Serlio completed all seven projected books, only the first five books were published during his lifetime. The sixth remained in manuscript until the 20th century. He composed two additional books, which can be thought of as appendices: the &quot;Extraordinary Book of Doors&quot;, the last book he saw through the press; and &quot;On Polybius&#x27; Castrametation&quot;, a discussion of ancient Roman military camp design, whose state of completion and intended relation to the other books are both uncertain.

It is not certain what title, if any, Serlio intended for the work as a whole—possibly &quot;General Rules of Architecture&quot;, as is given on the first-published book, but this soon became attached specifically to that book. Various collections were known as the &quot;Five&quot; or &quot;Seven Books on Architecture&quot;, depending on their content. Often it is referred to simply as Serlio&#x27;s &quot;Architettura&quot;, and several significant editions take the title &quot;Tutte l&#x27;opere d&#x27;architettura et prospetiva&quot; (&quot;All the works on architecture and perspective&quot;); though the first time that all nine existing books (or even all seven numbered books) were in fact published in a single edition was in the 2-volume English translation of 1996–2001.

===Content===
Although the books apparently appeared more or less in Serlio&#x27;s desired publication order, his nominal order provides a distinct flow from general to specific:
Serlio&#x27;s reader moves from: first, the Euclidean &#x27;heaven&#x27; composed of the definitions of geometry comprising point, line and perfect (square) planes; second, the underlying, three-dimensional forms of Nature represented through the theory of perspective; third, the architectural embodiment of perfect form reflected in the Pantheon and the &#x27;idealised&#x27; monuments of antiquity; fourth, the rules of the Orders, progressing from Tuscan to Composite, as evidenced in antique ruins and the text of Vitruvius, and the universality of the Orders in composing doors, fireplaces and palace façades; fifth, the use of the Orders in temples of Serlio&#x27;s invention; sixth, the use of the Orders in house designs (again graded, ascending from hut to palace); concluding at the lowest, seventh stage with &#x27;accidents&#x27; or practical problems which the architect might encounter.
Significantly, the last few pages of the second book, &quot;On Perspective&quot;, contain three theatrical scenes (comic, tragic, and satiric) and a stage plan and cross section which were highly influential in Renaissance theater.

In Aesthetics point of view Serlio is one of the first that use the expression fine arts: &quot;and lately Leo X father and patron of all fine arts and all good artists&quot;.

===Influence===
Serlio&#x27;s volumes were highly influential in France, the Netherlands and England as a conveyor of the Italian Renaissance style, and quickly became available in a variety of languages. His plans and elevations of many Roman buildings provided useful repertory of classical images, often reprinted.

Within five years of its original publication, the Flemish scholar Pieter Coecke van Aelst published, in Antwerp, adaptations of Book IV in Flemish, German, and French; Serlio considered these unauthorized versions of his work to be inferior forgeries; nevertheless they served as significant vectors in the spread of his influence. Coecke van Aelst&#x27;s pupil the Dutch architect and engineer Hans Vredeman de Vries propagated Serlio&#x27;s style and ornaments north of the Alps. And a Dutch version of Books I-V -- published in Amsterdam in 1606 and based largely on Coecke van Aelst&#x27;s work in Flemish—served as the basis for the English translation of Books I-V published by Robert Peake in London in 1611. Fourth-hand though it was, it remained the most complete English edition of Serlio for almost four centuries. Its example countered the influence of the engravings of Antwerp Mannerism that were the main inspiration for Jacobean architecture. Later Serlio&#x27;s book was in the libraries of Sir Christopher Wren and John Wood, the Elder the architect and entrepreneur who laid out Bath. Inigo Jones possessed Italian editions, which he annotated.

Books III &amp; IV were published in Spanish in 1552 in Toledo by Juan de Ayala with the same illustrations as the original Italian editions.

<text>Dixon Hall Lewis (August 10, 1802 – October 25, 1848) was an American politician who served as a Representative and a Senator from Alabama.

==Life and career==
Lewis was born on Bothwick plantation, Dinwiddie County, Virginia, and moved to Hancock County, Georgia, with his parents in 1806. He graduated from Mount Zion Academy and from South Carolina College at Columbia in 1820. He moved to Autauga County, Alabama, the same year, where he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1823. That same year he constructed a house (&quot;Old Homestead&quot;) in the town of Lowndesboro, Alabama, twenty miles west of the state capitol in Montgomery. He began to practice law in Montgomery and was elected a member of the Alabama House of Representatives in 1826, serving until 1828. He was elected as a States Rights Democrat to the twenty-first and to the seven succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1829, to April 22, 1844, when he resigned the House to join the Senate. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Indian Affairs from 1831 to 1835. He was nearly elected Speaker of the House in the 26th Congress, receiving 113 votes on the 8th ballot, just four votes short of the necessary 117 needed to be elected. Robert M. T. Hunter was elected on the 11th ballot.

In 1844 Lewis was appointed by his brother-in-law Governor Benjamin Fitzpatrick to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William R. King in 1844. He was reelected as the Democratic candidate in 1847 and served from April 22, 1844, until his death in New York City on October 25, 1848. In the Senate he served as chairman of the Finance Committee from 1845 to 1847. He was appointed to the Board of Visitors of West Point in 1847. Also in 1847 he bought at Baltimore &quot;fifteen or twenty thousand dollars worth of Negroes for use of himself and his son, on their plantations, at home.&quot;

A strikingly obese figure, Lewis was known to weigh as much as 500 pounds (227 kg), making him the heaviest member of Congress ever. A specially-constructed seat was provided in the Senate chambers for him, and his carriage was fitted with unusually heavy suspension springs. According to the WPA Federal Writers&#x27; Project publication &quot;Alabama: A Guide to the Deep South&quot;, a popular witticism among Lewis&#x27;s colleagues was the observation that Alabama had the largest representation of any state.

Lewis is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

<text>DeLisle Stewart (March 16, 1870 – February 2, 1941) was an American astronomer.

In 1896 he became a staff member of Harvard College Observatory, and from 1898 to 1901 he worked at that observatory&#x27;s station at Arequipa, Peru, where he took the photographic plates that William Henry Pickering used to discover Saturn&#x27;s moon Phoebe. He discovered many new nebulas in the sky&#x27;s southern hemisphere.

Later he worked at Cincinnati Observatory until 1910, and later founded the Cincinnati Astronomical Society.

He discovered the asteroid 475 Ocllo.

<text>Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot (1983, Walker &amp; Company) is the first book in the Norby series by American authors Janet Asimov and Isaac Asimov. In it, Jefferson Wells and Norby stop Ing from taking over the Solar System with the help of Jeff&#x27;s brother Fargo Wells, police officer Albany Jones, and Admiral Boris Yobo. According to Isaac Asimov, although Janet Asimov did 90% of the work, his &quot;name was wanted on the book for the betterment of sales [and he] went over the manuscript and polished it a bit.&quot; It, along with its sequel, was illustrated for &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The book starts with Jeff Wells, a cadet at a military academy on Mars in need of a teaching robot, for although he is not flunking, his substandard grades have caused concern for Commander Widlow, who has also pointed out that the Wells family has lost their fortune and his tuition is overdue, ergo termination is recommended. The more sympathetic commandant, Admiral Yobo, permits Jeff to remain in the academy, being well aware of the hardships of the Wellses, and gives Jeff a cashier&#x27;s check to buy a robot. As the academy has ended for summer, Jeff returns to Earth, where he buys a small, fat robot only to discover that it has the only mini-anti-gravity device in existence. The robot reveals he is named Norby, and was owned many years ago by a man named MacGillicuddy who found him in a wrecked spaceship, then used his parts to repair a damaged robot of his own, hence his comical shape.

Norby and Jeff go to the park where the evil villain Ing&#x27;s henchmen are after Fargo Wells, Jeff&#x27;s brother. Norby and Jeff stop the henchmen who are captured by the police. The policewoman in charge of the squad identifies herself as Albany Jones, whom Fargo knew from his days at Neil Armstrong High School. Ing manages to take over Manhattan Island, renaming it the &quot;Kingdom of Ing&quot;, but Norby and Jeff start a revolt against him with the aid of a dowdy woman whom they save from being arrested. However, as Ing&#x27;s soldiers are about to capture Jeff, Norby absconds using a hyperdrive, never before done and creating a subplot for the second book in the series &quot;Norby&#x27;s Other Secret&quot;, as they end up in a jungle planet named Jamya. Norby uses the hyperdrive to return to Earth, where they enlist Admiral Yobo in their quest to stop Ing. The trio takes Admiral Yobo&#x27;s ship, but Norby warns that his hyperspace ability does not guarantee a successful infiltration of the Kingdom of Ing, to which Jeff sternly orders Norby to push forward. The hyperdrive literally causes Yobo&#x27;s ship to hover above Ing&#x27;s head, forcing him to a humiliating surrender. After unmasking Ing, he is revealed to be Commander Widlow, who held a longtime grudge against Jeff and Fargo&#x27;s family. The book ends with Fargo restoring the family fortune, and Albany Jones earning a promotion, as well as starting a relationship with Fargo. Jeff ends the story saying Norby is &quot;his&quot; Mixed-Up Robot.

==Audio version==
A vinyl LP recording of Chapters 1 and 2 of &quot;Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot&quot; was released in 1986 by Caedmon Records. It was recorded by actor Mark Hamill. He has stated that he does not recall recording the tracks.

<doc id="823816" wikidata="Q649122" url="?curid=823816" title="Jugular venous pressure">
<text>The jugular venous pressure (JVP, sometimes referred to as jugular venous pulse) is the indirectly observed pressure over the venous system via visualization of the internal jugular vein. It can be useful in the differentiation of different forms of heart and lung disease.
Classically three upward deflections and two downward deflections have been described.
* The upward deflections are the &quot;a&quot; (atrial contraction), &quot;c&quot; (ventricular contraction and resulting bulging of tricuspid into the right atrium during isovolumetric systole) and &quot;v&quot; (venous filling).
* The downward deflections of the wave are the &quot;x&quot; descent (the atrium relaxes and the tricuspid valve moves downward) and the &quot;y&quot; descent (filling of ventricle after tricuspid opening).

==Method==

===Visualization===

The patient is positioned at a 45° incline, and the filling level of the external jugular vein determined. The internal jugular vein is visualised when looking for the pulsation. In healthy people, the filling level of the jugular vein should be less than 4 centimetres vertical height above the sternal angle. A pen-light can aid in discerning the jugular filling level by providing tangential light.

The JVP is easiest to observe if one looks &quot;along&quot; the surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, as it is easier to appreciate the movement relative to the neck when looking from the side (as opposed to looking at the surface at a 90-degree angle).

Pulses in the JVP are rather hard to observe, but trained cardiologists do try to discern these as signs of the state of the right atrium.

===Differentiation from the carotid pulse===

The JVP and carotid pulse can be differentiated several ways:
* &quot;multiphasic&quot; – the JVP &quot;beats&quot; twice (in quick succession) in the cardiac cycle. In other words, there are two waves in the JVP for each contraction-relaxation cycle by the heart. The first beat represents that atrial contraction (termed &quot;a&quot;) and second beat represents venous filling of the right atrium against a closed tricuspid valve (termed &quot;v&quot;) and not the commonly mistaken &#x27;ventricular contraction&#x27;. These wave forms may be altered by certain medical conditions; therefore, this is not always an accurate way to differentiate the JVP from the carotid pulse. The carotid artery only has one beat in the cardiac cycle.
* &quot;non-palpable&quot; – the JVP cannot be palpated. If one feels a pulse in the neck, it is generally the common carotid artery.
* occludable – the JVP can be stopped by occluding the internal jugular vein by lightly pressing against the neck. It will fill from above.

===JVP waveform===

The jugular venous pulsation has a biphasic waveform.
* The a wave corresponds to right atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid artery pulse. The peak of the &#x27;a&#x27; wave demarcates the end of atrial systole.
* The x descent follows the &#x27;a&#x27; wave and corresponds to atrial relaxation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure.
* The c wave corresponds to right ventricular contraction causing the closed tricuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium during RV isovolumetric contraction.
* The x″ descent follows the &#x27;c&#x27; wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole (ventricular ejection/atrial relaxation). (As stroke volume is ejected, the ventricle takes up less space in the pericardium, allowing relaxed atrium to enlarge). The x&#x27; (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility.
* The v wave corresponds to venous filling when the tricuspid valve is closed and venous pressure increases from venous return – this occurs during and following the carotid pulse.
* The y descent corresponds to the rapid emptying of the atrium into the ventricle following the opening of the tricuspid valve.

===Quantification===
A classical method for quantifying the JVP was described by Borst &amp; Molhuysen in 1952. It has since been modified in various ways. A &quot;venous arch&quot; may be used to measure the JVP more accurately.

===Moodley&#x27;s sign===
This sign is used to determine which waveform you are viewing. Feel the radial pulse while simultaneously watching the JVP. The waveform that is seen immediately after the arterial pulsation is felt is the &#x27;v wave&#x27; of the JVP.

===Abdominojugular test===

The term &quot;hepatojugular reflux&quot; was previously used as it was thought that compression of the liver resulted in &quot;&quot; of blood out of the hepatic sinusoids into the inferior vena cava, thereby elevating right atrial pressure and visualized as jugular venous distention. The exact physiologic mechanism of jugular venous distention with a positive test is much more complex and the commonly accepted term is now &quot;abdominojugular test&quot;.

In a prospective randomized study involving 86 patients who underwent right and left cardiac catheterization, the abdominojugular test was shown to correlate best with the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure. Furthermore, patients with a positive response had lower left ventricular ejection fractions and stroke volumes, higher left ventricular filling pressure, higher mean pulmonary arterial, and higher right atrial pressures.

The abdominojugular test, when done in a standardized fashion, correlates best with the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, and therefore, is probably a reflection of an increased central blood volume. In the absence of isolated right ventricular failure, seen in some patients with right ventricular infarction, a positive abdominojugular test suggests a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or greater.

==Interpretation==
An elevated JVP is the classic sign of venous hypertension (e.g. right-sided heart failure). JVP elevation can be visualized as jugular venous distension, whereby the JVP is visualized at a level of the neck that is higher than normal. The jugular venous pressure is often used to assess the central venous pressure in the absence of invasive measurements (e.g. with a central venous catheter, which is a tube inserted in the neck veins). A 1996 systematic review concluded that a high jugular venous pressure makes a high central venous pressure more likely, but does not significantly help confirm a low central venous pressure. The study also found that agreement between doctors on the jugular venous pressure can be poor, calling into question its reliability as a clinical decision-making tool. Similarly, a 2016 study examined the use of JVP measurements by clinical examination in the evaluation of central venous pressure in patients with heart failure. This study found that JVP examination was not consistent with actual central venous pressures, such that it was unreliable both for ruling in and ruling out heart failure. JVP measurement was especially unreliable in patients with high body fat. Additionally, it was noted that clinicians seemed to &quot;extrapolate&quot; JVP measurements from other, more easily examinable findings (like lung auscultation, body weight, heart rate, brachial blood pressure, and chest radiography findings).

The paradoxical increase of the JVP with inspiration (instead of the expected decrease) is referred to as the Kussmaul sign, and indicates impaired filling of the right ventricle. The differential diagnosis of Kussmaul&#x27;s sign includes constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, and severe right-sided heart failure.

Certain wave form abnormalities, include &quot;cannon a-waves&quot;, or increased amplitude &#x27;a&#x27; waves, are associated with AV dissociation (third degree heart block), when the atrium is contracting against a closed tricuspid valve, or even in ventricular tachycardia. Another abnormality, &quot;c-v waves&quot;, can be a sign of tricuspid regurgitation. The absence of &#x27;a&#x27; waves may be seen in atrial fibrillation.

An exaggerated &quot;y&quot; wave or diastolic collapse of the neck veins from constrictive pericarditis is referred to as Friedreich&#x27;s sign.

<text>&quot;Mein Teil&quot; (German for &quot;My part&quot; or &quot;My share&quot;
) is a song by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was released as the lead single from their fourth studio album, &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; (2004), on 26 July 2004. &quot;Mein Teil&quot; attracted controversy in Germany; the media dubbed it &quot;Das Kannibalenlied&quot; (&quot;The Cannibal-Song&quot;) due to its lyrics referring to the Armin Meiwes cannibalism case, which helped to boost it to second place in the German music charts after its release in early August 2004. It was Rammstein&#x27;s first number-one single, topping the charts in Spain. Remixes of the song were done by Arthur Baker and Pet Shop Boys. &quot;Mein Teil&quot; was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 48th Grammy Awards but lost to Slipknot&#x27;s &quot;Before I Forget&quot;.

==Background and composition==
The song is inspired by the case of Armin Meiwes and Bernd Jürgen Brandes. In March 2001, in Rotenburg an der Fulda, the two men aged in their 40s met each other, cut off and cooked Brandes&#x27; penis and attempted to consume it together. Afterwards, Meiwes killed Brandes, dismembered him and then stored and ate his remains over the next 10 months until he was caught in December 2002. As a result, Meiwes was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in jail for manslaughter, but was later charged with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. According to bassist Oliver &quot;Ollie&quot; Riedel, the song came about after &quot;one of our members brought a newspaper to rehearsal and it had a story about the cannibal guy in it. We were fascinated, shocked and amused at the same time&quot;. Vocalist Till Lindemann stated, &quot;It is so sick that it becomes fascinating and there just has to be a song about it&quot;. A prominent phrase in the song is &quot;... denn du bist, was du isst, und ihr wisst, was es ist&quot; (&quot;Because you are what you eat, and you (pl.) know what it is&quot;).

== Music video ==

The video for &quot;Mein Teil&quot; was directed by Zoran Bihac. It depicts Christoph Schneider cross-dressed as Armin Meiwes&#x27;s mother, Till Lindemann receiving oral sex from an angel (played by Luciana Regina) before he eats her wings and kills her; Christian Lorenz performing ballet in a hallucinatory state; Paul Landers shaking, screaming violently and wandering around in a frantic and crazed state; Richard Kruspe violently fighting with his doppelgänger; Oliver Riedel writhing on the floor in painful spasms with his skin covered in white powder; the band fighting in a mudpit; and Schneider leading the rest of the band on leashes as they crawl out of the Deutsche Oper U-Bahn (subway) station and behave like dogs. At the beginning of the song in the video, the phrase &quot;Suche gut gebauten Achtzehn- bis Dreißigjährigen zum Schlachten – Der Metzgermeister&quot; (&quot;Looking for a well built 18-year-old to 30-year-old to slaughter – The Master Butcher&quot;) is spoken, voiced by Riedel, although the album version of the song does not have this beginning. The quote is taken from an online post by Armin Meiwes. The controversy over &quot;Mein Teil&quot; prompted MTV Germany to restrict the airing of the music video to after 11 PM.

== Live performances ==

It debuted in three consecutive concerts for members of the fan club, in October 2004. This song is one of the most notable live performances of the 2004–2005 &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; tour. From the central backstage access, Till Lindemann appears pulling a giant cooking pot. He is dressed as a blood-stained chef holding a microphone with a large, real cooking knife attached to the end. Keyboardist Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz appears in the pot, with metal cylinders attached to his arms and legs, and plays the keyboard during the song. After the second chorus, Till takes a flamethrower and roasts the bottom of the pot, &quot;cooking&quot; Flake. Flake escapes from the pot and starts running around the stage with flames erupting from his arms and legs, while chased by a knife-wielding Till.

When Flake was asked about what it is like to perform this, he said: &quot;It is fine. It is only pain. Although one can not breathe in, because then one would inhale the flames and die&quot;. Due to all of the theatrical performance, the song usually extended to six or seven minutes when played live. It was played at every concert of the Ahoi Tour, but was dropped on the Liebe ist für alle da Tour, a move which irritated many fans. However, it returned to playlist for the Latin American leg of the tour in 2010, the Auckland and Perth legs of the Big Day Out festival and the South African leg of the tour in 2011, all replacing &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot; except on the Brazilian leg of the South America tour, where both songs were played. The song has since returned to the playlist of the Made in Germany 1995–2011 concert tour. They dropped the live performance again in 2016, until 2019, when it was included in the setlist for their Europe Stadium Tour. It has been included on the setlist for the Europe Stadium Tour and North American Stadium Tour of 2022, and also for the Europe Stadium Tour 2023 and 2024.

<text>Professor Geoffrey Alan Parker FRS (born 24 May 1944) is an emeritus professor of biology at the University of Liverpool and the 2008 recipient of the Darwin Medal. Parker has been called &quot;the professional&#x27;s professional&quot;.

He has a particular interest in behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology, and is most noted for introducing the concept of sperm competition in 1970.
Much of his work from the 1970s onwards has related to the application of game theory (theory of games) to various biological problems, using the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach pioneered by John Maynard Smith and George Price.
With R. R. Baker and V. G. F. Smith in 1972, he proposed a leading theory for the evolution of anisogamy and two sexes, and in 1979 made the first theoretical analysis of sexual conflict in evolution. He has also investigated the evolution of competitive mate searching, animal distributions, animal fighting, coercion, intrafamilial conflict, complex life cycles, and several other topics.

==Life==
Parker was educated at Lymm Grammar School in Lymm, Cheshire, and gained his BSc from University of Bristol in 1965, from where he also gained a doctorate in 1969 under H.E. Hinton, FRS (1912–1977). His Ph.D. was on &quot;The reproductive behaviour and the nature of sexual selection in &quot;Scatophaga stercoraria&quot; L.&quot; (yellow dung fly), and provided a detailed quantitative test of Darwin&#x27;s theory of sexual selection, and an early application of optimality theory in biology.

At this time, most ethologists and ecologists interpreted adaptations in terms of &quot;survival value to the species&quot;&quot;. However, the paradigm shift of the gene-centric view of evolution (popularised by Richard Dawkins in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;) shortly afterwards overturned this idea: mainstream views in behavioural ecology and sociobiology saw natural selection restored to Darwinian principles in terms of survival value to the individual (and its kin). Parker&#x27;s work played a part in this shift and in the early development of behavioural ecology.

He moved to the University of Liverpool in 1968, where he became a lecturer in zoology.

In 1978, he was a senior research fellow in the Research Centre at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge University, returning to Liverpool in 1979. He became a professor in 1989 on election to the Royal Society, 
In 1996, he became the Derby Chair of Zoology, retiring in 2009, but remaining as emeritus professor and continuing scientific research (as of 2014).
In 2005, he won the Frink Medal, of the Zoological Society of London.
In 2008, he won the Darwin Medal: 
He has been awarded the degrees of Doctor of Science, &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University of Bristol. in 2011, and by the Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2018.

<text>Nintendo Power was a video game news and strategy magazine from Nintendo of America, first published in July/August 1988 as Nintendo&#x27;s official print magazine for North America. The magazine&#x27;s publication was initially done monthly by Nintendo of America, then independently, and in December 2007 contracted to Future US, the American subsidiary of British publisher Future plc. Its 24-year production run is one of the longest of all video game magazines in the United States and Canada.

On August 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that it would not be renewing its licensing agreement with Future Publishing, and that &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; would cease publication in December. The final issue, volume 285, was released on December 11, 2012.

On December 20, 2017, a podcast version of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; was launched, which ran until 2023. It was hosted by Chris Slate, the former Editor-in-Chief of the magazine. The podcast is on hiatus as of 2024.

==History==
&quot;Nintendo Fun Club News&quot; preceded &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; as a newsletter sent to club members for free. In mid-1988 it was discontinued after seven issues in favor of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. The new magazine was founded by Nintendo of America marketing manager Gail Tilden in 1988. The first issue, dated July/August 1988, spotlights the NES game &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;. Of this issue, 3.6 million copies were published, with every member of the Nintendo Fun Club receiving a free copy.

From the beginning, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; focuses heavily on providing game strategy, reviews, and previews of upcoming games. In mid-1998, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; first allowed outside advertising in the magazine, formerly reserved for Nintendo-based products only. In its early years, ads only appeared in the first and last few pages of the magazine, leaving no ads to break up the magazine&#x27;s editorial content.

In July 2005, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; introduced a new design to appeal to a limited gaming audience, including a new logo and article format. Along with the cosmetic overhaul came a greater focus on Nintendo fans, staff reviews, rumor-milling, and fan service including an expanded and enhanced reader mail segment (known as &quot;Pulse&quot;) and a revamped &quot;Community&quot; section. Nintendo introduced a new incentive promotional offer that involved the registration of three Nintendo (or Nintendo affiliated) products through Nintendo.com to receive a free three issue trial subscription to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. Later, the magazine changed its focus from game strategies and cheat codes to mainly news, previews, and articles on upcoming games.

On September 19, 2007, Nintendo officially announced that the large magazine publisher Future US would begin publishing &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. The company&#x27;s first official issue was released in October, as issue #222 (December 2007). It was also revealed that circulation would be increased to 13 issues a year, with the extra magazine being a holiday season bonus issue. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; stopped making the Bonus issue in 2011.

On August 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that it had opted not to renew the licensing agreement with Future Publishing and that &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; would cease publication after 24 years. The final issue would be December 2012. Senior Editor Chris Hoffman stated that his staff would &quot;try to make the last issues memorable&quot;. Nintendo reportedly did not actively participate in discussions to continue the magazine online.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; officially returned on December 20, 2017 as a podcast; the podcast uses the original logo design.

==Format==

The magazine was founded by Gail Tilden with support from Nintendo&#x27;s first Fun Club &quot;President&quot; Howard Phillips, himself an avid gamer. While the Fun Club News focused solely on games made in-house by Nintendo, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; was created to allow for reviews of games produced by those licensed by Nintendo, such as Konami, Capcom, and the like. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s mascot in the late 1980s and early 1990s was Nester, character created by the staff at Work House, Japan who first appeared in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Howard and Nester&quot; comic strip. After Phillips left the company, Nester became the magazine&#x27;s sole mascot. Early issues of the magazine featured a two-page &quot;Howard and Nester&quot; comic, which was later replaced with the two-page &quot;Nester&#x27;s Adventures&quot;, later reduced to one page, and eventually dropped altogether. Subsequently, Mario replaced Nester as the mascot of the magazine. Later, during the early 2000s, the magazine made another mascot out of its Senior Writer, Alan Averill. Apparently very camera-shy, Averill himself never appeared in any photos; rather, he was represented by a plush toy of a Blue Slime from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Fans often clamored to see what Averill actually looked like, but the magazine continued to substitute with photos of the toy, and even claimed that Alan was, in fact, a Blue Slime. Eventually, Averill retired from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, joining Nintendo of America&#x27;s localization department. To this day, most fans have never seen a real image of Averill. The inclusion of a photo of Mr. T in the Player&#x27;s Pulse section became a running gag in the early half of 2005. Late in the magazine&#x27;s life, running gags centered on Chuck Norris references and jokes at the expense of writer Chris Shepperd.

During the early 1990s, the magazine undertook a unique and powerful promotion: giving away a free copy of the NES game &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; (&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; in Japan) to every new subscriber. The &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series had been a huge hit in Japan, and Nintendo had hoped the localized North American release would also be a success and promote the RPG genre. However, the game had not sold nearly as well as Nintendo had anticipated, leaving the company with a large number of unsold cartridges. The promotion both helped the company get rid of the unsold merchandise, and won the magazine thousands of new subscribers.

Following the release of the Super NES, the magazine featured lengthy, continuous comic strips based on &quot;Super Mario World&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;. After these stories ended, they were replaced by similar multi-issue stories based on &quot;Star Fox&quot;, &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, and later, Nintendo 64 games such as &quot;Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire&quot; and &quot;Blast Corps&quot;. It had several comics based on the animated series of &quot;Pokémon&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Toward the end, it included short excerpts based on &quot;Custom Robo&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;. It included a very short &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; comic, and another story based on the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; games translated from the original Japanese version.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; produced a series of strategy magazines called &quot;Official Guides from Nintendo Power&quot;, beginning with &quot;The Official Nintendo Player&#x27;s Guide&quot;. After &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; switched from a bi-monthly magazine to a monthly magazine in May 1990, some issues were positioned as strategy guides for single games replacing the guides. However, only four such issues were produced before Nintendo outsourced production of official guides to Prima Games.

== Nintendo Power Line ==
The Nintendo Power Line was a staffed hotline providing gameplay hints about Nintendo consoles, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. It ran from the publishing of the first issue publication of Nintendo Power in 1988 until June 2010, closing in favor of the Internet. The hotline was revived as automated messages, from November 11 to November 13, 2016, in celebration of the release of the NES Classic Edition.

==Spin-off magazines==
During 2001, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; released a spin-off semi-magazine named &quot;Nintendo Power Advance&quot;, featuring the Game Boy Advance and its games. The first issue was complimentary for subscribers, and sold at newsstands. Four issues of &quot;Nintendo Power Advance&quot; were printed, the last of which is a strategy guide for &quot;Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2&quot;.

With the release of &quot;Pokémon&quot; for the Game Boy in 1998, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; includes six mini-issues of &quot;Pokémon Power&quot; mainly featuring tips and strategies for the game.

In 1989, a smaller version of the magazine called &quot;Pocket Power&quot; was distributed at movie theaters showing &quot;The Wizard&quot;.

==Nester==

Nester is the mascot of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. Nester was created by Howard Phillips, &quot;President&quot; of the Nintendo Fun Club and a former editor of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, to be the supporting character in his comic strip, &quot;Howard &amp; Nester&quot;. The comic strips generally advertised new games, often by dream sequences where Nester was actually a given video game character. From 1989 to 1993, The &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Awards featured Nester-shaped trophies and were referred to in the magazine as the &quot;Nesters&quot; in reference to the Oscars.

In the June 1991 issue (Volume 25), Phillips was written out of the strip after his real-life counterpart left Nintendo to work for LucasArts. The strip was retitled &quot;Nester&#x27;s Adventures&quot; the following issue and continued publication until Volume 55 (December 1993). Nester, now as a college student, appeared in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; issue #100. He is seen again in issue #231, the magazine&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, here a grown man with a son new to Nintendo. Nester&#x27;s final appearance in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; is in the final issue, Volume 285, in a comic titled &quot;Nester &amp; Max&quot;, where he is seen reading and lamenting the final issue.

Nester is featured in a few video games that were released while the character was in the magazine. His first appearance was as a commentator in &quot;NES Play Action Football&quot;. Other appearances include the ending of &quot;To the Earth&quot;. Nester is the main character in &quot;Nester&#x27;s Funky Bowling&quot; for the Virtual Boy, which also introduces his sister Hester. The character of Lark in &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; for the Nintendo 64 was based on Nester. Several NES games feature the name &quot;NESTER&quot; as one of the pre-set names on high-score lists, or a default character name such as in &quot;To the Earth&quot;. The original NES release of &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; references both Howard and Nester through character dialog, however this was removed in the later Game Boy Color version. He is mentioned in one line of dialogue in the game &quot;StarTropics&quot;. A DLC microgame in &quot;WarioWare D.I.Y.&quot; created by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; called &quot;Funky Boxing&quot; (a loose reference to &quot;Nester&#x27;s Funky Bowling&quot;) does not have any apparent references to the character, but if the game is opened in the editor, the player&#x27;s boxer is named &quot;NESTER&quot;.

==Podcast==
On December 20, 2017, Nintendo of America announced the official return of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; as a podcast, hosted by former Editor-in-Chief of the original magazine, Chris Slate. In the first episode, Slate states that the podcast was a &quot;passion project&quot; for Nintendo and that he wanted &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; to return. He also acknowledged that the format of that episode was experimental and that the frequency of the series&#x27; episodes hasn&#x27;t been determined. Later in the episode, Slate interviews the developers of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot; and discusses the Nintendo Switch.

On May 12, 2023, an episode based on &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&quot; was released. In it, Chris Slate announced that the episode is the final planned one for the podcast. He followed up by stating that there may still be more special episodes later.

<doc id="823841" wikidata="Q979054" url="?curid=823841" title="Gaetano Filangieri">
<text>Gaetano Filangieri (22 August 1753 – 21 July 1788) was an Italian jurist and philosopher.

Filangieri was born in San Sebastiano al Vesuvio, in the Kingdom of Naples. He was born the third son of a sibship of the noble family of Filangieri, which putatively had arrived in Campania with the Norman conquests. His father Caesar, prince of Arianiello, intended him to pursue a military career, which he commenced at the early age of seven, but soon abandoned for the study of the law. At the bar his knowledge and eloquence secured his success. His defence of a royal decree reforming abuses in the administration of justice gained him the favor of the king, Ferdinand IV of Naples, and his prime minister Bernardo Tanucci, and led in 1777 to an appointments at the court, including as &quot;maggiordomo di settimana&quot; and &quot;gentleman of the chamber&quot; for the monarch, and a post as officer of a Royal Guard. In 1782, the death of his uncle Serafino Filangieri, the archbishop of Naples, gained for Gaetano a sizable inheritance, allowing him more time to study and writing.

The first two volumes of his main work, &quot;La Scienza della Legislazione&quot;, was first published in 1780. The first book contained an exposition of the rules on which legislation in general ought to proceed, while the second was devoted to economic questions. These two books showed him an ardent reformer, and vehement in denouncing the abuses of his time. He insisted on unlimited free trade, and the abolition of the medieval institutions which impeded production and national well-being. Its success was great and immediate not only in Italy, but throughout Europe at large.

In 1783 he married, resigned his appointments at court, and retiring to Cava, devoted himself steadily to the completion of his work. In the same year appeared the third book, relating entirely to the principles of criminal jurisprudence. The suggestion which he made in it as to the need for reform in the Roman Catholic church brought upon him the censure of the ecclesiastical authorities, and it was condemned by the congregation of the Index in 1784. In 1785 he published three additional volumes, making the fourth book of the projected work, and dealing with education and morals.

In 1787 he was appointed a member of the supreme treasury council by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, but his health, impaired by close study and over-work in his new office, compelled his withdrawal to the country at Vico Equense. He died somewhat suddenly of tuberculosis on 21 July 1788, having just completed the first part of the fifth book of his &quot;Scienza&quot;. He left an outline of the remainder of the work, which was to have been completed in six books.

&quot;La Scienza della legislazione&quot; has gone through many editions and translations. The best Italian edition is in 8 vols. 8vo. (1807). The Milan edition (1822) contains the &quot;Opusculi scelti&quot; and a life by Donato Tommasi. A French translation appeared in Paris in 7 vols. 8vo (1786–1798); it was republished in 1822-1824, with the addition of the &quot;Opuscies&quot; and notes by Benjamin Constant.

According to the Gaetano Filangieri Philosophical Society, one of Filangieri&#x27;s ardent admirers was Benjamin Franklin, and the two corresponded from 1780 until Filangieri&#x27;s death in 1788. It consists of (at least) nine letters plus two spurious ones dealing with civil rights and slavery, central to the birth of the United States of America and the future integration of the European Union. The originals are preserved at the American Philosophical Society, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania and the Museo Civico Filangieri in Naples.

Carlo Filangieri, the soldier and statesman, was his son, and Gaetano Filangieri, prince of Satriano was his grandson.

<text>Yaldabaoth, otherwise known as Jaldabaoth or Ialdabaoth (; ; ; &quot;Ialtabaôth&quot;), is a malevolent God and demiurge (creator of the material world) according to various Gnostic sects, represented sometimes as a theriomorphic, lion-headed serpent. He is identified as a false god who keeps souls trapped in physical bodies, imprisoned in the material universe.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name &quot;Yaldabaoth&quot; has been subject to many speculative theories. Until 1974, etymologies deriving from the unattested Aramaic: בהותא, &quot;bāhūṯā&quot;, supposedly meaning &quot;chaos&quot;, represented the majority opinion. After an analysis by the Jewish historian of religion Gershom Scholem published in 1974, this etymology no longer enjoyed any notable endorsement. His analysis showed the unattested Aramaic term to have been fabulated and attested only in a single corrupted text from 1859, with its listed translation having been transposed from the reading of an earlier etymology, whose explanation seemingly equated &quot;darkness&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; when translating an unattested supposed plural form of .

The first etymology was advanced in 1575 by Feuardentius, supposedly translating it from Hebrew to mean . A theory proposed by Matter in 1828 identified the name as descending from and from , a supposed plural form of . Matter however interpreted it to mean &#x27;chaos&#x27;, thus translating &quot;Yaldaboath&quot; as &quot;child of darkness [...] an element of chaos&quot;. 

This etymology was popular due to its perceived literary merits. It inspired Adolf Hilgenfeld to keep Matter&#x27;s proposed &#x27;chaos&#x27; translation, while fabulating a more plausible sounding, but unattested second noun: Aramaic: בהותא, &quot;bāhūthā&quot;, deriving the name from Aramaic: ילדא בהותא, &quot;yaldā bāhūthā&quot; supposedly meaning child of chaos&#x27; in 1884. This became the late 19th, early 20th-century majority opinion, which was endorsed by Schenke, Böhlig, and Labib. The latter two also cited a supposed attestation for Aramaic: בהותא, &quot;bāhūthā&quot;, &#x27;chaos&#x27;. This supposed attestation stemmed from a Targum and was merely a corrupted reading of Aramaic: כהותא, &quot;kāhūthā&quot;, &#x27;strife&#x27; published in a 1859 Bible. This pseudo-variant was translated in Jastrow&#x27;s popular Aramaic dictionary as &#x27;confusion&#x27;.

Helped by these events, Hilgenfeld&#x27;s etymology remained the majority opinion until a 1974 analysis by Scholem explained its origin. Consequently most scholars retracted their endorsement (for example Gilles Quispel did so by lamenting humorously that due its literary merits he believes the originator of the name Yaldabaoth had made the same erroneous association between baoth and tohuwabohu as the former majority opinion). Additionally, Scholem argued that based on the earliest textual data, which termed Yaldabaoth &quot;the King of Chaos&quot;, he was the progenitor of chaos, not its progeny.

Scholem&#x27;s own theory rendered the name as &quot;Yald&#x27; Abaoth.&quot; &quot;Yald&quot;&#x27; being Aramaic: ילדא, : &quot;yaldā&quot; but translated as &#x27;begetter&#x27;, not &#x27;child&#x27; and &quot;Abaoth&quot; being a term attested in magic texts, descending from , one of the names of God in Judaism. Thus he rendered &quot;Yald&#x27; Abaoth&quot; as &#x27;begetter of Sabaoth&#x27;. Black objects to this, because Sabaoth is the name of one of Yaldaboth&#x27;s sons in some Gnostic texts. Instead he suggests the second noun to be Jewish Aramaic: בהתייה, : &quot;behūṯā&quot;, &#x27;shame&#x27;. Which is cognate with , a term used to replace the name Ba&#x27;al in the Hebrew Bible. Thus Blacks&#x27; proposal renders Aramaic: ילדא בהתייה, : &quot;yaldā&quot; &quot;behūṯā&quot;, &#x27;son of shame/Ba&#x27;al&#x27;. 

In his proposed 1967 etymology Alfred Adam already diverged from the then majority opinion and translated Aramaic: ילדא, : &quot;yaldā&quot; similarly to Scholem, as . He believed the name&#x27;s second part to derive from . This he interpreted however to describe more broadly &#x27;the power of generation&#x27;; thus suggesting the name to mean &#x27;the bringing forth of the power of generation&#x27;.

== Historical origins ==

After the Assyrian conquest of Egypt during the 7th century BCE, Seth was considered an evil deity by the Egyptians and not commonly worshipped, in large part due to his role as the god of foreigners. From at least 200 BCE onward, a tradition developed in the Graeco-Egyptian Ptolemaic Kingdom which identified Yahweh, the God of the Jews, with the Egyptian god Seth. Diverging from previous zoologically multiplicitous depictions, Seth&#x27;s appearance during the Hellenistic period onwards was depicted as resembling a man with a donkey&#x27;s head. The Greek practice of interpretatio graeca, ascribing the gods of another people&#x27;s pantheon to corresponding ones in one&#x27;s own, had been adopted by the Egyptians after their Hellenisation; during the process of which they had identified Seth with Typhon, a snake-monster, which roars like a lion. 

The story of the Exodus, featured in the Hebrew Bible, speaks of the Jews as a nation betrayed and subjugated by the Pharaoh, for whom Yahweh subjects Egyptians to ten plagues — destroying their country, defiling the Nile, and killing all their first-born sons. Jewish migration within the Hellenised Ptolemaic Kingdom to Greek-speaking Egyptian cities such as Alexandria led to the creation of the Septuagint, a translation of the Hebrew Bible into Koine Greek. Furthermore, the story of the Exodus was adapted by Ezekiel the Tragedian into the , a Greek play performed in Alexandria and seen by Egyptians and Jews. Egyptian receptions of the Exodus story were widely negative, because it insulted their gods and praised their suffering. Thus it inspired Egyptian works retelling the story, but changing its details to mock the Jews and exalt Egypt and its gods.

In this context some Egyptians discerned similarities between Yahweh&#x27;s in-narrative actions and attributes and those of Seth (such as being associated with foreigners, deserts, and storms), in addition to a phonetic resemblance between , Yahweh&#x27;s name as used by hellenised Jews, and , then considered as the animal of Seth. From this arose a popular response to the Jewish accusation that Egyptians were merely worshipping beasts, namely that, in truth, the Jews themselves worshipped a beast, a donkey or a donkey-headed man, ie Seth.

Accusations of onolatry against the Jews, spread from the Egyptian milieu, with its understanding of the donkey&#x27;s Seth-related importance, to the rest of the Graeco-Roman world, which was largely ignorant of this context. In the most famous variations of narratives alleging Jewish onolatry Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king famous for raiding the Jerusalem Temple, supposedly discovered that its Holiest of Holies was not empty, but instead contained a donkey idol, and Tacitus (early second century CE) claimed that the Jews dedicated in their holiest shrine a statue of a wild ass. After the emergence of Christianity the same charge was also repeated against its devotees. Most famously so in the earliest known depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, the Alexamenos graffito, where a Christian by the name of Alexamenos is shown worshipping a donkey-headed crucified god.

According to Litwa, this tradition forms the basis for the development of Gnostic beliefs about Yaldabaoth.

== Role in Gnosticism ==

Gnosticism originated during the late 1st century CE in non-rabbinical Jewish and early Christian sects. In the formation of Christianity, various sectarian groups, labeled &quot;gnostics&quot; by their opponents, emphasised spiritual knowledge (&quot;gnosis&quot;) of the divine spark within, over faith (&quot;pistis&quot;) in the teachings and traditions of the various communities of Christians. Gnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God, and the Demiurge, &quot;creator&quot; of the material universe. Gnostics considered the most essential part of the process of salvation to be this personal knowledge, in contrast to faith as an outlook in their worldview along with faith in the ecclesiastical authority.

In Gnosticism, the biblical serpent in the Garden of Eden was praised and thanked for bringing knowledge (&quot;gnosis&quot;) to Adam and Eve and thereby freeing them from the malevolent Demiurge&#x27;s control. Gnostic Christian doctrines rely on a dualistic cosmology that implies the eternal conflict between good and evil, and a conception of the serpent as the liberating savior and bestower of knowledge to humankind opposed to the Demiurge or creator god, identified with the Yahweh from the Hebrew Bible. Some Gnostic Christians (such as Marcionites) considered the Hebrew God of the Old Testament as the evil, false god and creator of the material universe, and the Unknown God of the Gospel, the father of Jesus Christ and creator of the spiritual world, as the true, good God. In the Archontic, Sethian, and Ophite systems, Yaldabaoth is regarded as the malevolent Demiurge and false god of the Old Testament who generated the material universe and keeps the souls trapped in physical bodies, imprisoned in the world full of pain and suffering that he created.

However, not all Gnostics regarded the creator of the material universe as inherently evil or malevolent. For instance, Valentinians believed that the Demiurge is merely an ignorant and incompetent creator, trying to fashion the world as well as he can, but lacking the proper power to maintain its goodness. They were regarded as heretics by the proto-orthodox Early Church Fathers.

Yaldabaoth is mentioned mainly in the Archontic, Sethian, and Ophite writings of Gnostic literature, most of which have been discovered in the Nag Hammadi library. In the Apocryphon of John, &quot;Yaldabaoth&quot; is the first of three names of the domineering archon, along with Saklas and Samael. In &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot; he has lost his claim to rulership and, in the depths of Chaos, together with 49 demons, tortures sacrilegious souls in a scorching hot torrent of pitch. Here he is a lion-faced archon, half flame, half darkness. Yaldabaoth appears as a rebellious angel both in the apocryphal Gospel of Judas and the Gnostic work &quot;Hypostasis of the Archons&quot;. In some of these Gnostic texts, Yaldabaoth is further identified with the Ancient Roman god Saturnus.

==Cosmogony and creation myths==
Yaldabaoth is the son of Sophia, the personification of wisdom according to Gnosticism, with whom he contends. By creatively becoming matter in goodness and simplicity, Sophia created the imperfect Yaldabaoth, who has no knowledge of the other aeons. From his mother he received the powers of light, but he used them for evil. Sophia rules the Ogdoas, the Demiurge rules the Hebdomas. Yaldabaoth created six more archons and other fellows. The angels he created rebelled against Yaldabaoth. To keep the angels in subjection, Yaldabaoth generated the material universe.

In the act of creation, however, Yaldabaoth emptied himself of his supreme power. When Yaldabaoth breathed the soul into the first man, Adam, Sophia instilled in him the divine spark of the spirit. After matter, Yaldabaoth produced the serpent spirit (Ophiomorphos), which is the origin of all evil. The light being Sophia caused the fall of man through the serpent. By eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve became wise and rejected Yaldabaoth. Eventually, Yaldabaoth expelled them from the ethereal region, the Paradise, as punishment.

Yaldabaoth continuously attempted to deprive human beings of the gift of the spark of light which he had unwittingly lost to them, or to keep them in bondage. As punishments, he tried to make humanity acknowledge him as God. Because of their lack of worship, he caused the Flood upon the human race, from which a feminine power such as Sophia or Pronoia (Providence) rescued Noah. Yaldabaoth made a covenant with Abraham, in which he was obligated to serve him along with his descendants. The Biblical prophets were to proclaim Yaldabaoth&#x27;s glory, but at the same time, through Sophia&#x27;s influence, they reminded people of their higher origin and prepared for the coming of Christ. At Sophia&#x27;s instigation, Yaldabaoth arranged for the generation of Jesus through the Virgin Mary. For his proclamation, he used John the Baptist. At the moment of the baptism organized by Yaldabaoth, Sophia took on the body of Jesus and through it taught people that their destiny was the Kingdom of Light (the spiritual world), not the Kingdom of Darkness (the material universe). Only after his baptism did Jesus receive divine power and could perform miracles. But since Jesus destroyed his kingdom instead of promoting it, Yaldabaoth had him crucified. Before his martyrdom, Christ escaped from the bodily shell and returned to the spiritual world.

<text>Benjamin Fitzpatrick (June 30, 1802 – November 21, 1869) was an American politician who served as the 11th Governor of Alabama and as a United States Senator from that state. He was a Democrat.

==Early life==
Born in Greene County, Georgia, Fitzpatrick was orphaned at the age of seven and was taken by his sister (Celia Fitzpatrick Baldwin) to Alabama in 1815.

Fitzpatrick helped his brothers manage the land they owned on the Alabama River and served as deputy under the first sheriff of Autauga County. He worked in the law office of Nimrod E. Benson before he was admitted to the bar.

Fitzpatrick studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1821, commencing practice in Montgomery, Alabama. Fitzpatrick served as solicitor of the Montgomery circuit from 1822 to 1823 but moved to his plantation in Autauga County in 1829. He engaged in planting.

==Governor of Alabama and Senator for Alabama==
Fitzpatrick became Governor of Alabama in 1841 and served until 1845. Later, he was appointed as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Dixon H. Lewis and served from November 25, 1848, to November 30, 1849, when a successor was elected.

He was again appointed on January 14, 1853, and elected on December 12, 1853, to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William R. King, who had been elected Vice President of the United States, and served from January 14, 1853, to March 3, 1855. He served in that Congress as Chairman of the Committee on Printing and the Committee on Engrossed Bills. He was elected to the Senate again to fill the vacancy caused by the failure of the legislature to elect his successor on November 26, 1855. In that role, he served several times as President pro tempore of the Senate.

===Failure of state banks===
The country was plagued by economic depression due to the Panic of 1837. Fitzpatrick&#x27;s predecessor as Governor, Arthur P. Bagby, introduced measures to assist the state banks, but the state legislature rejected most of the measures. All of the state banks were closed by Fitzpatrick.

==Vice presidential nomination==
In 1860, Fitzpatrick was nominated for Vice President of the United States by the wing of the Democratic Party that had nominated Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president. However, he refused the nomination, and Herschel V. Johnson of Georgia was ultimately nominated. Fitzpatrick withdrew from the Senate on January 21, 1861, following the secession of his home state.

==Confederacy==
Fitzpatrick did not take a particularly active role in the politics of the Confederacy, although he served as president of the constitutional convention of Alabama in 1865.

==Family==
In 1827, Fitzpatrick married Sarah Terry Elmore, daughter of John Elmore. Their marriage resulted in multiple children, Elmore J., Morris, Phillips, James M., and John A., with Sarah dying in 1839.

Fitzpatrick married his second wife, Aurelia Blassingame, in 1846. Only one child of theirs, Benjamin Jr., survived to adulthood.

==Death==
He died on his plantation near Wetumpka, Alabama, on November 21, 1869, aged 67.

<text>George Robert Carter (December 28, 1866 – February 11, 1933) was the second territorial governor of Hawaii, serving from 1903 to 1907.

==Early life==
Carter was born December 28, 1866, in Honolulu. His mother was Sybil Augusta Judd (1843–1906), daughter of Gerrit P. Judd, and his father was businessman Henry Alpheus Peirce Carter.

Carter was educated at Fort Street School in Honolulu (now McKinley High School) and Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He then attended Yale University, graduating with a Ph.B. While at Yale, he was a member of St. Anthony Hall.

After Yale, Carter spent time serving an apprenticeship with Seattle National Bank.

== Career ==
In 1895 Carter returned to Hawaii to become the cashier of C. Brewer &amp; Co., where his father had been a senior partner from 1862 to 1874. From 1898 to 1902, he helped organize and manage the Hawaiian Trust Company, and was managing director of the Hawaiian Fertilizer Company. In addition, he served as a director for Bank of Hawaii, C. Brewer, and Alexander &amp; Baldwin.

Carter was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Senate from Oahu in 1901. While a territorial senator, he was sent to Washington as an unofficial agent to discuss territorial matters with President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt eventually appointed him Secretary of the Territory in 1902, and then Territorial Governor in 1903, succeeding Sanford B. Dole who resigned to become a federal judge.

In 1905, during Carter&#x27;s administration, the current system of county governments was created; the five county governments (Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Hawaii, and Kalawao) took effect on January 1, 1906. (Oahu County later became the City and County of Honolulu in 1909.)

==Personal life==
He married Helen Strong, daughter of Eastman Kodak president Henry A. Strong April 19, 1892. They had four children: Elizabeth (born August 25, 1895), Phoebe (born September 27, 1897), a daughter who died on June 17, 1903, and George Robert Jr. (born November 10, 1905).

He formed a rowing club with W. B. Goodwin, Hiram Bingham and Marshall Latham Bond, whose members turned their boats over to the University of Washington to begin its rowing program when it broke up.

After his retirement and until his death on February 11, 1933, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Carter remained active in the community. He was a member of the Hawaiian Historical Society and engaged in historical research, collecting valuable books and documents. In 1922, Carter donated his collection to the Hawaiian Mission Children&#x27;s Society, which continues to maintain it as well as the Mission Houses Museum. He was buried in Oahu Cemetery.

Carter&#x27;s estate was appraised at $1,153,902. His will provided for a $25,000 bequest to Kauikeolani Children&#x27;s Hospital. His wife Helen Strong Carter received one-third of his estate, with his two living children receiving the remaining two-thirds.

<text>Walter Francis Frear (October 29, 1863 – January 22, 1948) was a lawyer and judge in the Kingdom of Hawaii and Republic of Hawaii, and the third Territorial Governor of Hawaii from 1907 to 1913.

==Life==
Frear was born October 29, 1863, in Grass Valley, California. His father, Reverend Walter Frear, was born in Poughkeepsie, New York August 16, 1828, graduated from Yale in 1851, came to the Kingdom of Hawaii as a missionary, and then lived in California when he was born. His mother was Frances Elmira Foster. The family returned to Honolulu in 1870, where his father was pastor of the Fort Street Church until 1881.
He graduated from Punahou School in 1881, Yale with a B.A. in 1885, and Yale law school in 1890.
On August 1, 1893, he married Mary Emma Dillingham, the daughter of industrialist Benjamin Dillingham. They had two daughters: Virginia (1900–?) and Margaret (1908–?).

He was appointed as circuit judge on January 1, 1893, by Queen Liliuokalani. On March 7, 1893, he was promoted to serve on the Supreme Court of the Provisional Government. After the death of Albert Francis Judd,
on July 5, 1900, he became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of what was then the Territory of Hawaii.

Frear was appointed governor after George R. Carter by President Theodore Roosevelt on August 15, 1907. Alfred S. Hartwell replaced him as chief justice. He was a member of the Republican Party of Hawaii. After the election of Woodrow Wilson, Frear was replaced by the first governor from the Democratic Party of Hawaii, Lucius Pinkham in November 1913. He died January 22, 1948, in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The Frears founded the Mary D. and Walter F. Frear Eleemosynary Trust to sponsor educational projects.
Frear Hall, a dormitory building built in the 1950s on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus, was named after Governor Frear&#x27;s wife Mary Dillingham Frear, a member of the University&#x27;s Board of Regents from 1920 to 1943. The aging structure was demolished in 2006, to make way for a new dorm facility also called Frear Hall completed in the Summer of 2008.

The Frear home, known as “Arcadia,” was located at 1434 Punahou Street. It was built in 1907. Upon Mary&#x27;s 1951 death it was donated to Punahou School. The property is currently occupied by Arcadia, a retirement residence.

The Frear Center, located at 1132 Bishop Street, was named after Walter and Mary Frear. It is a classroom building of Hawaii Pacific University, and was designed for information systems and computer science courses. The trust also supported Chaminade University of Honolulu.

==Personal life==
Frear&#x27;s father died on May 25, 1922, in Oakland, California. His mother was Frances Elmira Foster (January 29, 1836, in Boston, Massachusetts-February 7, 1924, in Oakland, California), and he had five siblings: Lizzie Lavina Freer, Hugo P. Frear, Henrietta Frear, Philip Foster Frear, Caroline Frear. Lizzie married Edward Frederick Woodward, who served as Mayor of Santa Rosa, California, and as a California state senator from 1903 to 1906. He was also named the surveyor of the Port of San Francisco in 1909.

Frear descends from the initial Freer immigrant to the United States, Huguenot refugee Hugo Freer, who was a patentee, or founder, of New Paltz, New York. He also descends from Louis DuBois (Huguenot), another patentee of New Paltz. His 2nd great-grandfather, Colonel Johannes &quot;John&quot; Freer, commanded his own regiment during the American Revolutionary War (4th Ulster County Regiment).

His 4th cousins, once removed were J. Allen Frear Jr., a United States Senator from Delaware (1949-1961), and Romeo H. Freer, United States Congressman from West Virginia (1899-1901).

<text>Francis William Bourdillon (22 March 1852 at Runcorn, Cheshire, England – 13 January 1921 at Buddington, Midhurst) was a British poet and translator. He is known also as a bibliophile.

==Life==
Born at Trinity Parsonage, Halton Road, Runcorn, Cheshire, Francis William Bourdillon was the eldest son of Rev. Francis Bourdillon, the author, at that time perpetual curate of Runcorn. He was educated at Haileybury College and Worcester College, Oxford, graduating B.A. 1877, M.A. 1882. From 1876 to 1879, he acted as tutor to the sons of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein.

Later Bourdillon lived in Eastbourne, and near Midhurst, Sussex. His friends included Audrey Boyle (1853/4–1916), later as wife of Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson, known as Audrey Lady Tennyson.

==Writer==

Bourdillon is known for his poetry, and in particular, for the single short poem &quot;The Night Has a Thousand Eyes&quot;. He had many collections published, including &quot;Among The Flowers, And Other Poems&quot; (1878), &quot;Minuscula: lyrics of nature, art and love&quot; (1897, siftings of three smaller volumes of verse published anonymously at Oxford in 1891, 1892, and 1894), &quot;Gerard and Isabel: a Romance in Form of Cantefable&quot; (1921), and also &quot;Chryseis&quot;, and &quot;Preludes and Romances&quot; (1908).

In 1896, Bourdillon published &quot;Nephelé&quot;, a romantic novel. He translated &quot;Aucassin et Nicolette&quot; as &quot;Aucassin and Nicolet&quot; (1887), and he wrote the scholarly &quot;The Early Editions of the Roman de la Rose&quot; (1906) as well as &quot;Russia Reborn&quot; (1917) and various essays which the Religious Tract Society published.

==Family==
Bourdillon married Agnes Smyth, and they lived at Buddington, near Midhurst. They had three children, including the World War I pilot and later medical researcher Robert Benedict Bourdillon (1889–1971). The mountaineer Tom Bourdillon (1924–1956) was a grandson.

<text>Lucius Eugene Pinkham (September 19, 1850 – November 2, 1922) was the fourth Territorial Governor of Hawaii, serving from 1913 to 1918. Pinkham was the first member of the Democratic Party of Hawaii to become governor.

==Early life==
Pinkham was born September 19, 1850, in Chicopee, Massachusetts. His parents were Lucius Moulton, a cotton mill proprietor, and Caroline Smith (Fiske) Pinkham. He attended public schools in Boston and Hartford, Connecticut. Although he intended to attend Yale, a horseriding accident prevented him from walking for several years and he never attended college.
Pinkham arrived in Hawaii in 1892 to build a coal handling plant for Oahu Railway and Land Company, and then went to California in 1894. From 1898 to 1903 he was manager of Pacific Hardware, another family business of Benjamin Dillingham. He also oversaw well projects for the sugarcane plantations.

==Hawaii Board of Health==
On April 13, 1904, Pinkham was appointed president of the territorial Board of Health. While president of the Board of Health, he developed the idea of dredging the marshlands of Waikīkī via a two-mile long drainage canal. Although the idea was approved by the Board of Health, no action was taken on the proposal. Over his two terms, Pinkham&#x27;s achievements included improving the conditions of the lepers at the Molokai settlement, economically reducing the occurrence of bubonic plague and cholera in Hawaii. 

In 1907, Pinkham&#x27;s remarks on the Japanese community&#x27;s behavior during a bubonic plague outbreak were found to be offensive, and the Japanese community&#x27;s reaction was a major factor in Governor Frear&#x27;s decision to not reappoint Pinkham for another term. Pinkham was removed from the Board of Health on April 12, 1908.

==Hawaiian Sugar Planter&#x27;s Association==
In April 1909, Pinkham was employed as a labor commissioner by the Hawaiian Sugar Planters&#x27; Association (HSPA) to help transport Filipino labor recruits to Hawaii. After four years, the HSPA ended Pinkham&#x27;s contract &quot;because of differences of opinion about the methods and purposes of recruiting Filipino workers.&quot;

==Territorial Governor of Hawaii==
Despite having no previous political experience, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson appointed Pinkham territorial governor of Hawaii on November 29, 1913, succeeding Governor Walter Frear. His appointment was controversial among Hawaii Democrats. The U.S. Senate confirmed Pinkham&#x27;s appointment by a vote of 46–24, by just one vote more than the two-thirds necessary for confirmation. Pinkham was the state&#x27;s first governor from the Democratic Party, although his affiliations with the Republican Party were often under question.

In 1917, during Pinkham&#x27;s governorship, the deposed former monarch of the Hawaiian Islands, Queen Liliuokalani, died and was buried at the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii. The construction of what would become the Ala Wai Canal and the drainage of the Waikīkī marshlands are credited for enabling the development of Waikīkī as a tourist center, and are considered to be one of the most enduring legacies of Pinkham&#x27;s tenure. Pinkham also worked aggressively to improve the military defense of Hawaii.

He voluntarily resigned from his position and was replaced by Charles J. McCarthy on June 22, 1918.

Pinkham, who never married, died November 2, 1922, in San Francisco, California.

<text>Charles James McCarthy (August 4, 1861 – November 26, 1929) was the fifth Territorial Governor of Hawaii and served from 1918 to 1921.

McCarthy was born August 4, 1861, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Charles McCarthy and Joana (McCarthy) McCarthy. McCarthy moved with his parents to San Francisco, California, in 1866. He was a marginal entrepreneur who came to Hawaii to manage the affairs of a wholesale fruit house. McCarthy owned a saloon and for a time bottled his own alcoholic beverages.

He was a member of the House of Nobles in 1890, supporter of Liliuokalani and ironically a captain in the pro-annexation Honolulu Rifles. He also was a territorial senator 1907-12 and treasurer 1912-14 before becoming chief executive. He was co-founder of the Hawai&#x27;i Democratic Party.

He was appointed by President of the United States Woodrow Wilson to the office after the term of Lucius E. Pinkham. McCarthy believed Republicans were promoting immigration of Oriental laborers to manipulate Hawaii’s demographics to their advantage and served their own business interests, McCarthy was ardently anti-Asian. He appointed Charles Rice and Alfred Castle to lobby in favor of the Hawaiian Rehabilitation Bill which became the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act . The omnibus bill also contained language that made it difficult for “Orientals” from winning homesteads, and barred them from federal jobs in favor of Hawaiians. McCarthy also proposed that the military replace self-government in order to negate possible bloc voting by the large Japanese population in Hawaii. When asked by a congressman if the Japanese would think the action was directed at them, McCarthy said, “Let them think so; what do we care?”

McCarthy also railed against the land policies of the Big Five and was the first governor to advocate statehood for Hawaii. Annoyed by the policies of his Democratic administration, McCarthy was gently nudged out of politics by Republicans. In return, he was given a job as Washington representative of the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce, and later general manager of Hawaiian Dredging Co. during which he worked on the Waikiki Reclamation project which resulted in the construction of the Ala Wai Canal. He died in 1929 in Honolulu, Hawaii.

<text>Lawrence McCully Judd (March 20, 1887 – October 4, 1968) was a politician of the Territory of Hawaii, serving as the seventh territorial governor. Judd is most well-known for his role in the Massie Affair, in which he commuted the sentence of three people convicted of manslaughter in the killing of Josef Kahahawai.

He later served as Governor of American Samoa from March 4 to August 4, 1953. As Governor of Hawai&#x27;i, his notable contributions included the establishment of public parks and numerous playgrounds, as well as reducing state spending. He also raised public awareness about the conditions in the leper colony on Moloka&#x27;i Island.

==Life==
Judd was born March 20, 1887, in Honolulu, Hawaii, the grandson of Gerrit P. Judd, who was an early American Missionary, a cabinet minister to King Kamehameha III, and co-founder of Punahou School.
His father was Judge Albert Francis Judd (1838–1900) and mother was Agnes Hall Boyd (1844–1934). He was the last of nine children. He was married March 6, 1909, at Richmond Hill, New York, to Florence Bell Hackett (1885–1974) and had five children: Helen Florence (1909-?), Agnes Elizabeth (1912-?), Sophie Janet (1913–?), Lawrence McCully Jr. (1917–?) and Emilie Bell (1920–?).
Judd married his second wife, Eva Marie Lillibridge (1913–2002) in 1938.

Judd attended the Punahou School, The Hotchkiss School, and the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of its fraternity chapter of Phi Kappa Psi.

==Career==
Judd made several fact-finding tours during his tenure in the Hawaii Territorial Senate 1920–1927.

===Governor of HawaiI===
Herbert Hoover appointed Judd to succeed Wallace Rider Farrington as the seventh Governor of Hawaii Territory from 1929 to 1934. As territorial governor, he overhauled the system of governance in the colony. A source of controversy during his tenure, Judd commuted the sentence of Grace Hubbard Fortescue, socialite and niece of Alexander Graham Bell, convicted in the territorial courts of manslaughter in the death of a local man, Joseph Kahahawai. Hiring defense lawyer Clarence Darrow, Fortescue&#x27;s case was known as the Massie Affair, a focus of nationwide newspaper coverage. Massie&#x27;s sentence of ten years in prison was whittled down to one hour in the governor&#x27;s chambers at Iolani Palace. The affair was the subject of a 2005 episode of the PBS series &quot;The American Experience&quot;, which included archival footage of Judd.

===Resident superintendent===
Judd became Kalaupapa&#x27;s resident superintendent in 1947.

Judd&#x27;s service running Kalaupapa was a subject in the 2003 historical novel and national bestseller called &quot;Moloka&#x27;i&quot; by Alan Brennert as well as the historical account, &quot;The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai&quot; by John Tayman.

===Samoa and retirement===
On 4 March 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Judd Governor of American Samoa on a temporary basis. He served only five months.

Judd died on October 4, 1968, in Honolulu and was interred in the city&#x27;s Oahu Cemetery in Nuuanu Valley.

<text>An Overseas Service Bar is an insignia worn by United States Army soldiers on the Army Service Uniform, and previously on the Army Green (Class A) and the Army Blue (Dress Blue) uniforms, that indicates the recipient has served six months overseas in a theater of war.

Overseas Service Bars are displayed as an embroidered gold bar worn horizontally on the right sleeve of the Class A uniform and the Army Service Uniform. Overseas Service Bars are cumulative, in that each bar worn indicates another six-month period. Time spent overseas is also cumulative, meaning one bar could be earned for two separate deployments totaling six months.

The Overseas Service Bars shown here as ‘Korea’ were used as Overseas Service Bars in World War II.

==Background==
The original concept of a uniform patch denoting overseas service bar began in the First World War with what was known as an Overseas Chevron. An Overseas Chevron was an inverted chevron patch of golden thread on olive drab backing worn on the lower left sleeve on the standard Army dress uniform, above the service stripes. The chevron was identical to the red Wound Chevron which was worn on the opposite (right) sleeve. Wound Chevrons were replaced by the Purple Heart decoration upon its creation in 1932.

Originally, in 1917, service chevrons came in three colors - 
*Silver Chevron Stateside War Service for 6 months.
*Gold Chevron Overseas War Service for 6 months. 
*Powder Blue Chevron Overseas War Service for less than 6 months.

A soldier&#x27;s overseas service was calculated from the day they disembarked in Britain or France. Sailors and Marines who served in the European war zone aboard a ship for 6 months (i.e., shipboard service) wore their chevron point-upwards. If they served ashore, they qualified for the Overseas War Service chevron. Overseas service chevrons were discontinued by the Navy and Marine Corps after the First World War.

On 30 June 1944, the War Department issued Circular No. 268, authorizing a bar-shaped uniform patch to symbolize overseas service during World War II. During WWII, it was often informally referred to as a &quot;Hershey bar.&quot; The bar was 1/4 inch wide and 1 3/8 inches long, made of golden lace or bullion on an olive drab background, and golden cloth on a khaki background. The background formed a border 1/8 inch wide. The bar of golden lace or bullion was for wear on the service coat or field jacket, and the bar of golden cloth was for wear on the shirt. Time was computed between the dates of departure from the continental United States and the dates of arrival back to the United States, with the date of departure and date of arrival being counted. Time for the purposes of awarding a bar was calculated either continuously, or at intervals, from 7 December 1941 until &quot;a date 6 months subsequent to the termination of the present war.&quot; The Territory of Alaska was considered outside the continental United States for calculating time, but service &quot;on the Great Lakes and in any harbor, bay, or other enclosed arm of the sea along the coast, and that part of the sea which is within 3 miles of the coastline of the United States will not be included in computing length of service required.&quot; Time where personnel were deemed absent without leave or in a status amounting to desertion was subtracted from total time earned.

The bar or bars were to be worn centered on the outside of the left sleeve of the service coat, field jacket, or shirt, 4 inches from the sleeve opening. If service stripes (each signifying three years of honorable service for enlisted men) were worn on the service coat, the overseas service bars were to be worn immediately above them. For those who had also performed overseas service in the First World War, the overseas service bar and chevron were worn together.

On 2 February 1945, the War Department issued Circular No. 41, which rescinded paragraph 4b of Circular No. 268, 1944, and substituted for paragraph 2 that the background would be made of olive drab felt or &quot;of the same material and color as the garment on which worn&quot; and authorized overseas service bars for wear on the &quot;service coat, winter and summer shirt, field jacket, work clothing, and special suits or jackets.&quot; The production of bars made of golden rayon was authorized.

In 1953, the Overseas Service Bar adopted its current name, and the patch was moved to be worn on the lower right sleeve, instead of the left.

Prior to the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was rare for an individual to have more than four Overseas Service Bars. Due to the protracted nature of the recent conflicts with resulting multiple deployments, it is not unusual for senior officers and NCOs to have eight or more Overseas Service Bars.

The Overseas Service Bar is a separate award from the Overseas Service Ribbon, established in 1981, which recognizes overseas service in any location outside of the continental United States (CONUS), without regard as to whether or not the area has been designated a combat zone. Regulations permit receiving both awards for the same qualifying period of service.

<text>Guglielmo Pepe (13 February 1783 – 8 August 1855) was an Italian general and patriot. He was brother to Florestano Pepe and cousin to Gabriele Pepe. He was married to Mary Ann Coventry, a Scottish woman who was the widow of John Borthwick Gilchrist, linguist and surgeon to the East India Company.
==Biography==
Pepe was born at Squillace in Calabria.

He entered the army at an early age, but in 1799 he took part in the Neapolitan Republic, inspired by the French Revolution. While fighting against the Bourbon troops, which were led by Cardinal Ruffo, he was captured and exiled to France. He entered Napoleon&#x27;s army and served with distinction in several campaigns, including those in the Neapolitan kingdom: first under Joseph Bonaparte, and later under Joachim Murat.

After commanding a Neapolitan brigade in the Peninsular campaign, Pepe returned to Italy in 1813, with the rank of general, to help reorganize the Neapolitan army. When news of the fall of Napoleon (1814) reached Italy, Pepe and several other generals tried, without success, to force Murat to grant a constitution as the only means of saving the kingdom from foreign invasion and the return of the Bourbons.

On Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba (1815) Murat, after some hesitation, placed himself on the emperor&#x27;s side and waged war against the Austrians, with Pepe on his staff. After several engagements the Neapolitans were forced to retire after the Battle of Tolentino (in which Pepe participated), and eventually agreed to the Treaty of Casalanza, according to which Murat was to abandon the kingdom; but the Neapolitan officers retained their rank under Ferdinand IV, who now regained the throne of Naples.

While engaged in suppressing brigandage in the Capitanata, Pepe organized the carbonari into a national militia, intending to use them for political purposes. He had hoped that the king would grant a constitution; but when that hope failed he contemplated seizing Ferdinand, the emperor of Austria, and Metternich, who were expected at Avellino, in order to compel them to install a liberal constitution in Italy (1819). The scheme broke down through an accident, but in the following year a military rising broke out, the mutineers cheering for the king and the constitution. Pepe himself was sent against them; but while he was deciding on which course to follow, Ferdinand promised a constitution (July 1820). A revolt in Sicily having been repressed, Pepe was appointed inspector-general of the army.

Meanwhile, the king, who had no intention of respecting the constitution, went to the Congress of Laibach to confer with the sovereigns of the holy alliance assembled there, leaving his son as regent. The king obtained the loan of an Austrian army with which to restore absolute power, while the regent dallied with the Liberals. Pepe, who in parliament had spoken in favour of deposing the king, now took command of the army and marched against the Austrians. He attacked them at Rieti (March 1821), but his raw levies were repulsed.

The army was gradually disbanded. Pepe then spent several years in England, France and other countries, publishing a number of books and pamphlets of a political character and keeping up his connection with the Carbonari. When the 1848 revolution and war broke out all over Italy, Pepe returned to Naples, where a constitution had again been proclaimed. He was given command of the Neapolitan army, which was to cooperate with Piedmont against the Austrians. However, when he reached Bologna, the king, who had already changed his mind, recalled him and his troops. Pepe, after hesitating between his desire to fight for Italy and his oath to the king, resigned his commission in the Neapolitan service and crossed the Po with 2,000 volunteers to take part in the campaign. After a good deal of fighting in Venetia, he joined Manin in the siege of Venice and took command of the defending army. When the city was forced by hunger to surrender to the Austrians, Pepe and Manin were among those excluded from the amnesty.

He again went into exile and died in Turin in 1855.

<text>Joseph Boyd Poindexter (April 14, 1869 – December 3, 1951) was the eighth Territorial Governor of Hawaii and served from 1934 to 1942.

==Early life==
Joseph Boyd Poindexter was born in Canyon City, Oregon to Thomas W. and Margaret (Pipkin) Poindexter. He attended Wesleyan University and earned his LL.B. degree from Washington University in St. Louis. He was admitted to the Montana Bar in 1892, and served as County Attorney of Beaverhead County, Montana from 1897 to 1903. He was appointed judge of the Fifth Judicial District in Beaverhead, Madison, and Jefferson counties, Montana in 1909. He later served as a district judge in Montana from 1909 to 1915, and he later served as Attorney General of Montana from 1915 to 1917.

==Career==
In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Poindexter as Judge on the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. Poindexter served in that capacity from May 14, 1917, to February 16, 1924. He then practiced law in Hawaii until 1934. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Poindexter the eighth governor of Hawaii on January 30, 1934.

A joint Congressional Committee visited Hawaii in 1937 and submitted a report in February 1938 recommending a plebiscite for Hawaii statehood. The plebiscite, held on November 5, 1940, resulted in the voters recommending statehood for Hawaii.

Poindexter was appointed to the governorship of Hawaii by Roosevelt in 1934; he was reappointed to the governorship in 1938. Poindexter was the only second territorial governor to that point to serve more than one term of office.

In the immediate aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Poindexter placed the territory under martial law and allowed the U.S. military to form a military government. He mobilized the Hawaii Territorial Guard while the attack was still ongoing and appointed himself its captain general. The military government would continue until 1943. After his term expired, Poindexter remained in office until August 24, 1942, when his successor, Ingram Stainback, was confirmed. He remained in Hawaii and practiced law and in July 1943, the Hawaii supreme Court appointed him as one of the trustees of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate.

===Gubernatorial accomplishments===
An editorial at his death credited Poindexter with a balanced budget, improved civil service and wage laws that regulated child labor and improved public health and welfare. During his administration the Hawaii Housing Authority was established, and projects such as the &quot;Mayor Wright homes&quot; (named for George F. Wright) were begun.
He advocated for larger airports and other major public works projects, including roads, parks, schools and the Ala Wai Golf Course.

==Later life==
Poindexter resumed his law practice after leaving the governorship. In July 1943, the Hawaii Supreme Court appointed him a trustee of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate (now Kamehameha Schools), in which capacity he served until his death in Honolulu, Hawaii on December 3, 1951. His picture appeared on the cover of the July 23, 1934 Times Magazine. He is buried next to his wife Margaret in Mountain View cemetery in Dillion Montana.

==Personal life==

Poindexter married Margaret Conger in Dillon, Montana on April 22, 1897. The couple had two children, Everton and Helen.

The tombstone of Charles A. Stainback (1878-1961), is located in Somerville Cemetery, Somerville, Tennessee.

Stainback received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University and his Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago.

==Career==
Stainback, a well-connected Democrat, came to Hawaii shortly after graduation and was appointed by Democratic Governor Lucius E. Pinkham in 1914 to the post of Territorial Attorney General. He resigned in 1917 to join the Army and rose to the rank of major. When the war ended he returned to private practice in Hawaii.

Previous to his administration, Stainback was a United States District Attorney and then a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Territory of Hawaii. He was appointed to the office by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is likely that his friendships with then-Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Senator Kenneth McKellar, both Tennesseans, played a role in his appointment. However, Stainback was essentially powerless for the first two years of his term since Gov. Joseph B. Poindexter had allowed the military to take over the government on December 7, 1941. During that time, Hawaii was governed by Army generals Walter Short, Delos Emmons, and Robert C. Richardson, Jr.

A conservative Democrat, Stainback, whose full powers were restored on April 13, 1944, played a significant role in the lifting of martial law in wartime Hawaii. Stainback believed Communists were plotting to take over the Hawaiian Islands. He also provided a genesis for Hawaii&#x27;s Democratic Revolution of 1954 by decrying the land monopolies in Hawaii and calling for land reform. Upon resigning his post on May 8, 1951, Stainback had served eight years, eight months and six days, the longest of any appointed governor up to that point.

On September 26, 1951, he was appointed by President Harry S. Truman as an associate judge to the Hawaii Supreme Court.

===Views on statehood===
Stainback had supported statehood until as late as 1946 but vocally opposed it from 1947. In testimony to the House Committee on Territories hearings on statehood for Hawaii in January 1946, Stainback was pro-statehood, saying &quot;I think it is a fundamental principle that no people can govern another people better than they can govern themselves. In other words, we are governed from Washington in a great many things relating to our national affairs&quot;. He supported Hawaii&#x27;s admission based on the fact that, as Hawaii took on &quot;all the burdens of a State&quot;, it should also be afforded the privileges of statehood such as voting members of Congress. In March 1946, Stainback still seemed supportive of statehood at further congressional hearings in Washington, but Roger Bell suggests that this was in order to not seem out of step with Hawaiians at a time when his reappointment as governor was pending.

By the middle of the year, statehood campaigners had become openly critical of Stainback because of his seemingly ambivalent attitude to pursuing the issue. By 1947, it was clear that Stainback was reluctant to support immediate statehood or further fund the Statehood Committee. Instead, the Territorial Legislature became the major proponent of statehood, establishing and funding its own Statehood Commission.

Stainback claimed he changed his mind on statehood upon being briefed by the US Army about Communist activity on the islands. Stainback argued for Commonwealth status similar to Puerto Rico instead of statehood, suggesting that Hawaii would benefit from the federal tax exemption which would stimulate economic growth.

==Death and legacy==
Stainback died in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii and is buried at Oahu Cemetery.

Stainback is memorialized on the island of Hawaii by the Stainback Highway, a little-used 18-mile road that leads from the Hawaii Belt Road near Hilo at to Kulani Correctional Facility, a minimum security state prison at . His son, Macklin Fleming, was an associate justice of the California Court of Appeal and an early opponent of affirmative action.

<doc id="823939" wikidata="Q748194" url="?curid=823939" title="Twilight (1998 film)">
<text>Twilight is a 1998 American neo-noir thriller film directed by Robert Benton, written by Benton and Richard Russo, and starring Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, Reese Witherspoon, Stockard Channing and James Garner. The film&#x27;s original score was composed by Elmer Bernstein.

It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing $15.1 million against its $20 million budget.

== Plot ==
Aging private detective Harry Ross, an ex-cop, is working on a case to return 17-year-old runaway Mel Ames to her parents&#x27; home. He tracks down Mel and her sleazy boyfriend, Jeff Willis, at a Mexican resort. During a struggle, Mel accidentally shoots Harry with his pistol, striking him in the upper thigh.

The plot picks up two years later when Ross lives in Southern California in the guest quarters of Mel&#x27;s wealthy parents, Jack and Catherine Ames. They are former movie stars, now in the twilight of their careers. Jack is dying of cancer, which is out of remission, and he and Ross pass the time playing cards.

One day, Jack asks a favor of Harry: to deliver a package to an address in Los Angeles. It turns out to be the first development in a series of twists and turns in a 20-year-old case involving the disappearance of Catherine&#x27;s ex-husband.

When Harry arrives at the address, he encounters a man named Ivar, who has just been fatally shot and shoots at Harry. Harry is detained by police, including former colleague Lt. Verna Hollander. At the police station, he runs into another (now retired) old pal and colleague, Raymond Hope.

Verna and Raymond are both sympathetic, as they had heard rumors that Harry suffered damage to his genitals when shot in Mexico. Harry explains that he was only shot in the thigh.

Harry likes Catherine, who flirts with him from time to time. He acts as an agent for Jack and Catherine, who are being blackmailed by Jeff, now out of prison, and his parole officer, Gloria Lamar.

Harry and Catherine have sex for the first (and only) time. Jack angrily realizes this when he has a heart attack that same night, and Catherine responds to his call for help wearing Harry&#x27;s shirt.

Harry, meanwhile, is forced to acknowledge that his friends have deceived and manipulated him.

Raymond tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but Harry has figured out that Raymond was a conspirator in the murder of Catherine&#x27;s first husband 20 years before. Raymond shoots at Harry, but Harry kills him first. Following this shooting, Harry reconciles with Catherine and Jack. He leaves town with Verna.

== Production ==
The working title for &quot;Twilight&quot; was &quot;The Magic Hour.&quot; Principal photography began on November 11, 1996. Parts of the movie were filmed at the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Hollywood Division Station house in Hollywood, California. Many of the police officers seen in the background are actual police officers. The beach sequences was filmed at Mandalay Beach in Oxnard, California. For Raymond Hope&#x27;s house, they chose the George Jacobsen House, designed by John Lautner, in the Hollywood Hills. The Ames&#x27; house was shot at the Dolores del Río House in Santa Monica, California. The Ames&#x27; old family cabin was filmed at the Arch Oboler House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, in Malibu, California. The production wrapped in March 1997. Paul Newman gave Susan Sarandon part of his salary after discovering she was being paid less than he and Gene Hackman were making.

== Release ==
&quot;Twilight&quot; was released in theatres on March 6, 1998, in 1,351 theatres in the U.S., and made $5,866,411 in its opening weekend. While the film featured many notable A-list actors, &quot;Twilight&quot;&#x27;s budget of $20 million and gross revenue of $15,055,091 indicates that it was a box office bomb after being in theatres for eight weeks.

== Reception ==
The film holds a 61% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 62 reviews with an average rating of 6.1/10. The consensus states: &quot;It suffers from a frustratingly deliberate pace, but with nuanced performances from Paul Newman, Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, and Reese Witherspoon to fall back on, &quot;Twilight&quot; can&#x27;t help but be compelling.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert wrote,
&quot;The reason to see the film is to observe how relaxed and serene Paul Newman is before the camera. How, at 73, he has absorbed everything he needs to know about how to be a movie actor so that at every moment he is at home in his skin and the skin of his character. It&#x27;s sad to see all that assurance used in the service of a plot so worn and mechanical.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Owen Gleiberman gave the film a C+ grade. He wrote it was meant to be &quot;...about the relationship between a semiretired gumshoe (Paul Newman) and two veteran movie stars (Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon)...&quot; but was more &quot;...about the trio of aging stars who play them.&quot;

Barbara Shulgasser of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; said that it had a &quot;dazzlingly smart script by Benton and co-writer Richard Russo.&quot; She wrote further: &quot;&quot;Twilight&quot; is as close to a perfect film as I&#x27;ve seen in a long while.&quot;

Heather Clisby of &quot;Movie Magazine International&quot; described it as &quot;one of those films where everybody involved seems to have actually cared, thus we have a superb product with memorable characters brought to life by some of the finest actors of our time.&quot;

== Home media ==
The DVD was released on October 7, 1998, in Widescreen. Features included English closed-captioning, Spanish subtitles, and the theatrical trailer, which included scenes not in the final edit of the film.

<doc id="823954" wikidata="Q2218966" url="?curid=823954" title="Samuel Wilder King">
<text>Samuel Wilder King (December 17, 1886March 24, 1959) was the eleventh Territorial Governor of Hawaii and served from 1953 to 1957. He was appointed to the office after the term of Oren E. Long. Previously, King served in the United States House of Representatives as a delegate from the Territory of Hawaii. He was a member of the Republican Party of Hawaii and was the first of native Hawaiian descent to rise to the highest office in the territory.

==Education==
His father James A. King (1832–1899) was a ship&#x27;s master for Samuel Gardner Wilder, and later politician in the Republic of Hawaii. His mother was Charlotte Holmes Davis, daughter of part-Hawaiian Robert Grimes Davis, who descended from Oliver Holmes, Governor of Oʻahu under Kamehameha I.
King was born December 17, 1886, in Honolulu and was a subject of the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i. 
A devout Roman Catholic, King attended Saint Louis School, but graduated from McKinley High School. Upon graduating, King went on to study at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He entered the United States Navy as a commissioned officer where he served from 1910 to 1924. At the time of his discharge, he had attained the rank of lieutenant commander.
On March 18, 1912, he married Pauline Nawahineokalai Evans, another part-Hawaiian.

==Early career==
King returned to his hometown in 1925 where he entered the real estate profession. In 1932, he ran for his first public office and served for two years on the Board of Supervisors of Honolulu. In 1934, King was elected to the United States Congress as a delegate. He served in Washington, D.C., from January 1935 to January 1943.
With the outbreak of World War II, King resigned from Congress to accept a naval commission to become a commander, then captain. He retired from military service in 1946.

==Later career==
Once again, King returned to his hometown and was appointed to a sub-cabinet office of the governor&#x27;s administration. King served in the Emergency Housing Committee for a year. He was then appointed to the Hawaii Statehood Commission in 1947 where he stayed until 1953. President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed King to the governorship that year. He was the first governor of Hawaiian ancestry. He served in ʻIolani Palace until his resignation on July 31, 1957. During his term in office he signed HB 706 on June 5, 1957, which outlawed the death penalty in Hawaii. It became Act 282. He died in Honolulu March 24, 1959, just before Hawaii achieved statehood. He was buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.

==Descendants==
His son Samuel Pailthorpe King (1916–2010) became a lawyer and Federal Judge. His grandson, Samuel Pailthorpe King, Jr. also became a lawyer and in 1985 established his own law practice with his wife, Adrienne King, also a lawyer, as King and King, Attorneys-At-Law. King&#x27;s great-grandson, Samuel Wilder King II, is also a lawyer now practicing in Honolulu; his own son was named Samuel Wilder King III. King&#x27;s great-granddaughter, violist and composer Leilehua Lanzilotti, was a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in Music.

==Legacy==
In 2018, King was the subject of the short documentary &quot;Samuel Wilder King: Hawaii Statehood&quot; directed by Carolina Gratianne and produced by Daniel Bernardi with the collaboration of El Dorado Films, the Veteran Documentary Corps, and the King family.

<text>Glen Walter Edwards (March 5, 1916–June 5, 1948) was a test pilot for the United States Air Force. He is the namesake of Edwards Air Force Base.

==Early life==
Edwards was born March 5, 1916, in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada, where he lived until 1931. When he was aged 13, his parents Claude Gustin Edwards, a real estate salesman, and Mary Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Briggeman) Edwards moved the family to California, settling in Lincoln, northeast of Sacramento. He attended Lincoln High School, where he was a member of the Spanish Club and worked on the school newspaper, &quot;El Eco&quot;. After graduating from high school in 1936, he attended Placer Junior College in Auburn, California, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.S. degree and from Princeton University with a M.S. degree.

==World War II==
===North Africa and southern Italy===
After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from Berkeley, Edwards enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces on July 15, 1941, five months before Pearl Harbor, as an aviation cadet. Upon completion of flight training, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant at Luke Field, Arizona, in February 1942. Assigned to the 86th Light Bombardment Squadron of the 47th Bombardment Group, he departed for the North African Theater of Operations (Tunisia) as a flight commander in October 1942. There he led his flight of A-20s on extremely hazardous, low-level missions against German tanks, convoys, troop concentrations, bridges, airfields, and a variety of other tactical targets.

When the Germans broke through the Kasserine Pass in February 1943, his undermanned and undersupplied squadron flew 11 missions in a single day, repeatedly attacking advancing armored columns and blunting their thrust. On one of these missions, Edwards and his crew set a record by completing a combat mission—from takeoff to landing—in just 19 minutes. His squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for this action.

During his tours in the North African campaign and the invasion of Sicily, Edwards completed 50 combat missions and was awarded four Distinguished Flying Crosses and six Air Medals.

Returning to the United States in December 1943, he was assigned to the Pilot Standardization Board at Florence Army Air Field, South Carolina, and then, in late 1944, to the Flight Test Division at Wright Field, Ohio. He graduated from the Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School (initial designation of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School) (Class 45) there in May 1945 and was assigned to the Bomber Test Operations Section.

==Post war==
===The first test flights===
Although assigned to Wright Field, he spent much of his time at Muroc Army Air Field, in California&#x27;s high desert, testing a wide variety of experimental prototypes such as Douglas&#x27; highly unconventional pusher-prop light bomber, the XB-42 Mixmaster. In December 1945, he and Lieutenant Colonel Henry E. Warden set a new transcontinental speed record when they flew this airplane from Long Beach, California, to Bolling Air Force Base, in Washington, D.C., in five hours and 17 minutes.

In 1946, he was the principal project pilot for the jet-powered Convair XB-46 prototype bomber. It was also during this period that he acquired his first experience with a flying wing, as he familiarized himself with the flying qualities of the Northrop N-9M, a single-seat, one-third scale mock-up of the giant XB-35 prototype bomber.

His superb skills as a pilot, engineer and officer were held in such high esteem that his immediate superior, Major Robert Cardenas, recommended him as project pilot for an unprecedented program—the first attempt to exceed the speed of sound in the Bell X-1. That assignment, however, went to Capt. Chuck Yeager.

===University===
Edwards was, instead, selected to be among the first to be sent to Princeton University for graduate study in the aeronautical sciences. The recent war had spawned truly revolutionary advances in aviation technology and it had become apparent to men such as Col. Albert Boyd, the chief of the Flight Test Division, that a new breed of military test pilot—one who combined the talents of a highly skilled pilot with the technical expertise of an engineer—would be required to effectively evaluate increasingly complex aircraft and onboard systems. Thus, when Glen Edwards graduated from Princeton with a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1947, he represented one of the first of this new breed.

==Death==
In May 1948, Edwards was selected to join the team of test pilots and engineers at Muroc who were then evaluating the Northrop YB-49, the all-jet version of the exotic flying wing bomber. After his first few flights, he was not favorably impressed, confiding to his diary that it was &quot;the darndest airplane I&#x27;ve ever tried to do anything with. Quite uncontrollable at times.&quot; Then, on June 5, 1948, he was flying as co-pilot with Maj. Daniel Forbes when the airplane departed from controlled flight and broke apart in the sky northwest of the base. All five crew members were killed.

==Tributes==
One of Col. Boyd&#x27;s first orders of business, when he assumed command of Muroc in late 1949, was to rename the base in honor of someone who had given his life to the cause of experimental flight research. By tradition, Air Force bases were named after distinguished individuals who were native sons of the state in which a base was located. Boyd could think of no one more deserving than the bright, young, Canadian-born Californian whose promising career had ended in the skies over the western Mojave.

On December 8, 1949, Muroc Air Force Base was redesignated Edwards Air Force Base. During ceremonies on January 27, 1950, a plaque was unveiled, reading: &quot;A pioneer of the Flying Wing in the western skies, with courage and daring unrecognized by himself.&quot; It now sits in front of the headquarters of the Air Force Flight Test Center. In 1995, Edwards was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor.

In 2008, the family of Captain Edwards donated his diaries to the Air Force Flight Test Center museum. The diaries describe Edwards&#x27; experiences during World War II, from when he joined the Army Air Corps, up to a few days before he died.

There is a middle school in Lincoln, California, named after Edwards.

<text>Daniele Manin (13 May 180422 September 1857) was an Italian patriot, statesman and leader of the Risorgimento in Venice.

==Early and family life==

Daniele Manin was born Daniele Fonseca in Ramo Astori, Venice, where his birthplace is commemorated by a plaque.

His mother, Anna Maria Bellotto, came from Padua, while his father, Pietro Antonio Fonseca (1762–1829), came from a family that was originally from Verona. Daniele&#x27;s Veronese grandfather, Samuele Medina, was Jewish, but he converted to Christianity in 1759 and took the name Manin because Ludovico Manin, the last Doge of Venice, sponsored his conversion. Daniele Manin&#x27;s niece was the painter and printmaker Leopoldina Zanetti Borzino.

Manin studied law in the University of Padua.

From an early age, he hated Austria, which at the time ruled Venice.

==Revolutionary leader==
The failed attempt of the Bandiera Brothers, Venetians who had served in the Austrian navy, against the Neapolitan Bourbons in 1844, ignited the Venetian patriotism. In 1847, Manin presented a petition to the Venetian congregation, a consultative assembly tolerated by Austria, informing the emperor of the wants of the nation. He was arrested on a charge of high treason on 18 January 1848, although his arrest only served to agitate of the Venetians.

Two months later, the people of Venice forced Count Pallfy, the Austrian governor, to release Manin (17 March). The Austrians soon lost control of the city: the Venetian Arsenal was seized by revolutionaries, and, under the direction of Manin, a civic guard and a provisional government were instituted. The Austrians withdrew from Venice on 26 March, and Manin became president of the Republic of San Marco. He was in favour of Italian unity and was not anxious about annexation to Piedmont because he would have liked to enlist French aid. He then resigned his powers to the Piedmontese commissioners on 7 August. But after the Piedmontese defeat at Custoza, and the armistice in which King Charles Albert abandoned Lombardy and Venetia to Austria, the Venetians attempted to lynch the royal commissioners, whose lives Manin saved. An assembly was summoned, and a triumvirate formed with Manin at its head.

Towards the end of 1848, the Austrians reoccupied all of the Venetian mainland. Early in 1849, Manin was again chosen president of the Republic, and conducted the defence of the city, with the citizens fighting back the reoccupation.

After the defeat of Charles Albert&#x27;s troops at Novara in March, the Venetian assembly voted to grant Manin powers.

Meanwhile, the Austrian forces closed around the city. Manin was seconded by the Neapolitan general, Guglielmo Pepe, who led the Neapolitan army to defend Venice against his king&#x27;s order. On 26 May, the Venetians were forced to abandon Fort Marghera; food was becoming scarce; on 19 June, the powder magazine blew up; and in July, cholera broke out. The Austrian batteries, subsequently, began to bombard Venice, and when the Sardinian fleet withdrew from the Adriatic, the city was also attacked by sea in demagogues.

On 24 August 1849, Manin succeeded in negotiating amnesty to save Manin himself, Pepe and some others who were to go into exile. On 27 August, Manin left Venice on board a French ship.

==Exile and last years==
His wife died in Marseille, and he himself reached Paris. In Paris, he became a leader among the Italian exiles. There, he became a convert from republicanism to monarchism, being convinced that only under the auspices of King Victor Emmanuel could Italy be freed, and together with Giorgio Pallavicini and Giuseppe La Farina, he founded the Società Nazionale Italiana, with the object of propagating the idea of unity under the Piedmontese monarchy.

His daughter died in 1854 from her illness. Manin died on 22 September 1857 and was buried in Ary Scheffer&#x27;s family tomb.

In 1868, two years after the Austrians finally departed from Venice, his remains were brought to his native city and honoured with a public funeral. The gondola carrying his coffin was decorated with a bow &quot;surmounted by the lion of Saint Mark, resplendent with gold&quot;, bore &quot;the Venetian standard veiled with black crape&quot;, and had &quot;two silver colossal statues waving the national colours of Italy&quot;. The statues represented the unification of Italy and Venice. His remains are interred in a sarcophagus, which is located in the Piazzetta dei Leoncini, on the north side of the Basilica San Marco.

<text>Merrimack College is a private Augustinian university in North Andover, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1947 by the Order of St. Augustine with an initial goal to educate World War II veterans. It enrolls approximately 5,700 undergraduate and graduate students from 34 states and 36 countries. The school has an acceptance rate of 75%.

== History ==
Merrimack College was established in 1947 by the Order of Saint Augustine following an invitation by the Archbishop of Boston, Richard Cushing. It is the second Augustinian affiliated college in the United States after Villanova University. Church leaders saw a need to create a liberal arts college largely in a commuter school format for veterans returning from World War II. Archbishop Cushing tabbed the Rev. Vincent McQuade, O.S.A, to lead the college. McQuade was a native of Lawrence, Massachusetts and longtime friend of Cushing. McQuade joined the effort after working on the faculty at Villanova working with veterans transitioning home from the war. McQuade organized the creation process, including land purchases and zoning, securing a charter from the state, establishing curriculum, and managing the college&#x27;s campus construction. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to The Augustinian College of the Merrimack Valley in March 1947 and the college officially opened in September of the same year.

=== Presidents ===
Merrimack College has had 8 presidents since it was founded in 1947:

# Vincent A. McQuade, 1947-1968 (founder)

<doc id="824008" wikidata="Q1265882" url="?curid=824008" title="Dunkel">
<text>Dunkel (), or Dunkles (), is a word used for several types of dark German lager. &quot;Dunkel&quot; is the German word meaning &quot;dark&quot;, and dunkel beers typically range in color from amber to dark reddish brown. They are characterized by their smooth, malty flavor. In informal terms, such as when ordering at a bar, &quot;dunkel&quot; is likely to mean whatever dark beer the bar has on tap, or sells most of; in much of north and western Germany, especially near Düsseldorf, this may be Altbier.

In Bavaria, dunkel, along with helles, is a traditional style brewed in Munich and popular throughout Bavaria. With alcohol concentrations of 4.5% to 6.0% by volume, dunkels are weaker than doppelbocks, another traditional dark Bavarian beer. Dunkels are produced using Munich malts, which give the dunkel its color. Other malts or flavors may also be added.

Many dunkels have a distinctive malty flavor that comes from a special brewing technique called decoction mashing. Most commonly, dunkel beers are dark lagers, but the term is also used to refer to dark wheat beers such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel. Dunkel weizen is another term used to refer to dark wheat beers, which are fruity and sweet with more dark, roasted malts than their lighter counterpart, the hefeweizen.

==Munich dunkel==
Dunkels were the original style of the Bavarian villages and countryside, and it was the most common style at the time of the introduction of the Reinheitsgebot (1516). As such, it is the first &quot;fully codified and regulated&quot; beer. Its ABV is rarely higher than 5.5%, and it has low bitterness, a distinctive dark color, and a malty flavor. Dunkel is brewed using lager yeasts.

Lighter-colored lagers were not common until the later part of the 19th century when technological advances made them easier to produce.

==Franconian dunkel==
Dunkel is also widespread in parts of Franconia, for example the Franconian Switzerland, where it has been originally the most common beer type. The region has a lot of microbreweries, of which many still produce Dunkel. One Example is Weissenohe Abbey Brewery (&quot;Weissenoher Klosterbrauerei&quot;).

==Examples==
* Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren Dunkel
* Andechser Dunkel
* Augustiner Dunkel
* Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel
* Dunkel Fester A dunkel-style beer brewed in the UK by the Wychwood Brewery
* Erdinger Dunkel

<doc id="824063" wikidata="Q1973852" url="?curid=824063" title="Law of India">
<text>The legal system of India consists of civil law, common law, customary law, religious law and corporate law within the legal framework inherited from the colonial era and various legislation first introduced by the British are still in effect in modified forms today. Since the drafting of the Indian Constitution, Indian laws also adhere to the United Nations guidelines on human rights law and the environmental law.
Personal law is fairly complex, with each religion adhering to its own specific laws. In most states, registering of marriages and divorces is not compulsory. Separate laws govern Hindus including Sikhs, Jains and Buddhist, Muslims, Christians, and followers of other religions. The exception to this rule is in the state of Goa, where a uniform civil code is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces, and adoption. On February 7, 2024, the Indian state of Uttarakhand also incorporated a uniform civil code. In the first major reformist judgment for the 2010s, the Supreme Court of India banned the Islamic practice of &quot;Triple Talaq&quot; (a husband divorcing his wife by pronouncing the word &quot;Talaq&quot; thrice). The landmark Supreme Court of India judgment was welcomed by women&#x27;s rights activists across India.

, there are about 891 Central laws as per the online repository hosted by the Legislative Department, Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India. Further, there are many State laws for each state, which can also be accessed from the same repository.

== History ==
Ancient India represented a distinct tradition of law, and had a historically independent thought of legal theory and practice. The Dharmaśāstras played an important role. The Arthashastra, dating from 400 BC and the Manusmriti, from 100 AD, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance. Manu&#x27;s central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism, and was cited across Southeast Asia.

Early in this period, which culminated in the creation of the Gupta Empire, relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition. Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.

After the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent, Islamic Sharia law spread with the establishment of Delhi Sultanate, Bengal Sultanate and Gujarat Sultanate.
The Corps of Forty also played a major role by establishing some Turkish law in India.

In the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire became the world&#x27;s largest economy, its sixth ruler, Aurangzeb, compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri with several Arab and Iraqi Islamic scholars, which served as the main governing body in most parts of South Asia.

With the advent of the British Raj, there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were abolished in favour of British common law. The first royal charter for the East India Company in the 1600s granted them the ability to make laws in order to better govern its “official representatives” in India. This was a power that grew rapidly with the increase in the East India Company&#x27;s influence and power over India, giving the East India Company a wider and more powerful judicial authority and jurisdiction. During the eighteenth century, the East India Company wanted a more amicable ruling system where they would not have only English Common Law dictating the laws of a state that was not English yet. They opted to have a set of laws and courts in both the interior and exterior governments where the exterior, also known as the Presidencies, was ruled by English Law, staffed by English judges and lawyers, and dealt with Englishmen. The interior, the Mofussil, dealt with native law such as Hindu and Muslim personal law, Company Regulations, and Islamic criminal law. This caused issues later in history when people who were not with the East India Company and were not native to India committed crimes in India. It was not easy to find out which law systems they should be subject to. In terms of Mofussil courts, Europeans still had an advantage over Indians since they could bring suit against Indians in any mofussil court but Indians would have to go to the Supreme Court to bring suit to Europeans. This was financially and logistically very hard, causing a lot of dismay in Indians. Europeans often used this system to abuse and exploit Indians in criminal and civil litigation. This system was ended in 1793 by the Bengal Government, which prohibited all Europeans from living more than ten miles from Calcutta unless they agreed to be subject to Mofussil courts.

In the early 1830s, there were motions within the House of Commons, during the debates for the renewal of the East India Company&#x27;s royal charter, for a special “Select Committee” to be made to look into the East India Company&#x27;s objectives and operations in India. The motions were brought to the attention of the House of Commons because there were concerns about the East India Company&#x27;s effectiveness in the administration of justice and law-making. The general consensus coming out of the Select Committee was that the law in India required reform since the East India Company&#x27;s current system had conflicting laws and had religious laws that did not bode well with unity. The East India Company&#x27;s charter of 1833 radically changed the structure of law-making in India with regard to the legislatures, it replaced the legislatures of each region with an all-India Legislative Council that had wide jurisdiction and general legislative power. This stripped the law-making authority of the Presidencies which had conflicting laws and made the law more unitary in nature. The council passed all-India laws as well as an Indian Law Commission. The progenitor of this codification was a British lawyer by the name of Thomas Macaulay who became the first Law Member, the head of the All-India Legislative Council, and the first head of the Law Commission. He had gone before parliament in July 1883 to make his case as to why India&#x27;s government needed reformation and, according to the minutes from the meeting, he believed that Europeans provided the grounds for representative institutions but said that “in India, you cannot have representative institutions” since they do not know “what good governance is” and the “British must be the ones to show them”. Macaulay then set his sights on being the one to codify Indian law and set sail to India by the end of 1883. By the end of 1884, Macaulay and the All-India Legislative Council had officially begun the process of the codification of Indian Law. This is when India&#x27;s laws became more attuned with British Common Law, which came from rulings in British legal cases, and is what Judges used to decide cases. This meant that India had limited, on the way to becoming zero, usage of Hindu or Islamic Laws while the law of the colonizers became the predominant form of litigation. This was seemingly problematic as it did not take into concern the pre-existing Islamic and Hindu Laws that governed their societies for a long time. However, acceptance of this new code of laws was wide in India.

As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has few, if any, connections to Indian legal institutions of the pre-British era.

== Constitutional and administrative law ==
The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950 is the lengthiest written constitution in the world. Although its administrative provisions are to a large extent based on the Government of India Act 1935, it also contains various other provisions that were drawn from other constitutions in the world at the time of its creation. It provides details of the administration of both the Union and the States, and codifies the relations between the Federal Government and the State Governments. Also incorporated into the text are a chapter on the fundamental rights of citizens, as well as a chapter on directive principles of state policy.

The constitution prescribes a federal structure of government, with a clearly defined separation of legislative and executive powers between the Federation and the States. Each State Government has the freedom to draft its own laws on subjects classified as state subjects. Laws passed by the Parliament of India and other pre-existing central laws on subjects classified as central subjects are binding on all citizens. However, the Constitution also has certain unitary features, such as vesting power of amendment solely in the Federal Government, the absence of dual citizenship, and the overriding authority assumed by the Federal Government in times of emergency.

== Criminal law ==

The Indian Penal Code formulated by the British during the British Raj in 1860, forms the backbone of criminal law in India. This law was later repealed and replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 governs the procedural aspects of the criminal law.

Jury trials were abolished by the government in 1960 on the grounds they would be susceptible to media and public influence. This decision was based on an 8-1 acquittal of Kawas Nanavati in &quot;K. M. Nanavati vs. State of Maharashtra&quot;, which was overturned by higher courts.

In February 2011, the Supreme Court of India ruled that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to counsel.

Capital punishment in India is legal. Renuka Shinde and Seema Mohan Gavit, who were guilty of kidnapping and killing at least 13 children under 6 years, are currently lodged in Yerwada Central Jail. They were also the first women in India to be given capital punishment. The last execution was conducted on 20 March 2020, where the death sentence was awarded to the convicts—Pawan Gupta, Akshay Singh Thakur, Vinay Sharma, and Mukesh Singh—by a trial court, a decision which was upheld by Delhi High Court and Supreme Court as well.

== Contract law ==

The main contract law in India is codified in the Indian Contract Act, which came into effect on 1 September 1872 and extends to all India. It governs entrance into contract, and effects of breach of contract.
Indian Contract law is popularly known as mercantile law of India. Originally Indian Sales of Goods Act and Partnership Act were part of Indian Contract act, but due to needed amendment these acts were separated from Contract Act. The Contract act occupies the most important place in legal agreements in India.

== Labour law ==

Indian labour law are among the most comprehensive in the world. They have been criticised by the World Bank, primarily on the grounds of the inflexibility that results from government needing to approve dismissals. In practice, there is a large informal sector of workers, between 80 or 90 per cent of the labour force, to whom labour rights are not actually available and laws are not enforced.

== Company law ==

The current Indian company law was updated and recodified in the Companies Act 2013.

== Tort law ==

Tort law in India is primarily governed by judicial precedent as in other common law jurisdictions, supplemented by statutes governing damages, civil procedure, and codifying common law torts. As in other common law jurisdictions, a tort is breach of a non-contractual duty which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving rise to a civil cause of action and for which remedy is available. If a remedy does not exist, a tort has not been committed since the rationale of tort law is to provide a remedy to the person who has been wronged.

While Indian tort law is generally derived from English law, there are certain differences between the two systems. Indian tort law uniquely includes remedies for constitutional torts, which are actions by the government that infringe upon rights enshrined in the Constitution, as well as a system of absolute liability for businesses engaged in hazardous activity.

As tort law is similar in nature across common law jurisdictions, courts have readily referred to case law from other common law jurisdictions such as the UK, Australia, and Canada in addition to domestic precedent. However, attention is given to local norms and conditions, as well as India&#x27;s distinct constitutional framework in applying foreign precedent. The legislature have also created statutes to provide for certain social conditions. Similar to other common law countries, aspects of tort law have been codified.

Certain conduct which gives rise to a cause of action under tort law is additionally criminalised by the Indian Penal Code or other criminal legislation. Where a tort also constitutes a criminal offence, its prosecution by the state does not preclude the aggrieved party from seeking a remedy under tort law. The overlap between the two areas of law is a result of the distinct purposes each serves and the nature of the remedies each provides. Tort law aims to hold a tortfeasor accountable and consequently tort actions are brought directly by the aggrieved party in order to seek damages, whereas criminal law aims to punish and deter conduct deemed to be against the interests of society and criminal actions are thus brought by the state and penalties include imprisonment, fines, or execution.

In India, as in the majority of common law jurisdictions, the standard of proof in tort cases is the balance of probabilities as opposed to the reasonable doubt standard used in criminal cases or the preponderance of the evidence standard used in American tort litigation, although the latter is extremely similar in practice to the balance of probabilities standard. Similar to the constitutional presumption of innocence in Indian criminal law, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in tort actions in India. India, like the majority of common law jurisdictions in Asia and Africa, does not permit the use of juries in civil or criminal trials, in direct contrast to America and the Canadian common law provinces which retain civil juries as well as to jurisdictions like England and Wales or New Zealand which permit juries in a limited set of tort actions.

== Property law==
== Tax law ==
Indian tax law involves several different taxes levied by different governments. Income Tax is levied by the Central Government under the Income Tax Act 1961. Customs and excise duties are also levied by the Central government. Sales tax is levied under VAT legislation at the state level. Since a new tax reform in the form of GST was levied through constitutional amendment and came into existence since 1 July 2017 which took the place of excise duties and VAT.

The authority to levy a tax is derived from the Constitution of India which allocates the power to levy various taxes between the Centre and the State. An important restriction on this power is Article 265 of the Constitution which states that &quot;No tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law.&quot; Therefore, each tax levied or collected has to be backed by an accompanying law, passed either by the Parliament or the State Legislature. In 2010–11, the gross tax collection amounted to 7.92 billion (Long scale), with direct tax and indirect tax contributing 56% and 44% respectively.

=== Central Board of Direct Taxes ===
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is a part of the Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. The CBDT provides essential inputs for policy and planning of direct taxes in India and is also responsible for administration of the direct tax laws through Income Tax Department. The CBDT is a statutory authority functioning under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963. It is India&#x27;s official FATF unit. The Central Board of Revenue as the department apex body charged with the administration of taxes came into existence as a result of the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1924. Initially the Board was in charge of both direct and indirect taxes. However, when the administration of taxes became too unwieldy for one Board to handle, the Board was split up into two, namely the Central Board of Direct Taxes and Central Board of Excise and Customs with effect from 1 January 1964. This bifurcation was brought about by constitution of the two Boards u/s 3 of the Central Boards of Revenue Act, 1963.

=== Income Tax Act of 1961 ===
The major tax enactment is the &quot;Income Tax Act &quot; of 1961 passed by the Parliament, which establishes and governs the taxation of the incomes of individuals and corporations. This Act imposes a tax on income under the following five heads:
* Income from house and property,
* Income from business and profession,
* Income from salaries,
* Income in the form of Capital gains, and
* Income from other sources

However, this Act may soon be repealed and be replaced with a new Act consolidating the law relating to Income Tax and Wealth Tax, the new proposed legislation is called the Direct Taxes Code (to become the Direct Taxes Code, Act 2010). Act was referred to Parliamentary standing committee which has submitted its recommendations. Act was expected to be implemented with changes from the Financial Year 2013–14 but was never enacted.

=== Goods and Services Tax ===
Goods and Services Tax (India) is a comprehensive indirect tax on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and services throughout India to replace taxes levied by the central and state governments. It was introduced as The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016, following the passage of Constitution 101st Amendment Bill. The GST is governed by GST Council and its chairman is Nirmala Sitaraman, Finance Minister of India.

This method allows GST - registered businesses to claim tax credit to the value of GST they paid on purchase of goods or services as part of their normal commercial activity. Administrative responsibility would generally rest with a single authority to levy tax on goods and services. Exports would be considered as zero-rated supply and imports would be levied the same taxes as domestic goods and services adhering to the destination principle in addition to the Customs Duty which will not be subsumed in the GST.

Introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a significant step in the reform of indirect taxation in India. Amalgamating several Central and State taxes into a single tax would mitigate cascading or double taxation, facilitating a common national market. The simplicity of the tax should lead to easier administration and enforcement. From the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%, free movement of goods from one state to another without stopping at state borders for hours for payment of state tax or entry tax and reduction in paperwork to a large extent.

GST came into effect on 1 July 2017.

== Trust law ==
Trust law in India is mainly codified in the Indian Trusts Act of 1882, which came into force on 1 March 1882. It extends to the whole of India except for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Indian law follows principles of English law in most areas of law, but the law of trusts is a notable exception. Indian law does not recognize &quot;double ownership&quot;, and a beneficiary of trust property is not the equitable owner of the property in Indian law.

== Family law – personal law ==

Family laws in India are different when Warren Hastings in 1772 created provisions prescribing Hindu law for Hindus and Islamic law for Muslims, for litigation relating to personal matters. However, after independence, efforts have been made to modernise various aspects of personal law and bring about uniformity among various religions. Recent reform has affected custody and guardianship laws, adoption laws, succession laws, and laws concerning domestic violence and child marriage.

=== Hindu Law ===

As far as Hindus are concerned &quot;Hindu Law&quot; is a specific branch of law. Though the attempt made by the first parliament after independence did not succeed in bringing forth a Hindu Code comprising the entire field of Hindu family law, laws could be enacted touching upon all major areas that affect family life among Hindus in India. Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists are also covered by Hindu law.

=== Muslim law ===
Indian Muslims&#x27; personal laws are based upon the Sharia, which is thus partially applied in India, and laws and legal judgements adapting and adjusting Sharia for Indian society. The portion of the &quot;fiqh&quot; applicable to Indian Muslims as personal law is termed Mohammedan law. Despite being largely uncodified, Mohammedan law has the same legal status as other codified statutes. The development of the law is largely on the basis of judicial precedent, which in recent times has been subject to review by the courts. The concept of the judicial precedent and of &#x27;review by the courts&#x27; is a key component of the British common law upon which Indian law is based. The contribution of Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer in the matter of interpretation of the statutory as well as personal law is significant.

Sunni Law:
* Quran
* Sunna or Ahdis (Tradition of the Prophet)
* Ijma (Unanimous Decision of the Jurists)
* Qiyas ( Analogical deduction)

As per Shia Law:

Usooli Shia
* Quran
* Tradition (only those that have come from the family of the Prophet)
* Ijma (only those confirmed by Imams)
* Reasons

Akhbari Shia
* Tradition (only those that have come from the family of the Prophet)

Polygamy is a subject of debate from long time. It has been abolished in many Islamic countries, but still holds its legal validity in the secular country of India. Supreme court asked the central government for its views, to which it replied that polygamy should be done away with.

=== Christian Law ===

For Christians, a distinct branch of law known as Christian Law, mostly based on specific statutes, applies.

Christian law of Succession and Divorce in India have undergone changes in recent years. The Indian Divorce (Amendment) Act of 2001 has brought in considerable changes in the grounds available for divorce. By now Christian law in India has emerged as a separate branch of law. It covers the entire spectrum of family law so far as it concerns Christians in India. Christian law, to a great extent is based on English law but there are laws that originated on the strength of customary practices and precedents.

Christian family law has now distinct sub branches like laws on marriage, divorce, restitution, judicial separation, succession, adoption, guardianship, maintenance, custody of minor children and relevance of canon law and all that regulates familial relationship.

=== Parsi law ===

The Parsi law is the law governing the Parsi Zoroastrian community.

== Nationality law ==

Nationality law or citizenship law is mainly codified in the Constitution of India and the Citizenship Act of 1955. Although the Constitution of India bars multiple citizenship, the Parliament of India passed on 7 January 2004, a law creating a new form of very limited dual nationality called &quot;Overseas Citizenship of India&quot;. Overseas citizens of India have no form of political rights or participation in the government, however, and there are no plans to issue to overseas citizens any form of Indian passport.

== Law enforcement ==

Law enforcement in India is undertaken by numerous law enforcement agencies. Like many federal structures, the nature of the Constitution of India mandates law and order as a subject of the state, therefore the bulk of the policing lies with the respective states and territories of India.

At the federal level, the many agencies are part of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, and support the states in their duties. Larger cities also operate metropolitan police forces, under respective state governments. All senior police officers in the state police forces, as well as those in the federal agencies, are members of the Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Revenue Service (IRS), two of the several kinds of civil services. They are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission.

=== Police Force ===
The federal police are controlled by the central Government of India. The majority of federal law enforcement agencies are controlled by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The head of each of the federal law enforcement agencies is always an Indian Police Service officer (IPS). The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order to the states and territories, and almost all routine policing—including apprehension of criminals—is carried out by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organization by authorizing the maintenance of the Indian Police Service.

== Law reforms ==
Government usually appoints Law Commission panels to study and make non-binding recommendations for the law reform. In first 65 years 1,301 obsolete laws were repealed, including 1029 old laws in 1950 by Jawaharlal Nehru and 272 old laws in 2004 by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. After that 1,824 such laws were repealed by Narendra Modi government between May 2014 to December 2017, taking the total to 3,125.

== Subordinate legislation in India ==
Subordinate, delegated or secondary legislation covers rules, regulations, by-laws, sub-rules, orders, and notification.

* rule: according to the General Clauses Acts, 1897, &quot;rule&quot; shall mean a rule made in exercise of a power conferred by any enactment, and shall include a Regulation made as a rule under any enactment.

<text>Ary Scheffer (10 February 179515 June 1858) was a Dutch-French Romantic painter. He was known mostly for his works based on literature, with paintings based on the works of Dante, Goethe, Lord Byron and Walter Scott, as well as religious subjects. He was also a prolific painter of portraits of famous and influential people in his lifetime. Politically, Scheffer had strong ties to King Louis Philippe I, having been employed as a teacher of the latter&#x27;s children, which allowed him to live a life of luxury for many years until the French Revolution of 1848.

==Life==
Scheffer was the son of Johan Bernard Scheffer (1765–1809), a portrait painter who was born in Homberg upon Ohm or Cassel (both presently in Germany; the latter has been spelled as Kassel since 1926) and moved to the Netherlands in his youth, and Cornelia Lamme (1769–1839), a portrait miniature painter and daughter of landscape painter Arie Lamme of Dordrecht, for whom Arij (later &quot;Ary&quot;) was named. Ary Scheffer had two brothers, the journalist and writer Karel Arnold Scheffer (1796–1853) and the painter Hendrik Scheffer (1798–1862). His parents educated him and he attended the drawing academy in Amsterdam from the age of 11 years. In 1808 his father became the court painter of Louis Bonaparte in Amsterdam, yet his father died one year later. Encouraged by Willem Bilderdijk, Ary moved to Lille, France, for further study after the death of his father. In 1811 he and his mother, who greatly influenced his career, moved to Paris, France, where he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts as a pupil of Pierre-Narcisse Guérin. His brothers followed them to Paris later.

Scheffer started exhibiting at the Salon de Paris in 1812. He began to be recognized in 1817, and in 1819 he was asked to make a portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette. Perhaps because of Lafayette&#x27;s acquaintances, Scheffer and his brothers were politically active throughout their lives and he became a prominent Philhellene.

In 1822 he became drawing teacher to the children of Louis Philippe I, the Duke of Orléans. Because of his connection with them, he obtained many commissions for portraiture and other work. In 1830 riots against the rule of King Charles X resulted in his overthrow. On 30 July, Scheffer and influential journalist Adolphe Thiers rode from Paris to Orléans to ask Louis Philippe I to lead the resistance, and a few days later he became &quot;King of the French&quot;.

That same year, Scheffer&#x27;s daughter Cornélia was born. He registered the name of her mother as &quot;Maria Johanna de Nes&quot;, but nothing is known of her and she may have died soon after Cornelia&#x27;s birth. Considering that his grandmother&#x27;s name was &quot;Johanna de Nes&quot;, it has been speculated that he kept the name of Cornelia&#x27;s mother secret so as not to compromise the reputation of a noble family. Cornelia Scheffer (1830–1899) became a sculptor and painter in her own right. Scheffer&#x27;s mother did not know of her namesake granddaughter until 1837, after which she cared for her until she died only two years later. Scheffer became an associate member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1846, and resigned in 1851.
 Scheffer and his family prospered during the reign of Louis Philippe I, who abdicated on 24 February 1848. Scheffer and Hendrik were inundated with artistic commissions, and they taught numerous students in their workshop in Paris, so many that of the works produced during this period that bear his signature the number that he actually made himself cannot be verified.

Scheffer was elevated as commander of the Legion of Honour in 1848. As a captain of the Garde Nationale he escorted the French royal family in its escape from the Tuileries and escorted the Duchess d&#x27;Orléans to the Chambre des Députés, where she in vain proposed her son as the next monarch of France. Scheffer fought in the army of Cavaignac during the June Days Uprising in Paris of 23 to 26 June 1848. The cruelty and hatred that the governmental faction exhibited and the misery of the lower classes so shocked him that he withdrew from politics and refused to make portraits of the family of Napoléon III, who reigned after the Uprising. On 16 March 1850 he married Sophie Marin, the widow of General Baudrand, and on 6 November of that year he finally became a French citizen. He continued to frequently travel to the Netherlands, and traveled to Belgium, Germany, and England, but a heart condition impaired his activity and eventually caused his death in 1858 in his summer house in Argenteuil. He is buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre.

==Works==
When Scheffer left Guérin&#x27;s studio, Romanticism had come into vogue in France, with such painters as Xavier Sigalon, Eugène Delacroix and Théodore Géricault. Scheffer did not show much affinity with their work and developed his own style, which has been called &quot;frigidly classical&quot;.

Scheffer often painted subjects from literature, especially the works of Dante, Byron and Goethe. Two versions of &quot;Dante and Beatrice&quot; have been preserved at Wolverhampton Art Gallery, United Kingdom, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, US. His &quot;L&#x27;Enterrement du Jeune Pêcheur&quot;, illustrating a scene from Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Antiquary&quot; and taking inspiration from David Wilkie&#x27;s &quot;Distraining for Rent&quot;, was exhibited at the Salon of 1824. Particularly highly praised was his &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;, painted in 1836, which illustrates a scene from Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. In the piece the entwined bodies of Francesca di Rimini and Paolo Malatesta swirl around in the never-ending tempest that is the second circle of Hell. The illusion of movement is created by the drapery that envelopes the couple, as well as by Francesca&#x27;s flowing hair. These two figures create a diagonal line that intersects the majority of the canvas creating not only a sense of movement, but also giving the painting an air of instability. Francesca clings to Paolo as he turns his face away in anguish. There are an additional two figures in the image: hidden in the background, the poets Dante and Virgil look on as they make their way through the nine circles of Hell.

Scheffer&#x27;s popular Faust-themed paintings include &quot;Margaret at her wheel&quot;; &quot;Faust doubting&quot;; &quot;Margaret at the Sabbat&quot;; &quot;Margaret leaving church&quot;; &quot;The garden walk&quot;, and &quot;Margaret at the well&quot;. In 1836, he painted two pictures of Goethe&#x27;s character &quot;Mignon&quot;: &quot;Mignon desires her fatherland&quot; (1836), and &quot;Mignon yearns for heaven&quot; (1851).
He now turned to religious subjects: &quot;Christus Consolator&quot; (1836) was followed by &quot;Christus Remunerator&quot;, &quot;The shepherds led by the star&quot; (1837), &quot;The Magi laying down their crowns&quot;, &quot;Christ in the Garden of Olives&quot;, &quot;Christ bearing his Cross&quot;, &quot;Christ interred&quot; (1845), and &quot;St Augustine and Monica&quot; (1846).

One of the reduced versions of his &quot;Christus Consolator&quot; (the prime version today to be found in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam), lost for 70 years, was rediscovered in a janitor&#x27;s closet in Gethsemane Lutheran Church in Dassel, Minnesota, in 2007. It has been restored and is on display at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

Scheffer was also an accomplished portrait painter, finishing 500 portraits in total. His subjects included composers Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, the Marquis de la Fayette, Pierre-Jean de Béranger, Alphonse de Lamartine, Charles Dickens, Duchess de Broglie, Talleyrand and Queen Marie Amélie.

After 1846, he ceased to exhibit. His strong ties with the royal family caused him to fall out of favour when, in 1848, the Second Republic came into being. Scheffer was made commander of the Legion of Honour in 1848, that is, after he had wholly withdrawn from the Salon. Shut up in his studio, he produced many paintings that were only exhibited after his death in 1858.

The works first exhibited posthumously include &quot;Sorrows of the earth&quot;, and the &quot;Angel announcing the Resurrection&quot;, which he had left unfinished. By the time of his death, his reputation was damaged and was further undermined by the sale of the Paturle Gallery, which contained many of his most celebrated achievements: though his paintings were praised for their charm and facility, they were condemned for poor use of color and vapid sentiment.

==Friends and family==

At various times Maurice Sand, Scheffer, Charles Gounod, Hector Berlioz were in relationships with Pauline Viardot—in letters they claimed that they were in love with her. She wrote in one letter:
 She was married to Louis Viardot at 18 years old, when her husband was a director of an Italian opera house in Paris and a friend of Scheffer. Scheffer was a confidant of Pauline Viardot and a friend of her family until his death.

In 1850 Scheffer became a French citizen and married Sophie Marin, the widow of General Marie Étienne François Henri Baudrand. Marin died in 1856.

His younger brother Hendrik Scheffer, born in The Hague on 27 September 1798, was also a painter.

<doc id="824083" wikidata="Q415739" url="?curid=824083" title="Cefazolin">
<text>Cefazolin, also known as cefazoline and cephazolin, is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. Specifically it is used to treat cellulitis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, joint infection, and biliary tract infections. It is also used to prevent group B streptococcal disease around the time of delivery and before surgery. It is typically given by injection into a muscle or vein.
Common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, yeast infections, and allergic reactions. Historically, it was thought to be contraindicated in patients with allergies to penicillin, although several recent studies have refuted this and it is proven to be safe in almost all patients, including those with known penicillin allergies. It is relatively safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Cefazolin is in the first-generation cephalosporin class of medication and works by interfering with the bacteria&#x27;s cell wall.
Cefazolin was patented in 1967 and came into commercial use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Cefazolin is used in a variety of infections provided that susceptible organisms are involved. It is indicated for use in the following infections:
* Respiratory tract infections
* Urinary tract infections
* Skin infections
* Biliary tract infections
* Bone and joint infections
* Genital infections
* Blood infections (sepsis)
* Endocarditis
It can also be used peri-operatively to prevent infections post-surgery, and is often the preferred drug for surgical prophylaxis.

There is no penetration into the central nervous system and therefore cefazolin is not effective in treating meningitis.

Cefazolin has been shown to be effective in treating methicillin-susceptible &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MSSA) but does not work in cases of methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). In many instances of staphylococcal infections, such as bacteremia, cefazolin is an alternative to penicillin in patients who are allergic to penicillin. However, there is still potential for a reaction to occur with cefazolin and other cephalosporins in patients allergic to penicillin. Resistance to cefazolin is seen in several species of bacteria, such as &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and &quot;Chlamydia&quot;, in which case different generations of cephalosporins may be more effective. Cefazolin does not fight against &quot;Enterococcus&quot;, anaerobic bacteria, or atypical bacteria, among others.

=== Bacterial susceptibility ===
As a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, cefazolin and other first-generation antibiotics are very active against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria. Their broad spectrum of activity can be attributed to their improved stability to many bacterial beta-lactamases compared to penicillins.

=== Spectrum of activity ===

Gram-positive aerobes:
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (including beta-lactamase producing strains)
* &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;
* &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and other strains of streptococci

Gram-Negative Aerobes:

* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
* &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;
* &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;

=== Non susceptible===
The following are not susceptible: 
* Methicillin-resistant &quot;staphylococcus aureus&quot;
* &quot;Enterococcus&quot;
* most strains of indole positive &quot;Proteus&quot; (&quot;Proteus vulgaris&quot;)
* &quot;Enterobacter spp&quot;.
* &quot;Morganella morganii&quot;
* &quot;Providencia rettgeri&quot;
* &quot;Serratia spp&quot;.
* &quot;Pseudomonas spp&quot;.
* &quot;Listeria&quot;

==Special populations==

=== Pregnancy ===
Cefazolin is pregnancy category B, indicating general safety for use in pregnancy. Caution should be used in breastfeeding as a small amount of cefazolin enters the breast milk. Cefazolin can be used prophylactically against perinatal Group B streptococcal infection (GBS). Although penicillin and ampicillin are the standard of care for GBS prophylaxis, penicillin-allergic women with no history of anaphylaxis can be given cefazolin instead. These patients should be closely monitored as there is a small chance of an allergic reaction due to the similar structure of the antibiotics.

=== Newborns ===
There has been no established safety and effectiveness for use in premature infants and neonates.

=== Elderly ===

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in clinical trials comparing elderly and younger subjects, however the trials could not eliminate the possibility that some older individuals may have a higher level of sensitivity.

===Additional considerations===
People with kidney disease and those on hemodialysis may need the dose adjusted. Cefazolin levels are not significantly affected by liver disease.

As with other antibiotics, cefazolin may interact with other medications being taken. Some important drugs that may interact with cefazolin such as probenecid.

==Side effects==
Side effects associated with use of cefazolin therapy include:
* Common (1–10%): diarrhea, stomach pain or upset stomach, vomiting, and rash. 
* Uncommon (&lt;1%): dizziness, headache, fatigue, itching, transient hepatitis.
Patients with penicillin allergies could experience a potential reaction to cefazolin and other cephalosporins. As with other antibiotics, patients experiencing watery and/or bloody stools occurring up to three months following therapy should contact their prescriber.

Like those of several other cephalosporins, the chemical structure of cefazolin contains an N-methylthiodiazole (NMTD or 1-MTD) side-chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTD, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Those with an allergy to penicillin may develop a cross sensitivity to cefazolin.

== Mechanism of action ==
Cefazolin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding penicillin-binding proteins which stops peptidoglycan synthesis. Penicillin-binding proteins are bacterial proteins that help to catalyze the last stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, which is needed to maintain the cell wall. They remove the D-alanine from the precursor of the peptidoglycan. The lack of synthesis causes the bacteria to lyse because they also continually break down their cell walls. Cefazolin is bactericidal, meaning it kills the bacteria rather than inhibiting their growth.

==Cost==
Cefazolin is relatively inexpensive.

==Trade names==
It was initially marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the trade name Nostof.

Other trade names include: Cefacidal, Cefamezin, Cefrina, Elzogram, Faxilen, Gramaxin, Kefol, Kefzol, Kefzolan, Kezolin, Novaporin, Reflin, Zinol, and Zolicef.

<text>India has a number of intelligence agencies, of which the best known are the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India&#x27;s external intelligence agency, and the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the domestic intelligence agency, responsible for counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism and overall internal security.

==National Technical Research Organization==

The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) is a technical intelligence agency under the National Security Advisor in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, India. It was set up in 2004. It also includes the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) and the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD) for cryptologic education and research, which is first of its kind in Asia.

==Research and Analysis Wing==

Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW) is the primary foreign intelligence agency of India. The agency&#x27;s primary function is gathering foreign intelligence, counter-terrorism, counterproliferation, advising Indian policymakers, and advancing India&#x27;s foreign strategic interests. It is also involved in the security of India&#x27;s nuclear programme.

===Aviation Research Centre===
The Aviation Research Centre (ARC) is a part of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW) of the Cabinet Secretariat (Special Requirements) India. The first head of the ARC was R. N. Kao, the founding chief of R&amp;AW. Over the years the ARC has grown into a large operation and flies a large and varied fleet.
Aerial surveillance, SIGINT operations, photo reconnaissance flights (PHOTINT), monitoring of borders, imagery intelligence (IMINT) are the main functions of the Aviation Research Centre (ARC). The aircraft are fitted with state-of-the-art electronic surveillance equipment and long range cameras capable of taking pictures of targets from very high altitudes. ARC also takes the responsibility along with the IAF to transport Special Frontier Force (SFF) commandos from their trans-location at Sarsawa, 250 km north of New Delhi, though the SFF&#x27;s own base is in Chakrata in Uttarakhand state.

===Radio Research Centre===
The Radio Research Centre (RRC) is a part of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW) of the Cabinet Secretariat (Special Requirements) India. The RRC is a premier communication and signal intelligence agency of India. RRC&#x27;s tasks include – communication with the embassies abroad, send cyphered code to agents stationed abroad, interception fixed line and wireless communication and the department closely works with the Joint Cypher Bureau. The RRC has offices all across the country and the perform the intercepts communication and sends code.

===Electronics and Technical Services===

The Electronics and Technical Services (ETS) is the Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) arm of India&#x27;s external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW). Established in the mid-1980s under the leadership of then R&amp;AW&#x27;s chief N. F. Suntook, the organisation, it is housed in the CGO complex in New Delhi. ETS is believed to be involved in ELINT roles, not restricted but also includes jamming and spoofing - Electronic Warfare (EW). ETS also involved in Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESMs), Telemetry (TELINT), Tracking and monitoring data links, interception and monitoring of navigation signals and other ELINT and EW methods.

==Intelligence Bureau==

The Intelligence Bureau (IB) is India&#x27;s internal intelligence agency. The Intelligence Bureau (IB) (Hindi: आसूचना ब्यूरो; IAST: āsūcanā byūro) is India&#x27;s domestic internal security and counter-intelligence agency under Ministry of Home Affairs. It was founded in 1887 as Serval Intelligence Branch, and is reputed to be the oldest such organization in the world.

==National Investigation Agency==
==National Cyber Coordination Centre==

The National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) is an operational cybersecurity and e-surveillance agency in India. It is intended to screen communication metadata and co-ordinate the intelligence gathering activities of other agencies.

==Directorate of Revenue Intelligence==

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is an Indian intelligence agency. It is India&#x27;s apex anti-smuggling intelligence, investigations and operations agency. The DRI is run by officers from the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) who are posted in its various Zonal Units as well as in Indian embassies abroad as part of the Customs Overseas Intelligence Network. It is headed by a Director General of the rank of Special Secretary to the Government of India. The Agency works to secure India&#x27;s national and economic security by preventing the outright smuggling of contraband such as firearms, gold, narcotics, counterfeit Indian currency notes, antiques, wildlife and environmental products. Moreover, it also works to prevent the proliferation of black money, trade based money laundering and commercial frauds.

==Joint Cipher Bureau==
==All India Radio Monitoring Service==

All India Radio Monitoring Service (AIRMS) is the central monitoring service that monitors broadcasts in India as well as from all foreign broadcasts of Interest to India. AIRMS is located in Shimla. It works in liaison with R&amp;AW and Military intelligence.

==Defence Intelligence Agency==

The Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) was established on 5 March 2002 with the appointment of Lt. General Kamal Davar as the first Director General (DG). The DG reports to the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). It is supposed to be the nodal agency for all defence-related intelligence, thus distinguishing it from the R&amp;AW. Much of the agency&#x27;s budget and operations are classified.

DIA has control of MoD&#x27;s prized technical intelligence assets – the Directorate of Signals Intelligence and the Defence Image Processing and Analysis Centre (DIPAC). While the Signals Directorate is responsible for acquiring and decrypting enemy communications, the DIPAC controls India&#x27;s satellite-based image acquisition capabilities. The DIA also controls the Defence Information Warfare Agency (DIWA) which handles all elements of the information warfare repertoire, including psychological operations, cyber-war, electronic intercepts and the monitoring of sound waves. Before the creation of the Defence Intelligence Agency, the military intelligence capability of India&#x27;s armed forces was limited to Field Intelligence Units (FIU) and separate intelligence arms of the services. These distinct services were not able to effectively coordinate intelligence operations and sharing of information. The armed forces also heavily relied on civilian intelligence agencies such as the Research and Analysis Wing and the Intelligence Bureau. With wide-ranging resources and functions, the DIA will be superior to and coordinate the Directorate of Military Intelligence, Directorate of Air Intelligence and the Directorate of Naval Intelligence.

==Signals Intelligence Directorate==
The Signals Intelligence Directorate is a joint service organisation, composed of personnel from the Army, Navy and Air Force. It has a large number of Wireless Experimental Units (WEUs) that carry out the task of monitoring military links of other countries.

==Central Monitoring Organisation==

<doc id="824108" wikidata="Q3610803" url="?curid=824108" title="Alexander Thomson">
<text>Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson (9 April 1817 – 22 March 1875) was an eminent Scottish architect and architectural theorist who was a pioneer in sustainable building. Although his work was published in the architectural press of his day, it was little appreciated outside Glasgow during his lifetime. It has only been since the 1950s and 1960s that his critical reputation has revived—not least of all in connection with his probable influence on Frank Lloyd Wright.

Henry-Russell Hitchcock wrote of Thomson in 1966: &quot;Glasgow in the last 150 years has had two of the greatest architects of the Western world. C. R. Mackintosh was not highly productive but his influence in central Europe was comparable to such American architects as Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. An even greater and happily more productive architect, though one whose influence can only occasionally be traced in America in Milwaukee and in New York City and not at all as far as I know in Europe, was Alexander Thomson&quot;.

==Early life==

Thomson was born in the village of Balfron in Stirlingshire. The son of John Thomson, a bookkeeper, and Elizabeth Cooper Thomson, he was the ninth of twelve children. His father, who already had eight grown children from his previous marriage, died when Alexander was seven. 

The family consequently moved to the outskirts of Glasgow, but tragedy struck when the eldest daughter, Jane, and three of her brothers died between 1828 and 1830, the year that Alexander&#x27;s mother died. The remaining children moved with one of the older brothers, William, a teacher, and his wife and child to Hangingshaw, just south of Glasgow. 

The Thomson boys all worked from a young age, but the children were also home schooled. Alexander&#x27;s older brother, Ebenezer, was employed as a bookkeeper in a lawyer&#x27;s office, possibly Wilson, James, and Kays, and later became a partner in the business.

==Career==
Alexander Thomson began work in 1834, as a clerk in a lawyers office in Glasgow. One of their clients was an architect, Robert Foote, who was impressed by seeing Thomson&#x27;s drawings and took him on as an articled apprentice. He learnt a great deal from getting access to Foote&#x27;s extensive library and collection of classical casts, but in 1836 Foote had to retire due to illness. To complete his articles, Thomson became apprenticed to the architect John Baird, initially as an assistant, and later became chief draughtsman. Thomson&#x27;s younger brother George got apprenticed to Baird in the early 1840s.

In September 1847 Thomson married Jane Nicholson, and on the same day her sister married another architect, John Baird (unrelated to Thomson&#x27;s employer, and referred to by biographers as John Baird II), who fell out with his previous partner. In 1848 Thomson joined him in a new partnership, the practice of Baird &amp; Thomson. 

In 1857, as &quot;the rising architectural star of Glasgow,&quot; he entered into practice with his brother George where he was to enjoy the most productive years of his life. He served as president of both the Glasgow Architectural Society and the Glasgow Institute of Architects. Thomson was an elder of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and his deep religious convictions informed his work. There is a strong suggestion that he closely identified Solomon&#x27;s Temple with the raised basilica of the same form of his three major churches.

He produced a diverse range of structures including villas, a castle, urbane terraces, commercial warehouses, tenements, and three extraordinary churches. Of these, Caledonia Road Church (1856–57) is now a ruin,
Queen&#x27;s Park United Presbyterian Church (1869) was destroyed in WWII, and St Vincent Street Church (1859) is the only intact survivor. Hitchcock once stated, &quot;&quot;[Thomson has built] three of the finest Romantic Classical churches in the world&quot;”. Thomson developed his own highly idiosyncratic style from Greek, Egyptian and Levantine sources and freely adapted them to the needs of the modern city.
At the age of 34, Thomson designed his first and only castle, Craigrownie Castle, which stands at the tip of the Rosneath Peninsula in Cove, overlooking Loch Long. The six-storey structure is Scots Baronial in style, featuring a central tower with battlements, steep gables and oriel windows, in addition to a chapel and a mews cottage.

Thomson&#x27;s villa designs were realized at Langside, Pollokshields, Helensburgh, Cove, the Clyde Estuary, and on the Isle of Bute. His &quot;mature villas are Grecian in style while resembling no other Greek Revival houses...[and they] are dominated by horizontal lines and rest on a strong podium.&quot; According to Gavin Stamp, &quot;Thomson carefully designed his villas with symmetries within an overall asymmetry in a personal language in which the horizontal discipline of a continuous governing order—whether expressed or implied—was never abandoned. Regarding similarities to Frank Lloyd Wright, Stamp states, &quot;It has often been remarked that there are clear resemblances between the early houses of the Prairie School and Thomson&#x27;s horizontally massed design, with its low-pitched gables and spreading eaves -- together with a connecting garden.&quot; As Sir John Summerson noted, &quot;There is something wildly &#x27;American&#x27; about Thomson -- a &#x27;New World&#x27; attitude. You can see it in the villas...a sort of primitivism, ultra-Tuscan.&quot;

Later in his career he would abandon his eclecticism and adopt the purely Ionic Greek style for which he is best known, as such he is perhaps the last in a continuous tradition of British Greek Revival architects. In attacking the Gothic, he &quot;insisted that &#x27;Stonehenge is really more scientifically constructed than York Minster&#x27;...[alluding to] Pugin&#x27;s comment that in their temples &#x27;the Greeks erected their columns like the uprights of Stonehenge&#x27;.&quot; Other important works still standing include Moray Place, Great Western Terrace, Egyptian Halls in Union Street, Grosvenor Building, Buck&#x27;s Head Building in Argyle Street, Grecian Buildings in Sauchiehall Street, Walmer and Millbrae Crescents, and his villa, Holmwood House, at Cathcart. Grave monuments designed by Thomson that are worthy of study include those to the Revd. A.O. Beattie and the Revd. G.M. Middleton, as well as that for John McIntyre in Cathcart Old Parish Cemetery.

Thomson was a visionary who introduced into our vocabulary some of the essential elements of sustainable housing. This argument hinges on an unrealized design Thomson prepared in 1868 for the Glasgow City Improvement Trust, an agency of the Town Council given the task of redeveloping a large area of slum housing centred on the medieval Old Town. The Trust invited Thomson and five other prominent architects to propose designs for the reconstruction of various parcels of land along the spine of Glasgow&#x27;s High Street. Thomson suggested that closely spaced parallel tenements be built within the central courtyard, the ends of which will be open to facilitate ventilation. He also proposed that alternate streets be glazed for better warmth and safety for the residents. Although Thomson&#x27;s ideas failed to catch on at the time, new research and CAD techniques have helped show how revolutionary was his proposal for improved workers&#x27; housing.

==Writings==
Thomson&#x27;s published writings include the Haldane lectures on the history of architecture (1874) and the &quot;Inquiry as to the Appropriateness of the Gothic Style for the Proposed building for the University of Glasgow&quot; (1866) which attempted to refute Ruskin and Pugin’s claims for the superiority of Gothic.

==Family==
On 21 September 1847, Thomson married Jane Nicholson, granddaughter of the architect Peter Nicholson, in a double wedding ceremony with her sister, Jessie, who married John Baird II. They had twelve children in total and would later lose five of them in an epidemic.

One brother, George Thomson (1819–1878), became a baptist missionary in Limbe, Cameroon (then known as &quot;Victoria&quot;), where he combined his religious activities with a passion for botany. An epiphytic orchid of the genus &quot;Pachystoma&quot; was named &quot;Pachystoma thomsonianum&quot; in his honour. It is now known as &quot;Ancistrochilus thomsonianus&quot;.

His nephew, Rev. William Cooper Thomson (1829-1878) was a missionary in Nigeria, after whose first wife the bleeding-heart vine &quot;Clerodendrum thomsoniae&quot; was named.

==Death==

Thomson died on 22 March 1875 at his home in Moray Place in Strathbungo, Glasgow, fittingly in one of his own creations. The architect was buried in the lair adjacent to that in which his five deceased children were laid to rest, in Gorbals Southern Necropolis, on 26 March 1875, and he was joined there by his widow, Jane, in 1889.

His obituary appeared in &quot;Building News&quot; on 26 March 1875, written by his friend, Thomas Gildard, who also wrote his biography.

==Legacy==

The Glasgow Institute of Architects set up The Alexander Thomson Memorial immediately following his death. A marble bust of the architect by John Mossman was presented to the Corporation Galleries, Sauchiehall Street, and is now displayed in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. The Alexander Thomson Travelling Studentship, of which the second winner was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was established in his honor, &quot;for the purpose of providing a travelling studentship for the furtherance of the study of ancient classic architecture, with special reference to the principles illustrated in Mr. Thomson’s works&quot;.

Thomson was the pre-eminent architect of his era in Glasgow, yet until recently, his buildings and his reputation have been largely neglected in the city graced by his works.

Holmwood House is generally considered to be Thomson&#x27;s finest and most original residential subject. Under the ownership of the National Trust for Scotland, Holmwood has been restored to its original condition and opened to the general public. During the renovation, nineteen panels of a classical frieze depicting scenes from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; were discovered under layers of paint and wallpaper, rendering Thomson&#x27;s nickname all the more apt.

In 1999, a retrospective entitled &quot;Alexander Thomson: The Unknown Genius&quot; was held at The Lighthouse, reminding Glaswegians of the need to preserve the remaining examples of this unique architect&#x27;s contribution to their city.

The British emigre architect George Ashdown Audsley closely followed Thomson&#x27;s ornamentation for several of his secular buildings. The most notable surviving example is his Bowling Green Offices (completed 1896) in New York City. The highly carved granite base of this tall office building is in the Thomson manner with brick Chicago School style floors above.

Thomson was featured on the obverse of a 1999 commemorative £20 bank note from Clydesdale Bank of Scotland dated with his birthday 9 April, marking Glasgow&#x27;s award that year as UK City of Architecture and Design. An interior view of the dome of Holmwood House, designed by Thomson, is the main motif on the reverse side. Five million notes were issued.

<text>The national highways in India are a network of limited access roads owned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. National highways have flyover access or some controlled-access, where entrance and exit is through the side of the flyover. At each highway intersection, flyovers are provided to bypass the traffic on the city, town, or village. These highways are designed for speeds of 100 km/h. Some national highways have interchanges in between, but do not have total controlled-access throughout the highways. The highways are constructed and managed by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL), and the public works departments (PWD) of state governments. Currently, the longest national highway in India is National Highway 44 at 4,112 km (2,555 mi). India started four laning of major national highways with the National Highway Development Project (NHDP). As of March 2022 India has approximately 35,000 km of four laned National highways.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) are the nodal agencies responsible for building, upgrading, and maintaining most of the National Highways network. It operates under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The National Highways Development Project (NHDP) is a major effort to expand and upgrade the network of highways. NHAI often uses a public–private partnership model for highway maintenance, and toll-collection. NHIDCL uses Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) model to build, develop and maintain strategic roads in international borders of the country.

In India, National Highways are at-grade roads, whereas Expressways are controlled-access highways where entrance and exit is controlled by the use ramps that are incorporated into the design of the expressway. National Highways follows standards set by Indian Roads Congress and Bureau of Indian Standards.

==Characteristics ==


India has of national highways as of March 2022 compared to 101,011 km in FY 2013–14. In July 2023, Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said total length of the national highways in the country increased by about &quot;59%&quot; in the last nine years.

National highways constituted 2.7% of India&#x27;s total road network, but carried about 40% of road traffic, as of 2013. In 2016, the government vowed to double the highway length from 101,011 to 200,000 km.

The majority of existing highways are now four-lane roads (two lanes in each direction), though much of this is being expanded to six or more lanes. Some sections of the network are toll roads. Only a few highways are built with concrete. Bypasses have been constructed around larger towns and cities to provide uninterrupted passage for highway traffic. Some existing roads have been reclassified as national highways.

== History ==

The National Highways Act, 1956 provided for public i.e. state investment in the building and maintenance of the highways.

The National Highways Authority of India was established by the National Highways Authority of India Act, 1988. Section 16(1) of the Act states that the function of NHAI is to develop, maintain, and manage the National Highways and any other highways vested in, or entrusted to, it by the Government of India.

In 1998 India launched a massive program of highway upgrades, called the National Highways Development Project (NHDP), in which the main north–south and east–west corridors and highways connecting the four metropolitan cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata) have been fully paved and widened into four-lane highways. Some of the busier National Highway sectors in India were also converted to four- or six-lane limited-access highways.

National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited started functioning as of 18 July 2014. It is a fully owned company of Government of India under Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and was created to develop, maintain and manage the national highways, strategic roads and other infrastructure of India. It was dedicated to the task of promoting regional connectivity in parts of the country which share international boundaries. It is responsible for the development, maintenance and management of National Highways in hilly terrain of North-East part of India, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Ladakh and Uttarakhand. It works as a specialised agency in high altitude areas and border areas. Apart from highways, NHIDCL is constructing logictic hubs and transport related infrastructure e.g. multimodal transport hubs such as bus ports, container depots, automated multilevel car parking etc.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways adopted a new systematic numbering of National Highways in April 2010. It is a systematic numbering scheme based on the orientation and the geographic location of the highway. The new system indicates the direction of National Highways whether they are east–west (odd numbers) or north–south (even numbers). It also indicates the geographical region where they are with even numbers increasing from east to west starting from NH2 and odd numbers increasing from north to south starting from NH1.

Bharatmala, a centrally-sponsored and funded road and highways project of the Government of India with a target of constructing of new highways, was started in 2018. Phase I of the Bharatmala project involves the construction of 34,800 km of highways (including the remaining projects under NHDP) at an estimated cost of by 2021–22.

==Expanding National Highway Network==
The average speed of NH construction has also seen a significant increase, from a baseline of 12.1 km/day in 2014 rising to 28.3 km/day (143%).

The speed of highway construction reached 37 km per day in 2020-21, a record for fastest highway construction in India.

Note: Yearly data for 2018 and 2020 are not available.

==Funding==
National Highways Authority of India has enough funds to increase the pace of road building. At the listing ceremony of the National Highways Infra Trust&#x27;s (NHAI InVITs) non-convertible debentures, the National Highway Infra Trust issued and listed Non-Convertible Debentures or NCDs worth Rs 1,500 crore on the Bombay Stock Exchange, with a long-dated maturity of 25 years.

NHAI collected tolls worth Rs 34,742 crore on national highways in FY22. Additionally NHAI toll revenue will to soar to Rs 1.40 lakh crores in next three years.

==Future==
Brownfield National Highway Projects is an upgrading/widening of existing four lane highways into six lane highways which are not controlled access highways.

==Trivia==

* The longest national highway is NH44, which runs between Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir and Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, covering a distance of . 
* The shortest national highway is NH766EE, which spans , from Hettikeri to Belekeri port in Karnataka.
* The Leh–Manali Highway connecting Leh in Ladakh to Manali in Himachal Pradesh is the world&#x27;s second highest-altitude motorable highway.

<doc id="824148" wikidata="Q1884503" url="?curid=824148" title="Veggie burger">
<text>A veggie burger or meatless burger is a hamburger made with a patty that does not contain meat, or the patty of such a hamburger. The patty may be made from ingredients like beans (especially soybeans and tofu), nuts, grains, seeds, or fungi such as mushrooms or mycoprotein.

The essence of the veggie burger patty has existed in various Eurasian cuisines for millennia, including in the form of grilled or fried meatless discs, or as koftas, a commonplace item in Indian cuisine. These may be made of entirely vegetarian ingredients such as legumes or other plant-derived proteins.

==Preparation==
Whilst commercial brands of veggie burger are widespread, hundreds of recipes exist for veggie burgers online and in cookbooks, aimed at the home cook and based on cereal grains, nuts, seeds, breadcrumbs, beans, textured soya protein, with starchy flours or flaxseed meal to stabilize the mix. Recipes offer a variety of flavors and textures, often containing herbs and spices and ingredients, like tamari or nutritional yeast, to increase the umami taste. Desirable characteristics include mouthfeel, a seared surface, crunch, chewiness, spiciness and resistance to crumbling. 
Like a meat burger, they can be pan fried, grilled, barbecued or oven cooked. Some are designed to be eaten in a toasted bun or brioche, with similar accompaniments to a traditional meat burger, such as tomato slices, onion rings, dill pickled cucumber, mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup. Others are stand-alone patties that are eaten with other vegetables, salad or a dipping sauce. Home produced veggie burgers can be frozen and stored, just like commercial varieties.

==Commercial brands==
Products include dried mixes to which water is added before cooking, or ready-made burgers, often found in the store chiller or freezer compartments. Some popular brands of veggie burger include the Boca Burger, the Gardenburger, Morningstar Farms, and Quorn. In the 2010s, realistic meat-like burgers were developed, led by the companies Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.

==Origin==
There have been numerous claims of invention of the veggie burger. The dish, by name, may have been created in London in 1982 by Gregory Sams, who called it the &#x27;VegeBurger&#x27;. Sams and his brother Craig had run a natural food restaurant in Paddington since the 1960s; a Carrefour hypermarket in Southampton sold 2000 packets in three weeks after its launch. An earlier reference can be heard in the 7 June 1948 episode of the American radio drama series &quot;Let George Do It&quot; called &quot;The Mister Mirch Case&quot; where a character refers to &quot;vegeburgers&quot; as a burger made of nuts and legumes.

Using the name Gardenburger, an early veggie burger was developed by Paul Wenner around 1980 or 1981 in Wenner&#x27;s vegetarian restaurant, The Gardenhouse, in Gresham, Oregon.

==Restaurants==
Some fast food companies have been offering vegetarian foods increasingly since the beginning of the 21st century.

===India===
In India where vegetarianism is widespread, McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King, Wendy&#x27;s and KFC serve veggie burgers. In 2012, McDonald&#x27;s opened its first vegetarian-only restaurant in India. A popular type of burger is the Vada pav, also known as the Bombay burger. It originated in or near the city of Mumbai and consists of a fritter (vada), cooked with potatoes mixed with green chilis and various spices, enclosed in a bread roll (pav).

===United States===
Burger King (BK) introduced a veggie burger in 2002, the first to be made available nationally in the U.S. They have also sold veggie burgers in their Australian franchise, Hungry Jack&#x27;s. In 2019, BK rolled out the Impossible Whopper as a veggie burger that realistically imitates their signature beef-based Whopper hamburger.

Veggie burgers have been sold in certain Subways and Harvey&#x27;s, as well as many chain restaurants, such as Red Robin, Chili&#x27;s, Denny&#x27;s, Friendly&#x27;s, Culvers, Johnny Rockets, and Hard Rock Cafe. Occasionally the veggie burger option will appear at the bottom of a menu as a possible substitution for beef or turkey burgers, rather than as an individual menu item.

===McDonald&#x27;s===

Different kinds of veggie burgers, including the vegetarian McVeggie, the vegan McVegan, and the McPlant, are also served permanently in McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in:
* India (McVeggie, consisting of a fried, breaded patty of ground vegetables, with lettuce and ketchup, in a wholewheat, sesame or focaccia bun)
* Bahrain
* Cheung Chau, Hong Kong (McVeggie, in Cheung Chau Bun Festival)
* Egypt (McFalafel, consisting of a falafel patty with tomato, lettuce and tahini sauce)
* Finland (McVegan)
* Germany since February 2010, McDonald&#x27;s Germany, its fourth-biggest global market, is serving veggie burgers in all its restaurants.
* Greece (McVeggie, consisting of a breaded and fried vegetable patty with tomato, iceberg lettuce and ketchup, in a sesame bun)
* Malaysia
* The Netherlands (Groentenburger=Vegetable Burger)
* Portugal (McVeggie, since November 2016)
* New Zealand (McVeggie, since December 2019)
* Sweden (McVegan)
* Switzerland (Vegi Mac)
* United Arab Emirates
* United Kingdom (McPlant)

== Manufacturing process ==
Manufacturing often follows certain steps. One commercial recipe runs as follows.

The grains and vegetables used in the patties are first washed and thoroughly cleaned to help ensure the removal of dirt, bacteria, chemical residues, and other materials that may be on the raw products. This process can either be done by hand or through the use of machinery such as high-pressure sprayers. With the use of a conveyor belt, the food is moved along under a high-pressure sprayer to remove the debris listed above. Another method that may be used by companies is the use of a hollow drum which circulates the food while water is sprayed onto it to remove the debris.
Next, a steam-heated mixer is used to cook the grain and remove any extra debris and excess water. The mixer typically has oils within it (such as safflower oil). As the oil simmers, the grains are gradually added in and the blades are used to mix the grains around. The steam created in the mixer allows the grains to cook resulting in a puree.

Next the vegetables are cut up into smaller pieces to allow more surface area for cooking purposes. This can be done by hand or through the use of machines in factories.

The vegetables are then added to the grain mixture in the steam-heated mixture. The exact ratio of grains to vegetables is unique to each company, resulting in different textures and tastes that are produced.

As the vegetables are being cooked in the mixer, their natural sugars release, resulting in caramelization. The sweet flavors thus created from this caramelization are mixed uniformly in the mixer. The technique used for the creation of this caramelization mixture is called mirepoix. This technique is very important to the production of veggie burgers, as it adds both texture and flavor to the patty.
The mirepoix mixture is then placed into another mixing tub, where dry ingredients such as oats, walnuts, potato flakes, and more are added. The mixture is then folded together to make a uniform mix. The moisture from the vegetables causes the mixture to become sticky, thus clumping together like cookie dough. This is important, as it allows the veggie burger to stick together to form the patty.

The mixture is now put into an automatic patty-making machine or press. The press then punches out the patties into a disc shape onto a conveyor belt underneath. A constant spray of water may also be used to prevent any of the mixture from sticking to machinery parts. Once on the conveyor tray, the patties move along to be put onto baking trays.

Patties are first inspected to make sure they are the correct shape, size, and texture to ensure a high-quality product. The trays are then put into a heated convection oven at a designated temperature and time.

Once out of the oven, the patties are quickly frozen with techniques such as individual quick freezing and cryogenic freezing. These quick-freezing methods freeze the patties within 30 minutes to lock in nutrients and preserve texture by the formation of a number of small ice crystals.

The frozen patties are again placed on a conveyor belt that takes them to a vacuum-packaging machine. The machine seals the patties into measured plastic sleeves and draws out any excess air. The packages are then loaded into printed cardboard boxes with the aid of another machine or done manually. The flaps on the box are then sealed closed and the product is kept in temperature-controlled storage before, during, and after delivery to grocery stores.

== Purpose of ingredients ==

=== Grains ===

Grains are primarily used in the manufacturing of veggie burgers to act as a meat substitute. The grains, such as rice and wheat, provide carbohydrates and protein components and to provide bulk to the patty. They also provide texture to the burger, which can change depending on the type of grain used. This texture and look is important as they wish to make the patty look like a beef patty.

=== Vegetables ===

Vegetables, such as corn, carrots, and mushrooms, provide texture and taste. Additionally, they provide moisture when heated. This allows the disc shape without breaking apart easily. The vegetables also provide nutrients with the addition of some vitamins and minerals.

=== Dry ingredients ===
Adding dry ingredients, such as oats, flours, nuts, or breadcrumbs, can absorb excess moisture and liquid, which results in the patty sticking together tightly. This could turn the moist veggie patties into a sticky consistency, which also helps the patties shape easily. Dry ingredients provide proteins and fiber, which add nutritional value to the veggie patty. Dry ingredients, such as walnuts and almonds, are also rich in energy, vitamins and minerals.

=== Stabilizers ===
Tapioca starch and vegetable gum are two common ingredients used as stabilizers in veggie burger. Tapioca starch is often used as a thickening agent due to its cheaper price. It gets sticky once it is wet, which helps to hold the burger patty tightly together. Vegetable gum also helps to hold everything together in the patty.

=== Oils ===
Oils, such as safflower, coconut, and olive oil, can lubricate the grain mix, and allow further cooking processing when the wheat is added. This facilitates the Maillard reaction and brings out the flavors of the veggie burger. Oils can also prevent the ingredients from sticking to the mixing machine, thus allowing them to be mixed well and heated together.

=== Salt ===
Salt is typically used for flavor, and may also be used as a preservative in veggie burgers. With the use of salt, the water activity of the food is reduced. This helps prevent the growth of micro-organisms and prolongs the shelf life of the food.

==Naming==
In October 2020, the EU rejected an amendment proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which, if passed, would have resulted in companies being forced to call veggie burgers by the term &quot;veggie discs&quot;.

<text>Pierre-Narcisse, baron Guérin (13 March 1774 – 6 July 1833) was a French painter, born in Paris.

==Biography==
A pupil of Jean-Baptiste Regnault, he carried off one of the three &quot;grands prix&quot; offered in 1796, in consequence of the competition not having taken place since 1793. In 1799, his painting &quot;The Return of Marcus Sextus&quot; (Louvre) was exhibited at the Salon and excited wild enthusiasm. Part of this was due to the subject – a victim of Sulla&#x27;s proscription returning to Rome to find his wife dead and his house in mourning – in which an allusion was found to the turmoil of the French Revolution.

Guérin on this occasion was publicly crowned by the president of the Institute, and went to Rome to study under Joseph-Benoît Suvée. In 1800, unable to remain in Rome on account of his health, he went to Naples, where he painted &quot;The Shepherds in the Tomb of Amyntas &quot;. In 1802 Guérin produced &quot;Phaedra and Hippolytus&quot; (Louvre); in 1810, after his return to Paris, he again achieved a great success with &quot;Andromache and Pyrrhus&quot; (Louvre); and in the same year also exhibited &quot;Aurora and Cephalus&quot; (Pushkin Museum) and &quot;Bonaparte and the Rebels of Cairo&quot; (Versailles). These paintings suited the popular taste of the First Empire, being highly melodramatic and pompously dignified.

The Restoration brought to Guérin fresh honours; he had received from the first consul in 1803 the cross of the Legion of Honour, and in 1815 Louis XVIII named him to the Académie des Beaux-Arts. His style changed to accord with popular taste. In &quot;Aeneas Relating to Dido the Disasters of Troy&quot; (Louvre), Guérin adopted a more sensuous, picturesque style.

Guérin was commissioned to paint for the Madeleine a scene from the history of St Louis, but his health prevented him from accomplishing what he had begun, and in 1822 he accepted the post of director of the French Academy in Rome, which in 1816 he had refused. On returning to Paris in 1828, Guérin, who had previously been made chevalier of the order of St. Michel, was ennobled. He now attempted to complete &quot;Pyrrhus and Priam&quot;, a work which he had begun at Rome, but in vain; his health had finally broken down, and in the hope of improvement he returned to Italy with Horace Vernet. Shortly after his arrival at Rome Baron Guérin died, on 6 July 1833, and was buried in the church of La Trinité de Monti by the side of Claude Lorrain.

A heroic portrait by Guerin hangs in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Baltimore. An 1821 gift of King Louis XVIII of France, it depicts the episode of the Descent from the Cross.

==Pupils==
Many artists studied with Guérin, among them Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Géricault, Ary and Hendrik Scheffer.

<text>The Red Guardian (Russian: Красный страж, Krasnyy Strazh) is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics: Aleksey Lebedev, Alexei Shostakov, [[Starlight (Marvel Comics)|Tania Belinsky]], Josef Petkus, Krassno Granitsky, Anton Ivanov, and [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Nikolai Kyrylenko]], as well as a villainous Life Model Decoy of Shostakov. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the Soviet equivalent of Captain America, although its use has continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the continuity of Ultimate Marvel, the Red Guardian is adapted as two separate characters: Captain Russia and Colonel Abdul al-Rahma.

Characters based on the Red Guardians have made scattered appearances in animated media and video games, with Anton Ivanov and Alexei Shostakov appearing in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), portrayed by Zach McGowan and David Harbour respectively.

==Fictional character biography==
===Aleksey Lebedev===
Aleksey Lebedev (Russian: Алексей Лебедев), the Golden Age version of the Red Guardian, first appeared in &quot;Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual&quot; #1 (June 1991) as a retcon of the history of the Red Guardian identity, establishing a version who appeared prior to the version first seen in 1967, created by writers Dana Moreshead and Mike Thomas, and artist Phil Hester. Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside Captain America (William Naslund) and the Sub-Mariner at the Potsdam Conference, in July 1945. He began his career during World War II, and met the All-Winners Squad (formerly the Invaders) on only one recorded occasion, clashing with them shortly after the war&#x27;s end where he taunted Captain America (secretly the Patriot) that he was &#x27;slowing down&#x27; after he was able to catch Captain America&#x27;s shield. Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America. He was later apparently killed during the purges of the 1950s, opposing the brutal experiments that would later create his successor.

===Alexei Shostakov===
Alexei Andreevich Shostakov was the first version of the Red Guardian, and was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema, first appearing in &quot;Avengers&quot; #43 (January 1967).

Alexei Shostakov was born in Moscow, and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife were agents of the Soviets: the latter as the Black Widow while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America known as the &quot;Red Guardian&quot;.

Alexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the Eastern Front, he shot down a large number of Luftwaffe fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the Soviet Air Forces win air supremacy over the skies of Stalingrad and Kursk. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the MiG-15. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the U.S. Air Force over MiG Alley during the Korean War. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalia (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova.

As the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexei Shostakov over Yuri Gagarin who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the Avengers with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and Captain America (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed &quot;something familiar&quot; about him, Shostakov revealed his identity. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when a laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.

Shostakov was later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within Bulgaria. He was responsible for a plot to capture and try his former wife for crimes as a Soviet super soldier, but his plan was foiled with the help of Daredevil and the Avengers.

Alexei resurfaces as the new Ronin and joins forces with the Dark Ocean Society to instigate a war between Japan and Russia to restore the latter&#x27;s former glory. He and the Society are defeated by Hawkeye, Mockingbird and Black Widow with the help of Fantasma, and is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

Shostakov remains in captivity in Antarctica, even after S.H.I.E.L.D. is disbanded and the prison falls under the ownership a black arms dealer. He is rescued by Yelena Belova and escapes prison.

Shostakov is approached by a cadre of several of Black Widow&#x27;s enemies, who implanted her with fake memories force her to live out a peaceful, simulated life as a married architect in San Francisco. Having already moved on from his hatred towards his ex-wife, Shostakov reluctantly joins the cadre and plans to usurp the group to rescue Natasha. When Black Widow regains her memories and the cadre decides to have her killed, Alexei saves Nat by taking a bullet meant for her.

Shostakov reunites with Belova to recover four hard drives containing records of an old military operation called Operation Snowblind. The two&#x27;s activities puts them conflict with the Winter Guard and Dracula, who owns the final hard drive. Shostakov betrays Belova to escape with the drives, but the Winter Guard are able to destroy his quarry, forcing him to leave empty handed.

Shostakov is later recruited by Bucky Barnes to be part of his new Thunderbolts team.

===Dr. Tania Belinsky===

Dr. Tania Belinsky, a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the Red Guardian identity and joined the Defenders. Created by Steve Gerber and Sal Buscema, she first appeared in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #35 (May 1976).

===Josef Petkus===
Josef Petkus is the fourth version of the Red Guardian, first appearing in &quot;Captain America&quot; #352 (April 1989), and was created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Kieron Dwyer. The character subsequently appears in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #319–324 (July–October 1990), &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #393 (May 1992), and &quot;Soviet Super-Soldiers&quot; #1 (November 1992). The character subsequently appears as the Steel Guardian in &quot;Iron Man&quot; (vol. 2) #9 (October 1998). Petkus appeared as part of the &quot;Supreme Soviets&quot; entry in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update &#x27;89&quot; #7.

Josef Petkus was a special operative for the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, and appeared as a member of the militant Supreme Soviets. Alongside the Supreme Soviets, he attacked the Soviet Super-Soldiers for defecting from the Soviet Union. Alongside Captain America, he later battled a bear-like creature composed of the Darkforce. The Supreme Soviets were later renamed the post-Soviet Russian super-team called the Winter Guard. Alongside this confederacy, he teamed with the Avengers and Alpha Flight to battle the Peace Corpse, the Atlantean Army, and the Combine. Petkus later joined a Winter Guard splinter group called the People&#x27;s Protectorate, now calling himself the &quot;Steel Guardian&quot;. He and his team went off in search of the timelord Immortus, hoping to find a way to resurrect Vanguard&#x27;s sister Lanyia. They agreed to fight off Dire Wraiths invading Immortus&#x27; realm in exchange for this favor; Josef being killed while in the line of duty.

===Krassno Granitsky===
Krassno Granitsky, a fifth version of the Red Guardian, appeared in &quot;Maverick&quot; #10 (June 1998), and was created by writer Jorge Gonzales and artist Leo Fernandez. The name &quot;Krassno Granitsky&quot; comes from the James Bond novel &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;; it is the Russianized name of the assassin Donovan &quot;Red&quot; Grant. He teamed up with the mercenary superhero Maverick to battle a crime lord. He also appeared in the first issue of Ed Brubaker&#x27;s &quot;Captain America&quot;, where he was executed by Aleksander Lukin.

===Anton===
Anton, the sixth version of the Red Guardian, made his first appearance in the first issue of Jeph Loeb&#x27;s &quot;Hulk&quot; series (co-created with Ed McGuinness) as a member of the Winter Guard. Anton claims to be an engineer and a former pilot of the Crimson Dynamo armor, and was later revealed to be (at least partially) a Life Model Decoy (LMD). He was decapitated by a Dire Wraith, although his head was kept in storage, seemingly still alive, and in control of other LMDs.

===Nikolai Kyrylenko===

Nikolai Kyrylenko (also known as Vanguard) is the seventh version of the Red Guardian, and leads the Winter Guard. Created by Bill Mantlo and Carmine Infantino for &quot;Iron Man&quot; #109 (April 1978), he was redeveloped as the Red Guardian by David Gallaher and Steve Ellis from &quot;Darkstar and the Winter Guard&quot; #2 (July 2010) onward.

==Powers and abilities==
None of the Red Guardian&#x27;s various identity users have been revealed to possess superhuman powers or abilities, with the exception of Tania Belinsky after her mutation by the Presence, Ultimate Marvel versions, Krylenko, the seventh Red Guardian, and adaptations of the character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). All are highly skilled athletes. Shostakov was an expert pilot, a master hand-to-hand combatant, and was trained in espionage techniques by the KGB. All of the Guardians but Tania have used a steel shield similar to that used by Captain America. Alexei and Tania used a &quot;belt-buckle&quot; disc, a hurling weapon which magnetically returned to the wearer&#x27;s hand when thrown, and was a part of their costume&#x27;s belt buckle. The fourth Red Guardian, Josef Petkus, often employed an energized sword as a secondary weapon alongside his shield. The sixth Red Guardian was an LMD named Anton Ivanov, whose powers are cybernetic based. His falsified backstory was that he was an expert engineer and former Crimson Dynamo pilot; his real strength lies in his moderate degree of enhanced cybernetic physicality. The latest Red Guardian is Nikolai Krylenko/Vanguard, brother to Laynia Petrovna, whose powers are derived from his mutation. which stems to a fullbody force field that repels electromagnetic and kinetic energy, forces he can best guide and direct through a medium like the technically advanced vibranium shield supplied to him by the Executive Security Committee. or through a crux like the former symbol of his home country, a hammer and sickle. He also directs this force against the earth itself to obtain flight. Nikolai wears a more advanced suit than previous Red Guardians, which is lined with circuitry that works in conjunction with the compact computer on his shield, not only enabling the guided flight and return through their digital connection, but the amplification of the effects of his own energy field.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Exiles&quot;===
In one of the &quot;Exiles&quot; realities, a Red Guardian in full body armor on Earth-3470 appears.

===&quot;Civil War: House of M&quot;===
In &quot;Civil War: House of M&quot;, the Red Guardian was seen as a member of the Soviet Super Soldiers.

===Ultimate Marvel===
====Captain Russia====
The Ultimate Marvel version of Alexei Shostakov is a Russian super soldier codenamed &quot;Captain Russia&quot;. Meant to be the Russian counterpart of Captain America, this version is certifiably insane and uses a makeshift shield created partially from human remains, and possesses superhuman strength and durability. A fight between the two results in Captain America defeating him, by stabbing him with splintered wood that acts as a stake through the chest, declaring &quot;Fighting is about winning.&quot; Shostakov was once married to Black Widow and is now deceased.

====Colonel Abdul al-Rahma====

Colonel Abdul al-Rahman from Azerbaijan (leader of the Liberators) was also based on the Red Guardian. A parallel to Captain America, he was transformed into a super-soldier by Russian scientists, sporting a predominantly red costume and wielding a lightsaber-like weapon. He battles Captain America in front of the White House but is defeated when the Hulk throws the shield to sever his hands and Rogers kills him with his own weapon. Shocked at learning Abdul was a teenager who wanted to free his country from American occupation, Rogers looks on as his body is later taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===

Characters based on the Red Guardian appear in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU):
* Anton Ivanov appears in the fourth and fifth seasons of the live-action television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (2016–2018), portrayed by Zach McGowan. This version is a reclusive Russian industrialist known as &quot;The Superior&quot; who believes Inhumans to be monsters. He works with the Watchdogs, Senator Ellen Nadeer, and Holden Radcliffe to fight S.H.I.E.L.D. until he is crippled by Daisy Johnson. Following this, Ivanov is decapitated by AIDA, who keeps him alive as a brain in a vat and gives him a series of Life-Model Decoys Designed Only for Killing (L-MODOKs) for his mind to remotely control. After finding Ivanov&#x27;s head, high-ranking Hydra member General Hale persuades him to join her before S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Elena &quot;Yo-Yo&quot; Rodriguez defeats him. Showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell introduced Ivanov with the intention of turning him into MODOK, before Marvel Studios retracted access to the latter for use in the &quot;New Warriors&quot; pilot (2018) and the film &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023).
* The Alexei Shostakov incarnation of the Red Guardian appears in the live-action film &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021), portrayed by David Harbour. This version is the Russian super-soldier counterpart to Captain America and a father-figure to Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova. Harbour said Shostakov has &quot;tons of cracks all over him. And he&#x27;s not the heroic, noble man that [people] want him to be. He both comically and tragically has a lot of flaws&quot;. For Harbour&#x27;s portrayal, he and &quot;Black Widow&quot; director Cate Shortland discussed Ricky Gervais&#x27; performance in &quot;The Office&quot; and Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s in &quot;The Savages&quot; (2007), &quot;comedy that comes out of real domestic need&quot;.
** In &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021), years prior to the film&#x27;s main events, Shostakov allies with General Dreykov of the Red Room, who sends him on an undercover mission to the United States alongside Melina Vostokoff, Romanoff, and Belova. After concluding the mission however, Dreykov has Shostakov incarcerated in the Seventh Circle Prison. In the present, Romanoff and Belova free Shostakov to help them and Vostokoff destroy the Red Room.
** Alternate timeline variants of Shostakov appear in the third season of the animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;.
** Harbour will reprise his role as Shostakov in the upcoming live-action film &quot;Thunderbolts*&quot; (2025), as a member of the titular team alongside Belova.
** A separate variant of Shostakov will appear in the upcoming animated series &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;.

<text>Arts and architecture in India have been shaped by a synthesis of indigenous and foreign influences that have consequently shaped the course of the arts of the rest of Asia, since ancient times. Arts refer to paintings, architecture, literature, music, dance, languages and cinema. In early India, most of the arts were derived Vedic influences. After the birth of contemporary Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. The coming of Islam spawned a whole new era of Indian architecture and art. Finally the British brought their own Gothic and Roman influences and fused it with the Indian style. They have a culture infusion in their art.

==Architecture==

The earliest production in the Indus Valley Civilization was characterised by cities and houses where religion did not seem to play an active role. The Buddhist period is primarily represented by three important building types- the Chaitya Hall (place of worship), the Vihara (monastery) and the Stupa (hemispherical mound for worship/ memory) - exemplified by the caves of Ajanta and Ellora and the monumental Sanchi Stupa. The Jaina temples are characterised by high levels of detail that can be seen in the Dilwara Temples in Mount Abu. Early beginnings of Hindu temple architecture have been traced to the remains at Aihole and Pattadakal in present-day Karnataka, and have Vedic altars and late Vedic temples as described by Pāṇini as models. Later, as more differentiation took place, the Dravidian/ Southern style and or the Indo-Aryan/ Northern/ Nagara style of temple architecture emerged as dominant modes, epitomized in productions such as the Brihadeeswara Temple, Thanjavur, and the Sun Temple, Konark.

With the arrival of Islam, a new style of architecture known as Indo-Islamic architecture emerged combining traditional Indian and Islamic elements. The earliest examples include the Qutb complex, a series of monuments built by successive sultans of the Delhi Sultanate. The architecture of the Mughal Empire includes the Red Fort, Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Humayun&#x27;s tomb, Jama Masjid and Fatehpur Sikri.

With colonization, a new chapter began. Though the Dutch, Portuguese and the French were influencers, it was the English who had a lasting impact. The architecture of the colonial period varied from the beginning attempts at creating authority through classical prototypes to the later approach of producing a supposedly more responsive image through what is now termed Indo-Saracenic architecture- a mixture of Hindu, Islamic and Western elements.

With the introduction of Modern Architecture into India and later with Independence, the quest was more towards progress as a paradigm fuelled by Nehruvian visions. The planning of Chandigarh- a city most architects hate/love- by Le Corbusier was considered a step towards this. Later as modernism became less popular in the West and new directions were sought for, there was a movement in India toward architecture rooted in the Indian context. This direction called Critical Regionalism is exemplified in the works of architects such as B. V. Doshi, Charles Correa, etc. Apart from this, the advent of globalisation and economic development since the 90s, has spawned a collection of modern IT campuses and skyscrapers, and as economic reform accelerates, metropolitan areas are gaining futuristic skylines.

;Various examples of Indian architecture
==Literature==
Indian literature is generally acknowledged, but not wholly established, as the oldest in the world. India has 22 officially recognized languages, and a huge variety of literature has been produced in these languages over the years. In Indian literature, oral and written forms are both important. Hindu literary traditions dominate a large part of Indian culture. Apart from the Vedas which are a sacred form of knowledge, there are other works such as the Hindu epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, treatises such as Vaastu Shastra in architecture and town planning, and Arthashastra in political science. Devotional Hindu drama, poetry and songs span the subcontinent. Among the best known are the works of Kalidasa (writer of the famed Sanskrit play Shakuntala) and Tulsidas (who wrote an epic Hindi poem based on the Ramayana, called Raamcharitmaanas).

Tamil literature has been in existence for more than 2500 years. Tolkaappiyam has been credited as its oldest work, whereas the exact origins of Thirukkural is unknown. The golden age of Tamil literature was during the Sangam period, roughly 1800 years ago. The classic works of this period are Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai, and Sivakasinthamani. Tamil literature is known for its secular traditions, although its authors had strong religious beliefs. Thirukkural is considered to be the greatest of Tamil works. Kannada literature is probably the third oldest in Indian literature next to Sanskrit literature and Tamil literature. The earliest reported work in Kannada literature dates back to the fifth century. The first available literary in Kannada is Kavirajamarga, written in the eighth century by Amoghavarsha Nrpatunga. Hindi literature started as religious and philosophical poetry in medieval periods in dialects like Avadhi and Brij. The most famous figures from this period are Kabir and Tulsidas. In modern times, the &quot;Khadi&quot; dialect became more prominent and a variety of literature was produced in Sanskrit.

The most renowned Bengali writer is Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature. In the last century, several Indian writers have distinguished themselves not only in traditional Indian languages but also in English. India&#x27;s only native-born Nobel laureate in literature was the Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore, but VS Naipaul, a diaspora Indian novelist born in Trinidad, also won the Nobel in 2001. Other major writers who are either Indian or of Indian origin and derive much inspiration from Indian themes are R. K. Narayan, Vikram Seth, Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, Raja Rao, Amitav Ghosh, Vikram Chandra, Mukul Kesavan, Shashi Tharoor, Nayantara Sehgal, Anita Desai, Ashok Banker, Shashi Deshpande, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Bharati Mukherjee.

==Music==

Indian music includes multiple varieties of folk, popular, pop, and classical music. India&#x27;s classical music tradition, including Carnatic and Hindustani music, has a history spanning millennia and, developed over several eras, remains fundamental to the lives of Indians today as sources of religious inspiration, cultural expression and pure entertainment. India is made up of several dozen ethnic groups, speaking their own languages and dialects. Alongside distinctly subcontinental forms there are major influences from Persian, Arab and British music. Indian genres like filmi and bhangra have become popular throughout the United Kingdom, South and East Asia, and around the world.

Indian stars now sell records in many countries, while world music fans listen to the roots music of India&#x27;s diverse nations. American soul, rock and hip hop music have also made a large impact, primarily on Indian pop and filmi music. Other highly popular forms are ghazal, qawwali, thumri, dhrupad, dadra, bhajan, kirtan, shabad, and gurbani.

Filmi music is often said to have begun in 1931, with the release of Ardeshir M. Irani&#x27;s Alam Ara and its popular soundtrack. In the earliest years of the Indian cinema, filming was generally Indian (classical and folk) in inspiration, with some Western elements. Over the years, the Western elements have increased, but without completely destroying the Indian flavour. Most of the Indian movies are musicals and feature elaborate song and dance numbers. There is constant work for pop music composers — or music directors, to use the Indian term. Movie soundtracks are released as tapes and CDs, sometimes even before the movie is released.

==Dance==

Indian classical dance is performed in different styles. Its theory can be traced back to the Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni, a sage from Tamil Nadu (400 BC). The Natya Shastra is the most important ancient treatise on classical Indian dance. It is also called the fifth Veda in reference to the foundation of Hindu religion and philosophy, from which sprang the related South Indian musical tradition of Carnatic music. Its various current forms include Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Manipuri, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Mohiniaattam, Kathak and Sattriya.

Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form originating in Tamil Nadu. It is thought to have been created by Bharata Muni. In ancient times Bharatanatyam was performed by mandir (Hindu temple) Devadasis. Many of the ancient sculptures in Hindu temples are based on Bharatanatyam dance postures karanas.

Odissi is one of the oldest surviving forms of dance, with depictions of Odissi dancing dating back as far as the 1st century BC. Like other forms of Indian classical dance, the Odissi style traces its origins back to antiquity. Dancers are found depicted in bas-relief in the hills of Udaygiri (near Bhubaneswar) dating back to the 1st century BC. The Natya Shastra speaks of the dance from this region and refers to it as Odra-Magadhi.

Kathakali (&quot;katha&quot; for story, &quot;kali&quot; for performance or play) is a form of dance-drama. It originated in the South Indian state of Kerala over 500 years ago. It is a spectacular combination of drama, dance, music and ritual. Characters with vividly painted faces and elaborate costumes re-enact stories from the Hindu epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana.

Kuchipudi is a classical dance form from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, a state of South India. Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of Krishna district that borders the Bay of Bengal and with resident Brahmins practising this traditional dance form, it acquired the present name.
Mohiniaattam is a traditional dance from the South Indian state of Kerala. Mohini is an Apsaras in the Hindu mythology and aattam in Malayalam means dance. So Mohiniaattam essentially means &quot;dance of the enchantress&quot;. The theme of Mohiniaattam is love and devotion to god. The costume worn by the dancers are typically white coloured kasavu saree with golden borders.

The Kathak dance form arose from the Vaishnava devotees dancing to the episodes from Krishna&#x27;s life. Originally a Northern Indian temple dance, it was transformed to a court dance in the Mughal era. The new Muslim influence brought with it certain changes to the dance form: what had been a largely devotional practice now became more a courtly entertainment.

The Sattriya dance is believed to be a creation of the great Vaishnavite (bhakti) guru Srimanta Sankardeva considered the lead architect of Assamese literature and culture. He created this magnificent Sattriya dance to accompany the &quot;Ankiya Naat&quot; (a form of Assamese one-act play, another creation of Sankardeva) which was usually performed in &quot;Satras&quot; (Assamese monasteries). Since the dance developed and grew within the &quot;Satras&quot;, it is named after these religious institutions.

Folk dances are performed for every possible occasion, to celebrate the arrival of seasons, birth of a child, a wedding and festivals. The dances are very focused on gestures, postures, and expressions. The dances burst with verve and vitality. Men and women perform some dances exclusively, while in some performances men and women dance together. On most occasions artists sing the main lyrics and are accompanied by instruments. Each form of dance has a specific costume. Most costumes are flamboyant with extensive jewels.

Bhangra is a form of music and dance that originated in the Punjab region of India. Bhangra dance began as a folk dance conducted by Punjabi farmers to celebrate the coming of Vaisakhi, a sikh festival. The specific moves reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This musical art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The dance started from just one move and evolved later on. It has been popularized by Punjabi artists from the Sikh communities, with which it is now commonly associated.[1] Today, Bhangra dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe – including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and even talent shows.

Thirayattam is a ritual performing dance of south malabar region (kozhikode and malappuram Dt:) in Kerala state. In Malayalam language, the word &quot;Thirayattam&quot; refers to a &#x27;colourful dance&#x27;. This vibrant Ethnic art form blend of dance, instrumental music, drama, facial and body makeup, martial art and ritualistic Function. Thirayattam enacted in courtyards of sacred groves and village shrines, during Thirayattam festival.

== Drama ==
Indian drama and theatre has a long history alongside its music and dance. Kalidasa&#x27;s plays like Shakuntala and Meghadoota are some of the older dramas, following those of Bhasa. Kutiyattam of Kerala, is the only surviving specimen of the ancient Sanskrit theatre, thought to have originated around the beginning of the Common Era, and is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It strictly follows the Natya Shastra. Nātyāchārya Māni Mādhava Chākyār is credited for reviving the age old drama tradition from extinction. He was known for mastery of Rasa Abhinaya. He started to perform the Kalidasa plays like &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntala&quot;, &quot;Vikramorvaśīya&quot; and &quot;Mālavikāgnimitra&quot;; Bhasa&#x27;s &quot;Swapnavāsavadatta&quot; and &quot;Pancharātra&quot;; Harsha&#x27;s &quot;Nagananda&quot;.

==Shadow play==
Shadow puppets are an ancient part of India&#x27;s culture and art, particularly regionally as the &quot;keelu bomme&quot; and &quot;Tholu bommalata&quot; of Andhra Pradesh, the &quot;Togalu gombeyaata&quot; in Karnataka, the &quot;charma bahuli natya&quot; in Maharashtra, the &quot;Ravana chhaya&quot; in Odisha, the &quot;Tholpavakoothu&quot; in Kerala and the &quot;thol bommalatta&quot; in Tamil Nadu. Shadow puppet play is also found in pictorial traditions in India, such as temple mural painting, loose-leaf folio paintings, and the narrative paintings. Dance forms such as the Chhau of Odisha literally mean &quot;shadow&quot;. The shadow theatre dance drama theatre are usually performed on platform stages attached to Hindu temples, and in some regions these are called &quot;Koothu Madams&quot; or &quot;Koothambalams&quot;. In many regions, the puppet drama play is performed by itinerant artist families on temporary stages during major temple festivals. Legends from the Hindu epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; dominate their repertoire. However, the details and the stories vary regionally.

During the 19th century and early parts of the 20th century of the colonial era, Indologists believed that shadow puppet plays had become extinct in India, though mentioned in its ancient Sanskrit texts. In the 1930s and thereafter, states Stuart Blackburn, these fears of its extinction were found to be false as evidence emerged that shadow puppetry had remained a vigorous rural tradition in central Kerala mountains, most of Karnataka, northern Andhra Pradesh, parts of Tamil Nadu, Odisha and southern Maharashtra. The Marathi people, particularly of low caste, had preserved and vigorously performed the legends of Hindu epics as a folk tradition. The importance of Marathi artists is evidenced, states Blackburn, from the puppeteers speaking Marathi as their mother tongue in many non-Marathi speaking states of India.
According to Beth Osnes, the &quot;tholu bommalata&quot; shadow puppet theatre dates back to the 3rd century BCE, and has attracted patronage ever since. The puppets used in a &quot;tholu bommalata&quot; performance, states Phyllis Dircks, are &quot;translucent, lusciously multicolored leather figures four to five feet tall, and feature one or two articulated arms&quot;. The process of making the puppets is an elaborate ritual, where the artist families in India pray, go into seclusion, produce the required art work, then celebrate the &quot;metaphorical birth of a puppet&quot; with flowers and incense.

The &quot;tholu pava koothu&quot; of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on a backlit screen. The shadows are used to creatively express characters and stories in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. A complete performance of the epic can take forty-one nights, while an abridged performance lasts as few as seven days. One feature of the &quot;tholu pava koothu&quot; show is that it is a team performance of puppeteers, while other shadow plays such as the &quot;wayang&quot; of Indonesia are performed by a single puppeteer for the same &quot;Ramayana&quot; story. There are regional differences within India in the puppet arts. For example, women play a major role in shadow play theatre in most parts of India, except in Kerala and Maharashtra. Almost everywhere, except Odisha, the puppets are made from tanned deer skin, painted and articulated. Translucent leather puppets are typical in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, while opaque puppets are typical in Kerala and Odisha. The artist troupes typically carry over a hundred puppets for their performance in rural India.

== Sculpture ==

First sculptures in India date back to the Indus Valley Civilization, where stone and bronze carvings have been discovered. This is one of the earliest instances of sculpture in the world. Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unrivalled temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at Ellora were not actually constructed using blocks, but instead carved out of solid rock, making them perhaps the largest and most intricate sculptures in the world.

During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in what is now southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha&#x27;s life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.

The pink sandstone sculptures of Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art that the world is now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

== Painting ==

The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of pre-historic times, the petroglyphs as found in places like Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of Ellora, Maharashtra state present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of Ajanta and Ellora caves appeared. India&#x27;s Buddhist literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.

Indian Art was given a new lease of life by the British in early 19th century when the new government required painters to document Indian life and times. The English School paintings, as these new art were called had seen the emergence of India&#x27;s greatest artists of all times Raja Ravi Verma. Other important artists of the Colonial period include Jamini Roy, Amrita Sher-Gil, Ramkinkar Baij and Rabindranath Tagore. After independence, Indian art became more diverse and artists like M. F. Husain, F. N. Souza, Subodh Gupta, Devajyoti Ray, Sudip Roy, Paresh Maity and Bose Krishnamachari earned international recognition.

;Indian art, ancient and medieval
==Cinema==

India is a major regional center for cinema. The Indian film industry is the second largest in the world (1200 movies released in the year 2002). Each of the larger jrods supports its own film industry: Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Odia. The Hindi/Urdu film industry, based in Mumbai, formerly &quot;Bombay&quot;, is called Bollywood (a melding of Hollywood and Bombay). Similar neologisms have been coined for the Kannada (Karnataka State) film industry (Sandalwood) based on Karnataka being known for Sandalwood, Tamil film industry (Kollywood, from the Kodambakkam district of Chennai) and the Telugu film industry (Tollywood). Tollygunge is a metonym for the Bengali film industry, long centered in the Tollygunge district of Kolkata. The Bengali language industry is notable as including the director Satyajit Ray, an international filmmaker and a winner of many awards, among them the Bharat Ratna (India&#x27;s highest civilian award), the Légion d&#x27;honneur (France), and the Lifetime achievement Academy Award. Odia film industry is known as Ollywood and it has a history of film making since 1936. The Bollywood industry is usually the largest in terms of films produced and box office receipts, just as Urdu/Hindi speakers outnumber speakers of other Indian languages within India.

== Radio ==

Radio broadcasting was, until recently a government monopoly under the Directorate General of All India Radio—established in 1936 and since 1957 also known as Akashvani—a government-owned, semicommercial operation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. From only six stations at the time of independence, All India Radio&#x27;s network had expanded by the mid-1990s to 146 AM stations plus a National Channel, the Integrated North-East Service (aimed at tribal groups in northeast India), and the External Service. There are five regional headquarters for All India Radio: the North Zone in New Delhi; the North-East Zone in Guwahati, Assam; the East Zone in Calcutta; the West Zone in Bombay; and the South Zone in Madras. All India Radio covers 99.37% of India&#x27;s populace.

The government-owned network provides both national and local programs in Hindi, English, and sixteen regional languages. Commercial services, which were inaugurated in 1957, are provided by Vividh Bharati Service, headquartered in Mumbai. Vividh Bharati, which accepts advertisements, broadcasts from thirty-one AM and FM stations in the mid-1990s.

India has an extensive network of medium wave and shortwave stations. In 1994 there were eighty-five FM stations and seventy-three shortwave stations that covered the entire country. The broadcasting equipment is mostly Indian made and reaches special audiences, such as farmers needing agroclimatic, plant protection, and other agriculture-related information. The number of radio receivers increased almost fivefold between 1970 and 1994, from around 14 million to nearly 65 million. Most radios are also produced within India.

The foreign broadcast service is a function of the External Services Division of All India Radio. In 1994 seventy hours of news, features, and entertainment programs were broadcast daily in twenty-five languages using thirty-two shortwave transmitters. The principal target audiences are listeners in neighbouring countries and the large overseas Indian community.

Satellite Radio was introduced to the Indian market in 2000 by WorldSpace, a Washington DC–based company. Currently WorldSpace beams 30 channels comprising music, news, and regional channels, a subscriber in India pays 1,200 per annum. In addition, some premium channels are available at an extra cost. This service requires special receivers which are often subsidized by world space.

Recently The Department of Space (DoS) indicated it is exploring the possibility of setting up a multi-media satellite platform that would include satellite radio, video and data channels.

== Television ==

Television service is available throughout the country. Doordarshan is a government-owned broadcaster established in 1959 and a part of All India Radio until 1976. It operates of one national network and seven regional networks. In 1992 there were sixty-three high-power television transmitters, 369 medium-power transmitters, seventy-six low-power transmitters, and twenty-three transposers. Regular satellite transmissions began in 1982 (the same year colour transmission began).
By 1994 some six million people were receiving television broadcasts via satellite, and the number was expected to increase rapidly throughout the rest of the decade. Cable television was even more prolific, with an estimated 12 to 15 million subscribers in 1994. Besides Doordarshan, Zee TV—an independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992—uses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, Zee TV and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are Cable News Network (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong–based Star TV (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the Hindustan Times in New Delhi (1994); and Sun TV, a Tamil language service in Chennai (1994). In a communications breakthrough in July 1995, Doordarshan agreed, for a US$1.5 million annual fee and 50 percent of advertising revenue when it exceeds US$1.5 million, to allow CNN to broadcast twenty-four hours a day via an Indian satellite. regional, and local service. The number of television sets increased from around 500,000 in 1976 to 9 million in early 1987 and to around 47 million in 1994; increases are expected to continue at around six million sets per year. More than 75 percent of television sets were black and white models in 1992, but the proportion of colour sets is increasing annually. Most television sets are produced in India.

<text>Vebjørn Rodal (born 16 September 1972) is a retired Norwegian middle distance athlete, who won the gold medal in the 800 m at the 1996 Summer Olympics with the time 1:42.58.

==Biography==
Rodal, born and raised in Berkåk in Rennebu Municipality, made his international senior debut in 1992, at the Barcelona Olympics, reaching the semi-finals in his event, the 800 m. Part of a group of successful Norwegian athletes, he won his first international medal only two years later, placing second at the 1994 European Championships .

By finishing third in the final of the 1995 World Championships, he established himself as one of the top 800 m runners in the world, and was among the medal contenders for the 1996 Summer Olympics, held in Atlanta. Not present at the Olympics was world champion Wilson Kipketer, who had emigrated from Kenya to Denmark, but wasn&#x27;t allowed to run for his new country by the Kenyans. This made the final wide open. Rodal made the final, which was run in a blistering pace. Rodal overtook most of the field in his second lap, and took the lead at the last bend, crossing the line first in a new Olympic record of 1:42.58, which stood until the 2012 Summer Olympics. With four runners under 1:43, the final was one of the fastest 800 m ever run.

The Olympic title would remain Rodal&#x27;s only international victory. He failed to make the final of the Sydney Olympics in 2000, finishing seventh in his semi-final. He more or less retired afterwards, although he has entered national competitions on occasion.

<doc id="824245" wikidata="Q3058032" url="?curid=824245" title="Esek Hopkins">
<text>Commodore Esek Hopkins (April 26, 1718February 26, 1802) was a Continental Navy officer and privateer. He served as the only commander-in-chief of the Continental navy during the American Revolutionary War, when the Continental Congress appointed him to the position in December 1775. Hopkins is known for carrying out the successful raid of Nassau in the Bahamas, which captured large amounts of military supplies. His legacy today has become controversial for due to Hopkins&#x27; involvement in the Atlantic slave trade.

==Early life and career==
Esek Hopkins was born in Scituate, in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, into one of the most prominent families of what is today&#x27;s Rhode Island. At the age of twenty he went to sea and rapidly came to the fore as a good sailor and skillful trader. Before the Revolutionary War he had sailed to nearly every quarter of the Earth, and commanded a privateer in the French and Indian War. In the interval between voyages, he was engaged in Rhode Island politics, served as a deputy to the Rhode Island General Assembly, and rendered efficient support to his brother Stephen, who became governor in 1755. In September 1764, during his time as a privateer and merchant, Hopkins took command of the slave ship &quot;Sally&quot;, owned by Nicholas Brown and Company. Hopkins had no prior experience in operating a slave-trading vessel at the time, and the 15-month voyage would result in the death of 109 out of 196 slaves. In late 1765, &quot;Sally&quot; arrived at its first trading destination in the West Indies, but the surviving African captives were in such poor health that most sold for very little. Hopkins&#x27; disastrous command of &quot;Sally&quot; contributed to Moses Brown&#x27;s turn against participation in the Atlantic slave trade.

==Revolutionary War service==


Hopkins was appointed a brigadier general to command all military forces of Rhode Island on October 4, 1775. He immediately began to strengthen Rhode Island&#x27;s defenses with the help of his deputy, William West. A few months later, December 22, 1775, Hopkins was appointed Commander in Chief of the Continental Navy authorized by the Continental Congress to protect American commerce. On January 5, 1776, Congress gave Hopkins his orders: 
Hopkins took command of eight small merchant ships that had been altered as men-of-war at Philadelphia. After much deliberation about taking on the overwhelming British forces listed in his orders, Hopkins utilized the last portion of his orders. He sailed south on February 17, 1776, for the first U.S. fleet operation that took the fleet to Providence in the Bahamas. He felt that it would be much more advantageous to seize a prize for the Continental Army than take a chance of destroying the Continental Navy in its infancy. He knew that the British port in Nassau would be poorly guarded and had friends there who would help his cause.

The Raid of Nassau, an assault on the British colony there March 3, 1776 was also the first U.S. amphibious landing. Marines and sailors landed in &quot;a bold stroke, worthy of an older and better trained service,&quot; capturing munitions desperately needed in the War of Independence. The little fleet returned to New London on April 8, 1776, having also made prizes of two British merchantmen and a six-gun schooner, while failing to capture but severely damaging on April 6.

John Hancock, President of the Continental Congress, wrote Hopkins: &quot;I beg leave to congratulate you on the success of your Expedition. Your account of the spirit and bravery shown by the men affords them [Congress] the greatest satisfaction...&quot; Not only did Hopkins&#x27; expedition get needed war supplies for the Continental Army, but it showed the British Navy that they would have to divert their ships from the belligerent colonies to protect non-belligerent areas, thereby leaving fewer British ships to fight on the war front. John Paul Jones was a lieutenant at this time under Hopkins.

Hopkins&#x27; decision to go to Nassau rather than pursue another part of his orders concerning Chesapeake Bay of Virginia and North and South Carolina, upset southern members of the Continental Congress, which added to the political, social, economic, religious, and philosophical differences already occurring between members of the Congress.

What happened next in the ensuing months was politically complex and controversial. The Continental Congress and individual state governors through their legislatures allowed privately owned ships to help in the battle against Britain by issuing letters of marque. There were virtually thousands of these ships, which overtook British ships, contributing to the war effort at sea. These privateer ships were allowed to claim any items found on the British ships they conquered as their own. They therefore were able to pay their seamen and officers nearly twice the amount that the Continental Navy could pay their crews, since the items captured by Continental ships went for the good of the colonies. Even after the Congress built and outfitted several more ships for Commodore Hopkins to use, he could not find adequate personnel to man the ships. John Adams, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Treat Paine, and John Paul Jones came to the defense of Hopkins.

Nevertheless, on August 12, 1776, Congress censured Hopkins. Humiliation and an injured reputation followed. Many sources say it would have been better if Hopkins was relieved of his command after the censure, rather than resume his command with a disgraced reputation and a loss of respect from his officers. Yet shortly after this John Hancock, President of the Continental Congress, wrote a resolution to have a schooner remade into a war ship and named the Hopkins, although there are no records that indicate his resolution was fulfilled.

Hopkins&#x27; little fleet was mostly blockaded in Narragansett Bay by the superior British sea power for the rest of Hopkins&#x27; tenure as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy, partly due to the fact that he had inadequate manpower to confront the enemy. A group of Hopkins&#x27; officers finally went directly to the Congress while at the same time leaving their ships without permission. Later it was determined that the allegations the officers took to Congress could not be substantiated— not in time, however, to squelch what was to happen. Pressure on the nature of Hopkins&#x27; character and ability became increasingly significant. Even though John Hancock had congratulated Hopkins at the time, Hopkins&#x27; decision to go to Nassau in the Bahamas and the escape of &quot;Glasgow&quot; was used by politically charged legislators against him.

Even with the impassioned defense of John Adams, the Continental Congress voted on 2 January 1778 to relieve Hopkins of his command permanently. Nevertheless, the first action of Hopkins, in Nassau, which proved later to be an effective method for the Continental Navy to use against an overwhelming British Navy, was politically used against him. Substantiating this, John Paul Jones, who had been a lieutenant directly under Hopkins, gained great respect while continuing this same type of naval warfare against the much larger Royal Navy. &quot;Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, the Raid on Nassau brought the war to the English in an area where they felt more strategically threatened than the American Colonies. The West Indies was a location of importance to the British both due to trade concerns and due to its pivotal role in naval conflicts with the English nemesis France. Paranoia over losing the West Indies would frequently deflect English interests and military assets away from the war in America. English preoccupation with this area would nearly cause her to abandon the war in 1778 and may well have cost her the war in the long run. If true, it might well be said that this raid was the first tweaking of this English concern and a tweaking which may have set the tone for those later English decisions. As such, the Raid of Nassau was not just a minor tactical victory but a great strategic victory as well.&quot;

Hopkins&#x27;s commission was terminated by the Congress on January 2, 1778, for a variety of reasons, perhaps including for his part in the arrest of Richard Marven and Samuel Shaw, a pair of early whistle-blowers, due to their having reported his torture of British prisoners of war. Hopkins&#x27;s subsequent institution of criminal libel proceedings against Marven and Shaw is single-handedly responsible for the resolution of Congress &quot;That it is the duty of all persons in the service of the United States, as well as all other inhabitants thereof to give the earliest information to Congress or any other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or other misdemeanours committed by any persons in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge.&quot;

==Post-Revolution==
In spite of his Congressional dismissal, Hopkins was highly respected in Rhode Island and continued to serve the Rhode Island General Assembly through 1786, then retired to his farm where he died February 26, 1802. His home, the Esek Hopkins House, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Legacy==
Three United States Navy vessels have been named in his honor, two destroyers and a patrol boat.

A statue of Hopkins by Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson was dedicated in 1891 on the site of the former Hopkins family cemetery at Charles and Branch Street.

In June 2020, the Providence School Board voted to remove Hopkins&#x27; name from Esek Hopkins Middle School, citing Hopkins&#x27; association with the slave ship &quot;Sally.&quot;

Hopkins adopted, and helped to popularize, the &quot;Gadsden flag&quot; that depicts a Timber rattlesnake with 13 rattles representing the 13 Colonies with the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; on a Yellow background. He adopted the banner as his personal flag and flew it from the mainmast of his flagship USS Alfred while he was aboard.

==Personal life==
Hopkins married Desire Burroughs (1724–1794) in November 1741. She belonged to a prosperous family of Newport, thus increasing his influence in Rhode Island. The marriage produced 9 children, including John Burroughs Hopkins (1742–1796), a participant in the Gaspee Affair, who later became a captain in the Continental Navy; and Susannah Hopkins (1756–1850), who married Jonathan Maxcy, a Baptist minister and second president of the formerly Baptist-affiliated Brown University, which was then known as the College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

Hopkins was the brother of Rhode Island governor Stephen Hopkins, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and first Brown chancellor in conjunction with the tenure of president James Manning.

Hopkins was buried in the North Burial Ground of Providence, Rhode Island.

<text>Didyma (; ) was an ancient Greek sanctuary on the coast of Ionia in the domain of the famous city of Miletus. Apollo was the main deity of the sanctuary of Didyma, also called &quot;Didymaion&quot;. But it was home to both of the temples dedicated to the twins Apollo and Artemis. Other deities were also honoured within the sanctuary. The Didymaion was well renowned in antiquity because of its famed oracle. This oracle of Apollo was situated within what was, and is, one of the world&#x27;s greatest temples to Apollo. The remains of this Hellenistic temple belong to the best preserved temples of classical antiquity. Besides this temple other buildings existed within the sanctuary which have been rediscovered recently; a Greek theatre and the foundations of the above-mentioned Hellenistic temple of Artemis, to name but two.

==Geography==

The ruins of Didyma are located a short distance to the northwest of modern Didim in Aydın Province, Turkey, whose name is derived from the ruins. It sits on a headland that in antiquity formed the Milesian Peninsula. Didyma was the largest and most significant sanctuary on the territory of the great classical city Miletus. The natural connection between Miletus and Didyma was by way of ship. But during antiquity the sediments from the Meander River silted up the harbour of Miletus. A slow process which eventually meant that the nearby Latmian Gulf developed from a bay into a lake (today Bafa Gölü).

The linear distance between Miletus and Didyma measures some 16 km. As well as the simple footway there also existed a Sacred Way between the city and its sanctuary which measured some 20 km in distance. This Sacred Way, built in the 6th century BC, was used for festival processions. It touched the harbour of Didyma, situated 3 km northwest of the sanctuary called Panormos (today Mavişehir). Along this route were ritual waystations, and statues of noblemen and noblewomen, as well as animal and mythological beast figures. Some of these statues, dating to the 6th century BC, are now in the British Museum (Room 13), excavated by the British archaeologist Charles Thomas Newton in the 19th century.
The Milesians erected an altar dedicated to Poseidon 6 km southwest of Didyma. The altar was built in the first half of the 6th century BC at the southwest cape of the Milesian Peninsula. Here was the border between Ionia and Caria (according to Strabo). The remains of the altar are still visible and can be easily found due to the location of a nearby modern lighthouse. Architectural members of this famous altar can be seen in the Pergamon Museum of Berlin.

==Names==
In Greek &quot;didyma&quot; means &quot;twins&quot;, but the Greeks who sought a &quot;twin&quot; at Didyma ignored the Carian origin of the name. The Carians settled this area before the Ionian Greeks. Didyma was first mentioned among the Greeks in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. But its establishment is supposed to precede literacy and even the Hellenic colonization of Ionia around 1000 BC. In contrary the first archaeological pieces of evidence of Didyma date in the 8th century BC.

Mythic genealogies of the origins of the Branchidae line of priests, designed to capture the origins of Didyma as a Hellenic tradition, date to the Hellenistic period. Greek and Roman authors laboured to refer the name &quot;Didyma&quot; to &quot;twin&quot; temples or to temples of the twins Apollo and Artemis, whose own cult center at Didyma had then only recently been established. Also, as Wilamowitz suggested, there may be a connection to Cybele Dindymene, the &quot;Cybele of Mount Dindymon&quot;. Excavations by German archaeologists have lately uncovered the temple dedicated to Artemis, north of the temple of Apollo.

Apollo was worshipped in nearby Miletus under the name Delphinius (the same name was also used at Delphi). At Didyma, he was worshipped as Didymeus (Διδυμευς). His other names in the area were Philesios (), Helios, and Carinus ().

==History==

It is supposed that until its destruction by the Persians in 494 BC, Didyma&#x27;s sanctuary was administered by the family of the Branchidae, who claimed descent from an eponymous Branchos , a youth beloved of Apollo. The priestess, seated above the sacred spring, gave utterances that were interpreted by the Branchidae. Both Herodotus and Pausanias dated the origins of the oracle at Didyma before the Ionian colonization of this coast. Clement of Alexandria quotes Leandrios saying that Cleochus, grandfather of the eponymous founder Miletus, was buried within the temple enclosure of Didyma.

Under the Persian king Darius, following the naval battle of Lade, the sanctuary was burned in 494 BC. The Persians carried away the bronze cult statue of Apollo to Ecbatana, traditionally attributed to &quot;Canachus of Sicyon&quot; at the end in the 6th century BC. It was then reported that the oracle spring ceased to flow and the archaic oracle was silenced. Although the sanctuaries of Delphi and Ephesus were swiftly rebuilt, Didyma remained a ruin until the time Alexander the Great conquered Miletus and freed it from the Persians in 334 BC. In between a complete break had been rent in the oracles&#x27; personnel and tradition, the Branchidae priests marched off to Persian sovereign territory. Callisthenes, a court historian of Alexander, reported that the spring began once more to flow as Alexander passed through Egypt in 331 BC. 

After the liberation from the Persians the Milesians began to build a new temple for Apollo, which was the largest in the Hellenic world after the temple of Hera on the Isle of Samos and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Vitruvius recorded a tradition that the architects were Paeonius of Ephesus, whom Vitruvius credited with the rebuilding of the Temple of Artemis there, and Daphnis of Miletus. The dipteral temple of Apollo was surrounded by a double file of Ionic columns. From the pronaos lead two tunnels to the inner court. This was the location of the oracle spring, the sacred laurel tree and the naiskos - which was itself a small temple. It contained in its own small cella the bronze cult image of Apollo, brought back by Seleucus I Nicator from Persia about 300 BC.

In the Hellenistic period, beside Alexander, the kings Seleucus I and Seleucus II received oracles. So in the 3rd century BC the sanctuary of Apollo stood under the influence of the Seleucids, offering very rich donations to Apollo. Didyma suffered a serious setback in 277/76 BC, as Galatians looted it, coming from the Balkans to Asia Minor. Pliny reported the worship of &quot;Apollo Didymiae&quot;, Apollo of Didymus, in Central Asia, transported to Sogdiana by a general of Seleucus I and Antiochus I whose inscribed altars there were still to be seen by Pliny&#x27;s correspondents. Corroborating inscriptions on amphoras were found by I. R. Pichikyan at Dilbergin. 
Afterwards the kings of Bithynia made donations to the Didymaion in the 2nd century BC and the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt in the first half of 1st century BC.

The annual festival held in Didyma under the auspices of Miletus were called the Didymeia. They are first mentioned at the beginning 3rd century BC. A hundred years later they were made a Panhellenic (open to all Greeks) and a penteteric festival (they took place every four years). In the first half of the 1st century BC the Didymeia were banned because Miletus had supported Mithridates, in his war against the Romans. Furthermore, the sanctuary of Apollo was looted by pirates in 67 BC. After Pompey had reorganized the East of the Roman Empire, the Didymeia were permitted again in 63 BC. Some years later Julius Caesar expanded the area under asylum in Didyma. Apparently the Roman emperor Caligula tried to complete the huge temple of Apollo. Emperor Trajan renewed the Sacred Way between Miletus and Didyma as inscriptions prove in 101 AD. His successor Hadrian visited Miletus and Didyma in 129 AD and acted as Prophet - the highest office in the sanctuary. Under Commodus the Didymeia were held as the Commodeia for the cult of the emperor.

In Hellenistic and Roman times the sanctuary of Apollo flourished again. Numerous oracles of Apollo were imparted; some of them are extant in Roman inscriptions. These included inquiries and responses, and literary testimony records Didyma&#x27;s role as an oracle, with the &quot;grim epilogue&quot; of Apollo&#x27;s supposed sanction of Diocletian&#x27;s persecution of Christians, until the closing of the temples under Theodosius I. This was the end of the oracle. In Late Antiquity Didyma had been the seat of a bishop. Under Justinian I it was honoured with the title Iustinianopolis. In Byzantine times it changed the name to Hieronda deriving from the Greek name for sanctuary (hieron). This name was used for the village above the temple ruin until the early 20th century (Jeronda) and today the Turks continue to call it Yoran. About 1300 AD the Turks conquered this area of Ionia. Afterwards an earthquake in 1493 destroyed the temple of Apollo and the village was abandoned. About 300 years later the village was resettled by Greeks who used the broken ancient buildings as quarries.

== Modern investigations ==
When Ciriaco de&#x27; Pizzicolli visited the spot in 1446, it seems that the temple was still standing in great part, although the cella had been converted into a fortress by the Byzantines, but when the next European visitor, the Englishmen Jeremy Salter and Dr Pickering, arrived in 1673, it had collapsed. The Society of Dilettanti sent two expeditions to explore the ruins, the first in 1764 under Richard Chandler, the second in 1812 under William Gell. The French &quot;Rothschild Expedition&quot; of 1873 sent a certain amount of architectural sculpture to the Louvre, but no excavation was attempted until Emmanuel Pontremoli and Bernard Haussoullier were sent out by the French Schools of Rome and Athens in 1895. They cleared the eastern façade and partly the northern flank, and discovered inscriptions giving information about other parts.

German excavations made between 1905 and 1913 revealed all of the incomplete Hellenistic temple of Apollo and some carved fragments that belonged to the earlier Archaic temple and to associated statues. After the Second World War the German Archaeological Institute recommenced the investigations at Didyma in 1962. From now on not only the temple of Apollo was explored but the whole area surrounding the temple. In this way some unknown buildings were discovered. The huge district with the Sacred Way north of the temple of Apollo was excavated by Klaus Tuchelt. There he found the supposed sanctuary of Artemis. In 1979 Lothar Haselberger discovered scratched drawings on the walls in the courtyard of the temple of Apollo. A closer examination brought the first ancient blueprint of at least two temples (Apollo and Artemis) back to life. Under Klaus Tuchelt and Peter Schneider the Sacred Way from Miletus was investigated, especially the area outside of the sanctuary of Apollo. They found some of the stations of the procession from Miletus to Didyma. 

In 2003 Andreas Furtwaengler took over the directorship of the excavation of Didyma. His explorations were concentrated on the Archaic period of the Apollo temple and its close surroundings. Helga Bumke succeeded him 2013. She began in 2001 the exploration of the disposal site (the so-called Taxiarchis hill) of the debris from the Persian looting in 494 BC. Afterwards, also under her auspices, were the discovery of the Greek theatre in 2010/11 and during 2013 the foundations of the temple of Artemis and of another Hellenistic building, residing under a Byzantine chapel.

==Buildings==


===The temple of Apollo===
The Hellenistic temple had two predecessors. The first sacred building dedicated to Apollo was erected around 700 BC. It was probably a hekatompedos, which means 100 feet long. The width of this first sekos measured 10 meters. &#x27;Sekos&#x27; is Greek for ‘courtyard’; we can therefore deduce that the late geometric temple and its successors had never been roofed. The oldest temple of Apollo surrounded the sacred spring and the sacred laurel tree. This spring and tree formed the centre of the sanctuary for more than 1000 years.
From the middle of the 6th century BC the Milesians raised a new temple and constructed a new altar for Apollo. Alas, of this temple only the foundations of the sekos wall survived. Though as a lot of late Archaic column fragments were found it was likely a Dipteros, which means the sekos was surrounded by two rows of columns. These Ionic columns were partly ornamented with reliefs like the columns of the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. 
In the western half of the sekos the remains of a small temple were found, the so-called Naiskos, which housed the cult statue of Apollo. The sacred spring in its original location was already dry by the 6th c. BC and had diverted its position to the eastern half of the sekos. In front of this late Archaic temple was a circular building erected to surround the altar for Apollo, which, according to Pausanias, was made of blood and ashes of the sacrificed animals. This circular building with the conical altar inside was used until the end of antiquity, whilst to the east and south of the temple stood a stoa for storing some of the famous donations of Apollo.
The ramifications for the temple after the Ionians lost the naval battle off of the islands of Lade in 494 BC were that most of the buildings of Didyma were heavily damaged by the Persians. The planning for the new Hellenistic temple started after 334 BC. The Milesians resolved to build one of the greatest temples ever made. This goal was not really reached, but they built a temple with a unique plan. The temple of Apollo was clearly planned according to ritual requirements. Though at this present moment, the exact usage and function can only possibly be a matter of conjecture. 
The temple certainly attained the ambition of being one of the largest ancient temples ever built, its crepidoma with 7 steps measures almost 60 by 120 meters and the stylobate 51 by 109 meters. The temple building itself was surrounded by a double file of Ionic columns, each one of them 19.70 meters high. This consisted of 10 columns along the shorter sides and the 21 columns filling the longer sides, though not all of these were erected even by the end of antiquity. Above the columns followed the architraves with the frieze. The frieze is especially famous as it housed the impressively monumental heads of Medusa. 

The entrance was at the east side. With a pronaos of three rows of four columns, the approaching visitor passed through a regularized grove formed by the columns. The door usually leading to a cella was replaced by a blank wall with a large upper opening through which one could glimpse the upper part of the naiskos in the inner court (in inscriptions the inner court is referred to as &quot;sekos&quot; or &quot;adyton&quot;). The impassable threshold of this door stands 1.5 meters above the floor of the pronaos, while the entire door reaches a height of 14 meters. 
The entry route lay down either of two long constricted sloping tunnels built within the thickness of the walls and giving access to the inner court, still open to the sky but isolated from the world by the 25 meters high walls of the sekos. This was the location of the oracle spring, the laurel tree and the naiskos with the cult statue. The foundations of the naiskos are 8.24 meters wide and 14.23 meters long. This Ionic prostylos was built around 300 BC. It is famed because of the superior high quality of its ornamentation. The naiskos with the cult statue of Apollo is depicted on Imperial coins of Miletus. The sacred oracle spring was not situated in the naiskos, but in the eastern half of the sekos. It was found beneath the early Byzantine church. The inner walls of the sekos were articulated by pilasters. The capitals of them are ornamented with griffins and flowers. Among them a long frieze with griffins decorated the whole sekos. 

Between the two tunnel exits in the sekos a monumental staircase leads up to three openings into a room whose roof was supported by two columns on the central cross-axis. Among these three doors were placed two Corinthian half columns, whose spectacular capitals originally survived but during the First World War they were unfortunately destroyed. The room with the two central columns opened to the east to the great impassable portal. To the north and south of this hall two stairwells existed. In inscriptions they were called &quot;labyrinthoi&quot;, probably because of their ceiling decoration showing a meander pattern. These labyrinthoi lead to the roof of the temple and their function is not yet clear.
The oracular procedure so well documented at Delphi is almost unknown at Didyma and must be reconstructed on the basis of the temple&#x27;s construction. The priestess sat above the oracle spring and was inspired by Apollo. The prophet announced the oracle probably from the room with the high and impassable threshold. The answers were delivered, as in Delphi, in classical hexameters. But at Delphi, nothing was written; at Didyma, inquiries and answers were written and some inscriptions with them were found. In Didyma a small structure, the Chresmographion featured in this process; it was situated outside the temple because according to inscriptions it was used for storing architectural members for the temple there.
Although the construction work continued for over 600 years the temple of Apollo was never completed. But the main body of the temple itself had been completed around 100 BC. In the following centuries Miletus continued to erect the columns of the colonnade. The columns of the eastern façade were built during the reign of emperor Hadrian. The western facade was completed too and some columns on the flanks. The roof was also never entirely finished; the temple lacked the pediments.
There were also other parts of this huge temple which remained unfinished. Therefore, this building is totally unique in Greek architecture. It is like a handbook on this topic which informs you about all the different stages of constructing a temple. When something is unfinished it becomes easier to see the process of construction. This &quot;book&quot; begins in the quarries of Miletus at the former Latmian Gulf (today Bafa Gölü) and leads from the harbours there to the harbour of Didyma (former Panormos, today Mavisehir). From there along the road to the sanctuary and then into the sanctuary. At all these places unfinished architectural members of the temple are visible. 
The inner walls of the sekos remained unpolished too. That&#x27;s why Lothar Haselberger could discover there the Hellenistic construction drawings. This discovery and interpretation led to some important information about the planning and the building phase of the Apollo temple. In particular, the very famous one of the draft of a column of the temple of Apollo is on the northern sekos wall. On the western wall inside the sekos the inscribed pictorial instructions of the pediment of a small temple is scratched in. Because the inscribed architectural members are similar in style to the naiskos of Apollo, Haselberger and other scholars thought that it could have been the design drawings of the naiskos. But one problem persisted unsolved, because the drawn pediment is over 2 meters wider than the actual one of the naiskos of Apollo.

This perplexing enigma was eventually unravelled in 2012. It had been clear that the drawing on the western sekos wall would also suit to the rediscovered fragments of architectural members from the temple of Artemis also. So the Hellenistic temple of Artemis was designed with Apollo&#x27;s naiskos as a model, drawn upon the wall behind the naiskos in the 2nd century BC. The only existing problem was to find a foundation with the width of the drawing (10,71 meters).

===The temple of Artemis===

The foundations of the temple of Artemis were discovered in 2013 directly behind the mosque and former Greek Orthodox church of Saint Charalambos 100 m north of the temple of Apollo. In contrast to the temple of Apollo the foundation of the temple of Artemis is orientated exactly East-West, as it is common for most Greek temples. The remains of the foundations show that the temple had the dimensions of 31,60 meters long and 11,50 meters wide. The extant limestone blocks prove that the temple of Artemis had three rooms. Parts of its superstructure came not to light in situ. After the excavations the foundations were reinterred after each campaign, so today nothing is visible of them.
It is not altogether clear if the temple of Artemis was orientated to the east or to the west because its altar has not yet been found. During excavations at the east side came no remains of the altar to light, and the area in front of the west side has not yet been excavated. So it is more likely that the temple was orientated to the west because generally the altar was situated in front of Greek temples. This supposition is strengthened by the fact that the two most famous temples of Artemis in Asia Minor, at Ephesus and at Magnesia ad Maeandrum, were also faced to the west.

During excavations in 1994, to the south of the mosque, an Ionic architrave and frieze blocks of an unknown building had been excavated. These blocks of white marble bear almost the same pattern and size as architrave and frieze from the Hellenistic naiskos of Apollo. Therefore, it seemed likely they belonged to the elusive and tantalising temple of Artemis because of the twinning stylistic components. But this idea was only proven by Ulf Weber in 2012. The architrave and frieze blocks from the Artemis temple are deeper and wider than the ones from Apollo&#x27;s naiskos. A cornice block (consisting of geison and sima), already found in 1909, but first investigated in 2012 belongs to them. It was the keystone to solve the riddle.

For architrave, frieze and cornice are derived from a wider temple than the naiskos. Further they match perfectly to the construction drawing in the sekos. Finally this construction drawing matches the proportions of the new temple foundation. That means the Ionic temple of Artemis had four front columns and its length was exactly three times longer than its width.
Another difference between the naiskos of Apollo and the temple of his sister Artemis concerns the time of their construction. The ornamentation of the naiskos can stylistically be dated around 300 BC, but the ornaments of the temple of Artemis date in the 2nd century BC.
Hence the date of the new temple is known, but though it seems likely that it was dedicated to Artemis there remains speculation, especially as no inscription was found on the architectural members?

Older inscriptions from the 6th century BC show that beside Apollo, both Artemis and Hekate had been worshipped in Didyma. Another inscription from the 3rd century BC mentions the cult statue of Artemis. In later inscriptions reconstruction works of the temple of Artemis are reported. Therefore, there can be no doubt that Artemis had her own temple in Didyma. She was the main deity beside Apollo, and to no other deity worshipped in Didyma is a temple documented. Furthermore, Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo. All this leads to the conclusion that this temple designed according to Apollo&#x27;s naiskos must be the one of Artemis and it stood originally on the promontory north of the temple of Apollo.

In the end these results contradict Klaus Tuchelt&#x27;s view that the sanctuary of Artemis was situated west of the sacred way, as Helga Bumke had some years ago already suggested.

===Sacred Way with the Roman baths===

The Sacred Way inside the sanctuary of Apollo was excavated under Klaus Tuchelt. He found the remains of different buildings from the Archaic period along the wide and plastered road. To the west of the road the rock comes to the surface. Situated there were some wells, basins and small water canals. Their usage is not yet really clear, but they could have had a cultic function. Along the road during the Roman period stood a stoa. It also flanked the passageway to the Roman baths. So the stoai together with the water facilities make it more likely that the complex, of the so-called „Felsbarre&quot;, served for profane reasons. One option would be a function similar to a Roman macellum (food market), as proposed by Helga Bumke.

The Roman baths at the end of an alley were erected in the 2nd century AD. Rudolf Naumann investigated them and found impressive mosaics in the entrance hall, the apodyterium. It was followed by the frigidarium, the tepidarium and caldarium. The baths were used until the 6th/7th century AD, as were other buildings along the Sacred Way.

===Stadium===

Parallel to the southern colonnade of the temple of Apollo was situated a stadium which dates from the Hellenistic period, though athletic agons were probably held there earlier. The steps of the temple&#x27;s crepidoma served as seats for the spectators on the northern side of the stadium. Upon these seven steps are engraved many „topos inscriptions&quot;. 

That means the spectators marked their seats engraving their names. As these inscriptions are also found on the southern part of the western colonnade it seems likely that the stadium was longer than the south side of the temple of Apollo. The average stadium length was usually about 190 meters (one stadion). The seating on the southern side of the stadium consisted of tiers of limestone blocks with seven or eight steps. The remains of a device for starting the contests are extant near the southeast corner of the Apollo temple.

Astonishingly, the blocks of the southern tier of the stadium were reused for the cavea of the theatre in the second half of the 1st century AD. One can but assume that the music agons became more important and influential than the athletic ones.

===Theatre===

The remains of the theatre came to light during 2010 and 2011. The walls, stairs and steps of the cavea were a totally unexpected find. Evidence that the theatre arose in the second half of the 1st century AD is indicated by the find of a coin dating from the time of the Roman emperor Nero and a lot of sherds from the same period. Then the cavea had a diameter of 52 meters and could receive 3000 spectators. Later in the first half of the 2nd century AD it was enlarged to a diameter of 61 meters and 4000 spectators would have found a seat.

At this present time it has not been possible to excavate the foundations of the stage building, but the architectural members of a building typical for a scene building are known since the beginning of the 20th century. After the cavea of the theatre was excavated Helga Bumke suggested that the entablature of the so-called „Tabernakel&quot; building was part of the scene building. The inscribed dedications on the architraves reveals that the stage building was consecrated to the gods Apollo, Artemis, Leto, Zeus, the emperor Hadrian and the people of Miletus. But it is not known who dedicated this building. As emperor Hadrian visited Miletus and Didyma in 129 AD the scene building was probably complete by that time. The winners of the musical contests, organized to worship Apollo, were honoured in several inscriptions from the Roman period. These competitions took place in the newly found theatre, but it can be assumed that a Hellenistic predecessor existed. An inscription from the beginning 3rd century BC reports that Antiochos I received a seat of honour during the choir contests at Didyma.

===Other Buildings===
The ancient inscriptions of Didyma testify that many more buildings existed there in antiquity than the mentioned ones above. During the many years of excavations hundreds of architectural fragments came to light which could be not allocated to a known building or monument. One of them is a Doric stoa from the 2nd century BC, and another one the so-called „Prophetenhaus&quot; or chresmographeion, a smaller Doric building also from the 2nd century BC. The search of the foundations of these and other structures is difficult because the area around Apollo&#x27;s temple is closely built-up. Therefore, it is almost impossible to use geophysical prospecting methods for the search. Interpreting the written sources and old maps make it possible to find places with ancient foundations. This was done by Helga Bumke in the case of the foundation of the temple of Artemis and another Hellenistic foundation southeast of the temple of Apollo in 2013. This squarish substructure measuring 11 meters by 12 meters consisted of limestone blocks, but no superstructure came to light. It may have had a cultic function because it is characterised by the same curious orientation as the temple of Apollo (or it was used as a propylon). Above the substructure was a small church built in Byzantine times which has seen several reconstructions up until the 19th century.

===Churches===

The most famous church of Didyma stood in the sekos of the temple of Apollo. Its final remains were demolished in 1925. This church was made with blocks from the naiskos and other small buildings from outside the temple around 500 AD. After a serious earthquake in the 7th century AD, a reconstruction of the three-aisled basilica was erected. In the 11th century AD, another earthquake occurred and the church in the sekos collapsed. This was replaced by only a small chapel which was used for the Christian cult. 
Another early Christian church was constructed 100 meters north of the temple of Apollo, at approximately the same location where today the mosque stands. This church also employed the use of ancient blocks salvaged from the temple of Artemis nearby and the previously mentioned Doric stoa above. Its later history is not yet clear, but in 1830 their remains were used to erect a new church (dedicated to Saint Charalambos) for the recently arrived Greek settlers. In 1924 it was converted into a mosque for the Muslims just transported from North Greece during the Exchange of Populations.

More chapels or churches surely existed in Byzantine Didyma because it was the seat of a bishopric, but about this age little is known. Some of these Byzantine churches either fell into disrepair or used as animal pens after the area was abandoned in the 16th century and reused by the newly settled Greeks at the end of the 18th century when the quarrying of the temple marble became a profitable trade.

<doc id="824248" wikidata="Q3208255" url="?curid=824248" title="Orpheus Descending">
<text>Orpheus Descending is a three-act play by Tennessee Williams. It was first presented on Broadway on March 17, 1957, with Maureen Stapleton and Cliff Robertson, under the direction of Harold Clurman, but had only a brief run (68 performances) and modest success. It was revived on Broadway in 1989, directed by Peter Hall and starring Vanessa Redgrave and Kevin Anderson. The production ran for 13 previews and 97 performances.

The play is a rewrite of an earlier play by Williams called &quot;Battle of Angels&quot;, which was written in 1940. Williams wrote the character of Myra Torrance for Tallulah Bankhead, but she turned down the role, saying &quot;The play is impossible, darling, but sit down and have a drink with me.&quot; The production previewed in Boston the same year, starring Miriam Hopkins. It was the first produced play written by Williams and by his account it &quot;failed spectacularly&quot;. At one point, Boston&#x27;s city censors and the City Council threatened to shut down the production over its &quot;lascivious and immoral&quot; language. &quot;Battle of Angels&quot; remained un-produced in New York for 34 years, until the Circle Repertory Company opened their sixth season with it in 1974, directed by Marshall W. Mason.

Williams was rewriting &quot;Battle of Angels&quot; by 1951. When &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; appeared in 1957, Williams wrote: &quot;On the surface it was and still is the tale of a wild-spirited boy who wanders into a conventional community of the South and creates the commotion of a fox in a chicken coop. But beneath that now familiar surface it is a play about unanswered questions that haunt the hearts of people and the difference between continuing to ask them...and the acceptance of prescribed answers that are not answers at all.&quot;

== Description ==
The play is a modern retelling of the ancient Greek Orpheus legend and deals, in the most elemental fashion, with the power of passion, art, and imagination to redeem and revitalize life, giving it new meaning. The story is set in a dry goods store in a small southern town marked, in the play, by conformity, sexual frustration, narrowness, and racism. Into this scene steps Val, a young man with a guitar, a snakeskin jacket, a questionable past, and undeniable animal-erotic energy and appeal. He gets a job in the dry goods store run by a middle-aged woman named Lady, whose elderly husband is dying. Lady has a past and passions of her own. She finds herself attracted to Val and to the possibility of new life he seems to offer. It is a tempting antidote to her loveless marriage and boring, small-town life. The play describes the awakening of passion, love, and life – as well as its tragic consequences for Val and Lady.

The play deals with passion, its repression and its attempted recovery. On another level, it is also about trying to live bravely and honestly in a fallen world. The play is replete with lush, poetic dialogue and imagery. On the stage, the opening sections seem somewhat lacking in dramatic movement, but the play picks up power as the characters are developed and it moves to its climax. Val, a metaphor for Orpheus, represents the forces of energy and eros, which, buried as they are in compromise and everyday mundanity, have the tragic power to create life anew.

== Plot ==
Dolly and Beulah, two gossiping housewives, tell each other that Jabe Torrance has just had surgery in Memphis but is dying. Carol Cutrere comes in a little later and Val, a roaming singer and musician, comes into the general store. Carol flirts with Val, insisting she has met him before in New Orleans, but he denies any prior knowledge of her. Lady agrees to hire Val as a clerk.

After a few weeks, Val tells Lady about his wild past in New Orleans and admits that he once knew Carol. When David enters the store, Lady tells David that she aborted his child when he left her. Val and Vee are talking about her painting when Vee&#x27;s husband, Talbot, catches him kissing her hand. Lady allows Val to stay at the store, but Val steals money from the cashbox when she leaves to get linens for the bed. Val returns the money and wants to leave, but Lady begs him to stay.

On Easter, Jabe tells Lady he was responsible for her father&#x27;s death and has a hemorrhage. At sunset, Vee says she has been blinded by a vision of the risen Christ and Val is yelled at by Vee&#x27;s husband for helping her up. Vee&#x27;s husband, Sheriff Talbot, tells him he has until sunrise to get out of town. Val is ready to leave but Lady tries to stop him. She tries to get the nurse to kill her husband with a lethal dose of morphine, but the nurse will not. Then Lady tells Val she is happily pregnant with his child, and tells Val she looks forward to a new life because of this.

Both walk about the newly decorated refreshment emporium adjoining the store, symbolizing the promise of a new start. As Val and Lady embrace, Val looks up to see that Jabe has torn a hole through his floor, and thus through the ceiling of the emporium, and is throwing coal oil into the place, setting it on fire while yelling out the upstairs window that Val has set the place on fire and is &quot;robbing the place.&quot; Lady escapes through the door of the emporium and heads up the stairs towards Jabe&#x27;s room yelling &quot;No Jabe, no!&quot; whereupon Jabe shoots Lady on the stairway. As Lady dies, the local sheriff and fire squad break through the front door, and seeing Val trying to get out of the emporium, open their water hoses full force in an ultimately successful attempt to push him back into the burning building, thus murdering him. Lady calls out for him while dying from her husband Jabe&#x27;s gunshots.

In the final scene, Carol walks in the remains of the burnt-out emporium while another transient looks about and discovers Val&#x27;s snakeskin jacket. Carol trades a gold ring for the jacket and offers a soliloquy on &quot;the fugitive kind.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
In 1959, a screen adaptation starring Marlon Brando and Anna Magnani appeared under the title &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot;; it was directed by Sidney Lumet, and flopped like the stage production. &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, a film adaptation of the Peter Hall stage production, was released in 1990, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The play was also adapted as a two-act opera by Bruce Saylor and J.D. McClatchy in 1994.

<text>Witold Pilecki (; 13 May 190125 May 1948), known by the codenames &quot;Roman Jezierski&quot;, &quot;Tomasz Serafiński&quot;, &quot;Druh&quot; and &quot;Witold&quot;, was a Polish World War II cavalry officer, intelligence agent, and resistance leader.

As a youth, Pilecki joined Polish underground scouting; in the aftermath of World War I, he joined the Polish militia and, later, the Polish Army. He participated in the Polish–Soviet War, which ended in 1921. In 1939, he participated in the unsuccessful defense of Poland against the German invasion and, shortly afterward, joined the Polish resistance, co-founding the Secret Polish Army resistance movement. In 1940, Pilecki volunteered to allow himself to be captured by the occupying Germans in order to infiltrate the Auschwitz concentration camp. At Auschwitz, he organized a resistance movement that eventually included hundreds of inmates, and he secretly drew up reports detailing German atrocities at the camp, which were smuggled out to Home Army headquarters and shared with the Western Allies. After eventually escaping from Auschwitz in April 1943, Pilecki fought in the Warsaw Uprising of August–October 1944. Following its suppression, he was interned in a German prisoner-of-war camp. After the communist takeover of Poland, he remained loyal to the London-based Polish government-in-exile. In 1945, he returned to Poland to report to the government-in-exile on the situation in Poland. Before returning, Pilecki compiled his previous reports into &quot;Witold&#x27;s Report&quot; to detail his Auschwitz experiences, anticipating that he might be killed by Poland&#x27;s new communist authorities. In 1947, he was arrested by the secret police on charges of working for &quot;foreign imperialism&quot; and, after being subjected to torture and a show trial, was executed in 1948.

His story, inconvenient to the Polish communist authorities, remained mostly unknown for several decades; one of the first accounts of Pilecki&#x27;s mission to Auschwitz was given by Polish historian Józef Garliński, himself a former Auschwitz inmate who emigrated to Britain after the war, in &quot;Fighting Auschwitz: The Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp&quot; (1975). Several monographs appeared in subsequent years, particularly after the fall of communism in Poland facilitated research into his life by Polish historians.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Witold Pilecki was born on 13 May 1901 in the town of Olonets, Karelia, in the Russian Empire. He was a descendant of a Polish-speaking noble family (szlachta) of the Leliwa coat of arms. His ancestors had been deported to Russia from their home in Lithuania (former Nowogródek Voivodeship region, now in Belarus) for participating in the January 1863–64 Uprising, for which a major part of their estate was confiscated. Witold was one of five children of forest inspector Julian Pilecki and Ludwika Osiecimska.

In 1910, Witold moved with his mother and siblings to Vilnius, to attend a Polish school there, while his father remained in Olonets. In Vilnius, Pilecki attended a local school and joined the underground Polish Scouting and Guiding Association (&quot;Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego&quot;, &quot;ZHP&quot;).

Following the outbreak of World War I, in 1916 Pilecki was sent by his mother to a school in the Russian city of Oryol, located safer in the East than Vilnius. There he attended a gymnasium (secondary school) and founded a local chapter of the &quot;ZHP&quot;.

===Polish–Soviet War===
In 1918, following the outbreak of the Russian Revolution and the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, Pilecki returned to Vilnius, then outside the control of the Polish government, and joined the ZHP section of the Self-Defence of Lithuania and Belarus, a paramilitary formation under Major General Władysław Wejtko. The militia disarmed the passing German troops and took up positions to defend the city from a looming attack by the Soviet Red Army. After Vilnius fell to Bolshevik forces on 5 January 1919, Pilecki and his unit resorted to partisan warfare behind Soviet lines. He and his comrades then retreated to Białystok, where Pilecki enlisted as a &quot;szeregowy&quot; (private) in Poland&#x27;s newly-established Army. He fought in the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1920, serving under Captain Jerzy Dąbrowski and being involved in the Vilna offensive. He fought in the Kiev offensive (1920) and as part of a cavalry unit defending the then-Polish city of Grodno. On 5 August 1920, Pilecki joined the and fought in the crucial Battle of Warsaw and then in the Rūdninkai Forest. Pilecki later was involved in the Polish–Lithuanian War as a member of the October 1920 Żeligowski&#x27;s Mutiny where Polish troops occupied Vilnius in a false-flag operation.

===Interwar years===
By the conclusion of Polish-Soviet War in March 1921, Pilecki was promoted to the rank of &quot;plutonowy&quot; (corporal), becoming a non-commissioned officer. Shortly afterward, Pilecki was transferred to the army reserves, completing courses required for a non-commissioned officer rank at the Cavalry Reserve Officers&#x27; Training School in Grudziądz. He went on to complete his secondary education (&quot;matura&quot;) later that same year. He briefly enrolled with the Faculty of Fine Arts at Stefan Batory University but was forced to abandon his studies in 1924 due to both financial issues and the declining health of his father. In July 1925, Pilecki was assigned to the 26th Lancer Regiment with the rank of &quot;Chorąży&quot; (ensign). Pilecki would be promoted to &quot;podporucznik&quot; (second lieutenant, with seniority from 1923) the following year. Also in September 1926, Pilecki became the owner of his family&#x27;s ancestral estate, Sukurcze, in the Lida District of the Nowogródek Voivodeship. In 1931, he married . They had two children, born in Vilnius over the next two years: Andrzej and . Pilecki actively supported the local farming community. He was also an amateur poet and painter. He organized the &quot;Krakus&quot; Military Horsemen Training program in 1932 and was appointed to command the 1st Lida Military Training Squadron, which in 1937 was placed under the Polish 19th Infantry Division. In 1938, Pilecki received the Silver Cross of Merit for his activities.

===World War II===
====Polish September Campaign====
With Polish–German tensions growing in mid-1939, Pilecki was mobilized as a cavalry platoon commander on 26 August 1939. He was assigned to the 19th Infantry Division under Major General Józef Kwaciszewski, part of the Army Prusy and his unit took part in heavy fighting against the advancing Germans during the invasion of Poland. The 19th Division was almost completely destroyed following a clash with the German forces on the night of 5/6 September at the Battle of Piotrków Trybunalski. Its remains were incorporated into the 41st Infantry Division, which was withdrawn to the southeast toward Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine) and the Romanian bridgehead. In the 41st Division, Pilecki served as divisional second-in-command of its cavalry detachment, under Major Jan Włodarkiewicz. He and his men destroyed seven German tanks, shot down one aircraft, and destroyed two more on the ground. On 17 September, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland, which worsened the already desperate situation of the Polish forces. On 22 September, the 41st Division suffered a major defeat and capitulated. Włodarkiewicz and Pilecki were among the many soldiers who did not follow the order of Commander-in-Chief General Edward Śmigły-Rydz to retreat through Romania to France, instead opting to stay underground in Poland.

====Resistance====
On 9 November 1939 in Warsaw, Major Włodarkiewicz, Second Lieutenant Pilecki, Second Lieutenant Jerzy Maringe, Jerzy Skoczyński, and brothers Jan and Stanisław Dangel founded the Secret Polish Army (&quot;&quot;, &quot;TAP&quot;), one of the first underground organizations in Poland. Włodarkiewicz became its leader, while Pilecki became TAP&#x27;s organizational head as it expanded to cover Warsaw, Siedlce, Radom, Lublin, and other major cities in central Poland. As cover, Pilecki worked as manager of a cosmetics storehouse. From 25 November 1939 until May 1940, he was TAP&#x27;s inspector and chief of staff. From August 1940, he headed its 1st branch (organization and mobilization).

TAP was based on Christian ideological values. While Pilecki wanted to avert a religious mission so as not to alienate potential allies, Włodarkiewicz blamed Poland&#x27;s defeat on its failure to create a Catholic nation and wanted to remake the country by appealing to right-wing groups. In the spring of 1940, Pilecki saw that Włodarkiewicz&#x27;s views had become more anti-semitic and that he had put ultranationalist dogma into their newsletter, &quot;&quot;; Włodarkiewicz had also entered into talks about a merger with the far-right underground, including a group that had offered Nazi Germany a Polish puppet government. To stop him, Pilecki went to Colonel Stefan Rowecki, chief of a rival resistance group, the Union of Armed Struggle (&quot;Związek Walki Zbrojnej&quot;, &quot;ZWZ&quot;), which called for equal rights for Jews, gathered intelligence on German atrocities, and delivered it by courier to the Western Allies in an attempt to gain their involvement. The ZWZ had alerted the Polish Government-in-Exile that the Germans were inciting Polish hatred against the Jews, and that this might lead to the rise of a Polish Quisling.

Pilecki called for TAP to submit to Rowecki&#x27;s authority, but Włodarkiewicz refused and issued a manifesto that the future Poland had to be Christian, based on national identity, and that those who opposed the idea should be &quot;removed from our lands&quot;. Pilecki refused to swear the proposed oath. In August, Włodarkiewicz announced at a TAP meeting that they would, after all, join the mainstream underground with Rowecki – and that it has been proposed that Pilecki should infiltrate the Auschwitz concentration camp. Little was known about how the Germans ran the then-new camp, which was thought to be an internment camp or large prison rather than a death camp. Włodarkiewicz said it was not an order but an invitation to volunteer, though Pilecki saw it as a punishment for refusing to back Włodarkiewicz&#x27;s ideology. Nevertheless he agreed, which years later led to him being described in many sources as having volunteered to infiltrate Auschwitz.

====Auschwitz====
Pilecki was one of 2,000 men arrested on 19 September 1940. He used the identity documents of Tomasz Serafiński, who had been mistakenly assumed to be dead. Two backstories exist purporting to explain how Pilecki actually found himself in Auschwitz. In one version, he allowed himself to be captured by the occupying Germans in one of their Warsaw street round-ups, in order to infiltrate the camp. In the second version, he did that in the apartment of Eleonora Ostrowska, at &quot;ulica&quot; Wojska Polskiego (Polish Army Street) during a building search. Afterward, along with 1,705 other prisoners, between 21 and 22 September 1940, Pilecki reached Auschwitz where, under Serafiński&#x27;s name, he was assigned prisoner number 4859. In autumn of 1941 he learnt that he had been promoted to &quot;porucznik&quot; (first lieutenant) by people &quot;far away in the outside world in Warsaw&quot;.

While in various slave labor &quot;kommandos&quot; and surviving pneumonia at Auschwitz, Pilecki organized an underground Military Organization Union (&quot;Związek Organizacji Wojskowej&quot;, &quot;ZOW&quot;). Its tasks were to improve the morale of the inmates, provide news from outside the camp, distribute extra food and clothing to its members, set up intelligence networks, and train detachments to take over the camp in the event of a relief attack. &quot;ZOW&quot; was organized as secret cells, each of five members. Over time, many smaller underground organizations at Auschwitz eventually merged with &quot;ZOW&quot;.

As part of his duties, Pilecki secretly drew up reports and sent them to Home Army headquarters with the help of inmates that had been released or escapees. The first dispatch, delivered in October 1940, described the camp and the ongoing extermination of inmates via starvation and brutal punishments; it was used as the basis of a Home Army report on &quot;The terror and lawlessness of the occupiers&quot;. Further dispatches of Pilecki&#x27;s were likewise smuggled out by inmates who managed to escape from Auschwitz. The reports&#x27; purpose may have been to get the Home Army command&#x27;s permission for &quot;ZOW&quot; to stage an uprising to liberate the camp; however, no such response came from the Home Army. In 1942, Pilecki&#x27;s resistance movement was also using a home-made radio transmitter to broadcast details on the number of arrivals and deaths in the camp and the conditions of the inmates. The secret radio station was built over seven months using smuggled parts. It broadcast from the camp until the autumn of 1942, when it was dismantled by Pilecki&#x27;s men after concerns that the Germans might discover its location because of &quot;one of our fellows&#x27; big mouth&quot;. The information provided by Pilecki was a principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies. Pilecki hoped that either the Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp, or that the Home Army would organize an assault on it from outside.

The Camp Gestapo under SS-Untersturmführer Maximilian Grabner redoubled its efforts to ferret out &quot;ZOW&quot; members, killing many of them. To avoid the worst outcome, Pilecki decided to break out of the camp with the hope of convincing Home Army leaders that a rescue attempt was a valid option. On the night of 26–27 April 1943 Pilecki was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence, and he and two comrades managed to force open a metal door, overpower a guard, cut the telephone line, and escape outside the camp perimeter. They left the SS guards in the woodshed, barricaded from outside. Before escaping they cut an alarm wire. They headed east, and after several hours crossed into the General Government, taking with them documents stolen from the Germans. The men fled on foot to the village of Alwernia where they were helped by a priest, and then on to Tyniec where locals assisted them. Later, they reached the Polish resistance safe house near Bochnia, owned, coincidentally, by commander Tomasz Serafiński—the very man whose identity Pilecki had adopted for his cover in Auschwitz. At one point during the journey, German soldiers attempted to stop Pilecki, firing at him as he fled; several bullets passed through his clothing, while one wounded him without hitting either bones or vital organs.

====Outside Auschwitz====
After several days as a fugitive, Pilecki made contact with units of the Home Army. In June 1943, in Nowy Wiśnicz, Pilecki drafted a report on the situation in Auschwitz. It was buried at the farm where he was staying and was only revealed after his death. In August 1943, back in Warsaw, Pilecki started preparing Witold&#x27;s Report (&quot;Raport W&quot;), which focused on the Auschwitz underground. It covered three main topics: &quot;ZOW&quot; and its members; Pilecki&#x27;s experiences; and to a lesser extent, the extermination of prisoners, including Jews. Pilecki&#x27;s intent in writing it was to persuade the Home Army to liberate the camp&#x27;s prisoners. However, the Home Army command judged such an attack would fail. Even if the initial attack were successful, the resistance lacked sufficient transport capabilities, supplies, and the shelter that would be required for the rescued inmates. The Soviet Red Army, despite being within attacking distance of the camp, showed no interest in a joint effort with the Home Army and the &quot;ZOW&quot; to free it.

Shortly after rejoining the resistance, Pilecki became a member of the &quot;Kedyw&quot; sabotage unit, using the pseudonym &quot;Roman Jezierski&quot;. He also joined a secret anti-communist organization, &quot;NIE&quot;. On 19 February 1944 he was promoted to cavalry captain (&quot;rotmistrz&quot;). Until becoming involved in the Warsaw Uprising, Pilecki continued coordinating &quot;ZOW&quot; and Home Army activities and providing &quot;ZOW&quot; with what limited support he could.

In Auschwitz, Pilecki had met the author Igor Newerly, whose Jewish wife, Barbara, was hiding in Warsaw. The Newerlys had been working with Janusz Korczak to try to save Jewish lives. Pilecki gave Barbara Newerly money from the Polish resistance, which she passed on to several Jewish families whom she and her husband protected. He also gave her money to pay off her own &quot;szmalcownik&quot;, or blackmailer, who said he was Jewish and threatened to report her to the Gestapo. The blackmailer disappeared, with Jack Fairweather concluding that &quot;it is likely that Witold arranged for his execution&quot;.

====Warsaw Uprising====
When the Warsaw Uprising broke out on 1 August 1944, Pilecki volunteered for service with of Kedyw&#x27;s Chrobry II Battalion. Initially, he served as a common soldier in the northern city centre, without revealing his rank to his superiors. After many officers were killed in the early days of the uprising, Pilecki revealed his true identity and accepted command of the 1st &quot;Warszawianka&quot; Company deployed in Warsaw&#x27;s &quot;Śródmieście&quot; (downtown) district. After the fall of the uprising, which ended on 2 October that year, he was captured and taken prisoner by the Germans. He was sent to Oflag VII-A, a prison-of-war camp for Polish officers located north of Murnau, Bavaria, where he remained until the prisoners were liberated on 29 April 1945.

===After the war===
In July 1945, Pilecki joined the military intelligence division of the Polish II Corps under Lieutenant General Władysław Anders in Ancona, Italy. In October 1945, as relations between the government-in-exile and the Soviet-backed regime of Bolesław Bierut kept deteriorating, Pilecki was ordered by Anders and his intelligence chief, Lieutenant Colonel Stanisław Kijak, to return to Poland and report on the prevailing military and political situation under Soviet occupation. By December 1945 he had arrived in Warsaw and begun organizing an intelligence gathering network. As the NIE organization had been disbanded, Pilecki recruited former &quot;ZOW&quot; and &quot;TAP&quot; members and continued sending information to the government-in-exile.

To maintain his cover identity, Pilecki lived under various assumed names and changed jobs frequently. He worked as a jewelry salesman, a bottle label painter, and as the night manager of a construction warehouse. However, in July 1946 he was informed that his identity had been uncovered by the Ministry of Public Security. Anders ordered him to leave Poland, but Pilecki was reluctant to comply because he had a family in the country and his wife was unwilling to emigrate with their children, as well as due to a lack of a suitable replacement. In early 1947, his superiors rescinded the order.

Arrested on 8 May 1947 by the communist authorities, Pilecki was tortured, but in order to protect other operatives, he did not reveal any sensitive information. His case was supervised by Colonel Roman Romkowski. A show trial, chaired by Lieutenant Colonel , took place on 3 March 1948. Pilecki was charged with illegal border crossings, use of forged documents, failure to enlist in the military, the carrying of illegal firearms, espionage for Anders, espionage for &quot;foreign imperialism&quot; (government-in-exile), and assassination plots against several officials of the Ministry of Public Security. Pilecki denied the assassination charges, as well as espionage, although he admitted to passing information to the II Corps, of which he considered himself an officer and thus claimed that he was not breaking any laws. He pleaded guilty to the other charges. He was sentenced to death on 15 May with three of his comrades. Pleas for pardon from a number of Auschwitz survivors were ignored; one of their recipients was Polish prime minister Józef Cyrankiewicz, also an Auschwitz survivor. Cyrankiewicz, who had already testified at the trial, instead wrote that Pilecki must be treated harshly as an &quot;enemy of the state&quot;. Subsequently, on 25 May 1948, Pilecki was executed by Piotr Śmietański with a shot to the back of the head at the Mokotów Prison in Warsaw. Several of Pilecki&#x27;s affiliates were also arrested and tried around the same time, with at least three executed as well; a number of others received death sentences that commuted to prison sentences. Pilecki&#x27;s burial place has never been found, though it is thought to be in Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Pilecki&#x27;s life has been a subject of several monographs. The first in English was Józef Garliński&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Auschwitz: The Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp&quot; (1975), followed by M. R. D. Foot&#x27;s &quot;Six Faces of Courage&quot; (1978). The first in Polish was the &quot;Rotmistrz Pilecki&quot; (1995) by Wiesław Jan Wysocki, followed by &quot;Ochotnik do Auschwitz. Witold Pilecki 1901–1948&quot; (2000) by Adam Cyra. In 2010, Italian historian Marco Patricelli wrote a book about Witold Pilecki, &quot;Il volontario&quot; (2010), which received the Acqui Award of History that year. In 2012, Pilecki&#x27;s Auschwitz diary was translated into English by Garliński and published under the title &quot;The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery&quot;. Poland&#x27;s Chief Rabbi, Michael Schudrich, wrote in the foreword to a 2012 English translation of Pilecki&#x27;s report: &quot;When God created the human being, God had in mind that we should all be like Captain Witold Pilecki, of blessed memory.&quot; Historian Norman Davies wrote in the introduction to the same translation: &quot;If there was an Allied hero who deserved to be remembered and celebrated, this was a person with few peers.&quot; More recently Pilecki was the subject of Adam J. Koch&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;A Captain’s Portrait: Witold Pilecki – Martyr for Truth&quot; and Jack Fairweather&#x27;s 2019 book &quot;The Volunteer: The True Story of the Resistance Hero Who Infiltrated Auschwitz&quot;, the latter a winner of the Costa Book Award&quot;.&quot;

From the 1990s, following the fall of communism in Poland and Pilecki&#x27;s subsequent rehabilitation, he has been a subject of popular discourse. A number of institutions, monuments, and streets in Poland have been named after him. In 1995, he was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta, and in 2006, the highest Polish decoration, the Order of the White Eagle. On 6 September 2013, the Minister of National Defence announced his promotion to colonel. In 2012, Powązki Cemetery was partly excavated in an unsuccessful effort to find his remains.

In 2016, &quot;The Pilecki Family House Museum&quot; (&quot;Dom Rodziny Pileckich&quot;) was established in Ostrów Mazowiecka; it opened officially in 2019, but its permanent exhibition is still being prepared, with public opening planned for May 2022. The year 2017 saw the founding of the Pilecki Institute, a Polish government institution commemorating persons who helped Polish victims of war crimes and crimes against peace or humanity in the years 1917–1990.

The 2006 film &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Death of Cavalry Captain Pilecki&quot;), directed by Ryszard Bugajski, presents Pilecki as an ethically flawless man facing unfounded accusations. The narrative structure is reminiscent of a saint&#x27;s martyrology, with belief in God replaced by belief in Country.

In 2014, the Swedish band Sabaton recorded a song about him, &quot;Inmate 4859&quot;, on the album &quot;Heroes&quot;.

A 2015 film, &quot;&quot;, by Marcin Kwaśny, portrays Pilecki as an independence-movement saint. The sacralization is achieved by recounting verified historical facts, along with dramatized scenes. The film shows Pilecki performing deeds impossible for an ordinary man, while keeping faith with his country even under the direst torture.
